5000|$|A {{variable}} {{system that}} uses [...] "active fins" [...] {{designed specifically for}} roll attenuation of a vessel while underway achieves lifting force through {{the flow of water}} over the fin's surface. By increasing the angle of attack of the fin to the water flow to some maximum working angle, a maximum lift force can be achieved for stabilising the hull. When these same systems are used for roll stabilisation of stationary vessels, the lift force available from water flow over the fin while underway is not available. For a <b>stationary</b> <b>vessel,</b> the ability to generate a lifting force (i.e. roll-resisting force) is limited to that achieved by any powered fin movements, and by the water volume displaced while stroking the fins in one direction at a precise point in time. Active fin systems can provide incremental add-on stability for vessels at rest, but these systems will usually have larger actuators and fins, and will likely have special power source requirements in comparison to systems designed for stability underway.|$|E

5000|$|Each side {{blames the}} other for the incident, arguing that the skipper of the other vessel miscalculated during a {{dangerous}} maneuver. Bethune {{has said that he}} believes the captain of the Japanese vessel had miscalculated while trying to scrape the bow of the Ady Gil. In a statement released by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, Chuck Swift, who witnessed the incident from his ship, the Bob Barker, claimed that both vessels were stationary in the water when the Shōnan Maru 2 [...] "started up and then steered deliberately into the Ady Gil". Paul Watson initially claimed that the Ady Gil was almost stationary in the water when the Shōnan Maru 2 suddenly changed course and then steered deliberately into it. However, Watson later stated that [...] "One only needs to watch the video to see that Bethune negligently stopped his ship {{in the path of the}} whaling vessel and it was cut in half". Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research blames the collision on Sea Shepherd, who they say were attempting to entangle their rudder and propeller by repeatedly crossing their bow with lines. The Japanese Fisheries Agency said that the Shōnan Maru 2 had employed a water cannon to deter the Ady Gil, but the anti-whaling vessel undertook manoeuvres like suddenly reducing speed, resulting in the collision. Opinions in news media organisations vary similarly. Some blame the Ady Gil for powering up to intentionally propel itself into the whaler's path, some accuse the Shōnan Maru 2 of intentionally ramming a <b>stationary</b> <b>vessel</b> - with both sides basing their views primarily on the released video footage. Others place the blame more evenly. An investigation into the collision by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) was inconclusive and unable to assign blame for the collision. AMSA was unable to verify claims made by Sea Shepherd, while the Japanese government declined to participate with the investigation saying any information it had might be needed for an inquiry by its own authorities. [...] New Zealand authorities found both parties were at fault for the collision. The inquiry by Maritime New Zealand found that the Shonan Maru No. 2 should have kept clear of the Ady Gil under international collision regulations, and had ample opportunity to avoid hitting it. It also found that the Ady Gil failed to take avoiding action, and its helmsman did not see the Japanese ship bearing down until seconds before the impact.|$|E

40|$|The in situ {{measurement}} of target strength (TS) depends on exactly one fish being within the sampled volume. This {{is more likely to}} occur the nearer the transducer is to the fish targets. The detection rate can be improved by lowering the transducer on a cable from a <b>stationary</b> <b>vessel,</b> so decreasing the range to the observed fish. In this application, a standard sphere is commonly suspended below the transducer to provide the real-time calibration of the received signals. However, forward scattering by the sphere distorts the trans-mitted pulse, and equally the returning fish echoes, causing a bias in the estimated TS. Further, for a split-beam transducer, forward-scattering of the fish echo by the sphere modifies the phase differences observed between the transducer segments. This changes the apparent distribution of targets, but not the estimated TS. The biases are not large, those considered being within + 0. 9 dB, and they depend on the sonar frequency, the target range, and the direction. The theory of these effects is examined, and formulae are provided for correcting the observed fish echo to that which would be received in free-field conditions, i. e. with the sphere removed...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{underwater}} vessel noise {{over the past}} sixty years has predominantly focused upon the increase in ambient noise caused by the propulsion mechanisms of large commercial vessels.

Few studies have investigated the noise contribution of smaller vessels or ambient noise levels present in coastal and in-shore waters. This study aimed to identify the level of noise common to non-commercial harbors by studying the noise emissions of a diesel generator on board a 70 m long sailing vessel. Propagation patterns revealed an unconventional shape (specific to the precise location of the noise source on board the vessel), unlike those of standard geometric spreading models, as typically assumed when predicting vessel noise emission. Harbor attributes (including water depth, ground sediment and structural material components) caused for altered level and frequency characteristics of the recorded underwater noise, and were correlated to the sound measurements made.

40|$|Long {{distance}} ocean towing is {{a commonly}} used transportation method {{in the oil}} & gas and renewable energy industries. Barges with cargo, vessels and various offshore structures are towed from and to location. Boskalis participates in this industry through its subsidiaries Smit and Fairmount Marine. From experience with these transports, {{it was found that}} the preliminary calculations do not match with the experiences offshore and that the impact of wave drift on these calculations is most promising for further research. To investigate this impact, the problem is split into three parts: wave drift estimation for a <b>stationary</b> <b>vessel,</b> wave drift estimation for a sailing vessel and the analysis of the towing stability. From the literature, eleven methods are identified for the wave drift estimation of a <b>stationary</b> <b>vessel.</b> These are compared for the surge, sway and yaw force components. The different methods are computed using the diffraction program Delfrac, the strip theory solver ShipMo and own implementations in Matlab. With vessel velocities included, ten wave drift estimation methods for the sailing vessel are compared. Specific attention is paid to the wave drift damping, which relates the stationary wave drift to vessel velocities. It is implemented using Aranha's formulations and the panel pressure output of Delfrac. The most applicable methods with respect to the sailing tow resistance are the far field and near field methods in combination with the wave drift damping. With respect to the total tow resistance, the wave drift contribution is found to make up roughly 25 % of the total resistance, irrespective of forward velocity. The dynamic behaviour of the tow operation is examined for two barges: one course stable and one course unstable barge. Their towing stability properties are assessed without waves present and for head waves conditions. It is found that the head waves do not affect the stability of the course stable barge assuming the towing tug has sufficient available towing force. For the course unstable barge, the main stabilising effect is identified as the extra resistance due to the head waves and not the direct wave drift moment. The relative contribution of the waves with respect to the wind and current shows that the head waves have a significant stabilising contribution to the towing stability although the specific relative contributions are highly dependent on the environmental conditions. Head waves either reduce the path width of the fishtailing motion or dampen these oscillations into a stable towing position. This was verified by simulations in the time domain. Irregular waves also promote the stability: they stabilise the unstable barge in the entire range of physically relevant wave periods, irrespective of towline length. Overall, the contribution of the wave drift to the tow resistance is significant, especially while sailing. Head waves are beneficial for the towing stability of a course unstable barge, both in regular and irregular sea states. This increased insight reduces the uncertainty in the tow resistance prediction and contributes to the understanding of the towing stability properties of unstable barges...|$|E

Elementary sonar information is divided into five categories that comprise 24 survey and sonar parameters and 55 school, cluster and fisher behaviour descriptors. We review the applications of these categories and discuss perspectives for their use in fisheries science. If the sonar system enables the evaluation of the effects of vessel avoidance on fish school biomass assessment, no accurate abundance estimate can be provided by a simple sonar echo-integration process. Omnidirectional sonar data can be used to analyse collectively the fish schools' swimming speed, kinematics in terms of diffusion and migration, aggregative dynamics as school splitting and merging indexes, spatial characteristics of clusters such as school density, 2 D structure and fisher behaviour. The prospect of integrating such data into a fish school database, including multifrequency echo-sounder and lateral multibeam (3 D) sonar data combined with a species recognition method, will enable a complete view of fish school behaviour and consequently the adoption of accurate fisheries management methods...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{collective}} behaviour of Norwegian spring spawning herring (NSS-herring; Clupea harengus L.) in the specific ecological context of reproduction. The {{major part of the}} work is based on field research using quantitative echo sounders and sonar in combination with biological sampling. In addition, an individual based schooling model is applied to investigate underlying mechanisms of the collective formations and dynamics. All studies are founded in a classical mechanistic ecological approach interpreting behaviours as optimal evolutionary strategies given an individual’s physiological and cognitive constraints, internal state and the specific ecological context. Two of the works are case-studies from historical spawning grounds of NSSherring well-known to fishermen and scientists; the shallow (30 - 40 m) banks off Karmøy (Paper 1) receive a small proportion of the spawning stock, whereas deep (80 - 250 m) areas off Møre (Paper 2) comprise the main spawning grounds. In both works the areas are covered through repeated acoustic surveys in combination with sampling of herring and predators throughout the 24 -h-cycle over several days. Fisheries scientists apply similar acoustic surveying when making abundance estimates of herring that serve as basis for advices of catch quotas. A major challenge during such surveying is the fact that herring tend to avoid the approaching research vessel, rendering them unavailable to detection. How this potential source of error operates during spawning is given the focus in one of the works (Paper 3). In this study we use a simple experimental design where a standard research vessel passes a presumably neutral <b>stationary</b> <b>vessel</b> that records the herring reaction. In the fourth work we apply a rule-based simulation model with high temporal resolution able to recreate life-like collective behaviours (Paper 4). The model is used to explore how collective dynamics and formations are affected when varying the amount of herring present and their degree of motivational synchronisation. In the final work (Paper 5) we investigate 11 years of acoustic data from herring spawning surveys along the Norwegian coast. We frequently find evidence of vertical hourglass formations, and based on knowledge gained from previous studies and the simulation model we formulate and test out a concrete hypothesis; are these formations founded in conflicting individual motivation for spawning? An overall evaluation of our field results strongly supports that herring behaviour during spawning reflects a compromise between survival and reproduction. We find that herring spawn in highly synchronous waves where individuals aggregate (Paper 2) and move together (Paper 1) in their quest for a successful spawning. This strategy is likely to be advantageous for survival since a synchronous emergence in high numbers will decrease an individual’s risk of being targeted by a predator (dilution effect). A similar advantage is gained through spawning in the dark hours when predators are less active. Shoals at night-time were observed to have a stable loose packing density, whereas a variable, but generally high packing density at daytime corresponds well with a presumed higher frequency of predator attacks, since it is known that shoals become more densely packed under attack. At the deep spawning grounds, large proportions of the herring became scattered in pelagic layers at night-time. Interestingly, these layers were positioned according to the thermocline in a way that indicates active use of the vertical temperature profile to fine-tune maturation rate in the days prior to spawning. The shallow spawning grounds had a different dynamic and such layers were not observed. In these areas, the vast majority of herring were in layers at the bottom at night-time. In this situation, herring did not react to the research vessel (Paper 3), probably because the focus on the spawning activity increases their reaction threshold. At both spawning grounds (Papers 1 and 2), there were substantial vertical dynamics that corresponded well with the results from the schooling model. In the model simulations, shoal height is dependent on the difference in individual motivation for spawning. With strong conflicts in motivation, shoals tend to split {{in the same way as}} we observed during spawning in the field (Paper 2), whereas with intermediate conflicts shoals maintain cohesion but become vertically extended like we observed during pre-spawning. A special case of the latter is the vertical hourglass formation that emerges in the model assorted according to maturation state. Similar assortment was observed in the hourglass formations in the wild, where spawners dominated in the lower parts relative to pre- and post-spawners, strongly indicating that motivational conflict is the driving force of the observed formation. Whether such formations are purely emergent from decisions made from local stimuli or implying communication between the two shoal parts is an interesting question open to future investigations...|$|E
40|$|Wärtsilä ELAC Nautik is {{one major}} global {{player in the}} multibeam business. The multibeam systems are marketed under the {{well-known}} brand name SeaBeam, including systems for medium water depth and deep-water areas. The ELAC SeaBeam 3012 / 3020 deep-water systems operate in the 12 kHz and 20 kHz frequency bands, whereas the ELAC SeaBeam 3030 / 3050 medium-depth systems operate in the 30 kHz and 50 kHz frequency bands. While formerly only continuous wave (CW) pulses were applied, the new Mk II series of the ELAC SeaBeam 3030 / 3050 multibeam systems offer the possibility to apply frequencymodulated (FM) pulses for increased measurement ranges, improved range resolution and better data quality. FM pulses require a correlation of the beamformed data of all beam directions with pulse replica {{in order to obtain}} pulse compression. Additionally, Doppler shifts of the operating frequencies induced by the ship’s movement have to be compensated. In order to obtain unrivalled data quality, the ELAC SeaBeam 3030 / 3050 multibeam ystems apply Doppler compensation not only on the bathymetric depth data, but also on the water column imaging (WCI) data. In order to provide high data density, all ELAC SeaBeam MBES can transmit two quasisimultaneous swaths per ping cycle, which are frequency-separated. Compared to the singleping mode, the data density is doubled. The ELAC SeaBeam 3030 / 3050 multibeam systems include a functionality for to automatic cyclical steering of the transmitted swaths in the along-ship direction. Via this functionality, which is called “Advanced Transmission Beam Steering”, an entire volume below the vessel can be insonified without requiring any movement of the vessel. The operator can specify an angle range and an angle increment, resulting in a periodic oscillation of the transmitted swaths from bow to aft and vice versa. This functionality is very helpful for the detection and analysis of gas flares, leakages or other objects in the water column during <b>stationary</b> <b>vessel</b> operation or on fixed platforms.

However the optical fibers must been calibrated to know the uncertainty in temperature measure, and it is the purpose of the paper. system with a depth performance of more than 6, 000 meters. Wärtsilä ELAC Nautik is a main industrial partner within the German „Lighthouse“ Research Project SUGAR (Submarine Gas Hydrate Reservoirs) and cooperates with the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel. Wärtsilä ELAC Nautik participates in a SUGAR subproject, which is related to gas flare detection. Gas flares at the seabed are indicators for potential gas hydrate reservoirs and potential leakages of gas deposits. Therefore, gas flare detection is important for the exploration of submarine gas hydrates and for environmental monitoring. Driven by the SUGAR project, the ELAC SeaBeam multibeam systems store WCI data with very high resolution. For the online and offline visualization of high-resolution WCI data, the ELAC WCI Viewer is utilized, providing different window types for data visualization, different scaling and range options, forward and backward data playback as movies or single pictures, object and event functionalities and the display of external sensor data. These capabilities help to identify and analyze any kinds of objects in the water column or on the bottom (e. g. gas seeps). Despite helpful aids for the online visualization of high-resolution WCI data, there is a need for an automatic processing of WCI data with respect to object detection. Such automatic processing will reduce the workload of survey operators significantly. Therefore, Wärtsilä ELAC Nautik has developed an automatic object detector (ELAC AOD) which is dedicated to gas flares in the water column. Due to the huge data volumes of high-resolution WCI data, the development of the ELAC AOD was ambitious and challenging. The ELAC AOD was implemented within the MATLAB development environment. The ELAC AOD is dedicated to WCI data from ELAC SeaBeam 3030 and 3050 medium-depth multibeam systems and stores all relevant information of detected objects in so-called object log files. It is possible to import such object log files into the ELAC WCI Viewer for visualization purposes. Due to the above-mentioned characteristics, multibeam systems from Wärtsilä ELAC Nautik are excellently applicable in order to detect and analyze gas flares in the water column.

40|$|An Australian Government sanctioned swimming-with-whales (SWW) tourism {{industry}} has {{developed in the}} northern Great Barrier Reef based on the austral winter migration of dwarf minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata subsp.). Nine Reef tour operators were granted special SWW endorsements/permits in 2003 by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and the industry has remained capped at this level. Permit conditions require these operators to (i) comply with a Code of Practice when encountering the whales, and (ii) report details of all encounters using Whale Sighting Sheets. The cumulative impacts of this tourism activity are uncertain and there are widespread concerns about the sustainability of swim-with-cetaceans programs. The geographic remoteness of these interactions in the Great Barrier Reef poses additional challenges for monitoring the activity. Adopting a 'sustainability science' approach, this study utilised a mixed methodology to investigate mechanisms for assessing the sustainability of this SWW tourism activity. Four studies were conducted over three minke whale seasons (2006 - 2008), which investigated: (1) The spatial and temporal distribution of dwarf minke whale encounters and SWW tourism operators' effort in the Great Barrier Reef, (2) The social values of dwarf minke whales and the SWW experience, (3) Management of the SWW activity, and (4) The development of sustainability objectives and indicators for future monitoring of the SWW activity. Study One examined the distribution of minke whale encounters across the northern Great Barrier Reef (n= 854) and compared these with industry searching effort and site use in this region.

Numerical simulations are performed for both <b>stationary</b> and manoeuvring <b>vessels</b> to verify the feasibility and benefit of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} {{for measuring the}} radiated noise from a ship in shallow water, and deriving the source level spectrum. The method {{is applied to the}} measurement of dredgers in UK waters, vessels which are restricted to shallow water during aggregate extraction. Estimation of source level requires an estimate of the transmission loss which accounts for the effect of both the surface and seabed. The measurement method used involves the simultaneous measurement of the radiated noise at a number of measurement stations, each consisting of hydrophones which are either deployed from a <b>stationary</b> survey <b>vessel,</b> or from an autonomous recording buoy. The measurements at up to four ranges from the source vessel allow for empirical estimation of the source level using appropriate transmission loss models, with the data analysed in third-octave frequency bands. Measurement results presented are for trailing suction hopper dredgers, which lower a drag head and suction pipe to the sea floor to extract the sand or gravel, whilst returning unwanted material and water over the side [...] Noise levels are shown for the same dredger under different operational modes illustrating that, for these vessels, the noise output level is partially dependent upon the aggregate type being extracted...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{research}} into the effect of underwater noise on the communication between an under-ice Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and it’s <b>stationary</b> launch <b>vessel</b> (the Aurora Australis), fast multipole boundary element method (FMBEM) acoustic modeling was conducted. In particular, a steel damping plate with a complex 3 -dimensional structure was modeled (using up to 1. 6 x 10 5 boundary elements) {{and the effect of}} sound scattering from a pinger near the ship was determined at the receiver hydrophone, which was in close proximity to the damping plate. The direct incident field from the pinger was modeled as a plane wave at a number of incidence angles (to account for the depths to which the hydrophone was lowered) and over a range of frequencies up to the pinger frequency of 10 kHz. This paper presents these results and discusses some of the interesting effects observed at the ‘non-unique’ frequencies when using the different methods available to provide stability to the numerical solution. Thus far, the modeling conducted for the damping plate has treated the object as rigid. The FMBEM code being developed at CMST now has the capability to model fully coupled fluid-structure interactions and some initial results from treating the damping plate as elastic are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Intravascular large B-cell {{lymphoma}} (IVLBCL) is a cumbersome diagnosis {{to make in}} vivo, par-ticularly {{because of}} its elusive nature and ability to be a relatively nonspecific ‘great mimicker’. Although it frequently has skin manifestations, it often escapes diagnosis due to its angiotrophism and predilection for vessels {{that are difficult to}} biopsy (e. g., cerebral vasculature). IVLBCL can involve the vasculature of virtually any organ but typically spares the lymph nodes themselves, and likely due to defects in adhesion molecules, remains <b>stationary</b> in the <b>vessels.</b> Histologically, the malignant lymphocytes are large and mi-totically active with prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemically, the cells stain as B-cells. The disease has an overall poor prognosis. Here we present a case of IVLBCL diagnosed at autopsy that presented as a hemorrhagic frontal lobe infarct, which progressed to delirium...|$|R
50|$|Since the {{freshwater}} lakes {{are less}} corrosive to ships than the salt {{water of the}} oceans, many of the Lakers remain in service for long periods and the fleet has a much higher average age than the ocean-going fleet. The average lifespan of a laker is 40-50 years however, ships older than 50 years are not uncommon. Until 2014, , built in 1906 as William P. Snyder (552 ft), was the oldest ship in active duty on the Lakes. She was managed by Port City Steamship and owned by St. Mary's Cement, a subsidiary of Votorantim Cimentos. E. M. Ford {{had one of the}} longest careers, having been built in 1898 (as Presque Isle - 428 ft) and still sailing the lakes 98 years later in 1996. In 2007 she was still afloat as a <b>stationary</b> transfer <b>vessel</b> at a riverside cement silo in Saginaw. She went to the scrap yard in November 2010 at Purvis Marine. J. B. Ford, built in 1904, last sailed in 1985 and in 2007 served in the same capacity as E. M. Ford at a different cement silo in Superior, Wisconsin. Several decorated World War II veteran ships are still in active, although civilian, use such as the tankers Chiwawa and Neshanic, now the bulk freighters Lee A. Tregurtha and American Victory, respectively, and the Landing Craft Tank 203, now the working vessel Outer Island.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{no strong}} {{scientific}} {{data concerning the}} origins of pelagic plastics. In {{a study published in}} 2014, researchers sampled 1571 locations throughout the worlds oceans, and determined that discarded fishing gear such as buoys, lines, and nets accounted for more than 60% of the mass of plastic marine debris. According to a 2011 EPA report, [...] "The primary source of marine debris is the improper waste disposal or management of trash and manufacturing products, including plastics (e.g., littering, illegal dumping) ... Debris is generated on land at marinas, ports, rivers, harbors, docks, and storm drains. Debris is generated at sea from fishing <b>vessels,</b> <b>stationary</b> platforms and cargo ships." [...] Pollutants range in size from abandoned fishing nets to micro-pellets used in abrasive cleaners. Currents carry debris from the west coast of North America to the gyre in about six years, and debris from the east coast of Asia in a year or less.|$|R
40|$|As retinopathies {{continue}} to be major causes of visual loss and blindness worldwide, early detection and management of these diseases will help achieve significant reduction of blindness cases. However, an efficient automatic retinal vessel segmentation approach remains a challenge. Since efficient vessel network detection {{is a very important}} step needed in ophthalmology for reliable retinal vessel characterization, this paper presents study on the combination of difference image and K-means clustering for the segmentation of retinal <b>vessels.</b> <b>Stationary</b> points in the vessel center-lines are used to model the detection of twists in the vessel segments. The combination of arc-chord ratio with stationary points is used to compute tortuosity index. Experimental results show that the proposed K-means combined with difference image achieved a robust segmentation of retinal vessels. A maximum average accuracy of 0. 9556 and a maximum average sensitivity of 0. 7581 were achieved on DRIVE database while a maximum average accuracy of 0. 9509 and a maximum average sensitivity of 0. 7666 were achieved on STARE database. When compared with the previously proposed techniques on DRIVE and STARE databases, the proposed technique yields higher mean sensitivity and mean accuracy rates in the same range of very good specificity. In a related development, a non-normalized tortuosity index that combined distance metric and the vessel twist frequency proposed in this paper also achieved a strong correlation of 0. 80 with the expert ground truth...|$|R
40|$|Establishing a {{fine-grained}} {{model of}} local ocean currents is important since currents carry nutrients and other substances, which affect ecosystems in coastal regions. For example, researchers {{are interested in}} establishing current models for the Gulf of Maine (US) since they distribute {{a specific type of}} algae to shellfish off the coast of Maine during the warm summer months; the shellfish consuming the algae turn toxic for humans (’red tide’ phenomenon) [1]. Today, major ocean currents are established using coastal radar; however, the information is spatially and temporally too coarse. We are investigating the alternative deployment of a fleet of inexpensive ocean drifters which are passively propelled by the current and report their GPS-based location and trajectories to the end user. Today, large-scale sensing platforms such as <b>stationary</b> moorings, research <b>vessels,</b> costal radar (CODAR) or large gliders are state of the art in ocean monitoring. In the future, they will be combined with new technology developments such as small-scale, inexpensive drifters and/or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) such as gliders [2]. A drifter is a small computing platform the size of a basketball which floats on the ocean surface, usually equipped with a long underwater peddle which moves the sensor as the ocean current moves (instead of the wind). Sensor boards can be attached to detect phenomena such as oil spills or marine microorganisms [3]. In contrast to drifters, AUVs are self-propelled and determine their movement direction and travel speed in a...|$|R
