5|$|Abu Bakar {{made his}} inaugural <b>state</b> <b>visit</b> {{while he was}} still a Temenggong. He toured England in 1866 with Dato' Jaafar, and met with members of the English royalty, notably Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales, Prince Edward. The Queen conferred Abu Bakar with the Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI), which he valued highly. The trip {{reportedly}} gave both Abu Bakar and Dato' Jaafar lasting memories of England, and inspired Abu Bakar to develop Johor along British lines. Nine years later, Abu Bakar travelled to Calcutta to meet up with Prince Edward who was then spending his time in the city. The following year, Prince Edward conferred Abu Bakar the Prince of Wales's Gold medal. He made another trip to London in 1878, where he was invited to attend the State Ball at Buckingham Palace. Abu Bakar's palaces were modelled closely along British lines; when Prince George and Prince Albert Victor visited Johor in the 1880s, they had commented that the huge drawing room of Abu Bakar's palace closely resembled the state-rooms found at Windsor Castle. He was also an avid polo player, and had raced with the princes during their state visits to Johor. The Duke of Sutherland also praised Abu Bakar's hospitality during his <b>state</b> <b>visit</b> after he became Sultan, and had reportedly enjoyed the Malay cuisine which the Abu Bakar had served to him.|$|E
5000|$|Queen Elizabeth II is [...] "the most {{travelled}} {{head of state}} in the world," [...] having made 261 official overseas <b>visits</b> and 96 <b>state</b> <b>visits</b> to 116 countries {{by the time of}} her Diamond Jubilee in 2012. Although she is sovereign of each of the Commonwealth realms, in practice, she usually performs full <b>state</b> <b>visits</b> as Queen of the United Kingdom, while the relevant governor-general undertakes <b>state</b> <b>visits</b> for his or her respective country on the sovereign's behalf.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of aid on trade for twelve European {{countries}} and {{the effect of}} <b>state</b> <b>visits</b> on trade for four European countries. The theoretical foundation for the analysis is the gravity model of trade. The results show a robust statistically significant effect of aid on trade for France and in some of the robustness tests significant effects of aid on exports for Germany, Spain, United Kingdom and the twelve countries combined. No effects of <b>state</b> <b>visits</b> on trade are found. The causal relationships between aid and trade and <b>state</b> <b>visits</b> and trade are investigated with Granger causality tests. The causality between aid and trade goes in different ways dependent on whether the twelve countries are tested together or individually. No causality is found between <b>state</b> <b>visits</b> and trade...|$|R

The ship was again placed in reserve from 1927 until 1933. Her sister became a gunnery training ship in 1928, after having been in reserve since 1926. Conte di Cavour was reconstructed at the CRDA Trieste Yard while Giulio Cesare was rebuilt at Cantieri del Tirreno, Genoa between 1933 and 1937. Both ships participated in a naval review by Adolf Hitler in the Bay of Naples in May 1938 and covered the invasion of Albania in May 1939.|$|E

Her keel was laid down on 30 November 1911 and she was launched on 7 November 1912. She was commissioned as part of the Bastille Day celebrations in 1914. Almost immediately after being commissioned, she, escorted by Jean Bart, carried the President of the French Republic, Raymond Poincaré, on a <b>state</b> <b>visit</b> to Saint Petersburg, Russia in July 1914. They returned from Russia shortly before World War I began.|$|E

Alexander had been made Sovereign Prince of Bulgaria in 1879 {{with the approval of}} Europe's Great Powers. Louis accompanied his brother on a <b>state</b> <b>visit</b> to Turkey, and then on a tour of Cyprus and the Holy Land with the Turkish navy, during which Louis was appalled at the lack of seamanship—the Turkish captains were unable to navigate and had to hug the coast so as not to get lost; when they did leave the coast they became so disoriented that they were unable to steer for Jaffa. On its return journey the ship on which they had travelled ran aground.|$|E

The visit was designed to bolster Anglo-French solidarity in the face of aggression from Nazi Germany. The French press praised the demeanour and charm of the royal couple during the delayed but successful visit, augmented by Hartnell's wardrobe.|$|E

5000|$|<b>State</b> <b>visits</b> are {{visits to}} the United States led by a foreign head of state acting {{in his or her}} {{sovereign}} capacity. They are, therefore, described as a [...] "visit of of state". [...] <b>State</b> <b>visits</b> can only occur on the invitation {{of the president of the}} United States, acting in his capacity as head of the United <b>States.</b> Official <b>visits,</b> in contrast, are usually visits by the chief of government of a foreign <b>state.</b> Like <b>state</b> <b>visits,</b> they can only occur on the invitation of the president of the United States, though are offered in the president's capacity as chief of the federal government of the United <b>States.</b> The <b>visit</b> of a crown prince may also be classified as an official <b>visit.</b> Both <b>state</b> and official <b>visits</b> generally consist of a four-day stay in Washington by the visitor, during which a range of welcoming ceremonies are performed. They are often followed by a tour.|$|R

She was completed on 19 November 1913 and finished her trials before World War I began the following year. Jean Bart escorted France, which was carrying the President of the French Republic, Raymond Poincaré, on a <b>state</b> <b>visit</b> to Saint Petersburg, Russia in July 1914. They were returning from Russia when World War I began, but made it to France without encountering German ships.|$|E
5|$|John then {{travelled}} to France for diplomatic negotiations, {{before returning}} to England. Gaveston was exiled by the Ordainers but later made an irregular return. Gaveston was killed in June 1312 by Thomas of Lancaster and other nobles. It fell upon John, together with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, to reconcile the two parties after this event. In 1313 he followed Edward II on a <b>state</b> <b>visit</b> to France, and thereafter generally remained a trusted subject. In 1318 he witnessed the Treaty of Leake, which restored Edward to full power.|$|E
5|$|Kaiser and Deutschland {{were placed}} in reserve after the 1878 {{maneuvers}} were cancelled and remained there for a decade, {{with the exception of}} the 1883 maneuvers. During the maneuvers, both ships' steam engines proved troublesome, and indeed forced a temporary halt to the training exercises when they simultaneously broke down. The two ships were reactivated in 1889 to participate in cruises following the coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm II. These included a <b>state</b> <b>visit</b> to Great Britain in August 1889 and a tour of the Mediterranean in the winter of 1889–1890.|$|E
