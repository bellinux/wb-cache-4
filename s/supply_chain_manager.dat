40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{investigate}} if, and to what degree, social media are used for the recruitment of global <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers.</b> Design/methodology/approach - This is a conceptual paper that discusses how organizations should engage with social media platforms for effective recruitment of global <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers.</b> Findings - Findings are that organizations seeking to employ global <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers,</b> particularly those engaged in B 2 B activities, lag other industry sectors in adopting new ways of recruiting talent. Building on the findings, we present models of how organizations should move to adopt web-based technologies and the steps needed to engage fully in using social media to recruit global <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers.</b> Research limitations/implications - Global <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> (including logistics) lag other industry sectors in adopting social media networks for recruitment, and risk missing out on talent if the issues are not addressed. Serious consideration needs to be given, particularly by B 2 B but also by B 2 C businesses, {{in order to attract}} suitable employees.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{organizations}} to effectively {{compete in the}} global marketplace is contingent on identifying and selecting an adequate number of qualified global managers. Nowhere is the shortage of managerial talent more evident than in the management of global <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> The complex and vexing set of problems facing global <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers</b> makes the task of selecting an adequate supply of managers much more daunting.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the state of the art of {{complexity}} management in the area of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management. In this regard, the suitability of Complex Adaptive System (CAS) modeling for making complexity-optimizing <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> decisions is discussed on the example of the semiconductor <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> New global markets, lower manufacturing costs, and sourcing activities have led to a global dispersion of <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> However, manufacturers have discovered an unpleasant side effect of global manufacturing: Rising complexity. In practice, <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers</b> react intuitively to the complexity of processes, products and IT. This is partly due to the fact that so far, only little effort has been made to develop tools for quantifying <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> complexity. But <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers</b> are in need of these methods enabling them to make complexity-optimized <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> decisions. The quantitative impact of complexity –its value and its costs– has to be effectively calculated to enable <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers</b> to make complexity-optimized <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> decisions. A promising approach for managing <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> complexity is the interpretation of a <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> as a complex adaptive system (CAS). CAS are systems far from equilibrium, characterized by a large number of interacting and evolving agents, who adapt and learn and thus could be able to solve the complexity dilemma...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to identify the relevant skills and their relative importance, required by <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers,</b> and to suggest the key skill items that require improvement. Design/methodology/approach - Using a survey questionnaire, data were collected against forty one <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management skills. Using expert opinion these skill items were then grouped to create four higher level <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> skill-categories. These are <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> general management (SCG) skill-category, <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> analytical (SCA) skill-category, <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> information technology (SCIT) skill-category, and <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> environmental-related (SCE) skill-category. Subsequently, the importance-performance matrix (IPM) analysis was conducted to these higher level skill-categories to assess {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the offered skills as perceived by the respondents. Findings - The analysis reveled that in order to prepare <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers</b> to face up to the future challenges educational institutions are required to devote their attention on areas such as warehousing management, distribution planning, demand forecasting, negotiation skill, cross-functional coordination skill, and knowledge of environmental issues in <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> Originality/value - This research provided insight into skills need for <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers</b> using importance-performance matrix (IPM) analysis.

40|$|The {{acquisition}} of knowledge either by organisations or individuals is considered {{critical to the}} success of the organisation in a dynamic and uncertain business environment.

More specifically, using an agency theory perspective, we examine the effect of incentive pay and the motivation scheme applied to <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers</b> on a firm’s <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> performance. We argue that the design of compensation contracts for <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers</b> needs to take into consideration the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> context in which the company operates.

50|$|A global <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>manager</b> {{needs to}} {{recognize}} that supplier performance is a crucial component of their business' success. A manager must recognize all the key components to building and maintaining a successful relationship which are: trust, communication, human asset specificity, and personal relationships. Trust {{is the basis of}} all business-supplier relationships and must be built over time. In order for the business and it's supplier to run successfully, there must be a mutual trust as success is dependent on both the business and the supplier. Communication is also a critical success factor. The flow of information between business and supplier is key in building a relationship and being successful. Businesses who implement the human asset specificity between themselves and their supplier have the benefits of higher levels of trust, better cost, quality and delivery performance. The human asset specificity is the communication and interaction of specific human assets within the business and the supplier. This means opening up communication between individuals in both the business and supplier who are link minded (e.g. engineer to engineer)7.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} and detail practices that are commonly used to pursue short-term functional targets (e. g. end of month sales targets) at the expense of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> integration. It also aims to identify the key questions that financial analysts should be asking companies to ensure that they are not using those practices and thereby destroying shareholder value. Design/methodology/approach: The insights were gained from the authors' hands-on <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> management experience and validated in discussions with <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> executives across a range of industrial sectors (including electronics, consumer packaged goods and logistics service providers). Findings: The paper identifies three sales and customer service practices, and two financial practices that undermine the performance of the integrated <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> In response it suggests alternative practices and four key questions that financial analysts should ask companies to ensure that the performance of the integrated <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> is not sabotaged – thereby helping <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers.</b> Practical implications: The paper can help <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> <b>managers</b> dispose of value-destructive behaviour in their organizations by offering them screens/descriptions of poor practice which they can hold up to their peers as a mirror.
