5|$|South Wales miners, {{including}} those at Universal, were paid on a rate {{determined by the}} <b>Sliding</b> <b>Scale</b> Committee, which fixed wages on the price coal fetched at market. When the price of coal slumped in the late 1890s, low wages led to industrial unrest and, in 1898, a strike that the men at Universal joined {{at the end of}} April. The Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners' Association refused to replace the scale, and the strike ended on 1 September with some small concessions granted by the owners. The colliery resumed production and in 1899 was producing 3,000 long tons (3,400short tons) of coal a week.|$|E
40|$|Though {{almost no}} postwar union {{contracts}} indexed wage rates to {{prices of the}} employer's products, union agreements linking wage rates to product prices, known as <b>sliding</b> <b>scales,</b> were common in some industries in the United States and Britain from the 1860 s through the 1930 s. This paper explains why <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> disappeared after the 1930 s, and examines what practical experience with <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> revealed about fundamental constraints on wage indexation. Paradoxically, the history of <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> confirms that workers' information about product prices and materials costs is generally imperfect, {{in ways that would}} substantially constrain wage indexation in long-term contracts. <b>Sliding</b> <b>scales</b> were not indexed long-term contracts, but rather devices to forestall costly strikes in the absence of contracts by revealing employers' private information about product demand. In the postwar US, unions and employers failed to link wage rates to product prices because they had gained the ability to enter binding contracts, which could achieve the benefits of preventing strikes without incurring the extra negotiation costs and information problems associated with product-price indexation. I present a model to show how <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> could forestall strikes by revealing information, and how the introduction of binding union contracts reduced incentives to link wages to product prices.

40|$|Sliding scales- {{agreements}} between employers and unions that linked wage rates to product prices- were widespread in some industries, and tried in others, in Britain and the United States from the 1860 s through the 1930 s. I describe how <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> worked {{in practice and}} how they were viewed by contemporary employers, unionists and outside observers. I argue that <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> were not adopted for the reasons suggested by most theories of wage indexation, but rather {{in order to reduce the}} frequency of strikes in an institutional setting where there was no third-party enforcement of labor agreements. This can explain both the presence of <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, and the disappearance of <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> since the 1930 s. - 1 -Sometime before the year 1841, a British ironmaster named G. B. Thorneycroft decided that the wages of his puddlers "should fluctuate with the price of 'marked bars '- these words indicating a quality of iron that then enjoyed a high reputation [...] . The puddlers received, as a rule, 1 shilling for each pound of the selling price " (Munro, 1889, p. 141). By the 1880 's, arrangements linking wages to product prices were generally referred to as "sliding scales. " In Britain, they had become standard practice for skilled iron and steel workers (Munro, 1885) and common in coalmining, where wages of about 120, 000 men were linked to coal prices (Munro, 1885, 1889).

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the areas surrounding the bridge becoming prosperous suburbs, tolls were set at relatively high rates on a <b>sliding</b> <b>scale,</b> ranging from a penny for pedestrians to 2s6d for vehicles drawn by six horses. Exemptions were granted for mail coaches, soldiers on duty and parliamentary candidates during election campaigns. However, {{the area around the}} bridge failed to develop as expected. In 1815 John Doulton built the Doulton & Watts (later Royal Doulton) stoneware factory at Vauxhall, and consequently instead of the wealthy residents anticipated by the company, the area began to fill with narrow streets of working class tenements to house the factory's workers. Meanwhile, the large Millbank Penitentiary was built near the northern end of the bridge, discouraging housing development. Consequently, toll revenues were initially lower than expected, and the dividends paid to investors were low.|$|E

5|$|Just before Edward's death, Parliament {{introduced}} {{a new form of}} taxation called the poll tax, which was levied at the rate of four pence on every person over the age of 14, with a deduction for married couples. Designed to spread the cost of the war over a broader economic base than previous tax levies, this round of taxation proved extremely unpopular but raised £22,000. The war continued to go badly and, despite raising some money through forced loans, the Crown returned to Parliament in 1379 to request further funds. The Commons were supportive of the young King, but had concerns about the amounts of money being sought and the way this was being spent by the King's counsellors, whom they suspected of corruption. A second poll tax was approved, this time with a <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> of taxes against seven different classes of English society, with the upper classes paying more in absolute terms. Widespread evasion proved to be a problem, and the tax only raised £18,600— far short of the £50,000 that had been hoped for.|$|E
40|$|There {{were many}} {{employment}} agreements linking wage rates to product prices, known as <b>sliding</b> <b>scales,</b> in Britain and the United States from the 1860 s through the 1930 s.

This paper explains why <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> disappeared after the 1930 s, and examines what historical experiments with <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> reveal about the fundamental constraints on wage indexation. - 1 - 1 Very rare exceptions include union contracts with the Magma Copper Company, which linked hourly wages to copper prices, along with the CPI, through 1992 (Charlier 1991, 1992), and 1990 s union contracts with Inco, a Canadian nickel producer, which linked wages to the spot price of nickel (Bagnell, 1997). Many theoretical models of long-term labor contracts (for example Blanchard, 1979; Hall and Lazear, 1984; Card, 1986; Oswald, 1986) imply that workers with bargaining power over an employer have incentives to index their wages to prices of the employers products, or to produc...|$|R
