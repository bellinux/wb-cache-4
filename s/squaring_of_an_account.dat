40|$|The {{exterior}} <b>square</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> multiset is {{a natural}} combinatorial construction which {{is related to the}} exterior <b>square</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vector space. We consider multisets <b>of</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>an</b> abelian group. Two properties are dened which a multiset may satisfy: recognisability and involution-recognisability. A constructive polynomialtime algorithm is developed which can determine whether a given multiset is equal to the exterior <b>square</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recognisable or involution-recognisable multiset. The proportion of multisets which are neither recognisable nor involution-recognisable is shown to be small when the abelian group is nite but large. Some further comments are made about the motivating case of multisets of eigenvalues of matrices. 1 Introduction The exterior <b>square</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vector space is a well known and important construction with applications in various areas of mathematics.

40|$|In 1962, Pósa conjectured that a graph G=(V, E) {{contains}} <b>a</b> <b>square</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Hamiltonian cycle if δ(G) > 2 n/ 3. Only {{more than}} thirty years later Komlós, Sárkőzy, and Szemerédi proved this conjecture using the so-called Blow-Up Lemma. Here we extend their result to a random graph setting. We show that for every ϵ > 0 and p=n^- 1 / 2 +ϵ a. a. s. every subgraph of G_n,p with minimum degree at least (2 / 3 +ϵ) np contains the <b>square</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cycle on (1 -o(1)) n vertices. This is almost best possible in three ways: (1) for p≪ n^- 1 / 2 the random graph will not contain any <b>square</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long cycle (2) one cannot hope for a resilience version for the <b>square</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spanning cycle (as deleting all edges in the neighborhood of single vertex destroys this property) and (3) for c< 2 / 3 a. a. s.
