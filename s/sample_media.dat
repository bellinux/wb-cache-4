40|$|Abstract Different <b>sampling</b> <b>media</b> (moss, lichen and attic dust) {{were used}} for {{monitoring}} the distribution of 15 elements, including certain trace elements, {{in the vicinity of}} an intensively exploited copper mine in the east of the Republic of Macedonia. Moss species (Hypnum cupressiforme and Campothecium lutescens), epiphytic lichens (Hypogymnia physodes and Evernia prunastri) and attic dust were collected for comparative analysis for monitoring air pollution. In both cases (lithological and anthropogenic affected areas) for the distribution of elements, the <b>sampling</b> <b>media</b> follows the expression capabilities: attic dust > moss > lichens. Enrichment factors M/L—moss vs. lichen, for plant response to elements distribution and D/L—attic dust vs. lichen, for historical response of elements distribution were significant for Cu and Ni, which were singled out as the main markers for anthropogenic and geogenic distribution. The factor analysis highlighted geogenic (F 1 : Ni-Cr-Cd-Fe-Al-K-Mn-Zn) and anthropogenic (F 2 : As-Cu-Pb) association of elements from three types of <b>media</b> <b>samples.</b> For anthropogenic affected areas, T value and F value for Cu content were significant at p < 0. 05 and higher enrichment factors were obtained for lichen, moss and attic dust media (3. 8, 5. 0 and 5. 7, respectively). Spatial distribution for element deposition (with emphasis on Cu and Ni) is not disturbed by the significant differences in the <b>sampling</b> <b>media</b> matrix. Treated <b>sample</b> materials (attic dust, moss, lichen) are shown to be useful in determining an anthropogenic impact, as well as the chemical properties or geological background on orographic diverse terrain in the presence of complex geological structure...|$|R

40|$|Rare earth {{elements}} (REEs) {{are quickly}} gaining {{more and more}} relevance as important chemical resources due to {{the large number of}} technical applications, and as a consequence, scientific interest on REE-bearing minerals is increasing. In this work, REE data from the FOREGS Geochemical Atlas of Europe database on solid <b>sample</b> <b>media</b> (topsoil, subsoil, stream sediment, and floodplain) and stream water for Italy and Sweden are used to plot distribution maps, and Principal Component Analysis to identify patterns within the data set. The careful investigation of the spatial distribution of REEs in all <b>sample</b> <b>media</b> for both countries allowed us to identify the prominent role played by the geogenic component. Despite a similar REE content of bedrocks (alkaline igneous products, both intrusive and effusive in Italy, alkali granites and pegmatites in Sweden), several distinct differences emerged between the two countries. We identified factors like climate, geomorphology, age of deposits, presence of mineralisation, types of soil and presence of till, as responsible for the different REE enrichments in solid and aqueous <b>sample</b> <b>media</b> in the two countries. Italian palaeosols, developed in volcanic areas, were identified as a possible future source for REE extraction using low pollutant extraction techniques...|$|E

40|$|In most {{water quality}} {{monitoring}} programs, either filtered water (dissolved) or suspended sediment (either whole water or separated suspended sediment) are the traditional <b>sample</b> <b>media</b> of choice. This results both from regulatory requirements {{and a desire}} to maintain consistency with long-standing data collection procedures. Despite the fact that both bed sediments and/or flood plain deposits have been used to identify substantial water quality issues, they rarely are used in traditional water quality monitoring programs. The usual rationale is that bed sediment chemistry does not provide the temporal immediacy that can be obtained using more traditional <b>sample</b> <b>media</b> (e. g., suspended sediment, water). However, despite the issue of temporal immediacy, bed sediments can be used to address/identify certain types of water quality problems and could be employed more frequently for that purpose. Examples where bed sediments could be used include: (1)  identifying potential long-term monitoring sites/water quality hot spots, (2)  establishing a water quality/geochemical history for a particular site/area, and (3)  as a surrogate for establishing mean/median chemical values for suspended sediment...|$|E
