25|$|Shells are carved {{soon after}} the tree is felled, while the wood still retains some {{moisture}} and is softer. This makes the wood easier to carve and avoids radial splits that tend to develop in logs that are allowed to dry naturally. Carvers use simple hand tools, such as axes, adzes, <b>spoke</b> <b>shaves,</b> and rasps to shape the shell. A well-carved djembe {{does not have a}} smooth interior but a texture of scallops or shallow grooves that influence the sound of the instrument. (Djembes with smooth interiors have tones and slaps with too much sustain.) Often, interior grooves form a spiral pattern, which indicates a carver taking pride in his work.|$|R
