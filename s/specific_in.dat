5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very <b>specific</b> <b>in</b> their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{and context}} in infants’ {{linguistic}} environment shape their vocabulary development. English learners {{have been found}} to map novel labels to objects more reliably than to actions compared to Mandarin learners. This early noun bias in English learners is caused by the culturally reinforced tendency for English speaking caregivers to engage in a significant amount of ostensive labelling as well as noun-friendly activities such as picture book reading. Adult speech provides children with grammatical input. Both Mandarin and Cantonese languages have a category of grammatical function word called a noun classifier, which is also common across many genetically unrelated East Asian languages. In Cantonese, classifiers are obligatory and <b>specific</b> <b>in</b> more situations than in Mandarin. This accounts for the research found on Mandarin-speaking children outperforming Cantonese-speaking children in relation to the size of their vocabulary.|$|E

However, he was persuaded by an envoy of the Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau, sister of the Prince of Orange, to go instead to The Hague and to present the {{children}} to her, as official guests of the court. After the party's landing at Calais there was a month's delay at Lille, as first Wolfgang fell sick with tonsillitis, then Leopold suffered prolonged dizziness attacks. Early in September the family moved on to Ghent, where Wolfgang played on the new organ at the Bernardines chapel; {{a few days later}} he played on the cathedral organ at Antwerp. On 11 September the family finally reached The Hague.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{symptoms}} of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not <b>specific.</b> <b>In</b> many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site {{by the time they}} have symptoms and seek medical attention. Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches, fainting, convulsions, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, adrenal glands, opposite lung, liver, pericardium, and kidneys. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.|$|E

The large blue butterfly is much more <b>specific</b> <b>in</b> its requirements; it is found only in chalk grassland areas, its larvae feed on Thymus species and because of complex lifecycle requirements it inhabits only areas in which Myrmica ants live.|$|E

Other Dacian nobles, however, were either captured or chose to surrender. One of those who surrendered revealed the location of the Dacian royal treasury, which was of enormous value: 500,000 pounds (226,800 kilograms) of gold and 1,000,000 pounds (453,600 kilograms) of silver.|$|E

25|$|Jung's staunchest {{critics have}} {{accused him of}} either mystical or metaphysical essentialism.

Hence they elude systematic study. Jung and his supporters defended the impossibility of providing rigorous operationalised definitions as a problem peculiar not only to archetypal psychology alone, but also other domains of knowledge that seek to understand complex systems in an integrated manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{species in}} this {{subfamily}} are all mycoheterotrophic, relying on fungal hosts for their carbon nutrition. The fungi parasitized by these plants are ectomycorrhizal species of fungi. Hence, these plants act as direct parasites of these fungi, and also indirectly, {{act as an}} epiparasite of conifers and the larger shared mycorrhizal network. Monotropoideae species can generally be described as full, obligate mycoheterotrophs, though if the Pyroleae are treated {{as part of the}} Monotropoideae, include partially mycoheterotrophic (mixtotrophic) members as well. The parasitism by these plants is generally very <b>specific</b> <b>in</b> terms of its fungal hosts, ranging from single families of fungi, to a few closely related species.|$|E
25|$|To be more <b>specific,</b> <b>in</b> {{order for}} an {{electron}} {{in the outer}} orbital of a molecule to jump from a ground-state orbital to an excited state orbital, it requires a fixed amount of energy, which, {{in the case of}} chromophores (molecules that absorb light), can be acquired by absorbing a photon with an energy equal or slightly higher. This state is short-lived, and the electron returns to the ground-level orbital, losing the energy either as heat {{or in the case of}} fluorophores by emitting a photon, which, due to the loss of the difference between the energy of the absorbed photon and the excitation energy required, will have a lower energy than the absorbed photon, or, expressed in terms of wavelength, the emitted photon will have a longer wavelength. The difference between the two wavelengths is called Stokes’ shift.|$|E

25|$|The {{method of}} {{recombination}} detailed above is advantageous as {{it provides an}} alternative to the low-efficiency, laborious, and multi-step recombination processes using endonucleases and ligases. Therefore, λ-red recombination is more <b>specific</b> <b>in</b> terms of possible genomic alterations that are not governed by locations of restriction enzyme recognition sites. However, it also has many limitations. Multiple rounds of transformations can increase the risk of error and increase recombination time. Therefore, efficiency can be low (0.1–10% for point mutations; 10−5–10−6 for insertions, deletions, or replacements) and requires long growth into workable colonies between transformations and recombinant selections. All together, this contributes to a lengthy and inefficient mutagenesis procedure for even single mutations. This technique can also leave scars that can contribute to destabilization of the chromosome and impact the success of the manipulation.|$|E
25|$|Sugar-free gum {{sweetened}} with xylitol {{has been}} shown to reduce cavities and plaque. The sweetener sorbitol has the same benefit, but is only about one-third as effective as xylitol. Other sugar substitutes, such as maltitol, aspartame and acesulfame K, have also been found to not cause tooth decay. Xylitol is <b>specific</b> <b>in</b> its inhibition of Streptococcus mutans, bacteria that are significant contributors to tooth decay. Xylitol inhibits Streptococcus mutans in the presence of other sugars, with the exception of fructose. Xylitol is a safe sweetener that benefits teeth and saliva production because, unlike most sugars, it is not fermented to acid. Daily doses of xylitol below 3.44grams are ineffective and doses above 10.32grams show no additional benefit. Other active ingredients in chewing gum include fluoride, which strengthens tooth enamel, and p-chlorbenzyl-4-methylbenzylpiperazine, which prevents travel sickness. Chewing gum also increases saliva production.|$|E
25|$|Committed to the project, Layton {{set out on}} his voyage {{across the}} Atlantic and hired George Ashdown Audsley, a Liverpool {{architect}} to design the gallery building. A local Milwaukee firm led by Edward Townsend Mix worked jointly with the British architect {{to carry out the}} construction. Layton was <b>specific</b> <b>in</b> his vision of the gallery and asked of Audsley: “Can we not have a building one story over a basement, about 80x100 feet, in the center of our ground that will look well?” The resulting design was a single-story top-lit gallery that differed from other American gallery designs of the period. Authors John C. Eastberg and Eric Vogel observe in their book, Layton’s Legacy, that the gallery design was directly inspired by the art galleries of Great Britain and compare the Layton Art Gallery’s floor plan, façade and elevations with institutions such as the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, the Dulwich Picture Gallery of Greater London and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.|$|E
