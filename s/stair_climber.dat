40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} portrayed others on stair climbing in a train station. On each of five observation days, we observed stair climbing behavior during six periods: a no-intervention period and five intervention periods to promote stair climbing. During the no-intervention period, no prompts or environmental changes were introduced. During one intervention period, we showed a health message at the point-of-choice. During the other four intervention periods, we portrayed the same health message together with one of four life-sized models varying in gender and age: a young male model, a young female model, an older male model and an older female model. Fifteen hundred passersby were observed. Chi-square tests revealed that introducing a health message did not yield a significantly higher proportion of <b>stair</b> <b>climbers</b> compared with the no-intervention period, {{even though there was}} a positive trend (21. 7 % vs. 15. 0 %). However, adding a portrayed model resulted in a significantly higher proportion of <b>stair</b> <b>climbers</b> compared with the no-intervention period (25. 9 % vs. 15. 0 %). In general, the proportion of <b>stair</b> <b>climbers</b> was significantly higher among passersby who matched with the model in terms of their gender and age than among passersby who did not match with the model (37. 2 % vs. 21. 5 %). These findings demonstrate that adding a portrayed model to a health message positively affects stair climbing in a public setting.

40|$|PURPOSE: Evaluating {{the impact}} of {{footprints}} on stair climbing in different settings. DESIGN: Interrupted time-series design. SETTING: A company (stair/elevator choice) and a mall (stair/escalator choice). SUBJECTS: Employees (n= 5, 676) and visitors of the mall (n= 12, 623). INTERVENTION: An intervention comprising three consecutive phases was implemented: (1) footprints leading to the stairs were stuck on the floor, (2) a health message referring to the footprints was introduced, and (3) passers-by were congratulated for their increased stair use. MEASURES: Stair climbing was observed before (i. e. baseline), during and six to thirteen weeks after (i. e. follow-up) the intervention. ANALYSIS: Proportions of <b>stair</b> <b>climbers</b> were compared using Ï‡Â²-analyses. RESULTS: The footprints resulted in a closely-significant increase in stair climbing in the company (from 27. 7 % at baseline to 31. 2 % in phase 1). However, they did not produce any effect in the mall. Introducing a health message yielded an additional 12. 4 % increase in stair climbing in the company and a significant 11. 4 % increase in the mall (22. 3 % in phase 2). Congratulating people did not further increase stair climbing. At follow-up, the proportions of <b>stair</b> <b>climbers</b> dropped but still exceeded baseline. CONCLUSION: Footprints tend to increase stair climbing in a worksite setting with a stair/escalator choice, {{but not in a}} public setting with a stair/elevator choice. Adding a meaningful message seems essential to obtain stronger and longer-term effects. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} closed access. It was {{published}} in the serial, British Journal of Health Psychology [Wiley Â© The British Psychological Society]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] We investigated whether individuals mimic the stair/escalator choices of preceding pedestrians. Our methodology sought to separate cases where the â€˜modelâ€™ and â€˜followerâ€™ were acquaintances or strangers. Design. Natural experiment. Methods. Infrared monitors provided a second-by-second log of when pedestrians ascended adjacent stairs/escalators in a mall. Manual timings established that stair climbers spent â‰¥ 7 s on ascent, during which time they could act as models to following pedestrians. Thus, individuals who mounted the stairs/escalator â‰¤ 7 s after the previous <b>stair</b> <b>climber</b> were assigned to a â€˜stair modelâ€™ condition. A â€˜no stair modelâ€™ condition comprised individuals with a gap to the previous <b>stair</b> <b>climber</b> of â‰¥ 60 s. The stair model condition was subdivided, depending if the gap between model and follower was 1 â€“ 2 s or 3 â€“ 7 s. It was hypothesized that the former cohort may know the model. Results. Percentage stair climbing was significantly higher in the â€˜stair modelâ€™ versus â€˜no stair modelâ€™ condition (odds ratio [OR]= 2. 08). Subgroup analyses showed greater effects in the â€˜ 1 â€“ 2 sâ€™ cohort (OR = 3. 33) than the â€˜ 3 â€“ 7 sâ€™ cohort (OR = 1. 39). Conclusions. Individuals appear to mimic the stair/escalator choices of fellow pedestrians, with more modest effects between strangers. People exposed to message prompts at stair/escalator sites are known to take the stairs unprompted in subsequent situations. Our results suggest that these individuals could recruit a second generation of stair climbers via mimicry. Additionally, some of the immediate behavioural effects observed in interventions may be a product of mimicry, rather than a direct effect of the messages themselves...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”The haptic sense {{provides}} continuous information during physical human-machine interaction. Humans {{can respond}} {{very quickly and}} effectively to such feedback, such as a driver making rapid steering adjustments when his vehicle hits a pothole.

Subjects were instructed to step on a modified <b>stair</b> <b>climber</b> at a consistent workout pace while simultaneously completing a mental distraction task. They were provided with one of five different haptic communications to assist in maintaining their workout intensity level. Results show that haptic communications helped subjects step as much as 1. 7 % faster with as much as 3. 95 % more power output than without the haptic communications, although none of the communications beneficially affected velocity or power standard deviations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{health and}} fitness {{benefits}} associated with short, intermittent bouts of exercise accumulated throughout the day have been seldom investigated. Stair climbing provides an ideal model for this purpose. METHODS: Twenty-two healthy female volunteers (18 - 22 years) {{were randomly assigned to}} control (N = 10) or stair-climbing (N = 12) groups. <b>Stair</b> <b>climbers</b> then underwent a 7 -week stair-climbing program, progressing from one ascent per day in week 1 to six ascents per day in weeks 6 and 7, using a public access staircase (199 steps). Controls were instructed to maintain their normal lifestyle. Standardized stair-climbing tests were administered to both groups immediately before and after the program. Each paced ascent lasted 135 s, during which oxygen uptake (VO(2)) and heart rate (HR) were monitored continuously. Blood lactate concentration was also measured immediately following each test ascent. Fasting blood samples from before and after the program were analyzed for serum lipids. Data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures. RESULTS: Relative to the insignificant changes in the control group, the stair-climbing group displayed a rise in HDL cholesterol concentration (P< 0. 05) and a reduced total:HDL ratio (P< 0. 01) {{over the course of the}} program. VO(2) and HR during the stair-climbing test were also reduced, as was blood lactate (all P< 0. 01).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. It is commonly accepted that ambulance staff undertake {{a large amount of}} lifting and handling in their daily work. Their primary role is to provide pre-hospital care and to transport sick and injured people to hospital. The emergency nature of the job means that ambulance workers have to assist people who are incapable of moving themselves in awkward and potentially hazardous environments. While safer lifting policies have been introduced ambulance workers still lift weights which other healthcare workers can avoid. However since the introduction of manual handling regulations and more recently CEN standards, ambulance services and manufacturers have been trying to find new ways of moving and transferring patients. Ambulance services have purchased new equipment to reduce musculoskeletal risks but there is little scientific evidence to support their purchasing choices. This thesis presents two case studies describing ergonomic equipment evaluations of stretcher loading systems and mobility equipment to provide a scientific basis to support purchasing decisions. Case study one is a comparative analysis of stretcher loading equipment used in UK ambulance services. The study was carried out in two phases. Phase 1 was a field study which used observation and interview methods to identify issues affecting equipment use in a range of environments. Phase 2 was a simulation study which used task simulation to assess the postures adopted during loading and unloading activities with each system. Both phases identified the tail lift as the preferred system to reduce manual handling and improve patient and operator safety. Case study two is a comparative evaluation of mobility equipment. User trials were carried out to evaluate 12 transport chairs and 4 stretchers for Accident and Emergency and Patient Transport Service staff to identify preferred equipment for each team. 16 staff assessed the equipment by conducting task simulations and completing questionnaires for each product. Postures adopted during the tasks were assessed using Rapid Entire Body Assessment. The mechanised <b>stair</b> <b>climber</b> chair was the preferred chair for both teams. The stretcher analysis was inconclusive. This thesis has used two case studies to establish a protocol for field and lab based evaluations of movement and transfer equipment in the future for the ambulance vehicle. A more comprehensive procurement process is recommended to include detailed ergonomic evaluation, ensuring that the end user is fully represented. The thesis concludes that automation is way forward to reduce manual handling risks posed to ambulance workers. The output from case study 1 (tail lift) has been included in the national specification for future Emergency Ambulances in the UK...|$|E
