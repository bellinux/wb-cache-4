5|$|In December 2015, Miami-Dade Transit {{initiated}} a monthlong pilot program for express service between key stations during rush hours. During morning rush, many stations are <b>skipped</b> {{from the north}} and south en route to downtown, and in the afternoon, stations are <b>skipped</b> as the trains leave downtown. The service was well received, though it only saved a few minutes' time, partially due to the headway limitations with a system only having two tracks. The service continued past December.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 1989, the 1/ weekday skip-stop service started. The {{plan was}} to have skip-stop service begin north of 116th Street–Columbia University, but due to objections, most notably that riders did not want 125th Street to be a skip-stop station, skip-stop service was only {{implemented}} north of 137th Street–City College between the hours of 6:30am and 7:00pm. All 1 trains <b>skipped</b> Marble Hill–225th, 207th, 191st and 145th Streets, while all 9 trains <b>skipped</b> 238th, 215th, Dyckman and 157th Streets. On September 4, 1994, midday skip-stop service was discontinued, and 191st Street {{was no longer a}} skip-stop station.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we empirically {{explore the}} effects of various kinds of <b>skip</b> {{connections}} in stacked bidirectional LSTMs for sequential tagging. We investigate three kinds of <b>skip</b> connections connecting to LSTM cells: (a) <b>skip</b> connections to the gates, (b) <b>skip</b> connections to the internal states and (c) <b>skip</b> connections to the cell outputs. We present comprehensive experiments showing that <b>skip</b> connections to cell outputs outperform the remaining two. Furthermore, we observe that using gated identity functions as <b>skip</b> mappings works pretty well. Based on this novel <b>skip</b> connections, we successfully train deep stacked bidirectional LSTM models and obtain state-of-the-art results on CCG supertagging and comparable results on POS tagging.

A series of properties on the dense <b>skip</b> tree is proven, {{in order to show}} the probabilistic organization of data in a cache-conscious design. Performance benchmarks show the dense <b>skip</b> tree to outperform the <b>skip</b> list and the self-balancing binary search tree when the working set cannot be contained in cache. ...|$|R
5000|$|PIC cores have <b>skip</b> instructions, {{which are}} used for {{conditional}} execution and branching. The <b>skip</b> instructions are [...] "skip if bit set" [...] and [...] "skip if bit not set". Because cores before PIC18 had only unconditional branch instructions, conditional jumps are implemented by a conditional <b>skip</b> (with the opposite condition) followed by an unconditional branch. <b>Skips</b> are also of utility for conditional execution of any immediate single following instruction. It is possible to <b>skip</b> <b>skip</b> instructions. For example, the instruction sequence [...] "skip if A; <b>skip</b> if B; C" [...] will execute C if A is true or if B is false.|$|R

The following year he began cycling to Manchester Airfield, where he would do odd jobs in exchange for the occasional ride in an airplane or informal flying lesson.|$|E
5|$|Smelting, {{which is}} an {{essential}} part of the primary production, is often <b>skipped</b> during secondary production. It is only performed when metallic lead had undergone significant oxidation. The process is similar to that of primary production in either a blast furnace or a rotary furnace, with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields. The Isasmelt process is a more recent method that may act as an extension to primary production; battery paste from spent lead–acid batteries has sulfur removed by treating it with alkali, and is then treated in a coal-fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen, which yields impure lead, with antimony the most common impurity. Refining of secondary lead is similar to that of primary lead; some refining processes may be <b>skipped</b> depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination, with bismuth and silver most commonly being accepted as impurities.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new type of search trees, called <b>Skip</b> trees, which are a {{generalization}} of <b>Skip</b> lists. To be precise, there is a one-to-one mapping between the two data types which commutes with the sequential update algorithms. A <b>Skip</b> list is a data structure used to manage data bases which stores values in a sorted way and in which it is insured that the form of the <b>Skip</b> list is independent of the order of updates by using randomization techniques. <b>Skip</b> trees inherit all the properties of <b>Skip</b> lists, including the time bounds of sequential algorithms. The algorithmic improvement of the <b>Skip</b> tree type is that a concurrent algorithm on the fly approach can be designed. Among other advantages, this algorithm is more compressive than the one designed by Pugh for <b>Skip</b> lists and accepts a higher degree of concurrence because it is based on a set of local updates. From a practical point of view, although the <b>Skip</b> list should be in the main memory, <b>Skip</b> trees can be registered into a secondary [...] ...|$|R
