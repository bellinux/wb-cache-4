40|$|Medical {{authority}} is invoked ever more frequently, also in {{situations that are}} {{outside the scope of}} scientific medicine. The main but latent function of this medicalization is the resolution of social conflict. This occurs more often than not in tacit collusion between a work organization (or the wider community) on the one hand, the individualized 'patient' on the other hand and the doctor as the arbiter who defines <b>socially</b> <b>contested</b> issues in <b>terms</b> of medical problems. As scientific medicine provides insufficient justification of these medical interventions, they threaten to become the subject of open controversy within the organized medical profession and thus to undermine professional unanimity, and with it the authority of the profession as a whole. This explains the reluctance of organized medicine to claim these new fields as its legitimate province. medical profession medicalization social conflict...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{the risk}} management perspective that superior social performance enhances firm value by {{serving as an}} ex ante valuable insurance mechanism. We posit that good social performance is more valuable as an insurance mechanism for firms with higher litigation risks. Moreover, value generation of corporate social performance (CSP) depends on whether a firm has gained pragmatic legitimacy (i. e., a firm 2 ̆ 7 s financial health) and moral legitimacy (i. e., {{whether or not a}} firm operates in a <b>socially</b> <b>contested</b> industry) among its stakeholders. We find that the value of CSP as insurance against litigation risk is practically significant, adding 2 to 4 percent to firm value. But CSP is less likely to create value if the firm is in financial distress or is operating in <b>socially</b> <b>contested</b> industries...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on an {{abortive}} attempt to co-ordinate a local governance network {{in the domain of}} older persons' care in England. It locates a key source of failure in pressures in the policy context. Exogenous factors are analysed using a tiered (macro-/meso-/ micro-) model linking context and agents. People occupy specific positions in the policy system and can respond differently to erratic contextual prompts. This putative autonomy imposes limits on the assumed trajectory and ontology of whole-networks in <b>socially</b> <b>contested</b> arenas and delimits the strategic space for network governance. Networks are thus as often effects as causes of social change. © 2011 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

In doing so, it explores a number of questions, including: {{how do we know}} if someone is dead or not? What do people experience at the moment when they die? Is death simply a biological event that comes about in temporal stages of decomposition, or is it a social event defined through cultures, practices, and commemorations? In other words, when exactly is death? Taken together, these contributions explore how death emerges in a series of stages that are uncertain, paradoxical, and <b>socially</b> <b>contested...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{membership}} in new, often <b>socially</b> <b>contested,</b> religious movements (NRMs) on mental health of members and ex-members is still a controversial question in the psychological literature. In the present study, we interviewed 20 ex-members of various NRMs who also completed questionnaires measuring several cognitive (need for closure, world assumptions) and affective-emotional (parental and adult attachment, social relationships, depression) constructs. Ex-members were then compared with current NRM members and with individuals not involved in NRMs. It appeared that NRM membership compensated for some previously existing vulnerabilities reported by members (insecure attachment in childhood, few social relationships, negative life events). However, this supportive effect did not persist after the destabilizing experience of disaffiliation. Yet, ex-members remained strong believers and were very inclined to spirituality...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{sentiment}} analysis has been focusing on inference of the sentiment polarity using sentiment-bearing words. In this paper, we propose {{a new way}} of studying sentiment and capturing ontological changes in a domain specific context in the perspective of computational linguistics using affect proxies. We used Nexis service to create a domain specific corpus focusing on banking sectors. We then created an affect dictionary from three kinds of lexica: sentiment lexica as in the General Inquirer dictionary; news flow represented by domain entities such as financial regulators and banks; and what we call <b>contested</b> <b>term</b> lexica, which consists of terms whose semantic implication is inconsistent over time. Univariate and multivariate analysis techniques such as factor analysis are used to explore the relationships and underlying patterns among the three types of lexica. Analysis results suggest that citations of regulatory entities show strong correlation with negative sentiments in the banking context. Also, a factor analysis was conducted, which reveals several groups of variables in which the <b>contested</b> <b>terms</b> correlate with positive and negative sentiments...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the context}} of {{multiple}} crises and change, a range of practices discussed under the umbrella term of collaborative (or sharing) economy have been gaining considerable attention. Supporters build an idealistic vision of collaborative societies. Critics have been stripping the concept of its visionary potential, questioning its revolutionary nature. In the study, these debates are brought down to the local level in search for common perceptions among the co-creators of the concept in Vienna, Austria. Towards this aim a Q study is conducted, i. e. a mixed method enabling analyses of subjective perceptions on <b>socially</b> <b>contested</b> topics. Four framings are identified: Visionary Supporters, Market Optimists, Visionary Critics, and Skeptics, each bringing their values, visions, and practical goals characteristic of different understanding of the collaborative economy.

From there, contributors raise considerations of collective memory in prisoner-of-war survivors and among football fans attending a World Cup event. The next contribution illustrates how collective forgetting creates social bonds in a similar manner to collective remembering. Finally, we show how the boundaries of memory are being stretched by digital technology through its influence on how we recall and share memories. Methodological innovations are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|What kind of {{constitution}} is emerging in Europe? There are two approaches to answering this question. The first, a ‘foundational’ approach, rejects the premise: {{there can be}} no real constitution {{in the absence of a}} ‘demos’, a foundation which exists only nationally. The second, ‘freestanding’ approach, depicts it as paradigmatic of a broader phenomenon of cosmopolitan constitutionalism, based on individual rights guaranteed through a transnational rule of law. Rejecting both for their failure to account for European constitutionalism as a historical process of polity-building, a third approach, ‘political constitutionalism’, is proposed, capturing the dynamic quality of constitutionalisation in the EU. From this perspective, what is emerging in Europe is a constitution that reflects a common good (predominantly conceived in economic terms), albeit one which is legally, political and <b>socially</b> <b>contested.</b> It is by capturing this complex picture of the political formation of Europe that the constitutional question will be most fruitfully pursued...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the central}} role of {{legitimacy}} in corporate social responsibility debate, little is known of subtle meaning-making processes through which social actors attempt to establish or de-establish legitimacy for <b>socially</b> <b>contested</b> corporate undertakings, and through which they, at the same time, struggle to define the proper social role and responsibility of corporations. We investigated these processes {{in the context of the}} intense socio-political conflict around the Finnish forest industry company Metsa¨-Botnia’s world-scale pulp mill in Uruguay. A critical discursive analysis of Finnish media texts highlights three types of struggle that characterized the media coverage: legalistic argumentation, truth fights, and political battles. Interestingly, this case illustrates how the corporate representatives — with the help of the national media — tend to frame the issue in legalistic terms, emphasize their expert knowledge in technical and environmental evaluations, and distance themselves from political disputes. We argue that similar tendencies are likely to characterize corporate social responsibility debates more generally...|$|R

However, {{the accounts}} of professionals involved in its use have rarely been systematically investigated. This study aimed to examine {{the accounts of}} clinicians who have used ECT on a routine basis. Eight health professionals (psychiatrists, anaesthetists and psychiatric nurses from a major city in the United Kingdom) with experience of ECT administration were interviewed about the procedure. Discourse {{analysis was used to}} interpret the interview transcripts. Interviewees appeared to draw on a repertoire, which constructed ECT recipients as severely ill. This was used to support claims which had the effect of: defining who should receive ECT; warranting the use of urgent physical psychiatric treatments; reformulating distress in biological terms; and discounting the therapeutic value of alternative, non-physical interventions. The interviewees managed concerns about ECT in a variety of ways, for example by: rendering it as a medical procedure with concomitant risks and benefits; downplaying a lack of clarity over its evidence base; and undermining the legitimacy of criticisms. Implications of these findings are discussed. Discourse analysis Electroconvulsive therapy Debates Persuasive communication UK...|$|R

40|$|Individualisation theory misrepresents and romanticises {{the nature}} of agency as a {{primarily}} discursive and reflexive process where people freely create their personal lives in an open social world divorced from tradition. But empirically we find that people usually make decisions about their personal lives pragmatically, bounded by circumstances and in connection with other people, not only relationally but also institutionally. This pragmatism is often non-reflexive, habitual and routinised, even unconscious. Agents draw on existing traditions - styles of thinking, sanctioned social relationships, institutions, the presumptions of particular social groups and places, lived law and social norms - to 'patch' or 'piece together' responses to changing situations. Often it is institutions that 'do the thinking'. People try to both conserve social energy and seek social legitimation in this adaption process, a process {{which can lead to}} a 're-serving' of tradition even as institutional leakage transfers meanings from past to present, and vice versa. But this process of bricolage will always be <b>socially</b> <b>contested</b> and <b>socially</b> uneven.
