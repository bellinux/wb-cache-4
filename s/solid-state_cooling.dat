Regarding barocaloric materials, recent results show that elastomers are promising candidates for cooling applications around room-temperature. In the present paper, we report super-giant barocaloric effects observed in acetoxy silicone rubber - a very popular, low-cost and environmentally friendly elastomer. Huge values of adiabatic temperature change (up to ΔTS = - 41. 1 K) and isothermal entropy change (up to ΔST = - 348 J kg- 1 K- 1) were obtained upon moderate applied pressures and relatively low strains. These huge barocaloric effects are associated to the polymer chains rearrangements and to the first-order structural transitions. Our results overtake those of any other barocaloric materials reported previously, opening encouraging prospects for the application of elastomers in near future <b>solid-state</b> <b>cooling</b> devices.

This quick recycle time relies upon high-conductivity thermal straps to couple the individual stages {{to a pair of}} heat switches without imposing a lateral load on the paramagnetic salt pills. To accomplish this we construct thermal straps using a technique of diffusion bonding together the ends of high-purity copper straps leaving the length between as individual foils. A thermal bus created this way has a thermal conductivity comparable to a solid strap of the equivalent thickness but with much-increased flexibility. The technique for selecting the base material, machining, cleaning, forming into final shape, and finally bonding together individual foils will be discussed along with examples of complete straps in various geometries...|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of <b>solid-state</b> <b>cooling</b> technology, four kinds of caloric effects, magnetocaloric (MC), electrocaloric (EC), barocaloric (BC) and elastocaloric (eC) effects, are compared in view of environment discussion and application fields. This field is primarily developed in the intention of protecting the environment. However, some widely researched caloric materials do not meet environmental friendly criteria. Currently, new caloric materials (called "good" material) possessing the properties of friendly environment, low cost, high caloric performance and practicability (low stress) need to be found. In view of application, all current caloric effects/materials are investigated for the common objective of cooling. However, the adapted application cases for different caloric effects/materials are not considered. Due to the different stimuli and different intrinsic properties (different caloric performance for different dimensions) of caloric materials, they can exhibit unique advantage to different application cases. "Good" caloric material used for large-scale application is still less and deserve more search. Purposeful research will save the cost and accelerate the commercialization.

40|$|Traditional vapor {{compression}} cooling refrigerants {{are considered}} as high global-warming-potential (GWP) gases which face {{more and more}} legislation pressure nowadays. As an alternative option other than using synthetic low GWP refrigerants and natural refrigerants, <b>solid-state</b> <b>cooling</b> technologies show their advantages of zero GWP, and therefore recently attract more attentions. Apart from those well-studied <b>solid-state</b> <b>cooling</b> technologies, such as thermoelectric cooling, thermoacoustic cooling and magnetic cooling, thermoelastic cooling, a. k. a. elastocaloric cooling, is still under development and shows potential of better thermal performance compared with its competitors. In fact, from material perspective, it was estimated by literatures that the COPs for elastocaloric materials are 20 % - 120 % higher than other <b>solid-state</b> <b>cooling</b> materials under the same operating conditions. This study introduces the thermoelastic cooling concept at the beginning, and then demonstrates one method to operate the compression thermoelastic cooling cycle for air-conditioning application based on the reverse Martensitic phase transition principle. A dynamic model is developed to measure the temperature within the cycle in cyclic operation mode. The cyclic operation is a Brayton cycle consisting of an adiabatic Martensite-Austenite phase transition process, a constant strain heat transfer process between the solid-state refrigerant and the heat sink/source, and a heat recovery process aiming to improve the overall performance. The model uses experimental curve-fitted data to predict the work required to drive the cycle. The coefficient of performance (COP) and cooling capacity are then evaluated based on the power prediction. Parametric studies are conducted to investigate the influence of several significant parameters on the COP and cooling capacity from the model. It is found that the cycle duration parameters, the solid state refrigerant thickness, and operating flow rates are major contributing factors to the performance indices. Based on the parametric study results, a design guideline is then provided for the future researches...|$|E

40|$|Good {{mechanical}} properties and large adiabatic temperature change render Heusler-type Ni 2 FeGa-based magnetic shape memory alloys as a promising candidate material for <b>solid-state</b> mechanical <b>cooling</b> application at ambient conditions. Superelastic behavior and associated elastocaloric effect strongly reply on deformation conditions (e. g. applied strain rate and strain level) of stress-induced martensitic transformations. With {{the aim of}} developing high-performance elastic cooling materials, in this work, we have carried out a systematic study on a Ni 54 Fe 19 Ga 27 [420]-oriented single crystal by exploring the interaction between dynamic deformation parameters and thermal response. A giant and reversible adiabatic temperature change of +/- 7. 5 K triggered by a low stress of 30 MPa was achieved. Such a high specific cooling performance thus offers the great advantage for the small scale <b>solid-state</b> mechanical <b>cooling</b> applications. Besides, a significant temporary residual strain effect has been observed at high strain rate, which is unfavorable for reversible elastocaloric effect but can be overcome by reducing stress hysteresis, and/or by elevating initial environmental temperature.
