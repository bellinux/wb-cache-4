40|$|Abstract—when {{the noise}} {{cancellation}} system (NC) {{is used in}} the down link of the power line carrier terminal, it can cancel the background noise and narrowband interference, but the downlink <b>signal</b> <b>tone</b> distorts at the same time. This is because the VAD algorithm of the NC system is sensitive to dramatic changes in the power of <b>signal</b> <b>tone.</b> Through detailed researches on time frequency characteristics of <b>signal</b> <b>tone</b> and error factors of network transmission, a new <b>signal</b> <b>tone</b> detection algorithm that applicable to downlink NC system was put forward, The algorithm detects <b>signal</b> <b>tones</b> through changes of frequency-domain power and time-domain signal period of every frame. After theoretical evaluation and practice tests, it is observed that the above-mentioned algorithm can correctly detect <b>signal</b> <b>tones</b> without influence on functions of the NC system, so as to avoid the occurrence of distortion...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} channel fading of multitone {{interference}} {{on the performance}} of multiple hops per symbol fast frequency-hopped (FFH), M-ary orthogonal frequency-shift keyed (MFSK) noncoherent systems are analytically investigated. The multiple equal-power interference tones are assumed to correspond to some of the possible FFH/M-ary orthogonal <b>signaling</b> <b>tones.</b> It is also assumed that the channel fading characteristics are independent for the <b>signal</b> <b>tone</b> and interference tone. We evaluate how the effect of the multitone interference fading on system performance is changed by various parameters, such as the number of interference tones, the number of hops per symbol and the modulation order.

40|$|In this experiment, {{listeners}} detected sequential tonal patterns {{embedded in}} multitone multiburst random maskers. The maskers consisted of eight 30 ms bursts of random-frequency <b>tones.</b> The <b>signal,</b> when present, occupied the central six bursts and was centered at 1000 Hz. The six sequential <b>signal</b> <b>tones</b> formed several spectro-temporal patterns: an equal-frequency pattern, three ascending patterns with frequency ranges spanning 0. 5 -, 1 -, and 2 -equivalent rectangular bandwidths (ERBs), and a random pattern with frequencies drawn at random from {{the range of}} 925 – 1075 Hz. The total number of tones in each burst, m, was varied to determine detection threshold. The detectability of the signal pattern declined as the frequency range of the signal pattern increased, and when the signal was random. Relative weights {{as a function of}} time and frequency, interpreted as listeners’ internal templates, depended systematically on the properties of the signal pattern tested.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis investigates the performance degradation resulting from multitone interference of orthogonal, noncoherent, frequency-hopped, M-ary frequency-shift keyed receivers (FH/MFSK) where {{the effect of}} thermal and other wideband noise is not neglected. The multiple, equal power jamming tones are assumed to correspond to {{some or all of}} the possible FH M-ary orthogonal <b>signaling</b> <b>tones.</b> Furthermore, the channel is modeled as a Ricean fading channel, a possibility precluded when thermal noise is neglected. Both the <b>signaling</b> <b>tones</b> and the multiple interference tones are assumed to be affected by channel fading. Both band and independent band multitone interference are considered. Performance is evaluated by obtaining a union bound on the probability of bit error, and receiver performance is compared with exact results for band multitone interference of a noncoherent FH/MFSK receiver under comparable circumstances. Except for the case of Rayleigh fading of the signal, the union bound is very tight for those cases that can be compared with exact results. The advantages of the union bound approach are twofold. First, the union bound approach yields a solution that is far less computationally intensive than that obtained with the exact approach. Second, the union bound approach allows numerical results to be obtained for interference conditions that are not amenable to exact analysis, such as independent multitone interference of FH/ MFSK[URL] JG, Hellenic Nav...|$|R

The multiple equal-power interference tones are assumed to correspond to some of the possible FFH/M-ary orthogonal <b>signaling</b> <b>tones.</b> It is also assumed that the channel fading characteristics of the <b>signal</b> and interference <b>tones</b> are independent. We evaluate the effect of the channel fading on the system's performance as a function of various parameters, such as the number of hops per symbol, the signal power to multitone interference power ratio, and the number of interference tones. Our numerical results indicate that by use of square-law time diversity combining, a large number of hops per symbol make the bit-error probability of the system more sensitive to the fading of multitone interference.

40|$|In radio over fiber (RoF) systems {{there are}} two popular optical {{subcarrier}} modulations (SCMs) which are single side band (SSB) modulation and tandem single side band (TSSB) modulation. In TSSB modulation one optical carrier carries half of radio frequency (RF) <b>signal</b> <b>tones</b> to lower sideband (LSB) and the reminder to upper sideband (USB); while in SSB modulation all multiple RF <b>signal</b> <b>tones</b> in either LSB or USB. We analyze the impact of nonlinear distortion considering one wavelength carrying two RF signals. For small modulation depth TSSB and SSB SCMs lead to similar and very small nonlinear distortion. Because harmonic distortions (HDs) and inter-modulation distortion (IMDs) are strongly dependent on modulation depth, TSSB and SSB SCMs lead to different nonlinear distortion if modulation depth is not small, depending on two RF difference. To reduce nonlinear distortion for high modulation depth the two RF difference of 1 GHz is preferred for both TSSB and SSB SCMs because some nonlinear distortions are dependent on the difference and sum of the two RFs and transmission fiber. However for the larger RF difference, either small modulation depth or medium modulation depth combined with minimum RF of 6 GHz has to be used. Comparison of TSSB and SSB SCMs in DWDM RoF systems with 12. 5 GHz channel spacing and two subcarriers uniformly distributed in the optical spectrum shows that better performance is obtained using SSB SCM when small modulation depth is used. On the contrary, TSSB SCM is better than SSB SCM when large modulation depth is used...|$|R
