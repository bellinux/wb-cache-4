[...] I just wanted to do the best job I could do for her. When we would play back 'Holiday' or 'Lucky Star', you could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> overwhelmed by how great it all sounded. You wanted to help her, you know?

500|$|Hong Kong {{regards the}} Erwiana Sulistyaningsih case as isolated, and its labour {{minister}} pledged to increase regulation, enforcement and employment-agency inspections. It has conducted several raids on migrant workers accused of not living at their employer's residence. However, Robert Godden of Amnesty Asia-Pacific said: [...] "The specifics, {{many of the}} factors leading to the abuse , {{can be applied to}} thousands of migrant domestic workers: underpayment, restrictions on movement; you can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> heavily indebted by the illegal recruitment fees charged by the agency, {{and you can see that}} she didn't know how to access justice."

500|$|The {{essential}} {{idea here}} is intuitive and probably qualifies as folk wisdom. [...] It was articulated by Kurt Vonnegut in his 1961 short story Harrison Bergeron. In Vonnegutâ€™s futuristic dystopia, the Handicapper General uses {{a variety of}} handicapping mechanisms to reduce inequalities in performance. [...] A spectator at a ballet comments: [...] "it was easy to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the strongest and most graceful of all dancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two hundred pound men." [...] Zahavi interpreted this analogy to mean that higher quality peacocks with bigger tails are signalling their ability to [...] "waste" [...] more of some resource by trading it off for a bigger tail. This resonates with Thorstein Veblen's idea that conspicuous consumption and extravagant status symbols can signal wealth.|$|E

[...] Loos convinced herself that he would <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> different from all his other girls, and that behind his outwardly dull exterior was a great mind.
