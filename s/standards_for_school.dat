25|$|Reform {{mathematics}} is {{an approach to}} mathematics education, particularly in North America. It is based on principles explained in 1989 by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). The NCTM document, Curriculum and Evaluation <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>School</b> Mathematics, attempted to set forth a vision for K-12 (ages 5-18) mathematics education in the United States and Canada. Their recommendations were adopted by many education agencies, from local to federal levels through the 1990s. In 2000, NCTM revised its standards {{with the publication of}} Principles and <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>School</b> Mathematics (PSSM). Like the first publication, these updated standards have continued to {{serve as the basis for}} many states' mathematics standards, and for many federally funded textbook projects. The first standards gave a strong call for a de-emphasis on manual arithmetic in favor of students' discovering their own knowledge and conceptual thinking. The PSSM has taken a more balanced view, but still emphasizes conceptual thinking and problem solving.|$|E

25|$|Partly {{using his}} {{experience}} as a teacher, Robertson also focused on improving Oklahoma’s school system. First, he worked to change how colleges operated in Oklahoma. Before his administration, colleges had been supervised by the State Board of Education under the State School Superintendent. Under Robertson, the governor's power over colleges increased with the creation of a Board of State Regents, its members appointed by the governor, to oversee all institutions of higher education. In his budgets, Robertson also funded improvements in teacher certification, higher <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>school</b> performance and accreditation, consolidation of many rural schools, and institution of a subsidized textbook program. He proposed increased funding for schools with apparent inadequacies, but this measure was rejected by the legislature.|$|E

2500|$|According to a 2015 Congressional Budget Office {{report on}} child {{nutrition}} programs, {{it is more}} likely that food insecure children will participate in school nutrition programs than children from food secure families. School nutrition programs, such as the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP) have provided millions of children access to healthier lunch and breakfast meals, since their inceptions in the mid-1900s. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NSLP has served over 300 million, while SBP has served about 10 million students each day. Nevertheless, far too many qualifying students still fail to receive these benefits simply due to not submitting the necessary paperwork. Multiple studies have reported that school nutrition programs play an important role in ensuring students are accessing healthy meals. Students who ate school lunches provided by NLSP showed higher diet quality than if they had their own lunches. Even more, the USDA improved <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>school</b> meals, which ultimately lead to positive impacts on children’s food selection and eating habits.|$|E
2500|$|Georgios Drossinis {{was born}} and raised in Athens, but he came from a family from Mesolonghi which had fought in the celebrated year-long siege of the city by the Ottomans during the Greek War of Independence. [...] studied Philology in Athens and in Germany, but did not {{complete}} his studies. Drossinis was one of the co-founders (along with Kostis Palamas and Nikos Kampas) of the ‘1880s Generation’, which renewed modern Greek literature by reacting to already decayed romanticism. He contributed to the development and establishment of modern Greek language ("Demotic") and to the turn towards Greek folk tradition. Drossinis showed great interest in educational issues and wrote school books. From 1908, he took up important positions in the Ministry of Education. During his service, he founded school libraries, introduced <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>school</b> hygiene and established the National Flag Day on 26 October. He also contributed to the foundation of a Home for the Blind, the Sevastopouleios Vocational School, the Hellenic Laographic Society and the compilation of the Historical Dictionary of the Greek Language. His contribution to the implementation of Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos’ educational programme during the 1910s was substantial. With Demetrios Vikelas, he co-founded the Society for the Dissemination of Beneficial Books (in Greek, Σ.Ω.Β.). In addition, he was editor-in-chief and director in a number of literary and educational publications (Estia magazine, To Asty, To Imerologion Tis Megalis Elladas ("Journal of Great Greece"). He worked towards the foundation of the Academy of Athens (1926) and became one of its first members. He was honoured by the Academy of Athens with the “Award for Excellence in Arts and Letters” and in 1947, he was nominated by the Greek State for the Nobel Prize in Literature.|$|E
