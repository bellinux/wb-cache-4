In 1850 an act for the better government of the Australian colonies was passed, which provided that the existing nominee councils should frame electoral acts for new elected councils. A council of 16 members was elected in Tasmania, all supporting the Anti-Transportation movement, and the governor's power was now much reduced. He, however, incurred some criticism by proclaiming pre-emptive right land regulations before the new Council met. The proclamation was intended to help to keep <b>small</b> <b>holders</b> of land in Tasmania, but the large graziers and speculators defeated this by taking up large tracts of land. Denison, however, became more popular {{towards the end of}} his term. In September 1854 he received word that he had been appointed Governor of New South Wales, and when he left Hobart on 13 January 1855 he received a cheque for £2000 from the colonists to purchase a piece of plate as a memento of his sojourn among them. After correspondence with the Secretary of State he was allowed to accept this. One of his last official acts was to support the Legislative Council's request that the colony's name be changed to Tasmania.|$|E

This perception of foreign occupation, coupled with a growing race-prejudice against the African-descended West Indians led to considerable tension, as the arrival of the West Indians drove demographic change in the region.|$|E

Tiberius [...] "was of a good and moral disposition, of gentle aspect and quiet bearing, apparently fitted for anything rather than for an agitator of the masses." [...] At that time political reform was widely discussed among aristocrats; yet the senate always avoided it. Tiberius declared for reform. Perhaps he was personally motivated by an incident as questor with the Army on campaign in Hispania: there he had escaped a terrible ordeal because of his elite connections. Reformist ideals of this [...] "young, upright and proud man" [...] were nourished by Hellenic rhetoricians. [...] "hen his intentions became known... there was no want of approving voices, and many a public placard summoned the grandson of Africanus {{to think of the}} poor people and the deliverance of Italy."

[...] The land reform was to benefit <b>small</b> <b>holders,</b> to restore prosperity to the [...] "free farmers" [...] of Italy; it concerned rural state lands de facto long held in the possession of wealthy families both of Rome and of Latin allies. His proposed law seemed to garner senate support, but it was effectively vetoed by another tribune acting on behalf of powerful Roman landowners; twice his bill was vetoed.

40|$|A central {{question}} to agricultural extension literature is whether service delivery {{is responsive to}} the needs of <b>small</b> <b>holder</b> farmers. Previous research has focussed on the role of methodological characteristics in the technology diffusion. In this thesis, I argue that the effectiveness of extension systems is determined by the institutional arrangements with which services are provided. Using the new institutionalism theory, I analyse how decentralisation and privatisation policies provide an environment for demand driven service delivery to work. Then, {{the way in which the}} private, private and non governmental interact in order to reduce the costs of drafting and enforcing contracts. On the demand side, I analyse the effect of farmer organisations in increasing <b>small</b> <b>holder</b> farmers’ access to resources and how they perceive the services that are provided. Data is collected through semi structured interviews with 28 key informants at district, sub county and national levels and a survey of 80 <b>small</b> <b>holder</b> farmers on their attitudes and perceptions toward extension delivery. 	Research findings suggest that the policy and legal frameworks relating to decentralisation and privatisation shape the environment within which demand driven extension systems in Kabarole District thrive. Shared norms and values determine the level of interaction between actors and their level commitment to the overall principles of demand driven systems. Furthermore, when <b>small</b> <b>holder</b> farmers are organised in groups they are able to gain collective access to resources and also exercise their “voice” in demanding services. The strength of the new institutionalism theory lies in its ability to analyse phenomenon as a system. Demand driven systems involve a number of actors whose behaviour is shaped by social, economic, cultural and political factors. These findings are critical to the decentralisation and pro-poor responsiveness debate which argues that increasing access to extension services to <b>small</b> <b>holder</b> farmers enables them to gain access to resources and also transform into commercial farmers...|$|R

6000|$|A rough census {{taken in}} 1916 among our {{soldiers}} gave the astounding figure of 750,000 desirous {{of going on}} the land. That figure will shrink to a mere skeleton unless on demobilisation the Government is ready with a comprehensive plan. The men fall roughly into two classes: those who were already on the land; those who were not. The first will {{want to go back}} to their own districts, but not to the cottages and wages they had before the war. For them, it is essential to provide new cottages with larger gardens, otherwise they will go to the Dominions, to America, or to the towns. A fresh census should be taken and kept up to date, the wants of each man noted, and a definite attempt made now to earmark sites and material for building, to provide the garden plots, and plan the best and prettiest type of cottage. For lack of labour and material no substantial progress can be made with housing while the war is on, but if a man can see his cottage and his ground ready, in the air, he will wait; if he cannot, he will be off, and we shall have lost him. Wages are not to fall again below twenty-five shillings, and will probably stay at a considerably higher level. The cottage and the garden ground for these men will be the determining factor, and that garden ground should be at least an acre. A larger class by far will be men who were not on the land, but having tasted open-air life, think they wish to continue it. A fresh census of this class and their wants should be taken also. It will subdivide them into men who want the life of independent medium and <b>small</b> <b>holders,</b> with from 100 to 20 acres of land, and men who with 5 or 10 acres of their own are willing to supplement their living by seasonal work on the large farms. For all a cut-and-dried scheme providing land and homes is absolutely essential. If they cannot be assured of having these within a few months of their return to civil life, they will go either to the Dominions or back to the towns. One of them, I am told, thus forecasts their future wants: [...] "When we're free we shall have a big spree in the town; we shall then take the first job that comes along; if it's an indoor job we shan't be able to stick it and shall want to get on the land." [...] I am pretty sure he's wrong. He will want his spree, of course; but if he is allowed to go back to a town job he is not at all likely to leave it again. Men so soon get used to things, and the towns have a fierce grip. For this second class, no less than the first, it is vital to have the land ready, and the cottages estimated for. I think men of both these classes, when free, should be set at once to the building of their own homes and the preparation of their land. I think huts ought to be ready for them and their wives till their homes are habitable. A man who takes a hand in the building of his house, and the first work on his new holding, is far less likely to abandon his idea of settling on the land than a man who is simply dumped into a ready-made concern. That is human nature. Let him begin at the beginning, and while his house is going up be assisted and instructed. Frankly, I am afraid that in the difficulty of fixing on an ideal scheme and ideal ways of working it, we shall forget that the moment of demobilisation is unique. Any scheme, however rough and ready, which will fix men or their intention of settling on the land in Britain at the moment of demobilisation will be worth a hundred better-laid plans which have waited for perfection till that one precious moment is overpast. While doctors quarrel, or lay their heads together, the patient dies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, sir," [...] replied his dragoman, [...] "the {{agricultural}} {{movement in}} this country {{since the days of}} the Great Skirmish, when all were talking of resettling the land, may be summed up in two words: 'Town Expansion.' In order to make this clear to you, however, I must remind you of the political currents of the past thirty years. You will not recollect that during the Great Skirmish, beneath the seeming absence of politics, there were germinating the Parties of the future. A secret but resolute intention was forming in all minds to immolate those who had played any part in politics before and during the important world-tragedy which was then being enacted, especially such as continued to hold portfolios, or persisted in asking questions in the House of Commons, as it was then called. It was not that people held them to be responsible, but nerves required soothing, and there is no anodyne, as you know, sir, equal to human sacrifice. The politician was, as one may say--'off.' No sooner, of course, was peace declared than the first real General Election was held, and it was with a certain chagrin that the old Parties found themselves in the soup. The Parties which had been forming beneath the surface swept the country; one called itself the Patriotic, and was called by its opponents the Prussian Party; the other called itself the Laborious, and was called by its opponents the Loafing Party. Their representatives were nearly all new men. In the first flush of peace, with which the human mind ever associates plenty, they came out on such an even keel that no Government could pass anything at all. Since, however, it was imperative to find the interest on a National Debt of £8,000,000,000, a further election was needed. This time, though the word Peace remained, the word Plenty had already vanished; and the Laborious Party, which, having much less to tax, felt that it could tax more freely, found itself in an overwhelming majority. You will be curious to hear, sir, of what elements this Party was composed. Its solid bulk were the returned soldiers, and the other manual workers of the country; but to this main body there was added a rump, of pundits, men of excellent intentions, brains, and principles, such as in old days had been known as Radicals and advanced Liberals. These had joined out of despair, feeling that otherwise their very existence was jeopardised. To this collocation--and to one or two other circumstances, as you will presently see, sir--the doom of the land must be traced. Now, the Laborious Party, apart from its rump, on which it would or could not sit--we shall never know now--had views about the resettlement of the land not far divergent from those held by the Patriotic Party, and they proceeded to put a scheme into operation, which, for perhaps a year, seemed to have a prospect of success. Many returned soldiers were established in favourable localities, and there was even a disposition to place the country on a self-sufficing basis in regard to food. But they had not been in power eighteen months when their rump--which, as I have told you, contained nearly all their principles--had a severe attack of these. 'Free Trade,'--which, say what you will, follows the line of least resistance and is based on the 'good of trade'--was, they perceived, endangered, and they began to agitate against bonuses on corn and preferential treatment of a pampered industry. The bonus on corn was in consequence rescinded in 1924, and in lieu thereof the system of small holdings was extended--on paper. At the same time the somewhat stunning taxation which had been placed upon the wealthy began to cause the break-up of landed estates. As the general bankruptcy and exhaustion of Europe became more and more apparent the notion of danger from future war began to seem increasingly remote, and the 'good of trade' became again the one object before every British eye. Food from overseas was cheapening once more. The inevitable occurred. Country mansions became a drug in the market, farmers farmed at a loss; <b>small</b> <b>holders</b> went bust daily, and emigrated; agricultural labourers sought the towns. In 1926 the Laborious Party, who had carried the taxation of their opponents to a pitch beyond the power of human endurance, got what the racy call 'the knock,' and the four years which followed witnessed the bitterest internecine struggle within the memory of every journalist. In the course of this strife emigration increased and the land emptied rapidly. The final victory of the Laborious Party, in 1930, saw them, still propelled by their rump, committed, among other things, to a pure town policy. They have never been out of power since; the result you see. Food is now entirely brought from overseas, largely by submarine and air service, in tabloid form, and expanded to its original proportions on arrival by an ingenious process discovered by a German. The country is now used only as a subject for sentimental poets, and to fly over, or by lovers on bicycles at week-ends." ...|$|E

The LSA was disbanded in 1974 and some <b>small</b> <b>holders</b> were left destitute, others continued to farm the land as private owners. The LSA <b>small</b> <b>holders</b> were from a variety of backgrounds and places, Irish, Polish, Scottish, Cumbrian and other parts of England.|$|E
5000|$|In The Great National Problems, Molina Enríquez {{concluded}} that the Porfirio Díaz regime had promoted the growth of large haciendas although they were not as productive as small holdings. Citing his nearly decade long tenure as a notary, his claims were well-founded that haciendas were vastly under-assessed for tax purposes and that <b>small</b> <b>holders</b> were disadvantaged against the wealth and political connections of large estate owners. Since title transfers of property required payment of fees and that the fee was high enough to negatively affect <b>small</b> <b>holders</b> but not large. In addition, the local tax on title transfers {{was based on a}} property’s assessment, so in a similar fashion, <b>small</b> <b>holders</b> paid a higher percentage than large holders who had ample means to pay such taxes. [...] Large estates often occupied more land than they actually held title to, counting on their size and clout to survive challenges by those on whom they infringed. [...] A great number of individual <b>small</b> <b>holders</b> had only imperfect title to their land, some no title at all, so that Díaz’s requirement that land be properly titled or be subject to appropriation under the [...] "vacant lands" [...] law (terrenos baldíos) meant that they were at risk for losing their land. Indian pueblos also lost their land, but the two processes of land loss were not one and the same.|$|E

40|$|This Conceptual paper {{addresses}} {{the challenges facing}} the <b>small</b> <b>holder</b> tea sector in Kenya. It provides background information about tea growing in Kenya, its export performance, and organizational structure. It then categorizes the main challenges into five and provides some solutions to the challenges, borrowing from some supply chain management practices to culminate into competitive strategies. In the face of declining and shifting competitiveness of the <b>small</b> <b>holder</b> tea sector in Kenya, this paper identifies the special role of supplier and customer relationships, value addition, information technology, information sharing, flexibility in internal operations/processes, upgrading of tea seedlings, proper coordination, institutionalization, policy reforms, training, monitoring marketing environment, strategic decisions, irrigation, venturing in new markets through partnership, and civil society involvement as competitive supply chain strategies. </p...|$|R
6000|$|In this parish of Ditchingham, where I live, {{there is}} a man with a few acres of land, an orchard, a greenhouse, etc. That man works his little tenancy, deals in the surplus produce of large gardens, which he peddles out in the {{neighbouring}} town, and, on an average, takes piecework on my farm (at the moment of writing he and his son are hoeing mangolds) {{for two or three days}} a week; at any rate, for a great part of the year. He is a type of what I may call the natural <b>small</b> <b>holder,</b> and I believe does fairly well. The question is, can the artificially created <b>small</b> <b>holder,</b> who must pay a rent of £4 the acre, attain to a like result? ...|$|R
