We used the 2 D-CCD luminance meter and pattern generator for chessboard pattern. The test samples were burned in about 2 hours and the tested data were normalized by data before image <b>sticking</b> <b>test.</b> The normalized value was so sensitive {{for determining the}} image sticking level. We proposed a new parameter of ISV(image sticking value) for increasing sensitivity. It was resulted that the image sticking under ISV 1 % was difficult to be detected by human eye. And the image sticking over ISV 2 % was strongly detected. It was found that this test method is similar to human eye testing result. Therefore, this analysis method helps to determine the objective image sticking level. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the performance of point-of-care (POC) tests in detecting glucose and ketone bodies in postmortem (PM) samples and to assess the usefulness of POC tests in sample screening for more precise analyses. Glucose and ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), were measured from vitreous humor (VH) in 52 autopsy cases with a POC blood glucose monitoring device (BGMD). In addition glucose and ketone bodies, acetone (Ac) and acetoacetate (AcAc), were measured from urine samples in another set of 59 cases with semi-quantitative <b>stick</b> <b>tests.</b> The results were compared to the concentration in VH measured with validated methods (values > 7 mmol/l indicate possible hyperglycemia and total ketone body levels >= 3 mmol/l ketoacidosis). The sensitivity for glucose with the BGMD was 1. 0 and specificity 0. 94 when the threshold value for the meter to predict elevated glucose was set to >= 10 mmol/l. The correlation between the BGMD and the validated method was strong (R- 2 = 0. 89). For detecting ketoacidosis, the BGMD had a sensitivity of 1. 0 and specificity of 0. 73, when the threshold value was set to 2. 5 mmol/l. The urine <b>stick</b> <b>test</b> presented a sensitivity of 0. 89 and specificity of 0. 90 for detecting elevated VH glucose concentration. The sensitivity and specificity for the <b>stick</b> <b>test</b> to detect cases with possible ketoacidosis were 0. 84 and 0. 68, respectively. According to the results, BGMD can be reliably applied for sample screening, although more samples need to be analyzed for delineating the correct threshold values. In the case of glucose, the urine <b>stick</b> <b>tests</b> could be indicative in detecting cases with VH glucose >= 10 mmol/l. For predicting possible ketoacidosis with elevated VH total ketone bodies, the <b>stick</b> <b>test</b> is not reliable as the test presented both false-positive and -negative results.

40|$|Dynamic balance ability {{related to}} {{maintaining}} postural stability during movement is {{closely tied to}} fall risk in the elderly. The functional reach (FR) test has been developed to evaluate their dynamic balance. Although a simple and new FR test using an elastic stick has been proposed by modifying the above original FR test, the abilities related to both FR tests are judged to differ {{because of the large}} difference in the testing method. This study aimed to compare center of gravity fluctuation, muscle activity and functional reach distance as measured by the original FR test and the elastic <b>stick</b> FR <b>test.</b> First, reach distance, back/forth and right/left moving distance of the center of gravity, and activity of the lower leg muscles (soleus and tibialis anterior) were compared between both tests based on data obtained from 30 young male adults. All parameters except for the right/left moving distance were significantly larger in the elastic <b>stick</b> FR <b>test.</b> Next, the reach distance was examined in both FR tests using 53 elderly subjects; it was significantly longer in the elastic <b>stick</b> FR <b>test,</b> but showed no significant sex difference. The reach distance in both tests was significantly shorter (about 7 cm) in the elderly than in young adults. In conclusion, the elastic <b>stick</b> FR <b>test</b> involves greater leg muscle strength exertion and forward transferring of the center of gravity as compared with the original FR test. Because the elastic <b>stick</b> FR <b>test</b> relates largely to leg muscle function and equilibrium function, it may be more useful for evaluating the dynamic balance ability of the elderly. © 2007 Tohoku University Medical Press...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the changes in}} olfactory function in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who have received radiation to the head and neck. Materials and Methods: Olfactory function of consecutive patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma was assessed prospectively before irradiation and serially up to 1 year after radiotherapy by the Sniffin' Sticks (Erlangen, Germany) olfactory function test and by a patient symptom visual analogue scale. Results: Fifty-eight patients were recruited before radiotherapy was commenced. Three patients could not give a reliable response to the Sniffin' <b>Sticks</b> <b>test</b> even in this first assessment, and 7 patients did not return for evaluation after irradiation. Forty-eight patients were available for follow-up assessment. Mean olfactory threshold scores by the Sniffin' <b>Sticks</b> <b>test</b> were found to deteriorate significantly at 12 months {{when compared with the}} scores before irradiation (8. 3 at 12 months vs 11. 5 before irradiation; P =. 001). Scores for olfactory discrimination and for identification did not exhibit any significant changes when assessed at 12 months (P gt;. 05 for both). Subjective patient assessment of olfactory function with the visual analogue scale at 12 months did not demonstrate any significant differences when compared with patients' assessment before irradiation (P =. 90). An increase in discharge was the only nasal symptom that demonstrated a significant change at 12 months when compared with the assessment before irradiation (P lt; 001).

Materials and methods We have developed an extended version of the olfactory ID subtest of the Sniffin’ <b>Sticks</b> <b>test</b> battery to better assess the variability in ID scores and thereby olfactory abilities of healthy, adult individuals. Twenty-four odorants, corresponding cue labels, and distractor labels were added to the existing 16 -item Sniffin’ <b>Sticks</b> ID <b>test</b> to create the 40 -item Monell Extended Sniffin’ Sticks Identification Test (MONEX- 40). The MONEX- 40 was administered to 259 healthy young subjects, of which 72 were retested on an average of 212 days (SD 112 days) later. Results The added odor items demonstrated good validity, as shown by a significant correlation of the results with the original 16 -item ID test. In addition, the MONEX- 40 achieved a significant test–retest and split-half reliability. Conclusions Taken together, these results suggest that the MONEX- 40 is a reliable method for experimental assessment of odor ID ability in healthy, young individuals. Moreover, its use of a wider range of odors allows the experimenter to present subsets of the MONEX- 40 within the same experiment while maintaining statistical power...|$|R

Odor identification was evaluated in iRBD patients (n = 54), PD patients (n = 54) and healthy controls (n = 54). With the identification data, a brief odor identification test was established and then validated in other subjects. Odor identification scores in iRBD patients were significantly higher than those in PD patients (P< 0. 001) but lower than those in controls (P< 0. 001). At the cut-off value of 7. 5, the Sniffin' Sticks clearly differentiated iRBD and PD patients from the controls, and the brief test could increase the specificity in diagnosing PD. Neither the Sniffin' Sticks nor the brief test could clearly differentiate PD and iRBD patients from each other.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Moderate {{to severe}} {{traumatic}} brain injuries (TBIs) commonly lead to olfactory dysfunction; it is, however, unclear whether {{and to what}} degree mild TBI such as concussions, which are common sports injuries, affect olfactory function. We therefore aimed to evaluate smell function in athletes who sustained one or more sport concussions in a cross-sectional design. METHODS: Twenty-two University-level football players with one or multiple concussions and 13 control athletes without a history of concussion participated. We measured olfactory function by using the Sniffin' <b>Sticks</b> <b>test</b> to assess subjects' ability to discriminate and identify odors {{as well as their}} detection thresholds. In addition, we assessed odor intensity and pleasantness. RESULTS: We used number of concussions and time since the last concussion as independent variables and measure of olfactory function as dependent variables. Although we did not observe any significant effect of the number of concussions, athletes with a longer delay from time of concussion scored significantly weaker than more recently concussed subjects on the odor identification test and on an aggregate olfactory score. Accordingly, we observed a significant negative linear correlation between the odor identification score and the time elapsed since the last concussion.

Results The biopsies were carried out without any complications. All biopsies were positive for neurofilament, a marker for immature neurons. Substantial differences in the explants ability to attach to the culture plate occurred, with a rate of between 25 % and 100 %. The control showed 67 %. After stimulation with growth factors (FGF 2), the cultures with more attached cells showed neuronal differentiation with the appearance of bipolar cells. Conclusions The biopsy of the human olfactory epithelium is a minimally invasive procedure which can provide further information on specific changes and possible regenerative ability. Further studies with larger numbers of patients with different causes of an impaired sense of smell are needed to determine specific changes. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{correction}} to the density matrix used in density matrix renormalization group calculations {{to take into}} account the incompleteness of the environment block. The correction allows successful calculations using only a single site in the center of the system, rather than the standard two sites, improving typical computation times by a factor of two to four. In addition, in many cases where ordinary DMRG can get stuck in metastable configurations, the correction eliminates the <b>sticking.</b> We <b>test</b> the new method on the Heisenberg S= 1 chain.

40|$|Olfactory {{tests are}} an {{important}} tool in human nutritional research for studying food preferences, yet comprehensive tests dedicated solely to food odors are currently lacking. Therefore, within this study, an innovative food-associated olfactory test (FAOT) system was developed. The FAOT comprises 16 odorant pens that contain representative food odors relating to different macronutrient classes. The test underwent a sensory validation based on identification rate, intensity, hedonic value, and food association scores. The accuracy of the test was further compared {{to the accuracy of}} the established Sniffin’ <b>Sticks</b> identification <b>test.</b> The identification rates and intensities of this new FAOT were found to be comparable to the Sniffin’ <b>Sticks</b> olfactory identification <b>test.</b> The odorant pens were also assessed chemo-analytically and were found to be chemically stable for at least 24 weeks. Overall, this new identification test for use in assessing olfaction in a food-associated context is valid both in terms of its use in sensory perception studies and its chemical stability. The FOAT is particularly suited to examinations of the sense of smell regarding food odors...|$|R
