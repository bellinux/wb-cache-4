2500|$|A {{miniature}} <b>snap-action</b> <b>switch,</b> also trademarked {{and frequently}} {{known as a}} micro switch, is an electric switch that is actuated by very little physical force, {{through the use of}} a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes called an [...] "over-center" [...] mechanism. Common applications of micro switches include the door interlock on a microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending machines, and to detect paper jams or other faults in photocopiers. The miniature <b>snap-action</b> <b>switch</b> was invented in 1932 by Peter McGall, who was an employee of the Burgess Battery Company in Freeport, Illinois.|$|E

50|$|The first {{micro switch}} {{was invented by}} Phillip Kenneth McGall in 1932 in Freeport, Illinois, patent 1,960,020. McGall was an {{employee}} of the Burgess Battery Company at the time. In 1937 W.B. Schulte, McGall's employer, started the company MICRO SWITCH. The company and the Micro Switch trademark has been owned by Honeywell Sensing and Control since 1950. The trademark has become genericized for any <b>snap-action</b> <b>switch.</b> Companies other than Honeywell now manufacture miniature snap-action switches.|$|E
50|$|A common {{modification}} was {{to replace}} the <b>switches</b> with miniature <b>snap-action</b> <b>switches</b> (microswitches). Some of these, however, have the problem that their actuation is non-linear; they require considerable force to start moving compared to the force needed to complete the motion. When used in an otherwise unmodified CX40, this caused it {{to be more difficult}} to move along the diagonals, as one of the two switches being pushed would normally reach the threshold first, causing motion in that direction while the other was not yet pressed. In games that required fine control, like Jumpman, these solutions were generally unsuitable. Newer switches improve this action.|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} studies {{are made of}} small <b>snap-action</b> <b>switches</b> designed for use in thermostatic controls operating on a. c. at 240 volts r. m. s., 50 Hz. The performance of the silver cadmium oxide contacts (Ag. CdO, 85 / 15 %) is evaluated over a range of currents from 1 to 10 amps, for make and break operations. The arc at break {{is found to be}} the predominant factor contributing to the erosion of the contacts for the range of currents used. Tests using a high speed camera show that the energy dissipated in the arc between the contacts can be evaluated from equations describing the arc in terms of its voltage, current and length as functions of time. Subsequently work is carried out to develop the relation between arc energy and contact erosion, with specific regard to the distribution of energy between the two contact surfaces and the arc column. This is related to the power dissipation in the two electrode fall regions, and the resulting direction of net material transfer is thought to be influenced by the length achieved by the arc before extinction. Erosion is generally in the form of anodic loss and cathodic gain and the reasons for the directional bias in this type of switch are suggested. Ways of reducing the amount of erosion per operation by changing the switch opening characteristic are discussed and supported with experimental results. PETER J...|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} studies {{are made of}} a typical <b>snap-action</b> rocker <b>switch,</b> to establish the wear mechanisms in the pivoting contact. The rocker switch, used extensively in consumer goods, operates in the medium duty current range, (1 - 30 Amps). Highspeed photographic {{studies have shown that}} the main cause of wear is arcing, occurring during separation and bounce at the pivot contacts. To reduce the bounce a computer-based mathematical model of the system dynamics is developed and optimised; this results in recommended design changes. These changes are tested under full current endurance conditions, and show significant improvements in wear. The model of the switch dynamics relates the mathematics of motion to the bounce occuring at the pivot contact, without the influence of current. To show the effect of current and arcing, an automatic test system is developed for the controlled testing of electrical contacts. The system has the ability to evaluate arc energy, bounce times, and contact resistance. The results presented detail the influence of d. c current on contact bounce time, and identify the importance of the subsequent bounce time; which is defined for a single make operation, as the total duration of the bounces occurring after the first bounce. To compare the erosion profiles of the switch and test system, the system is operated under full load current endurance conditions, to evaluate wear. This comparison shows that the wear in the real switch contacts is greater, as result of the additional contact movement of slip and rolling. Arrow-Hart (Europe) Ltd, Plymouth, Devo...|$|R
50|$|A {{pressure}} switch for sensing fluid pressure contains a capsule, bellows, Bourdon tube, diaphragm or piston element that deforms or displaces proportionally to the applied pressure. The resulting motion is applied, {{either directly or}} through amplifying levers, {{to a set of}} switch contacts. Since pressure may be changing slowly and contacts should operate quickly, some kind of over-center mechanism such as a miniature <b>snap-action</b> <b>switch</b> is used to ensure quick operation of the contacts. One sensitive type of {{pressure switch}} uses mercury switches mounted on a Bourdon tube; the shifting weight of the mercury provides a useful over-center characteristic.|$|E
5000|$|Miniature <b>snap-action</b> <b>switch</b> may be {{used for}} example as {{components}} of such devices as photocopiers, computer printers, convertible tops or microwave ovens to ensure internal components are in the correct position for operation and to prevent operation when access doors are opened. A set of adjustable limit switches are installed on a garage door opener to shut off the motor when the door has reached the fully raised or fully lowered position. A numerical control machine such as a lathe will have limit switches to identify maximum limits for machine parts or to provide a known reference point for incremental motions.|$|E
5000|$|In 1945 {{he created}} the A. W. Haydon company [...] in Waterbury, Connecticut, {{producing}} timing motors and related devices. Haydon sold this company, {{and many of his}} patents, in 1951 to North American Philips for over $1,000,000. The A.W. Haydon Company was not dissolved, but was used to handle all sales of the new Division of Phillips. Haydon continued as chief executive of the new Phillips Division. At approximately the same time, Haydon formed a new company named [...] "Haydon Switch, Inc."

40|$|When {{exposed to}} tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a closely related death ligand and investigational therapeutic, cells enter a protracted period of variable duration {{in which only}} upstream initiator caspases are active. A subsequent and sudden transition marks activation of the downstream effector caspases that rapidly dismantle the cell. Thus, extrinsic apoptosis is controlled by an unusual variable-delay, <b>snap-action</b> <b>switch</b> that enforces an unambiguous choice between life and death. To understand how the extrinsic apoptosis switch functions in quantitative terms, we constructed a mathematical model based on a mass-action representation of known reaction pathways. The model was trained against experimental data obtained by live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting of cells perturbed by protein depletion and overexpression. The trained model accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, {{making it possible to}} study switching mechanisms in detail. Model analysis shows, and experiments confirm, that the duration of the delay prior to effector caspase activation is determined by initiator caspase- 8 activity and the rates of other reactions lying immediately downstream of the TRAIL receptor. Sudden activation of effector caspases is achieved downstream by reactions involved in permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and relocalization of proteins such as Smac. We find that the pattern of interactions among Bcl- 2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partne...|$|E
