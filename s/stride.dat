5|$|In 2010, one of {{the trains}} was re-themed to endorse <b>Stride</b> Gum. The train was wrapped in <b>Stride</b> Gum advertisements, showing a {{different}} flavor of <b>Stride</b> gum on each car. The advertisements remained on the train for the entire 2011 season, but were removed {{before the start of}} the 2012 season and replaced with Kia Soul advertising.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvement}} in running {{time and the}} wide broadcast of the race results provided a public demonstration of how the blade length affects performance. Pistorius' <b>stride</b> length was actually 9 percent longer (2.2m vs 2.0m), but Oliveira took more strides (99 vs 92). The combination of <b>stride</b> length and <b>stride</b> rate led to a clearly unusual performance with the longer blades. Pistorius' management {{issued a statement saying}} that Pistorius is always 1.84 meters tall, regardless of what prostheses he wears, and that the decision to maintain this height for his running blades was an issue of fairness.|$|E

5|$|Adhesion problems.

5000|$|William III <b>Strode</b> (1512-1579) of Newnham, {{who married}} Elizabeth Courtenay, heiress of Loughtor. He had by Elizabeth several sons and daughters, {{the eldest son}} and heir having been Richard V <b>Strode</b> (d.1581). The 6th son however was Rev. Sampson <b>Strode</b> (born 1552), rector of Dittisham, whose great-great-grandson was Richard <b>Strode</b> (1750-1790) of Boterford, who {{inherited}} the ancient estates of the senior Strodes on {{the failure of the}} male line of <b>Strode</b> of Newnham, following the death in 1767 of William <b>Strode</b> of Newnham. The 4th son was Philip <b>Strode</b> (d.1605) who married Wilmot Houghton, daughter of William Houghton of Houghton Towers, Lancaster, and was the father of William <b>Strode</b> (1602-1644), Doctor of Divinity and Public Orator of Oxford University, one of the Worthies of Devon of John Prince (d.1723), who called him [...] "this reverend divine, this rare poet, this charming orator".|$|R

50|$|The {{identity}} of the W. <b>Strode</b> imprisoned in 1628 and of the W. <b>Strode</b> impeached in 1642 has been questioned, but is now established. On the other hand, he is to be distinguished from Colonel William <b>Strode</b> (of Barrington), also parliamentarian and M.P., who died in 1666; and from William <b>Strode</b> (1602-1645), the orator, poet and dramatist.|$|R
5|$|Campaign school, Campagneschule or Campagne, {{where the}} horse learns {{collection}} and balance through all gaits, turns and maneuvers. The horse learns to shorten and lengthen his <b>stride,</b> perform lateral movements to the side, and is {{introduced to the}} more complex double bridle. This is the longest training phase and may take several years.|$|E
5|$|Spiders {{maintain}} balance when walking, so that legs 1 and 3 on {{one side}} and 2 and 4 on the other side are moving, while the other four legs are on the surface. To run faster, spiders increase their <b>stride</b> frequency.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{tension is}} the elastic {{tendency}} of a fluid surface {{which makes it}} acquire the least surface area possible. Surface tension allows insects (e.g. water striders), usually denser than water, to float and <b>stride</b> on a water surface.|$|E

5|$|Bolt was {{a member}} of the silver medal winning relay team with Asafa Powell, Marvin Anderson, and Nesta Carter in the 4×100 metres relay. Jamaica set a {{national}} record of 37.89 s. Bolt did not win any gold medals at the major tournaments in 2007, but Mills felt that Bolt's technique was much improved, pinpointing improvements in Bolt's balance at the turns over 200 m and an increase in his <b>stride</b> frequency, giving him more driving power on the track.|$|E
5|$|His {{breakthrough}} {{began in}} 2000, {{when he was}} voted Player of the Year by the Durham members, particularly for his one-day efforts. His form varied following a back injury, but he hit his <b>stride</b> in 2001, when he excelled both in the County Championship and in the one-day game. In the six English seasons from 2001, Collingwood has exceeded a batting average of 40 four times and achieved a bowling average of less than 40 on three occasions.|$|E
5|$|Most vertebrates—the amphibians, the {{reptiles}} {{and some}} mammals such as humans and bears—are plantigrade, {{walking on the}} whole of the underside of the foot. Many mammals, such as cats and dogs, are digitigrade, walking on their toes, the greater <b>stride</b> length allowing more speed. Digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement. Some animals such as horses are unguligrade, walking on the tips of their toes. This even further increases their <b>stride</b> length and thus their speed. A few mammals, namely the great apes, are also known to walk on their knuckles, at least for their front legs. Giant anteaters and platypuses are also knuckle-walkers. Some mammals are bipeds, using only two limbs for locomotion, which can be seen in, for example, humans and the great apes. Bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds, conserve more energy and have the ability to manipulate objects with their hands, which aids in foraging. Instead of walking, some bipeds hop, such as kangaroos and kangaroo rats.|$|E

5|$|Python has array {{index and}} array slicing {{expressions}} on lists, denoted as a, a or a. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are {{relative to the}} end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or <b>stride,</b> allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a returns {{a copy of the}} entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat's {{absence of}} major {{conformation}} flaws was important, as horses with well made limbs and feet {{are less likely}} to become injured. Secretariat's hindquarters were the main source of his power, with a sloped croup that extended the length of his femur. When in full <b>stride,</b> his hind legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.|$|E

5|$|The {{canonical}} five murders were perpetrated at night, on {{or close}} to a weekend, either {{at the end of}} a month or a week (or so) after. The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of <b>Stride,</b> whose attacker may have been interrupted. Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; and Kelly's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away, though only her heart was missing from the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|The forelimb {{bones of}} azhdarchids and ornithocheirids were unusually long {{compared}} to other pterosaurs, and, in azhdarchids, {{the bones of the}} arm and hand (metacarpals) were particularly elongated. Furthermore, as a whole, azhdarchid front limbs were proportioned similarly to fast-running ungulate mammals. Their hind limbs, on the other hand, were not built for speed, but they were long compared with most pterosaurs, and allowed for a long <b>stride</b> length. While azhdarchid pterosaurs probably could not run, they would have been relatively fast and energy efficient.|$|E
