60|$|Father Jerome {{had been}} very mild with Nina, but his {{mildness}} did not produce any corresponding feelings of gentleness in the breasts of Nina's relatives in the Windberg-gasse. Indeed, it had the contrary effect of instigating Madame Zamenoy and Lotta Luxa to new exertions. Nina, in her triumph, could not restrain herself from telling Souchey that Father Jerome did {{not by any means}} think so badly of her as did the others; and Souchey, partly in defence of Nina, and partly in quest of further <b>sound</b> <b>information</b> on the knotty religious difficulty involved, repeated it all to Lotta. Among them they succeeded in cutting Souchey's ground from under him as far as any defence of Nina was concerned, and they succeeded also in solving his religious doubts. Poor Souchey was at last convinced that the best service he could tender to his mistress was to save her from marrying the Jew, let the means by which this was to be done be, almost, what they might.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to draw {{attention}} to the definition of timbre as it pertains to the vowels of speech. There are two forms of size information in these “source-filter” <b>sounds,</b> <b>information</b> about the size of the excitation mechanism (the vocal folds), and information about the size of the resonators in the vocal tract that filter the excitation before it is projected into the air. The current definitions of pitch and timbre treat the two forms of size information differently. In this paper, we argue that the perception of speech sounds by humans suggests that the definition of timbre would be more useful if it grouped the size variables together and separated the pair of them from the remaining properties of these sounds. 11 page(s...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} in more detail the specific functions of the cochlear nuclei {{it is first necessary}} to understand the way <b>sound</b> <b>information</b> is represented by the fibers of the auditory nerve. Briefly, there are around 30,000 auditory nerve fibres in each of the two auditory nerves. Each fiber is an axon of a spiral ganglion cell that represents a particular frequency of sound, and a particular range of loudness. Information in each nerve fibre is represented by the rate of action potentials as well as the particular timing of individual action potentials. The particular physiology and morphology of each cochlear nucleus cell type enhances different aspects of <b>sound</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E
