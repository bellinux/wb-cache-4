40|$|Abstract]: Over {{the last}} decade, traffic volumes, tyre pressures, wheel loads and the {{percentage}} of heavy vehicles using the Australian road network has increased significantly. This has led to increased challenges for road designers to provide economical and durable pavement surfaces with adequate surface texture. A particular solution for improving surface texture on spray sealed surfaces is transverse variable spray rates (TVSR). In this technique bitumen spray-rates are varied across the lane width to account for the impact of traffic in the wheel-paths. This leads to designs where higher binder application rates are used on the shoulders and between the wheel-paths and lower rates in the wheel-paths. An extensive literature review has revealed very little quantitative data has been analysed to verify the technique is beneficial in providing roads with improved and more uniform surface texture. Undesirable surface texture issues generally consist of flushing or bleeding of bitumen in the wheel-paths, and <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregate</b> between the wheel-paths and on the shoulders. The Queensland Department of Main Roads collects annual survey data of their road network, including surface macro-texture data. This project aims to retrieve and compare survey data over a number of years, and collate it with other relevant data to verify if TVSR technology has provided an improvement in surface texture characteristics. Carefully selected road sections were studied to identify the effect of the TVSR technology when compared with similar areas sprayed with uniform single spray-rates. The study concluded that transverse variable spray rates were successful in increasing the transverse surface macro-texture uniformity of the analysed sections, and when used in conjunction with polymer modified binders, the surface macro-texture depth in the wheel-paths was increased also. Due to the limited scope of the study, further analysis would be required to verify the results across a wider area. ...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{dressing}} is a well-established, economical {{and effective}} method {{for maintaining the}} surface of roads. The object of surface treatment is to seal the existing road surface and to arrest disintegration of the road {{as well as to}} provide a comfortable surface to its users. In Sri Lanka most of the periodic maintenance of roads is done by using one of the surface dressings; sand sealing, single bitumen surface treatment (SBST) or double bitumen surface treatment (DBST). However, premature failures in the form of <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregate,</b> flushing of the surface, peeling off, patches, cracks and streaking along the surface are {{some of the problems that}} predominate in most of the local roads that are surfaced using SBST and DBST. As a result of these failures road maintenance cost increases and also cause inconveniences to the road users. Some attempts have been made over many years to minimize the above-mentioned defects and increase the life of surface dressings. However, economical and significant improvements have not been established. This research concentrates on developing improved standards for surface dressings that includes selection of material, application rates and necessary quality controlling which should be done in the laboratory and in the construction sites. This study focused on identifying the specific factors that will contribute to the failure of SBST and DBST from the design stage up to the construction stage. The properties of emulsions used for surface dressings were analysed using samples collected at the manufacturing units and construction sites. It was found that viscosity, of emulsion need to be improved and mix proportions need careful adjustments to achieve better results. A locally available, less expensive modifier and adhesive promoter were identified to improve the quality of the emulsion used for surface dressings. This modifier can incorporate to emulsion easily without any additional effort even at the construction sites. A formula to determine the rate of binder that suit the condition of the road surface and to the expected traffic level was derived depending on the percentage of bitumen in emulsion and the size of the aggregates used for different layers are known. Some new testing equipment that is economical and could be locally produced was devised to monitor the material properties and rate of applications at the construction sites. Field performance study using test sections was also done in order measure the effectiveness of the research findings. Finally an economic evaluation was also carried out to identify the benefits of the improvements proposed...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of wear resistant bituminous paving mixtures {{has been considered}} {{as one of the}} important problems in the field of bituminous pavement design in cold regions. In order to contribute to this problem, a series of laboratory tests used an accelerated wearing equipment were made on wearing resistance properties of bituminous mixtures: one is on the wearing process, another is on the effects of mixture components, including volume, size and gradation <b>of</b> coarse <b>aggregate</b> and types <b>of</b> binder. The findings of this study are: (1) wearing process of paving mixtures by a studded tire is composed of repetition of three actions, scarifying of asphalt mortar, attrition <b>of</b> coarse <b>aggregates,</b> and <b>stripping</b> out <b>of</b> <b>aggregates</b> from asphalt mortar bed; (2) wear resistance has a linear relation with volume percentage <b>of</b> coarse <b>aggregates,</b> although 5 ～ 2. 5 mm size in coarse aggregates appears to have adverse effects on the wearing resistance; (3) main function of modified asphalt is to resist the <b>stripping</b> out <b>of</b> coarse <b>aggregates</b> and its degree of contribution depends on the toughness and tenacity of asphalt. Based on these findings, an optimum aggregate gradation was proposed for the wear resistant bituminous paving mixture design...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} current {{literature}} {{on the effects of}} deicing salt and trace minerals, such as sulfate, on aggregate deterioration was conducted. Such deterioration in both Portland cement concrete, and bituminous pavements was reviewed. For Portland cement concrete, it was determined that current research on the effects of moisture and deicing salt on aggregates concrete matrix durability, with little discussion on the effects on <b>aggregates.</b> The effects <b>of</b> trace minerals in deicing salt are also rarely discussed. Pore size distribution, insoluble residue, absorption, and susceptibility to alkali-silica reaction all appear to affect aggregate durability in the presence of moisture of freeze-thaw. Based on available research, it is concluded that salt in solution exacerbates the damaging effects of moisture and freeze-thaw on aggregates. Several researchers currently are evaluating other features <b>of</b> <b>aggregate</b> deterioration by deicing salts. 	Moisture damage effects on aggregates in bituminous pavements have been widely studied. Damage potential is strongly related to the susceptibility <b>of</b> <b>stripping</b> <b>of</b> the bituminous covering from the aggregate surface. Research has been conducted on the use of various additives to reduce <b>stripping,</b> some <b>of</b> which consist of proprietary commercial formulations. There is also extensive research on testing procedures, which predict <b>stripping</b> potential <b>of</b> <b>aggregates.</b> However, the added effect of deicing salt has received relatively little attention. Some researchers have speculated that deicing salts may increase the brittleness of asphalt pavements thereby increasing susceptibility to moisture. Determining specific effects of deicing salts on aggregate may prove difficult because of the numerous properties that affect the <b>stripping</b> potential <b>of</b> <b>aggregates</b> for bituminous pavements. Mixture type, placement techniques and traffic, as well as aggregate properties, appear to be related to a bituminous pavement’s susceptibility to moisture damage...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{years before}} the Civil War a speculating land company bought a tract of 69000 acre on the slope of Shavers Mountain. Their tract fronted for about seven miles km along {{the eastern side of}} the mountain. To survey and mark their {{holdings}} the company hired a crew of men who must have found rough going in this wilderness. The crew did a good job, but its chief forgot one thing - the fact that a compass needle points to magnetic, not true north. In this area the angle of declination is about four degrees, a significant source of error on a seven-mile km front…. An experienced Virginia surveyor, in checking the data, discovered the error but said nothing about it. Presently, however, when the sale was being concluded and the deeds recorded, he brought the error to light, and under a sort of “doctrine of vacancy” claimed the wedge of land left by a corrected survey. His title was established, and he and his heirs found themselves owner <b>of</b> a seven-mile <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> forest, <b>aggregating</b> almost 900 acre. While timber above and below the wedge was cut, this narrow holding was undisturbed. Its thickest end, a fringe of tall spruces on the near horizon, is just east of Gaudineer Tower. From these trees came seed to produce a new forest, a happy result of a hundred-year-old mistake.|$|R

The modified Lottman test was used to distinguish between compacted mixes. In addition, the Swedish Rolling Bottle test, was also found to be effective in being able to distinguish between different asphalt-aggregates for stripping potential. Eleven anti-stripping liquid additives, lime and cement, in addition to two polymers, were evaluated for their ability to reduce/eliminate <b>stripping</b> potential <b>of</b> stripping-prone <b>aggregates.</b> It was found that EE- 2 Polymer, Portland cement, and their combination were effective with all aggregate sources...|$|R
