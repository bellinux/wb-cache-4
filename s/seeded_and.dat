From August 17 to 20 of that year, experiments were conducted in 11 clouds, of which six were <b>seeded</b> <b>and</b> five were controls.

5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} diurnal pattern of activity, feeding {{from dawn to}} dusk, {{stopping}} sporadically to rest and chew their cud. Ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of grasses, legumes and forbs. Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are <b>seeded</b> <b>and</b> improved intentionally to rough, native lands. Common plants toxic to sheep are present {{in most of the}} world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some oaks and acorns, tomato, yew, rhubarb, potato, and rhododendron.|$|E

40|$|Several factors {{decrease}} plant survival {{throughout their}} lifecycles. Among them, seed dis-persal limitation {{may play a}} major role by resulting in highly aggregated (contagious) <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> seedling distributions entailing increased mortality. The arrival of seeds, furthermore, may not match suitable environments for <b>seed</b> survival <b>and,</b> consequently, for seedling es-tablishment. In this study, we investigated spatio-temporal patterns of <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> seedling distribution in contrasting microhabitats (bamboo and non-bamboo stands) from the Brazil-ian Atlantic Forest. Spatial distribution patterns, spatial concordance between <b>seed</b> rain <b>and</b> seedling recruitment between subsequent years in two fruiting seasons (2004 – 2005 and 2007 – 2009), and the relation between <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> seedlings with environmental factors were examined within a spatially-explicit framework. Density and species richness of both <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> seedlings were randomly distributed in non-bamboo stands, but showed signifi-cant clustering in bamboo stands. <b>Seed</b> <b>and</b> seedling distributions showed across-year in-consistency, suggesting a marked spatial decoupling of the <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> seedling stages. Generalized linear mixed effects models indicated that only <b>seed</b> density <b>and</b> <b>seed</b> specie...|$|R
5|$|While {{out to sea}} in August of the 1965 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season, Stormfury meteorologists {{decided that}} Hurricane Betsy was {{a good candidate for}} seeding. However, the storm immediately swung towards land, and on September 1, the planned flights were canceled. For some reason, the press was not notified that there were no seedings, and several newspapers reported that it had begun. As Betsy passed close to the Bahamas and smashed into southern Florida, the public and Congress thought that seeding was underway and blamed Stormfury. It took two months for Stormfury officials to convince Congress that Betsy was not <b>seeded,</b> <b>and</b> the project was allowed to continue. A second candidate, Hurricane Elena, stayed too far out to sea.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States {{government}} {{attempted to}} weaken hurricanes through Project Stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver iodide. It {{was thought that}} the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds. The winds of Hurricane Debbie—a hurricane seeded in Project Stormfury—dropped as much as 31%, but Debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays. In an earlier episode in 1947, disaster struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville, Florida promptly changed its course after being <b>seeded,</b> <b>and</b> smashed into Savannah, Georgia. Because {{there was so much}} uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal government would not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10% chance of making landfall within 48 hours, greatly reducing the number of possible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes, casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts. Today, it is known that silver iodide seeding is not likely to have an effect because the amount of supercooled water in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.|$|E
