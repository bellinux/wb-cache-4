40|$|The {{transition}} {{structure is}} considered {{as the most}} important hydraulic structure controlling the w/s transtion, morever it decrease the <b>scouring</b> of <b>outlet</b> structure. seven experiment samples for transition structure was used in this research at different angles (10 ° - 90 °). It was shown that froud number has a clear effect on the depth of the scouring, morever the high discharge rates cause an increase of the ratio between the length of the scour and its depth. In order to select the best flaring angle it was shown that the angle of 40 ° has the most discharge rate, least structure length and least angle scour depth, with the firmly of the other factors affecting the <b>scouring</b> of <b>outlet</b> structure...|$|R

It's {{the only}} place in the world where you can party all night in Ancient Rome, be serenaded by a gondolier on the canals of Venice, and eat a lazy brunch at a {{sidewalk}} cafe in the shadow of the Eiffel tower. You can also bump into Superman on the way to dinner at Treasure Island and watch an erupting volcano at sunset. You can cruise 'The Strip' in a pink Cadillac and get married at midnight by an Elvis impersonator. You can shop for the most desired brands at exclusive boutiques, <b>scour</b> the factory <b>outlet</b> stores for a bargain, or snap up a tacky souvenir.

40|$|<b>Scour</b> at culvert <b>outlets</b> is a {{phenomenon}} encountered world-wide. Research into the problem has mainly been of an experimental nature, with equations being derived for particular circumstances. These traditional scour prediction equations, although offering the engineer some guidance on the likely magnitude of maximum scour depth, are applicable only to a limited range of situations. A model for the prediction of scouring that is generally applicable to all circumstances is not currently available. However, {{there is a substantial}} amount of data available from research over many years in this area. This paper compares current prediction equations with results obtained from two Artificial Neural Network models (ANN). The development of a basic feed forward artificial neural network trained by back-propagation to model scour downstream of culvert outlets is described. A supervised training algorithm is used with data collected from published studies and the authors’ own experimental work. The results show that the ANN can successfully predict the depth of scour with a greater accuracy than existing empirical formulae and over a wider range of conditions.

40|$|The stilling basins {{are used}} to {{dissipate}} the energy of flowing water and protect the downstream structures like spillways, canals, etc. from the scouring. The aim of the present experimental investigation is to design the new stilling basin models for non circular pipe outlet using intermediate sill of different shapes having height equal to the diameter of pipe outlet. The experimental study was carried out for three Froude numbers namely 3. 85, 2. 85 and 1. 85 for pipe <b>outlet.</b> <b>Scour</b> index (SI) {{has been used to}} evaluate the performance of stilling basin models with different shapes of intermediate sill, tested using same sand base material and test run time. The scour pattern was measured for each test run and flow pattern was also observed. After twelve tests runs, it was found that scour process were reduced for a shaped of intermediate sill having height equal to the diameter of pipe outlet at a particular location of intermediate sill combined with end sill of particular size and shape along with impact wall. Performance of this model having square shaped intermediate sill was found to be much better than USBR VI impact basin model for similar flow conditions...|$|R
