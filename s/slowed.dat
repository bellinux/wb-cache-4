40|$|The {{spontaneous}} electrical {{activities of}} circular muscle {{cells of the}} canine proximal colon were studied with intracellular micro-electrodes. All circular muscle cells exhibited <b>slow</b> waves at frequencies ranging between 2. 8 and 7. 0 cycles/min. The <b>slow</b> waves consisted of an upstroke phase followed by a plateau phase of variable duration (2 - 40 s). Many cells displayed a <b>slow</b> diastolic depolarization, or 'pre-potential' between <b>slow</b> waves. <b>Slow</b> waves spontaneously varied in duration and frequency in most preparations, creating distinctive <b>slow</b> wave patterns. Atropine, 2 X 10 (- 6) M, decreased the durations of <b>slow</b> waves in many preparations and often changed the pattern {{to a series of}} relatively uniform <b>slow</b> waves. A further reduction in mean <b>slow</b> wave duration was produced by additional treatment with tetrodotoxin, 10 (- 6) M. These results suggested that <b>slow</b> wave duration and pattern were affected by spontaneous discharge from both cholinergic and non-cholinergic excitatory nerves. Transmural nerve stimulation caused a short latency increase in <b>slow</b> wave duration (up to 38 s) that was abolished by atropine. In the presence of atropine, transmural stimulation evoked inhibitory junction potentials that reduced the amplitude and duration of the subsequent <b>slow</b> wave. The <b>slow</b> wave of reduced amplitude was followed by a <b>slow</b> wave of increased duration. The increase in duration of the <b>slow</b> wave {{did not appear to be}} related to the size of the preceding hyperpolarization, suggesting it was mediated by the release from non-cholinergic excitatory nerves. All responses to transmural stimulation were blocked by tetrodotoxin. Microejection of acetylcholine on to the muscle adjacent to the micro-electrode also produced an atropine-sensitive increase in <b>slow</b> wave duration. Tissues that had been stored in the cold overnight to reduce intrinsic neural activity exhibited regular <b>slow</b> waves of short duration. It is proposed that the basic myogenic pattern of spontaneous <b>slow</b> wave activity consists of regularly occurring <b>slow</b> waves of short duration (2 - 5 s). Intrinsic cholinergic and non-cholinergic excitatory nerves appear to modulate <b>slow</b> wave activity in vitro, producing distinctive <b>slow</b> wave patterns of variable instantaneous frequency and duration...|$|R

Along these subduction zones, a Tokai <b>slow</b> slip, a Kii channel <b>slow</b> slip, western to central Shikoku <b>slow</b> slips, Bungo <b>slow</b> slips, northern Miyazaki <b>slow</b> slips, and southern Miyazaki <b>slow</b> slips have been discovered (Fig.Â  1). The Tokai <b>slow</b> slip occurred between 2001 and 2005 (e.g., Ozawa et al. 2002, 2016). The Kii channel <b>slow</b> slip occurred from 1997 to 1998 (Kobayashi 2014). Western to central Shikoku <b>slow</b> slips occurred between 2004 and 2006 and between 2011 and 2013, following the Bungo <b>slow</b> slips (Takagi et al. 2016). The Bungo <b>slow</b> slips (Hirose et al. 1999) have occurred with a time interval of approximately 6 and 1 -year duration (e.g., Ozawa et al. 2013). The last Bungo event before the 2011 Tohoku earthquake occurred in 2010. The northern Miyazaki <b>slow</b> slip was first discovered by Yarai and Munekane (2015) and Nishimura and Ochi (2015) to have occurred between 2013 and 2014. After their discovery, GSI proposed that northern Miyazaki <b>slow</b> slip occurred in 1997 from GNSS data (GSI 2015). In the 1997 case, we could also observe aseismic slip in the northern Miyazaki area (Ozawa et al. 2001).

40|$|AbstractThe {{available}} pool {{of sodium}} channels, and thus cell excitability, is regulated by both fast and <b>slow</b> inactivation. In cardiac tissue, {{the requirement for}} sustained firing of long-duration action potentials suggests that <b>slow</b> inactivation in cardiac sodium channels may differ from <b>slow</b> inactivation in skeletal muscle sodium channels. To test this hypothesis, we used the macropatch technique to characterize <b>slow</b> inactivation in human cardiac sodium channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. <b>Slow</b> inactivation was isolated from fast inactivation kinetically (by selectively recovering channels from fast inactivation before measurement of <b>slow</b> inactivation) and structurally (by modification of fast inactivation by mutation of IFM 1488 QQQ). Time constants of <b>slow</b> inactivation in cardiac sodium channels were larger than previously reported for skeletal muscle sodium channels. In addition, steady-state <b>slow</b> inactivation was only 40 % complete in cardiac sodium channels, compared to 80 % in skeletal muscle channels. These results suggest that cardiac sodium channel <b>slow</b> inactivation is adapted for the sustained depolarizations found in normally functioning cardiac tissue. Complete <b>slow</b> inactivation in the fast inactivation modified IFM 1488 QQQ cardiac channel mutant suggests that this impairment of <b>slow</b> inactivation may result from an interaction between fast and <b>slow</b> inactivation...|$|R

40|$|When the {{velocity}} of capillary blood flow in the frog tongue declined to an intermediate range of 0. 2 â€“ 0. 7 mm/s, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve stimulation induced a biphasic <b>slow</b> depolarizing and <b>slow</b> hyperpolarizing potential (HP) in taste cells. The objective of this work {{was to examine the}} generative mechanisms of the biphasic <b>slow</b> potentials. The biphasic <b>slow</b> response was always preceded by a <b>slow</b> depolarizing potential (DP) component and followed by a <b>slow</b> HP component. Intravenous injection of tubocurarine completely blocked the biphasic <b>slow</b> responses, suggesting that both components of the biphasic <b>slow</b> potentials are evoked by the parasympathetic nerve (PSN) fibers. Membrane conductance of taste cells increased during <b>slow</b> DPs and decreased during <b>slow</b> HPs. The reversal potential of either component of a biphasic <b>slow</b> response was the almost same value of 12 mV. An antagonist, L- 703, 606, for neurotransmitter substance P neurokinin 1 receptor completely blocked both components of the biphasic <b>slow</b> responses. An antagonist, flufenamic acid, for nonselective cation channels on the taste cell membrane completely blocked the biphasic <b>slow</b> responses. These results suggest that PSN-induced biphasic <b>slow</b> responses are postsynaptically elicited in taste cells by releasing substance P at the PSN axon terminals. It is concluded that the <b>slow</b> DP componentmay be generated by opening one type of nonselective cation channel on taste cells and that the slowHP component may be generated by closing the other type of nonselective cation channel.
