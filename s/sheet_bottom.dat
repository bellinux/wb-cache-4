The bedmaps cover 3 regions: Russell glaciers, Umanaq glaciers and Jakobshavn glaciers of western Greenland. The covered areas is about 20 x 40 km(sup 2) for Russell glaciers and 300 x 100 sq km, and 100 x 80 sq km for Jakobshavn glaciers. The ground resolution is 50 meters {{and the average}} ice thickness accuracy is 10 to 20 meters. There are some void areas within the swath of the tracks in the bedmaps where the ice thickness is not known. Tomographic observations of these void areas indicate that the surface and shallow sub-surface pockets, likely filled with water, are highly reflective and greatly weaken the radar signal and reduce the energy reaching and reflected from the ice <b>sheet</b> <b>bottom...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractBasic {{property}} of fabricated structures is stiffness and flexural modulus. Now a day's composite structures are replacing the solid structures {{due to their}} improved properties. Use of composites is more challenging, since the materials are less predictable. Composites are brittle not ductile failure. Structural health monitoring and non-destructive inspection of composites {{is much more difficult}} than for metals as the damage in composites are complex (Fiber cracks, matrix cracks, interface deboning, delamination, micro buckling etc.). To overcome the major drawback of composites, spot welded panels are used. Based on the analysis, panel structure parameters considered are Thickness of the sheet, Core height, Core shape, Panel size, Weld layout and Material constituents of panel face <b>sheet,</b> <b>bottom</b> sheet and core. The parameters are analyzed by Taguchi design of experiments by considering orthogonal array of L 16. The main aim is to optimize the panel dimensions on flexural modulus of a fabricated metallic panel, using Finite Element Analysis. The problem is modelled in ANSYS and the flexural modulus is evaluated in the transverse direction by three point bending test (ASTM D 790). The optimum dimensions of the panel for three point bending is tested and evaluated by Taguchi Analysis. The results show that the proposed approach can find optimal dimensions considering both better and more robust design...|$|E
40|$|The work aims to {{investigate}} the geomorphological and sedimentological aspects of Union Glacier area (79 ° 45 ’ 00 ’’S; 82 ° 30 ’ 00 ’’W), southern sector of Ellsworth Mountains. Geomorphological cartography based on 15 m ASTER (2010) satellite imagery and field works were carried out during the Brazilian expedition (2011 / 2012) enabled the identification of morainic formations: ice-cored hummock moraines, supraglacial moraines, and recession moraines {{in the interior of}} the valleys. With the exception of the latter one, all types of moraines have been developed on the blue-ice areas. The evidence for paleo wet-based glacial conditions is reconstructed from a range of geomorphological record, including exposed abrasion marks, striations and glaciotectonic deformation. This type of deformation is represented by lee sides of oversteepening bedrock promontories which follow the tributaries of glaciers ice flow. Glacial sediments were collected from the moraines for granulometric and morphometric analyses. They show the prevalence of sandy gravel and sand texture, low quantity of fine fractions, and absence of attributes such as striated and faceted clasts, which indicate, on the other side, low-sediment transport capacity from the ice <b>sheet</b> <b>bottom.</b> It is inferred that the moraine debris are originated from local sources. Weathering action and constant katabatic winds are possibly the major agents of transport and alteration of the exposed sediments.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a free-surface slender two-dimensional stream (liquid sheet) issuing from a nozzle in the gravitational field in still air, under {{the effect of}} surface-active agents, are analysed experimentally. The particular test section geometry (the liquid is forced to assume a bidimensional form between two vertical guides and a horizontal plate placed at a certain variable distance from the nozzle exit section) employed in this study gives rise to various flow regimes depending on the governing parameters: liquid flow rate, sheet height, surface pressure, gravity. Two basic phenomena are observed: thinning of the sheet (with recirculating motion inside it) and sheet-threadlines transition. For a certain surfactant (bulk) concentration, there exists a minimum critical flow rate value for which the sheet is seen to thin starting at both of the <b>sheet</b> <b>bottom</b> corners. A ridge, usually {{referred to as a}} Reynolds ridge in the literature, separates the sheet from the thin-film regions. The thin films exhibit recirculating flows (caused by the onset of surfactant-induced surface-pressure-driven convection in the gravitational field) and extend to the entire rectangular interface as the flow rate is reduced. At zero flow rate the thinned sheet resembles a plane vertical soap him showing a recirculating cellular structure. These phenomena are linked to the presence of surface-active material adsorbed at the liquid-air interface and occur when the sheet height exceeds a critical value. Otherwise, at a critical flow rate value the liquid sheet breaks up into an array of (more or less regularly distributed) discrete threadlines (vertical jets), whose spacing depends on the surface tension of the test liquid...|$|E
40|$|More than 150 {{subglacial}} lakes {{have been}} discovered in Antarctica so far. Due to obvious challenges with exploration, numerical modelling {{remains one of the}} major tools to acquire information about those hard-to-access objects. Until now only the huge Lake Vostok has been investigated in detail. This paper focuses on Lake Concordia - the second largest subglacial lake in Antarctica over which substantialgeophysical data has been collected. This lake is covered by about 4000 m ice and is located near Dome C. In order to apply numerical models to the hard-to-access Antarctic subglacial lakes, decent geometries and boundary conditions are required. In this study we present the results of airborne gravity inversion, suggesting that this lake has an area of 617 km^ 2, a volume of 31 km^ 3, and a maximum water columnthickness of 126 m. This bathymetry is used as geometry input for an established 3 D-numerical lake-flow model to simulate the circulation and basal mass balance. Compared to our model studies of subglacial Lake Vostok, we obtain a general circulation pattern that is significantly weaker (due to the smaller size of the lake) and of reversed orientation (due to the reversed ice surface tilt). The modelled mean horizontal and vertical velocities are in the order of 0. 2 mm/s and 0. 5 &# 956;m/s, respectively. The larger molecular convective velocity estimations (1. 35 ± 0. 13 mm/s and 0. 81 ± 0. 08 mm/s) are similar to Lake Vostoks. The modelled average melting and freezing rates are 4. 3 ± 1. 1 mm/a and 1. 1 ± 0. 3 mm/a, respectively, and the corresponding fresh water gain is 58 ± 27 dm^ 3 /s. Integration of the modelled freezing and melting along prescribed ice flow lines allows us to calculate the distribution and thickness of accreted ice at the ice <b>sheet</b> <b>bottom.</b> We estimate a volume of 2. 6 ± 2. 0 km^ 3 (8. 3 ± 8. 2 % of the total lake volume) occupying the north-eastern corner of the lake covering an area of 159 ± 48 km^ 2 (26 ± 9 % of the total lake area).

40|$|Self-Piercing Riveting (SPR) is a {{high-speed}} mechanical fastening technique {{which does not}} require pre-drilling. During SPR, a tubular rivet is driven through the top <b>sheet,</b> piercing the <b>bottom</b> <b>sheet</b> without breaking through it, accompanied by flaring of the legs in the <b>bottom</b> <b>sheet</b> {{under the guidance of}} a suitable die. The rivet material should have adequate hardness to pierce the sheets, and sufficient ductility to deform in the <b>bottom</b> <b>sheet</b> without cracking, thus producing a mechanical interlock between the sheets. An increase in strength or thickness of the ply materials narrows down the operating window in terms of joint quality and performance. It is important to know the residual stress distribution arising from the riveting process, and its dependence on the ply materials properties. to ensure a sound joint. In this study, four different joints consisting of two different hardnesses of materials and two different hardnesses of rivets were examined. Residual stresses were measured on the strain scanner Kowari at ANSTO at selected critical locations. The study revealed that the hardness of the rivet and a ply material influence the magnitude and distribution of compressive residual stress in the rivet joint. It was observed that the maximum compressive residual stress occurred in the rivet leg in the transverse direction relative to plane of sheet. The challenges related to the application of neutron diffraction technique to the measurements of residual stress in the riveted joints are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Most of {{the fatigue}} damage in {{aircraft}} structures {{can be linked}} to the stress concentration arising at the rivet joints. Interference-fit riveting of a flush rivet can form the uniform interference fit. Thanks to the uniform interference fit, large stress concentration can be avoided. The radial deformation, which is directly relative to interference fit, is therefore of prime importance. Parameters associated with a riveting process that directly affect the quality of rivets {{must be taken into account}} to observe the effect on radial deformation at rivet holes. This paper presents an effective variation analysis to calculate radial deformation at rivet holes by assuming that the axial stresses are constant both along the axial and radius of the rivet slug. Firstly, the rivet process model is built before variation analysis. Secondly, theoretical relationships between radial deformations and contact loads are proposed using elasto-plastic analysis. Later, the expressions of the contact loads are given according to geometrical relationships and analysis of deforming forces. Thirdly, an instance made up of the rivet, top <b>sheet</b> and <b>bottom</b> <b>sheet</b> is used to verify the analysis model. The model paves an efficient way to study the deforming law of the riveting press process and build the pre-estimate model of the rivet deformations and the parameter optimization model...|$|R
