5|$|<b>Shunt</b> surgery, usually {{performed}} by neurosurgeons, involves {{the creation of}} a conduit by which CSF can be drained into another body cavity. The initial procedure is usually a lumboperitoneal (LP) <b>shunt,</b> which connects the subarachnoid space in the lumbar spine with the peritoneal cavity. Generally, a pressure valve is included in the circuit to avoid excessive drainage when the patient is erect. LP shunting provides long-term relief in about half the cases; others require revision of the <b>shunt,</b> often on more than one occasion—usually due to <b>shunt</b> obstruction. If the lumboperitoneal <b>shunt</b> needs repeated revisions, a ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal <b>shunt</b> may be considered. These shunts are inserted in one of the lateral ventricles of the brain, usually by stereotactic surgery, and then connected either to the right atrium of the heart or the peritoneal cavity, respectively. Given the reduced need for revisions in ventricular shunts, it is possible that this procedure will become the first-line type of <b>shunt</b> treatment.|$|E
5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension {{is a condition}} of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, double vision, difficulties seeing, and a swollen optic disc. It can occur {{in association with the}} use of Vitamin A and tetracycline antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger obese women. Management may include ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a <b>shunt</b> such as a ventriculoperitoneal <b>shunt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other liver-related {{complications}} (portal hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) {{are treated}} with the same modalities as used in cirrhosis, although the use of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic <b>shunt</b> treatment is discouraged {{due to the lack}} of documented benefit.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>shunting</b> sign (入換標識, irekae hyōshiki or—more briefly—入標, irehyō) {{is not a}} signal; therefore, its {{diagonal}} indicator is not [...] "go" [...] but [...] "open" [...] (開通, kaitsū). A <b>shunting</b> sign {{does not}} have a protected section. A <b>shunting</b> signal is absolute, but a <b>shunting</b> sign is a permissive. A train may pass a <b>shunting</b> sign reading [...] "stop" [...] only if the train is accompanied by a <b>shunting</b> staff; its locomotive displays a <b>shunting</b> car sign (入換動力車標識, irekae douryokusha hyōshiki)—a single red light at both ends—at night. In some systems, shunting-signal identification signs are omitted; instead, a <b>shunting</b> sign uses purple (instead of white) lights in a <b>shunting</b> signal.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the solar cell can be degraded drastically by the <b>shunts,</b> {{some of which were}} originated from silicon material, but the most important <b>shunts</b> were induced by process. The simple measurement which can image the <b>shunts</b> directly was described by using the temperature sensitive liquid crystal sheet.

30|$|The {{operation}} of the shuttle train is quite efficient {{as it is a}} full train loaded with 80 TEUs and doesn’t need any <b>shunting</b> processes between Rotterdam and Basel. The SWL transport includes the transfer of the wagon from the hinterland terminal to the <b>shunting</b> yard, the <b>shunting</b> process within the <b>shunting</b> yard, the train from the <b>shunting</b> yard to the regional <b>shunting</b> point, the <b>shunting</b> at the regional <b>shunting</b> point and the distribution and delivery of the wagons to the final recipients’ sidings. Here the trains are comparably short (10 to 30 wagons) and the sidings are served individually wagon by wagon.|$|R
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, stubs {{lend themselves}} to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs {{in the body of the}} filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of <b>shunt</b> anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and <b>shunt</b> anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|E

A shunting of blood from the thigh veins back into the lower leg veins will give a reflux situation. The veins most often found to be incompetent are the saphenous veins and the perforators communicating with the deep veins of the thigh.|$|E
5|$|Coal was {{transported by}} canal and a railway {{connection}} to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Beswick branch built in the early 1900s, {{but most of it}} was used locally, transported by road using horse and carts and motor lorries, much of it destined for the adjacent Bradford Ironworks. The company bought a 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotive, Bradford, from the Avonside Engine Company of Bristol in 1928 to <b>shunt</b> wagons to the colliery siding.|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of dissipating mechanical energy with piezoelectric material <b>shunted</b> with passive electrical circuits is investigated. The effective mechanical impedance for the piezoelectric element <b>shunted</b> by an arbitrary circuit is derived. The <b>shunted</b> piezoelectric {{is shown to}} possess frequency dependent stiffness and loss factor which are also dependent on the <b>shunting</b> circuit. The generally <b>shunted</b> model is specialized for two <b>shunting</b> circuits: {{the case of a}} resistor alone and that of a resistor and inductor. For resistive <b>shunting,</b> the material properties exhibit frequency dependence similar to viscoelastic materials, but are much stiffer and more independent of temperature. <b>Shunting</b> with a resistor and inductor introduces an electrical resonance, which can be optimally tuned to structural resonances in a manner analogous to a mechanical vibration arsorber. Techniques for analyzing systems which incorporate these <b>shunting</b> cases are presented and applied to a cantilevered beam experiment. The experimental results for both the resistive and resonant <b>shunting</b> circuits validate the <b>shunted</b> piezoelectric damping models...|$|R

40|$|Arteriovenous <b>shunting</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is a recognized contraindication to treatment by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. This study aims to determine the prevalence of arteriovenous <b>shunting</b> in patients presenting with HCC and the development of <b>shunts</b> in those with inoperable HCC being treated with repeated chemoembolization. In a group of 292 Chinese patients (251 men, 41 women; mean age 54. 7 years) presenting with HCC, hepatic angiograms demonstrated arteriovenous <b>shunting</b> in 91 cases (31. 2 %); <b>shunting</b> into the portal vein was observed in 84 (28. 8 %) and <b>shunting</b> into the hepatic vein in seven (2. 4 %). The hepatic angiograms of a separate group of 171 Chinese patients (144 men, 27 women: mean age 55. 4 years) undergoing chemoembolization for inoperable HCC were analysed. Arteriovenous <b>shunting</b> developed during treatment in 20 patients (11. 7 %). Of these 20 patients, one had <b>shunting</b> into the hepatic vein while 19 (11. 1 %) had arterioportal <b>shunting.</b> Arteriovenous <b>shunting</b> occurred through the tumour or portal vein tumour thrombus in 13 patients, and occurred at sites remote from the tumour in the other seven patients. <b>Shunting</b> disappeared on repeat angiograms in three patients. Various postulated mechanisms responsible for arteriovenous <b>shunting</b> in HCC are reviewed. The recognition of development of arteriovenous <b>shunting</b> during chemoembolization of HCC is important as it has a direct bearing on patient management and prognosis...|$|R
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{may also}} occur after {{the creation of}} a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic <b>shunt</b> (TIPS). This is used in the treatment of refractory ascites, bleeding from oesophageal varices and hepatorenal syndrome. TIPS-related encephalopathy occurs in about 30% of cases, with the risk being higher in those with previous episodes of encephalopathy, higher age, female sex and liver disease due to causes other than alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. Hydrocephalus can occur because {{of obstruction of}} the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality. Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking. In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of the}} skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a <b>shunt,</b> which diverts fluid {{to another part of the}} body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal <b>shunt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a <b>shunt</b> or have a contraindication for <b>shunt</b> surgery.|$|E

In the final step, the total trip costs for a single container were calculated by adding the costs for all transport segments. In rail transport, each <b>shunting</b> process was considered as a new transport segment (the <b>shunting</b> segments consisted of: collection: siding -> <b>shunting</b> yard; mainline operation: <b>shunting</b> yard -> <b>shunting</b> yard; distribution: <b>shunting</b> yard -> siding).|$|R
5|$|<b>Shunt</b> {{surgery was}} {{introduced}} in 1949; initially, ventriculoperitoneal shunts were used. In 1971, good results were reported with lumboperitoneal shunting. Negative reports on shunting in the 1980s led to a brief period (1988–1993) during which optic nerve fenestration (which had initially been described in an unrelated condition in 1871) was more popular. Since then, shunting is recommended predominantly, with occasional exceptions.|$|E
5|$|Treatment is with {{anticoagulants}} (medication that suppresses blood clotting), {{and rarely}} thrombolysis (enzymatic {{destruction of the}} blood clot). Given that there is usually an underlying cause for the disease, tests may be performed to look for these.

They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and {{are one of the most}} important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments. The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth, in a process known as the viral <b>shunt.</b> Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean.|$|E

5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they <b>shunt</b> flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{considers}} the topology of coupled tuned circuits to involve a separate approximation technique to the insertion-loss method, but also producing nominally flat passbands and high attenuation stopbands. The most common topology for these is <b>shunt</b> anti-resonators coupled by series capacitors, less commonly, by inductors, {{or in the}} case of a two-section filter, by mutual inductance. These are most useful where the design requirement is not too stringent, that is, moderate bandwidth, roll-off and passband ripple.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus (obstruction of {{the flow}} of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid) may complicate SAH in both the short and long term. It is detected on CT scanning, on which there is enlargement of the lateral ventricles. If the level of consciousness is decreased, drainage of the excess fluid is performed by therapeutic lumbar puncture, extraventricular drain (a temporary device inserted into one of the ventricles), or occasionally a permanent <b>shunt.</b> Relief of hydrocephalus can lead to an enormous improvement in a person's condition. Fluctuations in blood pressure and electrolyte imbalance, as well as pneumonia and cardiac decompensation occur in about half the hospitalized persons with SAH and may worsen prognosis. Seizures occur during the hospital stay in about a third of cases.|$|E
