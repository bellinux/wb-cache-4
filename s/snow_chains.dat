5|$|Modern winter service {{vehicles}} will usually {{also have a}} satellite navigation system connected to a weather forecast feed, allowing the driver to choose the best areas to treat and to avoid areas in which rain is likely, which can wash away the grit used—the most advanced can even adapt to changing conditions, ensuring optimal gritter and plow settings. Most run on wheels, often with <b>snow</b> <b>chains</b> or studded tires, but some are mounted on caterpillar tracks, with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards {{the side of the}} road. Off-road winter {{service vehicles}} mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as snowcats. Snowcats are commonly fitted with snowplows or snow groomers, and are used by ski resorts to smooth and maintain pistes and snowmobile runs, although they can also be used as a replacement for chairlifts.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, a tug {{ground unit}} {{properly}} equipped with <b>snow</b> <b>chains</b> {{was used to}} push the aircraft back from the gate. After leaving the gate, the aircraft waited in a taxi line with many other aircraft for 49 minutes before reaching the takeoff runway. The pilot apparently decided not {{to return to the}} gate for reapplication of deicing, fearing that the flight's departure would be even further delayed. More snow and ice accumulated on the wings during that period, and the crew was aware of that fact when they decided to make the takeoff. Heavy snow was falling during their takeoff roll at 3:59p.m. EST.|$|E

2500|$|Even on mainlands, some {{settlements}} have no roads {{connecting with}} the primary continental network, due to natural obstacles like mountains or wetlands, remoteness, or general expense.

2500|$|While Connecticut {{was one of}} {{the hardest}} hit areas, the state was well-prepared for the storm and managed to avoid major problems. Hartford {{received}} a total of 21.9inches (55cm) of snow — the second largest snowfall since 1906. A total of 18inches (46cm) fell in the small Sandy Hook village. West Hartford totaled 27inches (69cm) and Fairfield saw 27.8inches (70.6cm) of snow. Despite the large amounts of snow, there were only isolated individual power outages. [...] At the storm's onset, governor M. Jodi Rell ordered all tractor-trailer trucks off the state's highways to facilitate the efforts of highway crews with snow removal. [...] Motorists whose vehicles were not equipped with 4-wheel drive were required to use <b>snow</b> <b>chains</b> to travel on state roadways during the storm. [...] Connecticut mobilized 2,500 state-owned and privately contracted snowplows to keep state highways open during the storm. [...] The state's 169 cities and towns employed hundreds of additional plows to keep local roads passable. [...] Bradley International Airport was closed for several hours, and the storm disrupted service on Metro North.|$|E

50|$|The trolley buses were short-lived, however, mostly {{owing to}} their {{vulnerability}} to weather: rain caused {{problems with the}} overhead power supply, and <b>snow</b> required tire <b>chains</b> to be installed on vehicles {{in order to maintain}} traction.|$|R
5000|$|An {{example is}} {{lubricating}} oil for four-stroke or four-cycle internal combustion engines {{such as those}} used in portable electricity generators and [...] "walk behind" [...] lawn mowers.

50|$|Although the bar grip {{performs}} well as {{a pattern}} for severe mud, and is acceptable for most off-road surfaces, its lack of a small tread pattern makes it poor at clearing water.

50|$|Materials include steel (in {{the form}} of links or cables), polyurethane, rubber, and fabric. The original-style steel-link chains are also {{available}} {{in a variety of}} carbon steel and steel alloys and link shapes. Link shapes include standard, twisted, square, and reinforced. The shape of the links changes the flexibility, grip, and strength of the chain. The links can also have added studs or V-bars for an even more aggressive traction. The use of alloy steel and hardened steel adds durability. Traction cables (cable <b>chains,</b> <b>snow</b> cables) attach like chains but are made from cable rather than chain.|$|R

40|$|The {{number and}} the size of linked open data graphs keep growing at a fast pace and confronts {{semantic}} RDF services with problems characterized as Big data.

40|$|Psychrophiles are {{organisms that}} grow optimally below 20 C (1). The US Great Basin {{is home to}} many {{mountain}} peaks {{with an abundance of}} alpine snow environments perfect for psychrophilic habitation. We analyzed samples from three different locations, Wheeler Peak, Pacific Crest Trail, and Mount Conness, characterizing and comparing the psychrophilic communities at varying depth intervals in the <b>snow.</b> Polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed no notable difference in community structure with depth, but there was a distinct difference when comparing different snow environments (i. e. shaded vs. full sun exposure). The chlorophyll concentration decreased as the depth of the snow increased. By creating a clone library and utilizing DNA sequencing technology we were able to obtain 16 S and 18 S rRNA gene sequences from samples collected from Mount Conness, which allowed us to identify microbes living in the ecosystem. This information enabled us to produce bacterial and eukaryl phylogenetic trees, giving us a clear look into the diversity of this psychrophilic community. Out of seventy bacterial results there were fifty‐three ‐Proteobacteria, thirteen Sphingobacteria, and only three Actinobacteria, with one unclassified bacteria as well. These results will guide us in our future plans for experimentation...|$|R

Abstract: In several ski resorts, we have {{distributed}} a tool named Astral. Every days, {{this software}} calculates an Euclidean distance and correlation with past days, {{in order to}} select ten analogous days by a nearest neighbour approach (see Bois 75 and Buser 89). The input variables are: temperatur~, daily at;nount of fres. h r~cent snow and water equivalent, sum of temperature at 13 hour above zero threshold, wmd velOCIty, [...] A pnncIpal component analysis is done on these raw variables {{in order to have}} a data reduction and almost to obtain independent variables before the analogous step. The outputs are the raw variables concerning the ten selected analogous days and the corresponding observed avalanche activity. A notable insufficiency of this present tool is that no internal variable of snow pack is used to detefllline analogous days. This is due to the lack of daily observed snow pits. To avoid this default, a new inIprovement is to use results of the operational <b>snow</b> modelling <b>chain</b> Safran (weather analysis) Crocus (snow analysis) Mepra (stability analysis). We add new variables for a better characterisation ofthe snow pack and its stability. Our ainI is afterwards to use the data from La Plague resort to validate the result of this approach...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the fifties}} was Moto Guzzi of the Italian Ministry of Defence's request to develop a special vehicle for the [...] "Alpini" [...] (mountain troops). Who transported at that time their {{material}} yet with donkeys [...] It was suggested General Garbari as project officer and formulated a number of requirements which the vehicle had to meet: it needed to move a load of 500 kg through all kinds of terrain, especially in mountainous areas and on very narrow paths. The development was first placed in the hands of Antonio Micucci and later worked on by Soldavini and Giulio Cesare Carcano [...] Carcano had just a new long mounted V-twin engine with forced air cooling developed, where the directors of Moto Guzzi bread saw. There was a 500 and a 650 cc version that was intended for the Fiat 500, but Fiat withdrew from the project. Carcano saw his chance to still find a use for his new engine. The [...] "Mulo Meccanico" [...] (Mechanical Donkey) was a very special machine with wheel drive and variable wheelbase and track width [...] The 754 cc engine produced just 20 hp, due to the low compression ratio that, taking into account fuel of low quality, was necessary. The couple, however, of 47 Nm was achieved at 2,400 rpm. There was only one 26mm Weber carburettor used and the machine had a waterproof coil - ignition [...] There was a chassis system which consisted of tubes and pressed steel box sections. The rear suspension consisted of two box girder arms that were cushioned by rubber suspension. At the front was a one-sided telescopic fork with coil springs [...] The control was done with a steering wheel through bevel gears. The driver sat on a motorcycle seat, but the operation was done through levers and pedals as in a car [...] The engine was sitting behind the driver. Behind it was a manual gearbox with six forward gears and one reverse. There was a central differential with a teruglooppal to prevent roll back. 20% of the drive went to the front wheel, 80% to the rear wheels. The rear-wheel drive was done with two drive shafts that went diagonally from the differential to the two wheels, the front-wheel drive through a propeller shaft leading from the differential between the cylinders through to the steering head went. Using three bevel gears, the drive was at the steering led to another drive shaft, which powered the front wheel. In one cabinet aluminum were located both the gearbox, the differential and the device to adjust the track width. That could happen driving: a distance of about 25 with the gauge could be changed from 1300 mm to 850 mm or vice versa, but in an emergency that could still happen. The drum brakes were behind hydraulic operated, the drum brake at the front {{with the aid of a}} Bowden cable [...] Behind the rear wheels were tensioning rollers, leaving a short caterpillar could be mounted. The front fender left enough space for a <b>snow</b> <b>chain</b> [...] However Autoveicolo da Montagna did not meet expectations. As long as there was straight drove the machine could take the most improbable slopes, but sideways was always the danger of falling over, because there were only three wheels. On the mountain trails were very short turns or rocks enough to stop the mechanical donkey while a real donkey did not experience any problems here. Therefore, the Autoveicolo da Montagna was already taken out of production in 1963.|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of sea ice mass balance processes requires continuous {{monitoring of the}} seasonal evolution of the ice thickness. While autonomous ice mass balance buoys (IMB buoys) deployed {{over the past two}} decades have contributed to our {{understanding of}} ice growth and decay processes, deployment has been limited, in part, by the cost of such systems. Routine, basin-wide monitoring of the ice cover is realistically achievable through a network of reliable and affordable autonomous instrumentation. We describe the development of a novel autonomous platform and sensor that replaces the traditional thermistors string for monitoring temperature profiles in the ice and <b>snow</b> using a <b>chain</b> of inexpensive digital temperature chip sensors linked by a single-wire data bus. By incorporating a heating element on each sensor, the instrument is capable of resolving material interfaces (e. g. air-snow and ice-ocean boundaries) even under isothermal conditions. The instrument is small, low-cost and easy to deploy. Field and laboratory tests of the sensor chain demonstrate that the technology can reliably resolve material boundaries to within a few centimetres. The discrimination between different media based on sensor thermal response is weak in some deployments and efforts to optimise the performance continue...|$|R
