5|$|The 98%-ish {{complete}} beta and {{an earlier}} version were eventually leaked and made playable. Soon afterward, an unofficial restoration effort known as Chrono Trigger: Flames of Eternity became popular and aimed to fully complete the game's development, switching from using the earlier version as a base to the latest released version. While it received heavy criticism from the first developers and a very mixed reaction from the fan base for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes,</b> it nonetheless is the most stable version {{of the game and}} is under active development.|$|E
5|$|The {{general layout}} of the home's {{interior}} has remained basically the same throughout the remodelings; the rooms on each floor are accessed via a large central hallway which ends in an elegant rotunda. However, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> made in 1910 and 1911 did alter the interior appearance. The parlor was converted into the library and the library was converted {{into the dining room}} after an extension was added on. In the home's northwest corner a large kitchen was added, on the second-floor, the room above the kitchen became servant's quarters.|$|E
5|$|Modulation {{of neural}} {{responses}} may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with {{an important aspect of}} consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić {{it has been shown that}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony. An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas. This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.|$|E

5|$|The Sejm, until 1573 {{summoned by}} the king at his {{discretion}} (for example when he needed funds to wage a war), composed of the two chambers presided over by the monarch, became {{in the course of}} the 16th century the main organ of the state power. The reform-minded execution movement had its chance to take on the magnates and the church hierarchy (and take steps to restrain their abuse of power and wealth) when Sigismund Augustus switched sides and lent them his support at the sejm of 1562. During this and several more sessions of parliament, within the next decade or so, the Reformation inspired szlachta was able to push through a variety of reforms, which resulted in a fiscally more sound, better governed, more centralized and territorially unified Polish state. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> were too modest, other had never become completely implemented (e. g. recovery of the usurped Crown land), but nevertheless for the time being the middle szlachta movement was victorious.|$|E

25|$|While {{environmental}} factors are significantly responsible for evolutionary change, they act merely as agents for natural selection. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> develop through interactions with pathogens. Change is inherently brought about via phenomena at the genetic level – mutations, chromosomal rearrangements and epigenetic changes. While the general types of mutations hold true across the living world, in plants, some other mechanisms have been implicated as highly significant.|$|E

25|$|When {{the fourth}} Labour {{government}} came into power it uncovered a fiscal crisis {{that had been}} largely hidden by the outgoing Third National Government.

25|$|Vitamin B12 {{deficiency}} is {{the medical}} condition of low {{blood levels of}} vitamin B12. A wide variety of signs and symptoms may occur including a decreased ability to think and behavioural and emotional changes such as depression, irritability, and psychosis. Abnormal sensations, changes in reflexes, and poor muscle function can also occur as may inflammation of the tongue, decreased taste, low red blood cells, reduced heart function, and decreased fertility. In young children symptoms include poor growth, poor development, and difficulties with movement. Without early treatment <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> may be permanent.|$|E
25|$|The day-one patch, which Hello Games {{had been}} at work at since the game went gold in July, altered several aspects of how the procedurally {{generated}} universe was created, such that existing saves from previous copies would no longer work. This patch also removed an exploit that was observed by pre-release players {{that allowed them to}} complete the game much faster than anticipated. Commentators noted that the patch would substantially change the aspects of the game previously critiqued by aforementioned early players, and believed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> were made specifically to address these concerns.|$|E
25|$|The enlightened despot William I, who reigned from 1815–1840, {{had almost}} {{unlimited}} constitutional power, the constitution having {{been written by}} a number of notable people chosen by him. As despot, he had no difficulty in accepting <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> resulting from the social transformation of the previous 25 years, including equality of all before the law. However, he resurrected the estates as a political class and elevated {{a large number of people}} to the nobility. Voting rights were still limited, and only the nobility were eligible for seats in the upper house.|$|E

25|$|Season 5 {{featured}} {{more significant}} changes from the novels. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> were more well-received than others (the sexual assault scene was heavily criticized and caused great controversy). The various plotlines {{for the season}} also differed significantly in reception. The Dornish subplot received an overwhelmingly negative reception. In particular, the hyped Sand Snakes were maligned by critics and fans alike, as many found them cheesy and unlikeable. In contrast, Tyrion's storyline was highly praised. Many fans felt that his subplot progressed overly slowly in the novels, and his meeting with Daenerys was particularly lauded.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-2000s, NUS faced a {{financial}} crisis, {{caused by a}} coinciding of spiraling expenditure and decreasing income. A series of measures were proposed to address this, of which the most controversial included a series of changes to the constitutional and democratic processes. In 2004, two emergency conferences passed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> proposed, albeit not without fierce dispute between those claiming the proposals were necessary reforms to maintain {{the existence of the}} organisation and those arguing that they were aimed at curbing democracy and involvement. The 2006 NUS Conference passed a policy which enabled NUS to launch NUS Extra in September 2006.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> {{were related}} to toning down more mature content as well; the two scaled back on {{references}} to Aika being assaulted by Vigaro when captured by him, and of references to Ramirez obsessively talking about Galcian in later scenes of the game. Additionally, all traces of cigarettes are removed, shops serve Loqua juice instead of alcohol, and the female character Bellena's attire is altered to be less revealing. The entire project was a massive undertaking, taking four months of work with 80 to 100 hour work weeks, on a script of over 2,000 pages. The game was released in English in North America on November 13, 2000, and in Europe on April 21, 2001.|$|E
