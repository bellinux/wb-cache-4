40|$|In 1822, New York {{became the}} first common-law state to authorize the {{formation}} of <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships,</b> and over the ensuing decades, many other states followed.

40|$|Abstract: The {{financial}} accounting data about foreign direct investments (FDI), collected, classified, tabulated, {{and published by}} the leading statistical institutions of the world, are in part distorted (to the extent that General Partners and <b>Limited</b> <b>Partnerships</b> are involved), and in total contaminated (as distorted data {{are added to the}} total pool of data). The erroneous interpretation of the role of voting control, exercised by General Partners <b>in</b> <b>Limited</b> <b>Partnerships,</b> was accepted without critical analysis by the accounting profession, by the economists, and by the world statistical agencies, and is a cause of repeated systemic errors in financial data about FDI, in resulting economic data, in economic research, and in conclusions based on such data. The manuscript suggests ways to correct such widespread systemic methodological errors of interpretation and classification of FDI data and offers ways to improve financial reporting and economic statistics about FDI. ...|$|R

For larger risk exposure, a company (corporation) may be formed {{to serve as the}} general partner. A corporate general partner is protected from direct attack by a judgment creditor because the ultimate liability for the debts and obligations rests with the shareholders. By spreading share ownership, individual exposure is considerably reduced. Even without a corporate general partner, risk can be spread by distribution of <b>limited</b> <b>partnership</b> shares. If a judgment creditor obtains a charging order against one partner, the order goes to that partners <b>share</b> <b>in</b> distributions from the partnership, and not to the entire business.|$|R
