5|$|After {{reporting}} {{appearances of}} a tall woman in black who vanishes, and her teacher recommending {{that she was not}} herself, her mother took her to a physician. As a result, only two weeks before her death she was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia and hospitalized at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Lafayette, Louisiana. At the request of her family, she was informed by the hospital chaplain, Joseph Brennan, a newly ordained Catholic priest, that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> Though the illness was painful, she remained cheerful, meekly accepted her fate, and offered up her suffering to God. Brennan was deeply impressed by her faith and visited her daily. While dying, Richard prayed for other individuals to be healed or to be converted to Catholicism. The Director of Pediatrics at the hospital, Theresita Crowley, a nun, also witnessed her calm acceptance of suffering and prayers for others. Brennan and Crowley claimed that those for whom Richard prayed recovered from their illnesses or became Catholic. Richard died on 11 August 1959.|$|E
500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
2500|$|When {{her mother}} later began {{suffering}} {{as a result}} of the radiation therapy, Ruiz drove daily from her Phoenix workplace to the hospital in Lordsburg. [...] She developed the same symptoms as her mother, whose death made Ruiz feel that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> also. [...] While she didn't die, she did realized how dependent she had been on her mother. [...] She became determined to succeed in her career and started attending assertiveness-training courses offered at the hospital. [...] The courses helped her to increase her self-esteem, set goals, separate herself from her mother, and feel like she was in control of her life. [...] According to Ruiz, this sense of control was illusory: [...] "I didn't realize that it was God who was in control, I actually thought I was the one in control, can you believe it?!" ...|$|E

60|$|The woman rose, and sank, faint, on to {{the seat}} against the wall.

60|$|Every {{one noticed}} {{the change in}} Miss Helstone's appearance, and most people said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> She never thought so herself. She felt in no dying case; she had neither pain nor sickness. Her {{appetite}} was diminished; she knew the reason. It was because she wept so much at night. Her strength was lessened; she could account for it. Sleep was coy and hard to be won; dreams were distressing and baleful. In the far future she still seemed to anticipate a time when this passage of misery should be got over, and when she should once more be calm, though perhaps never again happy.|$|E
60|$|I {{immediately}} {{went to the}} great Cabin-door, taking the Lieutenant that call'd me, along with me, and caus'd the Cabin-door to be open'd: But such a Sight of Glory and Misery was never seen by Buccaneer before; the Queen (for such she was to have been) was all in Gold and Silver, but frighted; and crying, and at the Sight of me she appear'd trembling, and just as if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> She sate on the Side {{of a kind of}} a Bed like a Couch with no Canopy over it, or any Covering, only made to lie down upon; she was, in a Manner, cover'd with Diamonds, and I, like a true Pirate, soon let her see that I had more Mind to the Jewels than to the Lady.|$|E
60|$|When I {{heard this}} I went home much cast down, {{and from that}} time forward my mind was never easy. If only my wife's little finger ached I fancied <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> and sure enough before very long she fell really ill {{and in a few}} days breathed her last. My dismay was great, for {{it seemed to me that}} to be buried alive was even a worse fate than to be devoured by cannibals, {{nevertheless}} there was no escape. The body of my wife, arrayed in her richest robes and decked with all her jewels, was laid upon the bier. I followed it, and after me came a great procession, headed by the king and all his nobles, and in this order we reached the fatal mountain, which was one of a lofty chain bordering the sea.|$|E

60|$|It rained heavily {{all the way}} to Bright River, {{to which}} station they had to go, since the branch line train from Carmody did not connect with the boat train. Charlie and Gilbert were on the station {{platform}} when they reached it, and the train was whistling. Anne had just time to get her ticket and trunk check, say a hurried farewell to Diana, and hasten on board. She wished she were going back with Diana to Avonlea; she knew <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> of homesickness. And oh, if only that dismal rain would stop pouring down as if the whole world were weeping over summer vanished and joys departed! Even Gilbert's presence brought her no comfort, for Charlie Sloane was there, too, and Sloanishness could be tolerated only in fine weather. It was absolutely insufferable in rain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Her sister Luella {{was just}} the opposite," [...] said Miss Cornelia. [...] "There was no bright side for Luella--there was just black and shades of gray. For years she used always to be declaring <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> {{in a week or}} so. 'I won't be here to burden you long,' she would tell her family with a groan. And if any of them ventured to talk about their little future plans she'd groan also and say, 'Ah, I won't be here then.' When I went to see her I always agreed with her and it made her so mad that she was always quite a lot better for several days afterwards. She has better health now but no more cheerfulness. Myra was so different. She was always doing or saying {{something}} to make some one feel good. Perhaps the men they married {{had something to do with}} it. Luella's man was a Tartar, believe ME, while Jim Murray was decent, as men go. He looked heart-broken to-day. It isn't often I feel sorry for a man at his wife's funeral, but I did feel for Jim Murray." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the mean}} time the peace between Bartley and Marcia {{continued}} unbroken, {{and these days}} of waiting, of suffering, of hoping and dreading, were the happiest of their lives. He {{did his best to}} be patient with her caprices and fretfulness, and he was at least manfully comforting and helpful, and instant in atonement for every failure. She said a thousand times that she should die without him; and when her time came, he thought that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> before he could tell her of his sorrow for all that he had ever done to grieve her. He did not tell her, though she lived to give him the chance; but he took her and her baby both into his arms, with tears of as much fondness as ever a man shed. He even began his confession; but she said, [...] "Hush! you never did a wrong thing yet that I didn't drive you to." [...] Pale and faint, she smiled joyfully upon him, and put her hand on his head when he hid his face against hers on the pillow, and put her lips against his cheek. His heart was full; he was grateful for the mercy that had spared him; he was so strong in his silent repentance that he felt like a good man.|$|E

Directly I heard what was wanted I saw what a desperate affair it must be, and I {{made up my}} mind to see it out. Every minute was of importance. I had to wait for you first. Then, when we arrived at the Italia Una, old Giorgio shouted to me to go for the English doctor. Later on, that poor dying woman wanted to see me, as you know. Senor, I was {{reluctant}} to go. I felt already this cursed silver growing heavy upon my back, and I was afraid that, knowing herself to be dying, she would ask me to ride off again for a priest. Father Corbelan, who is fearless, would have come at a word; but Father Corbelan is far away, safe with the band of Hernandez, and the populace, that would have liked to tear him to pieces, are much incensed against the priests. Not a single fat padre would have consented to put his head out of his hiding-place to-night to save a Christian soul, except, perhaps, under my protection. That was in her mind. I pretended I did not believe <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> Senor, I refused to fetch a priest for a dying woman. [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|Whilst Mrs. Bolton was so discoursing, I {{wonder how}} many {{thousands}} of thoughts passed through Fanny's mind, and what dear times, sad struggles, lonely griefs, and subsequent shamefaced consolations were recalled to her? What pangs had the poor little thing, as she thought how much she had loved him, and that she loved him no more? There he stood, about whom <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> ten months since, dandified, supercilious, with a black crape to his white hat, and jet buttons in his shirt-front and a pink in his coat, that some one else had probably given him: with the tightest lavender-coloured gloves sewn with black and the smallest of canes. And Mr. Huxter wore no gloves, and great Blucher boots, and smelt very much of tobacco certainly; and looked, oh, it must be owned, {{he looked as if}} a bucket of water would do him a great deal of good! All these thoughts, and a myriad of others, rushed through Fanny's mind as her mamma was delivering herself of her speech, and as the girl, from under her eyes, surveyed Pendennis--surveyed him entirely from head to foot, the circle on his white forehead that his hat left when he lifted it (his beautiful, beautiful hair had grown again), the trinkets at his watch-chain, the ring on his hand under his glove, the neat shining boot, so, so unlike Sam's high-low!--and after her hand had given a little twittering pressure to the lavender-coloured kid grasp which was held out to it, and after her mother had delivered herself of her speech, all Fanny could find to say was, [...] "This is Mr. Samuel Huxter whom you knew formerly, I believe, sir; Mr. Samuel, you know you knew Mr. Pendennis formerly--and--and, will you take a little refreshment?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Aunt Polly's {{happiness}} was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly so. It {{would be}} complete, however, {{as soon as}} the messenger dispatched with the great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it, pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad Mississippi rolling by! And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men didn't believe the wild tale at first, [...] "because," [...] said they, [...] "you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in" [...] --then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.|$|E
