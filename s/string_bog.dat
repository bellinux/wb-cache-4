50|$|The Kepler Mire is internationally biologically {{significant}} {{because it is}} the most extensive pool system of the <b>string</b> <b>bog</b> form found in New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|Hummocks in {{the shape}} of low ridges of drier peat moss {{typically}} form part of the structure of certain types of raised bog, such as plateau, kermi, palsa or <b>string</b> <b>bog.</b> The hummocks alternate with shallow wet depressions or flarks.|$|E
50|$|<b>String</b> <b>bogs</b> or aapa fens (Aapamoore or Strangmoore) are {{typically}} {{found on the}} northern fringes of the distribution area for raised bogs, in the sub-polar zone, north of the 66th latitude in the northern hemisphere. Here, raised bogs only occur as islands within wetlands supplied by mineral soil water. On level ground these islands are irregularly distributed; on hillsides they form ridges parallel to the contours and {{at right angles to}} line of slope. The ridges separate boggy hollows of mineral soil known by the Finnish word, rimpis. The main distribution area for <b>string</b> <b>bogs</b> are the Scandinavian hills, central Finland, Karelia and north Sibiria. In North America, Alaska is the main location for <b>string</b> <b>bogs,</b> thanks to its cold continental climate. Frost action {{plays an important role in}} these bogs. On the ridges or hummocks, ground ice is found until early summer.|$|R
50|$|The interfluvial {{area between}} two of the Vakh tributaries, the Kolikyegan and Sabun, is a zone of raised <b>string</b> <b>bogs</b> {{covering}} 12885 km2.It is a status B Ramsar wetland, nominated for designation as a Wetland of International Importance in 2000.|$|R
50|$|Palsa bogs (Palsamoore or Palsenmoore) {{are found}} {{on the margins of}} the Arctic {{permafrost}} soils (tundra). Here the ridges of the <b>string</b> <b>bogs</b> can grow into hummocks several metres high. Like <b>string</b> <b>bogs,</b> the so-called palsas frequently lie within peatlands fed by mineral soil water. Some are surrounded by water-filled, ditch-like hollows. Peat formation is limited; these bogs are peat deposits from warmer, interglacial periods and did not experience frost heaving of their inner core of ice until the climate became colder. These ice lenses increase in size from year to year as a result of freeze-thaw processes of the surrounding water. The low temperatures prevent full decomposition of the organic material.|$|R
50|$|The Mealy Mountains {{encompass}} five of Labrador’s ten provincial ecoregions, including coastal s, high sub arctic tundra, high boreal forest, mid boreal forest, and <b>string</b> <b>bog.</b> The {{mountain range}} reach heights {{of more than}} 1000 m, with the highest peak being more than 1180 m.|$|E
50|$|Peter Jackson's flying Nazgûl {{background}} {{shots were}} filmed above the Kepler Mire, a massive <b>string</b> <b>bog</b> between {{the towns of}} Manapouri and Te Anau in the Southland Region of New Zealand. It can be viewed on the Mt York Road some 2 km east of the Highway 95 turn off.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>string</b> <b>bog</b> or strong mire is a bog {{consisting}} of slightly elevated ridges and islands, with woody plants, alternating with flat, wet sedge mat areas. String bogs occur on slightly sloping surfaces, with the ridges {{at right angles}} to the direction of water flow. They are an example of patterned vegetation.|$|E
50|$|<b>String</b> <b>bogs</b> are {{features}} {{associated with}} periglacial climates, where the temperature results in {{long periods of}} subzero temperatures. The active layer exists as frozen ground for long periods and melts in the spring thaw. Such slow melting results in characteristic mass movement processes and features exclusively associated with specific periglacial environments.|$|R
50|$|The interfluvial {{area between}} the Kolik-Egan and Sabun of the west Siberian lowland is a zone of raised <b>string</b> <b>bogs</b> {{covering}} 12885 km2.It is a status B Ramsar wetland, nominated for designation as a Wetland of International Importance in 2000.Martens are found throughout the Sabun River valley, as well as sables and kidas, crosses between sables and martens.|$|R
50|$|The interfluvial {{area between}} the Kolik-Egan and Sabun rivers of the west Siberian lowland is a zone of raised <b>string</b> <b>bogs</b> {{covering}} 12885 km2.It is a status B Ramsar wetland, nominated for designation as a Wetland of International Importance in 2000.The river gives {{its name to the}} Verkhae-Kolik'yegan oilfield, which has estimated ultimate recovery of 1,008 MMBO oil and of 4.2 tcf gas.|$|R
50|$|The nearby Juniper Barrens <b>String</b> <b>Bog,</b> {{the largest}} bog in the area, covers 12 square kilometres, and {{is home to}} the White Fringed Orchid (Platanthera blepharglottis), an {{uncommon}} type of Butterfly Orchid, and the sedge (grass) Carex eburnea. The peat is two to three metres deep. The bog is one of several unique sites in Maine and the Maritime Provinces of Canada, featured on the Irving Forest Discovery Network.|$|E
50|$|A <b>string</b> <b>bog</b> has {{a pattern}} of narrow (2-3m wide), low (<1m high) ridges {{oriented}} {{at right angles to}} the direction of drainage with wet depressions or pools occurring between the ridges. The water and peat are very low in nutrients because the water has been derived from other ombrotrophic wetlands, which receive all of their water and nutrients from precipitation, rather than from streams or springs. The peat thickness is >1m.|$|E
5000|$|The area {{includes}} the Upper Red Lake Peatland, a National Natural Landmark under the Historic Sites Act. [...] It received this designation in May 1975 from the United States Secretary of the Interior, giving it recognition as an outstanding {{example of the}} nation's natural history. [...] The designation describes it asOne of the largest peatlands remaining in the conterminous United States, illustrating a variety of geological features and plant associations, especially the dominant and rare <b>string</b> <b>bog.</b> An outstanding habitat for wildlife including endangered species.|$|E
50|$|Located {{in northeastern}} Canada, this {{ecoregion}} covers {{a large part}} of northern Quebec and most of Labrador, reaching from Hudson Bay and James Bay in the west, across to Ungava Bay and east to the Atlantic Ocean coast of Labrador. This is a taiga ecoregion and therefore stops at the treeline, beyond which is tundra. This is a rugged rocky landscape including an area fjords on the Atlantic coast of Labrador. The hills and plateaus are dotted with many lakes and <b>string</b> <b>bogs,</b> and patches of tundra on the Mealy Mountains and elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|Lake Agassiz Peatlands Natural Area is a 25411 acre National Natural Landmark {{located in}} Koochiching County, Minnesota. Designated in November 1965 under the Historic Sites Act, its {{ownership}} and oversight {{are provided by}} the National Park Service of the United States. [...] This designation from the United States Secretary of the Interior, gives it recognition as an outstanding example of the nation's natural history. [...] The designation describes it asAn example of the extensive peatlands occupying the bed of ancient glacial Lake Agassiz, illustrating the process of peat accumulation over about 11,000 years. The area contains Myrtle Lake Bog, which developed contrary to the usual successional process of lake filling, and {{is an excellent example}} of both raised and <b>string</b> <b>bogs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In cool climates with {{consistently}} high rainfall (on {{more than}} c. 235 days a year), the ground surface may remain waterlogged {{for much of}} the time, providing conditions for the development of bog vegetation. In these circumstances bog develops as a layer [...] "blanketing" [...] much of the land, including hilltops and slopes. Although a blanket bog is more common on acidic substrates, under some conditions it may also develop on neutral or even alkaline ones, if abundant acidic rainwater predominates over the ground water. A blanket bog cannot occur in drier or warmer climates, because under those conditions hilltops and sloping ground dry out too often for peat to form - in intermediate climates a blanket bog may be limited to areas which are shaded from direct sunshine. In periglacial climates a patterned form of blanket bog may occur, known as a <b>string</b> <b>bog.</b> In Europe, these mostly very thin peat layers without significant surface structures are distributed over the hills and valleys of Ireland, Scotland, England and Norway. In North America, blanket bogs occur predominantly in Canada east of Hudson Bay. These bogs are often still under the influence of mineral soil water (groundwater). Blanket bogs do not occur north of the 65th latitude in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, Noront Resources {{began using}} two frozen lakes—Koper Lake, located about 128 km north of Marten Falls, and McFaulds Lake—as landing strips without {{consulting}} Martens Falls and Webequie First Nations. The Mining Act only allows exploration activities, not {{the construction of}} permanent structures. Marten Falls First Nations Chief Eli Moonias explained in 2010 that Noront Resources did not have [...] "permits to construct landing strips on the <b>string</b> <b>bog</b> or roads to the nearby airstrip." [...] "The two First Nations proposed that they should build and maintain the infrastructure to prevent further damage to the wetlands environment." [...] Marten Falls First Nations Chief Eli Moonias described how over a seven-year period, Noront Resources [...] "sunk machines here and they have done outrageous acts here." [...] In the fall of 2009, the companies [...] "used a helicopter to break ice here with a log." [...] On February 3, 2010, Noront Resources Ltd. was {{trying to build a}} (landing) strip here on the string bog." [...] In January 2010, Chief Eli Moonias, Webequie Chief Cornelius Wabasse, and community members set up a blockade on the landing strips at Koper and McFaulds Lakes. Martens Falls and Webequie First Nations ended their blockade on March 19, 2010, with the admonition that they would resume the action if their concerns were not addressed by Noront within six months. Although the protest ended, Noront continued to use the frozen lakes as landing strips until break-up in 2010. Chief Eli Moonias expressed environmental concerns over [...] "sewage, grey-water, oil spills and road clearing" [...] over the seven-year period.|$|E
5000|$|Patterned {{vegetation}} is a vegetation {{community that}} exhibits distinctive and repetitive patterns. Examples of patterned vegetation include fir waves, tiger bush, and <b>string</b> <b>bog.</b> The patterns typically arise from an interplay of phenomena that differentially encourage plant growth or mortality. A coherent pattern arises {{because there is}} a strong directional component to these phenomena, such as wind in the case of fir waves, or surface runoff in the case of tiger bush.The regular patterning of some types of vegetation is a striking feature of some landscapes. Patterns can include relatively evenly spaced patches, parallel bands or some intermediate between those two. These patterns in the vegetation can appear without any underlying pattern in soil types, and are thus said to “self-organize” rather than be determined by the environment.Several of the mechanisms underlying patterning of vegetation have been known and studied since at least the middle of the 20th century, however, mathematical models replicating them have only been produced much more recently. The self-organization of complex spatial patterns can be generated from relatively simple mathematical expressions, often called a Turing pattern. These occur at many scales of life, from cellular development (where they were first proposed) to pattern formation on animal pelts to sand dunes and patterned landscapes (see also pattern formation). In their simplest form these models require two interactions at differing scales: local facilitation and more distant antagonism. For example, when Sato and Iwasa [...] produced a simple model of fir waves in the Japanese Alps, they assumed that trees exposed to cold winds would suffer mortality from frost damage, but upwind trees would protect nearby downwind trees from wind. Banding appears because the protective boundary layer created by the wind-most trees is eventually disrupted by turbulence, exposing more distant downwind trees to freezing damage once again.When there is no directional resource flow across the landscape, regularly spaced patches or spots appear. In contrast, if there is a clear directionality to some important factor (such as a freezing wind or surface flow down a slope), then regularly spaced bands develop perpendicular to the flow.Since then theoretical models have been published documenting a wide variety of patterned landscapes, including: [...] semi-arid “tiger bush”, [...] salt marshes, [...] fog dependent desert vegetation, [...] mires and fens.Although not strictly vegetation, sessile marine invertebrates such as mussels and oysters, have also been shown to form banding patterns.|$|E
40|$|A <b>string</b> <b>bog</b> {{ecosystem}} occupies part ofasubalpinevalleyon Mt Wellington, Tasmania. The {{steps in}} the subsurface biockstream preferentially underlie pools Variations in pool hydrology are independent of pool size. There is a correlarion between pool sbape and pool type, an oval sbape being indicative of more recent secondary pool formation, primary pools with rocky floors being variably shaped. Variation in the bog vegetation {{is closely related to}} variations in slope, drainage and peat depth. The major changes in abundance of pollen types are relared to changes in abundance of charcoal. The Mt Wellington <b>string</b> <b>bog</b> complex appears likely to have been formed by similar processes to those postulated to bave resulted in the <b>string</b> <b>bog</b> system at Mt Field...|$|E
