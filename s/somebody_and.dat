It became a prominent issue after a nationally televised game against Notre Dame. The mouthpiece became a symbol for two opposing viewpoints: for Mexican-Americans, it was a symbol of unity—Sanchez accepting his heritage; for critics, the gesture symbolized a radical political statement. Sanchez, who {{was born and raised in}} the United States, received hate mail urging him to return to Mexico.

[...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. It just seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?"

But I would love to see how she deals with the consequences of what she's done, because what’s interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was capable of this.'

500|$|The abuse {{he faced}} {{at the hands}} of opponents early in his NHL career {{prompted}} Iginla's coaches to work at developing his physical play. While he was not enthusiastic about fighting, Iginla accepted then head coach Brian Sutter's arguments that he needed to adopt a more aggressive style to improve as a player. Iginla is most effective when he has room to manoeuvre, and to create that space, he had to intimidate his opponents. The lessons Iginla learned have carried throughout his career. [...] "You've got a power forward who does it all," [...] said Craig Conroy. [...] "I mean, he'll fight, and hit, and score goals. Maybe it's not the end-to-end rushes, but he does all those little things that win games and get things done." [...] His opponents also respect his play.

He does pretty much everything you'd want a guy to do." ...|$|E

This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose <b>somebody,</b> <b>and</b> it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again.

500|$|In the postseason, Maryland {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} the Humanitarian Bowl to play the Western Athletic Conference runner-up, Nevada. Before the game, however, head coach Ralph Friedgen caught Scott and six other players breaking curfew. Scott declined to comment to the media about why he had missed curfew, and Friedgen said only that Scott had tried to [...] "help <b>somebody</b> <b>and</b> got put in a bad situation." [...] Friedgen initially intended to send the offenders back to College Park by bus, but athletic director Deborah Yow convinced him to issue partial-game suspensions instead. Scott was benched until halfway through the third quarter. He said, [...] "I made a bad decision. I felt I had to run with a purpose." [...] Scott was put into the game on Maryland's third possession of the half but did not receive a carry until the following series. On his first attempt, he ran for 14yards and then ran 11yards on his second. During the next drive, he broke free on a 49-yard touchdown run. On the next possession, Scott rushed on all four plays and gained 66yards and another touchdown. Maryland won, 42–35, and Scott was named the Terrapins' most valuable player of the game. Nevada head coach Chris Ault said, [...] "He just ran through us like we weren't there. They ran the weak-side gap, we knew that was one of their base plays, and he did a great job. He's a heck of a back, no question about it. He was breaking tackles, and that's not only a difference-maker but a morale-changer." [...] He ran for 174yards, which broke the school record for rushing in a bowl game previously set by Lu Gambino in the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also became just the seventh Maryland player to surpass the 1,000-yard single-season rushing benchmark. Earlier in the season, Scott set that mark as one of his goals, and he adorned his room with the statistics of the Terrapins who accomplished that feat in the past, such as Chris Downs in 2002.|$|E

I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now." [...] Former The Star-Ledger columnist Alan Sepinwall expressed a negative perspective on the episode, deeming it childish and ridiculous. He disliked Rhimes' conception of the story arc involving Stevens, elaborating, [...] "If there's a doctor on this show who should be forced to repeat their intern year, if only to prevent them from being allowed to influence younger doctors, it's Izzie, not George. She proves her unfitness for this role with her first patient of the day, the deer. Not cute, not character-illuminating, just dumb." [...] Also criticized was Torres, whose regression from a [...] "cool, rocking, outgoing, cofident and full of life" [...] role was highlighted, receiving negative feedback from Sepinwall, who wrote [...] "Now the character exists entirely so the writers can dump on her, in a devolution far worse than anything. I just don't get it, and it pains me to watch any scene with Callie in it. Despite expressing a negative outlook on Meredith's story arc which dealt with Shepherd, noting that the [...] "constant break-ups and reunions are as silly as if Shonda Rhimes had just kept them apart for three seasons before letting them kiss", Sepinwall was favorable of Lexie's arrival at Seattle Grace, feeling that [...] "she's still being written as Meredith circa season one in an attempt to make us like her, but I didn't mind the manipulation, if only because there are so few characters left on this show to like."
