5|$|After re-emerging {{into the}} Caribbean Sea, Ella deepened further and peaked as 115mph (185km/h) Category3 {{hurricane}} on September2, {{while it was}} making landfall near Santiago de Cuba, Cuba.

Hundreds of livestock drowned, and telephone and telegraph services were disrupted in many areas. The storm became disorganized while moving across the southern coast of Cuba and weakened to a tropical storm by later on September2. Ella reached the Gulf of Mexico on September 4 and briefly re-strengthened. However, it began to weaken again while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States. The storm made landfall as a weak tropical storm near Corpus Christi, Texas on September6. It rapidly weakened inland and dissipated later that day. Rainfall and rough surf caused both inland and coastal flooding in Texas. Offshore, the captain of a <b>snapper</b> boat fell overboard and went missing; he was later presumed to have drowned.|$|E
