50|$|<b>Sarmazenil</b> (Ro15-3505) {{is a drug}} {{from the}} {{benzodiazepine}} family. It acts as a partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptors, meaning that it causes the opposite effects to most benzodiazepine drugs, and instead acts as an anxiogenic and convulsant. It is used in veterinary medicine to reverse the effects of benzodiazepine sedative drugs in order to rapidly re-awaken anesthetized animals.|$|E
40|$|Sixteen captive female {{red deer}} were {{successfully}} anesthetized to surgically implant a telemetry system. The deer were immobilized with (mean±SD) 1. 79 ± 0. 29 mg/kg xylazine and 1. 79 ± 0. 29 mg/kg tiletamine/zolazepam given intramuscularly with a dart gun. Anesthesia was maintained for 69 ± 2 min using a total intravenous protocol with a catheter {{placed in the}} jugular vein. Group X received xylazine (0. 5 ± 0. 055 mg/kg/hr) and group D, detomidine (2 ± 0. 22 µg/kg/hr), both in combination with ketamine (2 ± 0. 02 mg/kg/hr) and midazolam (0. 03 ± 0. 0033 mg/kg/hr), as a constant rate infusion. Anesthesia was reversed with 0. 09 ± 0. 01 mg/kg atipamezole and 8. 7 ± 1. 21 µg/kg <b>sarmazenil</b> given intravenously in both groups. These drug combinations provided smooth induction, stable anesthesia for surgery, and rapid recovery. Respiratory depression and mild hypoxemia were seen, and we, therefore, recommend using supplemental intranasal oxygen...|$|E
40|$|In 8 captive adult {{chimpanzees}} {{of various}} ages premedicated with oral zuclopenthixol anaesthesia was induced intramuscularly {{with a combination}} of medetomidine and ketamine (40 or 50 µg/kg and 5 mg/kg, IM, respectively), with and without midazolam (0. 05 mg/kg), and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. At the end of the procedure, sedation was reversed with atipamezole (0. 25 mg/kg, IM) and <b>sarmazenil</b> (0. 005 mg/kg, IM) when midazolam had been administered. Oral zuclopenthixol resulted in tranquillization of the whole group and only one animal required a second dart injection to achieve adequately deep anaesthesia. Effective and reliable anaesthesia was achieved in all apes; the depth of hypnosis was stable and sudden arousal did not occur. Physiological parameters remained within normal ranges in the majority of the animals; however, manageable anaesthesia-related complications, namely apnoea after darting, hypotension, hypoventilation, hypoxemia and prolonged recovery, occurred in 6 out of 8 animals. The use of monitoring devices was essential to guarantee adequate management of these complications...|$|E
40|$|In {{veterinary}} practice intraveneous anaesthesia has numerous advantages. An important {{advantage is}} the ease and rapidity of induction. Compared to administration of inhalant anaesthetics, {{a minimum of}} apparatus is necessary in administration of intraveneous anaesthetic agents. The possibility of antagonization of certain drugs used as intraveneous anaesthetics increases the safety of anaesthesia. The unpleasant recovery period can also be shortened, which for a busy veterinarian and also the owner can be of great relief. Ideally, a postoperative patient should be conscious, co-operative, calm and free of pain. This will provide better homeostasis of vital functions, allow early {{diagnosis and treatment of}} complications and decrease the need for nursing care. The aim of these studies was to analyze the sedative/ analgetic / anaesthetic, cardiovascular and respiratory effects produced by a combination of medetomidine and climazolam at two different dose levels (1. 5 mg/kg and 3. 0 mg/kg). Climazolam was also combined with fentanyl. Antagonization followed anaesthesia, using atipamezole, nalorphine and a new benzodiazepine antagonist, <b>sarmazenil.</b> 7 laboratory beagles were used inthis experimental study. In combination with medetomidine, climazolam produced smooth anaesthesia and had only small effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory system. Total analgesia was not achived. Intubation was easily performed. The antagonization proved to be fast and complete. When combining climazolam with fentanyl, dose levels were chosen according to previous studies (Erhardt et al., 1986). The anaesthesia was light and short, probably due to the short action of fentanyl. This combination depressed the respiratory system in a much larger scale than the combination of medetomidine and climazolam did. Antagonization was effective. Kirurgia. Vain tiivistelmä.

40|$|Therapeutic {{modulation}} of {{the increased}} GABAergic tone in chronic hepatic encephalopathy (HE) by the benzodiazepine receptor (BR) antagonist flumazenil (F) has led to conflicting results in humans and animal models for HE. The BR inverse agonist <b>sarmazenil</b> (S) has only been used in animal models of acute HE. Therefore we investigated the effects of intravenous injection of F and S in dogs with chronic HE 8 to 12 weeks after placement of a portocaval shunt and 40 % hepatectomy (n= 7), compared to sham-operated pair-fed controls (n= 7). The HE dogs had hyperammonemia (298 +/- 48 microM v 33 +/- 3 before surgery (mean +/- SEM)) and signs of HE {{at the start of}} the experiments (0. 9 +/- 0. 1 (scale 0 - 4)). Three (S 3) and 8 (S 8) mg/kg of S resulted in a significant improvement of encephalopathy (grade 0. 9 +/- 0. 2 immediately before v 0. 5 +/- 0. 1 after injection (S 3) and 0. 7 +/- 0. 1 v 0. 3 +/- 0. 1 (S 8)) and increase in mean dominant frequency of the EEG (MDF; 9. 1 +/- 0. 7 Hz v 11. 1 +/- 0. 3 (S 3) and 8. 9 +/- 0. 5 v 11. 0 +/- 0. 3 (S 8)) in HE dogs, whereas 15 mg/kg of S, 3 and 8 mg/kg of F, and the vehicle had no significant effects. The efficacy of S in these dogs is consistent with an increased GABAergic tone in the pathogenesis of chronic HE. The lack of effects of F makes a role for endogenous benzodiazepines herein unlikel...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} medetomidine, midazolam and ketamine (MMK) in captive gorillas after premedication with oral zuclopenthixol. Study design Case series. Animals Six gorillas, two males and four females, aged 9 – 52 years and weighing 63 – 155 kg. Methods The gorillas were given zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride 0. 2 ± 0. 05 mg kg) 1 per os twice daily for 3 days for premedication. On the day of anaesthesia the dose of zuclopenthixol was increased to 0. 27 mg kg) 1 and given once early in the morning. Anaesthesia was induced with medetomidine 0. 04 ± 0. 004 mg kg) 1, midazolam 0. 048 ± 0. 003 mg kg) 1 and ketamine 4. 9 ± 0. 4 mg kg) 1 intramuscularly (IM). Upon recumbency, the trachea was intubated and anaesthesia was maintained on 1 – 2 % isoflurane in oxygen. Physiological parameters were monitored every 10 minutes and arterial blood gas analysis was performed once 30 – 50 minutes after initial darting. At {{the end of the}} procedure, 42 – 115 minutes after initial darting, immobilisation was antagonized with atipamezole 0. 21 ± 0. 03 mg kg) 1 and <b>sarmazenil</b> 5 ± 0. 4 lg kg) 1 IM. Results Recumbency was reached within 10 minutes in five out of six animals. One animal required two additional darts before intubation was feasible. Heart rate ranged from 60 to 85 beats minute) 1, respiratory rate from 17 to 46 breaths minute) 1 and temperature from 36. 9 to 38. 3 �C. No spontaneous recoveries were observed and anaesthetic level was stable. Blood gas analyses revealed mild respiratory acidosis, and mean PaO 2 was 24. 87 ± 17. 16 kPa (187 ± 129 mmHg) with all values being above 13. 4 kPa (101 mmHg). Recovery was smooth and gorillas were sitting within 25 minutes. Conclusion and clinical relevance The drug combination proved to be effective in anaesthetizing captive gorillas of various ages and both sexes, with minimal cardio-respiratory changes...|$|E
