5|$|Beginning in the 1950s Chelsea Bridge {{became a}} {{favourite}} meeting place for motorcyclists, who would race {{across the bridge}} on Friday nights. On 17 October 1970 a serious confrontation took place on Chelsea Bridge between the Essex and Chelsea chapters of the Hells Angels, and rival motorcycle gangs the Road Rats, Nightingales, Windsor Angels and Jokers. Around 50 people {{took part in the}} fight; weapons used included motorcycle chains, flick knives and at least one spiked flail. One member of the Jokers was <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sawn-off shotgun and fatally wounded, and 20 of those present were sentenced to between one and twelve years imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Carabane {{has many}} {{historic}} sites, {{such as the}} Catholic mission house built in 1880 which has since {{been turned into a}} hotel, a Brittany-style church building which is no longer in use, and a former slave-trade building. There is also a French cemetery where a Troupes de marine-Captain with the name Aristide Protet was <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> poisoned arrow and buried standing {{up in front of the}} sea, according to his last wishes. Some tour guides falsely claim that this was Auguste Léopold Protet, the founder of the city of Dakar, but the name Aristide Protet is clearly shown on the tomb's plaque.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large tarp draped over the actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects to drown out the noise. The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E

5|$|In 2014–15, Paul {{played in}} all 82 {{games for the}} first time in his career, {{averaging}} 19.1 points and a league-high 10.2 assists per game. In Game 7 of the first round of the playoffs, he hit a go-ahead <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> second left to lift the Clippers over the Spurs despite a hamstring injury. The injury forced him to miss the first two games of the next series versus the Houston Rockets, and Los Angeles eventually lost in seven games despite holding a 3–1 series lead. The defeat marked ten consecutive seasons and seven consecutive playoff appearances without a Conference Finals appearance for Paul.|$|E
5|$|La tragedia del silencio {{was shot}} in {{temporary}} studios {{in the house of}} a priest named Moreira, which is now the location of the Jorge-Eliécer-Gaitán theatre. Initially, the film was <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Pathé camera with a 45mm lens, but later a 35mm Kodak Ektachrome was used. The chemicals used for the production of the film were purchased from Óptica Alemana, a company located in Bogotá founded in 1914 by Ernesto Schmidt Mumm. The photographic print was manufactured by the scientific section of airline SCADTA.|$|E
5|$|Octopus, Thong's {{partner in}} crime, {{is played by}} Louis Koo, an award winning actor with past {{appearances}} including the TVB drama series Detective Investigation Files IV and the films Election and Election 2. Although Koo co-starred with Jackie Chan, a number of action scenes involving his character were <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stunt double. In addition, Koo was the baby's favourite on set—Whenever the baby cried, Koo was always the first to cheer him up.|$|E

5000|$|The {{length of}} shots is an {{important}} consideration that can greatly affect a film. The purpose of editing any given scene {{is to create a}} representation of the way the scene might be perceived by the [...] "story teller." [...] <b>Shots</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> longer duration can make a scene seem more relaxed and slower paced whereas <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shorter duration can make a scene seem urgent and faster paced.|$|R
5|$|The episode {{served as}} a {{continuation}} of the season premiere, in which local news anchor Diane Simmons was killed after being <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sniper rifle by Stewie, after she had killed several other secondary characters. News anchor Joyce Kinney was brought in as a replacement for Simmons on the local news, alongside Tom Tucker. The character is voiced by actress Christine Lakin, who has guest starred in various roles throughout the course of the series.|$|E
5|$|Using a {{technique}} pioneered on Back to the Future Part II, another <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> different lighting scheme was filmed. By combining separate key light and fill light passes, optical effects could generate {{any amount of}} contrast they wanted without causing spillage. Because Paramount continued to add new shots to the busy schedule and tight budget, some elements were flipped for reuse, including the star fields and {{a shot of the}} Bird of Prey firing. Whenever possible, the ships were filmed from below to reinforce the nautical theme, with their movements intended to remind the audience of galleons or other large seafaring vessels.|$|E
5|$|CG {{was also}} used to {{recreate}} the San Francisco neighborhood at Washington and Cherry Streets where cab driver Paul Stine was killed. The area had changed significantly {{over the years and}} residents didn't want the murder to be re-created in their neighborhood, so Fincher shot the six-minute sequence on a bluescreen stage. Production designer Donald Burt gave the visual effects team detailed drawings of the intersection as it was in 1969. Photographs of every possible angle of the area were <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high-resolution digital camera, allowing the effects crew to build computer-based geometric models of homes that were then textured with period facades. 3-D vintage police motorcycles, squad cars, a firetruck and street lights were added to the final shot.|$|E

5|$|In London, M assigns Bond to {{investigate}} the attack. He flies to Saint Petersburg to meet CIA operative Jack Wade, who suggests that Bond meet with Valentin Zukovsky, a former KGB agent and business rival of Janus. Zukovsky arranges a meeting between Bond and Janus. Onatopp surprises Bond at the Grand Hotel Europe and attempts to kill him, but he overpowers her. She takes Bond to Janus, who reveals himself as Trevelyan; he faked his death at Arkhangelsk but was badly scarred by the explosion. A descendant of the Cossack clans who collaborated with the Nazi forces in the Second World War, Trevelyan had vowed revenge against the British after they betrayed the Cossacks, which drove his father to kill Trevelyan's mother and himself. Just as Bond is about to shoot Trevelyan, Bond is <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tranquilizer dart.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round, the {{defending}} champion, Team San Antonio was eliminated along with Team Los Angeles. Both teams took over 15shots from the half court location to score. Team Detroit and Team Phoenix both {{advanced to the}} final round. Team Phoenix recorded the fastest completion time {{in the first round}} with 53.3seconds, six seconds faster than Team Detroit. In the final round, Team Detroit made the first five shots in 13attempts and used only 7attempts to make the half court <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> time of 58.4seconds. Team Phoenix responded by making their first five shots in a single attempt each. However, they needed 22attempts to make the half-court shot, finishing with a time of 1minute and 19seconds. Team Detroit won their second Shooting Stars title, joining Team San Antonio as the only two-time winners of the competition. Detroit Pistons legend and Detroit Shock head coach, Bill Laimbeer also became the first person to win the Shooting Stars Competition twice; he won his first title with Team Detroit in 2007.|$|E
5|$|One {{challenge}} for the production team was how to convey Bella's depression once Edward departs. In the novel, these pages were filled {{with the names of}} the passing months, and in the movie, would be represented as a visual effects <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> camera circling around Kristen Stewart. The window that was used for the original film did not quite fit what Weitz was looking for, so the production team created a bay window when recreating the Swan house. The effect was one of the 300 visual effects helmed by Prime Focus led by visual effects supervisor Eric Pascarelli. It required matching two camera shots: one that shot the actress in a chair, and the other shooting the view outside the window as seen from the house built on location. Using a greenscreen, Prime Focus was able to enhance the changing of seasons with computer-generated leaves and falling snow.|$|E

5|$|Searching for a V8 {{engine for}} the Magnum Opus, Max learns about a race in Gastown with a Big Chief V8 as a prize. After winning the race against Stank Gum (Yuri Lowenthal) and {{defeating}} the fighter Tenderloin in a Thunderdome duel, Max receives {{the engine and}} the concubine Hope (Courtenay Taylor). His victory is short-lived; Scrotus delivers the prize and attacks him. After he is <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crossbow and thrown down a mine shaft Max is saved by Hope, who takes him to the Organic Mechanic and Scab (Orion Acaba)—also known as the Bloodbag. While Max is undergoing surgery, he has a hallucination that his wedding to Hope is officiated by Chumbucket and {{a man with a}} dog's head. When he wakes up, he and Hope steal the Big Chief; they drive to the temple of Deep Friah (Robin Atkin Downes), a friendly fire cultist.|$|E
5|$|The co-main event {{featured}} a bout between two top contenders and undefeated light heavyweights, Lyoto Machida and Thiago Silva. The two were originally {{scheduled to meet}} at UFC 89, but a back injury forced Silva {{to withdraw from the}} contest. UFC President Dana White indicated in the pre-fight press conference that Machida would receive a title <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> victory, while Silva would need to defeat Machida and win one more contest before earning the same opportunity. Machida is a fighter who prefers to counter-strike, and combines Shotokan Karate, sumo wrestling and Brazilian jiu-jitsu to form his own style. Silva is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt, but prefers to fight standing. Machida entered the UFC 94 fight following a unanimous decision victory over former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz at UFC 84, where he won every round on the judge's scorecards. Thiago Silva entered the contest with 1st round TKOs over Antonio Mendes at UFC 84, and Houston Alexander at UFC 78.|$|E
5|$|The eighth {{match was}} a Triple Threat {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship between then World Heavyweight Champion The Great Khali, Batista, and Kane. In the beginning, Khali {{dominated}} most of the match, applying a nerve hold on Kane and attacking Batista. Outside the ring, they both tried to perform their separate finishers on Khali, who countered both attempts. Batista and Kane performed a double-team spinebuster and chokeslam through a broadcast table. Kane performed a Chokeslam on Batista for a near-fall. Kane then retrieved a steel chair, but Batista countered a chair <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Spinebuster, and then performed a Batista Bomb on Kane. As Batista went for the pinfall, Khali pulled Batista outside the ring and threw Batista into the steel steps. Khali executed a Khali Bomb on Kane to win the match and retain the Title.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} posse {{is captured}} by Chiricahua Apache Native Americans, who {{blame them for}} the alien attacks. After Ella's corpse is dumped on a fire by a Chiricahua warrior, she is resurrected and emerges from the fire. Ella reveals herself to be from another alien race, who had travelled to Earth to help resist the invaders after they destroyed her home world. The aliens, who are mining gold and abducting people to conduct experiments to find humans' weaknesses, are far stronger and more durable than humans, and have superior weaponry, but are not invulnerable. They can be stabbed and shot to death, but only Jake's gauntlet weapon or a well-aimed <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rifle can kill them with a single blast. Ella tells them that the aliens which previously attacked them are just scouts.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} the Bird-of-Prey on Vulcan were {{combinations}} of live-action footage—actors on a set in the Paramount parking lot that was covered with clay and used backdrops—and matte paintings for the ship itself and harsh background terrain. The scene of the ship's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish; the camera pans behind live-action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere, and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring sun had to {{be integrated into the}} shot. Rather than try to match and combine camera pans of each element, each component was <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> static camera and the pan was added to the resulting composite by a motion control camera. The sun (a light bulb focused by a convex lens) was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird-of-Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot.|$|E
25|$|Hrithik's {{enacting}} of {{a ballet}} sequence with a transparent ball was originally <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> real ball. However some shots {{needed to have}} a CG ball when it was impractical to execute the <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> real one. In between the sequence, Hrithik lies on the ball to take a 360-degree turn. This was originally <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> green cubical turntable to give Hrithik the necessary support to do the act and the table had to be replaced with the transparent ball.|$|E
