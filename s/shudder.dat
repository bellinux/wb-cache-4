Gastroesophageal reflux may cause arching of the back and twisting of the {{head to the side}} in infants, which may be mistaken for tonic-clonic seizures.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers was {{developed}} by Sorath, a Melbourne-based independent video game developer. The development group was formed by Matt Bush, a member of Dustforce creators Hitbox Team. The game's art direction and rendering engine were designed to reimagine the aesthetics and graphical style of video games from the 1990s. This was achieved by making use of unfiltered textures, jagged 3D models, and the deliberate implementation of polygon jitter and texture warping found in early 3D games. Jitter and warping were often considered technical flaws of PlayStation games; however, the recreation of these effects in Devil Daggers is to make enemies <b>shudder</b> and ripple during movement. Enemy designs are hellish, with some entities taking the form of insectoids with skeletal features. Audio is composed largely of distorted and abstract sounds with compressed, digitised screams used to produce unsettling noises for the creatures.|$|E

60|$|He <b>shuddered</b> lightly now and again, as {{they stepped}} lurching down the hill. He set his jaws hard to {{suppress}} this <b>shuddering.</b> It {{was not in}} his limbs, or even {{on the surface of}} his body, for Helena did not notice it. Yet he <b>shuddered</b> almost in anguish internally.|$|R
25|$|Morris {{had become}} very fed up of hearing Bedser's name. He sat that morning at No. 13 {{table in the}} hotel dining-room and gave a <b>shudder</b> {{when he saw it}} – but decided to sit tight. This, then, was a happy day for him. he had come back to the ranks of Test batsmen again.|$|E
25|$|The {{crew of the}} {{submarine}} Karelia detected the explosion but the captain assumed that {{it was part of}} the exercise. Aboard Petr Velikiy, the target of the practice launch, the crew detected a hydro-acoustic signal characteristic of an underwater explosion and felt their hull <b>shudder.</b> They reported the phenomena to fleet headquarters but their report was ignored.|$|E
25|$|As MacKenzie's layout {{was seen}} by more and more people, a {{collective}} <b>shudder</b> ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed—"looking like rabbits in the headlights"—as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it—they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the enormity of it. It was a 'classic smear'.|$|E
60|$|Déroulède <b>shuddered</b> {{when first}} he beheld the scene, <b>shuddered</b> {{at the very}} thought of finding Juliette amongst these careless, laughing, thoughtless mimes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Martha! Martha!" [...] now murmured Lucy, in a scarce audible whispering, and <b>shuddering</b> in the maid's own <b>shuddering</b> arms, [...] "quick, quick; come to me--drive it away! wake me! wake me!" ...|$|R

25|$|One day in February, Satoko's parents {{travel to}} Kyoto {{to see a}} sick relative; taking {{advantage}} of this, she persuades Kiyoaki to skip school and join her on a rickshaw ride through the snow. They kiss for the first time. When they pass the parade ground of the Azabu 3rd Regiment he has a vision of thousands of ghostly soldiers standing upon it, reproducing {{the scene in the}} photograph described in Chapter 1. Miles away, Honda has a similar premonitory <b>shudder,</b> seeing his friend's empty desk in the schoolroom. The next morning, they meet very early in the school grounds and have a long conversation in which Honda expresses his conviction of the reality of fate and inevitability.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just <b>shudder</b> at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E
500|$|Above the waterline, {{there was}} little {{evidence}} of the collision. The stewards in the first class dining room noticed a <b>shudder,</b> which they thought might {{have been caused by}} the ship shedding a propeller blade. Many of the passengers felt a bump or <b>shudder</b> – [...] "just as though we went over about a thousand marbles", as one survivor put it – but did not know what had happened. Those on the lowest decks, nearest the site of the collision, felt it much more directly. Engine Oiler Walter Hurst recalled being [...] "awakened by a grinding crash along the starboard side. No one was very much alarmed but knew we had struck something". Fireman George Kemish heard a [...] "heavy thud and grinding tearing sound" [...] from the starboard hull.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not if {{you don't}} want to.' Then again there was silence. Hermione <b>shuddered</b> {{with a strange}} desire. Ah, if only he had asked HER to subserve him, to be his slave! She <b>shuddered</b> with desire.|$|R
6000|$|Philammon stood stupefied and <b>shuddering.</b> All his own early doubts flashed across {{him like}} a thunderbolt, when in the temple-cave he had seen those painted ladies at their revels, and <b>shuddered,</b> and asked himself, were they burning for ever and ever? ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} he was <b>shuddering</b> rapidly. A {{peculiar}} feeling, as if his belly were turned into nothingness, made him want to press his fists into his abdomen. He remained <b>shuddering</b> drunkenly, like a drunken man who is sick, incapable of thought or action.|$|R
500|$|Times {{reviewer}} Richard Corliss {{praised the}} action scenes and Noyce's persistence in keeping a serious tone – [...] "he ignores the story's preposterous elements {{and lets the}} audience decide whether to laugh, <b>shudder</b> or both". [...] Empires William Thomas praised Jolie's performance remarking that [...] "when it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business", and Village Voices Karina Longworth considered that original star Tom Cruise would never express the protagonist's ambiguity as well as Jolie.|$|E
500|$|Foo Fighters was {{released}} July 4, 1995 on Roswell Records, distributed by Capitol Records. The band promoted the release that summer by completing another US tour with Wool and <b>Shudder</b> to Think, with 25 concerts in {{little over a}} month. The Foo Fighters also made their network television debut on the Late Show with David Letterman in August 14, where they performed [...] "This Is a Call". Afterwards, the band played several of their largest shows up to that point, making their debut on the European festival circuit with performances at Pukkelpop, Reading and Lowlands.|$|E
500|$|At 13:43:15, {{the rapidly}} {{ascending}} Greeneville surfaced directly under Ehime Maru (...) , and the submarine's rudder sliced Ehime Maru hull from starboard to port. [...] The people aboard Ehime Maru heard two loud noises {{and felt the}} ship <b>shudder</b> from two severe impacts. [...] Ehime Maru bridge crew looked aft and saw the submarine broach the water next to their ship. [...] Within five seconds Ehime Maru lost power and began to sink. [...] As Waddle watched through Greenevilles periscope, Ehime Maru stood almost vertically on its stern and sank in about five minutes as {{the people on the}} fishing ship scrambled to abandon ship.|$|E

500|$|The Court {{returned}} {{to the issue of}} abortion in the 2000 case of Stenberg v. Carhart, in which it invalidated a Nebraska statute outlawing partial-birth abortion. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the Court that the law was unconstitutional because it did not allow an exception for the health of the woman. Scalia dissented, comparing the Stenberg case to two of the most reviled cases in Supreme Court history: [...] "I am optimistic enough to believe that, one day, Stenberg v. Carhart will be assigned its rightful place {{in the history of this}} Court's jurisprudence beside Korematsu and Dred Scott. The method of killing a human child... proscribed by this statute is so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a <b>shudder</b> of revulsion".|$|E
500|$|Maus proved {{difficult}} to classify to a genre, {{and has been}} called biography, fiction, autobiography, history, and memoir. [...] Spiegelman petitioned The New York Times to move it from [...] "fiction" [...] to [...] "non-fiction" [...] on the newspaper's bestseller list, saying, [...] "I <b>shudder</b> to think how David Duke... would respond to seeing a carefully researched work based closely on my father's memories of life in Hitler's Europe and in the death camps classified as fiction". [...] An editor responded, [...] "Let's go out to Spiegelman's house and if a giant mouse answers the door, we'll move it to the nonfiction side of the list!" [...] The Times eventually acquiesced. [...] The Pulitzer committee sidestepped the issue by giving the completed Maus a Special Award in Letters in 1992.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars, writing [...] "There {{is hardly a}} thing I can say in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it. I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, but I can say that I was not bored and {{sometimes}} I was unreasonably pleased." [...] Likewise, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B−" [...] grade and said, [...] "The Mummy {{would like to make}} you <b>shudder,</b> but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality." [...] Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects.|$|E

500|$|... (Nine hundred {{was roughly}} {{the number of}} men in a single {{infantry}} battalion, and as regiments were formed on local lines, most would have been from the same county; it is thus emphasised that his crime is a black mark against both the regiment, as a whole, and against his comrades.) The fourth verse comes to the hanging; Files sees the body against the sun, and then feels his soul as it [...] "whimpers" [...] overhead; the term reflects a <b>shudder</b> in the ranks as they watch Deever die. Finally, the Sergeant moves the men away; though it is not directly mentioned in the poem, they would be marched past the corpse on the gallows – reflecting that the recruits are shaking after their ordeal, and that [...] "they'll want their beer to-day".|$|E
500|$|Feroz Khan's Janbaaz (1986) {{told the}} story of a man {{fighting}} the drug menace. The film became known for its steamy love scene involving Kapadia and male lead Anil Kapoor, in which the two also shared a full on kiss, something Hindi movie-goers were not accustomed to in those days. In that same year she acted opposite Saagar co-star Kamal Haasan in her first regional film, Vikram, a Tamil-language sci-fi feature. She played the minor part of Inimaasi, a young princess who falls for the title character, played by Haasan. At that time, she also worked in numerous Hindi films made by producers from the South, including Pataal Bhairavi, which she detested. She has confessed to accepting these roles for financial gain rather than artistic merit during this period, noting, [...] "I <b>shudder</b> even now when I think of those films. As an artiste I got totally corrupted." ...|$|E
500|$|In the song's first verse, [...] "Belle articulates how her {{attraction}} to [...] stems from his shut-off demeanor," [...] singing, [...] "There's something sweet/And almost kind/But he was mean/And he was coarse and unrefined/But now he's dear/And so unsure/I wonder why I didn't see it there before." [...] The Beast's verse reads, [...] "when we touched she didn't <b>shudder</b> at my paw." [...] According to Laurence E. MacDonald, {{author of the}} book The Invisible Art of Film Music: A Comprehensive History, Benson [...] "shocked many filmgoers with his richly resonant baritone." [...] Finally, Belle sings the song's bridge, which reads, [...] "New and a bit alarming/Who'd have ever thought that this could be?/True, that he's no Prince Charming/But there's something in him that I simply didn't see." [...] According to the Los Angeles Times, by the end of [...] "Something There", [...] "the audience understands what Belle and Beast feel and how disconcerting those emotions seem." ...|$|E
