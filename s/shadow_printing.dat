40|$|Photomasks contain {{geometric}} {{information that}} will be transferred to substrates or pre-structured surfaces. Conventional mask aligner lithography {{in the sense of}} <b>shadow</b> <b>printing</b> of the photomask suffers from limited achievable resolution. Photomask and substrate are typically separated by an air gap causing diffraction effects and hence affecting the minimum structure size. Even though contact lithography offers a resolution in the wavelengthscale, yield problems and contamination of the photomask are its drawbacks. Using proximity lithography, these problems can be avoided since it profits from a contact-free exposure process. To overcome the resolution limitation of the <b>shadow</b> <b>printing</b> mode more advanced diffraction based photo masks need to be used...|$|E
40|$|Mask aligner lithography, {{based on}} <b>shadow</b> <b>printing,</b> {{is one of}} the most natural {{approaches}} to micro-fabrication. For high-yield processing, however, contact-free proximity exposures are required, which have stringent resolution limitations. Therefore, resolution enhancement techniques (RETs) for proximity lithography have been a field of extensive research over the past four decades. Refinements like X-ray proximity lithography, near field holography (NFH), phase-shifting masks (PSM), Talbot lithography (TL), holographic lithography, displacement Talbot lithography (D-TL), and rigorously optimized phase-shifting masks (RO-PSM) have been proposed to combine flexible and economical process conditions with high resolution potential. In conjunction with ongoing technical innovations for the mask-to-substrate distance metrology, leveling, illumination optics, and photomask technology, the application potential of proximity lithography has extended significantly compared with the established process of <b>shadow</b> <b>printing.</b> This review provides a comprehensive overview of resolution enhancement techniques and technical innovations in mask aligner lithography, especially the fabrication of periodic structures for nano-optical components. The review concludes with a comparative discussion of the different techniques...|$|E

40|$|As {{predicted}} by Moore's law, {{the number of}} components in integrated circuits is ever-growing. Since the mid- 1970 s the need of smaller and smaller feature sizes in semiconductor manufacturing has encouraged {{the development of new}} technologies as Lithography Projection Systems. Nevertheless, because of its comparatively low cost of ownership, versatility and easy handling, many companies, research centres and universities still employ Mask Aligners. Advanced Mask Aligner Lithography (AMALITH) makes it possible to overcome some application limits for this technology, by introducing innovative concepts to <b>shadow</b> <b>printing.</b> This approach, in combination with lithography simulations, enables the use of Resolution Enhancement Technologies, already employed in front end processes. We will show some application of complex mask layers based on Diffractive Optical Elements (DOE) as Fresnel Zone Plates or Diffractive Beam Splitters for process quality improvement and control. Optical Proximity Correction (OPC), Source Mask Optimization (SMO) and Phase-Shift Masks (PSM) have been used for increasing the process window, the resolution and the accuracy of the resulting photoresist profile...|$|E
40|$|Mask {{aligners}} {{were the}} dominating lithography {{tool for the}} first 20 years of semiconductor industry. In the 1980 s industry changed over to projection lithography. However, mask aligners were never sorted out and still today hundreds of new mask aligners are sold each year. This continuing success of mask aligner lithography is due to two basic trends in lithography: (a) Costs for leading-edge lithography tools double approximately every 4. 4 years; and (b) the number of lithography steps per wafer was increasing from a few litho layers to more than 35 layers now. This explains why mask aligners, a very cost-effective solution for uncritical litho layers, are still widely used today. In over 50 years of semiconductor industry the mask aligner system has changed tremendously. However, only little effort was undertaken to improve the <b>shadow</b> <b>printing</b> process itself. We now present a new illumination system for mask aligners, the MO Exposure Optics (MOEO), {{which is based on}} t wo microlens-type Köhler integrators located in Fourier-conjugated planes. The optics stabilizes the illumination against misalignment of the lamp-to-ellipsoid position. It provides improved light uniformity, telecentric illumination and allows freely shaping the angular spectrum of the illumination light by spatial filtering. It significantly improves the CD uniformity, the yield in production and opens the door to a new era of Advanced Mask Aligner Lithography (AMALITH), where customized illumination, optical proximity correction (OPC), Talbot-lithography, phase shift masks (AAPSM) and source mask optimization (SMO) are introduced to mask aligner lithography...|$|E
40|$|Double-gate MOSFETs {{represent}} a significant solution to transistor scaling problems and promise a dramatic improvement in both performance and power consumption. In this work, a planar lithographic process is presented that {{is capable of}} producing double-gate MOSFET (DGFET) gate structures with 50 nm physical gate length and < 5 nm alignment between upper and lower gates. Because a self-aligned approach is not taken, the central challenge in fabrication is to define each gate in separate lithographic steps with precision alignment of upper to lower-gate masks. In order to obtain optimum device performance, the position of the lower-gate should be aligned to the upper-gate to better than 10 % of the gate length. The gates are defined using X-ray lithography (a close-proximity <b>shadow</b> <b>printing</b> scheme). The associated alignment scheme, Interferometric Broad Band Imaging (IBBI), has been proven to yield nanometer level sensitivity. While the IBBI alignment system offers superior alignment detectivity, it must be complemented by comparably successful mask pattern placement in order to yield structure details within the desired 5 nm tolerances. This work addresses the details of a novel mask design and fabrication scheme as well as its incorporation into the process flow of the DGFET. Additionally, the parasitic effects of strain that result from wafer bonding and thermal effects have been measured and analyzed. by Mitchell W. Meinhold. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Nanometer {{feature size}} {{lithography}} represents a major paradigm shift for the electronics and micro-electro-mechanical industries. In this paper, {{we discuss the}} capacity of dynamic focused reactive ion beam (FIB) etching systems to undertake direct and highly anisotropic erosion of thick evaporated gold coatings on boron-doped silicon X-ray mask membranes. FIB offers {{a new level of}} flexibility in micro fabrication, allowing for fast fabrication of X-ray masks, where pattern definition and surface alteration are combined in the same step which eliminates the whole lithographic process, in particular resist, resist development, electro-deposition and resist removal. Focused ion beam diameters as small as 7 nm can be obtained enabling fabrication well into the sub- 20 nm regime. In preliminary demonstrations of this X-ray mask fabrication technique 22 nm width lines were milled directly through 0. 9 microns of gold and a miniature mass spectrometer pattern was milled through over 0. 5 microns of gold. Also presented are the results of the <b>shadow</b> <b>printing,</b> using the large depth of field of synchrotron high energy parallel X-ray beam, of these and other sub-optical defined patterns in photoresist conformally coated over surfaces of extreme topographical variation. Assuming that electronic circuits and/or micro devices scale proportionally, the surface area of devices processed with X-ray lithography and 20 nm critical dimension X-ray masks would be 0. 5 % that of contemporary devices (350 nm CD). The 20 CD mask fabrication represents an initial effort - a further factor of three reduction is anticipated which represents a further order-of-magnitude reduction in die area...|$|E

Furthermore, the interest of visual cryptography can be increased by embedding the initial message in two shadow images that do not have identical mathematical supports, making manual registration impractical.

5|$|In the 1980s {{manufacturers}} such as Hummel and Adidas {{began to}} design shirts with increasingly intricate designs, as new technology {{led to the}} introduction of such design elements as <b>shadow</b> <b>prints</b> and pinstripes. Hummel's distinctive halved strip designed for the Danish national team for the 1986 FIFA World Cup caused a stir in the media but FIFA worried about moiré artefacts in television pictures. Shorts became shorter than ever during the 1970s and 1980s, and often included the player's number on the front. In the 1991 FA Cup Final Tottenham Hotspur's players lined up in long baggy shorts. Although, the new look was derided, clubs in Britain and elsewhere had within a short time adopted the longer shorts. In the 1990s shirt designs became increasingly complex, with many teams sporting extremely gaudy colour schemes. Design decisions were increasingly driven by the need for the shirt to look good when worn by fans as a fashion item, but many designs from this era have since come to be regarded as amongst the worst of all time. In 1996, Manchester United notoriously introduced a grey strip which had been specifically designed to look good when worn with jeans, but abandoned it halfway through a match after manager Alex Ferguson claimed that the reason why his team was losing 3–0 was that the players could not see each other on the pitch. United switched to different colours for the second half and scored one goal without reply. The leading leagues also introduced squad numbers, whereby each player is allocated a specific number for the duration of a season. A brief fad arose for players celebrating goals by lifting or completely removing their shirts to reveal political, religious or personal slogans printed on undershirts. This led to a ruling from the International Football Association Board in 2002 that undershirts must not contain slogans or logos; since 2004 it has been a bookable offence for players to remove their shirts.|$|R

60|$|Saturday.--A most {{beautiful}} day. We took a {{most beautiful}} drive, also up {{the banks of}} the river.

We passed a little family of children by the roadside. The youngest of all sat a good way apart from the others on the summit of a knoll; it was ensconced in an old tea-box, out of which issued its head and shoulders in a blue cloak and scarlet hat. O if you could have seen its dignity! It was deliciously humorous: and this little piece of comic self-satisfaction was framed in wonderfully by the hills and the sunlit estuary. We saw another child in a cottage garden. She had been sick, it seemed, and was taking the air quietly for health's sake. Over her pale face, she had decorated herself with all available flowers and weeds; and she was driving one chair as a horse, sitting in another by way of carriage. We cheered her as we passed, and she acknowledged the compliment like a queen. I like children better every day, I think, and most other things less. John Knox goes on, and a horrible story of a nurse which I think almost too cruel to go on with: I wonder why my stories are always so nasty.[18] I am still well, and in good spirits. I say, by the way, have you any means of finding Madame Garschine's address. If you have, communicate with me.
