50|$|Many {{variations}} of the Prins reaction exist because it lends itself easily to cyclization reactions {{and because it is}} possible to capture the oxo-carbenium ion with a large array of nucleophiles. The halo-Prins reaction is one such modification with replacement of protic acids and water by lewis acids such as <b>stannic</b> <b>chloride</b> and boron tribromide. The halogen is now the nucleophile recombining with the carbocation. The cyclization of certain allyl pulegones in scheme 7 with titanium tetrachloride in dichloromethane at −78 °C gives access to the decalin skeleton with the hydroxyl group and chlorine group predominantly in cis configuration (91% cis). This observed cis diastereoselectivity is due to the intermediate formation of a trichlorotitanium alkoxide making possible an easy delivery of chlorine to the carbocation ion from the same face. The trans isomer is preferred (98% cis) when the switch is made to a tin tetrachloride reaction at room temperature.|$|E

50|$|In 1989 and 1993, Yamada and {{co-workers}} reported the first enantioselective total synthesis {{of both the}} enantiomers of ptaquilosin, the aglycone of ptaquiloside. In the first step, the menthyl ester of cyclopentane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid 1 was partially hydrolyzed to afford the monomenthyl ester, which was later alkylated with methallyl bromide {{in the presence of}} HMPA to selectively produce 2. The product 2 was then converted to the acid chloride and treated with <b>stannic</b> <b>chloride</b> to effect Friedel-Crafts acylation to give enone 3. Hydride reduction, selective oxidation of the allylic alcohol, and silylation were then performed to provide compound 4. On treatment with base and a chloroethyl sulfonium salt, a mixture of spirocyclopropanes was obtained. The minor product 5a can be isomerized with p-toluenesulfonic acid to 5b with 81% yield. Desaturation by selenylation/dehydroselenation and basic peroxide oxidation afforded epoxide 6. Mild reduction, methyl Grignard addition, and oxidation gave compound 7. Methylation of the cyclopentanone under Noyori’s condition using the TASF enolate produced a mixture of isomers. The undesired isomer 8a can be equilibriumed with potassium tert-butoxide in 81% yield to exclusively generate 8b. Reduction, deprotection, and oxidation afforded 9. On treatment with oxygen in warm ethyl acetate, the aldehyde on 9 was oxidized to the acyl radical for decarbonylation. Stereoselective trapping of the tertiary radical by oxygen gave the hydroperoxide 10. Under mild reduction, the naturally occurred (-)-ptaquilosin 11 was obtained. The Yamada’s synthesis proceeded in 20 steps with an overall yield of 2.9%. Similarly, the unnatural (+)-enantiomer of ptaquilosin was synthesized from the diastereomer of 2.Multiple synthetic studies directed towards ptaquilosin 11 have been reported since 1989. In 1994, Padwa {{and co-workers}} described the synthesis of the core skeleton of ptaquilosin by a highly convergent approach.

40|$|Hydrogen {{chloride}} inhibits {{the long}} chain polymerisation of styrene catalysed by <b>stannic</b> <b>chloride.</b> Styrene reacts with hydrogen chloride {{in the presence}} of <b>stannic</b> <b>chloride</b> and in carbon tetrachloride medium to form [alpha]-phenylethyl chloride and low molecular weight polymers. To support the main kinetic investigations the products to the reaction have been examined. The reactions are compared with the short chain polymerisation of styrene {{in the presence of}} strong acids and are consistent with the mechanism in which a proton,derived from the interaction of hydrogen chloride and stannic chloride,attaches itself to the styrene molecule or may grow by the accretion of monomeric styrene until stabilised to form short chain polymers. The reaction rate is measured by following the fall in styrene concentration. It is shown that, provided the hydrogen chloride is initially in excess over styrene and <b>stannic</b> <b>chloride,</b> some simple kinetic relationships are discernible. The effects of varying the styrene and catalyst concentrations are investigated by 'flow' experiments. It appears that the addition is first order with respect to styrene and there is good evidence to show that over the range of styrene concentration 0. 05 to 0. 2 M the rate of consumption is proportional to the concentration of styrene. Also up to 0. 015 M <b>stannic</b> <b>chloride</b> the first order reaction constant k is directly proportional to the catalyst concentration. However above 0. 015 M this simple relationship does not hold. At high styrene concentration the experimental evidence is conflicting. There is some evidence that there is a lowering of the reaction order, but on the occasions when the reaction obeys the usual first order reaction, k, is proportional to the square of the catalyst concentration. Experiments varying the initial hydrogen chloride concentration show that the rate of consumption of styrene is proportional to the hydrogen chloride concentration provided the latter is in excess over styrene and <b>stannic</b> <b>chloride.</b> However when the <b>stannic</b> <b>chloride</b> chloride becomes equal to or falls below the acid concentration there is again a lowering of the reaction order. The simple thoery mentioned earlier is discussed in the light of kinetic evidence. The catalyst may form a complex with (a) hydrogen chloride (b) styrene but kinetic evidence does not clearly between the alternatives, (a) is favoured when the hydrogen chloride is in considerable excess over styrene and <b>stannic</b> <b>chloride.</b> However,its application is limited and as styrene or <b>stannic</b> <b>chloride</b> increase in concentration it is probable that the styrene complex plays a part. Also the reaction is complicated by the formation of low polymers. <p...|$|E
