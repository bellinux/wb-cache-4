40|$|An {{empirical}} formula for the steady state drag coefficient of a 20 degree conical ribbon parachute is developed. The derived expression {{takes into account}} the effect of suspension line length and geometric porosity within the limits of practical design. Also included are factors which provide drag reduction due to <b>skirt</b> <b>reefing</b> and the wake behind a primary body. The calculated values are in agreement with the available experimental results...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a study of <b>skirt</b> <b>reefing</b> line tension for very low-porosity parachutes. In {{particular}} we show how much higher such tensions can be in comparison to that sustained by line-reefing the skirts of high-porosity canopies. Line tensions are calculated here for G- 12 and G- 11 canopies that were not only skirt-reefed, but also rigged for complete closure of their apex vent. Our derivations also yield interesting estimates of the worst possible line reefing tension ratio T/FD obtainable, namely 16. 2 % for long reefing lines and 22. 5 % for short ones. Finally, we present a simple approach for recasting line tensions, obtained via either calculations or wind tunnel measurements, in a way that takes into account the possible deceleration of parachute–payload systems...|$|E
60|$|An {{exclamation from}} the blacks for'ard sent both men glancing seaward. Around the near point of land, {{a quarter of}} a mile away and <b>skirting</b> the <b>reef,</b> a long black canoe paddled into sight.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Shipmates ahoy! how are you, my loves?' and Amanda appeared, rosy, calm, and gay, {{with her}} pea-jacket on, <b>skirts</b> close <b>reefed,</b> hat well to windward, and {{everything}} taut and ship-shape; {{for she was}} a fine sailor, and never missed a meal.|$|R
40|$|Reefing {{lines are}} an {{essential}} feature to manage inflation loads. During each Engineering Development Unit (EDU) {{test of the}} Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS), a chase aircraft is staged to be level with the cluster of Main ringsail parachutes during the initial inflation and reefed stages. This allows for capturing high-quality still photographs of the <b>reefed</b> <b>skirt,</b> suspension line, and canopy geometry. The over-inflation angles are synchronized with measured loads data in order to compute the tension force in the reefing line. The traditional reefing tension equation assumes radial symmetry, but cluster effects cause the <b>reefed</b> <b>skirt</b> of each parachute to elongate to a more elliptical shape. This effect was considered in evaluating multiple parachutes to estimate the semi-major and semi-minor axes. Three flight tests are assessed, including one with a skipped first stage, which had peak reefing line tension over three {{times higher than the}} nominal parachute disreef sequence...|$|R
50|$|After {{shakedown}} out of New London, Gabilan sailed {{for brief}} antisubmarine training at Key West before transiting the Panama Canal for the Hawaiian Islands. She arrived Pearl Harbor 23 March 1944 and spent her first war patrol (21 April - 6 June) scouting the Mariana Islands gathering {{information for the}} United States invasion of those islands. Her second war patrol (29 June - 18 August) {{took her to the}} south coast of Honshū, Japan, where, on the night of 17 July, she made a daring radar chase through bright moonlight and phosphorescent water. <b>Skirting</b> dangerous <b>reefs</b> and shoals, she pressed home an attack that sank a 492-ton minesweeper.|$|R
60|$|In the SOUTHERN PARTS of the Red Sea, {{considerable}} {{spaces of}} the mainland, and {{of some of the}} Dhalac islands, are <b>skirted</b> by <b>reefs,</b> which, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, are of living coral, and have all the characters of the fringing class. As in these latitudes, there are no outlying linear or sickle-formed reefs, rising out of unfathomable depths, I have coloured these parts of the coast red. On similar grounds, I have coloured red the NORTHERN PARTS OF THE WESTERN COAST (north of latitude 24 deg 30'), and likewise the shores of the chief part of the GULF OF SUEZ. In the GULF OF ACABA, as I am informed by Captain Moresby there are no coral-reefs, and the water is profoundly deep.|$|R
60|$|Dick nodded {{agreement}} and signed the fireman {{to turn on}} more steam as he followed the tug outshore. The swell got steadily higher and broke in angry surges. The launch plunged, and rattled as she swung her screw out of the sea, but Dick kept his course abreast of the tug, which he could only distinguish at intervals between the clouds of spray. Her masthead lights reeled wildly to and fro, but the low red gleam from the barges was hidden {{and he began to}} wonder why her captain was steering out so far. It was prudent not to <b>skirt</b> the <b>reef,</b> but the fellow seemed to be giving it unnecessary room. The lighters would tow badly through the white, curling sea, and there was a risk of the hawsers breaking. Besides, the engineer had complained that his machinery was not running well.|$|R
