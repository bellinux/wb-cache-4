50|$|Industrial {{observational}} instruments {{have changed}} with industry itself. More structurally sophisticated than the water gauge, the contemporary <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> — {{also called the}} sight window or sight port — {{can be found on}} the media vessel at chemical plants and in other industrial settings, including pharmaceutical, food, beverage and bio gas plants. <b>Sight</b> <b>glasses</b> enable operators to visually observe processes inside tanks, pipes, reactors and vessels. The modern industrial <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> is a glass disk held between two metal frames, which are secured by bolts and gaskets, or the glass disc is fused to the metal frame during manufacture. The glass used for this purpose is either soda lime glass or borosilicate glass, and the metal, usually a type of stainless steel, is chosen for desired properties of strength. Borosilicate glass is superior to other formulations in terms of chemical corrosion resistance and temperature tolerance, as well as transparency. Fused <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are also called mechanically prestressed glass, because the glass is strengthened by compression of the metal ring. Heat is applied to a glass disc and its surrounding steel ring, causing a fusion of the materials. As the steel cools, it contracts, compressing the glass and making it resistant to tension. Because glass typically breaks under tension, mechanically prestressed glass is unlikely to break and endanger workers. The strongest <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are made with borosilicate glass, because of the greater difference in its coefficient of expansion.|$|R

50|$|The {{one piece}} {{lubricator}} {{body is a}} gunmetal casting and incorporates the condensing chamber, the oil reservoir and the <b>sight</b> <b>glasses.</b> Passages within the body interconnect these areas. The body is fitted with a steam valve, a water valve, an oil control valve. <b>Sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are fitted at the front & back of the body {{on each of the}} feeds, these feeds are fitted with individual feed regulating valves for controlling the feed rate for each outlet. The oil control valve was used to either turn the supply off/on, or to shut off the supply to the cylinders and just supply the air compressor with oil whilst the locomotive is stationary on lubricators with a center feed. Each feed is also fitted with a drain valve for cleaning each <b>sight</b> <b>glass.</b> The body is also fitted with an oil chamber drain for draining the condensed water from the oil chamber.|$|R
