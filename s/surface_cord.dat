40|$|The {{invention}} is {{a system}} for automatically controlling the surface contour of a deployable and restowable antenna having a mesh reflector surface supported by a circular, folding hoop affixed to a central, telescoping column. The antenna, when deployed, forms a quad-aperture reflector with each quadrant of the mesh surface shaped to provide an offset parabolic radio frequency (RF) reflector. The hoop is supported and positioned by quartz support cords attached {{to the top of}} a column and by lower graphite hoop control cords that extend between the hoop and base of the column. The antenna, an RF reflective surface, is a gold plated molybdenum wire mesh supported on a graphite cord truss structure that includes the hoop control cords and a plurality of <b>surface</b> control <b>cords</b> attached at selected points on the surface and to the base of the column. The contour of the three-dimensional surface of the antenna is controlled by selectively adjusting the lengths of the <b>surface</b> control <b>cords</b> and the graphite hoop control cords by means of novel actuator assemblies that automatically sense and change the lengths of the lower hoop control <b>cords</b> and <b>surface</b> control <b>cords...</b>|$|R

40|$|By {{electrically}} {{stimulating the}} spinal cord, {{it is possible}} to activate functional populations of neurons that modulate motor and sensory function. One method for accessing these neurons is via their associated axons, which project as functionally segregated longitudinal columns of white-matter funiculi (i. e., spinal tracts). To stimulate spinal tracts without penetrating the cord, we have recently developed technology that enables close-proximity, multi-electrode contact with the spinal <b>cord</b> <b>surface.</b> Our stretchable microelectrode arrays (sMEAs) are fabricated using an elastomer polydimethylsiloxane substrate and can be wrapped circumferentially around the spinal cord to optimize electrode contact. Here, sMEAs were used to stimulate the surfaces of rat spinal cords maintained in vitro, and their ability to selectively activate axonal surface tracts was compared to rigid bipolar tungsten microelectrodes pressed firmly onto the <b>cord</b> <b>surface.</b> Along dorsal column tracts, the axonal response to sMEA stimulation was compared to that evoked by rigid microelectrodes through measurement of their evoked axonal compound action potentials (CAPs). Paired t-tests failed to reveal significant differences between the sMEA’s and the rigid microelectrode’s stimulus resolution, or in their ranges of evoked CAP conduction velocities. Additionally, dual-site stimulation using sMEA electrodes recruited spatially distinct populations of spinal axons. Site-specific stimulation of the ventrolateral funiculus – a tract capable of evoking locomotor-like activity – recruited ventral root efferent activity that spanned several spinal segments. These findings indicate that the sMEA stimulates the spinal <b>cord</b> <b>surface</b> with selectivity similar to that of rigid microelectrodes, while possessing potential advantages concerning circumferential contact and mechanical compatibility with the <b>cord</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|R
5000|$|A cord factor {{molecule}} {{is composed}} of a trehalose sugar, a disaccharide, that is esterified to two mycolic acid residues. One of the two mycolic acid residues {{is attached to the}} sixth carbon of one monosaccharide, while the other mycolic acid residue is attached to the sixth carbon of the other monosaccharide. Therefore, cord factor is also named trehalose-6,6'-dimycolate. The carbon chain of the mycolic acid residues vary in length depending on the species of bacteria it is found in, but the general range is 20 to 80 carbon atoms. Cord factor's amphiphilic nature leads to varying structures when many cord factor molecules are in close proximity. On a hydrophobic surface, they spontaneously form a crystalline monolayer. This crystalline monolayer is extremely durable and firm; it is stronger than any other amphiphile found in biology. [...] This monolayer also forms in oil-water, plastic-water, and air-water surfaces. In an aqueous environment free of hydrophobic <b>surfaces,</b> <b>cord</b> factor forms a micelle. [...] Furthermore, cord factor interlocks with lipoarabinomannan (LAM), which is found on the surface of M. tuberculosis cells as well, to form an asymmetrical bilayer.|$|R

RFL treatment is most commonly used to achieve rubber-fiber adhesion for decades; however, there are health concerns related to this method. Therefore, alternative methods to partly or completely replace the RFL treatment are currently developed. A new approach for adhesion enhancement is plasma treatment of the fiber/cord. This process allows to physically and chemically modify the <b>cord</b> <b>surface</b> and thus to increase compatibility with and reactivity towards the elastomeric matrix. In this study, an atmospheric plasma jet was used to coat polymeric <b>cord</b> <b>surfaces</b> with an adhesive layer in a pilot-scale continuously operating line.

40|$|International audienceMajor {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) class I-specific inhibitory natural killer receptors (iNKRs) are expressed by subsets of T cells but the mechanisms inducing their expression are poorly understood, particularly for killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). The iNKRs are virtually {{absent from the}} <b>surface</b> of <b>cord</b> blood T cells but we found that KIR expression could be induced upon interleukin- 2 stimulation in vitro. In addition, KIR expression was enhanced after treatment with 5 -aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine, suggesting a role for DNA methylation. In vivo induction of KIR expression on cord blood T cells was also observed during a human congenital infection with Trypanosoma cruzi which triggers activation of fetal CD 8 (+) T cells. These KIR(+) T cells had an effector and effector/memory phenotype suggesting that KIR expression was consecutive to the antigenic stimulation; however, KIR was not preferentially found on parasite-specific CD 8 (+) T cells secreting interferon-gamma upon in vitro restimulation with live T. cruzi. These findings show that KIR expression is likely regulated by epigenetic mechanisms that occur during the maturation process of cord blood T cells.

40|$|In the rat lumbar ventral {{spinal nerve}} rootlets, the central-peripheral {{transition}} {{occurs at the}} surface of a distal projection of central tissue into the rootlet. This changes considerably in appearance during development. In the first week after birth, it grows distally into the rootlet to form an irregular, tapering projection. In the second week after birth, it is retracted and becomes splayed out; its distal surface is irregular and lies just above the surrounding spinal cord. After this, it again grows distally into the rootlet. It forms a tapering projection which generally lies eccentrically in the rootlet, most often towards its dorsal surface. The central ends of the proximal transitional myelinated peripheral internodes generally lie in grooves {{on the surface of the}} central tissue projection. However, for a time during the second week after birth, many lie in invaginations into it. Occasional invaginations of the central tissue projection contain large numbers of collagen fibres rather than axons. A ring of collagen fibres surrounds the rootlet immediately distal to its attachment to the <b>cord</b> <b>surface.</b> Though the central tissue projection contains occasional astrocytic perikarya, it consists mostly of closely interwoven astrocyte processes derived from cell bodies situated at the <b>cord</b> <b>surface</b> surrounding the rootlet attachment. Changes in the form and size of the central tissue projection probably result largely from active growth and reorganisation of astrocyte processes. The barrier which these processes constitute probably prevents invasion of the cord by transitional Schwann cells. Before the central tissue projection develops, such invasion is probably prevented by the arrangement of transitional Schwann cells as a close-knit epithelium on the surface of the rootlet. The central tissue projection of ventral rootlets is smaller, more irregular in shape and less highly organised than that of dorsal rootlets. Central-peripheral transitional nodes lie close to the surface of the central tissue projection. They are therefore offset relative to one another and so are less likely to discharge one another. This arrangement may also protect the rootlet against mechanical damage due to traction...|$|R

This study aims to {{gain insight into}} the role of live parasites and intracellular infection in mDC activation using CSFE-labelled parasites. First, we observed that only a low proportion of mDCs was infected by T. cruzi after overnight culture of whole blood samples and trypomastigotes, as compared with monocytes and granulocytes. Cord blood mDCs were also less infected than their adult counterpart. Second, expression levels of HLA-DR and co-stimulatory molecules CD 80, CD 83 and CD 86 were similar on infected and uninfected mDCs. Parasite lysate also triggered mDCs phenotypic maturation of both cord and adult blood cells, though in a lower extent than live parasites. These results strongly support a central role for extracellular trypomastigotes in activation of mDCs when parasites are incubated with whole blood cells.
