5|$|Already in 1951, {{relationships}} {{had deteriorated}} enough for Pollock, Newman, Still and Rothko to approach Betty Parsons {{with the idea}} of showing them exclusively, effectively leaving their erstwhile colleagues to fend for themselves. She declined the offer. Over the following three years Pollock, Still and Rothko moved to the Sidney Janis Gallery. After the failure of fellow artists to defend his show at Betty Parsons in 1951 and not been included in the 1952 Fifteen Americans show at the Museum of Modern Art, Newman did not <b>show</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> again until 1959.|$|E
5|$|The Master and Mistress enter Lad in the Westminster Dog <b>Show</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> much to Lad's abject misery as he dislikes the preparatory bathing and brushing.

To their joy, Lad wins the blue ribbon in both the Novice and Winner classes, and they decide not to subject him to the four-day stay. When they let Lad know he is going home, he joyfully perks up.|$|E

5|$|At mid-season, WCBS {{announced}} {{that for the}} 2003–04 season it had acquired the broadcast rights to The People's Court after WNBC, which had been airing the revived series since its 1997 debut, dropped it from its lineup. WCBS announced plans to move The People's Court into the time slot that was occupied by Millionaire and the still-airing 4:30 pm local newscast once it joined the station's lineup in September 2003. This led to speculation that the syndicated Millionaire would not be returning for a second season, and BVT's concerns over losing its New York affiliate were {{compounded by the fact}} that there were not many time slots available for the <b>show</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> outside of the undesirable late-night slots that syndicators try to avoid.|$|E
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century {{movement}} {{in the tradition of}} European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory <b>Show</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene. Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.|$|E
