ObjectivesWe assessed the relationship between profusion of fibroblast foci and survival in 43 patients with IPF seen at a tertiary referral medical center from 1996 to 2002. MethodsFibroblast foci in <b>surgical</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> were counted using a systematic morphometric point-counting technique. Patients with either clinical or pathologic evidence of accelerated disease were excluded from analysis. The association of fibroblast counts with survival was assessed using proportional hazards regression. ResultsThe mean age (±SD) of the study population was 64 ± 9 years; 26 (60 %) patients were male. The mean (%±SD) profusion of fibroblastic foci was 0. 6 ± 0. 7, expressed {{as a percentage of}} total points counted. Fibroblast foci counts did not differ markedly between upper, middle, and lower lobes. Median survival from the time of biopsy was 2. 4 years; there were 25 (58 %) deaths in the follow up period. There was no significant relationship between profusion of fibroblast foci and survival in the overall group (p= 0. 250).

40|$|Telomerase is {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes the {{addition}} of nucleotides {{on the ends of}} chromosomes. Rare loss of function mutations in the gene that encodes the protein component of telomerase (TERT) have been described in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Here we examine the telomere lengths and pulmonary fibrosis phenotype seen in multiple kindreds with heterozygous TERT mutations. We have identified 134 individuals with heterozygous TERT mutations from 21 unrelated families. Available medical records, <b>surgical</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> and radiographs were evaluated retrospectively. Genomic DNA isolated from circulating leukocytes has been used to measure telomere lengths with a quantitative PCR assay. We find that telomere lengths of TERT mutation carriers decrease in an age-dependent manner and show progressive shortening with successive generations of mutation inheritance. Family members without TERT mutations have a shorter mean telomere length than normal, demonstrating epigenetic inheritance of shortened telomere lengths {{in the absence of an}} inherited TERT mutation. Pulmonary fibrosis is an age-dependent phenotype not seen in mutation carriers less than 40 years of age but found in 60 % of men 60 years or older; its development is associated with environmental exposures including cigarette smoking. A radiographic CT pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which is consistent with a diagnosis of IPF, is seen in 74 % of cases and a pathologic pattern of UIP is seen in 86 % of <b>surgical</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Pulmonary fibrosis associated with TERT mutations is progressive and lethal with a mean survival of 3 years after diagnosis. Overall, TERT mutation carriers demonstrate reduced life expectancy, with a mean age of death of 58 and 67 years for males and females, respectively. A subset of pulmonary fibrosis, like dyskeratosis congenita, bone marrow failure, and liver disease, represents a "telomeropathy" caused by germline mutations in telomerase and characterized by short telomere lengths.

The different BAL patterns were accompanied by distinct radiographic findings. Both patients significantly improved after etanercept discontinuation and corticosteroid initiation. We propose that EILI can present with distinct immunologic and radiographic phenotypes.

5000|$|IPF {{belongs to}} {{a large group of}} more than 200 lung {{diseases}} known as interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), characterized by the involvement of lung interstitium. The interstitium, the tissue between the air sacs in the lung, is the primary site of injury in ILDs. However, these disorders frequently affect not only the interstitium, but also the airspaces, peripheral airways, and vessels. Lung tissue from people with IPF shows a characteristic histopathologic pattern known as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). UIP is therefore the pathologic counterpart of IPF. [...] The term 'idiopathic' is used because the cause of pulmonary fibrosis is still unknown. IPF usually occurs in adults of between 50 and 70 years of age, particularly those with a history of cigarette smoking, and affects more men than women. The diagnosis of IPF requires exclusion of other known causes of ILDs and the presence of a typical radiological pattern identified through high resolution computed tomography (HRCT).

Methods: Cells were isolated from <b>surgical</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> of 8 HSCT-patients with BOS. Proliferation was assessed by [3 H]-thymidine-incorporation. Results: Biopsies revealed constrictive BO in 3 and lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB) in 5 patients.

Between January 7, 1991, and August 3, 1993, 71 consecutive patients had video-assisted thoracic <b>surgical</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy</b> and 42 patients had traditional open lung biopsy. A specific histologic diagnosis that correlated with the clinical findings was sought in each case and the yield was compared between the two groups. Procedure-related artifactual changes were also evaluated; the extent of traumatic hemorrhage and neutrophil margination {{as a result of}} tissue manipulation was significantly greater for patients in the video-assisted thoracic <b>surgical</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy</b> group than for those in the open lung biopsy group, but the changes were generally minor and did not affect diagnostic yield.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis exhibits differential progression {{from the time}} of diagnosis but the molecular basis for varying progression rates is poorly understood. The aim {{of the present study was}} to ascertain whether differential miRNA expression might provide one explanation for rapidly versus slowly progressing forms of IPF. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: miRNA and mRNA were isolated from <b>surgical</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> from IPF patients with a clinically documented rapid or slow course of disease over the first year after diagnosis. A quantitative PCR miRNA array containing 88 of the most abundant miRNA in the human genome was used to profile <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> from 9 patients with rapidly progressing IPF, 6 patients with slowly progressing IPF, and 10 normal <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Using this approach, 11 miRNA were significantly increased and 36 were significantly decreased in rapid biopsies compared with normal biopsies. Slowly progressive biopsies exhibited 4 significantly increased miRNA and 36 significantly decreased miRNA compared with normal lung. Among the miRNA present in IPF with validated mRNA targets were those with regulatory effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Five miRNA (miR- 302 c, miR- 423 - 5 p, miR- 210, miR- 376 c, and miR- 185) were significantly increased in rapid compared with slow IPF <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Additional analyses of rapid biopsies and fibroblasts grown from the same biopsies revealed that the expression of AGO 1 and AGO 2 (essential components of the miRNA processing RISC complex) were lower compared with either slow or normal <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> and fibroblasts.

40|$|Telomere {{maintenance}} dysfunction {{has been}} implicated in the pathogenesis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). However, the mechanism of how telomere length is related to fibrosis in the <b>lungs</b> is unknown. <b>Surgical</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> of IPF patients typically show a heterogeneous pattern of non-fibrotic and fibrotic areas. Therefore, telomere length (TL) in both lung areas of patients with IPF and familial interstitial pneumonia was compared, specifically in alveolar type 2 (AT 2) cells. Fluorescent in situ hybridization {{was used to determine}} TL in non-fibrotic and fibrotic areas of 35 subjects. Monochrome multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (MMqPCR) was used for 51 whole <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> and blood TL measurements. For sporadic IPF subjects, AT 2 cell TL in non-fibrotic areas was 56 % longer than in fibrotic areas. No such difference was observed in the surrounding lung cells. In subjects carrying a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) mutation, AT 2 cell TL was significantly shorter than in sporadic subjects. However, no difference in surrounding cell TL was observed between these subject groups. Finally, using biopsy MMqPCR TL measurements, it was determined that IPF subjects with shortest lung TL had a significantly worse survival than patients with long TL. This study shows that shortening of telomeres critically affects AT 2 cells in fibrotic areas, implying TL as a cause of fibrogenesis.

METHODS: We reviewed all consecutive cases of patients with ARDS who underwent a surgical OLB at the bedside in a medical intensive care unit between 1993 and 2005. RESULTS: Biopsies were performed in 19 patients mechanically ventilated for ARDS of unknown etiology despite extensive diagnostic process and empirical therapeutic trials. Among them, 17 (89 %) were immunocompromised and 10 patients experienced hematological malignancies. Surgical biopsies were obtained after a median (25 %- 75 %) mechanical ventilation of 5 (2 - 11) days; mean (+/-SD) Pao(2) /Fio(2) ratio was 119. 3 (+/- 34. 2) mm Hg. Histologic diagnoses were obtained in all cases and were specific in 13 patients (68 %), including 9 (47 %) not previously suspected. Immediate complications (26 %) were local (pneumothorax, minimal bleeding) without general or respiratory consequences. The biopsy resulted in major changes in management in 17 patients (89 %).

Our objectives were to address the properties of a <b>surgical</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy</b> for suspected interstitial lung disease, the diagnostic yield of the procedure, and whether it resulted in changes in diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: A retrospective nationwide study including 73 patients (mean age, 57. 3 years; 58 % males) who underwent a <b>surgical</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy</b> for suspected interstitial disease in Iceland between 1986 and 2007 was conducted. Patient records and histologic specimens were reviewed. Before the surgical biopsy a transbronchial or computed tomography-guided biopsy had been performed in two thirds of the patients. RESULTS: The complication rate for <b>surgical</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy</b> was 16 %, and 30 -day operative mortality was 2. 7 %, both significantly higher in patients with preoperative respiratory failure. After the procedure, a definite histopathologic diagnosis was obtained in 81 % of the patients. Usual interstitial pneumonia was the most common diagnosis (31 %).

Approximately 5 % of transgenic mice overexpressing S 100 A 4 /Mts 1 develop pulmonary arterial changes resembling human plexogenic arteriopathy with intimal hyperplasia leading to occlusion of the arterial lumen. To assess the pathophysiological significance of this observation, immunohistochemistry was applied to quantitatively analyze S 100 A 4 /Mts 1 expression in pulmonary arteries in <b>surgical</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> from children with pulmonary hypertension secondary to congenital heart disease. S 100 A 4 /Mts 1 was not detected in pulmonary arteries with low-grade hypertensive lesions but was expressed in smooth muscle cells of lesions showing neointimal formation and with increased intensity in vessels with an occlusive neointima and plexiform lesions. Putative downstream targets of S 100 A 4 /Mts 1 include Bax, which is pro-apoptotic, and the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The increase in S 100 A 4 /Mts 1 expression precedes heightened expression of Bax in progressively severe neointimal lesions but in non-S 100 A 4 /Mts 1 -expressing cells. VEGF immunoreactivity did not correlate with severity of disease. The relationship of increased S 100 A 4 /Mts 1 to pathologically similar lesions in the transgenic mice and patients occurs despite differences in localization (endothelial versus smooth muscle cells) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an unusual case of severe pulmonary bullous disease developing during treatment of marginal zone B-Cell lymphoma (MALT) involving the pulmonary parenchyma. The patient originally presented with pneumonia-like symptoms along with hemoptysis and {{was diagnosed with}} MALT lymphoma after a video-assisted thoracic <b>surgical</b> (VATS) <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Computed tomography (CT) of the chest at diagnosis revealed multiple opacities, but no bullous disease. During the ensuing 4 years, and while on chemotherapy for the MALT lymphoma, sequential CT and pulmonary function tests revealed the development of progressive bullous disease resulting in the replacement of large portions of the lung parenchyma with bilateral bullae. This complication is rare, has been reported only once before in a patient with concomitant amyloidosis, and {{may be related to}} activation of proteolytic enzymes by lymphoma cells or chemotherapeutic agents...|$|R
