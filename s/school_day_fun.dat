40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} longer <b>school</b> <b>days</b> on student achievement in Colombia. To identify the impact of longer <b>schools</b> <b>days,</b> this study exploits plausibly exogenous within school variation in {{the length of the}} <b>school</b> <b>day.</b> Using test score data from 5 th and 9 th graders in 2002, 2005, and 2009, along with school administrative data, this research uses school fixed effects models to estimate variation in average test scores across cohorts for schools that switched from a half <b>school</b> <b>day</b> to a full <b>school</b> <b>day</b> or vice versa. I find that cohorts exposed to full <b>school</b> <b>days</b> have test scores that are about one tenth of a standard deviation higher than cohorts that attended half <b>school</b> <b>days.</b> The impact of attending full <b>school</b> <b>days</b> is larger for math than for language, and it is larger for 9 th grade than for 5 th grade. Effects are largest among the poorest schools and those in rural areas. The results suggest that lengthening the <b>school</b> <b>day</b> may be an effective policy for increasing student achievement, particularly for the lowest-income students in Colombia and other developing countries...|$|R
