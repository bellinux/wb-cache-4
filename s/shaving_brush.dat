5000|$|Modern <b>shave</b> <b>brushes</b> {{are similar}} in appearance, {{composition}} and function to their centuries-old predecessors. Although {{a variety of different}} materials are still used to fashion <b>shave</b> <b>brush</b> handles, synthetic handles of nylon, urethane or plastic are the most common even by the most expensive <b>shave</b> <b>brush</b> manufacturers. Benefits of synthetic handles include a lesser chance of breakage and resistance to damage by moisture. [...] A limited number of consumers [...] prefer natural materials such as wood or exotic materials such as tortoise shell. A <b>shave</b> <b>brush's</b> handle, regardless of its material composition, rarely affects the overall performance of the brush.|$|R

40|$|During the First World War, anthrax {{cases in}} the United States and England {{increased}} greatly {{and seemed to be}} associated with use of new <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes.</b> Further investigation revealed that the source material and origin of <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes</b> had changed during the war. Cheap brushes of imported horsehair were being made to look like the preferred badger-hair brushes. Unfortunately, some of these brushes were not effectively disinfected and brought with them a nasty stowaway: Bacillus anthracis. A review of outbreak summaries, surveillance data, and case reports indicated that these cases originated from the use of ineffectively disinfected animal-hair <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes.</b> This historical information is relevant to current public health practice because renewed interest in vintage and animal-hair <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes</b> has been seen in popular culture. This information should help healthcare providers and public health officials answer questions on this topic. 28418302 PMC 540302...|$|R

6000|$|This washhandstand {{had been}} made of deal by some one with an excess of turnery {{appliances}} in a hurry, who had tried to distract attention from the rough economies of his workmanship by an arresting ornamentation of blobs and bulbs upon the joints and legs. Apparently the piece had then been placed in the hands of some person of infinite leisure equipped with a pot of ocherous paint, varnish, and a set of flexible combs. This person had first painted the article, then, I fancy, smeared it with varnish, and then sat down to work with the combs to streak and comb the varnish into a weird imitation of the grain of some nightmare timber. The washhandstand so made had evidently had a prolonged career of violent use, had been chipped, kicked, splintered, punched, stained, scorched, hammered, dessicated, damped, and defiled, had met indeed with almost every possible adventure except a conflagration or a scrubbing, until at last it had come to this high refuge of Parload's attic to sustain the simple requirements of Parload's personal cleanliness. There were, in chief, a basin and a jug of water and a slop-pail of tin, and, further, a piece of yellow soap in a tray, a tooth-brush, a rat-tailed <b>shaving</b> <b>brush,</b> one huckaback towel, and one or two other minor articles. In those days only very prosperous people had more than such an equipage, and it is to be remarked that every drop of water Parload used had to be carried by an unfortunate servant girl,--the [...] "slavey," [...] Parload called her--up from the basement {{to the top of the}} house and subsequently down again. Already we begin to forget how modern an invention is personal cleanliness. It is a fact that Parload had never stripped for a swim in his life; never had a simultaneous bath all over his body since his childhood.

50|$|The hair of the European badger {{has been}} used for centuries for making sporrans and high end <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes.</b> Sporrans are {{traditionally}} worn as part of male Scottish highland dress. They form a bag or pocket made from a pelt and a badger or other animal's mask may be used as a flap. Compared to the fur of other animals, badger's hair is ideal for <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes</b> because it retains the hot water that needs to be applied to the skin while wet <b>shaving.</b> Although some <b>brushes</b> are made from wild badger hair, most hair is sourced from China where badgers are farmed for this purpose. The pelt was also formerly used for pistol furniture.|$|R
40|$|The Eurasian badger (Meles meles) is {{included}} in Appendix III of the Bern Convention and protected by national laws in many European countries. Badger hair is used to manufacture luxury <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes,</b> although it is frequently argued that the hog badger (Arctonyx collaris), which in Europe is an introduced and unprotected species, is {{the origin of the}} hair used. We applied an extraction protocol to recover DNA from the unrooted hair of <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes</b> obtained from commercial companies in The Netherlands and Spain. The tested brushes originated from The Netherlands, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom where the Eurasian badger is a protected species. We sequenced 191 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region and 170 bp of the cytochrome b gene and compared the sequences obtained with Eurasian badger and hog badger reference sequences of the same mitochondrial DNA regions obtained in our laboratory and from GenBank. Sequences obtained from four <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes</b> were clearly hog badger sequences, whereas four sequences clustered with Eurasian badger sequences of both European and Asian origins. One of the <b>shaving</b> <b>brushes</b> made of Eurasian badger was produced in France, where it is legal to capture or trade the species under certain conditions. The remaining three brushes originated from The Netherlands, where it is illegal to possess, sell, transport or use for commercial purposes dead Eurasian badgers or products derived from them.
