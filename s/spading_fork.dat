25|$|Due to {{custom and}} the {{perceived}} high costs of good equipment, even relatively large plots of land are often cultivated manually using equipment such as a spade or a <b>spading</b> <b>fork.</b> In autumn the grown potatoes and other crops are gathered and transported to the city where they are stored in cellars, dugouts (usually located on unused plots of ground), or in personal automobile garages.|$|E
2500|$|At harvest time, gardeners usually dig up {{potatoes}} with a long-handled, three-prong [...] "grape" [...] (or graip), i.e., a <b>spading</b> <b>fork,</b> or a potato hook, {{which is similar}} to the graip but with tines at a 90° angle to the handle. In larger plots, the plow is the fastest implement for unearthing potatoes. Commercial harvesting is typically done with large potato harvesters, which scoop up the plant and surrounding earth. This is transported up an apron chain consisting of steel links several feet wide, which separates some of the dirt. The chain deposits into an area where further separation occurs. Different designs use different systems at this point. The most complex designs use vine choppers and shakers, along with a blower system to separate the potatoes from the plant. The result is then usually run past workers who continue to sort out plant material, stones, and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are continuously delivered to a wagon or truck. Further inspection and separation occurs when the potatoes are unloaded from the field vehicles and put into storage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{not afraid}} of a man," [...] {{declared}} the girl, much relieved, and even as she spoke the Royal Gardener popped into the greenhouse--a <b>spading</b> <b>fork</b> {{in one hand and}} a watering pot in the other.|$|E
50|$|In 1905 year red emissaries came to {{the village}} from Malosofiivka {{with the aim of}} distributing leaflets. They urged villagers to smash aristocratic estates. Among those who joined these calls - S. Shcherbakov, K. Kolesnik T. Dorozhon. The village head Pylypenko made a list of rebels and sent it to Sofiivka for an officer Burilov. Soon gendarmes arrived in the village. But the {{residents}} of Engelhardt-Vasylivka with <b>spading</b> <b>forks</b> in their hands surrounded the gendarmes and tore the list. Then the Police {{came to the}} aid with hundreds of Russian Cossacks. There was a tough massacre of rebellious peasants. the organizers of the rebellion were whipped with rods, Dorozhona T. and K. Kolesnik were thrown into prison.|$|R

5000|$|In double digging, a 12-inch (305 mm) deep trench is dug {{across the}} width of the bed with a flat spade, and the soil from that first trench is set aside. The 12 inches (305 mm) below the trench are {{loosened}} with a <b>spading</b> <b>fork.</b> When the next trench is dug, that soil is dropped into the empty space of the first trench, and the lower layer is again loosened with a <b>spading</b> <b>fork.</b> This process is repeated along the full length of the bed. The final trench is filled with the soil that was removed from the first trench. The result is a bed that has been tilled to a depth of 24 inches (610 mm). When an entire bed has been double dug, the soil will have greater drainage and aeration, which allows the roots to grow much deeper and reach more nutrients. Despite the fact that no soil has been added, the bed is raised due to the aeration. It is worth noting that hard, unworked soil should be double dug each season until the soil has attained good structure and long lasting aeration. During subsequent seasons, it can be surface cultivated 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) deep with a hula hoe until compaction again becomes apparent. After double digging the first season, deep tilling during subsequent seasons can be quickly accomplished with a u-bar, particularly in the cases of larger minifarms or commercial farms.|$|E
5000|$|A garden fork, <b>spading</b> <b>fork,</b> {{digging fork}} or graip is a {{gardening}} implement, with a handle and several (usually four) short, sturdy tines. It {{is used for}} loosening, lifting and turning over soil in gardening and farming. It is used similarly to a spade, but in many circumstances it is more appropriate than a spade: the tines allow the implement to be pushed more easily into the ground, it can rake out stones and weeds and break up clods, {{it is not so}} easily stopped by stones, and it does not cut through weed roots or root-crops. Garden forks were originally made of wood, but the majority are now made of carbon steel or stainless steel.|$|E
5000|$|In the Minas Basin area of Nova Scotia, {{digging for}} soft-shelled clams is usually {{done with a}} clam hack, a <b>spading</b> <b>fork</b> with its short handle bent perpendicularly away from the fork's head. A digger {{typically}} uses the hack by grasping {{the spine of the}} prongs in one hand and the handle of the fork in the other to push the hack down into the mud, clay, or sand and then pull it up and towards him/herself. This digging action opens up the substrate to expose the clams. Those clams legally long enough (44 mm in Nova Scotia) are then taken by hand and put into a peck-size (9 litre) bucket that is used to measure the volume of clams collected.|$|E
