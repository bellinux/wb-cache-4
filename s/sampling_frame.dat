25|$|As a remedy, we seek a <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> {{which has}} the {{property}} that we can identify every single element and include any in our sample. The most straightforward type of frame {{is a list of}} elements of the population (preferably the entire population) with appropriate contact information. For example, in an opinion poll, possible sampling frames include an electoral register and a telephone directory.|$|E
25|$|It {{also means}} that one does not need a <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> listing all {{elements}} in the target population. Instead, clusters can be chosen from a cluster-level frame, with an element-level frame created only for the selected clusters. In the example above, the sample only requires a block-level city map for initial selections, and then a household-level map of the 100 selected blocks, rather than a household-level map of the whole city.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} a JRC {{contribution}} to the FAO Global Strategy to improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics (GSARS). Its aim is providing guidelines on the suitable ways to use satellite images and geographic information tools to build master <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> {{that can be used}} both for agricultural and environmental statistics. The main readers to which the report is addressed are agricultural and environmental statisticians in developing countries. We consider separately the use of technological tools for area <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> and for list <b>sampling</b> <b>frames.</b> The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), better known as GPS, is also discussed, although its use is more connected to carrying out field surveys rather than to the design of <b>sampling</b> <b>frames.</b> JRC.

The {{selected}} cohort {{ratio was}} heavily skewed toward the severely affected area (75%) {{and such a}} selection would have introduced bias in the results and an incomplete understanding of the health effects in the population. The non-random cluster of deaths sample selection approach instead of randomised selection using a <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> had the potential for interviewer bias due to prior knowledge of potential health effects. Persons migrating out were excluded rather than treated as lost to follow-up thereby shrinking the sample size available for analysis.|$|E

30|$|Establishing {{representative}} {{samples for}} Software Engineering surveys {{is still considered}} a challenge.

50|$|While offline content such as {{printed text}} remains static once produced, online content can {{frequently}} change. The dynamic nature of online material {{combined with the}} large and increasing volume of online content can make it challenging to construct a <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> from which to draw a random sample. The content of a site may also differ across users, requiring careful specification of the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame.</b> Some researchers have used search engines to construct sampling frames. This technique has disadvantages because search engine results are unsystematic and non-random making them unreliable for obtaining an unbiased sample. The <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> issue can be circumvented by using an entire population of interest, such as tweets by particular Twitter users or online archived content of certain newspapers as the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame.</b> Changes to online material can make categorizing content (step 3) more challenging. Because online content can change frequently it is particularly important to note the time period over which the sample is collected. A useful step is to archive the sample contehnt {{in order to prevent}} changes from being made.|$|E

However, other issues also come into play such as the accuracy of contact and other information appearing on the file as well as its cost. The American Medical Association Masterfile has long been considered the preferred choice for surveys of physicians, although it does have drawbacks. Here we consider two alternative files, discussing their relative advantages and disadvantages.

The overview will show where possibilities exist to jointly build and share <b>sampling</b> <b>frames</b> and where studies not using an existing population register can profit from the experience of other studies which do have access to such a register in the same country.

Deming observed that in any forecasting activity, the population is that of future events while the <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> is, inevitably, some subset of historical events.

[...] The reasons why a <b>sampling</b> <b>frame</b> does not exist lies in the illegal and stigmatized nature of sex work.
