[...] After they have foiled the ghost's plot and destroyed the ship, Richard finds Susan practising the same music he heard aboard the ship. [...] She tells him it is by Bach. [...] Prof. Chronotis later tells Richard how he managed to retrieve some of the music by introducing it in the Baroque period through the invention of a fake composer.|$|E
2500|$|Stray voltage is {{any case}} of {{undesirable}} elevated electrical potential, but more precise terminology gives {{an indication of}} the source of the [...] voltage. Neutral to earth voltage (NEV) specifically refers to a difference in potential between a locally grounded object and the grounded return conductor, or neutral, of an electrical system. The neutral is theoretically at 0V potential, as any grounded object, but current flows on the neutral back to the source, somewhat elevating the neutral voltage. [...] NEV is the product of current flowing on the neutral and the finite, non-zero impedance of the neutral conductor between a given point and its source, often a distant substation. [...] NEV differs from accidentally energized objects because it is an unavoidable result of normal <b>system</b> <b>operation,</b> not an accident or a fault in materials or design.|$|E
2500|$|The Gazelle was {{the first}} {{helicopter}} to be adapted for single-pilot operations under instrument flight rules. An advanced [...] autopilot system was developed by Honeywell {{in order to allow}} the pilot to not be overworked during solo flights; the Gazelle was chosen as the platform to develop this capability as {{it was one of the}} faster and more stable helicopters in service at that point and had a reputation for being easy to fly. The docile flying abilities of the Gazelle are such that it has been reported as being capable of comfortably flying without its main hydraulic <b>system</b> <b>operation</b> at speeds of up to 100 knots. The flight controls are highly responsive; unusually, the Gazelle lacks a throttle or a trimming system. Hydraulic servo boosters are present on all flight control circuits to mitigate control difficulties in the event of equipment failure.|$|E

2500|$|Severity is {{the impact}} the bug has on <b>system</b> <b>operation.</b> This impact may be data loss, financial, loss of {{goodwill}} and wasted effort. Severity levels are not standardized. Impacts differ across industry. A crash in a video game has a totally different impact than a crash in a web browser, or real time monitoring system. For example, bug severity levels might be [...] "crash or hang", [...] "no workaround" [...] (meaning {{there is no way}} the customer can accomplish a given task), [...] "has workaround" [...] (meaning the user can still accomplish the task), [...] "visual defect" [...] (for example, a missing image or displaced button or form element), or [...] "documentation error". Some software publishers use more qualified severities such as [...] "critical", [...] "high", [...] "low", [...] "blocker" [...] or [...] "trivial". The severity of a bug may be a separate category to its priority for fixing, and the two may be quantified and managed separately.|$|E
