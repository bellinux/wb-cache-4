50|$|It {{highlights}} the waste {{produced in the}} process {{as opposed to the}} reaction, thus helping those who try to fulfil one of the twelve principles of green chemistry to avoid waste production. E-factors ignore recyclable factors such as recycled solvents and re-used catalysts, which obviously increases the accuracy but ignores the energy involved in the recovery (these are often included theoretically by assuming 90% <b>solvent</b> <b>recovery).</b> The main difficulty with E-factors is the need to define system boundaries, for example, which stages of the production or product life-cycle to consider before calculations can be made. Crucially, this metric is simple to apply industrially, as a production facility can measure how much material enters the site and how much leaves as product and waste, thereby directly giving an accurate global E-factor for the site. Table 1 shows that oil companies produce a lot less waste than pharmaceuticals as a percentage of material processed. This reflects the fact that the profit margins in the oil industry require them to minimise waste and find uses for products which would normally be discarded as waste. By contrast the pharmaceutical sector is more focused on molecule manufacture and quality. The (currently) high profit margins within the sector mean that there is less concern about the comparatively large amounts of waste that are produced (especially considering the volumes used) although it has to be noted that, despite the percentage waste and E-factor being high, the pharmaceutical section produces much lower tonnage of waste than any other sector. This table encouraged a number of large pharmaceutical companies to commence “green” chemistry programs.|$|E

Although the selectivity remains unaltered, upon recycling of the linker-less polymer-supported catalysts, extended reaction times are required to maintain high yields of the desired carbonyl compounds. Alternatively, attachment of two nitroxyl radicals onto each functionalized PEG chain terminus via a 5 -hydroxyisophthalic acid linker affords branched polymer-supported catalysts. In stark contrast to the linker-less catalysts, these branched nitroxyls exhibit catalytic activities up to five times greater than 4 -methoxy-TEMPO alone under similar conditions. In addition, minimal decrease in catalytic activity is observed upon recycling of these branched macromolecular catalysts via solvent-induced precipitation. The high catalytic activities and preservation of activity upon recycling of these branched systems is attributed to enhanced regeneration of the nitroxyl species as a result of intramolecular syn-proportionation...|$|R

In-line toxic product removal during solvent production by continuous fermentation using immobilized clostridium acetobutylicum. Enzyme and Microbial Technology, 9 (11), 672 - 675. The use of whey permeate as the fermentation substrate {{for the production}} of acetone:butanol:ethanol (solvents), using C. acetobutylicum P 262 was studied. Initial experiments were conducted in a batch mode using sulphuric acid casein whey permeate medium, in an attempt to optimize the culture conditions for maximal extent of lactose utilization and solvents production. A high initial lactose concentration (65 - 75 g/l) in combination with a culture pH maintained in the region pH 5. 4 to 5. 6 were the most favourable conditions for solvent production. An inverse relationship between the lactose utilization rate and solvents yield was observed. Solvent productivities were only 60 % however, of that achievable with this strain of organism on an industrial scale using a molasses medium, but comparable productivities were obtained using a semi-synthetic medium containing glucose. Hydrolysed-lactose sulphuric acid casein whey permeate medium was investigated as a medium for solvent production. Glucose and galactose were utilized simultaneously, although glucose was used preferentially. Only a small increase in solvents productivity was obtained compared with that obtained using non-hydrolysed permeate. Experiments were performed in continuous culture using cheese whey permeate medium and alginate-immobilized cells. Significantly greater solvent productivities were obtained, compared with those achieved using free cells in batch culture. Fermentations were operated for over 650 hours with no detectable loss in fermentation performance. The extent of lactose utilization was low, however (less than 40 %), and attempts to increase this by the use of pH regulation or a two-stage process were unsuccessful. This fermentation process was described as a biomass volume process (volumetric fraction of alginate beads in the reactor), where the lactose utilization and hence the solvents production, was defined by an inhibitory concentration of butanol, approximately 5 g/l. An alternative continuous fermentation process using free cells and cheese whey permeate medium was investigated. External cell recycle using cross-flow microfiltration (CFM) membrane plant to continuously separate cells from the fermentation culture and recycle them back to the fermenter was utilized. Biomass was continuously removed from the fermenter in order to achieve a stable biomass concentration. Stable solvents production was not achieved under the range of culture conditions investigated; culture degeneration was attributed to the complex interactive morphological cyclic behaviour of the organism. A tubular CFM unit which could be periodically backflushed to maintain the filtrate flux, was found to be the most suitable of those tested. The integration of in-situ or in-line <b>solvents</b> <b>recovery</b> with batch culture using free cells, and continuous fermentation using cells immobilized by adsorption to bonechar, was investigated in order to remove toxic solvents and so increase the extent of lactose utilization and solvents productivity. A novel process using gas-stripping with an inert gas, and <b>solvents</b> <b>recovery</b> from the vapour phase by condensation using a cold trap, was described. An increase in lactose utilization and solvents productivity was achieved in both fermentation modes compared with control fermentations. The use of adsorbent resins and a molecular sieve for integrated fermentation <b>solvents</b> <b>recovery</b> was also demonstrated. However, the adsorption of medium components may mitigate against the usefulness of such a process option. The batch refermentation of batch fermentation effluent treated by gas-stripping to remove solvents was investigated. However, solvent production was favoured only when lactose and nutrients were supplemented to concentrations similar to those present originally. Conversely, fermentation medium treated by gas-stripping to remove solvents could be readily refermented to produce solvents when an existing cell population was used, suggesting that this option of an integrated continuous fermentation-product recovery process may be promising for whey permeate solvent production...|$|R
