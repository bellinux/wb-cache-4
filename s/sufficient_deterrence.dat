2500|$|The Singapore Court of Appeal {{endorsed}} the reasoning in Boyce v. Paddington Borough Council (1902) which explained the applicable test for standing regarding public rights. Since public rights {{are shared by}} everyone in common because they arise from public duties owed by public authorities to the general class of persons as a whole, an applicant must prove [...] "special damage" [...] peculiar to himself or herself to distinguish his or her claim from those of other potential litigants in the same class. The Court justified the need for special damage in cases involving public rights to prevent frivolous or vexatious actions. Otherwise, courts will be swamped by an array of actions raised by [...] "mere busybodies and social gadflies, {{to the detriment of}} good public administration" [...] where the burden of bearing costs may not be a <b>sufficient</b> <b>deterrence.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{consumer}} groups {{argue that the}} FDCPA does not go far enough, and does not provide <b>sufficient</b> <b>deterrence</b> against unscrupulous collection agencies. Consumer groups have complained that the maximum statutory damages contained in the original 1977 version of the law has not kept up with inflation; $1,000 in 1977 dollars is worth $ today.|$|E

40|$|A simple rugged {{acoustic}} stall sensor {{which has}} an output proportional to angle of attack near wing stall has been evaluated on a Cessna 319 aircraft. A sensor position has been found on the wing where the sensor output is only slightly affected by engine power level, yaw angle, flap position and wing roughness. The NASA LRC General Aviation Simulator {{has been used to}} evaluate the acoustic sensor output as a control signal for active stall deterrent systems. It has been found that a simple control algorithm is <b>sufficient</b> for stall <b>deterrence...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{offender}} {{was attending}} a house party where he assaulted an 18-year-old girl {{while she was}} sleeping. The offender was convicted. At the sentencing hearing {{he asked for a}} conditional sentence, citing s 718.2(3) of the Criminal Code, which directs that sentencing courts should take the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders into account when considering whether to give a non-custodial sentence. The trial judge agreed that the court must take into account the offender's Aboriginal heritage, but held that the sentence could not be served in the community since it would not provide <b>sufficient</b> denunciation and <b>deterrence.</b> The Alberta Court of Appeal upheld the sentence.|$|R
40|$|Stall {{deterrent}} concepts {{for general}} aviation aircraft {{have been investigated}} using simulation studies and flight test experiments. It {{was found that the}} simulator was suitable for the development of deterrent system concepts, but the simulator was unacceptable for pilot evaluation of system effectiveness under typical stall/spin accident conditions. A Cessna 319 was outfitted with sensors, servoactuators, and analog control logic necessary to investigate a wide range of stall deterrent systems. It was found that an acoustic stall sensor and an error control law were <b>sufficient</b> for stall <b>deterrence.</b> The pitch intervention control system prevented aircraft stall for all aircraft configurations and pilot inputs. The variable up elevator stop concept was found to be effective for slow decelerations to aircraft stall. The stall deterrent systems were evaluated by four professional pilots and three low time pilots...|$|R
40|$|North Korea has {{recently}} announced that it has developed nuclear weapons and has {{pulled out of the}} six-party talks. These events do not emerge out of a vacuum, and this article lends perspective based on an interdisciplinary lens that seeks to grapple with the complexities and provide constructive approaches based on this well-researched understanding. This article analyzes political, military, historical, legal and other angles of this international crisis. Past dealings with North Korea have been unfruitful because other nations do not recognize the ties between North Korean acts and its ideology and objectives. For a satisfactory resolution to the current crisis, South Korea and the U. S. must maintain <b>sufficient</b> <b>deterrence,</b> focus on multi-lateral and international avenues, and increase the negative and later positive incentives for North Korean compliance with its international obligations. From an international legal and international organizations perspective, the multilateral talks can be bolstered by inclusion of the United Nations Secretary General as a proactive mediator. It can call for, if necessary and after the failure of other means, UN Security Council action and the reinstitution of the IAEA to do its duly constituted work of preventing proliferation. If these approaches succeed, the peninsula, region and world will become better places as a result...|$|E
40|$|The civil {{consequences}} {{of corruption in}} international commercial contracts are poorly mapped under English private law, despite the economic importance of English law in governing international contracts. England seeks to balance protecting the main economic transaction (eg the main infrastructure project, the main provision of goods) benefitting the principal (eg a foreign public authority) with harsh treatment of the corrupting transaction itself, ie the transaction between the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker. The starting point in English law for addressing corruption {{is the relationship between}} the principal and its agent. Even though the Bribery Act 2010 moved away from this principal/agent relationship to address corruption from a criminal law perspective, the UK Supreme Court relied on this principal/agent relationship in FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC, where it held that the agent held the product of corruption in trust for his principal. The question remains whether such financial adjustments developed by the judges are a <b>sufficient</b> punishment or <b>deterrence</b> against corruption. They may offer a clear and simple answer signalling clearly that English judges disapprove of corruption as a serious evil. However, as a matter of public policy, a range of other techniques may need to be developed to discourage corruption in a more systematic way among all the parties involved, the bribe-giver included...|$|R
