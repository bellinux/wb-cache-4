More recently, fusion protein (FP) consisting of L-methionase linked to annexin-V has been used in cancer therapy.

One efficient yeast isolate capable of decolorizing both mono-azo dyes and di-azo dyes was selected, immobilized by entrapment method and studied for decolorization efficiency. The isolate was morphologically, culturally and biochemically identified as Saccharomyces sp. Sodium alginate entrapped yeast cells were studied for decolorization of commercially available textile dyes having azo groups. The extent of colour removal in the culture medium was assessed through the decrease in dye absorbance of the supernatants. The immobilized yeast’s decolorization abilities were different and varied with inoculum size, incubation time and nutrients like carbon and nitrogen sources. The fermentation conditions like pH, temperature and aeration had no profound effect. The decolorization ranged from 70 - 100 %. Complete decolorization was seen within 12 and 18 hrs depending on inoculum size. The immobilized beads with yeasts could be reused efficiently for three cycles.

The ability of WDXRF spectroscopic technique to predict the levels of adulteration of paprika and sweet pepper suspected to be adulterated with Sudan I-IV, Para Red and Sunset Yellow FCF dyes was investigated in this study. Logistic regression and discriminant analysis classification models were developed to predict the type of adulteration using WDXRF spectral features such as the Compton and Rayleigh scatter intensities and the Compton and Rayleigh ratios. Prediction of the levels of adulteration was assessed by using multiple regression analysis. 83 % of the 210 adulterated samples were correctly classified by the logistic regression with 90 % sensitivity, 75 %specificity with a prediction power of 92 % into respective adulteration groups. 86 % and 90 % correct prediction were obtained for discriminant analysis models with 94 % sensitivity and 74 % specificity.

A benchmark evaluation on different time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) approaches with respect to high-level correlated coupled cluster (CC) and multireference perturbation theory (MRPT) benchmark calculations is performed in the gas phase. The benchmark results indicate that TDDFT calculations using the hybrid MPW 1 K and the long-range correct CAM-B 3 LYP functionals represent a valuable tool of comparable accuracy {{to that of the}} much more computationally demanding ab initio methods.

The two dyes, Reactive Orange 16 (RO 16) and Reactive Green 19 (RG 19) {{are classified as}} Category 2 A (irritating to eyes) based on the UN Globally Harmonized System for classification (UN GHS), according to the Draize test. On the other hand, animal welfare considerations and the enforcement of a new regulation in the EU are drawing much attention in reducing or replacing animal experiments with alternative methods. This study evaluated the eye irritation of the two dyes RO 16 and RG 19 by combining the Short Time Exposure (STE) and the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability (BCOP) assays and then comparing them with in vivo data from the GHS classification. The STE test (first level <b>screening)</b> categorized both <b>dyes</b> as GHS Category 1 (severe irritant).

40|$|We {{have applied}} {{multiple}} site optical recording of transmembrane voltage (MSORTV) to patterned growth cultures of heart cells {{to analyze the}} effect of geometry per se on impulse propagation in excitable tissue, with cellular and subcellular resolution. Extensive <b>dye</b> <b>screening</b> led to the choice of di- 8 -ANEPPS as the most suitable voltage-sensitive dye for this application; it is internalized slowly and permits optical recording with signal-to-noise ratios as high as 40 : 1 (measured peak-to-peak) and average fractional fluorescence changes of 15 % per 100 mV. Using a x 100 objective and a fast data acquisition system, we could resolve impulse propagation on a microscopic scale (15 microns) with high temporal resolution (uncertainty of +/- 5 microseconds). We could observe the decrease in conduction velocity of an impulse propagating along a narrow cell strand as it enters a region of abrupt expansion, and we could explain this phenomenon {{in terms of the}} micro-architecture of the tissue. In contrast with the elongated and aligned cells forming the narrow strands, the cells forming the expansions were aligned at random and presented 2. 5 times as many cell-to-cell appositions per unit length. If the decrease in conduction velocity results entirely from this increased number of cell-to-cell boundaries per unit length, the mean activation delay introduced by each boundary can be estimated to be 70 microseconds.

40|$|Metabolomics is a post genomic {{field of}} {{research}} concerned with the study of low molecular weight compounds within a biological system permitting {{the investigation of the}} metabolite differences between natural and perturbed systems (such as cells, organs and tissues). Rapid identification and discrimination of biological samples based upon metabolic differences and physiological status in microbiology, mammalian systems (particularly for disease diagnosis), plants and food science is highly desirable. Volatile organic compound (VOC) profiling is a novel area of research where the composition of the VOCs emitted by the biological samples can be correlated to its origin and physiological status. The aim of this project was to investigate the applicability of VOC profiling as a potential complementary tool within metabolomics. In this project the discrimination of bacteria using a novel gas phase separation method was investigated and the development of VOC-based profiling tools for the collections of VOCs emitted from biological samples was also studied. The optimisation and validation of a high throughput method for VOC analysis was achieved and this was used to assess wound healing. VOC metabolite profiling was further extended to the discrimination of S. typhimurium contaminated meat; the study was conducted in parallel with metabolite profiling analysis for the analysis of non-volatile small molecules. Finally, enhanced vibrational spectroscopic techniques were applied to the characterisation and <b>screening</b> of <b>dye</b> molecules in contaminated foodstuffs using Raman spectroscopy. This thesis clearly demonstrates that VOC metabolic profiling is a complementary tool within the metabolomics toolbox, one of its great attractions is that it permits the characterisation of biological samples in a rapid and non-invasive manner. The technique provides detailed chemical information regarding the VOC composition present above the headspace of the sample and can be used to understand its physiological status and biological origin. VOCs metabolite profiling will become a valuable tool for non-invasive analysis of many biological systems. Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive and non-destructive technique which can generate detailed chemical and structural information regarding the analyte under investigation with little or no sample preparation needed. The effect of the weak Raman signal can be significantly amplified by coupling the analyte molecule to surfaces of nanoparticles and demonstrated that it is ideal for analysing aqueous dye solutions in a quantitative manner.

In order to discover new photoactive drugs or characterize phototoxic pollutants, it would be advantageous to use simple biological tests of phototoxicy. In this work, we present a pilot <b>screening</b> of 37 <b>dyes</b> to test for phototoxic effects in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Populations of this nematode were treated with different dyes, and subsequently exposed to 30 min of white light. Behavioral outcomes were quantified by recording the global motility using an infrared tracking device (WMicrotracker). Of the tested compounds, 17 dyes were classified as photoactive, being phloxine B, primuline, eosin Y, acridine orange and rose Bengal the most phototoxic. To assess photoactivity after uptake, compounds were retested after washing {{them out of the}} medium before light irradiation. Dye uptake into the worms was also analyzed by staining or fluorescence. All the positive drugs were incorporated by animals and produced phototoxic effects after washing. We also tested the stress response being triggered by the treatments through reporter strains. Endoplasmic reticulum stress response (hsp- 4 ::GFP strain) was activated by 22 % of phototoxic dyes, and mitochondrial stress response (hsp- 6 ::GFP strain) was induced by 16 % of phototoxic dyes.

40|$|Given the {{appropriate}} multicell electrophysiological techniques, small networks of cultured neurons (microcultures) are {{well suited to}} long-term studies of synaptic plasticity. To this end, we have developed an apparatus for optical recording from cultured vertebrate neurons using voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes (Chien, C. -B., and J. Pine. 1991. J. Neurosci. Methods. 38 : 93 - 105). We evaluate here the usefulness of this technique for recording action potentials and synaptic potentials in microcultures of neurons from the rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG). After extensive <b>dye</b> <b>screening</b> and optimization of conditions, we chose the styryl dye RH 423, which gave fast linear fluorescence changes of approximately 1 %/ 100 mV for typical recordings. The root mean square noise of the apparatus (limited by shot noise) was typically 0. 03 %, equivalent to 3 mV of membrane potential. Illumination for at least 100 flashes of 100 ms each caused no noticeable photodynamic damage. Our results show that voltage-sensitive dyes {{can be used to}} record from microcultures of vertebrate neurons with high sensitivity. Dye signals were detected from both cell bodies and neurites. Signals from presumptive dendrites showed hyperpolarizations and action potentials simultaneous with those in the cell body, while those from presumptive axons showed delayed propagating action potentials. Subthreshold synaptic potentials in the cell body were occasionally detectable optically; however, they were usually masked by signals from axons passing through the same pixel. This is due to the complex anatomy of SCG microcultures, which have many crisscrossing neurites that often pass over cell bodies. Given a simpler microculture system with fewer neurites, {{it should be possible to}} use dye recording to routinely measure subthreshold synaptic strengths...|$|R

It is therefore important to use a reference test to confirm borderline results. In this study, we evaluated the use of a new qualitative test based on Western blot analysis—the LDBio-Toxo II IgG test—as a confirmatory test for at-risk patients. The study was performed retrospectively, using 569 serum samples with “low-positive” (2 to 32 international units) anti-Toxoplasma IgG levels from 375 patients. These samples were either sera collected during the routine screening of pregnant women, from patients with unrelated infections, or from immunocompromised patients or sequential sera taken from pregnant women with acquired Toxoplasma infection or from their newborns during follow-up. The LDBio-Toxo II IgG test was compared to several commercial tests {{commonly used}} for anti-Toxoplasma IgG <b>screening.</b> The Sabin-Feldman <b>dye</b> test was used as a reference test.

While their early compounds were too toxic, Ehrlich and Sahachiro Hata, a Japanese bacteriologist working with Erlich in the quest for a drug to treat syphilis, achieved success with the 606th compound in their series of experiments. In 1910 Ehrlich and Hata announced their discovery, which they called drug [...] "606", at the Congress for Internal Medicine at Wiesbaden. The Hoechst company began to market the compound toward the end of 1910 under the name Salvarsan. This drug is now known as arsphenamine. The drug was used to treat syphilis in the first half of the 20th century. In 1908, Ehrlich received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions to immunology. Hata was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911 and for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1912 and 1913.|$|R
40|$|Speckle {{noise is}} an {{integral}} part of any laser projection display because it is the nature of laser (coherent) illumination to form interference patterns with high visibility. The granularity of the image due to the speckle formed on the viewer's retina degrades the image quality, thus stimulating the need for speckle reduction techniques applied to laser displays. An instrument to measure image plane speckle contrast was built based on a linear CCD detector array interfaced to an LSI- 11 microcomputer. Speckle reduction techniques were then evaluated by comparing the contrast obtained with each method. The effect of the spatial frequency response (MTF) on the measured contrast was studied, along with the statistical significance of the measurement which is limited by the finite sample space of 1024 detector pixels per CCD frame. The lowering of the contrast due to the array MTF can be minimized by working at extremely high F numbers (> 100). The sample space can be widened by taking more than one frame of data and treating all the frames as a single data set. Techniques to reduce speckle noise in laser displays fall into two broad categories: reducing the coherence of light forming the speckle, and incoherently adding multiple uncorrelated (or partially correlated) speckle patterns. The first technique (effective only for monochromatic displays) was implemented by coating a <b>screen</b> with various <b>dyes,</b> phosphors, or fluorescent paints. Using the 514 nm line from an Argon laser, the contrast can be reduced by almost 30 % by spraying a thin layer of fluorescent paint on the screen. More speckle reduction can be achieved with an accompanying loss in image brightness. The second technique involved creating a multiplicity of partially correlated speckle patterns that appear from the same position on the screen over the integration period of the eye. The different speckle patterns are produced by changing the angle of illumination while keeping a portion of the laser spot focused on the same point on the screen. The scan angle method (applicable to multi-color displays), can be implemented by properly synchronizing an acousto-optic modulator with the scan optics, and imaging the modulator on the screen. Using a beaded screen and a reasonable laser dither of 10 millirads, the contrast can be reduced by half...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} (PK) of the photosensitizer tetra(m-hydroxyphenyl) chlorin (mTHPC) {{was measured}} by optical fiber-based light-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS) in the normal and tumoral cheek pouch mucosa of 29 Golden Syrian hamsters with chemically induced squamous cell carcinoma. Similar measurements were carried out on the normal oral cavity mucosa of five patients up to 30 days after injection. The drug doses were between 0. 15 and 0. 3 mg per kg of body weight (mg/kg), and the mTHPC fluorescence in the tissue was excited at 420 nm. The PK in both human and hamster exhibited similar behavior although the PK in the hamster mucosa was slightly delayed in comparison with that of its human counterpart. The mTHPC fluorescence signal of the hamster mucosa was smaller {{than that of the}} human mucosa by a factor of about 3 for the same injected drug dose. A linear correlation was found between the fluorescence signal and the mTHPC dose in the range from 0. 075 to 0. 5 mg/kg at times between 8 and 96 h after injection. No significant selectivity in mTHPC fluorescence between the tumoral and normal mucosa of the hamsters was found at any of the applied conditions. The sensitivity of the normal and tumoral hamster cheek pouch mucosa to mTHPC photodynamic therapy {{as a function of the}} light dose was determined by light irradiation at 650 nm and 150 mW/cm 2, 4 days after the injection of a drug dose of 0. 15 mg/kg. These results were compared with irradiations of the normal oral and normal and tumoral bronchial mucosa of 37 patients under the same conditions. The reaction to PDT of both types of human mucosae was considerably stronger than that of the hamster cheek pouch mucosa. The sensitivity to PDT became comparable between hamster and human mucosa when the drug dose for the hamster was increased to 0. 5 mg/kg. A significant therapeutic selectivity between the normal and neoplastic hamster cheek pouch was observed. Less selectivity was found following irradiations of normal mucosa and early carcinomas in the human bronchi. The pharmacodynamic behavior of mTHPC was determined by test irradiations of the normal mucosa of hamsters and patients between 6 h and 8 days after injection of 0. 5 and 0. 15 mg/kg in the hamsters and the patients, respectively. The normal hamster cheek pouch showed a maximum response to irradiation 6 h after injection and then decreased continuously to no observable reaction at 8 days after injection. The reaction of the normal human oral mucosa, however, showed an increasing sensitivity to the applied light between 6 h and 4 days after mTHPC injection and then decreased again at 8 days. The hamster model with the chemically induced early squamous cell cancer in the cheek pouch thus showed some similarity to the early squamous cell cancer of the human oral mucosa considering the PK. However, a quantitative difference in fluorescence signal for identical mTHPC doses as well as a significant difference in pharmacodynamic behavior were also observed. The suitability of this animal model for the optimization of PDT parameters in the clinic is therefore limited. Hence great care must be taken in <b>screening</b> new <b>dyes</b> for PDT of early squamous cell cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract based upon observables in the hamster cheek pouch model...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The {{performance}} of {{dye-sensitized solar cells}} (DSC) {{as reported in the}} literature varies even when the materials and/or methods cited are essentially the same. DSC performance even varies significantly within a single lab from researcher to researcher, as has been observed in our lab. To better constrain the sources of the variability and determine which materials and techniques yielded the best DSC performance, various materials and techniques for fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells were evaluated for their effect on DSC performance. Materials investigated included two types of TiO 2 nanoparticles (Aeroxide ® P 25 and a nanoparticle synthesized in our lab) as well as two different electrolytes (Dyesol's High Performance Electrolyte and an electrolyte synthesized in our lab). Results in the literature suggest that nanoparticle dispersion during screen printing paste fabrication is important for the dye loading and optical properties of DSCs, so dispersion techniques including mortar grinding, sonication, roller milling, and ball milling were investigated. DSC fabrication and assembly techniques were also suspected to be important. Comparisons were made between doctor bladed and <b>screen</b> printed films, <b>dye</b> loading of the TiO 2 films under ambient pressures and vacuum, and various sealed and unsealed cell testing configurations. Results from the material and assembly technique comparisons showed varying degrees of impact on DSC film quality and performance. Ball milling was found to be an effective method of disaggregating P 25 TiO 2 nanoparticles for screen printing pastes, whereas mortar grinding left large TiO 2 clusters and yielded variable cluster size distributions from batch to batch. The presence of TiO 2 clusters increased film cracking, film peeling, and light scattering and consequently reduced DSC performance. Vacuum-assisted dye loading was not found to improve DSC performance. A comparison of gasket-sealed, epoxy-sealed, and unsealed DSCs did not show consistent differences in performance, though unsealed cells showed poor stability over short time periods. Both screen printing and doctor blading of TiO 2 films yielded films of uniform thickness and DSCs of comparable performance. Finally, a lab electrolyte was found to yield DSCs with a higher short circuit current compared to DSCs that used Dyesol's High Performance Electrolyte. The electrolyte performance difference is partially due to higher charge transfer resistance at the TiO 2 -electrolyte interface...|$|R
40|$|The Polaroid Corporation, in May of 1983, {{introduced}} Polachrome CS color transparency {{film and}} a new process called the Autoprocess system. This system offers the convenience of obtaining instant color transparencies in about three minutes. The film has excellent projection and viewing characteristics. The product was designed to have its largest market with professional photographers. Polachrome 2 ̆ 7 s construction creates problems for the printer in that moire patterns occur during the separation process. This study gives a short background for both additive color <b>screen</b> films and <b>dye</b> layer films, and a comparison is made to help the reader understand the problems with scanning Polachrome film. When attempting to scan Polachorme CS film, moire patterns are produced {{because of the color}} filters which make up the film. The emphasis {{of this study was to}} determine which scanner controls could be used to remove the moire patterns. Polachrome CS film is based on the principle of an additive color screen theory. The film contains many layers, one layer consisting of red, green, and blue filters which either passes or stops light. When this filter layer is viewed by the scanning lens an interference pattern called moire is produced by the variables of screen ruling, unsharp masking controls, and the angle of the transparency on the scanning drum. The hypothesis states that Polachrome CS color transparency film can be scanned on the DC- 300 B/L laser scanner, so that separations are free of all moire patterns with acceptable definition. Pre-testing was necessary to determine which variables of the scanning process had an effect on producing a moire pattern. The results of the pre-tests determined the final choice of variables, which were then tested together. Defocusing, unsharp masking (intensity and starting point), as well as the angle at which the transparency is mounted, were determined to be the major variables that cause a moire pattern when scanning Polachrome CS transparency film. From the combination of these variables a total of 48 proofs were generated for the visual experiment. The visual experiment had two parts, involving 30 viewers, viewing the 48 proofs. Part I dealt with a question relating to moire patterns and Part II dealt with a question relating to the definition of the image. Data was recorded and analyzed. The hypothesis, that separations can be generated free of moire patterns with acceptable definition, was proven by 16 percent of the proofs tested. This resulted in a set of recommendations given as guidelines to follow when Polachrome transparency film is electronically scanned on the DC- 300 B/L laser scanner...|$|R
