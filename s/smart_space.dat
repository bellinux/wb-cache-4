Central to building <b>smart</b> <b>spaces</b> is the support for sophisticated coordination among diverse smart things collaborating to accomplish specified tasks. Multi-agent systems are often used as the software infrastructures to address the coordination in <b>smart</b> <b>spaces.</b> However, since agents in <b>smart</b> <b>spaces</b> are dynamic, resource-bounded and have complicated service dependencies, current approaches to coordination in multi-agent systems encounter new challenges when applied in <b>smart</b> <b>spaces.</b> In this paper, we present Baton, a service management system to explicitly resolve the particular issues stemming from <b>smart</b> <b>spaces</b> while coordinating agents (delegating smart things in <b>smart</b> <b>spaces).</b> Baton is designed as a complement to coordination approaches in multi-agent systems {{with a focus on}} mechanisms for service discovery, service composition, request arbitration and dependency maintenance.
