500|$|The Wisconsin Supreme Court placed special {{emphasis}} on the phrase [...] "all statutes of the United States which affect Indians because of their status as Indians shall no longer be applicable {{to the members of}} the tribe, and the laws of the several States <b>shall</b> <b>apply</b> to the tribe and its members in the same manner as they apply to other citizens or persons within their jurisdiction." [...] The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the latter section was controlling, despite the tribal members' argument that hunting rights were retained by treaty rather than by statute. The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the tribe had lost their hunting and fishing rights. The tribal members appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the appeal.|$|E

2500|$|The name Afghānistān (...) is {{believed}} to be as old as the ethnonym Afghan, which is documented in the 10th-century geography book Hudud ul-'alam. The root name [...] "Afghan" [...] was used historically in reference to a member of the ethnic Pashtuns, and the suffix [...] "-stan" [...] means [...] "place of" [...] in Persian and Hindi. Therefore, Afghanistan translates to land of the Afghans or, more specifically in a historical sense, to land of the Pashtuns. However, the modern Constitution of Afghanistan states that [...] "he word Afghan <b>shall</b> <b>apply</b> to every citizen of Afghanistan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{distinct}} water masses converge in {{the immediate}} vicinity of the APF or Antarctic Convergence (in particular the Subantarctic Surface Water (Subantarctic Mode Water or SAMW), Antarctic Surface Water, and the Antarctic Intermediate Water). This convergence creates a unique environment, noted for its very high marine productivity, especially for Antarctic krill. Because of this, all lands and waters situated south of the Antarctic Convergence are considered to belong to the Antarctic from a climatological, biological and hydrological standpoint. However, the text of the Antarctic Treaty, article VI ("Area covered by Treaty") states: [...] "The provisions of the present Treaty <b>shall</b> <b>apply</b> to the area south of 60° South latitude". Therefore, Antarctica is defined from a political standpoint as all land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude.|$|E

In presenting the reform package, the German Social Democrat MEP Ulrike Rodust stated: [...] "As of 2015 the principle of [...] maximum sustainable yield <b>shall</b> <b>apply</b> ... Our objective is that depleted fish stocks recover by 2020. Not only nature will benefit, but also fishermen: bigger stocks produce higher yields." [...] The 2013 reform led to a greater role for the European Parliament, involving the convening of a trilateral dialogue (or [...] "trilogue") between the European Council, European Commission and the Parliament, to work towards general agreement on reforming the CFP.|$|E

2500|$|Although the California Cannabis Coalition {{decision}} was narrow, {{it has been}} heavily criticized because {{in an effort to}} grant deference to the local initiative power, “the court erred in the opposite direction by adopting an overly narrow reading of Proposition 218.” [...] Another article noted: [...] "The court's decision represents a ridiculously narrow vision of what was intended by Proposition 218." [...] Proposition 218 constitutionally requires that its provisions be “liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.” [...] The California Supreme Court has also previously stated that the constitutional provisions of Proposition 218 are of dignity at least equal to other provisions of the California Constitution. In addition, Proposition 218 also makes it expressly clear with prefacing language that its constitutional requirements applicable to taxes <b>shall</b> <b>apply</b> “otwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution.” [...] The local initiative power is provided for in an “other provision of this Constitution.” [...] None of the foregoing were referenced in the majority opinion in the California Cannabis Coalition case.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the Court of Appeal's {{approach}} to constitutional interpretation in the case reflects the approach taken by the Privy Council in Minister for Home Affairs v. Fisher (1979). Such an approach deems a constitutional instrument as sui generis and calling for principles of interpretation of its own because full recognition and effect {{must be given to}} fundamental rights and freedoms. The Court of Appeal's focus on the suggestion that residents have an entitlement or right to representation rather than on the purpose behind the statute has been described as embracing the Fisher approach and as a departure from the interpretive approach to constitutional interpretation espoused in section 9A of the Interpretation Act read with Article 2(9) of the Constitution. Section 9A requires a purposive approach to be taken when interpreting laws, and states that an interpretation of a law that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object. Article 2(9) states: [...] "Subject to this Article, the Interpretation Act (Cap. 1) <b>shall</b> <b>apply</b> for the purpose of interpreting this Constitution and otherwise in relation thereto as it applies for the purpose of interpreting and otherwise in relation to any written law within the meaning of that Act".|$|E

2500|$|In the 1940s and 1960s the Supreme Court {{gradually}} {{issued a}} series of decisions incorporating several of the specific rights from the Bill of Rights, {{so as to be}} binding upon the States. A dissenting school of thought championed by Justice Hugo Black supported that incorporation of specific rights, but urged incorporation of all specific rights instead of just some of them. Black was for so-called mechanical incorporation, or total incorporation, of Amendments 1 through 8 of the Bill of Rights (Amendments 9 and 10 being patently connected to the powers of the state governments). Black felt that the Fourteenth Amendment required the States to respect all of the enumerated rights set forth in the first eight amendments, but he did not wish to see the doctrine expanded to include other, unenumerated [...] "fundamental rights" [...] that might be based on the Ninth Amendment. Black felt that his formulation eliminated any arbitrariness or caprice in deciding what the Fourteenth Amendment ought to protect, by sticking to words already found in the Constitution. Although Black was willing to invalidate federal statutes on federalism grounds, he was not inclined to read any of the first eight amendments as states' rights provisions as opposed to individual rights provisions. Justice Black felt that the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to apply the first eight amendments from the Bill of Rights to the states, as he expressed in his dissenting opinion in Adamson v. California. This view was again expressed by Black in his concurrence in Duncan v. Louisiana citing the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause: [...] "'No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States' seem to me an eminently reasonable way of expressing the idea that henceforth the Bill of Rights <b>shall</b> <b>apply</b> to the States." ...|$|E
