25|$|I have an {{obsession}} with death and sex. Those two things are also the nexus of horror films, which I've been obsessing over lately. I’ve been watching horror movies and 1950s science fiction movies. My re-release is called The Fame Monster so I've just been sort of bulimically eating and regurgitating monster movies and all things scary. I've just been noticing a resurgence of this idea of monster, of fantasy, but {{in a very real}} way. If you notice in those films, there’s always a juxtaposition of sex with death. That's what makes it <b>so</b> <b>scary.</b> Body and mind are primed for orgasm and instead somebody gets killed. That's the sort of sick, twisted psychological circumstance.|$|E
500|$|Producer Oren Koules told horror news website ShockTilYouDrop.com {{that there}} are eleven traps in the film, the most ever in the franchise. [...] There is one [...] "trap" [...] scene in the film that {{producers}} would not allow in previous Saw films that they described as [...] "too violent", [...] "too disgusting", and [...] "just wrong". [...] Melton later confirmed that was the [...] "Garage Trap", which involved a car and sets off a [...] "chain reaction" [...] with other characters. Gabby West {{was part of the}} trap. She told VH1, [...] "They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button. They put layers and layers of different materials on you and you have two straws in your nose so you can breathe. It was <b>so</b> <b>scary!</b> They put so much of it on, you can't see and they put it in your ears so you can barely hear anything. That was part of the prep for the film, which was really cool, to have a dummy made of yourself. But scary." [...] Over 25 gallons of fake blood was used in the film, which was two and half times more than Saw II.|$|E

5000|$|Madrigal {{worked for}} 10 {{years in a}} human {{resources}} staffing agency run by his family, where one of his main responsibilities was firing people. He often worked humor into the job. For example, he once called a man into his own office and spun around in the man’s chair to greet him. He credits his experiences at the staffing company with preparing him for stand-up comedy: [...] "I was in <b>so</b> many <b>scary</b> situations ... by the time I got on stage, I had no stage fright. Speaking {{in front of a}} group was nothing." [...] In 1998, he decided to pursue a full-time career in comedy.|$|R

Morgan says of {{recording}} the song with producer Richard Landis, [...] "Richard purposely slowed the record down to make the musical passages through there really feel kind of spooky and eerie. Everything just felt <b>so</b> swampy and <b>scary.</b> Everybody has their own interpretation of that song and just what they threw off of the Tallahatchie Bridge." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{success of}} Resident Evil in 1996 was {{responsible}} for its template being {{used as the basis}} for a wave of successful survival horror games, many of which were referred to as [...] "Resident Evil clones." [...] The golden age of survival horror started by Resident Evil reached its peak {{around the turn of the}} millennium with Silent Hill, followed by a general decline a few years later. Among the Resident Evil clones at the time, there were several survival horror titles that stood out, such as Clock Tower (1996) and [...] (1998) for the PlayStation. These Clock Tower games proved to be hits, capitalizing on the success of Resident Evil while staying true to the graphic-adventure gameplay of the original Clock Tower rather than following the Resident Evil formula. Another survival horror title that differentiated itself was Corpse Party (1996), an indie, psychological horror adventure game created using the RPG Maker engine. Much like Clock Tower and later Haunting Ground (2005), the player characters in Corpse Party lack any means of defending themselves; the game also featured up to 20 possible endings. However, the game would not be released in Western markets until 2011. Another game similar to the Clock Tower series of games and Haunting Ground, which was also inspired by Resident Evils success is the Korean game known as [...] (2001), this game was reportedly <b>so</b> <b>scary</b> that the developers had to release several patches adding multiple difficulty options, the game was slated for localization in 2004 but was cancelled, building on its previous success in Korea and interest, a remake has been developed in 2015. Riverhillsoft's Overblood, released in 1996, is considered one of the first survival horror games to make use of a fully three-dimensional virtual environment, second only to Riverhillsoft's own Doctor Hauzer in 1994. The Note in 1997 and Hellnight in 1998 experimented with using a real-time 3D first-person perspective rather than pre-rendered backgrounds like Resident Evil.|$|E
500|$|Rob Salem of Toronto Star {{said that}} [...] "fans {{who have been}} {{complaining}} about this season’s relative complacency [...] finally got their gore and more when the farm was overrun by suddenly, strangely single-minded walkers." [...] Pamela Mitchell of Houston Chronicle commented that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] was the most eventful episode of the season, while Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery thought that [...] "every single major character gets their moment to shine"; [...] "Epic, action-packed, emotional—'Beside the Dying Fire' is great television," [...] she concluded. TV Guide television critic Michael Logan affirmed that the season finale [...] "was <b>so</b> <b>scary</b> and shock-a-minute outrageous that it nearly made our heads explode." [...] In his A– review, Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] adequately accomplished what he was hoping for. He wrote, [...] "We're finally off Hershel's farm, in about the most definitive way imaginable: The barn has been burned, and the house itself is overrun by a herd of 'walkers'." [...] New York Starlee Kine adulated the installment, and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead first season. [...] "It’s just amazing how much smoother the plot holes go down when something is actually happening on this show. For {{the first time since}} last season, I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the small things this show gets wrong. Up until this episode, the majority of this season has consisted exclusively of small things: petty dramas, misdirected stakes, so much stalling. I’m not sure I can {{go so far as to}} say that it got everything right with this one, but at least it was entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program [...] "ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] sufficiently encompassed a climax for its storylines, adding that it left the audience anticipating for future installments of the series.|$|E

Titled Fernkenstein's Monster, it was described as: [...] "Inspired by Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Fern tells a tale <b>so</b> <b>scary</b> that Arthur and the gang become afraid of her. Can Fern prove her skills {{as a writer and}} create a different story that's fun instead of frightening?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Common Sense Media {{criticized the}} film as being [...] "way too silly to be <b>scary,</b> <b>so</b> it never {{delivers}} on its essential promise." [...] DVD Verdict also gave a negative review and questioned its pacing, stating that [...] "After the climax, in which our heroes confront ultimate evil, the movie goes on and on, with a lengthy soccer game and a big dance sequence like the one from Slumdog Millionaire. The whole time, I was wondering, [...] "Why isn't the movie over already?"" ...|$|R
5000|$|Sometime in 1993, Coleman {{released}} his first promotional single, [...] "Devil Son", and {{claimed it was}} the first horrorcore single released. He said he wrote the song because [...] "I've always been a fan of horror flicks. Plus the things I see in Harlem are very <b>scary.</b> <b>So</b> I just put it all together in a rhyme." [...] On February 18, 1993, Coleman performed live at the Uptown Lord Finesse Birthday Bash at the 2,000 Club, which included other performances from Fat Joe, Nas, and Diamond D.|$|R
5000|$|Following the show's abrupt cancellation, Carter said: [...] "It {{might have}} taken us 11 years to make 99 episodes, in my mind. But I wanted to do The Inferno or, as I should say, all of Dante. That was my approach: to try to mimic the 99 cantos. It was a tough sell. It was eight {{characters}} in hell, basically. I think that’s the reason we parted ways." [...] He also cited creative differences with Amazon's executives saying: [...] "With [...] "The After" [...] I wanted to do Dante, I {{wanted to do the}} [...] "Inferno" [...] and it's not a genre piece and <b>so</b> what's <b>scary</b> to people is if it's something they don't recognize. If it's something new or something original. And of course when something original works, then everyone wants to copy it. But if you're trying to do something that no one's ever seen before it's frightening. And I can understand that." ...|$|R

5000|$|Lily Rabe {{commented on}} expecting {{the death of}} her {{character}} Sister Mary Eunice, [...] "It's sort of part of being on this show is you know sort of toward the end of this season there's a high likelihood that's gonna happen. Then I did know when {{that was going to happen}} as things moved along. It wasn't toward later I knew when and how because it wasn't all known early on." [...] She also spoke about doing her own stunts for the death scene, [...] "I did them all! I worked with this incredible stunt double on a couple of things and she was able to work on this job. I had never done wires before. She did some incredible stuff too but I was able to do the whole thing. I was able to do the throw and the fall...I love that stuff. <b>So</b> it's <b>scary</b> to me in the way I love to be scared. I have a little bit of a thrill-seeker in me." ...|$|R

Gathering a perfect rating of 10 out of 10 on IGN, reviewer Eric Goldman stated, [...] "Hannibal ended its fantastic second season with a thrilling, exciting and audacious series of events" [...] and praised the directing by David Slade. The finale also earned a perfect [...] "A" [...] grade by The A.V. Club, where reviewer Molly Eichel called it [...] "an entirely perfect cap to this season." [...] Den of Geek reviewer Laura Akers labelled the episode [...] "simply divine" [...] and stated that she has [...] "rarely found herself {{looking forward to a}} show's return more". Emma Dibdin of Digital Spy also heavily praised the episode, specifically Mikkelsen's performance, stating that he is [...] "so convincingly predatory...and <b>so</b> simultaneously <b>scary</b> and sad". She also laid praise on the sound design of the episode by saying that [...] "the integration of a ticking clock worked so well not just in the usual 'time is running out' way, but also a subconscious reminder of Hannibal's manipulation of Will". TV Guide named it the best TV episode of 2014.|$|R
5000|$|Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter {{criticized the}} film for its cheap {{production}} and screenplay, but was positive towards {{the performances of}} the cast and saying, [...] "the film is ultimately <b>so</b> <b>scary</b> and formulaic that you won't forget it." ...|$|E

50|$|An old tanuki spirit {{who is very}} lazy, {{drinks a}} lot, and is {{determined}} to keep his NEET lifestyle intact. At {{some point in the}} past he was once Kokkuri-san's roommate. Despite his bad behavior, he can't stand to see someone in trouble, especially girls and children. For example, Shigaraki used his pachinko winnings to fund an orphanage inhabited by the children whose families he ruined financially. He also cares for Kohina deeply and allowed a violent spirit she had befriended to curse him so that she wouldn't have to see him kill it. He appears to be interested in both Kokkuri-san and Inugami's female forms. Shigaraki occasionally dresses as Kohina, and his tanuki form was once taken to be <b>so</b> real (and <b>scary)</b> that he later changed the appearance to be cuter so he would be more popular.|$|R
5000|$|Recording {{of the new}} album, The Coldest Winter for a Hundred Years, {{finished}} on 10 September 2010; it {{was released}} early in 2011.

500|$|Conversely, Todd Gilchrist of IGN {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, calling it [...] "a fun, action-filled adventure that will satisfy longtime fans and generate {{a legion of}} new ones, whether it be by virtue of simple storytelling, solid CGI, choreographed action, or just the spirit and energy that only the Turtles can create." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post felt that the film [...] "is technically superb and quite enjoyable {{as long as you}} don't bang your head against the plot, which will cause hot flashes, premature aging and fallen arches." [...] According to Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the film is [...] "not <b>so</b> dark or <b>scary</b> as to keep most kids away" [...] and it [...] "has a cool, noirish sheen.
