It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it was a natural fantasy for the big screen–and a terrific opportunity {{to take advantage of the}} special effects that are available today.|$|E
500|$|Glazunov and Lyadov were {{friendly}} with Tchaikovsky and were charmed by him. Glazunov studied Tchaikovsky's works and [...] "found much that was new... that was instructive {{for us as}} young musicians. It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Tchaikovsky, who was above all a lyrical and melodic composer, had introduced operatic elements into his symphonies. I admired the thematic material of his works less than the inspired unfolding of his thoughts, his temperament and the constructural perfection." ...|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{took the}} name for his {{character}} {{from that of the}} American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies; Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that [...] "It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born".|$|E

500|$|Of {{his time}} in the Army, Gore later stated, [...] "I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to wear my country's uniform." [...] He also later stated that his {{experience}} in Vietnam didn't change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> opponents to the war, including myself, really did {{not take into account the}} fact that there were an awful lot of South Vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom. Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 February 1952, Ian Fleming started writing what would become his first book, Casino Royale, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. He typed out 2,000 words in the morning, {{directly}} from his own experiences and imagination and finished work on the manuscript in just over a month, completing it on 18 March 1952. Fleming took the name for his character {{from that of the}} American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies; Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that [...] "It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born".|$|E
500|$|Some {{have been}} linked to his caustic {{criticism}} of George W. Bush's administration. [...] For instance, his frustration over the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina led him to compare, at a Congressional Black Caucus town meeting in September 2005, Bush to Bull Connor, a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the civil rights movement, stating: [...] "George Bush is our Bull Connor." [...] He said a few days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney, who said, [...] "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me — they were so out of line, it almost <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> there was some — Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess." [...] Rangel responded by saying, [...] "The fact that he would make a crack at my age, he ought to be ashamed of himself ... He should look so good at seventy-five." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My head {{is split}} in two!" [...] he cried. [...] "Who <b>struck</b> <b>me?</b> What, <b>that</b> boy? I'll {{remember}} you, youngster, and some day----" [...] He did not finish.|$|R

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed to moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Unusual Suspects" [...] an A-, and {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "is a love letter to {{the very idea of}} paranoia". Furthermore, VanDerWerff argued that [...] "as the episode moved its way to its climax, when Mr. X improbably lets the Gunmen live after seeing as much as they did [...] it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> what we’re seeing here may not entirely be meant to be taken seriously, just as 'Memoirs Of A Cigarette Smoking Man' [...] is more about who the CSM wished he might have been than the person he actually was. This isn’t a true story; it’s a manifesto." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 6/10, and, while calling the entry [...] "an interesting diversion from the normal format of the series", he noted that [...] "there are still some issues with the plausibility of the story, and ultimately, the questions surrounding Mulder overshadow the character development of the Gunmen themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Amish Tripathi is {{a finance}} {{professional}} educated from Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIM-C). While {{working in the}} insurance industry, Tripathi felt that his life was devoid of any meaning or self. Ultimately {{he decided to take}} the spiritual route. He started reading on the different philosophies and the Indian mythologies. One day, while watching a historical program, Tripathi and his family got into the discussion about consciousness and the evil inside man. In the program they learned that in ancient Persia, demons were known as Daeva (a term reserved for the Gods in Indian mythology), and angels were called Asuras (a term reserved for demons in Indian mythology). Tripathi added, [...] "It set me thinking that this was exact opposite of our Vedic etymology where evil was Asura and gods were Devas. It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> if the two civilizations were to confront each other, they would be at stark odds and calling each other evil." [...] But when he decided {{to write a book about}} the philosophy of evil, his family discouraged him, saying that the subject itself was not popular and would get a narrow audience. They suggested that Tripathi write a thriller/adventure novel and the philosophy should be a part of the story, hence there would be a mainstream appeal in it. Tripathi felt that no subject was better than Shiva, one of the major Hindu deity and the destroyer of evil; his journey and stories about him would deliver the philosophy that he wanted to convey, to his readers. Once he started to write a book about Shiva, he decided to base it on some fundamental beliefs of his. He noted that the Hindu Gods were probably not [...] "mythical beings or a figment of a rich imagination", but rather they were once human beings like the rest. It was their deeds in the human life that made them famous as Gods.|$|E
2500|$|I {{reminded}} them that I haven't played a meaningful soccer game in {{almost two years}} and I certainly couldn't fill the holes left by those players. Over the ensuing days, I {{began to think about}} their inquiries and it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> perhaps this is something I should consider. I care so deeply about the Galaxy organization, and I believe I could help in a small way to aid the team in its quest for a sixth MLS championship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was an odd}} {{expression}} of yours, Captain Hubbell," [...] said Mr. Gibbs, [...] "when you said we had reached longitude everything. It is correct, of course, but it had not <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> in <b>that</b> light." ...|$|R
6000|$|It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> luckily <b>that,</b> {{though he}} {{remained}} as proof against gaiety as ever, he was, {{thanks to his}} preoccupation, not disagreeably affected by my tone. [...] "Of course if you've no idea, I can get nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to think, Fred. Brassy never <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as <b>that</b> sort of a fellow. He's loud-mouthed and he's got a big opinion of himself, and all that, but I never put him down as being crooked." ...|$|R
2500|$|Then he {{came upon}} a copy of Andrea Palladio's Quattro Libri d'archittetura. [...] "You could never believe," [...] {{he wrote to his}} friend and {{long-term}} correspondent Marchesi, [...] "the impression that this book made. Then it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had every reason to consider myself badly guided" [...] before that point (Loukomsky 1928). He turned for new, Neoclassical instruction from Antoine Decrezet, a friend of Winckelmann, and the former's pupil Niccola Giansimoni, measuring and drawing the antiquities of Rome.|$|E
2500|$|... "There were, of course, {{gardening}} programmes on the BBC's schedules, {{but they}} did not deal with the basic facts of botany, or explain how plants feed, how they reproduce and distribute themselves, how they form alliances with particular animals. The reason was only too obvious. How could you construct the dramatic narratives needed for a successful television documentary series if your main characters are rooted to the ground and barely move? Thinking about this, it suddenly <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> plants do move and very dramatically." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} soundtrack by David Schwartz {{does not}} include any songs by the Beatles because [...] "the producers could not get clearance from the notoriously difficult copyright holders, a company owned by Michael Jackson." [...] Critic Jim DeRogatis notes that, [...] "the movie was over before it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the soundtrack was devoid of any Beatles songs [...] Such is our saturation in all things Beatles-related that their actual music isn't even missed in the movie. And maybe that should {{tell us something about}} getting back to what really matters in this group's legacy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I was a deserter this morning," [...] she gravely said. [...] "I had {{to write}} to Eric. Would you--would you mind my telling you {{something}} he said about prayer? It had never <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> in <b>that</b> light before." ...|$|R

60|$|As the {{old lady}} uttered the last words, I thought I saw her eyes turn from heaven, and take the earthly {{direction}} of the sofa in the front parlor. It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> also <b>that</b> her lips looked rather dry. Upon these two hints I spoke.|$|R
2500|$|Gladwell's third book, Outliers, {{published}} in 2008, examines how a person's environment, {{in conjunction with}} personal drive and motivation, affects his or her possibility and opportunity for success. Gladwell's original question revolved around lawyers: [...] "We {{take it for granted}} that there's this guy in New York who's the corporate lawyer, right? I just was curious: Why is it all the same guy?", referring to the fact that [...] "a surprising number of the most powerful and successful corporate lawyers in New York City have almost the exact same biography". In another example given in the book, Gladwell noticed that people ascribe Bill Gates's success to being [...] "really smart" [...] or [...] "really ambitious". He noted that he knew {{a lot of people who}} are really smart and really ambitious, but not worth 60 billion dollars. [...] "It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> our understanding of success was really crude — and there was an opportunity to dig down and come up with a better set of explanations." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1868, {{with the}} {{rebuilding}} of the lodge largely complete: [...] "Reached the Glassalt Sheil at half past 6. It looked so cheerful & comfortable, all lit up & the little rooms are so cosy & nice. The Dining room is {{on the one side}} of the little entrance hall, my sitting room, on the other & my bedroom [...] – beyond. In it stands the old bed & wardrobe in our former little bedroom at Alt na Guithasach. Upstairs the rooms are equally comfortable. Felt sad & lonely, thinking of the blessed happy past with dearest Albert, who always had wished to build here, in this favourite spot. I could not have lived again at Alt na Guithasach now, alone, & it is far better to have built a totally new house, but the sad thought <b>struck</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> it was the first widow's house, – not blessed by him." [...] With five of her children and her Lady of the Bedchamber Jane Spencer, Baroness Churchill, Victoria held a house warming party and then they stayed for the night.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{the idea}} of gaining a day, Verne said of its origin: [...] "I have {{a great number of}} {{scientific}} odds and ends in my head. It was thus that, when, one day in a Paris café, I read in the Siècle that a man could travel around the world in 80 days, it immediately <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I could profit by a difference of meridian and make my traveller gain or lose a day in his journey. There was a dénouement ready found. The story was not written until long after. I carry ideas about in my head for years – ten, or 15 years, sometimes – before giving them form." [...] In his April 1873 lecture, [...] "The Meridians and the Calendar", Verne responded to a question about where the change of day actually occurred, since the international date line had only become current in 1880 and the Greenwich prime meridian was not adopted internationally until 1884. Verne cited an 1872 article in Nature, and Edgar Allan Poe's short story [...] "Three Sundays in a Week" [...] (1841), which was also based on going around the world and the difference in a day linked to a marriage at the end. Verne even analysed Poe's story in his Edgar Poe and His Works (1864). Poe's story [...] "Three Sundays in a Week" [...] was clearly the inspiration for the lost day plot device.|$|E

'I don't think it ever <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> before <b>that</b> there was anything in common between you and Herbert, Ernest, and yet now you point it out I believe there really is something after all.

60|$|The {{absence of}} gulls along {{this stretch of}} reef is a feature <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me.</b> So <b>that</b> {{once in a while}} when I did see a lonely white gull I watched him with pleasure.

6000|$|... "My {{thoughts}} were, so to speak, {{all of a}} piece--one led to another.
