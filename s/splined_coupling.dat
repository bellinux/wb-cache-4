The effect of materials, loads, rotation speed, and surface treatment on friction coefficient, wear coefficient, and wear depth was investigated.

Then, the wear of a floating involute <b>spline</b> <b>coupling</b> of aero-engine was predicted using this method. It can be concluded that carburizing and silvering can decrease the friction coefficient. The wear and wear coefficient decreased after carburizing.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Gearbox Reliability Collaborative (GRC) was established by the U. S.

For as concerns fatigue life, standard design methods consider {{only a part of}} the spline teeth to be in contact and this brings to underestimate the components life, so a better understanding about component fatigue behavior may allow to a weight reduction and a consequent increasing of machine efficiency. On the other hand, wear damage may cause <b>spline</b> <b>coupling</b> run outs; this phenomenon is generally caused by the relative sliding between engaging teeth; the sliding may be due to kinematic conditions (angular misalignment between shafts) of teeth deflection.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of my PhD thesis was to develop design {{criteria}} and to verify procedures about fretting wear, that are applicable to crowned spline couplings of a power transmission system of the aeroengines. Fretting {{is a very complex}} phenomenon being influenced by many factors, the most important being {{the presence or absence of}} lubrication, the load distribution (contact pressure) and the sliding between the bodies. Therefore, the study of fretting needs a deep knowledge of these three main aspects. The first aspect of the problem was based on models and experimental tests considering specify specimens (crowned spline couplings) and imposed movements, so as to uniquely identify the working conditions (load and sliding), in order to facilitate the comparison between the experimental tests and the analytical models. The analytical models have been validated with numerical simulations and by comparison with experimental data, that have been obtained by means of a dedicated test bench that has been designed and built. Thanks to the test rig was possible to determinate the real contact pressure of two engaging teeth; in fact, it is one of the most important parameters affecting the fretting phenomenon, but it is very difficult to evaluate in a quantitative way, especially when considering components with complex geometries.

40|$|AbstractGas {{turbine engines}} {{are widely used}} in both Military and Civil Aircrafts. The power {{generated}} at the turbine is transmitted to compressor through Engine main shafts. These shafts are classified as Class-I critical components of the engine. During the flight operating conditions engine main shafts are subjected to complex loading conditions, such as Torsional, Centrifugal, Thermal, Gyroscopic etc… The combination of these loads lead to multimode failure mechanisms, such as Low cycle Fatigue (LCF), High cycle Fatigue (HCF) and Ductile overload failures in shafts. Designing of shafts for structural integrity is very critical in single engine aircrafts, as the failure of any one shaft may result in the failure of engine, which in turn {{may lead to the}} catastrophic failure of the entire aircraft. The complex geometry of the shafts calls for combination of design tools for stress and life estimation of these parts (both analytical and finite element method (FEM)) backed up by extensive material and component test programs.

40|$|The {{original}} contribution {{of this work}} is modeling of fretting wear in aero-engine spline couplings widely used in aero-industry to transfer power and torque. Their safe operation is very critical with respect to flight safety. They consist of two components namely hub and shaft. As they are of light weight, usually {{it is difficult to}} realize a perfect alignment. To allow for misalignment, their teeth are designed to be of crowned shape. The crowing allows a degree of misalignment without concentration of stresses which is otherwise inevitable if a misalignment is introduced in case of straight teeth. However, crowing results in another problem of fretting wear and fretting fatigue owing to kinematic constraints imposed as a result of misalignment. The focus of this work is development of mathematical models for prediction of fretting wear and not fretting fatigue. The spline couplings under consideration are industrial scale and made up of nitrogen hardened 42 CrMo 4. The aero industry requires a reliable method to model and predict fretting wear to be able to optimize the design of <b>spline</b> <b>coupling</b> and reduce the maintenance costs. Wear tests on crowned spline couplings on a dedicated test bench have been conducted and analyzed. Empirical, artificial neural network based and analytical models have been de- veloped to analyse, predict and formulate fretting wear in spline couplings. The empirical and artificial neural netwrok based models are specific to the given case of spline couplings and tribological conditions. However, the analytical model developed {{has been found to be}} quite general. Incremental fretting wear formulation both in terms of wear volume and wear depth has been realized. Some novel findings regarding effect of roughness parameters in conjunction with applied torque and misalignment angles with respect to fretting wear are also reported. It has been observed that the evolution of wear depth accelerates with increased applied torque or misalignment angle. Changes in roughness parameters are also found to be increasing with torque and misalignment angle in most of the cases.

These results provide the tools needed {{in the design of the}} Runge KuttaWeighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (RK-WENO) method and the Arbitrary high order using high order DERivatives-WENO (ADER-WENO) method. In the RK-WENO method, a WENO reconstruction based on polyharmonic <b>splines</b> is <b>coupled</b> with Strong Stability Preserving (SSP) Runge-Kutta time stepping. The polyharmonic spline WENO reconstruction is also used in the spatial discretisation of the ADER-WENO method. Here, the time discretisation is based on a Taylor expansion in time where the time derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using the Cauchy-Kowalewski procedure. The high order °ux evaluation of the ADER-WENO method is achieved by solving generalized Riemann problems for the spatial derivatives across cell interfaces. Adaptive formulations of the RK-WENO and ADER-WENO methods are used to solve advection problems on unstructured triangulations. An a posteriori error indicator is used to design the adaptation rules for the dynamic modification of the triangular mesh during the simulation. In addition, the flexibility of the stencil selection strategy for polyharmonic spline reconstruction is utilised in developing a WENO reconstruction method with stencil adaptivity. Finally, order variation procedures are combined with mesh adaptation in order to handle regions of the computational domain where the solution is smooth in a different fashion from the vicinity of singularities and steep gradients with the goal of delivering accurate solutions with less computational effort and fewer degrees of freedom when compared to adaptive methods with fixed order of reconstruction.

40|$|The {{integration}} of {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) with computer modeling of aerosol dynamics is needed in several practical applications. The use of a sectional size distribution is desirable because it offers generality and flexibility in describing {{the evolution of the}} aerosol. However, in the presence of condensational growth the sectional method is computationally expensive in multidimensional flows, because a large number of size sections is required to cope with numerical diffusion and achieve accuracy in the delicate coupling between the competing processes of nucleation and condensation. The present work proposes a methodology that enables the implementation of the sectional method in Eulerian multidimensional CFD calculations. For the solution of condensational growth a number conservative numerical scheme is proposed. The scheme is based on a combination of moving and fixed particle size grids and a re-mapping process for the cumulative size distribution, carried out with cubic <b>spline</b> interpolation. The <b>coupling</b> of the aerosol dynamics with the multidimensional CFD calculations is performed with an operator splitting technique, permitting to deal efficiently with the largely different time scales of the aerosol dynamics and transport processes.

The appropriateness of the methodology is evaluated by reproducing the numerically demanding case of nucleation-condensation in an experimental aerosol reactor. The method is found free of numerical diffusion and robust. Good accuracy is obtained with a modest number of size sections, whereas the computational time on a common personal computer remained always reasonable. 3 1...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosphyThis {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with practicable methodologies for delivering comprehensive spatial soil information to end-users. There {{is a need for}} relevant spatial soil information to complement objective decision-making for addressing current problems associated with soil degradation; for modelling, monitoring and measurement of particular soil services; and for the general management of soil resources. These are real-world situations, which operate at spatial scales ranging from field to global scales. As such, comprehensive spatial soil information is tailored to meet the spatial scale specifications of the end user, and is of a nature that fully characterises the whole-soil profile with associated prediction uncertainties, and where possible, both the predictions and uncertainties have been independently validated. ‘Practicable’ is an idealistic pursuit but nonetheless necessary because of a need to equip land-holders, private-sector and non-governmental stakeholders and, governmental departments including soil mapping agencies with the necessary tools to ensure wide application of the methodologies to match the demand for relevant spatial soil information. Practicable methodologies are general and computationally efficient; can be applied {{to a wide range of}} soil attributes; can handle variable qualities of data; and are effective when working with very large datasets. In this thesis, delivering comprehensive spatial soil information relies on coupling legacy soil information (principally site observations made in the field) with Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) which comprises quantitative, state-of-the-art technologies for soil mapping. After the General Introduction, a review of the literature is given in Chapter 1 which describes the research context of the thesis. The review describes soil mapping first from a historical perspective and rudimentary efforts of mapping soils and then tracks the succession of advances that have been made towards the realisation of populated, digital spatial soil information databases where measures of prediction certainties are also expressed. From the findings of the review, in order to deliver comprehensive spatial soil information to end-users, new research was required to investigate: 1) a general method for digital soil mapping the whole-profile (effectively pseudo- 3 D) distribution of soil properties; 2) a general method for quantifying the total prediction uncertainties of the digital soil maps that describe the whole-profile distribution of soil properties; 3) a method for validating the whole-profile predictions of soil properties and the quantifications of their uncertainties; 4) a systematic framework for scale manipulations or upscaling and downscaling techniques for digital soil mapping as a means of generating soil information products tailored to the needs of soil information users. Chapters 2 to 6 set about investigating how we might go about doing these with a succession of practicable methodologies. Chapter 2 addressed the need for whole-profile mapping of soil property distribution. Equal-area <b>spline</b> depth functions <b>coupled</b> with DSM facilitated continuous mapping the lateral and vertical distribution of soil properties. The spline function is a useful tool for deriving the continuous variation of soil properties from soil profile and core observations and is also suitable to use for a number of different soil properties. Generally, mapping the continuous depth function of soil properties reveals that the accuracy of the models is highest at the soil surface but progressively decreases with increasing soil depth. Chapter 3 complements the investigations made in Chapter 2 where an empirical method of quantifying prediction uncertainties from DSM was devised. This method was applied for quantifying the uncertainties of whole-profile digital soil maps. Prediction uncertainty with the devised empirical method is expressed as a prediction interval of the underlying model errors. The method is practicable in the sense that it accounts for all sources of uncertainty and is computationally efficient. Furthermore the method is amenable in situations where complex spatial soil prediction functions such as regression kriging approaches are used. Proper evaluation of digital soil maps requires testing the predictions and the quantification of the prediction uncertainties. Chapter 4 devised two new criteria in which to properly evaluate digital soil maps when additional soil samples collected by probability sampling are used for validation. The first criterion addresses the accuracy of the predictions in the presence of uncertainties and is the spatial average of the statistical expectation of the Mean Square Error of a simulated random value (MSES). The second criterion addresses the quality of the uncertainties which is estimated as the total proportion of the study area where the (1 -α) -prediction interval (PI) covers the true value (APCP). Ideally these criteria will be coupled with conventional measures of map quality so that objective decisions can be made about the reliability and subsequent suitability of a map for a given purpose. It was revealed in Chapter 4, that the quantifications of uncertainty are susceptible to bias as a result of using legacy soil data to construct spatial soil prediction functions. As a consequence, in addition to an increasing uncertainty with soil depth, there is increasing misspecification of the prediction uncertainties. Chapter 2, 3, and 4 thus represent a framework for delivering whole-soil profile predictions of soil properties and their uncertainties, where both have been assessed or validated across mapping domains at a range of spatial scales for addressing field, farm, regional, catchment, national, continental or global soil-related problems. The direction of Chapters 5 and 6 however addresses issues specifically related to tailoring spatial soil information to the scale specifications of the end-user through the use of scale manipulations on existing digital soil maps. What is proposed in Chapter 5 is a scaling framework that takes into account the scaling triplet of digital soil maps—extent, resolution, and support—and recommends pedometric methodologies for scale manipulation based on the scale entities of the source and destination maps. Upscaling and downscaling are descriptors for moving up to coarser or down to finer scales respectively but may be too general for DSM. Subsequently Fine-gridding and coarse-gridding are operations where the grid spacing changes but support remains unchanged. Deconvolution and convolution are operations where the support always changes, which may or may not involve changing the grid spacing. While disseveration and conflation operations occur when the support and grid size are equal and both are then changed equally and simultaneously. There is an increasing richness of data sources describing the physical distribution of the Earth’s resources with improved qualities and resolutions. To take advantage of this, Chapter 6 devises a novel procedure for downscaling, involving disseveration. The method attempts to maintain the mass balance of the fine scaled predictions with the available coarse scaled information, through an iterative algorithm which attempts to reconstruct the variation of a property at a prescribed fine scale through an empirical function using environmental or covariate information. One of the advantages associated with the devised method is that soil property uncertainties at the coarse scale can be incorporated into the downscaling algorithm. Finally Chapter 7 presents a synthesis of the investigations made in Chapters 2 to 6 and summarises the pertinent findings. Directly from the investigations carried out during this project there are opportunities for further work; both in terms of addressing shortcomings that were highlighted but not investigated in the thesis, and more generally for advancing digital soil mapping to an operational status and beyond...|$|R
