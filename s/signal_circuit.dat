[...] The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like ballasted track the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of 100kg support the rails every 60cm and are held by 12mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean encasement concrete. Ballastless track provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains. The corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel-rail vibrations, and are insulators of the track <b>signal</b> <b>circuit</b> in the humid tunnel environment. UIC60 (60kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on [...] rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Mr. Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.|$|E

Consequently, sub-networks corresponding to stimulus-response circuits can directly be related to cell functionalities. Some recent pathway topology based methods focus particularly on the estimation of the activity of stimulus-response <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits</b> from gene expression data [1, 2]. Here, we present PATHiPRED web tool that takes advantage of changes detected in the activity of stimulus-response <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits</b> for predictive purposes. The activation status of elementary components of signaling pathways are rich-informative biomarkers that {{can be linked to}} specific cell functionalities and provide mechanistic explanations for the molecular basis of complex traits. A major challenge in the diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases is to identify relevant alterations in the biological pathway activities and discover their relationship to the disease. Using stimulus-response <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits</b> to distinguish between two classes, such as control and disease samples, or continuous variables, such as drug activity, would improve our understanding of complex phenotypes. PATHiPRED uses the probability of activation of stimulus-response <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits</b> obtained with PATHiWAYS methodology [2] to compute a pathway-based classifier for either two classes or continuous variables.

When the controlling software or firmware decides that no data needs to be sent, it can issue a low-power idle (LPI) request to the Ethernet controller physical layer PHY. The PHY will then send LPI symbols for a specified time onto the link, and then disable its transmitter. Refresh signals are sent periodically to maintain link signaling integrity.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that autocrine signaling through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) might be involved in generating or maintaining an intrinsic polarity in tissue cells, possibly via spatial localization of EGFR-mediated signaling. The difficulty of experimental investigation of autocrine signaling makes especially valuable an application of computational modeling for critical hypotheses about the dynamic operation of the underlying <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits,</b> both intracellular and extracellular. Toward this end, we develop and analyze here a spatially distributed dynamic computational model of autocrine EGFR signaling. Under certain conditions, the model spontaneously evolves into a state wherein sustained signaling is spatially localized on smaller than cell dimension, conferring a polarity to the otherwise nonpolar model cell. Conditions of a sufficiently large rate of autocrine EGFR ligand release and of a sufficiently small exogenous ligand concentration are qualitatively consistent with experimental observations of EGFR-mediated migration. Thus, computational analysis supports the concept that autocrine EGFR <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits</b> could play a role in helping generate and/or maintain an intrinsic cell spatial polarity, possibly related to migration as well as tissue organization. We additionally offer particular suggestions for critical nodes in the EGFR <b>signaling</b> <b>circuits</b> governing this self-organization capability...|$|R
