5|$|By {{the end of}} October the Special Commission on Afghanistan, which {{consisted}} of Andropov, Gromyko, Ustinov and Ponomarev, wanted to end {{the impression that the}} Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policy. The KGB's First Chief Directorate was put under orders that {{something had to be done}} about Afghanistan, and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with the task. Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> Brezhnev that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capabilities to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to assemble a small force to intervene and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal. The Soviet Union declared its plan to intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated Operation Storm-333 (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.|$|E

Edwards also {{appeared}} {{a few weeks}} before the 2012 Daytona 500, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> John Cena that he could wave the green flag for the start of the race; weather postponing the race to Monday kept Cena from doing so as he had to honor a WWE commitment in Portland.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch East Indies had a non egalitarian and patriarchal {{social and}} legal system. Indo {{children}} were for instance only registered as European if the European father decided to acknowledge his children with his indigenous partner. When {{this did not}} happen these Indo children would be assimilated into their mothers’ indigenous community. The colonial <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> describe this phenomenon was “The (Indo) child would disappear into the kampung (English: native village)”.|$|E
25|$|According to his great-great-grandson, d'Alembert {{received}} him rather poorly, {{and to get}} rid of him {{gave him}} a thick mathematics book, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> come back when he had read it. When Laplace came back a few days later, d'Alembert was even less friendly and did not hide his opinion that it was impossible that Laplace could have read and understood the book. But upon questioning him, he realised that it was true, and from that time he took Laplace under his care.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, 15 lawmakers, all Republican, spoke. Many of them {{stressed}} the importance of backing and voting for only candidates whose platform supported antiabortion in the November elections. Among the lawmakers who spoke were Representatives Todd Tiahrt of Kansas, and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania. Tiahrt, who also spoke at the 30th annual march, urged marchers to “help pro-lifers in your state”; Toomey supported these remarks, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> vote for pro-life candidates in order to reclaim the Senate and, in turn, the courts.|$|E

Karou is sent off to Paris via a magical door to get a seven-foot-long {{matching}} pair of elephant tusks. When she finds another portal back to Brimstone's shop, she notices a scorched black handprint on the door, but fortunately she is able to get back home. Similar handprints are appearing across the world. When Karou returns to Brimstone's shop, a violent thud strikes the second door to the shop that Karou is forbidden from investigating.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Buffett {{divested}} his failed {{investment in}} ConocoPhillips, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> his Berkshire investors, I bought {{a large amount}} of ConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in {{the last half of the}} year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40–$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.|$|E
25|$|Berkshire {{previously}} held {{a considerable}} stake in Tesco Plc, the UK grocery retailer. Berkshire {{made its first}} investment in Tesco in 2006 and in 2012 raised this stake to over 5% of the company with a cost for the investment of $2.3 billion. Buffett sold around 30% of this stake in 2013 when he “soured somewhat on the company’s then-management” realising a profit of $43 million. As Tesco's problems mounted through 2014, Berkshire sold all the remaining shares with Buffett <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> shareholders that the delay in selling shares was costly. Berkshire made an after-tax loss of $444 million on the Tesco investment.|$|E

25|$|To {{the jurors}} who voted to acquit him, Socrates gives encouragement: his supernatural daimonion did not {{interfere}} with his conduct of the legal defence, which he viewed {{as a sign that}} such a defence was the correct action. In that way, the daimonion communicated to Socrates that death might be a good thing; either death is annihilation (release from earthly worry) and not to be feared, or death is migration (higher plane of existence) in which reside the souls of personages and heroes, such as Hesiod and Homer and Odysseus. Socrates concludes his self-defence by <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> the court that he bears no ill-will, neither towards his accusers — Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus — nor the jurors. He asks that they ensure the well-being of his three sons, so that they learn to live ethically.|$|E
25|$|In January 1987, the Kohl-Genscher {{government}} {{was returned to}} office, but the FDP and the Greens gained {{at the expense of}} the larger parties. Kohl's CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, slipped from 48.8% of the vote in 1983 to 44.3%. The SPD fell to 37%; long-time SPD chairman Brandt subsequently resigned in April 1987 and was succeeded by Hans-Jochen Vogel. The FDP's share rose from 7% to 9.1%, its best showing since 1980. The Greens' share rose to 8.3% from their 1983 share of 5.6%. Later in 1987, Kohl had a summit with the East German leader Erich Honecker. Unknown to Kohl, the meeting room had been bugged by the Stasi, and the Stasi tapes of the summit had Kohl <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> Honecker that he did not see any realistic chance of reunification in the foreseeable future.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} of 1870 {{was the first}} opportunity for African-Americans to vote in Delaware elections, and Ponder’s tenure was marred by an ongoing response to this change. Ponder himself {{was in no way}} sympathetic, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> the General Assembly that the Federal government was wrong in extending the franchise to “uneducated Negroes.” The 1870 election featured rigged voter lists that effectively denied the vote to most African-Americans, and resulted in all the seats in the General Assembly going to the Democratic Party. Two years later, in response, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant sent in federal troops to police the elections, winning a few elections for Republicans, but undoubtedly prolonging the bitterness felt towards the federal government and their Republican followers in Delaware. The immediate result was the passage of a poll tax and the “Assessment Act of 1873,” that effectively allowed tax collectors the ability to remove people from voter list, allegedly for not paying their taxes, and made it enormously complicated for the voter to have their name restored.|$|E

25|$|Pelléas arrives {{alone at}} the well. He is worried that he has become deeply {{involved}} with Mélisande and fears the consequences. He knows he must leave but first, {{he wants to see}} Mélisande one last time and tell her things he has kept to himself. Mélisande arrives. She was able to slip out without Golaud's noticing. At first she is distant but when Pelléas tells her he is going away she becomes more affectionate. After admitting his love for her, Mélisande confesses that she has loved him since she first saw him. Pelléas hears the servants shutting the castle gates for the night. Now they are locked out, but Mélisande says that it is for the better. Pelléas is resigned to fate too. After the two kiss, Mélisande hears something moving in the shadows. It is Golaud, who has been watching the couple from behind a tree. Golaud strikes down a defenseless Pelléas with his sword and kills him. Mélisande is also wounded but she flees into the woods <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> a dying Pelléas that she does not have courage.|$|E
25|$|In the testy Game 3 of the 2003 ALCS, after {{allowing}} single {{runs in the}} 2nd, 3rd, and 4th innings, Martínez hit Yankees {{right fielder}} Karim García near the shoulders with a pitch, sparking a shouting match between Martínez and the New York bench. Directing his attention at Yankees catcher Jorge Posada, Martínez jabbed a finger {{into the side of}} his own head, which some, including an enraged Yankee bench coach Don Zimmer, interpreted as a threatened beanball. Emotions remained high {{in the bottom of the}} inning, which was led off by Boston slugger Manny Ramírez. Ramirez became irate over a high strike from Roger Clemens, and both benches cleared. During the ensuing commotion, the 72-year-old Zimmer ran towards Martínez in an attempt to knock him down; Martínez sidestepped Zimmer and threw him to the ground. Later, Martínez claimed that he was not indicating that he would hit Posada in the head, but that he would remember what Posada was <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> him. In 2009, Martínez claimed that he regretted the incident but denied being at fault. Zimmer did not give much credence to Pedro's statements. Martínez wrote in 2015 that the altercation with Zimmer was his only regret of his entire career.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} Captain of the Guard {{declared}} his charge to make him prisoner, Cromwell in a rage cast his bonnet on the ground, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> the duke of Norfolk and others of the Privy Council assembled there {{that this was the}} reward of his services, and that he appealed to their consciences as to whether he was a traitor; but since he was treated thus he renounced all pardon, as he had never thought to have offended, and only asked the King not to make him languish long. Thereupon some said he was a traitor, others that he should be judged according to the laws he had made, which were so sanguinary that often words spoken inadvertently with good intention had been constituted high treason. The duke of Norfolk having reproached him with some “villennyes” done by him, snatched off the order of St. George which he bore on his neck, and the Admiral, to show himself as great an enemy in adversity as he had been thought a friend in prosperity, untied the Garter. Then, by a door which opens upon the water, he was put in a boat and taken to the Tower without the people of this town suspecting it until they saw all the King's archers under Mr. Cheyney {{at the door of the}} prisoner's house, where they made an inventory of his goods.|$|E
