5000|$|A {{bill of lading}} that denotes that {{merchandise}} is in {{good condition}} upon being received by the <b>shipping</b> <b>carrier</b> {{is referred to as}} a [...] "clean" [...] bill of lading, while a bill of lading that denotes that merchandise has incurred damage prior to being received by the <b>shipping</b> <b>carrier</b> would be known as a [...] "foul" [...] or [...] "claused" [...] bill of lading. A claused bill of lading will have a statement (clause) written onto the bill of lading noting down any damage or other issues.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this paper is to {{validate}} a clustering procedure used to construct contiguous vehicle routing zones (VRZs) in metropolitan regions. Given a set of customers with random demand for pickups and deliveries over the day, the goal of the design problem is to cluster the customers into zones that can be serviced by a single vehicle. Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the feasibility of the zones with respect to package count and tour time. For each replication, a separate probabilistic traveling salesman problem (TSP) is solved for each zone. For the case where deliveries must precede pickups, a heuristic approach to the TSP is developed and evaluated, also using Monte Carlo simulation. In the testing, performance is measured by overall travel costs and the probability of constraint violations. Gaps in tour length, tour time and tour cost are the measure used when comparing exact and heuristic TSP solutions. To test the methodology, a series of experiments were conducted using data provided by a leading <b>shipping</b> <b>carrier</b> for the Pittsburgh area. Currently, the region is divided into 73 VRZs, compared to 64 indicated by the clustering procedure. The simulation results showed that a redesign would yield approximately $ 334, 360 in annual savings without any noticeable deterioration in service. In addition, when the heuristic TSP model was solved in place of the exact model, the average gap in tour duration increased by only 0. 16 Â hours and 0. 2 Â hours for the cases of 73 clusters and 64 clusters, respectively, indicating a small upward bias. However, runtimes decreased by almost 70 %. Vehicle routing zones Monte Carlo simulation Traveling salesman problem Clustering analysis Pickup and delivery operations...|$|E
40|$|E-services are a {{relatively}} new development in the maritime industry when companies have started to use internet in the contact with the customers. The minimum standard that has developed is to not only give the customer the ability to find the maritime carrier’s schedules online {{but also for the}} customer to be able to track the status of their container using a so called track and trace. These functions are commonly found on a carrier’s own website as well as through online shipping networks. These e-services are linked to the regular customer service that is provided by company’s employees through documentation and booking desks. This study is important as it gives us a deeper understanding of how customers are impacted on by the quality of customer service. This study evaluates the impact of provided services towards the customers by answering the following research questions:  How does the quality of customer service affect the shippers’ choice of carrier?  How would the configuration of e-services affect the customer’s choice of <b>shipping</b> <b>carrier?</b>  What should be considered in the carrier’s establishment of an e-strategy to reach the customers’ expectations of e-services? The study was performed using qualitative interviews with customers within the shipping business. The results of the study show that the quality of customer service has an impact on the choice of carrier but also on further business agreements. It is important for the customer to get a high level of service with emphasis on time of response, availability and correct information. The study has also shown that customers value the attitude of the maritime carrier’s customer service employees as it affects the relationship. Customers want to have access to e-services that facilitate their daily work, and functions as track and trace and schedules online. Other e-service functions of significance are that they will not make the work more time consuming or complicated. A maritime carrier’s implementation of e-service can both harm and also improve a customer relationship depending on the quality if distributed services...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a three-phase procedure for clustering {{a large number}} of data points subject to both configuration and resource constraints. Motivated by the desire of a <b>shipping</b> <b>carrier</b> to reduce its fixed costs, the problem is to construct a set of compact work areas for regional pickup and delivery operations. In general terms, the objective is to find the minimum number of clusters (homogeneous vehicles) that satisfy volume, time and contiguity constraints. The problem is placed in context by formulating it as a mixed-integer goal program. Because practical instances contain anywhere from 6000 to 50, 000 data points and can only be described in probabilistic terms, {{it is not possible to}} obtain provably optimal solutions to the proposed model. Instead, a novel solution methodology is developed that makes use of metaheuristic and mathematical programming techniques. In the preprocessing phase, a fraction of the data points are aggregated to reduce the problem size. This is shown to substantially decrease the computational burden without compromising solution quality. In the main step, an efficient adaptive search procedure is used to form the clusters. Randomness is introduced at each inner iteration to ensure a full exploration of the feasible region, and an incremental slicing scheme is used to overcome local optimality. In metaheuristic terms, these two refinements are equivalent to diversification and intensification search strategies. To improve the results, a set covering problem is solved in the final phase. The individual clusters obtained from the heuristic provide the structure for this model. To test the methodology, six data sets provided by the sponsoring company were analyzed. All runs for the first two phases took less than 4 min, and in all but one case produced a tangible improvement over the current service area configurations. The set covering solution provided further improvement, which collectively averaged 11. 2 %. Clustering Randomized heuristic Pickup and delivery operations Set covering Case study...|$|E
