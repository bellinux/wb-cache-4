5|$|Carrier Air Group 8 (CVG-8) was {{established}} on 15 September 1948 {{in response to}} the Berlin Blockade with newly qualified pilots and reservists who volunteered for active duty. VA-84 and VA-85, the air group's attack squadrons, began receiving Maulers in November and the last aircraft was delivered in January 1949. Later that month the air group made a flyover of President Harry Truman's Inauguration ceremony. The squadron conducted their qualifications aboard the Midway from 3 to 6 May with ten Maulers crashing into the <b>safety</b> <b>barrier</b> between them. CVG-8 made a two-week cruise aboard the Midway beginning on 27 June along the East Coast of the United States, before it was disbanded in November after the peaceful resolution of the Berlin Blockade.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{started from}} pole position, but was {{overtaken}} by Rosberg {{at the first}} corner. Rosberg held the lead {{for the remainder of}} the race, barring brief periods during pit stops, and won by over three seconds. Hamilton remained ahead of Williams driver Felipe Massa to claim the runner-up position. Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel had been holding third position for much of the first half of the race, but a delay due to a stuck wheel nut during his pit stop dropped him into fourth place. Former World Champions Kimi Räikkönen and Fernando Alonso were eliminated on the first lap, after Räikkönen lost control of his Ferrari at the second turn and collided with Alonso. The two came to rest against the <b>safety</b> <b>barrier,</b> with Alonso's McLaren atop the Ferrari.|$|E
5|$|Four {{hours of}} {{practice}} were {{held for the}} field on Wednesday afternoon, but again suffered from variable wet conditions throughout. The No. 17 Porsche once again led the session although Webber was the fastest driver to set the three minutes and 21.362 seconds lap time. Audi closed to within half a second with Loïc Duval's three minutes and 21.950 seconds lap. The LMP2 category had only a single car manage a lap under three minutes and 40 seconds when Richard Bradley set a three minutes and 39.897 seconds lap, a full second ahead of the No. 34 OAK Ligier-Honda. The KCMG car had earlier caused the session to be red flagged when the car {{came to a stop}} at the first Mulsanne Straight chicane. The Murphy Prototypes Oreca-Nissan later caused a second stoppage when Mark Patterson spun in the Porsche Curves entry and heavily impacted the <b>safety</b> <b>barrier.</b> Patterson was unhurt. The LMGTE Pro category was again led by Aston Martin, Richie Stanaway's No. 99 car setting a three minutes and 55.895 seconds lap, followed by the No. 64 Corvette and the No. 97 Aston Martin. Mathias Lauda kept the No. 98 Aston Martin ahead in LMGTE Am, nearly two seconds ahead of the two Proton Porsche cars.|$|E
30|$|The dynamic TENORM {{occupational}} exposure modeling risk {{was based on}} the performance of five identified sequential barriers and their sub-elements that are mostly absent in many oilfields.

40|$|In EU, the new Standards EN 1317 - 1 / 2 {{define the}} {{performance}} classes of road restraint system and induce a growing interest for roadside safety. However, analytical procedures {{are not used}} for the selection of specific roadside safety features at specific locations or {{for the development of}} warrants, policies, and guidelines on a system-wide basis. In this paper, a new benefit/cost analysis procedure, based on an encroachment model, is presented. The new model, called SAFBAR, represents an improvement of the existing procedures and is very useful for selection of performance classses of <b>safety</b> <b>barriers</b> because it takes into account the effective performance level of road <b>safety</b> <b>barriers,</b> basing on the comparison between the impact conditions of the full scale crash tests performed according to the CEN standards and the real world impact conditions. The behavior of the <b>safety</b> <b>barriers</b> in relation to the impact conditions has been studied by performing non-linear dynamic finite element analysis of collisions of HGV against steel road <b>safety</b> <b>barriers.</b> As a result of the study, analytical relationships between barrier’s containment capacity and impact conditions have been obtained. The expressions allow to evaluate the number of vehicles correctly redirected from the <b>safety</b> <b>barriers</b> in relation to the type of road, to the geometrical characteristics of the road, to the traffic volume and composition and to the <b>safety</b> <b>barriers</b> containment level. The procedure allows to compare different types of measures, as relocation of utility poles and protection of utility poles with <b>safety</b> <b>barriers,</b> or measures of the same type carried out with different expenditure, as the installation of <b>safety</b> <b>barriers</b> with different performance levels...|$|R

25|$|A cable barrier, {{sometimes}} referred to as guard cable or wire rope <b>safety</b> <b>barrier</b> (WRSB), is a type of roadside or median safety traffic barrier/guard rail. It consists of steel wire ropes mounted on weak posts. As is the case with any roadside barrier, its primary purpose is to prevent a vehicle from leaving the traveled way and striking a fixed object or terrain feature that is less forgiving than itself. Also similar to most roadside barriers, cable barriers function by capturing and/or redirecting the errant vehicle.|$|E

After Piper {{performed}} a clothesline and kicks, Hogan left the ring. Piper followed, and sent Hogan's {{head into the}} guard rail. Piper then whipped and choked Hogan with a belt. DiBiase distracted Piper, and Hogan fought back, sending Piper's head into the guard rail. Hogan kicked Piper's hip, and applied the abdominal stretch. They exchanged attacks, and The Giant came down. He attempted to perform a chokeslam to Piper. At this point, a fan interrupted the finale by jumping the <b>safety</b> <b>barrier</b> and hitting Ted DiBiase. The Giant was confused by the event and continued to hold Roddy in the chokeslam position. Hogan and referee Randy Anderson ran over and subdued the fan, by kicking him {{several times in the}} ring corner until security arrived.|$|E
40|$|Although run off {{the road}} {{accidents}} frequently occur on horizontal curves the performances of the <b>safety</b> <b>barriers</b> are evaluated by full scale crash tests which are performed on rectilinear <b>safety</b> <b>barriers</b> and no one study aimed at evaluating the <b>safety</b> <b>barriers</b> behavior on curves has been done. In this paper {{the results of a}} study aimed at evaluating the dynamics and the outcomes of the collision of the Heavy Goods Vehicles against the road <b>safety</b> <b>barriers</b> on horizontal curves are reported. The study has been carried out by a numerical approach, which involves simulating collisions with <b>safety</b> <b>barriers</b> through non-linear dynamic finite element analysis. The study has highlighted the factors responsible of the different behavior of the <b>safety</b> <b>barriers</b> on the horizontal curves: the change in the restraint system stiffness and the different yaw motion and vehicle’s velocity change needed to redirect the vehicle in carriageway. The previous factors strongly affect the barrier containment capacity. As far as the maximum transversal barrier displacement is concerned it decreases {{on the outside of the}} curves whereas it increases on the inside. The greater barrier displacement on the inside of the curves causes an increase in the passing over the barrier risk. As far as the vehicle roll over risk is concerned it strongly increases on the outside of the curves, where the {{run off the}} road accidents are significantly greater...|$|R

25|$|On 7 November, 835 Squadron {{claimed a}} Junkers Ju 88 damaged. The long Arctic night with only {{four hours of}} light a day—together with heavy seas and low visibility—hampered any {{operations}} by the Wildcats. In the darkness, the ships could hear the engines of the shadowing German aircraft closing in. Campanias night fighting Fulmar took off at 17:30, but its electrics failed as it was approaching the German aircraft and it was forced {{to return to the}} carrier. The Fulmar landed off centre and crashed into the <b>safety</b> <b>barrier,</b> putting itself and the carrier out of action. On 10 November, a Swordfish on anti-submarine patrol reported 30 Junkers Ju88s approaching the convoy. The Wildcats took off to intercept the torpedo bombers and the escorts opened fire on them. The combined fire from the escorts and the Wildcats shot down four Ju88s, two more were claimed as probably shot down by the Wildcats, and another was severely damaged. Those Ju88s that did release their torpedoes failed to hit any of the ships and a number of the torpedoes were seen to detonate in the ships' wakes, as they turned away from the attack. Two of the Wildcats were also shot down by the barrage from the escorts. The combined losses had reduced the escort's fighter cover to three aircraft, one on Campania and two on Nairana. At 11:30, another group of Ju88 torpedo bombers were discovered approaching. Nairanas Wildcats took off and shot one down. The others, under fire from the escorts, dropped their torpedoes too soon and they all missed.|$|E
500|$|Pilots {{found the}} Mauler a heavy {{handling}} aircraft that {{was difficult to}} fly in formation, and hard to land aboard a carrier because a less-than-perfect landing often caused the aircraft to bounce over the arresting wires and into the <b>safety</b> <b>barrier.</b> It was a very stable dive bomber, {{more so than the}} Skyraider, and could carry more ordnance. Maintenance problems and the difficulty of landing aboard a carrier caused some pilots to give it the nickname of [...] "Awful Monster".|$|E

2500|$|In 1940, Captain M. S. Slattery RN, Director of Air Material at the Admiralty, {{proposed}} a scheme for converting merchant ships into aircraft carriers as {{a follow-up to}} the CAM ship project. [...] Slattery proposed fitting a flight deck equipped with two arrester wires and a <b>safety</b> <b>barrier</b> onto an existing merchant ship hull. [...] The resulting 'auxiliary fighter carrier' {{would be capable of}} operating six Hurricane fighters while retaining its cargo-carrying ability. [...] The stumbling block for Slattery's proposal turned out to be objections from the Ministry of Supply that combining the merchant and aircraft carrier roles would be too complicated. [...] While this {{would turn out to be}} over-stated, it seems to have had the effect of diverting attention away from the idea of hybrid merchant-warships towards the alternative of converting merchant ships into fully-fledged warships designated 'auxiliary aircraft carriers', the first of which, converted from the captured German cargo ship Hannover, entered service as Empire Audacity (later HMS Audacity) in June 1941.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the grain ship and tanker MACs was the provision of hangar space within the grain ships. [...] The three after holds were converted to provide a hangar [...] long, [...] wide to a height of [...] in which the ship's full complement of four Swordfish aircraft could be stowed with wings folded. [...] An elevator platform could lift a fully loaded aircraft from hangar to deck level in less than a minute. [...] It was impracticable to fit tanker MACs with a hangar as this would have entailed very extensive structural alterations and a significant reduction in cargo capacity. [...] Although capable of operating four aircraft, tanker MACs normally embarked three, which all had to be kept on deck: [...] parked aircraft had to be moved to the forward end when other aircraft were landing on, and a collapsible <b>safety</b> <b>barrier</b> was fitted to prevent collisions. [...] Hinged side screens or 'palisades' were fitted around the aft end of the flight deck to provide weather protection for parked aircraft but with only limited effect.|$|E

The strain on the aircrews began to show and only 35 per cent of the original Swordfish crews were still with the ship when they returned to port. It was during this second deployment that one of the ships officers, Sub-Lieutenant J.M. Morrison invented a blind landing system soon to be used on all the Royal Navy carriers.

2500|$|The new-build {{grain ship}} MACs {{were based on}} the Ministry of War Transport's {{standard}} tramp hull which could just accommodate the Admiralty's revised requirement for a flight deck of not less than [...] length and [...] breadth: they were eventually built with flight decks of between [...] [...] The standard design used for the new-build tankers enabled a longer flight deck of approximately [...] with minor variations between individual ships. [...] An important enhancement was specified for the MACs' machinery. [...] A standard diesel tramp engine developed [...] to give a service speed of 11kn. but to provide some margin for flying operations, all the new-build MACs were fitted with engines rated at [...] which, in the grain ships, produced a speed of about 12kn. [...] The new-build tankers with their higher displacements were still capable of 11kn. while the pre-existing 'Triple Twelves' had a service speed of about 10.5kn. [...] The most obvious modification was the flight deck and its supporting structure which was arranged in sections (three on the grain ships; four in the case of tankers) with expansion joints between each. [...] The flight deck was built at the level that would normally have been occupied by the wheelhouse and in the 'Triple Twelves' this entailed removal of the existing wheelhouse and the funnel. [...] The space immediately under the flight deck was utilised for the arrester gear mechanisms, four wires to each MAC with an additional unit fitted to the tankers to operate the trickle wire and <b>safety</b> <b>barrier.</b> [...] A small island structure contained the bridge and wheelhouse and, in the tanker MACs, a chartroom that {{could be used as a}} pilots' briefing room. Less apparent modifications included; accommodation for 107 crew (about 50 more than normal); improved internal subdivision; additional ventilation, including exhaust arrangements that could be adjusted to vent to the leeward side; changes to lifeboat positions; and magazines for the safe stowage of bombs, depth charges, ammunition and pyrotechnics. [...] There were minor variations between the types. [...] In the grain MACs, [...] the armament sponsons or 'zarebas' could not project outboard of the moulded line of the hull which necessitated them encroaching onto the flight deck area so that the ship would not be prevented from using commercial berths, but this constraint did not apply to the tankers whose zarebas were extended outboard of the side. [...] One centre cargo tank in each tanker was adapted for the carriage of aircraft fuel (or 'Avgas') but in the grain ships this necessitated a special compartment containing two pressurised fuel tanks, together with a control room and associated piping.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 February 1945, Campania, Nairana, {{the cruiser}} HMS Bellona and eight fleet destroyers joined 26 {{merchant}} ships in convoy JW64.

Shortly after the escorts and convoy came together Campanias radar operator reported a target approaching. Both carriers scrambled two Wildcats, to intercept the intruder. Campanias Wildcats got there first and shot down a Junkers Ju 88, one of the Wildcats was also shot down with the loss of the pilot. The next morning as 07:45 Campanias radar detected aircraft approaching. Two groups of Junkers Ju 88 torpedo bombers appeared and the convoys escorts opened fire. The ships manoeuvred to avoid the torpedo attack and Nairanas [...] Wildcats were airborne by 08:10. No ships were hit during the attacks and the bombers evaded the fighters in the heavy cloud cover. Campanias Swordfish were flying the daylight anti-submarine patrols, with a mixed armament of four RP-3 rockets and two depth charges. On 7 November 835 Squadron claimed a Junkers Ju 88 damaged. The long Arctic night with only four hours of light a day together with heavy seas and low visibility hampered any operations by the Wildcats.

The return convoy RA 64 left Kola Inlet on the morning of 17 February, one of the escorts and a merchant ship were torpedoed almost immediately. Another merchant ship was torpedoed that afternoon. Terrible weather conditions kept all aircraft grounded until 20 November, when it began to clear the Luftwaffe also appeared and the Wildcats were scrambled to intercept them. Two Ju 88s were shot down by the fighters another two by the escorts and three were damaged. The convoys had lost to enemy action two fighters, two escorts and two merchant ships.
