FMLP and other N-formylated oligopeptides {{were found to be}} similarly active in human neutrophils. [...] The high degree of <b>structural</b> <b>specificity</b> of a broad series of formylated peptides in stimulating these neutrophil responses, the specific binding of N-formylated oligopeptides to neutrophils with affinities that paralleled their stimulating potencies, the ability of t-carbobenzoxy-phenylalanyl-methionine to bind to but not stimulate neutrophils and thereby to block the neutrophil binding and stimulating activity of N-formylated oligopeptides, and the ability of the formylated oligopeptides to desensitize (i.e. render unresponsive) neutrophil functional responses to themselves but have no or a lesser ability to desensitize to a range of other chemotactic stimuli provided strong suggestive evidence that the formylated peptides acted on cells through a common, dedicated receptor system that differed from other chemotactic factor receptors.|$|E

The low-pH {{activity and the}} <b>structural</b> <b>specificity</b> of PCFT (high affinity for folic acid, and low affinity for PT523 - a non-polyglutamable analog of aminopterin) distinguishes this transporter functionally from the other major folate transporter, the reduced folate carrier (optimal activity at pH 7.4, very low affinity for folic acid and very high affinity for PT523), another member (SLC19A1) of the superfamily of solute transporters. Influx mediated by PCFT is electrogenic and can be assessed by current, cellular acidification, and radiotracer uptake. Influx has a Km range of 0.5 to 3µM for most folates and antifolates at pH 5.5. The influx Km rises and the influx Vmax falls as the pH is increased, least so for the antifolate, pemetrexed. The transporter is specific for the monoglutamyl forms of folates. A variety of organic anions inhibit PCFT-mediated transport at extremely high ratio of inhibitor to folate, the most potent are sulfobromophthalein, p-aminobenzylglutamate, and sulfathalazine. This may have pharmacological relevance {{in terms of the}} inhibitory effect of these agents on the intestinal absorption of folates. The PCFT minimal promoter has been defined and contains an NRF1 response element. There is also evidence for a role of vitamin D in the regulation of PCFT with a VDR response element upstream of the minimal promoter.

To clarify which negative physicochemical electrostatic charges on vesicles and <b>structural</b> <b>specificities</b> of acidic lipids {{are critical to}} complement activation, the electrostatic properties and activity to complement of two anionic vesicles modified with a carboxylic acid derivative or a conventional acidic phospholipid were compared. Electrophoretic mobility measurements indicated that the negative zeta potential and the electrostatic interactivity of these two anionic vesicles were equal at pH 7. 4. However, the infusion of vesicles containing acidic phospholipid induced significant complement activation, while vesicles containing the carboxylic acid derivative failed to activate complement. These {{results indicate that the}} negative charge on the surface of vesicles is not critical for the activation complement, suggesting that complement activation is specific to the structure of acidic groups.

40|$|The advent {{and early}} {{developments}} of reinforced concrete {{were related to}} national patenting. This paper proposes an in-depth study of the logic of reinforced concrete patents {{at the turn of}} the 20 th century, based on the case of Belgium. Before the First World War, a considerable number of systems were patented by private inventors for commercial purposes. Patents on reinforced concrete constitute today a primary source of information, both for their technical content and for the assessment of the market penetration of the innovative material. The scientific reliability of these patents is variable and ranges from the rational to the unrealistic. Propagation of reinforced concrete occurred following international trends, such as Hennebique or Monier, or by local inventors, mainly building contractors. Reinforced concrete started to be considered as a structural material after the French engineering standard of 1906, adopted by Belgium. Moreover, examining these patents helps to understand the <b>structural</b> <b>specificities</b> of the early phase of reinforced concrete.
