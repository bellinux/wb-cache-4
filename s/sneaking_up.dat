Donelly and Gates bring Helen into the station, where they inform her Hal is the Creeper and accuse her of harboring a murderer. Reluctantly, she agrees {{to help them}} capture him. The next day, the newspapers run stories about Helen cooperating with police, which infuriates Hal. Feeling betrayed, he sneaks back into her apartment and finds her playing the piano. <b>Sneaking</b> <b>up</b> from behind, Hal is about to strangle her when the police seize and arrest him. The film ends with Donelly and Gates assuring Helen she will get the operation she needs.|$|E
5|$|Stealth {{is based}} on {{limiting}} the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, {{and as long as}} Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also look through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms. <b>Sneaking</b> <b>up</b> behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead bodies can be moved and hidden.|$|E

5|$|Mario and Princess Peach {{are walking}} {{together}} when lightning suddenly strikes Peach's castle nearby. As Mario runs to help, Bowser Jr. appears, <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> on the Princess {{from behind and}} kidnapping her. Realizing what has happened, Mario quickly rushes back and gives chase. Mario ventures through eight worlds pursuing Bowser Jr. and trying to rescue the kidnapped princess. Mario catches {{up to them and}} confronts Bowser Jr. occasionally, but is unable to save the princess from the young Koopa's clutches. At {{the end of the first}} world, Bowser Jr. retreats to a castle, where his father, Bowser, awaits Mario on a bridge over a pit filled with lava. In a scene highly reminiscent of the original Super Mario Bros., Mario activates a button behind Bowser to defeat him, and the bridge underneath Bowser collapses, causing him to fall into the lava which burns his flesh, leaving a skeleton.|$|E
5|$|In Challenge mode, {{the player}} must sneak around and deliver food to hungry NPCs. Hunger is {{indicated}} above thought bubbles which float above {{the heads of}} the NPCs. An NPC with a burger icon over their head is able to be given food, but they will lose their appetite if they spot the player. NPCs move around the map in a set pattern and have a narrow cone of vision to detect player. Erik Brudvig of IGN described this narrow cone of vision as being similar to those of Metal Gear Solid. NPCs can also detect the player by excessive noise, the amount of sound a player is making is indicated by a noise meter. Challenges can be failed if a player alerts NPCs to their presence. Successful delivery of an item requires <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> behind an NPC or surprising them from a hiding place. Points are awarded based on how hungry a character is, the player's stealth and proximity to the NPC and style points on delivery. When presenting food, a Flourish meter appears which quickly fills and empties, requiring a timed button press. The higher the flourish meter, the more style points. Each level has 20 associated challenges and fulfilling half the challenges on a level opens the way to the next level. Once all 80 challenges are completed, an alternative costume is unlocked. Gamerscore is rewarded for achieving certain goals or style on the Xbox 360 version.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{is divided into}} 14 missions in which the player plays as Joanna Dark. Each mission provides a number of objectives that the player has to complete to progress. To successfully clear a mission, the player must complete all primary objectives, and if Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player will have to start the level again. The missions also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score. Some objectives require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, a device called Datathief allows the player to hack into electronic devices, while another called Loctopus {{can be used to}} open locked doors. Stealth is another important element of the gameplay, as the player is often given the freedom to kill enemies without being detected by <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> behind them. Unlike the original Perfect Dark, every mission contains a single checkpoint at which the player may restart if Joanna is killed or loses beyond that checkpoint. However, checkpoints are removed as the player plays through a higher difficulty. There are four difficulty settings through which a mission can be played: Agent, Secret Agent, Perfect Agent, and an extra one called Dark Agent, which becomes available once the player completes the entire game on Perfect Agent. As the player plays on higher difficulties, the game adds more objectives and makes enemies tougher to increase the challenge.|$|E

Also on the guest list is womanizing doctor Maxwell (Roberts) and his latest girlfriend, free-thinking nurse, Dulcy (Hagerty).

25|$|In {{regards to}} the predatory {{behavior}} of A. decemarticulatus, similar behaviors have been observed in other ant species, such as symbioses with plants (like in Pseudomyrmex ferruginea), cultivating a fungus (like in leafcutter ants), and <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> to and ambushing larger prey (like in Azteca andreae, another species studied by Dejean). However, most remarkably, Allomerus decemarticulatus seems to incorporate each of these advanced behaviors to make a powerful apparatus for tricking impressively large prey.|$|E
25|$|The {{player can}} direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire {{to kill his}} enemies. The player can also have Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth to take them out, such as by <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> behind them and killing them with one hit, or by {{dropping}} down onto an enemy whilst Drake is hanging from a ledge. The stealth mechanic has been simplified and improved. Some areas of the game will require the player to solve puzzles {{with the use of}} Drake's journal, which provides clues towards the puzzles' solutions. When enabled, a hint system provides gameplay clues, such as the direction of the next objective.|$|E

Madison, investigating the Origami Killer, intends on interviewing Leland White, a taxidermist and possible suspect. However, when she arrives, he is not home, so thus she sneaks in. In his house, she discovers a murdered woman in a bloody bathtub, and in another room numerous stuffed and posed corpses of women. Depending on the player's actions, Madison may end <b>up</b> <b>sneaking</b> out without Leland noticing, be noticed but manage to escape regardless, kill Leland, be killed herself, or phone the police and hide until they come.|$|R
25|$|Uncharted 2 is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{video game}} played from a third-person view, with the player {{in control of}} Nathan Drake. Drake is physically adept {{and is able to}} jump, climb, and scale narrow ledges and wall-faces to get between points. Drake can be equipped with up to two firearms – one single-handed and one two-handed – and a limited supply of grenades. Drake can pick up weapons, automatically replacing the existing weapon he was using, and additional ammunition from slain enemies. The player can direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire to kill his enemies. The player can also have Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth to take them out, such as by <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> behind them to knock them out with one hit, or by pulling an unsuspecting foe over a ledge from which Drake is hanging. In most areas, if all of the foes patrolling are killed stealthily then other waves that would normally appear do not. Some areas of the game require the player to solve puzzles with the use of Drake's journal, which provides clues towards the puzzles' solutions. When enabled, a hint system provides gameplay clues, such as the direction of the next objective.|$|E
500|$|Criticism was {{leveled at}} the game's {{difficult}} gameplay {{due to the}} scarcity of health and ammunition. The weak artificial intelligence of enemies and superficial stealth mechanics were also noted. According to GameSpot, [...] "in theory you should be <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> on enemies, defusing bombs, and saving hostages. In practice, however, enemies turn around and attack even when you're <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> on them and defusing bombs requires no effort, so the suggestion of strategy is moot." [...] The size of the player character was also a subject of criticism {{because it does not}} allow players to properly see their immediate surroundings, prompting them to accidentally alert nearby enemies. Although the different mini-games were highlighted, reviewers felt that they were clearly imitative of games like Spy Hunter and Operation Wolf.|$|E
500|$|The {{acclaimed}} Metal Gear series {{continued with}} [...] (PlayStation 2; 2001) which further evolved the stealth gameplay.

6000|$|It was {{beautiful}} to see Jerusalem rounding {{the angle of}} a wall, and turning his head about to observe how {{the remainder of the}} procession was coming on. He was once circumnavigating a small out-house, when, catching sight of his own hinder-quarters, he flew into a terrible rage. The sight of another dog always had this effect upon Jerusalem, and more especially when, as in this case, he thought he could grasp an unfair advantage. So Jerusalem took after that retreating foe as hard as ever he could hook it. Round and round he flew, but the faster he went, the more his centrifugal force widened his circle, until he presently lost sight of his enemy altogether. Then he slowed down, determined to accomplish his end by strategy. <b>Sneaking</b> closely <b>up</b> to the wall, he moved cautiously forward, and when he had made the full circuit, he came smack up against his own tail. Making a sudden spring, which must have stretched him like a bit of India-rubber, he fastened his teeth into his ham, hanging on like a country visitor. He felt sure he had nailed the other dog, but he was equally confident the other dog had nailed him; so the problem was simplified to a mere question of endurance--and Jerusalem was an animal of pluck. The grim conflict was maintained all one day--maintained with deathless perseverance, until Dad Petto discovered the belligerent and uncoupled him. Then Jerusalem looked up at his master with a shake of the head, as much as to say: [...] "It's a precious opportune arrival for the other pup; but who took him off me?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2006 Panahi made Offside. In the film, a {{group of}} young Iranian girls {{disguise}} themselves as boys to sneak into Azadi Stadium to watch the World Cup qualifying football playoff game between Iran and Bahrain. The film was partially shot during the actual game it depicts. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution women have been banned from attending football matches in Iran on grounds of rowdy and aggressive language, lewd behavior, and seeing men in shorts and short sleeve shirts. At one point Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had wanted to repeal the law but was overruled by the ulema. Panahi has stated [...] "I use the football game as a metaphor to show the discrimination against women on a larger scale. All my movies have that topic at their center. This is what I am trying to change in Iranian society." [...] The film was inspired by an incident several years earlier when Panahi's daughter was refused entry to a football stadium but ended <b>up</b> <b>sneaking</b> into the stadium anyway.|$|R
500|$|Cow tipping is {{the purported}} {{activity}} of <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> on any unsuspecting or sleeping upright cow and pushing it over for entertainment. The practice of cow tipping {{is generally considered}} an urban legend, and stories of such feats viewed as tall tales. The implication that rural citizens seek such entertainment {{due to lack of}} other alternatives is viewed as a stereotype. However, cows only sleep lightly while standing up, and they are easily awakened. They lie down to sleep deeply. Furthermore, numerous sources have questioned the practice's feasibility, since most cows weigh over half a ton and easily resist any lesser force.|$|E

These mechanics {{include the use of}} stealth, in which players are challenged to kill enemies by <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> behind them without making noise (e.g. running or reloading weapons), complete a memory type game that involves pressing various buttons in a specific order to open up doors, and shoot targets from a first-person perspective.|$|E
500|$|A line {{in which}} Dwight tells Andy that Angela [...] "certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking" [...] was improvised by Wilson. Much of the {{dialogue}} between Andy and Dwight during the duel scene was also improvised. It was writer Paul Lieberstein, who served as show runner along with Celotta at the time, who suggested the idea of Andy <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> on Dwight with his Toyota Prius. The original script called for the entire office cast {{to come down to}} the parking lot from the Dunder Mifflin office to try to stop Dwight and Andy from fighting. However, the staging proved awkward during filming, so John Krasinski suggested that only Jim go down to the parking lot while the others stayed behind, and the change was eventually incorporated into the episode.|$|E

500|$|Dark Angel is a single-player beat 'em up {{game played}} {{from a third}} person view. Players take control of Max Guevara, a genetically-enhanced super soldier. [...] Levels involve {{fighting}} enemies while following a fairly straightforward path to the level's exit.

She can also perform moves like back flips and side twirls to evade enemies. Occasionally Max may have {{to interact with the}} environment to advance past a point, such as placing an explosive on a door, though what is required to progress through the level is clearly highlighted to the player. Max receives communications from Logan Cale, who offers his advice on how she may reach objectives. The game also presents 'stealth mode' sequences during some levels. In stealth mode, Max can distract enemies by making noise or perform stealth kills by <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> on them.

He doesn’t let it break very often. He does not let anyone see his true feelings, and I think the reason he is such a player is, and it’s my take on it now, is that it’s for that very reason.

He is bow-legged and walks with an affected stagger, presumably brought on by arthritis or perhaps, given his penchant for the ladies, syphilitic myelopathy, which can cause difficulty in walking. Fred never gives much credit to his son Lamont, believing him to be gullible and unintelligent. He most often refers to Lamont as a [...] "big dummy". Unhappy about his calling as a junk man, Lamont accepts his plight more {{for the love of}} his father than the junk business itself. Fred often involves himself in various get-rich-quick schemes, and as such, Lamont has to keep constant watch over his father. When Lamont would express an interest in having a life for himself, Fred would try to convince him of the importance of running the family business (which he referred to as [...] "the empire") after he is gone. Fred often feigned illness in attempt to guilt his son into staying home and taking care of him whenever Lamont had plans to go out. Similarly, Fred often ruined Lamont's efforts to have a quiet romantic night at home with a lady companion (at one point, Fred repeatedly interrupted Lamont's amorous efforts so often that the young lady ended <b>up</b> <b>sneaking</b> away while Fred and Lamont argued loudly in the kitchen).|$|R
