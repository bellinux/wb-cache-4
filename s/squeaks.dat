5|$|The calls made by caecilians and {{salamanders}} {{are limited}} to occasional soft <b>squeaks,</b> grunts or hisses and have not been much studied. A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation, as in bats, or a form of communication. Most salamanders are considered voiceless, but the California giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus) has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound. Some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.|$|E
5|$|The {{rippling}} preep and whistled sweeeooo {{calls of}} the Alpine chough {{are quite different}} from the more typically crow-like chee-ow vocalisations of the jackdaw and the red-billed chough. It also has a rolling churr alarm call, and a variety of quiet warbles and <b>squeaks</b> given by resting or feeding birds. In a study of chough calls throughout the Palearctic region it was found that call frequencies in the Alpine chough showed an inverse relationship between body size and frequency, being higher-pitched in smaller-bodied populations.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live {{in groups}} typically of 10–30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single {{individuals up to}} more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including <b>squeaks</b> and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.|$|E

50|$|The second issue, <b>Squeak</b> the Mouse 2, {{begins with}} a duck who revives <b>Squeak</b> {{from the pages of}} the first <b>Squeak</b> the Mouse comic book. <b>Squeak</b> {{proceeds}} to read his own comic, and is horrified by his own murder, and decides to track down the cat and murder him. However, when <b>Squeak</b> confronts the cat at a screening of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, the cat tricks <b>Squeak</b> into feeling sympathy for him, which allows the cat to briefly escape before being murdered by the mouse. As <b>Squeak</b> boards a plane heading to a tropical island, the cat returns as a zombie and crashes the plane, killing all of the passengers except <b>Squeak,</b> who escapes, and swims to the nearest island, where a pair of women awaken him by performing oral sex on <b>Squeak,</b> leading to another orgy sequence. The cat turns up on the island and slaughters the women, and <b>Squeak</b> destroys the cat, leaving only its separated bones, which are found by a horror film-loving child, who brings the remains home and reassembles them. The skeleton cat slaughters the child and his family, and once again goes after <b>Squeak,</b> who finally gets rid of the cat for good, but decides to antagonize another cat.|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{incidence of}} <b>squeaking</b> {{has been reported}} with increasing frequency, with ceramic-on-ceramic bearings seemingly most affected. This study investigated potential causes of <b>squeaking</b> in hard-on-hard hip bearings through 2 sets of experimental conditions. Bearing clearance appeared to affect the incidence of <b>squeaking</b> in metal-on-metal surface arthroplasties. The addition of third-body particles to the interface for total hip arthroplasties also affected the incidence of <b>squeaking.</b> In both studies, the incidence of <b>squeaking</b> correlated well with elevated friction. The {{findings of this study}} suggest that a likely cause of <b>squeaking</b> in the hip arthroplasty is adverse tribological conditions caused by suboptimal lubrication. There are numerous factors that may cause the suboptimal lubrication, and therefore, it is unlikely that an individual cause for <b>squeaking</b> will be identified...|$|R
5|$|There {{are eight}} {{distinct}} call types made by Sunda slow loris adults, {{which can be}} divided into two categories: contact and contact-seeking calls such as whistles and short keckers (a social play and attention-seeking call), and aggressive and defensive calls such as long keckers, screams, snarls and grunts. Because they rely on crypsis to avoid predators, they do not make alarm calls. Infants emits clicks and <b>squeaks</b> when disturbed. During estrus, females make whistle calls when in visual contact with a male. When exploring new environments and during handling, it makes ultrasonic vocalisations out of the human hearing range.|$|E
5|$|After a {{gestation}} {{of about}} 25 days, {{three to five}} young are usually born, although litter sizes vary from one to seven. Females may have up to six litters a year. Newborns weigh 3 to 4g (about 0.10 to 0.15oz) and are blind and almost naked. About as many males as females are born. The external ears (pinnae) soon unfold and on the first day, claws are visible and the young emit high-pitched <b>squeaks.</b> On the second day, {{they are able to}} crawl, and during the third to fifth days, the whiskers and eyelids develop. On the two subsequent days, the mammae and incisors become visible and the animals become more active. Between the eighth and 11th days, the eyes open, the fur develops, and the young begin to take solid food. Weaning occurs on the 11th to 20th day, according to different studies. Considerable variation is reported in body masses at different ages, perhaps because of geographic variation. Sexual activity commences when the animals are about 50 to 60days old. In the wild, rice rats usually live for less than a year; one study suggested that the average lifespan is only seven months.|$|E

25|$|The bats use audible {{calls to}} {{communicate}} with each other. When at rest, they chirrup; when faced with an aggressive situation, they screech. They use social communication, touch, and chemical cues. In its home continent of Africa, it is well known for the <b>squeaks,</b> chirrups, and other noises that it makes that are barely audible to humans.|$|E
25|$|Their {{feathers}} {{are excellent}} at shedding water due to special oils. Many of the ducks display sexual dimorphism, with the males being more brightly coloured than the females (although {{the situation is}} reversed in species such as the paradise shelduck). The swans, geese, and whistling-ducks lack sexually dimorphic plumage. Anatids are vocal birds, producing a range of quacks, honks, <b>squeaks,</b> and trumpeting sounds, depending on species; the female often has a deeper voice than the male.|$|E
25|$|Exclusively herbivorous, {{the animal}} forages for the tender shoots and leaves {{of more than}} 115 species of plants (around 30 are {{particularly}} preferred), moving slowly through the forest and pausing often to eat and note the scents left behind by other tapirs in the area. However, when threatened or frightened, the tapir can run quickly, despite its considerable bulk, and can also defend itself with its strong jaws and sharp teeth. Malayan tapirs communicate with high-pitched <b>squeaks</b> and whistles. They usually prefer to live near water and often bathe and swim, and they are also able to climb steep slopes. Tapirs are mainly active at night, though they are not exclusively nocturnal. They tend to eat soon after sunset or before sunrise, and they will often nap {{in the middle of}} the night. This behavior characterizes them as crepuscular animals.|$|E

25|$|Females usually {{give birth}} to a single infant, {{although}} twins do occur. Most births occur during the night. Infants are born with thin, dark brown or black hair and pale skin. Infants spend their first week attach themselves to their mothers' chests and mostly just suckle or sleep. They do not move much in terms of locomotion for {{the first two weeks of}} their life. As they approach their sixth week of life, infants vocalize more. They use <b>squeaks</b> and shrieks to communicate stress. In the following months, the infants are capable of quadrupedal locomotion and can walk, run and jump by the second and third months. Alloparenting occurs among langurs, starting when the infants reach two years of age. The infant will be given to the other females of the group. However, if the mother dies, the infant usually follows. Langurs are weaned by 13 months.|$|E

40|$|Ceramic-on-ceramic {{bearings}} in THA are {{a popular}} alternative to overcome wear concerns in traditional metal-polyethylene bearings. However, <b>squeaking</b> is a potentially worrisome phenomenon in ceramic-on-ceramic THAs which we observed {{in some of}} our patients. We reviewed all 42 patients who underwent 43 ceramic-on-ceramic noncemented THAs {{during the time of}} the study. <b>Squeaking,</b> defined as a reproducible sound of <b>squeaking,</b> clicking, or grating, occurred in nine of 43 implants (20. 9 %). Standard radiographs were normal. We used CT imaging to determine cup anteversion and inclination angles, comparing the <b>squeaking</b> hips with those of a randomly selected control group, but found no differences. We then hypothesized specific design features (stem size, cup size, head size, and neck length of the head) would be risk factors for <b>squeaking.</b> We found a difference in neck length between <b>squeaking</b> and nonsqueaking implants. A neck length of − 4  mm or shorter resulted in a relative risk of 5. 56 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 14 – 27. 01) for <b>squeaking.</b> We found a high incidence of <b>squeaking</b> in our population, and we believe this phenomenon is an underreported side effect of these types of bearings.
