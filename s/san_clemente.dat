5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, the Conservancy worked to {{preserve}} the <b>San</b> <b>Clemente</b> Island goat, a rare Spanish-descended breed from California. In 1991, it added genetic material from the <b>San</b> <b>Clemente</b> to their genetic database, later transferred to the National Animal Germplasm Program. As of June 2010, the organization {{was working on the}} rescue of a group of feral Spanish goats from an island in South Carolina. There are less than 2,500 members of the breed in the United States, and the island group is one of only two bloodlines known to exist in the southeastern US. Conservancy members first made trips to the island to document and photograph the herd of around 30 goats, then undertook action to remove some goats from the island to preserve the bloodlines from threatened extinction. A small flock was established in a nature preserve just south of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, and as of June 2010 plans were in place for satellite herds to be established.|$|E

The freeway was completed east to I-805 in 1970, and was built in two stages from there to Santo Road east of I-15; the last phase was completed in 1988.|$|E

40|$|This {{professional}} project assesses {{current conditions}} and regulations within <b>San</b> <b>Clemente’s</b> Coastal Zone, and provides {{recommendations to the}} City and California Coastal Commission through a draft Land Use Plan. The amended Land Use Plan {{will be included in}} the certified Local Coastal Program, which will govern decisions that determine the short and long-term conservation and use of coastal resources within <b>San</b> <b>Clemente’s</b> Coastal Zone. Local Coastal Programs (LCPs) are planning guides used by local governments for development within the Coastal Zone. They contain goals and policies for development and protection of coastal resources throughout coastal cities and counties in California. LCPs identify appropriate locations for various land uses based on their goal of environmental and sustainable development and growth. Each LCP contains two components: a Land Use Plan (LUP) and an Implementation Plan (IP). Generally, the LUP contains the Coastal Element of the General Plan and provides the overall goals and policies that protect a City’s coastal resources. The IP is intended to implement the goals and policies in the City’s Land Use Plan and includes sections of the City’s Zoning Ordinance, and Specific Plans within the Coastal Zone. Although each LCP is unique to a coastal community, they all need to maintain statewide regulations through conformity with the Coastal Act requirements. After the California Coastal Commission (CCC) has approved an LCP, the coastal permitting authority over most new development is transferred to the local government, but the CCC retains permanent coastal permit jurisdiction over all proposed development on public trust lands, tidelands, and submerged lands. The CCC will also review and approve any amendments to previously certified LCPs...|$|R

5|$|SR52 begins {{just west}} of I-5 at {{the eastern end of}} La Jolla Parkway. Before {{entering}} <b>San</b> <b>Clemente</b> Canyon, the road becomes a freeway as it intersects I-5. The canyon is part of Marian Bear Natural Park. The freeway runs north of the Rose Canyon Fault, composed of Late Cretaceous rock estimated to be 90million years old, and Mount Soledad.

The entire route is known as both the Soledad Freeway and the <b>San</b> <b>Clemente</b> Canyon Freeway. In 2013, SR52 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 69,000 at the eastern terminus with SR 67, and 103,000 between Convoy Street and SR163, the lowest and the highest AADT for the highway, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Even though Agatha passed {{close to}} Mexico as it weakened, no impact {{is known to}} have been caused. Waves caused by Agatha did impact a ship called the Polynesian Diakan. A Greek {{freighter}} en route from Pago Pago to Terminal Island, California, the Polynesian Diakan began flooding on June 3, forcing the 32-man crew to abandon the vessel. The exact cause of the initial flooding was unknown, but was speculated to be primarily due to cargo shifting and not the weather. The crew was rescued by the United States Coast Guard. Three members required hospitalization. After being reached on June 6 by a tugboat in a salvage attempt, the vessel capsized and sank near <b>San</b> <b>Clemente</b> Island on June 7, taking its multimillion-dollar cargo of 71 containers of canned tuna with it.

In the first of them, the introduction, I speak about the current state of preliminar typobibliographic investigation about printing in Madrid, including the rewiew of previous bibliographies by Cristóbal Pérez Pastor, Antonio Sierra Corella, Yolanda <b>Clemente</b> <b>San</b> Román and Justa Moreno Garbayo.

The typobibliographies dealing with the works performed in Madrid are uncompleted and imperfect so that, with this doctoral stablishes that the almost definitive corpus of those books printed in Madrid from 1626 to 1636. The last year of this period is explained because of the enormous amount of printed matter that were produced during the previous years, so completing the study of the decade would have been an impossible task. The abridget objetives of this dissertation are: - To stablish the definitive corpus of the printed matter from 1626 to 1636. - To present an analytical description of this printed matter based on the material bibliography rules. - To find new editions and issue and states variants in the already known editions. - To determine the view of the existing presses in Madrid in that time with a tipographic research about each press [...] ...|$|R
