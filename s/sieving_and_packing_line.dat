This experimental {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of distillery effluent on hydraulic conductivity of a sandy loam alluvial soil and compare the effect of inorganic salts of potassium (K) with that of distillery effluent on hydraulic conductivity of soil. The treatments consisted of 4 sources of K: potassium chloride, potassium sulphate, post methantion distillery effluent (PME) and oxidized PME (PME minus organic carbon) at 4 levels equivalent to 10, 20, 40 and 100 % of the K concentration in the PME.

30|$|The {{optimization}} {{results for}} the gas system are shown in Figs.  6 b, c, which present the expectations of gas production <b>and</b> <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> respectively. In our study, gas wells are the main gas source, and gas derived from storage facilities is employed over all periods owing to its economic efficiency. In addition, Fig.  6 c indicates that <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> {{also serves as a}} means of gas storage; indeed, the range of <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> exceeds the combined range of well production and gas storage over the modelled period. Two gas well supply peaks are shown in Fig.  6 b, where the first peak corresponds to a gas demand peak and the second peak corresponds to a power supply peak.

40|$|Temperatures well {{in excess}} of the lethal {{threshold}} for roots (60 °C) have been measured in forest soils when woody fuels are burned. Whether this heat pulse is strongly moderated by soil moisture or soil texture is not fully understood, however. We measured soil heat profiles during 60 experimental burns, identifying changes in maximum soil temperature and heat duration above 60 °C as a function of soil moisture and soil texture. Experimental treatments included a factorial combination of soil moisture (~ 5, 15, 30, and 45 % v/v) and soil textural (sandy loam, sandy loam–pumice, loam, clay loam) gradients, with a surface fuel load comprised of a dense layer of masticated wood. Soil moisture had a strong influence on heat transfer. A volumetric moisture content of 20 % or greater quenched the heat pulse in all soils at depths of 2. 5 cm and lower. In comparison, soil temperatures in dry soil far exceeded the lethal threshold to a depth of 10 cm. Differences in heating characteristics among the four soil types were minor despite their dissimilarities in texture, porosity, bulk density, and presumed thermal conductivity. It was also shown that intact soil cores were required to produce accurate heat profiles during burning, as maximum soil temperatures in the surface 5 cm were overestimated by 40 to 100 °C using disturbed soil (<b>sieved</b> <b>and</b> <b>packed).</b> The empirical results along with a simple predictive model of soil heating show that burning of woody fuels when underlying soils have 20 % volumetric moisture or greater is an effective means for limiting lethal heating in a variety of soils.

40|$|The litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is a {{tropical}} to subtropical fruit. It {{is a popular}} export commodity due to its attractive skin colour and exotic flavour. The fruit has a rough indehiscent pericarp (skin) surrounding the succulent, edible aril and a seed in the centre. Pericarp browning, postharvest decay and micro-cracking are identified as major constraints affecting the commercial quality of litchi during storage, transportation or at the consumer shelf. Desiccation or moisture loss from the pericarp and mechanical injury due to improper postharvest handling practices during the fruit export chain ultimately result in browning. Micro-cracking was also observed preharvestly during fruit developmental stages, and postharvestly due to poor handling practices <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> <b>line</b> operations. The micro-cracks on the pericarp act as ports of entry for the invasion of postharvest pathogens during cold storage and transportation. Although pericarp browning caused by desiccation does not severely affect the sensory attributes of litchis, mechanical injury and postharvest decay can cause deleterious effects on the sensory attributes of litchi fruit. Pericarp browning and postharvest decay during storage and transportation are currently controlled by adopting sulphur dioxide fumigation in many litchi exporting countries. However, sulphur dioxide fumigation leaves undesirable residues, alters the fruit taste and results in health hazards for consumers and packhouse workers. This review summarises {{the latest developments in}} alternative treatments to replace sulphur dioxide fumigation in the litchi postharvest managemen...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{known that the}} {{addition}} of condensed silica fume to a concrete mix would improve the cohesiveness and hence segregation stability. However, quite often, this would also impair the flowability. To study the overall effects of condensed silica fume, an experimental programme was launched, whereby 45 mortar samples with different condensed silica fume contents and water/solid ratios, each representing the mortar portion of a concrete mix, were tested for their rheological properties, cohesiveness <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> densities. Their rheological properties were {{measured in terms of}} flow spread, flow rate, yield stress and apparent viscosity, while their cohesiveness <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> densities were measured using the <b>sieve</b> segregation <b>and</b> wet <b>packing</b> tests respectively. It was found that the effect of condensed silica fume on flowability could be positive or negative, depending on the water/solid ratio, and when the water/solid ratio is low, the addition of condensed silica fume would improve the flowability by increasing the packing density. It was also found that the effect of condensed silica fume on cohesiveness is always positive. Put together, the overall flowability-cohesiveness performance would be improved by the addition of condensed silica fume. Thomas Telford Ltd © 2011. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
