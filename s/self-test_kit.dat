40|$|Abstract Background Cancer-related self-tests are {{currently}} available {{to buy in}} pharmacies or over the internet, including tests for faecal occult blood, PSA and haematuria. Self-tests have potential benefits (e. g. convenience) {{but there are also}} potential harms (e. g. delays in seeking treatment). The extent of cancer-related self-test use in the UK is not known. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of cancer-related self-test use. Methods Adults (n = 5, 545) in the West Midlands were sent a questionnaire that collected socio-demographic information and data regarding previous and potential future use of 18 different self-tests. Prevalence rates were directly standardised to the England population. The postcode based Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004 was used as a proxy measure of deprivation. Results 2, 925 (54 %) usable questionnaires were returned. 1. 2 % (95 % CI 0. 83 % to 1. 66 %) of responders reported having used a cancer related self test kit and a further 36 % reported that they would consider using one in the future. Logistic regression analyses suggest that increasing age, deprivation category and employment status were associated with cancer-related <b>self-test</b> <b>kit</b> use. Conclusion We conclude that one in 100 of the adult population have used a cancer-related <b>self-test</b> <b>kit</b> and over a third would consider using one in the future. <b>Self-test</b> <b>kit</b> use could alter perceptions of risk, cause psychological morbidity and impact on the demand for healthcare. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Coronary {{heart disease}} {{patients}} {{have to learn}} to manage their condition to maximise quality of life and prevent recurrence or deterioration. They may develop their own informal methods of self-management in addition to the advice they receive as part of formal cardiac rehabilitation programmes. This study aimed to explore the use of complementary and alternative medicines and therapies (CAM), self-test kits and attitudes towards health of UK patients one year after referral to cardiac rehabilitation. Method Questionnaire given to 463 patients attending an assessment clinic for 12 month follow up in four West Midlands hospitals. Results 91. 1 % completed a questionnaire. 29. 1 % of patients used CAM and/or self-test kits for self-management but few (8. 9 %) used both methods. CAM was more often used for treating other illnesses than for CHD management. <b>Self-test</b> <b>kit</b> use (77. 2 %,) was more common than CAM (31. 7 %,) with BP monitors being the most prevalent (80. 0 %). Patients obtained self-test kits {{from a wide range of}} sources, for the most part (89. 5 %) purchased entirely on their own initiative. Predictors of self-management were post revascularisation status and higher scores on 'holism', 'rejection of authority' and 'individual responsibility'. Predictors of <b>self-test</b> <b>kit</b> use were higher 'holism' and 'individual responsibility' scores. Conclusion Patients are independently using new technologies to monitor their cardiovascular health, a role formerly carried out only by healthcare practitioners. Post-rehabilitation patients reported using CAM for self-management less frequently than they reported using self-test kits. Reports of CAM use were less frequent than in previous surveys of similar patient groups. Automatic assumptions cannot be made by clinicians about which CHD patients are most likely to self-manage. In order to increase trust and compliance it is important for doctors to encourage all CHD patients to disclose their self-management practices and to continue to address this in follow up consultations. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Shortly {{after the}} {{approval}} of an over-the-counter HIV self-test in the US, we conducted a study to estimate the proportion of {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) in Spain who knew that unauthorized HIV self-tests could be purchased online, and the proportion that had already used these tests, as well as their socio-demographic and behavioural correlates. Methods Between September 2012 and February 2013, MSM users of gay dating websites were invited to complete an online questionnaire. We calculated estimates of the knowledge and use of unauthorized HIV self-testing and assessed the associated factors by rare event logit regression models. Results Among 8620 participants, 4. 2  % (95 % CI: 3. 8 – 4. 6) knew they could buy an unauthorized HIV <b>self-test</b> <b>kit</b> online, and 12. 7  % (95 % CI: 12. 0 – 13. 4) thought that such a test might exist, although they had never seen one. Only 0. 7  % (95 % CI: 0. 5 – 0. 9) had ever self-tested. In the multivariable analysis, knowledge of online availability of self-tests was associated with being a non-Latin American foreigner, having at least two previous HIV tests, intending to test for HIV in the next year, and knowing about U. S. approval of self-testing. Ever-use of HIV self-testing was associated with being over 34  years of age, living outside Spain during the last 12  months, and knowing about U. S. approval of self-testing. Conclusions Both knowledge and use of unauthorized HIV self-testing among MSM in Spain was very low among HIV negative or untested MSM in Spain. The recent approval in the United Kingdom and France might increase the number of MSM seeking such testing and possibly using unauthorized test kits not meeting quality standards...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Time of {{ovulation}} as {{detected by}} a self-test of luteinizing hormone (LH) {{in the urine}} was compared with time of ovulation as detected by self-observation of cervical mucus. Twenty regularly cycling women monitored their cervical mucus and urine LH for two complete menstrual cycles. Of the cycles that had an LH surge, 100 % were on the peak day of cervical mucus or within {{three days before the}} peak day. Self-observation of cervical mucus, therefore, can be an accurate method of determining optimal fertility. In recent years, a number of diagnostic <b>self-test</b> <b>kits</b> have been developed to help women detect their times of ovulation. 1 The majority of these self-tests of ovulation are based on the detection of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine. According to the World Health Organization, a surge in LH levels takes place about 16 hours before ovulation in the serum and about 6 hours later in the urine. 2 The amount of LH in the serum or urine is detected by enzyme immunoassay of monoclonal antibodies. Urine LH <b>self-test</b> <b>kits</b> are used by women who want to time intercourse more precisely to become pregnant, often because they suffer from infertility problems. These ovulation detection <b>self-test</b> <b>kits</b> should not be used by women who wish to avoid pregnancy because such tests do not give an adequate warning time as to when ovulatio...|$|R
40|$|In {{the era of}} ambitious HIV targets, novel HIV testing {{models are}} {{required}} for hard-to-reach groups such as men, who remain underserved by existing services. Pregnancy presents a unique opportunity for partners to test for HIV, as many pregnant women will attend antenatal care (ANC). We describe the views of pregnant women and their male partners on HIV <b>self-test</b> <b>kits</b> that are woman-delivered, alone or with an additional intervention. A formative qualitative study to inform {{the design of a}} multi-arm multi-stage cluster-randomized trial, comprised of six focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews, was conducted. ANC attendees were purposively sampled on the day of initial clinic visit, while men were recruited after obtaining their contact information from their female partners. Data were analysed using content analysis, and our interpretation is hypothetical as participants were not offered <b>self-test</b> <b>kits.</b> Providing HIV <b>self-test</b> <b>kits</b> to pregnant women to deliver to their male partners was highly acceptable to both women and men. Men preferred this approach compared with standard facility-based testing, as self-testing fits into their lifestyles which were characterized by extreme day-to-day economic pressures, including the need to raise money for food for their household daily. Men and women emphasized the need for careful communication before and after collection of the <b>self-test</b> <b>kits</b> in order to minimize the potential for intimate partner violence although physical violence was perceived as less likely to occur. Most men stated a preference to first self-test alone, followed by testing as a couple. Regarding interventions for optimizing linkage following self-testing, both men and women felt that a fixed financial incentive of approximately USD$ 2 would increase linkage. However, there were concerns that financial incentives of greater value may lead to multiple pregnancies and lack of child spacing. In this low-income setting, a lottery incentive was considered overly disappointing for those who receive nothing. Phone call reminders were preferred to short messaging service. Woman-delivered HIV self-testing through ANC was acceptable to pregnant women and their male partners. Feedback on additional linkage enablers will be used to alter pre-planned trial arms...|$|R
40|$|Although HIV {{self-testing}} (HIVST) is globally {{accepted as}} an important complement to existing HIV testing approaches, South Africa has lagged behind in its adoption. As a result, data on the acceptability and uptake of HIVST testing is limited. The study investigated the acceptability of HIVST among students in Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges in two provinces in South Africa. A cross-sectional survey using a self-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect data among 3, 662 students recruited from 13 TVET colleges. The {{mean age of the}} students was 21. 9 years. The majority (80. 9 %) were sexually active; while 66. 1 % reported that they had one sexual partner, and 33. 9 % had two or more sexual partners in the past year, and 66. 5 % used condoms during the last sexual act. Three-quarters tested for HIV in the past year but less than half knew about HIVST prior to the survey. The acceptability of HIVST was high; about three-quarters showed a willingness to purchase a <b>self-test</b> <b>kit</b> and a majority would self-test with partners. Acceptability of HIVST was associated with being sexually active (OR = 1. 73, p = 0. 02, confidence interval (CI) : 1. 08 - 2. 75), having ever been tested for HIV (OR = 1. 74, p = 0. 001, CI: 1. 26 - 2. 38), and having multiple sexual partners (OR = 0. 61, p = 0. 01, CI: 0. 42 - 0. 88). Three-quarters would confirm test results at a local health facility. In terms of counselling, telephone hotlines were acceptable to only 39. 9 %, and less than half felt that test-kit leaflets would provide sufficient information to self-test. The high acceptability of HIVST among the students calls for extensive planning and preparation for the scaling up of HIVST in South Africa. In addition, campaigns similar to those conducted to promote HIV counselling and testing (HCT) should be considered to educate communities about HIVST...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background As {{there is}} no {{specific}} treatment for dengue, early detection and access to proper treatment may lower dengue fatality. Therefore, having new techniques for the early detection of dengue fever, {{such as the use}} of dengue test kit, is vitally important. The aims of the study were: 1) identify factors associated with acceptance of a home <b>self-test</b> <b>kit</b> for dengue fever if the dengue test is available to the public and 2) find out the characteristics of the test kits that influence the use of the dengue test kit. Methods A national telephone survey was carried out with 2, 512 individuals of the Malaysian public aged 18 – 60 years old. Individuals were contacted by random digit dialling covering the whole of Malaysia from February 2012 to June 2013. Results From 2, 512 participants, 6. 1  % reported to have heard of the availability of the dengue home test kit and of these, 44. 8  % expressed their intention to use the test kit if it was available. Multivariate logistic regressions indicated that participants with primary (OR: 0. 65; 95  % CI: 0. 43 – 0. 89; p[*]=[*] 0. 02, vs. tertiary educational level) and secondary educational levels (OR: 0. 73; 95  % CI: 0. 57 – 0. 90; p[*]=[*] 0. 01, vs. tertiary educational level) were less likely than participants with a tertiary educational level to use a home self-testing dengue kit for dengue if the kit was available. Participants with lower perceived barriers to dengue prevention (level of barriers 0 – 5) were less likely (OR: 0. 67, 95  % CI: 0. 53 – 0. 85, p[*]<[*] 0. 001, vs. higher perceived barriers) to use a home self-testing dengue kit for dengue if the kit was available compared to those with higher perceived barriers to dengue prevention (level of barriers 6 - 10). Participants with a lower total dengue fever knowledge score (range 0 – 22) were also less likely to use a home self-testing dengue kit for dengue if the kit was available (OR: 0. 75; 95  % CI: 0. 61 – 0. 91, p[*]=[*] 0. 001, vs. higher total dengue fever knowledge score) compared to those with a higher total dengue fever knowledge score (range 23 – 44). With response to characteristics of the test kit, participants indicated that ease of usability and easy to understand instructions were the most important factors influencing the decision to use the dengue home test kit; this was followed by the price of the test kit. Conclusions The study highlights the need for provision of information to increase knowledge about the home self-testing dengue kit. Educational interventions should target people with low educational levels, those with lower dengue fever knowledge and those with lower perceived barriers to dengue prevention...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{large-scale}} {{efforts to}} diagnose {{people living with}} HIV, 54 % remain undiagnosed in sub-Saharan Africa. The gap in knowledge of HIV status and uptake of follow-on services remains wide with much lower rates of HIV testing among men compared to women. Here, we design a study to investigate the effect on uptake of HIV testing and linkage into care or prevention of partner-delivered HIV self-testing alone or with an additional intervention among male partners of pregnant women. A phase II, adaptive, multi-arm, multi-stage cluster randomised trial, randomising antenatal clinic (ANC) days to six different trial arms. Pregnant women accessing ANC in urban Malawi {{for the first time}} will be recruited into either the standard of care (SOC) arm (invitation letter to the male partner offering HIV testing) or one of five intervention arms offering oral HIV <b>self-test</b> <b>kits.</b> Three of the five intervention arms will additionally offer the male partner a financial incentive (fixed or lottery amount) conditional on linkage after self-testing with one arm testing phone call reminders. Assuming that 25 % of male partners link to care or prevention in the SOC arm, six clinic days, with a harmonic mean of 21 eligible participants, per arm will provide 80 % power to detect a 0. 15 absolute difference in the primary outcome. Cluster proportions will be analysed by a cluster summaries approach with adjustment for clustering and multiplicity. This trial applies adaptive methods which are novel and efficient designs. The methodology and lessons learned here will be important as proof of concept of how to design and conduct similar studies in the future. Although small, this trial will potentially present good evidence on the type of effective interventions for improving linkage into ART or prevention. The trial results will also have important policy implications on how to implement HIVST targeting male partners of pregnant women who are accessing ANC for the first time while paying particular attention to safety concerns. Contamination may occur if women in the intervention arms share their <b>self-test</b> <b>kits</b> with women in the SOC arm. ISRCTN, ID: 18421340. Registered on 31 March 2016...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: HIV {{testing is}} key to the {{delivery}} of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) : testing HIV-uninfected at-risk persons is the first step for PrEP initiation and ongoing HIV testing {{is an essential part of}} PrEP delivery. Thus, novel and cost-effective HIV-testing approaches to streamline delivery of PrEP are urgently needed. Within a demonstration project of PrEP for HIV prevention among high-risk HIV serodiscordant couples in Kenya (the Partners Demonstration Project), we conducted a pilot evaluation of HIV self-testing. Methods: Clinic visits were scheduled quarterly and included in-clinic HIV testing using fingerstick rapid HIV tests and refills of PrEP prescriptions. HIV oral fluid <b>self-test</b> <b>kits</b> were provided for participants to use in the two-month interval between scheduled quarterly clinic visits. Acceptability of HIV self-testing was assessed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Results: We found that 222 of 226 (98 %) HIV-uninfected persons who were offered accepted self-testing. Nearly all (96. 8 %) reported that using the self-testing kit was easy. More than half (54. 5 %) reportedly did not share the HIV results from self-testing with anyone and almost all (98. 7 %) the participants did not share the HIV self-testing kits with anyone. Many participants reported that HIV self-testing was empowering and reduced anxiety associated with waiting between clinic HIV tests. Conclusions: HIV self-testing was highly acceptable and may therefore be a feasible strategy to efficiently permit routine HIV testing between PrEP refills...|$|R

Self-testing for HIV has garnered controversy for years and the debate reignited {{with the approval of}} a point-of-care test for over-the-counter sale in the US in 2012. Here, we present arguments for and against HIV self-testing. The case in support of HIV self-testing contends that: the modality is highly acceptable, especially among the most at-risk individuals; self-testing empowers users, thus helping to normalize testing; and mutual partner testing has the potential to increase awareness of risk and avert condomless sex between discordant partners. Arguments against HIV self-testing include: cost limits access to those who need testing most; false-negative results, especially during the window period, may lead to false reassurance and could promote sex between discordant partners at the time of highest infectivity; opportunities for counseling, linkage to care, and diagnosis of other sexually transmitted infections may be missed; and self-testing leads to potential for coercion between partners. Research is needed to better define the risks of self-testing, especially as performance of the assays improves, and to delineate the benefits of programs designed to improve access to <b>self-test</b> <b>kits,</b> because this testing modality has numerous potential advantages and drawbacks.

40|$|Although HIV {{testing and}} {{counseling}} (HTC) uptake {{has increased dramatically}} in Africa, facility-based services are unlikely to ever meet ongoing need to the full. A major constraint in scaling up community and home-based HTC services is the unacceptability of receiving HTC from a provider known personally to prospective clients. We investigated the potential of supervised oral HIV self-testing from this perspective. Adult members of 60 households and 72 members of community peer groups in urban Blantyre, Malawi, were selected using population-weighted random cluster sampling. Participants were offered self-testing plus confirmatory HTC (parallel testing with two rapid finger-prick blood tests), standard HTC alone, or no testing. 283 (95. 6 %) of 298 selected adults participated, including 136 (48. 0 %) men. 175 (61. 8 %) had previously tested (19 known HIV positive), although only 64 (21. 5 %) within the last year. HIV prevalence was 18. 5 %. Among 260 (91. 9 %) who opted to self-test after brief demonstration and illustrated instructions, accuracy was 99. 2 % (two false negatives). Although 98. 5 % rated the test "not hard at all to do," 10. 0 % made minor procedural errors, and 10. 0 % required extra help. Most participants indicated willingness to accept <b>self-test</b> <b>kits,</b> but not HTC, from a neighbor (acceptability 94. 5 % versus 46. 8 %, p =  0. 001). Oral supervised self-testing was highly acceptable and accurate, although minor errors and need for supervisory support were common. This novel option has potential for high uptake at local community level {{if it can be}} supervised and safely linked to counseling and care...|$|R
40|$|In Cambodia, HIV {{prevalence}} is high while HIV testing rates remain low among transgender women (TG women), men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM), and female entertainment workers (FEW). Introducing self-testing for HIV to these key populations (KPs) could potentially overcome the under-diagnosis of HIV and significantly increase testing rates and receipt of the results, and thus could decrease transmission. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the acceptability of HIV self-testing (HIVST) among these three categories of KPs. This study was conducted through focus group discussions (FGDs) with TG women, MSM, and FEW in Phnom Penh city, Kampong Cham, Battambang, and Siem Reap provinces of Cambodia. Convenience sampling was used to recruit the participants. Two FGDs (six participants in each FGD) were conducted in each target group in each study site, totaling 24 FGDs (144 participants). Thematic analysis was performed to identify common or divergent patterns across the target groups. Almost all participants among the three groups (TG women, MSM, and FEW) had not heard about HIVST, but all of them expressed willingness to try it. They perceived HIVST as confidential, convenient, time-saving, and high-tech. Barriers to obtaining HIVST included cost, access, administration technique, embarrassment, and fear of pain. The majority preferred counseling before and after testing. Participants showed high willingness to use and acceptability of HIVST due to its confidentiality/privacy and convenience even if it is not linked to a confirmatory test or care and treatment. Notwithstanding, to increase HIVST, the target groups would need affordable <b>self-test</b> <b>kits,</b> education about how to perform HIVST and read results, assurance about accuracy and reliability of HIVST, and provision of post-test counseling and facilitation of linkage to care and treatment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Self-tests {{are those}} where an {{individual}} can obtain a result without recourse to a health professional, by getting a result immediately or by sending a sample to a laboratory that returns the result directly. Self-tests can be diagnostic, for disease monitoring, or both. There are currently tests for more than 20 different conditions available to the UK public, and self-testing is marketed {{as a way of}} alerting people to serious health problems so they can seek medical help. Almost nothing is known {{about the extent to which}} people self-test for cancer or why they do this. Self-tests for cancer could alter perceptions of risk and health behaviour, cause psychological morbidity and have a significant impact on the demand for healthcare. This study aims to gain an understanding of the frequency of self-testing for cancer and characteristics of users. Methods Cross-sectional survey. Adults registered in participating general practices in the West Midlands Region, will be asked to complete a questionnaire that will collect socio-demographic information and basic data regarding previous and potential future use of <b>self-test</b> <b>kits.</b> The only exclusions will be people who the GP feels it would be inappropriate to send a questionnaire, for example because they are unable to give informed consent. Freepost envelopes will be included and non-responders will receive one reminder. Standardised prevalence rates will be estimated. Discussion Cancer related self-tests, currently available from pharmacies or over the Internet, include faecal occult blood tests (related to bowel cancer), prostate specific antigen tests (related to prostate cancer), breast cancer kits (self examination guide) and haematuria tests (related to urinary tract cancers). The effect of an increase in self-testing for cancer is unknown but may be considerable: it may affect the delivery of population based screening programmes; empower patients or cause unnecessary anxiety; reduce costs on existing healthcare services or increase demand to investigate patients with positive test results.

Methods Our study adopts an empirical ethics approach, supplementing an initial review into the ethical considerations posed by such technologies with qualitative data from three focus groups. Results Overall, we map a range of possible considerations both for and {{against the use of}} such technologies, synthesizing evidence from a range of secondary literature, as well as identifying several new considerations previously overlooked. Conclusions We argue that no single consideration marks these technologies as either entirely permissible or impermissible but rather tools which have the potential to incur certain costs and benefits, and that context is important in determining these. In the latter stages of the article, we explain how developers of such technologies might seek to mitigate such costs and reflect on the possible limitations of the empirical ethics method brought out during the study...|$|R
