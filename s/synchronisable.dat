5000|$|Oktophonie was {{realised}} in the Studio for Electronic Music of the Westdeutscher Rundfunk, Cologne, in {{two phases}} of work: from 23 August to 30 November 1990, and from 5 to 30 August 1991. Studio collaborators were recording engineers Volker Müller and Daniel Velasco-Schwarzenberger, and recording technician Gertrud Melcher ( [...] ; [...] ). Production was made using a single 24-track tape recorder. A 64-track recorder {{would have been}} preferable, or alternatively three <b>synchronisable</b> 24-track recorders, but the WDR studio had only the one machine. Spatialisation was facilitated {{by the use of}} a QUEG (Quadrophonic Effect Generator), a device manufactured by EMS in the early 1970s. It was developed by Stockhausen in collaboration with Peter Zinovieff, owner of the firm at that time. Despite having only four outputs, the QUEG could still be used to produce an octophonic output, by manually switching to four outputs, not only between the square on the floor and the one on the ceiling, but between all six squares forming the sides of the cube [...] A number of synthesizers and modules were used in the production of the sound layers : ...|$|E
40|$|A Tesla coil {{generator}} {{was designed}} to produce high voltage pulses oscillating at 100 kHz <b>synchronisable</b> with a nanosecond temporal jitter. Using this compact high voltage generator we demonstrate reproducible meter long discharges in air at a repetition rate of 1 Hz. Triggering and guiding of the discharges are performed in air by femtosecond laser filaments...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{responsivity}} {{of the human brain}} at different rates of sensory stimulation has provided several pieces of information on brain functionality. The new analysis technique used in this study permits us to investigate the dynamics of these responses and to obtain a larger amount of statistical data to allow for fine frequency discrimination. This allows us to suggest, for example, phase locked systems as models for <b>synchronisable</b> spontaneous activity. Absence of subject fatigue during the repetition of the stimulation paradigm, as well as the presence of a 'learning period' characterised by transient dynamics of the responses, are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Modelling {{freehand}} {{writing in}} all its capacitive expressiveness and stylised apotheosis for the enhanced support of the e-learning industry is highlighted in this paper. The trend of moving towards natural environments in the digital world encourages freehand writing to be the bridging tool that encompasses portable and <b>synchronisable</b> standards of manipulating ink data. Our proposals of utilising ink in its primitive format extend to include the bases for creating, presenting, capturing, and replaying ink data {{in a manner that}} describes the dynamics of freehand writings as natural parameters that can induce random real-time access. The requirements of which were derived from observing practical scenarios, and forming them as desirable constraints for maximisation. Our examination of the various ink data formats currently available, led us to believe that W 3 C’s InkML standard contains the necessary sustenance for both simple and elaborate data layouts that can be adapted for our software prototypes, as well as on other developed systems. This reason of compatibility in context attributes is what we find important for a uniform framework of a solid database structure of handling digital ink. 1...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{documents}} a body {{of research}} that links the field of electro-acoustic diffusion and spatialisation with practice in the music and film post-production industries. Three research questions are posed: "How can the physical user-interfaces used for panning by the music and film post-production industries offer creative alternatives to the fader-based hardware approach commonly used for electro-acoustic performance?" "How can a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) be used as an alternative to dedicated panning hardware? "How can emerging programming technologies offer creative alternatives to the MAX/MSP or hardware-based tools commonly used for sound spatialisation?" This practice-based PhD addresses these questions by designing, developing and testing a set of hardware and software tools, the Requirement Specification for this `Toolset' results from literature review and critical analysis of current systems to determine potential research gaps. This analysis is followed by the selection of a suitable methodology for development and testing that allows the research questions to be explored effectively and results in the following Toolset: OctoPanner: Amulti-featured eight-channel 3 D touchscreen panner application for Apple's Mac OS X controlling a DAW hosted customisable VST 3 D panning plug-in with C++ source code. ShapePanner: A <b>synchronisable</b> shape-based sequencer application for Mac OS X inspired by Experimentalstudio's Halaphon. The user is ab{e to describe the movement of sounds in a 3 D space using shape primitives such as lines and circles and thus extend the capabilities of the Toolset beyond realtime manual manipulation of sounds. 3 DMIDIVisualiser: An application to allow the user to work without access to a multi-speaker system by enabling the movement of sounds to be viewed within a virtual room. Foot Puck: Afoot-controlled panning controller enabling a musician to spatialise their instrument using foot movement. Initial prototyping was achieved using Cycling ` 74 's Max/MSP but the final applications are written using Apple's Cocoa environment and Objective C. This thesis gives close analysis and discussion of the various stages of research carried out; including the use of Apple's CoreMlDl and CoreAudio Clock OS X Core Services in a Cocoa application.
