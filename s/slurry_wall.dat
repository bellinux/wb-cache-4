40|$|Soil-Cement-Bentonite (SCB) <b>slurry</b> <b>walls</b> {{have been}} used with {{increasing}} frequency {{in recent years to}} provide barriers to the lateral flow of groundwater in situations where the strength of a normal soil-bentonite wall would be inadequate to carry foundation loads. The addition of cement to the backfill blend allows the backfill to set and form a more rigid system that can support greater overlying loads. Construction and quality control for the SCB wall is more demanding than that needed for conventional soil-bentonite <b>slurry</b> <b>walls.</b> Backfill mixing, sampling and testing of this type of wall involve more exacting procedures. Recommendations are made herein for methods to carry out pre-job design mix testing and in-field quality control testing for the most reliable results.

500|$|Groundbreaking was on August 5, 1966, {{marking the}} {{beginning}} of construction of the World Trade Center's foundations. [...] The site of the World Trade Center was located on landfill, with the bedrock located [...] below grade. In order to construct the World Trade Center, {{it was necessary to}} build [...] "The Bathtub", with the <b>slurry</b> <b>wall</b> along the West Street side of the site, to keep water from the Hudson River out. [...] This method was used in place of conventional dewatering methods because lowering the groundwater table would cause large settlements of nearby buildings not built on deep foundations. [...] The slurry method involves digging a trench, and as excavation proceeds, filling the space with a [...] "slurry" [...] mixture, composed of bentonite which plugs holes and keeps water out. [...] When the trench was dug out, a steel cage was inserted, with concrete poured in, forcing the [...] "slurry" [...] out. [...] The [...] "slurry" [...] method was devised by Port Authority chief engineer John M. Kyle Jr. [...] Towards the end of 1966, work began on building the <b>slurry</b> <b>wall,</b> led by Montreal-based Icanda, a subsidiary of an Italian engineering firm, Impresa Costruzioni Opere Specializzate (I.C.O.S.). [...] It took fourteen months for the <b>slurry</b> <b>wall</b> to be completed, which was necessary before excavation of material from the interior of the site could begin. [...] The original Hudson Tubes, which carried PATH trains into Hudson Terminal, remained in service as elevated tunnels until 1971 when a new PATH station was built.|$|E
500|$|The towers were {{designed}} as framed tube structures, which provided tenants with open floor plans, uninterrupted by columns or walls. [...] This was accomplished using numerous closely spaced perimeter columns to provide {{much of the}} strength to the structure, along with gravity load shared with the core columns. [...] The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space to be freed up for use as office space by making the structural core smaller.

500|$|Repairs to {{structural}} elements {{on the lower}} levels of 1 WTC were made following the 1993 bombing. The greatest damage occurred on levels B1 and B2, with significant structural damage also on level B3. [...] Primary structural columns were not damaged, but secondary steel members experienced some damage. Floors that were blown out needed to be repaired to restore the structural support they provided to columns. The <b>slurry</b> <b>wall</b> was in peril following the bombing and loss of the floor slabs which provided lateral support to counteract pressure from Hudson River water on the other side. [...] The refrigeration plant on sublevel B5, which provided air conditioning to the entire World Trade Center complex, was heavily damaged and replaced with a temporary system for the summer of 1993. [...] The fire alarm system for the entire complex needed to be replaced, after critical wiring and signaling in the original system was destroyed in the 1993 bombing. Installation of the new system took years to complete, and replacement of some components was still underway in September 2001.|$|E

2500|$|Groundbreaking on the World Trade Center {{took place}} in 1966. The site was on land fill, with bedrock located [...] below the surface. A new method was used to {{construct}} a <b>slurry</b> <b>wall</b> to keep out water from the Hudson River. During excavation of the site and construction of the towers, the original Hudson Tubes remained in service as elevated tunnels. The Hudson Terminal was shut down in 1971 when a new Port Authority Trans-Hudson, or PATH Railroad station was completed. The new station cost $35 million to build. At the time, it had a passenger volume of 85,000 daily.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Slurry</b> <b>walls</b> are {{successively}} {{extended to}} enclose an area, blocking water and softened earth from flowing into it. Once the concrete has hardened, excavation within the now concrete-wall-enclosed area can proceed. To prevent the concrete wall from collapsing into the newly open area, temporary supports such as tiebacks or internal crossbeams are installed. When completed, the structure built within the walled-off area supports the wall, so that tiebacks or other temporary bracing may be removed.|$|R
2500|$|Smith {{employed}} numerous revolutionary architectural techniques while {{building the}} stadium. At {{the base is}} a <b>slurry</b> <b>wall</b> {{to keep out the}} waters from the Olentangy River; the stadium sets on the flood plain. Instead of building a large bowl like the previously constructed Yale Bowl, Ohio Stadium was designed to have an upper deck that would hang over part of the lower deck, giving Ohio Stadium its [...] "A", [...] "B", and [...] "C" [...] decks. Instead of employing numerous columns like those at Harvard Stadium, Smith designed double columns that allow for more space between columns. The rotunda {{at the north end of}} the stadium, which is now adorned with stained glass murals of the offensive and defensive squads that comprise the Buckeye football team, was designed to look like the dome at the Pantheon in Rome.|$|E

One of the museum's walls is an exposed side of the <b>slurry</b> <b>wall</b> retaining the Hudson River, which remained intact during (and after) September 11. Other Ground Zero artifacts include wrecked emergency vehicles (including a fire engine deformed from the collapse), pieces of metal from all seven World Trade Center buildings, recordings of survivors and first responders (including 911 phone calls), pictures of all victims, photographs from the wreckage and other media detailing the destruction (including the crashes, collapse, fires, those who jumped and the cleanup). The museum is designed to evoke memories without additional distress, particularly to first responders and the families of victims.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation {{launched}} the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition, an international competition {{to design a}} memorial at the World Trade Center site to commemorate the lives lost on 9/11. Individuals and teams {{from around the world}} submitted design proposals. On November 19, 2003, the thirteen-member jury selected eight finalists. Reflecting Absence, designed by Michael Arad and Peter Walker, was chosen as the winning design on January 6, 2004. It consists of a field of trees interrupted by two large, recessed pools, the footprints of the Twin Towers. The deciduous trees (swamp white oaks) are arranged in rows and form informal clusters, clearings and groves. The park is at street level, above the Memorial Museum. The names of the victims of the attacks (including those from the Pentagon, American Airlines Flight 77, United Airlines Flight 93, and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing) are inscribed on the parapets surrounding the waterfalls in an arrangement of [...] "meaningful adjacencies". A portion of the <b>slurry</b> <b>wall</b> originally designed to hold back the Hudson River, about half of what Daniel Libeskind originally wanted to preserve, is maintained in the museum.

2500|$|As time passed, minor {{adjustments}} raised the seating capacity {{to more than}} 90,000. In 1984, a new $2.1 million scoreboard was installed. The stadium was heavily renovated from 1998 to 2001. The press box was replaced, additional seating was installed, and 81 luxury suites and 2,500 club seats were added. [...] The south end zone scoreboard was also replaced by a 90ft. x 30ft. video board that is able to show replays, highlights, animations, graphics and statistical information. Additionally, a smaller version of the south end scoreboard {{was added to the}} north end and a new LED ribbon board that runs end-zone to end-zone was added to the balcony prior to the 2009 season. [...] In 1998, the track was removed and a [...] <b>slurry</b> <b>wall</b> was built underneath the field to allow it to be lowered , which places it below the water table. After the 1999 season, the field of play was lowered to add seating closer to the field. The temporary bleachers in the south end zone were replaced with permanent seating. However, {{the south end of the}} stadium remains partially open, thus allowing the stadium to maintain its notable horseshoe configuration. General improvements were made in the seating and concourse areas. The result of the $194 million renovation was a capacity that rose to 101,568. 80% of the cost of the renovation was funded by the sale of leases on the suites and club seats, with the remaining 20% funded by donations and the sale of naming rights for portions of the stadium.

In this study, numerical simulation was applied for remediation planning at the site based {{on the concept of}} Verified Follow Up (VF-UP) that had been proposed as a new approach to complete remediation effectively with consideration of future risks. The amount of waste to be removed and pumping plans were discussed by numerical simulation to achieve the remedial objective in which 1, 4 -dioxane in groundwater outside of walls is remedied within 10 years and 1, 4 -dioxane spreading throughout the walls is prevented in the case where a portion of waste is remained. Firstly, the amount of waste to be removed considering pumping plans for P&T was determined by scenario analysis. As a result, at least two-third of waste should be removed by combining with P&T. However, if the waste is remained, future risks of 1, 4 -dioxane spreading through the <b>slurry</b> <b>walls</b> may occur. Our simulation suggested that groundwater within the remaining waste must be pumped up at least 20 m 3 /d for containment of 1, 4 -dioxane within the remaining waste.
