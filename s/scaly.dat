5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of psoriasis is usually {{based on the}} appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for psoriasis are <b>scaly,</b> erythematous plaques, papules, or patches of skin that may be painful and itch. No special blood tests or diagnostic procedures are needed to make the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|From 1998, I {{started coming}} across people {{who told me}} they had seen people change into a {{non-human}} form. It's an age-old phenomenon known as shape-shifting. The basic form is like a <b>scaly</b> humanoid, with reptilian rather than humanoid eyes.|$|E
5|$|Guttate {{psoriasis}} {{is characterized}} by numerous small, <b>scaly,</b> red or pink, droplet-like lesions (papules). These numerous spots of psoriasis appear over {{large areas of the}} body, primarily the trunk, but also the limbs and scalp. Guttate psoriasis is often triggered by a streptococcal infection, typically streptococcal pharyngitis. The reverse is not true.|$|E

50|$|This is a medium-large tern, with a long, slender orange bill, pale grey upperparts {{and white}} underparts. Its legs are black. In winter, the {{forehead}} becomes white. Juvenile elegant terns have a <b>scalier</b> pale grey back. The call is a characteristic loud grating noise like a Sandwich tern.|$|R
500|$|A larger {{variety of}} the {{mushroom}} {{has been described by}} Zeller, A.deserticola var. major (originally Longula texensis var. major), whose range overlaps that of the typical variety.

5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire through {{the top of their}} skin. This is unusual for reptiles, because their skin is thick and <b>scaly,</b> but {{experiments}} with the black-and-yellow sea snake, Pelamis platura (a pelagic species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is a {{long-lasting}} {{autoimmune disease}} characterized by patches of abnormal skin. These skin patches are typically red, itchy, and <b>scaly.</b> Psoriasis varies in severity from small, localized patches to complete body coverage. Injury {{to the skin}} can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot, which {{is known as the}} Koebner phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus bitorquis, also edible, has {{a similar}} appearance, but can be {{distinguished}} by its double ring, {{and the lack of}} a fishy or briny odor. Additionally, A.bitorquis does not stain reddish when cut, and usually does not have a <b>scaly</b> or warty cap. The Hungarian species A.bernardiiformis, named for its similarity to A.bernardii, is distinguished from the latter by its smaller spores (6.2–8.2 by 5.4–6.2μm) and its club-shaped cheilocystidia that measure 17–35 by 7–9.5μm. MycoBank, however, considers the two species to be conspecific.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The effeel of {{shear lag}} on creep {{deformations}} and stress redistri-butions in concrete box girder bridges is analyzed both deterministically and stochastically. It is {{found that the}} shear lag is as important for creep {{as it is for}} elastic deformations. Compared to bending theory predictions. the shear lag causes a Significant increase in the maximum longitudinal normal stress, alters the stress redistributions due to a change in the structural system during the construction stage, and substantially increases the deflections. The statistical variability of material creep parameters and environmental factors has a sig-nificanl effecl on Ihe slatistical <b>scalier</b> of Ihe calculilled maximum I'>nsitudinal stresses and a very large effecl on Ihe slatistical <b>scalier</b> of the predicted de-flections. Both the shear lag e£fect and the st;ltistical variability of creep musl be taken into account if a reliable design of box girder bridges fwm the view-point of long-term serviceability should be achieved...|$|R

5|$|Bracken is {{very common}} in upland areas, Beech Fern in woods and other shaded {{locations}} and <b>Scaly</b> Male Fern in wooded or open areas. Wilsons Filmy-fern is a common upland variety in the Highlands, along with the Tunbridge Filmy-fern, Alpine Lady-fern and the rarer stunted form Newman’s Lady-fern (A. distentifolium var. flexile) which is endemic to Scotland. The Killarney Fern, once found on Arran {{was thought to be}} extinct in Scotland, but has been discovered on Skye in its gametophyte form.|$|E
5|$|Strobilomyces strobilaceus {{is roughly}} similar in {{appearance}} {{because of its}} rough <b>scaly</b> cap and lacerated margin, but may be distinguished from B.ananas by smooth stem without a ring, different spores, and flesh that is less tough. The Australian species Boletellus ananiceps has spores with narrow longitudinal ribs {{that do not have}} cross-striae. B.dissiliens has colors that are not red as in B.ananas, and pores that can become reddish in maturity. Further, the cap flesh of B.dissiliens turns blue upon exposure to air.|$|E
5|$|Sutorius eximius, {{commonly}} known as the lilac-brown bolete, is a species of fungus in the family Boletaceae. This bolete produces fruit bodies that are dark purple to chocolate brown in color with a smooth cap, a finely <b>scaly</b> stipe, and a reddish-brown spore print. The tiny pores on the cap underside are chocolate to violet brown. It is widely distributed, having been recorded on North America, South America, and Asia, where it grows in a mycorrhizal relationship with both coniferous and deciduous trees.|$|E
50|$|From {{a player}} perspective, Scavvies {{do not get}} anyone who carries heavy weapons and are not good at ranged attacks in general. On the other hand, the <b>Scalies</b> are the most {{powerful}} default close combat troops in the game, and they get a random number of disposable troops, such as plague zombies, for free each battle, providing them with targets that allow {{the rest of the}} gang to advance safely.|$|R
50|$|It {{is entirely}} dark {{except for a}} large white throat patch which is {{frequently}} visible from a distance. It is chunkier and browner than common swift, and the slightly paler flight feathers, underparts and rump give more contrast than that species. It also has a <b>scalier</b> looking belly and subtly different flight action. The call is a loud dry scream {{similar to that of}} its relative, though possibly more disyllabic.|$|R

5|$|The film {{required}} {{large and}} ambitious sets to be constructed, from the Shaft of Hands to the rambling, distorted Goblin City where the film's climactic battle takes place. The Shaft of Hands sequence was filmed on a rig that was roughly forty feet high, and required {{nearly a hundred}} performers to operate the grey, <b>scaly</b> hands integral to the scene. Connelly was strapped into a harness when shooting the scene, and would spend time between takes suspended midway up the shaft.|$|E
5|$|The irises of {{its eyes}} are red, its feet are black, and its beak is flesh-colored. The eye {{has a single}} {{incomplete}} row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid. Its beak is thick, rounded, and hooked at the tip. Because of its habit of urohidrosis, the <b>scaly</b> portions of its legs are often streaked white with uric acid.|$|E
5|$|The <b>scaly</b> {{juvenile}} plumage is retained until January or February of {{the year}} following hatching, when a lengthy moult of head and body feathers gives them a more adult-like appearance. Adults shed all their flight feathers simultaneously around this time, leaving them temporarily flightless, prior to gaining breeding plumage, but second-year birds delay this substantial moult until the summer. The adult winter plumage is attained between October and January by partial moult mainly of head, body and tail feathers.|$|E

50|$|Scavvies are humans with {{mutations}} {{too obvious}} to hide, banished from normal settlements. In Scavvie gangs, the very dregs of society scrape out an existence robbing guilder caravans, raiding isolated settlements and just generally scavenging {{whatever they can}} to survive. Their bands often include a stable sub-species of mutant, the giant reptilian <b>Scalies.</b> Scavvies have often been known to use bait to lure Plague zombies to attack rival gangs during their raids.|$|R
50|$|Males of this 22 cm thrush are conspicuously {{black and}} white. Mostly black {{on the upper}} parts it has a long white supercilium, and white tips to the wing coverts, tertials, rump and tail. The underparts are white with black flank spots the bill and legs are yellow. Females and young birds have the same basic pattern, but the black is {{replaced}} by dark brown, and the white by light brown. The markings on the underside are <b>scalier.</b>|$|R
5|$|Depending on the species, {{there are}} two to fifteen large showy flowers, which {{are more or less}} zygomophic and hermaphrodite. Each flower is 1320cm (5"8") across, and the native species are usually purple or red. They are funnelform (funnel shaped) and declinate (curving {{downwards}} and then upwards at the tip) in shape. The perianth has six brightly colored tepals (three outer sepals and three inner petals) that may be similar in appearance or very different. The perianth segments are subequal or unequal. The tepals are united at the base to form a short tube, usually with a rudimentary <b>scaly</b> paraperigonium with fimbriae or a callose ridge present at the throat.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{isolated}} coastal location, the Isle of Portland has {{an extensive}} range of flora and fauna; the coastline and disused quarries are designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Sea and migratory birds occupy the cliffs in different seasons, sometimes these include rare species which draw ornithologists {{from around the}} country. Rare visitors to the surrounding seas include dolphins, seals and basking sharks. Chesil Beach {{is one of only}} two sites in Britain where the <b>scaly</b> cricket can be found; unlike any other cricket it is wingless and does not sing or hop. Ten British Primitive goats were introduced to the East Weares part of the island to control scrub in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Tricholoma pardinum can be {{confused}} with T.nigrum and forms of T.virgatum that have more streaked rather than spotted caps. A form of T.pardinum in North America can be nearly white with pale scales, and may {{be confused}} with the whitish edible species T.resplendens. Microscopically, the presence of clamp connections sets T.pardinum apart from most other members of the genus, although the similar-looking (though more tan-coloured) T.venenatum also has them. According to Alexander H. Smith, T.huronense is closely related, but can be distinguished from T.pardinum by its narrower gills, its tendency to form drops of reddish liquid on the gills and stalk, and an ash-grey and <b>scaly</b> stalk surface.|$|E

50|$|Agaricus pocillator, a {{woodland}} mushroom, {{is distributed}} through southeastern North America in ranges {{at least as}} far north as Illinois. It can be distinguished in the field by its dark center, its small, bulbous base, which stains yellow, and its relatively slight stature. It is very similar to Agaricus placomyces, but is a slightly smaller mushroom with a <b>scalier</b> cap and a more northern range within the United States. Edibility is not certain for Agaricus pocillator, but several other yellow-staining Agaricus species are poisonous. Hikers are often warned to avoid eating it when spotted.|$|R
25|$|Lacoste was {{involved}} in a long-standing dispute over its logo with Hong Kong-based sportswear company Crocodile Garments. At the time, Lacoste used a crocodile logo that faced right (registered in France in 1933) while Crocodile used one that faced left (registered in various Asian countries in the 1940s and 1950s). Lacoste tried to block an application from Crocodile to register its logo in China during the 1990s, the dispute ending in a settlement. As part of the agreement, Crocodile agreed to change its logo, which now sports <b>scalier</b> skin, bigger eyes and a tail that rises vertically.|$|R
5|$|Necrid's {{alternate}} appearance differs heavily, {{and features}} <b>scaly,</b> reddish–orange skin. Additional differences include teal eyes, black pants, {{and a blue}} jewel. The protruding bones are isolated and bigger on his left shoulder and arm, and appear crystalline. A pauldron covering his right shoulder is fastened to the jewel's support harness, and the armor on his legs incorporate a pair of greaves. He wears a fauld on his abdomen, and bandages wrap around his stomach. A mask covers his face and is {{held in place by}} two straps around his head.|$|E
5|$|Turbinellus floccosus, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the shaggy, <b>scaly,</b> or woolly chanterelle, is a cantharelloid mushroom of the family Gomphaceae native to Asia and North America. It was known as Gomphus floccosus until 2011, when it {{was found to be}} only distantly related to the genus's type species, G.clavatus. It was consequently transferred from Gomphus to Turbinellus. The orange-capped vase- or trumpet-shaped fruiting bodies may reach 30cm (12in) high and 30cm (12in) wide. The lower surface, the hymenium, is covered in wrinkles and ridges rather than gills or pores, and is pale buff or yellowish to whitish.|$|E

50|$|The California quail (Callipepla californica), {{also known}} as the California valley quail or valley quail, is a small ground-dwelling bird in the New World quail family. These birds have a curving crest or plume, made of six feathers, that droops forward: black in males and brown in females; the flanks are brown with white streaks. Males have a dark brown cap and a black face with a brown back, a grey-blue chest and a light brown belly. Females and {{immature}} birds are mainly grey-brown with a light-colored belly.Their closest relative is Gambel's quail which has a more southerly distribution and, a longer crest at 2.5 in, a brighter head and a <b>scalier</b> appearance. The two species separated about 1-2 million years ago, during the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene. It is the state bird of California.|$|R
