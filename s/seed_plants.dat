5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to <b>seed</b> <b>plants</b> {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest <b>seed</b> <b>plants</b> by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds {{new light on the}} sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of <b>seed</b> <b>plants</b> except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E
5|$|Building {{upon the}} gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} that originated with Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through gametes. No other cells can pass on inherited characters. The work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy {{is still a}} major foundation of modern botany. Her books Plant Anatomy and Anatomy of <b>Seed</b> <b>Plants</b> have been key plant structural biology texts {{for more than half}} a century.|$|E
5|$|Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to {{strengthen}} the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels {{to keep them from}} collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of <b>seed</b> <b>plants</b> in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to {{study the effects of}} transplanting on growth and grain yield of three varieties of Sorghum bicolor, 'Ilorin local', SK 5912, and SSV 10. Seedlings from each variety transplanted at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after planting (WAP) were compared with directly <b>seeded</b> <b>plants</b> used as control. Results show that at 8 WAP with seedlings transplanted at 2 WAP were taller than the other transplants, but shorter than directly <b>seeded</b> <b>plants.</b> Transplanting caused delay in flowering, but at this stage, height of transplants was comparable to directly <b>seeded</b> <b>plants</b> in SK 5912 and SSV 10, while in 'Ilorin local' the transplants were significantly shorter at P< 0. 05. Dry matter accumulation and grain yield was comparable among transplants but lower than those of directly <b>seeded</b> <b>plants.</b> However, grain yield of seedlings that were transplanted at 2 WAP was statistically comparable with directly <b>seeded</b> <b>plants</b> at P< 0. 05...|$|R

5|$|During the Cambrian period, Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was {{partially}} in the Northern Hemisphere, and {{during this period}} large amounts of sandstones, limestones and shales were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor invertebrates and trilobites flourished in the tropical seas. By {{the start of the}} Devonian period (416Ma), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. Sand and silts were laid down in what is now the Ellsworth, Horlick and Pensacola Mountains. Glaciation began {{at the end of the}} Devonian period (360Ma), as Gondwana became centred on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though flora remained. During the Permian period, the land became dominated by <b>seed</b> <b>plants</b> such as Glossopteris, a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the Transantarctic Mountains. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.|$|E
25|$|Pollination is {{the process}} by which pollen is {{transferred}} to the female reproductive organs of a plant, thereby enabling fertilization to take place. Like all living organisms, <b>seed</b> <b>plants</b> have a single major purpose: to pass their genetic information on to the next generation. The reproductive unit is the seed, and pollination is an essential step in the production of seeds in all spermatophytes (<b>seed</b> <b>plants).</b>|$|E

Seeded species were fairway wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), luna pubescent wheatgrass (A. trichophorum), Russian wildrye (Elymus junceus), and Ladak alfalfa (Medicago sativa). Severe wind erosion on the study area occurred the first spring. Total <b>seeded</b> <b>plant</b> densities and cover were significantly higher with the imprinting treatment. Production of <b>seeded</b> <b>plants</b> was higher on the imprinted areas the first 2 years; thereafter, compensatory growth within the thinner drilled stand resulted in similar production levels between treatments.

25|$|Like animals, {{plants have}} {{developed}} specialized {{male and female}} gametes. Within <b>seed</b> <b>plants,</b> male gametes are contained within hard coats, forming pollen. The female gametes of plants are contained within ovules; once fertilized by pollen these form seeds which, like eggs, contain the nutrients necessary {{for the development of}} the embryonic plant.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{itself is}} not the male gamete. Each pollen grain {{contains}} vegetative (non-reproductive) cells (only a single cell in most flowering plants but several in other <b>seed</b> <b>plants)</b> and a generative (reproductive) cell.

25|$|In non-flowering <b>seed</b> <b>plants,</b> pollen germinates in {{the pollen}} chamber, located beneath the micropyle, {{underneath}} the integuments of the ovule. A pollen tube is produced, which grows into the nucellus to provide nutrients for the developing sperm cells.

25|$|In West Africa, the wet phase {{ushered in}} an {{expanding}} rainforest and wooded savanna from Senegal to Cameroon. Between 9000 and 5000 BC, Niger–Congo speakers domesticated the oil palm and raffia palm. Two <b>seed</b> <b>plants,</b> black-eyed peas and voandzeia (African groundnuts), were domesticated, followed by okra and kola nuts. Since {{most of the}} plants grew in the forest, the Niger–Congo speakers invented polished stone axes for clearing forest.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} <b>seed</b> <b>plants</b> {{is a problem}} that still remains unsolved. However, more and more data tends to place this origin in the middle Devonian. The {{description}} in 2004 of the proto-seed Runcaria heinzelinii in the Givetian of Belgium is an indication of that ancient origin of seed-plants. As with modern ferns, most land plants before this time reproduced by sending spores into the air, that would land and become whole new plants.|$|E

25|$|The {{transfer}} of pollen grains {{to the female}} reproductive structure (pistil in angiosperms) is called pollination. This transfer can be mediated by the wind, {{in which case the}} plant is described as anemophilous (literally wind-loving). Anemophilous plants typically produce great quantities of very lightweight pollen grains, sometimes with air-sacs. Non-flowering <b>seed</b> <b>plants</b> (e.g. pine trees) are characteristically anemophilous. Anemophilous flowering plants generally have inconspicuous flowers. Entomophilous (literally insect-loving) plants produce pollen that is relatively heavy, sticky and protein-rich, for dispersal by insect pollinators attracted to their flowers. Many insects and some mites are specialized to feed on pollen, and are called palynivores.|$|E
25|$|Wind {{pollination}} is {{the reproductive}} strategy {{adopted by the}} grasses, sedges, rushes and catkin-bearing plants. Other flowering plants are mostly pollinated by insects (or birds or bats), {{which seems to be}} the primitive state, and some plants have secondarily developed wind pollination. Some plants that are wind pollinated have vestigial nectaries, and other plants like common heather that are regularly pollinated by insects, produce clouds of pollen and some wind pollination is inevitable. The hoary plantain is primarily wind pollinated, but is also visited by insects which pollinate it. In general, showy, colourful, fragrant flowers like sunflowers, orchids and Buddleja are insect pollinated. The only entomophilous plants that are not <b>seed</b> <b>plants</b> are the dung-mosses of the family Splachnaceae.|$|E
25|$|For {{the process}} of {{pollination}} to be successful, a pollen grain produced by the anther, the male part of a flower, must be transferred to a stigma, the female part of the flower, of a plant of the same species. The process is rather different in angiosperms (flowering plants) from what it is in gymnosperms (other <b>seed</b> <b>plants).</b> In angiosperms, after the pollen grain has landed on the stigma, it creates a pollen tube which grows down the style until it reaches the ovary. Sperm cells from the pollen grain then move along the pollen tube, enter the egg cell through the micropyle and fertilise it, resulting {{in the production of}} a seed.|$|E
