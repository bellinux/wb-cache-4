5|$|Because {{of their}} long {{association}} with humans, cockroaches are frequently {{referred to in}} popular culture. In Western culture, cockroaches are often depicted as dirty pests. In a 1750–1752 journal, Peter Osbeck noted that cockroaches were frequently seen and {{found their way to}} the bakeries, after the <b>sailing</b> <b>ship</b> Gothenburg ran aground and was destroyed by rocks.|$|E
50|$|Originally <b>sailing</b> <b>ships</b> were used. Between 1880 and 1890, <b>sailing</b> <b>ships</b> were {{replaced}} by steamers.|$|R
50|$|On 8 July, the Venetians were {{somewhat}} scattered, with five <b>sailing</b> <b>ships,</b> under Battaglia, {{close to the}} Turks. He was unsupported against them until Barbarigo with six <b>sailing</b> <b>ships</b> engaged the Turkish rowing vessels. The Turks retired north, towing some of their <b>sailing</b> <b>ships,</b> toward the channel between Naxos and Paros.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>sailing</b> <b>ships</b> were {{superseded}} by engine-powered {{ships in the}} 19th century, recreational <b>sailing</b> <b>ships</b> and yachts continue to be designed and constructed.|$|R
5|$|On the {{following}} day Huron encountered another <b>sailing</b> <b>ship,</b> the Lebanon, heading for New York. Dorian, the five passengers and twelve of the crew chose to transfer to Lebanon. The other crewmen, possibly anticipating a hostile reception in their home port, chose to remain with Huron and proceed to Quebec, where she arrived on October 13.|$|E
5|$|The station's pictogram, a frigate <b>sailing</b> <b>ship,</b> pays {{homage to}} Seattle's roots as a timber {{supplier}} for shipbuilders. It was created in 2009 by Christian French {{as part of the}} Stellar Connections series and its points represent nearby destinations, including Seattle City Hall, Coleman Dock, the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park, and King Street Station.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of sailing ships, but they all have certain basic things in common. Except for rotor ships using the Magnus effect, every <b>sailing</b> <b>ship</b> has a hull, rigging {{and at least one}} mast to hold up the sails that use the wind to power the ship. Ocean journeys by <b>sailing</b> <b>ship</b> can take many months, and a common hazard is becoming becalmed because of lack of wind, or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction. A severe storm could lead to shipwreck, and the loss of all hands. Sailing ships can only carry a certain quantity of supplies in their hold, so they have to plan long voyages carefully to include appropriate provisions, including fresh water.|$|E

50|$|The company's initial {{products}} were steel-hulled <b>sailing</b> <b>ships</b> designed for long sea voyages. At that time steamships had {{a relatively short}} range, {{while many of the}} advantages of steel construction still applied to <b>sailing</b> <b>ships</b> as much as to steam. The company built its first steamship in 1900, while still continuing to build <b>sailing</b> <b>ships</b> until the late 1930s.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{small-scale}} fighting {{happened the}} next day, {{and at the}} end of it, the Ottoman fleet had lost 4 large <b>sailing</b> <b>ships,</b> 2 pinks, 5 galleasses and 13 galleys captured, and 22 <b>sailing</b> <b>ships,</b> 4 galleasses and 34 galleys sunk or burnt. Only 2 Ottoman <b>sailing</b> <b>ships</b> and 14 galleys escaped. Of the captured ships, Malta received 2 galleasses, 8 galleys and 1 [...] "super galley" [...] (or galleass?). The Venetians lost 3 <b>sailing</b> <b>ships</b> burnt and their casualties were 207 killed, 260 wounded and 94 missing. Maltese casualties were 40 killed and 100 or more wounded. Some 5,000 Christian slaves employed in the Ottoman fleet were freed.|$|R
5|$|Scheer {{wrote his}} memoirs of the Great War in 1919, which were {{translated}} into English the following year. In October 1920, an intruder broke into Scheer's house and murdered his wife, Emillie, his maid, and injured his daughter Else. The man then {{committed suicide in}} the cellar. Following the incident, Scheer retreated into solitude. He wrote his autobiography, entitled Vom Segelschiff zum U-Boot (From <b>Sailing</b> <b>Ship</b> to Submarine), which was published on 6 November 1925.|$|E
5|$|The French ironclad Montcalm was a wooden-hulled armored {{corvette}} {{built for}} the French Navy in the mid-1860s. She was named after Major General Montcalm who lost the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759. She played a minor role in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 where she captured one Prussian <b>sailing</b> <b>ship.</b> Montcalm {{spent most of her}} later career abroad, either in Chinese waters or the Pacific Ocean. The ship was condemned in 1891.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain of}} a <b>sailing</b> <b>ship</b> seeks a course along which the winds can be {{expected}} to blow in the direction of travel. During the Age of Sail, the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access, and therefore had a direct effect on European empire-building and thus on modern political geography. For example, Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all.|$|E
50|$|At {{the early}} 1880s Mattson started {{shipping}} business first as minor shareholder of various ships, later as sole owner. He bought old, at least quarter of century old <b>sailing</b> <b>ships.</b> By the 1890s steamers started to replace <b>sailing</b> <b>ships</b> and Mattson could obtain good <b>sailing</b> <b>ships</b> for relatively cheap. Until {{the end of}} the 19th century Mattson only owned wooden ships; in 1900 he bought majority ownership of two steel-hulled windjammers and one barque.|$|R
50|$|The square rig is aerodynamically {{the most}} {{efficient}} running rig (i.e., sailing downwind), and stayed popular on ocean-going <b>sailing</b> <b>ships</b> {{until the end of}} the Age of Sail. The last commercial <b>sailing</b> <b>ships,</b> windjammers, were usually square-rigged four-masted barques.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sailing</b> <b>ships</b> {{are limited}} in their maximum size {{compared}} to ships with heat engines, so economies of scale are also limited. The heaviest <b>sailing</b> <b>ships</b> (limited to those vessels for which sails were the primary means of propulsion) never exceeded 14,000 tons displacement. <b>Sailing</b> <b>ships</b> are therefore also very limited in the supply capacity of their holds, {{so they have to}} plan long voyages carefully to include many stops to take on [...] and, in the days before watermakers, fresh water.|$|R
5|$|U-27s next {{victims were}} all {{encountered}} in mid-September. On 11 September, the French <b>sailing</b> <b>ship</b> Antoinette was seized as a prize and towed into {{the port of}} Beyrouth. Starting three days later, Holub and U-27 sent an additional ten small ships to the bottom, including the final six all on 20 September. Except for the two largest ships—the 113-ton Agios Nicolas and the 103-ton Theologos—none were over 60 tons.|$|E
5|$|A ship of {{the line}} was a large, unarmored wooden <b>sailing</b> <b>ship</b> which mounted a battery of up to 120 smoothbore guns and carronades. The ship {{of the line}} {{developed}} gradually over centuries and, apart from growing in size, it changed little between the adoption of line of battle tactics in the early 17th century {{and the end of}} the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 15 May U-43 opened fire with her deck gun and {{anti-aircraft}} guns on the 488 ton French three-masted <b>sailing</b> <b>ship</b> Notre Dame du Châtelet, en route from St. Malo to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to fish. After being hit by 45 shells the ship sank. Lüth suspected that the vessel was reporting the positions of U-boats to Allied forces, while the 10 survivors thought they had been attacked by a British submarine. They, from her crew of 38, abandoned ship in two lifeboats. Two were picked up by the Italian submarine Otaria on 23 May.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, a {{memorial}} stone was erected at Black River, Jamaica, near where Zong would have landed. A <b>sailing</b> <b>ship</b> representing Zong was sailed to Tower Bridge in London in March 2007 {{to commemorate the}} 200th anniversary of the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, {{at a cost of}} £300,000. The vessel housed depictions of the Zong massacre and the slave trade. It was accompanied by HMS Northumberland, with an exhibition on board commemorating the role of the Royal Navy after 1807 in the suppression of the slave trade.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} account of Japanese contact in Palau occurred in 1820, when a coastal <b>sailing</b> <b>ship</b> was blown off course and eight surviving men {{spent five years}} in Palau until 1825. Japanese traders began to establish settlements from the mid-19th century onwards, and by 1890 two Japanese trading stations had been established. Many of these traders married the daughters of local chieftains and raised local families. When Japan annexed Palau from Germany in 1914, Japanese settlers and their descendants acted as state liaison officials and interpreters for the Japanese military administration.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type of Mycenaean vessel based on depictions of {{contemporary}} art was the oared galley with long and narrow hulls. The shape of the hull was constructed in a way to maximize the number of rowers. Thus, a higher speed could have been achieved regardless of wind conditions. Although it carried mast and sail, it was less efficient as a <b>sailing</b> <b>ship.</b> The Mycenaean galley offered certain advantages. Although lighter compared to the oared-sailing ship of the Minoans of Crete, it seated more rowers. Its steering mechanism was a triangular steering oar, a forerunner of the latter steering oar of Archaic era.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of her}} career, U-16 {{operated}} in the Adriatic out of Kotor patrolling off the Albanian coast. The U-boat sank one small <b>sailing</b> <b>ship</b> in November and seized another in December. U-16 carried Field Marshal Svetozar Borojević of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an observer while performing diving tests after engine repairs in January 1916. A water leak in March flooded U-16s batteries and put the U-boat out of action for about six weeks of repairs. While operating off Vlorë in mid-October 1916, U-16 sank an Italian destroyer acting as a convoy escort. U-16 was sunk in the ensuing action, but sources are not clear on the exact cause of her sinking. In all U-16 sank three ships with a combined tonnage of 711. She was the only U-10-class submarine sunk during the war.|$|E
5|$|The Hero leaves {{their home}} country of Aliahan to travel the world and {{complete}} their father's quest to defeat Baramos. A major portion of the adventure is the quest to acquire the last {{two of the three}} keys needed to open doors throughout the game. After saving two people of the town of Baharata from the rogue Kandar and stealing back the King of Romaly's crown, the Hero receives Black Pepper, which they then trade for a <b>sailing</b> <b>ship</b> at Portoga. With the ship, the Hero acquires the Final Key and the six mystical orbs which are used to revive the legendary bird Ramia. Ramia allows the Hero and their party to travel to Baramos' castle, which is surrounded by mountains.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest II {{is noted}} for greatly {{expanding}} upon the gameplay {{of the previous}} game, Dragon Quest. The game {{is the first in}} the series to feature multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, as well as a <b>sailing</b> <b>ship.</b> It also allowed the player to land the ship anywhere, making it possible to explore the entire game world in an open-ended manner. It included other new gameplay features such as weapons which cast spells when used in battles. Compared with its predecessor, Dragon Warrior II offers a wider array of spells and items and a much larger world. The game also expanded the inventory management system of its predecessor by giving each character an individual inventory that holds up to eight items, placing a greater emphasis on conservative item management between the characters. Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line was also the first Dragon Quest game to include a game of chance (played with Lottery Tickets that the player finds), and was also the first Dragon Quest game to use multiple key types and to include travel doors (warp gates).|$|E
