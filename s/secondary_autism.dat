Fecha de lectura: 22 - 12 - 2015 The {{main objective}} of this thesis is framed in the research on Cognitive and Social Neuroscience (Psychobiology of Facial Information Processing) developed in the Department of Biological Psychology and Health at the Autonomous University of Madrid (Recognized Research Group PS- 019). According among others to Hobson (1989, 2002), Langdell (1978) and Rutter (1983), {{we assume that the}} alterations in the processing of socioemotional information shown by autistic children always involve severe disorders of nonverbal communication that precede alterations in verbal communication and are due deficits in the early development of the nervous system. We further assume that autism can be reliably diagnosed from a proper evaluation of the socio-affective behavior (Asperger, 1944; Kanner, 1943). This approach is consistent with the progress experienced in recent years by differential diagnosis of autism, and the introduction of a more dimensional perspective of autism that involved the introduction of a new construct, that of "autism spectrum disorders" (ASD) (Fombonne et al., 1997; Frith and Happe, 2006; Orte et al, 1995). According to this conceptual and methodological approach, in this thesis we defend that the proper understanding of the behavior of people with ASD requires delving into the relationship between the neurobiology of autism and the development of early socioemotional behavior (Baron-Cohen, Knickmeyer y Belmonte, 2005 Herbert et al, 2006; Persico & Bourgeron, 2006; Rutter, 2000; Wing & Potter, 2009). But despite the advances made in understanding autism and in its diagnosis, psycho-diagnosis is still insufficient to detect cognitive and social impairments in young children who are later identified as autistic, what not only greatly complicates this aim, but also, from a much broader perspective, early intervention and prevention of major social imbalances that characterize the behavior of people with ASD and {{the quality of life of}} their families (Baron et al., 2006; Gray, 2002; Pisula, 1998; Yirmiya & Shaked, 2005). Therefore, we assumed in this thesis the need to investigate the possibility of defining more accurate early indicators of autistic behavior. In particular, we proposed the possibility to improve early detection of autism symptoms through observation and functional analysis of the nonverbal communication behavior of the child with ASD, and more specifically, focusing on early nonverbal socioemotional communication. Consequently, we started with a precise and systematic identification of what emotions are the autistic children able to exhibit but also what stimuli or situations trigger these emotions (Rogers, Dawson & Vismara, 2012; Zwaigenbaum, 2009). In order to achieve this aim, this thesis focused on a group of 15 children suffering from primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>autism,</b> all attending the same special school, with a chronological age ranging from 3 to 15 years and mental ages between 12 and 48 months. The participants were studied in their normal school environment with special attention to their emotional expressions (facial, posture, voice [...] .), particularly at the time of encoding and expressing emotions in response to the basic emotions expressed by their teachers and other contextual stimuli In order to be as precise as possible, we considered it more appropriate not to restrict beforehand the stimulating contexts and the socioemotional expressions that we should study (which is common in this type of study), as well as to break down all interactions that may be observed among children with different autism spectrum disorders and their educators in their natural socio-communicative context. Therefore, we described the stimulus backgrounds and the consequences of both typical and altered socioemotional behaviors, with a special focus on the emotional expressions. For this purpose, we structured this thesis in two main parts. In Part I, entitled "Introduction", we first justified how the assumption of psychological-dimensional construct of "autism spectrum disorders" enriches the traditional clinical concept of "autism, and gives meaning to the progress made in recent years in the diagnosis and treatment of childhood autism through a clearly multidisciplinary approach. We also reviewed the explanatory theories of infantile autism, paying special attention to neurobiological theories and genetic basis of autism in relation to the early development of the nervous system. The objective was to understand why there manifest different forms of autism, and which are the differences between children with primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>autism,</b> more concretely if they show specific alterations on neural structures and functions that make up the social brain. We ended this first part inquiring whether there is any link between the neurobiological alterations that show children with different forms of autism and early basic skills for social communication, particularly in their use of facial expression of basic emotions during nonverbal communication. Part II, entitled "Empirical Studies" picks up three successive studies devoted to the analysis of socioemotional behavior of children with primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>autism</b> in the natural school environment: 1) "Observation of the socioaffective behaviors of autistic children in natural school settings" - a study that implied a direct observation of behaviors after completing an extensive literature review about the topic and designing an ethological log sheet-, 2) " The emotional behavior of autistic children in the school environment, "- a study based on video recordings and applying objective systems for observing and codifying emotional expressions, the FACS and the AFFEX-, and 3) " The emotions of autistic children perceived by parents and educators"- a study based on questionnaires specifically developed for this purpose intended to identify which stimuli and responses consider adults familiar with the autistic children as emotional. All with the aim to assess whether this new approach in early diagnosis of autism could help to anticipate future alterations in nonverbal and verbal communication, as well as to improve their perception of people who are commonly in contact with autistic childrenEsta tesis ha recibido el apoyo institucional por parte de la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid mediante una Ayuda a Tercer Ciclo.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how {{accurately}} autism was depicted in the media (specifically in television) when compared to the scientifically accepted definition. Data for this study was gathered using coding sheets that outlined the definitive and <b>secondary</b> characteristics of <b>autism.</b> While watching six episodes of the television show The Big Bang Theory and six episodes of the television show Parenthood, examiners evaluated scenes involving the character with autism using a separate coding sheet for each designated scene. Examiners used the continuous coding method, identifying each instance of particular trait observed throughout the scene. Fifteen different traits were analyzed. Traits were recorded on a coding sheet. Results were analyzed qualitatively then compared to scientific definitions of autism to assess the validity of each show. Characteristics of autism were present in both the adult with autism in The Big Bang Theory and the child with autism in Parenthood. Both shows focused primarily on the DSM-IV features to represent the character with <b>autism.</b> <b>Secondary</b> characteristics were also exhibited, but were not as prominent. Differences between the adult character and the child character were also noted...|$|R
40|$|This book {{is one of}} the {{research}} outputs generated from a grant funded by the the Greek Ministry of Education and the European Union. It includes 2 major sections. Section 1 includes the description of educational activities for the integration of students with autism in the regular school. All activities are organised around 7 topics as implemented by teachers in special and regular schools in Greece. Section 2 includes one chapter on the assessment of skills for supported employment and one chapter with educational activities for the vocational employment of adolescents with autism. These activities are organised around 7 vocational settings in the community (i. e. Nursery, ceramics workshop, candle making factory, supermarket) as designed and applied by teachers and employees for <b>secondary</b> students with <b>autism.</b> Also, there is a long addendum including 3 sections, listing all the activities and schools/colleges and work sites that participated in this funded project. In the last section, all names of teachers who attended this professional development program are given...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{benefits}} to engaging in {{regular physical activity}} such as increased {{quality of life and}} decreased levels of obesity. However, individuals with autism spectrum disorder often do not engage in healthy levels of physical activity. Low motivation, poor motor skills, and behavioral challenges combine to make engaging in regular physical activity a challenge. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether direct (i. e., in-person) praise statements or technology-based praise statements were more effective in increasing engagement in physical activity for <b>secondary</b> students with <b>autism</b> spectrum disorder. Participants engaged in aerobic activity while receiving praise statements either directly or through technology. Results were mixed for participants. Two of the three participants performed better and preferred the technology-based condition, while one participant excelled in and preferred the direct condition. The two participants who performed better in the technology-based condition were able to maintain performance levels during the fading conditions and generalize their performance to a new setting. The participant who performed better in the direct condition was unable to maintain performance levels during fading conditions or generalize performance to a new setting. ...|$|R
40|$|Many <b>secondary</b> {{students}} with <b>autism</b> (SWA) {{included in the}} general education (GE) classroom demonstrate academic and behavioral challenges. Most GE teachers who have inclusive SWA in their classes receive little or no training on evidence-based practices to address these challenges. The purpose of this qualitative bounded case study was to explore secondary GE teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of and experiences with the academic and behavioral challenges of inclusive SWA. Theoretical frameworks of the weak central coherence theory for autism and executive dysfunction grounded the study. Data from 6 purposefully chosen secondary GE inclusion teachers, who educated SWA and {{students with}} autism spectrum disorder from one middle school setting, were collected using individual semistructured telephone interviews and independent participant journals. Criteria to be a participant included teachers who had taught more than 5 years, earned a master 2 ̆ 7 s degree, and taught inclusive SWA. The data were thematically analyzed using a segmenting-and-labeling open coding process. Participants revealed that secondary inclusive SWA had low cognitive processing, difficulty understanding content and maintaining an adequate pace while working on tasks, and demand of teacher attention. Furthermore, SWA demonstrated behavioral challenges controlling emotional outbursts, being organized, and socialization with peers. It is recommended that GE teachers have paraprofessionals with SWA preparation, opportunities for multilevel collaboration, and increased autism-specific training to assist in meeting academic and emotional needs of SWA. These actions could contribute to positive social change through assisting GE teachers in planning and improved instruction and postsecondary outcomes for secondary inclusive SWA...|$|R
