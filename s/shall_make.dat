5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{became a}} {{follower}} of the Báb in Persia in 1845. Three years after the Báb was executed, he was exiled to Baghdad (then {{a part of the}} Ottoman Empire), where in 1863 he proclaimed the Bahá'í Faith when he declared himself He whom God <b>shall</b> <b>make</b> manifest, a messianic figure in Babi theology. Bahá'u'lláh based this announcement on a vision of the Maid of Heaven he claimed to have had while imprisoned in the Síyáh-Chál in Tehran, Persia. He would be further exiled to Edirne and ultimately to the prison city of Acre, Palestine (present-day Israel), where he died. He wrote , most notably the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Kitáb-i-Íqán, and the Hidden Words.|$|E
5|$|Captain Scarlet also {{formed the}} basis of three comic strips drawn for the weekly children's comic, TV Century 21. Spanning 17 issues (numbers 141–157) from September 1967 to January 1968, the strip adventures were written by Angus P. Allan with artwork by Ron Embleton, and were titled We Will Destroy Unity City, We Will Destroy the Observatory Network and We <b>Shall</b> <b>Make</b> Earth a Planet of Silence. Following the end of the TV series, the comic {{continued}} the story of the Captain Scarlet universe, with later strips revealing that the Mysterons deactivate their Martian complex and relinquish their control over Captain Black, while Scarlet himself leaves Spectrum to make use of his powers in the fight against Earth-bound criminals and threats. The Mysterons ultimately re-awaken, prompting Scarlet and Spectrum to resume their struggle. Keith Watson also worked on these comic book adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Per , {{state and}} union governments, as duty, <b>shall</b> <b>make</b> further {{detailed}} policies and laws for implementation considering DPSPs as fundamental policy. In contrary to Article 37, many {{policies have been}} implemented by state and union governments which go against the DPSPs such as using intoxicating drinks as source of major tax revenue instead of implementing prohibition for better health of people, separation of judiciary from executive, uniform civil code for the citizen, etc. When the union government feels that a DPSP is no longer useful to the nation, it shall be deleted from Constitution by bringing {{a constitutional amendment to}} remove ambiguity in policy making / direction. Judiciary can repeal any policy/law devised by the government which is diametrically opposite to any DPSP.|$|E

25|$|The Báb prophesied {{that the}} messianic figure He whom God <b>shall</b> <b>make</b> {{manifest}} would emerge {{some time in}} the future. Many of the Báb's writings support the belief that He whom God <b>shall</b> <b>make</b> manifest's arrival would be imminent. The Bahá'í belief is that the Báb's writings allude to the year 9, while the Azali belief is that He whom God <b>shall</b> <b>make</b> manifest would come after 2000 years.|$|E

25|$|While the Báb {{claimed a}} station of revelation, he also claimed no {{finality}} for his revelation. A constant theme in his works, especially the Persian Bayan {{was that of}} the great Promised One, the next embodiment of the Primal Will, whom the Báb termed He whom God <b>shall</b> <b>make</b> manifest, promised in the sacred writings of previous religions would soon establish the Kingdom of God on the Earth.
