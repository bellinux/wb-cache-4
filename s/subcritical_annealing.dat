40|$|Cold forming {{processes}} present {{advantages to}} produce components with tight tolerances {{to the final}} (net) shape, eliminating significant production costs. These processes requires forming parts in a soft condition, with high ductility and formability. Jethete M 152 alloy is a cold formable 13 -Cr% martensitic stainless steel used in the aerospace industry. However, the inherent high strength of this material presents challenges {{in terms of the}} high loads and contact and friction stresses developed during cold forming processes. The main purpose of this work was to explore the impact of different types of annealing treatments (subcritical, full and isothermal treatments) on the softening and work hardening behavior of this alloy. Microstructural and mechanical testing analysis were conducted. The results indicate that only <b>subcritical</b> <b>annealing</b> treatments (T < Ar 1) were successful by reducing the strength and hardness levels. However no significant effect on both work hardening behavior and uniform elongation was found. Due to the high hardenability of this alloy, those softening treatments which require the austenization of the material were translated into the formation of freshly (as-quenched) martensite, resulting into an increase of strength, loss in ductility properties and a significant change in the work hardening behaviour. Despite of the large differences in strength properties and work hardening behaviour across all the softening treatments analyzed, no significant microstructural differences were found. These results indicate that such differences are associated mainly to both dislocation density and the substructure developed during tempering/annealing at high temperatures...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA non-circular drawing {{sequence}} {{was investigated}} for manufacturing {{medium carbon steel}} wires with improved spheroidization of cementite for better cold workability compared to those produced by the conventional wire drawing. The wire drawing and non-circular drawing processes with 20 % area reduction per each pass were numerically and experimentally applied up to the fourth pass (total area reduction of 59 %). The drawn wire by the non-circular drawing sequence shows higher average effective strain value than {{the one of the}} wire drawing in the numerical result. To investigate the effect of prior cold working on spheroidization of the drawn wire, spheroidization annealing was conducted at subcritical temperature of 705 oC for 2 h for both processes. According to the present investigation, the wires subject to <b>subcritical</b> <b>annealing</b> following the non-circular drawing sequence showed the reduced ultimate tensile strength and micro-hardness, and the enhanced reduction of area compared to those for the wire drawing. From upsetting test results, cold workability was also improved for the annealed specimen processed by the non-circular drawing sequence compared to the one produced by the wire drawing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to investigate microstructure changes during spheroidization annealing. Owing to the SEM results, the spheroidization of the annealed specimens processed by the non-circular drawing sequence was improved than the one produced by the wire drawing. It is demonstrated that the non-circular drawing sequence could manufacture the wires with improved spheroidization of cementite and cold workability compared to the wire drawing in the present work...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work {{addresses}} {{the influence of}} distinct microstructures and deep rolling parameters on the behaviour of AISI 1060 steel. For this purpose, the work material was initially subjected to <b>subcritical</b> and full <b>annealing</b> {{as well as to}} hardening through quenching and tempering. The specimens were subsequently deep rolled under different rolling pressures and numbers of passes. The findings indicate that plastic deformation increases with rolling pressure and number of passes due to more intense cold working and that under identical deep rolling conditions the fully annealed material presents more severe deformation than the subcritically annealed samples. Moreover, the ability of deep rolling to increase surface hardness decreases with the elevation of the hardness of the original material. The values of the yield and ultimate tensile strength were affected in different manners by deep rolling depending on work material condition and the tensile residual stresses observed after turning were converted into compressive values by deep rolling. Finally, the elevation of rolling pressure and number of passes presented distinct effects on the microhardness distribution beneath the surface depending on the work material condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} for lighter, safer and fuel efficient cars {{has created a}} major stir in the steel research society to develop advanced automotive steels. Since there is a trade off between strength and ductility, most of the conventional high strength steels do not address the strength-formability combination. With {{the realization of the}} TRIP phenomenon first in austenitic stainless steels, a new generation of advanced steels called TRIP steels were realised with an inexpensive and easier to process C-Mn-Si chemistry. TRIP or TRransformation Induced Plasticity is a phenomenon where the timely strain induced transformation of Retained Austenite (RA) to Martensite locally strengthens the steel at the point of plastic instability, causing failure by necking to be postponed and shifted elsewhere along the steel. This phenomenon repeated over and over again allows increased levels of strength and ductility, prior to fracture. In current TRIP grades, the retained austenite particles present have to posses certain characteristics such as, optimum carbon concentration, optimum grain size and morphology etc. in order to account toward mechanical properties. Such limiting characteristics in turn minimize the processing window and make TRIP processing expensive and difficult to control. In this work, it is suggested that Tempered Martensite Assisted Steels (TMAS) obtained from TRIP steels via <b>subcritical</b> <b>annealing</b> of cold rolled TRIP steels may potentially replace TRIP steels. Relationship between the retained austenite volume fractions and mechanical properties was developed for TRIP steels. The effect of variation of retained austenite on tempered martensite volume fraction in TMAS, which in turn affect the mechanical properties was also investigated in depth. Results indicate that tempered martensite particles in TMAS do not have any limiting factors {{as in the case of}} RA in TRIP steels, in order to contribute toward enhancement of mechanical properties. Results also indicate that TMAS offers better strength levels compared to TRIP steels for same the level of formability. Retained austenite volume fractions in TRIP steels were measured through XRD. Cold rolling of the samples was done in a laboratory scale rolling machine. The microstructures were analysed using conventional and color etching techniques. A new color etching technique for viewing all the four major phases in TRIP steel was developed in this work. The mechanical properties of both TRIP and TMAS were assessed by shear punch testing. And finally, the relationship between tempered martensite volume fraction and TMAS properties was developed and was compared to TRIP properties...|$|E
40|$|Control of {{austenite}} grain structure {{is of great}} importance in heat treatment process, because the prior {{austenite grain}} structure entirely affects the size and morphology of the final microstructure, and thus to largely determine the final mechanical properties of steels. The present study mainly focuses on the abnormal grain growth (AGG) of reversely transformed austenite in 0. 2 mass% carbon steel and attempts to control it. The AGG of austenite which leads to extraordinary coarse austenite grains and bimodal grain size distributions degrades final mechanical properties of steels, because an initial variation in prior austenite grain size {{can result in a}} coarse and inhomogeneous final grain structures. Hence, AGG in austenite grain structure during the heat treatment processes is very harmful, which is quite worth to be investigated. AGG has been extensively investigated because of both its technological relevance in the steel industry and scientific interest. In spite of the considerable research effort, there are still some important issues that remain to be resolved. For example, it is unclear whether the initial microstructure of steel, such as ferrite/pearlite (F/P) banded and non-banded structure affect the austenite abnormal grain coarsening or not. Since the banded structure with a great inhomogeneity in alloy elements distribution, it may have a great effect on the austenite abnormal grain coarsening behavior. On the other hand, it is unclear how to control the AGG of austenite during the heat treatment process. Therefore, {{the purpose of the present}} study is to investigate the abnormal grain coarsening behavior of reversely transformed austenite and attempts to control it. The contents of this thesis are described as follows. In Chapter 1, the research background is illustrated. By describing some steel manufacturing processes, the importance of refinement of austenite grains during reheating is emphasized. Moreover, it is explained that the occurrence of AGG of austenite grains degrades the final mechanical properties of steel. The motivation and purpose of present study are also illustrated. Chapter 2 is the review of the literatures related to the AGG of reversely transformed austenite grain structures. The reported mechanisms for the occurrence of AGG and the effects of cold deformation on the austenite grain structure and precipitation are summarized. In Chapter 3, the grain growth behavior of austenite reversely-transformed from F/P banded and non-banded steels has been studied systematically. It was found that the grain-coarsening temperature, Tc, (the temperature at which abnormal grain growth occurs) of the initially banded F/P steel is quite low compared with that of the non-banded steel. In the F/P banded steel, it was found that the abnormal grains originate from the former ferrite region. The occurrence of AGG isIIIessentially attributable not to the austenite nucleation process during heating but to the grain growth process after the completion of austenizing. It was proposed that the lowered Tc in the F/P banded steel is due to the non-uniform pinning-effect of AlN precipitates between former ferrite and pearlite regions. In chapter 4, the effect of cold deformation on AGG of austenite in F/P banded steel has been investigated. It was found that the low Tc in the F/P banded steel can be increased significantly by applying cold deformation prior to austenitizing. The severity of AGG above the Tc is also largely reduced by the cold deformation. This is attributed to the fine and uniformly distributed AlN precipitates caused by the cold deformation. In Chapter 5, the effects of cold deformation on AGG of austenite in non-banded steel have been studied. It was found that the effect of cold deformation on AGG of austenite depends on the initial state and distribution of AlN precipitates. When the non-banded steel with aluminum and nitrogen in solution, cold deformation reduces the AGG temperature-range (a temperature range of occurrence of AGG) of austenite. While the non-banded steels are subjected to a long time <b>subcritical</b> <b>annealing</b> treatment making the AlN fully precipitated and growth, the occurrence of AGG can be completely inhibited by applying cold deformation. This can be explained by the size and spatial distributions of the precipitates affected by the cold deformation. In Chapter 6, the local plastic strain distribution and its effect on the on the austenite grain growth has been studied. It was found that large macroscopic plastic strains with high strain rates lead to steep and narrow distribution profile of local plastic strain. The peak of the local plastic strain profile does not appear at the deformed surface but immediately beneath the surface. The deformation at high strain rates is favorable to localize the plastic strain in the vicinity of the surface. On the other hand, the deformation at lower strain rates makes plastically deformed zone wider. The local plastic strain distribution has a strong effect on the austenite grain growth. The austenite grain structure near the surface can be effectively controlled by the local plastic strain distribution. In Chapter 7, the misorientation manifestations in chemical etching contrast has been studied in cold deformed iron. The chemical etching is performed by using nital. It was found that the chemical etching contrast strongly reflects the crystallographic orientation. The gradual change in chemical etching contrast inside the individual deformed grains gives information of both the misorientation and local plastic strain within the grains. This method can provide an easy and alternative way to qualitatively understand the misorientation and local plastic strain distributions in the microstructures. Finally, the important findings in this study are summarized in Chapter 8...|$|E
