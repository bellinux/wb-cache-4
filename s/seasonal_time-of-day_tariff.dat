40|$|Renewable energy {{technologies}} (including solar) have enjoyed {{a period of}} rapid growth in recent years, largely due to government subsidies of various kinds. But renewable {{energy technologies}} cannot expect to replace fossil fuels {{on the back of}} the taxpayers or ratepayers; they will have to become price competitive. Most studies on the economics of renewable energy systems fail to consider one of the most powerful trends in their favor: the rising cost of fossil fuels. This study provides an economic analysis of residential solar systems (photovoltaic and water heating) in Michigan and Hawaii. It shows that residential grid-intertied PV systems are not currently economically attractive in Michigan under any likely assumptions, while higher utility rates and greater solar radiation in Hawaii make a PV system a reasonable investment on economics alone – without government subsidies. Solar water heating systems are very financially attractive in Hawaii and somewhat attractive in Michigan, depending on assumptions about the future rate of utility price escalations. In either location, without government assistance, solar water heaters are more financially attractive than PV systems.

40|$|AbstractAs {{renewable}} energy generating capacity increases on electricity grids, technology {{is needed to}} balance the supply and demand of energy. In order to manage the demand side of electricity, <b>time-of-day</b> (TOD) <b>tariffs</b> are a simple economic mechanism that encourages consumers to smooth the diurnal demand profile by shifting consumption to off-peak times. The management of supply by {{renewable energy}} generators can be achieved using energy storage. This study investigates the use of {{compressed air energy storage}} (CAES) to de-couple a wind energy converter (WEC) from the electricity grid and manage its power output. Numerical and thermodynamic models simulate the operation of the system. One year of operation is simulated using 10 minute WEC time-step data for varying CAES capacities in order to optimize the economic performance of the total system. By selling electricity according to TOD tariff schedules, the income generated by a 0. 8 MW WEC using a 4 MWh CAES system is increased by 30 %. The CAES has a round-trip efficiency of 66 % and annually experiences 450 deep cycles as it stores 25 % of the energy generated by the WEC...|$|R

The two primary advances are {{the incorporation of}} (1) explicit measures of consumer interest in and potential use {{of different types of}} PHEVs and (2) a model of the California electricity grid capable of differentiating hourly and seasonal GHG emissions by generation source. We construct PHEV emissions scenarios to address inherent relationships between vehicle design, driving and recharging behaviors, <b>seasonal</b> and <b>time-of-day</b> variation in GHG-intensity of electricity, and total GHG emissions. A sample of 877 California new vehicle buyers provide data on driving, time of day recharge access, and PHEV design interests. The elicited data differ substantially from the assumptions used in previous analyses. We construct electricity demand profiles scaled to one million PHEVs and input them into an hourly California electricity supply model to simulate GHG emissions. Compared to conventional vehicles, consumer-designed PHEVs cut marginal (incremental) GHG emissions by more than one-third in current California energy scenarios and by one-quarter in future energy scenarios [...] reductions similar to those simulated for all-electric PHEV designs.

We show that the timing of energy-intensive household activities can be modeled in terms of classical inventory adjustment processes.

Residential load curve data and data from the National Time Use Study suggest hat economists have tended to underestimate the importance of water heating in affecting the load curve. Because of the relatively long re-order cycle of activities using hot water, and the possibility of timing the water heater, these activities should be quite responsive to well designed time-of-use rate structures, both in the short- and long-run. 1...|$|R
40|$|After {{the change}} in the {{economics}} of generating electricity which took place in 1973, many utilities are examining options to hold down their costs. One fact which is clear is that the difference between peak and off peak generating costs is much larger now than prior to 1973. Utilities are examining two options which can be termed load management. One option is to control discretionary loads during peak periods. Cycling of residential water heaters or shutting off industrial electric furnaces during peak periods are both examples of load control which lower the costs borne by the utility. The other option is the use of <b>seasonal</b> surcharges or <b>time-of-day</b> rates to induce customers to alter their usage patterns. Both these load management options focus on reducing utility costs overall without regard to the cost to the consumers affected by the load management options.

40|$|As {{power grids}} {{incorporate}} increased renewable generation such as wind and solar, their variability creates growing challenges for grid stability and efficiency. We study two facets: power the grid {{is unable to}} accept (curtailment), and power that is assigned zero economic value by the grid (negative or zero price). Collectively we term these "stranded power" or SP. We study stranded power in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), characterizing quantity and temporal structure. First, stranded power {{is available in the}} MISO grid 99 % of the time, and often in intervals > 100 hours, with characteristic <b>seasonal</b> and <b>time-of-day</b> patterns. Average stranded power often exceeds 1 GW, with duty factors as high as 30 %. About 30 % of all wind generation in MISO is stranded. Examination of the top 10 individual sites shows stranded power can be as high as 70 % duty factor and 250 MW. Trends over the past 3. 5 years suggest stranded power is a persistent phenomenon. The study characterizes opportunities to exploit stranded power. We consider using energy storage to increase the utility of stranded power. For a range of power levels and uniformly-distributed storage, adding 5 hours of storage doubles duty factor to 30 % at 4 MW, but another 95 hours is required for the next 15 % increase. At 4 MW with 50 hours of storage, only 3 of 200 sites reach 100 % duty factor, and with 100 hours required for the next 10 sites. Higher power levels require 100 's of hours. Storage at the top 10 sites is more productive, 5 hours increases duty factor to 70 % at 4 MW, but further storage has diminishing benefits. Studies of the amount of power served by storage show that distribution to the best sites provides 2 to 3. 7 -fold advantages over uniform distribution...|$|R

However, {{little is known}} about how detection rates of birds from these surveys differ by season and time of day. We conducted call-broadcast surveys for eight focal species at 56 wetlands throughout Iowa from 15 May– 13 June 2010 (early season) and from 15 June– 10 July 2010 (late season). Our focal species were Pied-billed Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), King Rail (Rallus elegans), Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola), Sora (Porzana carolina), Common Gallinule (Gallinula chloropus), and American Coot (Fulica americana). Surveys were conducted in the early morning (30 mins before sunrise to 3 hrs after sunrise) and late evening (3 hrs before sunset to 30 mins after sunset) in accordance with the North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol. We evaluated marsh bird detection rates as a function of a) time of day (morning and evening survey periods), b) season (early and late in the breeding season), and c) wetland size for four species with the greatest detection rates (Pied-billed Grebe, Least Bittern, Virginia Rail, and Sora). We also evaluated the above effects for two species groups; all eight species pooled and all rails pooled. We found significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) effects on the number of detections for Pied-billed Grebe in response to time of day, time of season, and wetland size; Sora, Virginia Rail, all rails, and all species had an effect of time of season only.

Variation in sperm whale codas, short rhythmic series of clicks, was examined across annual, <b>seasonal,</b> and <b>time-of-day</b> temporal categories. Recordings were made from towed linear arrays during two-week seasonal cruises of the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) spanning May 1992 - August 1994 and October 1996 - August 1997. Archived sperm whale vocalizations were randomly sampled posthoc and codas were classified by the number and temporal pattern of their clicks: Short ([] 5 clicks) versus Long ([] 6 clicks), as well as Regular (equally-spaced clicks), Variable (unevenly-spaced clicks), and Plus-one (double intervals between the last two clicks). A total of 842 codas were analyzed, comprising 17 different coda types. The high number of Regular codas across all years and the lack of consistently significant temporal variation in codas suggest that a resident population of animals inhabits the NGOM. The high percentage of shared coda types between the Caribbean and NGOM may indicate movement of whales between these two regions. More codas (predominantly Long and Variable) were heard during 1996, compared to a greater diversity of coda types during 1997. In 1996, cows and calves were aggregated near the Mouth of the Mississippi River (MOM) and in 1997, whales were found in loose associations over DeSoto Canyon and in the presence of dolphins. More Plus-one codas were found during Spring than Fall, as were more Regular and Short codas recorded in Summer than Fall. During Spring, groups were concentrated near the MOM, and in Summer whales were sparsely distributed across broad areas. High diversity of coda types as well as the abundance of Long and Variable codas is likely related to crepuscular peaks observed in foraging activity and a three-hour cycle associated with deep diving. The proximate differences observed between temporal scales may be attributed to variation in oceanographic conditions affecting the spatial distribution and abundance of sperm whales as well as to contextual differences in behavior. Further research involving more acoustic data as well as comparisons with photo-identification, genetic, and behavioral information are needed to further corroborate the variation observed...|$|R

Even though there are indications for temporal variations in NIF-responsiveness to bright light, scientific insights into potential moderations by season are scarce. Moreover, it is still unknown whether effects of time-of-day influences on NIF effects are persistent throughout the year. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eWe employed a mixed 2 (Light: 165 vs. 1700 lx at eye level, within) x 2 (Season: autumn/winter vs. spring, between) x 2 (Time of day: morning vs. afternoon, between) mixed-model design. During {{each of the two}} 90 -min experimental sessions, participants (autumn/winter: N= 34; spring: N= 39) completed four measurement blocks (incl. one baseline block of 120 lx at eye level) each consisting of a Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) and a Backwards Digit-Span Task (BDST) including easy trials (4 – 6 digits) and difficult trials (7 – 8 digits). Heart rate (HR) and skin conductance level (SCL) were measured continuously. At the end of each lighting condition, subjective sleepiness, vitality and mood were measured. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eResults revealed a clear indication for significant Light * Season interaction effects on both subjective sleepiness and vitality, which appeared only during the morning sessions. Participants felt significantly more vital and less sleepy in winter, but not in spring, after bright light exposure in the morning. In line with these subjective parameters, participants also showed significantly better PVT performance in the morning in autumn/winter but not in spring under bright light exposure. Surprisingly, for difficult working memory performance the opposite was found, namely worse performance during bright light exposure in winter but better performance when exposed to bright light in spring. Effects of bright vs. regular light exposure on physiology were quite subtle and largely nonsignificant. Season did not seem to play an important moderating role in these effects. Overall, it can be concluded that acute illuminance-induced NIF effects on subjective alertness and vitality as well as objectively measured vigilance in the morning are significantly moderated by season. Possibly, these greater illuminance-induced benefits during the morning sessions in autumn/winter compared to spring occurred due to increased responsiveness to bright light as a function of a relatively low prior light dose in autumn/winter. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Modern {{competitive}} {{electricity markets}} {{do not ask}} for power systems with the highest possible technical perfection, but for systems with the highest possible economic efficiency. Higher economic efficiency can only be achieved when accurate and flexible analysis tools are used. Thus, the modelling of reliability inputs, methodology applied in assessing supply reliability and {{the interpretation of the}} reliability outputs should be carefully considered in power system management. In order to relate investment costs to the resulting levels of supply reliability, it is required that supply reliability be quantified in a monetary way. This can be done by calculating the expected interruption costs. Interruption costs evaluation, however, cannot be done correctly in all cases by methods that are based on the commonly used average values. It is the objective of this thesis to find a new way of calculating interruption costs which would combine the precision of a probabilistic method with the flexibility and correctness of customer and interruption parameters. A new reliability worth index was found, based on customer and interruption parameters. This new index was called a Risk-based interruption cost (RBIC) index and is described in detail in this thesis. The technique applies a time-based probabilistic modelling approach to network reliability worth parameters. The approach uses probability distribution functions to model customer interruption costs (CICs) while taking into account <b>seasonal,</b> day-of-week and <b>time-of-day</b> infl uences. In addition, customer specific parameters - economic activity, energy consumption, turnover and power interruption mitigation measures are used to segment electricity customers into customer cluster segments of similar cost profiles. Unlike the conventional deterministic approach, the new technique thus considers variability in CICs. The new model and methods to calculate the new reliability worth index have been implemented in a computer program and the accuracy of the calculation method was tested in various case studies and by comparison with the traditional average process. This research shows that probability density functions are superior to deterministic average values when modelling reliability worth parameters. Probability distribution functions reflect the variability in reliability worth parameters through their dispersion and skewness. Disregarding the effects of probability distribution of the interruption cost leads to large errors, up to 40 % and more, in the calculated expected interruption costs. The actual error in specific reliability worth calculations is hard to estimate. It is however clear that this error cannot be simply ignored. Furthermore, the risk-based approach applied to the interpretation of risk-based interruption cost (RBIC) index significantly influences the perception on the network's reliability performance. The risk-based approach allows the uncertainty allowed in a network planning or iv operation decision to be quantified. Use of the new reliability worth index offer more flexibility in reliability worth assessment and produce more accurate results. It can be used in all areas of power system reliability worth assessment which have always been exclusive domain of the average process...|$|R
