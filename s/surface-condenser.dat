40|$|A batch vacuum frying system, which {{processes}} {{fruits and}} vegetables, includes a frying pan, a <b>surface-condenser,</b> and a vacuum pump. With {{health and safety}} issues in mind, this research focused on developing a modified <b>surface-condenser</b> to prevent cavitation of the vacuum pump. The final oil-content was reduced by centrifugal de- oiling of the product under vacuum, which make the product healthier than what is currently available. The de-oiling mechanism consists of a centrifuge with a motor attached to the basket shaft, rotating up to 750 rpm (63 g units). The condenser consists of a (counter- flow) spiral-coil heat exchanger (SHE) connected to a refrigeration system that uses R 404 a refrigerant. De-oiling for 40 s at 300 and 750 RPM removed up to 67 % and 72 % of the chip?s surface oil, respectively. At 750 RPM for 10 s, 40 s, and 60 s the oil-content was reduced by 38 %, 44 %, and 51 %, respectively. The convective heat transfer coefficient (h) of the frying oil was determined at 120 ?C and 140 ?C using the lumped capacitance method. The h-values were 217 ? 13 W/m 2 K (120 ?C) and 258 ? 37 W/m 2 K (140 ?C) using a copper-ball thermocouple. The h- values increased to 3. 6 times during the boiling period. COMSOLTM Multiphysics was used to model the heat transfer in the vacuum fryer pan. Based on the simulation results, a 1. 5 cm thick insulation material was installed in the fryer to reduce the energy losses. The refrigeration system operates at Tevap = - 26 ?C and Tcond = 50 ?C with 26 ?C sub-cooling. Sensitivity analysis showed that the system Coefficient of Performance (COP) was about 3. 87 at these conditions and compressor power requirement (CPR) was 74 W (85 % efficiency) when frying 30 g of potatoes slices. The best results were obtained at Tevap = - 10 ?C and Tcond = 40 ?C with 26 ?C sub-cooling and superheat of 5 ?C. The predicted COP was 4 and the CPR 70 W. The ice-formation on coils reduced the condensation rate. Reducing the refrigerant temperature to - 10 ?C (from - 26 ?C) reduced the condensation rate by 30 %. These results show a more effective vacuum frying system for high-quality fruits and vegetables than the system previously used...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Parathion a d methyl {{parathion}} adsorbed at high loads on clays and similar surfaces exhibited properties of a bulk phase, {{such as a}} well-defined solubility and a characteristic X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern, {{different from those of}} the free substances. The aqueous olubility of parathion condensed at these surfaces was as low as 1. 2 #g/ml as compared to 14 tzg/ml for free parathion. The BET isotherm described the behavior of the investigated surface condensates even though these condensates were different from the multilayer adsorption for which the BET isotherm was originally developed. The XRD patterns of parathion and {{methyl parathion}} adsorbed on Na-bentonite exhibited reflections which were shifted towards higher angles as compared with the XRD patterns of the free compounds. This is in agreement with the lower solubility of the surface condensates. The properties of these condensates were easily controlled by the choice of adsorbent as well as by the choice of conditions under whch they were prepared. The existence of such <b>surface-condensed</b> phases and the manipulation of their properties can be utilized for the slow-release formulation of organophosphate esters which is important, for example, in pesticides application...|$|R

As at 1947, two hydraulic accumulators were located adjacent to the No.1 Dock hydraulic & electricity generating house and former Barry Rly Cos loco works, south-west of the dock, one at the junction of Subway Rd and the low-level docks through road and level crossing near what was the General HQ of the Barry Railway Co and what is now the Vale of Glamorgan Council Civil Office building, one north of the now removed New cut swingbridge and south of the former Graving Dock Junction & level crossing, one at the cross link road from Cadoxton to the Bendricks, north of No.2 dock and one at the foot of the steps of the former shortened and later removed Clive Rd, Barry Island footbridge to No.1 dock. Their function was to back up and stabilise fluctuating hydraulic pressure as the coal hoists and other users were working. Most of these were detectable from aerial photographs taken between 1921 and 1929 and can be seen on other websites.One pair of fixed coal hoists {{on the north side}} was 174 ft apart, and two pairs were 200 ft apart. This spacing was chosen since it was the same as that in the Cardiff docks, and ships had been built to match the spacing so they could be loaded at two positions simultaneously.|$|R
6000|$|Jim smiled {{without looking}} round. The skipper {{presented}} an unmoved breadth of back: {{it was the}} renegade's trick to appear pointedly unaware of your existence unless it suited his purpose to turn at you with a devouring glare before he let loose a torrent of foamy, abusive jargon that came like a gush from a sewer. Now he emitted only a sulky grunt; the second engineer {{at the head of}} the bridge-ladder, kneading with damp palms a dirty sweat-rag, unabashed, continued the tale of his complaints. The sailors had a good time of it up here, and what was the use of them in the world he would be blowed if he could see. The poor devils of engineers had to get the ship along anyhow, and they could very well do the rest too; by gosh they--'Shut up!' growled the German stolidly. 'Oh yes! Shut up--and when anything goes wrong you fly to us, don't you?' went on the other. He was more than half cooked, he expected; but anyway, now, he did not mind how much he sinned, because these last three days he had passed through a fine course of training for the place where the bad boys go when they die--b'gosh, he had--besides being made jolly well deaf by the blasted racket below. The durned, compound, <b>surface-condensing,</b> rotten scrap-heap rattled and banged down there like an old deck-winch, only more so; and what made him risk his life every night and day that God made amongst the refuse of a breaking-up yard flying round at fifty-seven revolutions, was more than he could tell. He must have been born reckless, b'gosh. He [...] . 'Where did you get drink?' inquired the German, very savage; but motionless in the light of the binnacle, like a clumsy effigy of a man cut out of a block of fat. Jim went on smiling at the retreating horizon; his heart was full of generous impulses, and his thought was contemplating his own superiority. 'Drink!' repeated the engineer with amiable scorn: he was hanging on with both hands to the rail, a shadowy figure with flexible legs. 'Not from you, captain. You're far too mean, b'gosh. You would let a good man die sooner than give him a drop of schnapps. That's what you Germans call economy. Penny wise, pound foolish.' He became sentimental. The chief had given him a four-finger nip about ten o'clock--'only one, s'elp me!'--good old chief; but as to getting the old fraud out of his bunk--a five-ton crane couldn't do it. Not it. Not to-night anyhow. He was sleeping sweetly like a little child, with a bottle of prime brandy under his pillow. From the thick throat of the commander of the Patna came a low rumble, on which the sound of the word schwein fluttered high and low like a capricious feather in a faint stir of air. He and the chief engineer had been cronies for a good few years--serving the same jovial, crafty, old Chinaman, with horn-rimmed goggles and strings of red silk plaited into the venerable grey hairs of his pigtail. The quay-side opinion in the Patna's home-port was that these two in the way of brazen peculation 'had done together pretty well everything you can think of.' Outwardly they were badly matched: one dull-eyed, malevolent, and of soft fleshy curves; the other lean, all hollows, with a head long and bony like the head of an old horse, with sunken cheeks, with sunken temples, with an indifferent glazed glance of sunken eyes. He had been stranded out East somewhere--in Canton, in Shanghai, or perhaps in Yokohama; he probably did not care to remember himself the exact locality, nor yet the cause of his shipwreck. He had been, in mercy to his youth, kicked quietly out of his ship twenty years ago or more, and it might have been so much worse for him that the memory of the episode had in it hardly a trace of misfortune. Then, steam navigation expanding in these seas and men of his craft being scarce at first, he had 'got on' after a sort. He was eager to let strangers know in a dismal mumble that he was 'an old stager out here.' When he moved, a skeleton seemed to sway loose in his clothes; his walk was mere wandering, and he was given to wander thus around the engine-room skylight, smoking, without relish, doctored tobacco in a brass bowl at the end of a cherrywood stem four feet long, with the imbecile gravity of a thinker evolving a system of philosophy from the hazy glimpse of a truth. He was usually anything but free with his private store of liquor; but on that night he had departed from his principles, so that his second, a weak-headed child of Wapping, what with the unexpectedness of the treat and the strength of the stuff, had become very happy, cheeky, and talkative. The fury of the New South Wales German was extreme; he puffed like an exhaust-pipe, and Jim, faintly amused by the scene, was impatient for the time when he could get below: the last ten minutes of the watch were irritating like a gun that hangs fire; those men did not belong to the world of heroic adventure; they weren't bad chaps though. Even the skipper himself [...] . His gorge rose at the mass of panting flesh from which issued gurgling mutters, a cloudy trickle of filthy expressions; but he was too pleasurably languid to dislike actively this or any other thing. The quality of these men did not matter; he rubbed shoulders with them, but they could not touch him; he shared the air they breathed, but he was different. [...] . Would the skipper go for the engineer? [...] . The life was easy and he was too sure of himself--too sure of himself to [...] . The line dividing his meditation from a surreptitious doze on his feet was thinner than a thread in a spider's web.|$|R
