The mechanical and the dielectric response at the glass transition (a relaxation) exhibit similar temperature dependence of the relaxation time, whereas mechanical and dielectric processes above the glass transition are not related. They represent a continuous softening process within the amorphous phase and the dielectric c relaxation, respectively. The latter is attributed to conformational changes of VDF segments in lamellae of spherulites constituting the nonpolar crystalline phase. Furthermore, there is a contribution from melting of secondary crystallites formed in the amorphous phase during annealing or storage. Mecha nically, this transition appears in nonstretched and <b>stretched</b> <b>films</b> as an accelerated decrease of the elastic modulus that terminates the rubber plateau. Dielectrically, this transition becomes visible as a frequency-independent loss peak only in <b>stretched</b> <b>films,</b> because <b>stretching</b> removes the c relaxation, which superimposes the transition in nonstretched films. Melting of secondary crystallites is shown to appear in the homopolymer, too, though less pronounced because of more complete primary crystallisation...|$|R

40|$|Beta-phase poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VDF-HFP)) {{copolymer}} {{films were}} prepared by uniaxially stretching solution-cast or melt-quenched samples. Different preparation routes lead to different {{amounts of the}} crystalline alpha and beta phases in the films, as detected by means of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry. The beta phase is significantly enhanced in melt-quenched and <b>stretched</b> <b>films</b> in comparison to solution-cast and <b>stretched</b> <b>films.</b> This is particularly true for copolymer samples with higher HFP content. The beta-phase enhancement is also observed in ferroelectric-hysteresis experiments where a rather high polarization of 58 mC/m(2) was found on melt-quenched and stretched samples after poling at electric fields of 140 MV/m. After poling at 160 MV/m, one of these samples exhibited a piezoelectric d(33) coefficient as high as 21 pC/N. An electric-field-induced partial transition from the alpha to the beta phase was also observed on the melt-quenched and stretched samples. This effect leads to a further increase in the applications-relevant dipole polarization. Uniaxially <b>stretched</b> ferroelectric-polymer <b>films</b> are highly anisotropic.

40|$|The {{composition}} of baled silage on Irish farms frequently {{differs from that}} of comparable precision-chop silage. This paper concerns a field-scale study designed to investigate: (a) the effects of number of layers (2, 4, 6 or 8) of polyethylene <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> and the duration of storage (7 vs. 18 months) on the conservation characteristics of baled silage, and (b) the conservation characteristics of baled (4 layers of <b>stretch</b> <b>film)</b> and precision-chop silages. All silages were made following three durations of wilting (0, 24 or 48 h). Wilting restricted silage fermentation, with silage pH being highest (P< 0. 001) and the concentration of fermentation products lowest (P< 0. 001) for the 48 h wilt treatment. Wrapping bales in only 2 layers of polyethylene <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> resulted in extensive visible mould growth, but mould growth was practically eliminated by the application of 4 or more layers of film. Silage fermentation characteristics were generally improved by wilting, and by 4 compared to 2 layers of <b>stretch</b> <b>film.</b> Extending the storage duration of baled silage from 7 to 18 months reduced (P< 0. 001) the concentration of fermentation products and increased in-silo fresh weight losses (P< 0. 001) and visible mould growth. Whereas 4 layers of conventional <b>stretch</b> <b>film</b> are normally sufficient, 6 layers may be necessary to prevent mould growth when bales of unwilted silage are stored for a second season. Under good farm-management conditions differences observed between baled and precision-chop silages probably result mainly from differences in the concentration of dry matter in herbage at ensiling. peer-reviewe...|$|E

Plastic packages main function is to preserve food from spoilage by cutting off the contact with oxygen as it causes organisms to react with food, leading to deterioration and after some point, spoilage.

40|$|Azobenzene-containing {{elastomers}} {{have been}} synthesized {{for the first}} time. By free radical polymerization of methacrylate or acrylate-based monomers bearing an azobenzene moiety in solution with dissolved styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) triblock copolymer, azobenzene side-chain liquid crystalline polymer (SCLCP) was grafted on the rubbery polybutadiene (PB) central block of SBS. Similar to SBS, the resultant azobenzene SCLCP-grafted SBS was a thermoplastic elastomer, for which polystyrene (PS) cylindrical microdomains behave as physical cross-links. Three different azobenzene SCLCCs, differing in chain backbone or terminal group on the azobenzene moiety, were used to prepare azobenzene elastomers. Their thin films obtained from solution casting were transparent and could be repeatedly stretched at room temperature. Polarized UV-vis and infrared spectroscopy were used to investigate the coupling effects from film deformation and photoisomerization of azobenzene chromophore in the elastomer. <b>Stretching</b> the <b>film</b> effectively induces a long-range orientation of azobenzene mesogenic groups (in the trans form) along the strain direction due to the liquid crystalline nature of the azobenzene polymer. When the <b>stretched</b> <b>film</b> is exposed to polarized or unpolarized UV light (360 nm), the orientation of trans-azobenzene is erased {{as a result of}} the trans-to-cis photoisomerization that corresponds to a photochemical liquid crystal-to-isotropic phase transition. On polarized or unpolarized visible irradiation (440 nm), the cis-to-trans back-isomerization recovers the orientation of trams-azobenzene mesogens. This coupled mechanical and optical effect allows a reversible optical switching between orientation-on and orientation-off states to be realized on <b>stretched</b> <b>films.</b> The study shows that the azobenzene SCLCP grafted on SBS is important since its glass and mesophase transition temperatures determine greatly the degree of stretching induced orientation while its cis isomer concentration at the photostationary state affects the erasure of orientation on UV light irradiation. Moreover, experiments found no evidence of reorientation of azobenzene mesogens in <b>stretched</b> <b>films</b> under linearly polarized UV irradiation, but during the orientation recovery with linearly polarized visible light, a contribution from photoinduced orientation of azobenzene becomes significant...|$|R
