25|$|During this period, Deng Xiaoping's {{policies}} continued {{beyond the}} initial reforms. Controls on private businesses and government intervention continued to decrease, {{and there was}} small-scale privatization of state enterprises which had become unviable. A notable development was the decentralization of state control, leaving local provincial leaders to experiment with ways to increase economic growth and privatize the <b>state</b> <b>sector.</b> Township and village enterprises, firms nominally owned by local governments but effectively private, began to gain market share {{at the expense of}} the <b>state</b> <b>sector.</b> Conservative elder opposition, led by Chen Yun, prevented many major reforms which would have damaged the interests of special interest groups in the government bureaucracy. Corruption and increased inflation increased discontent, contributing to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and a conservative backlash after that event which ousted several key reformers and threatened to reverse many of Deng's reforms. However, Deng stood by his reforms and in 1992, he affirmed the need to continue reforms in his southern tour. He also reopened the Shanghai Stock Exchange closed by Mao 40 years earlier.|$|E

40|$|Inequality {{reduction}} {{in general and}} income inequality {{reduction in}} particular has occupied huge efforts/resources of the state since independence in India. Given that more than 300 million people are under poverty line in India today and the sheer deprivation that they face, evaluation of inequality reduction methods in India assume greater significance. In the above context, the present paper {{is an attempt to}} understand the effectiveness of income inequality reduction methods by the <b>state,</b> third <b>sector</b> and the combined intervention of the <b>state</b> and third <b>sector.</b> For this purpose four villages in the Gulbarga district of Karnataka were chosen to assess the relative effectiveness of the interventions by <b>state,</b> third <b>sector</b> and the combined interventions of <b>state</b> and third <b>sector.</b> The results of the study show that, Combined intervention of the <b>State</b> and Third <b>Sector</b> on Income inequalities through SHGs is distinctly better in providing regular employment to employed people than other types of intervention. Combined intervention of <b>State</b> and Third <b>Sector</b> in Income inequalities is distinctly better both in empowering people with higher incomes and discouraging people from borrowing money from money lenders at very high interest rates. It could also be concluded that combined intervention of <b>State</b> and Third <b>Sector</b> provides better terms of borrowing than State intervention alone or Third Sector intervention alone. Earning and saving patters are much better in combined intervention of <b>State</b> and Third <b>Sector</b> than other interventions...|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s, the {{population}} increased by 15% and national income increased {{at an annual}} rate of about 4%. Employment increased by around 1% per year, but the <b>state</b> <b>sector</b> amounted to a large part of that. Public sector employment was a third of the total workforce by 1980. Budget deficits and public debt increased, leading to the crisis in the 1980s. During the 1980s, underlying economic problems became pronounced. Middle income workers were taxed 60% of their marginal income, unemployment had risen to 20%, annual overseas emigration reached over 1% of population, and public deficits reached 15% of GDP.|$|E
25|$|France has a {{mixed economy}} that {{combines}} extensive private enterprise with substantial state enterprise and government intervention. The government retains considerable influence over key segments of infrastructure sectors, with majority ownership of railway, electricity, aircraft, nuclear power and telecommunications. It has been relaxing its control over these sectors {{since the early}} 1990s. The government is slowly corporatising the <b>state</b> <b>sector</b> and selling off holdings in France Télécom, Air France, {{as well as in}} the insurance, banking, and defence industries. France has an important aerospace industry led by the European consortium Airbus, and has its own national spaceport, the Centre Spatial Guyanais.|$|E
25|$|Because the Rehn-Meidner model allowed capitalists owning very {{productive}} and efficient firms to retain excess profits {{at the expense}} of the firms' workers, thus exacerbating inequality, workers in these firms began to agitate for a share of the profits in the 1970s, just as women working in the <b>state</b> <b>sector</b> began to assert pressure for better wages. Meidner established a study committee that came up with a 1976 proposal that entailed transferring the excess profits into investment funds controlled by the workers in the efficient firms, with the intention that firms would create further employment and pay more workers higher wages, rather than increasing the wealth of company owners and managers. Capitalists immediately distinguished this proposal as socialism, and launched an unprecedented opposition—including calling off the class compromise established in the 1938 Saltsjöbaden Agreement.|$|E

25|$|It {{was hoped}} that the nationalizations of the 1970s would help develop the economy, but it {{remained}} in a very poor condition, with the <b>state</b> <b>sector</b> being plagued by inefficiency and corruption. Kérékou began reversing course in the early 1980s, closing down numerous state-run companies and attempting to attract foreign investment. He also accepted an IMF structural readjustment programme in 1989, agreeing to austerity measures that severely cut state expenditure. The economic situation continued to worsen during the 1980s, provoking widespread unrest in 1989. A student strike began in January of that year; subsequently strikes among various elements of society increased in frequency {{and the nature of}} their demands grew broader: whereas initially they had focused on economic issues such as salary arrears, this progressed to include demands for political reform.|$|E
25|$|In the pre-reform era, {{government}} {{was funded by}} profits from state-owned enterprises, much like the Soviet Union. As the <b>state</b> <b>sector</b> fell in importance and profitability, government revenues, especially that {{of the central government}} in Beijing, fell substantially and the government relied on a confused system of inventory taxes. Government revenues fell from 35% of GDP to 11% of GDP in the mid-1990s, excluding revenue from state-owned enterprises, with the central government's budget at just 3% of GDP. The tax system was reformed in 1994 when inventory taxes were unified into a single VAT of 17% on all manufacturing, repair, and assembly activities and an excise tax on 11 items, with the VAT becoming the main income source, accounting for half of government revenue. The 1994 reform also increased the central government's share of revenues, increasing it to 9% of GDP.|$|E
25|$|The Labour-led {{government}} under Helen Clark from 1999 to 2008 pursued a programme of public broadcasting reforms. New Zealand's wide-ranging adoption of neoliberal {{policies in the}} mid-1980s and 1990s had large sections of the <b>state</b> <b>sector</b> privatised. As a state owned enterprise, TVNZ enjoyed enormous commercial success (sustaining two-thirds of the overall audience share) and paid the Crown substantial dividends (over $250million between 1989 and 1999). However, the commercial success had been achieved through an unabashed pursuit of ratings through populist and tabloid content, and prior to the 1999 election the National-led government was evidently positioning TVNZ for privatisation Labour-led administrations since 1999 explicitly recognised the market failures of a wholly commercial broadcasting sector (e.g. saturation-level advertising, low levels of local content, heavy reliance on cheap imports and a disregard for quality genres and in-depth news and current affairs) and re-emphasised television's cultural and democratic functions in their policy thinking.|$|E
