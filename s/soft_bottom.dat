25|$|Intertidal ecology is {{the study}} of {{ecosystems}} between the low- and high-water lines along a shore. At low water, the intertidal zone is exposed (or emersed), whereas at high water, it is underwater (or immersed). Intertidal ecologists therefore study the interactions between intertidal organisms and their environment, as well as among the different species. The most important interactions may vary according to the type of intertidal community. The broadest classifications are based on substrates — rocky shore or <b>soft</b> <b>bottom.</b>|$|E
25|$|Different {{methods of}} bivalve {{collection}} are used {{depending on the}} site characteristics. A bivalve dredge is used in water deeper than 2 m, stainless steel tongs are used in 2-2.5 m deep water with a <b>soft</b> <b>bottom,</b> stainless steel pitch forks or quahog rakes are used in water less than 1 m deep, and collection by hand is done at some shoreline sites. The bivalves are then cleaned, packed in iced containers, and shipped to the appropriate analytical laboratory within two days of collection.|$|E

40|$|Fish fauna {{inventories}} (497 spp. in total) from {{coral reefs}} (276 spp.), <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms</b> (287 spp.) and mangrove (75 spp.) of Saint-Vincent Bay (New Caledonia) are compared. Each of these habitats present a distinct fish assemblage, coral reefs being characterized by grazers and omnivores, <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms</b> by small carnivores and mangroves by detritus feeders and piscivores. The overlap was most important between coral reefs and <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms</b> (101 spp. in common), #Chaetodontidae, Pomacentridae, Lethrinidae$ and #Lutjanidae$ being the main common families. Overlap between <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms</b> and mangrove was of 36 species, essentially #Leiognathidae, Lutjanidae$ and #Sphyraenidae$. There {{was almost no}} overlap between coral reefs and mangrove (13 species, 9 being ubiquitous). These results and a literature survey indicate that in the Indo-Pacific they are few interactions between coastal fish communities which may be essentially self sufficient. Died feeding migrations and juvenile migrations would be the main active energy flows, nevertheless, the fluxes seem to be limited. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGrowth of the {{invasive}} algae var. {{in shallow}} habitats {{may influence the}} faunal assemblage composition. We studied its effects on caprellid assemblages associated with shallow-water habitats of hard and <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms</b> from the SE Iberian Peninsula (native rocky-bottom algae, from hard and <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms,</b> and, and from <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms).</b> Samples were taken in two different sampling periods (September 2004 and March 2005). A total of seven caprellid species were identified, with important differences in their distribution in different habitats. Total abundance of caprellids was very high in March on native algae on hard bottoms, and on on both <b>soft</b> and hard <b>bottoms.</b> On both hard and <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms,</b> abundances of recorded from were low. On the other hand, a higher abundance of other species, namely,, and, was recorded from. The results indicate that may have {{a positive influence on}} some caprellid species, while seasonal changes are also evident. It is concluded that introduced may serve as a new habitat, promoting and maintaining caprellid populations in shallow Mediterranean habitats...|$|R

25|$|Where {{the towers}} are founded on {{underwater}} piers, caissons are sunk and any <b>soft</b> <b>bottom</b> is excavated for a foundation. If the bedrock is too deep {{to be exposed}} by excavation or the sinking of a caisson, pilings are driven to the bedrock or into overlying hard soil, or a large concrete pad to distribute the weight over less resistant soil may be constructed, first preparing the surface with a bed of compacted gravel. (Such a pad footing can also accommodate the movements of an active fault, {{and this has been}} implemented on the foundations of the cable-stayed Rio-Antirio bridge.) The piers are then extended above water level, where they are capped with pedestal bases for the towers.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the most}} ancient and {{primitive}} sharks is Cladoselache, from about 370 million years ago, which has been found within Paleozoic strata in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. At that point in Earth's history these rocks made up the <b>soft</b> <b>bottom</b> sediments of a large, shallow ocean, which stretched across much of North America. Cladoselache was only about [...] long with stiff triangular fins and slender jaws. Its teeth had several pointed cusps, which wore down from use. From {{the small number of}} teeth found together, it is most likely that Cladoselache did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks. Its caudal fins had a similar shape to the great white sharks and the pelagic shortfin and longfin makos. The presence of whole fish arranged tail-first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Growth of the {{invasive}} algae Caulerpa race-mosa var. cylindracea {{in shallow}} habitats may inXuence the faunal assemblage composition. We studied its eVects on caprellid assemblages associated with shallow-water habi-tats of hard and <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms</b> from the SE Iberian Peninsula (native rocky-bottom algae, C. racemosa from hard and <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms,</b> and Caulerpa prolifera, Cymodocea nodosa and Posidonia oceanica from <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms).</b> Samples {{were taken in}} two diVerent sampling periods (September 2004 and March 2005). A total of seven caprellid species were identiWed, with important diVerences in their distribution in diVerent habitats. Total abundance of caprellids was very high in March on native algae on hard bottoms, and on C. racemosa on both <b>soft</b> and hard <b>bottoms.</b> On both hard and <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms,</b> abundances of Caprella hirsuta recorded from C. racemosa were low. On the other hand, a higher abundance of other species, namely C. acanthifera, C. sant-osrosai, Phtisica marina and Pseudoprotella phasma, was recorded from C. racemosa. The results indicate that C. racemosa may have a positive inXuence on some caprel-lid species, while seasonal changes are also evident.

Two men in each canoe, and facing each other, then vigorously twist and churn about the pole, or rather stick, into the <b>soft</b> <b>bottom</b> of the lagoon. Some fifteen of these poles are thus driven in and firmly braced together by cross-pieces, upon which the platform is constructed, and on this again the house is built.|$|E

40|$|The {{echinoderm}} fauna of North-eastern Atlantic {{is one of}} {{the best}} known worldwide. However, despite a great number of published works on Atlantic echinoderms, this group remains poorly know in Northwest African waters, where the available information basically comes from the old oceanographic expeditions carried out from the late 19 th- to mid- 20 th centuries (Challenger, Prince Albert I of Monaco, Travailleur et Talisman, Michael Sars, Valdivia, Atlantide). During the four multidisciplinary Maurit surveys, carried out annually from 2007 to 2010 onboard R/V Vizconde de Eza in Mauritanian EEZ, between Cape Blanc (21 ° N) and the Senegalese border (16 ° N), a total of 342 trawling stations were sampled between 79 and 1867 m depth. Most of stations were located in <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms</b> and were accomplished with a commercial trawl and a beam-trawl. Only 26 stations were deployed in hard bottoms, namely canyons borders, the giant cold-water coral reef and a seamount, using a rock dredge. This paper deals with the echinoderms obtained in these surveys and compares soft-bottoms and hard bottom assemblages. Echinoderms were collected in 271 stations (79. 2 %) of which 252 (93. 0 %) were located in <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms</b> and only 19 (7. 0 %) in hard substrata. Global diversity reaches 100 species identified in both soft and hard substrata, including 29 Holothuroidea, 28 Asteroidea, 27 Ophiuroidea, 13 Echinoidea and 3 Crinoidea. Eighty-two species were collected on <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms,</b> 25 were collected on hard substrata, but only six were reported in both. Ophiuroidea and Asteroidea were the most diverse echinoderms found on <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms,</b> versus Holothuroidea and Ophiuroidea in hard bottoms. Nevertheless, numerically the <b>soft</b> <b>bottoms</b> assemblages were clearly dominated by deposit-feeder Holothuroidea, while the dominance in hard bottoms is mostly suspension-feeder Holothuroidea (Dendrochirotida) and Ophiuroidea...|$|R

The alluvial coast having no distinguishing marks, the bearings of the crossing-place had to be taken from the shape of the mountains inland.

In this veil of light the near edge of the shore alone stood out almost coal-black with an opaque and motionless solidity. Thirty miles away the serrated range of the interior stretched across the horizon, its outlines and shades of blue, faint and tremulous like a background painted on airy gossamer on the quivering fabric of an impalpable curtain let down to the plain of alluvial soil; and the openings of the estuary appeared, shining white, like bits of silver let into the square pieces snipped clean and sharp out of the body of the land bordered with mangroves.|$|E
