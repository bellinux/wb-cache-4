25|$|The spherical {{harmonics}} {{turn out to}} be critical to practical solutions of Laplace's equation. Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates, such as are used for mapping the sky, can be <b>simplified,</b> <b>using</b> the method of separation of variables into a radial part, depending solely on distance from the centre point, and an angular or spherical part. The solution to the spherical part of the equation can be expressed as a series of Laplace's {{spherical harmonics}}, simplifying practical computation.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} the complex {{interactions}} between inhibitory and excitatory neurons can be <b>simplified</b> <b>using</b> mean field theory, which {{gives rise to the}} population model of neural networks. While many neurotheorists prefer such models with reduced complexity, others argue that uncovering structural functional relations depends on including as much neuronal and network structure as possible. Models of this type are typically built in large simulation platforms like GENESIS or NEURON. There have been some attempts to provide unified methods that bridge and integrate these levels of complexity.|$|E
