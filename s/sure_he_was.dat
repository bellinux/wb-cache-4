5|$|Various biographers have {{proposed}} that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. Charles Darwin's illness caused repeated delays. His paper on Glen Roy had proved embarrassingly wrong, {{and he may have}} wanted to be <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> correct. David Quammen has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.|$|E
5|$|Verdi paid close {{attention}} to his financial contracts, making <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> appropriately remunerated as his popularity increased. For I Lombardi and Ernani (1844) in Venice he was paid 12,000 lire (including supervision of the productions); Attila and Macbeth (1847), each brought him 18,000 lire. His contracts with the publishers Ricordi in 1847 were very specific about the amounts he was to receive for new works, first productions, musical arrangements, and so on. He began to use his growing prosperity to invest in land near his birthplace. In 1844 he purchased Il Pulgaro, 62 acres (23 hectares) of farmland with a farmhouse and outbuildings, providing a home for his parents from May 1844. Later that year, he also bought the Palazzo Cavalli ({{now known as the}} Palazzo Orlandi) on the via Roma, Busseto's main street. In May 1848, Verdi signed a contract for land and houses at Sant'Agata in Busseto, which had once belonged to his family. It was here he built his own house, completed in 1880, now known as the Villa Verdi, where he lived from 1851 until his death.|$|E
5|$|Former British {{soldier and}} writer Ken Wharton {{published}} {{in his book}} Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1, an alternative theory that was suggested to him by loyalist paramilitarism researcher Jeanne Griffin; this was that the ambush was planned by Robin Jackson as an elaborate means of eliminating trumpet player Brian McCoy. Griffin suggests that McCoy, who originally came from Caledon, County Tyrone and had strong UDR and Orange Order family connections, was possibly approached at some stage by Jackson {{with a view of}} securing his help in carrying out UVF attacks in the Irish Republic. When McCoy refused, Jackson then hatched his plan to murder McCoy and his bandmates in retaliation, even macabrely choosing Buskhill as the ambush site due to its similarity to Bus-kill. Griffin goes on to add that the bogus checkpoint was set up not only to plant the bomb on board the van but to ensure the presence of McCoy which would have been confirmed when he handed over his driver's license to the gunmen. She also thinks that had everything gone to plan once the bomb was planted in the van McCoy would have been instructed to drive through Newry where the bomb would have gone off and the UVF could then afterwards portray the Miami Showband as IRA members on a mission to blow up the local RUC barracks. Griffin based her theory on the nine bullets that were fired from a Luger into McCoy's body and that Jackson's fingerprints were found on the silencer used for a Luger. She furthermore opined that Jackson was the man Travers saw kicking McCoy's body to make <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dead.|$|E

When they had enough evidence to arrest him, they planned to catch him {{in the act of}} running Silk Road, with his computer on and logged in.

25|$|Milligan blamed his {{breakdown}} and {{the collapse}} of his first marriage on the sheer volume of writing the show required. His then ground-breaking use of sound effects also contributed to the pressure. All this exacerbated his mental instability that included bipolar disorder, especially during the third series. The BBC however made <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> surrounded by accomplished radio comedy writers—Sykes, Stephens, Antrobus, Wiltshire, and Grafton—so many of the problems caused by his ill health were skilfully covered over by composite scripts written in a very convincing Milliganesque style.|$|E
25|$|Believing Epenow's fabrication, Gorges {{commissioned}} a voyage to Martha's Vineyard in 1614 under Captain Nicholas Hobson, accompanied by Epenow as a guide, translator, and pilot, {{together with his}} fellow captives Assacomet and Wanape. Wanape died soon after arriving in the New World. Upon arriving to Epenow's native island, the ship was peacefully greeted by a company of Wampanoags, including some of Epenow's brothers and cousins, whom Epenow quickly and quietly conspired with. Captain Hobson entertained the visitors to his ship, and invited them to return the next morning with trade goods. Not trusting Epenow, Hobson made <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> accompanied at all times by three guards, and clothed him with long garments that could be easily grabbed.|$|E

25|$|Gray's {{defenders}} {{would later}} argue that Gray simply practiced a management style {{that was different}} from that of Hoover. Gray's program of field office visits was something that Hoover had not done since his early years as director, and some felt Gray's visits did much to raise the morale of the agents working in those field offices. Furthermore, Gray's leadership style seemed to mirror what he had learned in the US Navy, in which the executive officer concentrates on the basic operation of the ship, while the captain concentrates on its position and heading. Felt believed Gray's methods were an unnecessary distraction and showed a lack of leadership. He was <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not {{the only one of the}} FBI leaders who disapproved of Gray's methods, particularly among those who had served under Hoover.|$|E
25|$|Claude {{was known}} as the singing killer. Keep in mind that there was another Claude Dubois at the time whose career was purely musical. Claude was a nightclub singer in his spare time and was {{acknowledged}} as the singer of the Montreal organization. When he was young he started out by working as a door-man for the Mafia, which gave him a foot in the door of the criminal underworld as the Cotroni began to weaken it allowed him to expand his work into strip clubs and bars. He ran his empire very efficiently and would insure regular meetings to make <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> on top of everything. Claude was very active in the downtown drug trafficking trade along with his brother Adrien. At the end of Claude’s career he was sentenced to 25 years for the murder of Cotroni’s brother-in-law in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Kelly {{was interviewed}} twice by his {{employers}} who {{concluded that they}} could not be <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Gilligan's only source. Eventually they took the decision to publicly acknowledge that an employee had come forward who might be the source. The announcement contained sufficient clues for alert journalists to guess Kelly's identity, and the Ministry of Defence confirmed the name when it was put to them. It usually refuses to comment on such matters, and it was alleged by some critics of the government that the Ministry of Defence was implementing a government decision to reveal Kelly's name as part of a strategy to discredit Gilligan. Andrew Rawnsley has claimed that Blair on 8 July sanctioned a strategy designed to reveal Kelly's identity; Lord Hutton found that the decision was only to confirm that a civil servant had come forward, without giving a name, because there was uncertainty that Kelly was in fact Gilligan's source.|$|E

25|$|According to his autobiography, Oh My, Dick Enberg (then {{the lead}} play-by-play voice for The NFL on NBC) was {{informed}} by NBC {{that he would}} become the lead play-by-play voice of the Major League Baseball Game of the Week beginning with the 1982 World Series (sharing the play-by-play duties for that game with Joe Garagiola, alongside analyst Tony Kubek) and through subsequent regular seasons. Enberg wrote that on his football trips, he would read every edition of The Sporting News to make <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> current with all the baseball news and notes. He then met with NBC executives in September 1982, who informed him that Vin Scully was in negotiations to be their lead baseball play-by-play announcer (teaming with Garagiola, while Kubek would team with Bob Costas) and would begin with the network {{in the spring of}} 1983. Therefore, rather than throw him in randomly for one World Series, Enberg wrote that he hosted the pre-game/post-game shows while the team of Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek did the games. According to the book, Enberg was not pleased about the decision (since he loved being the California Angels' radio voice in the 1970s and was eager to return to baseball) but the fact that NBC was bringing in Scully, arguably baseball's best announcer, was understandable. Enberg added that NBC also gave him a significant pay increase as a pseudo-apology for not coming through on the promise to make him the lead baseball play-by-play announcer.|$|E

500|$|Mitchell played {{baseball}} for the Bruins {{in the offseason}} prior to the 2000 football season. He was teammates with future Philadelphia Phillies second baseman Chase Utley and introduced Utley to his future wife, Jennifer Cooper. Mitchell was drafted in the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft in the 50th round by the Chicago White Sox. Utley said of Mitchell's decision not to play baseball professionally, [...] "he chose the right sport in football, that's for <b>sure.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a good batting practice hitter—that's about it. He wasn't quite the same once the game got going." [...] The Bruins earned the Pac-10 Conference Championship with Mitchell as a member in 2000.|$|E

500|$|Producer Bryan Singer {{originally}} {{demanded that}} an American actor {{play the role}} of House; according to Singer, the more foreign actors he watched audition for the part, the more <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> that an American was needed. At the time of casting, Hugh Laurie was filming the movie Flight of the Phoenix. He put together an audition tape in a Namibian hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light, and apologized for its appearance (which Singer compared to a [...] "bin Laden video"). Laurie improvised by using an umbrella for a cane. Singer was impressed by Laurie's performance and commented on how well the [...] "American actor" [...] grasped the character, not realizing Laurie was British.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 2004, agents working for Afghan {{intelligence}} determined that Bin Laden {{was living in}} a major settled area in Pakistan proper, rather than the semi-autonomous tribal areas on the Afghan-Pakistan border, Amrullah Saleh told The Guardian.

[...] "I was pretty <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in the settled areas of Pakistan because in 2005 it was still very easy to infiltrate the tribal areas, and we had massive numbers of informants there.

500|$|Bassist Stephen Travers {{was seriously}} wounded by a dum-dum bullet which had struck {{him when the}} gunmen had first begun shooting. He survived by pretending he was dead, as he lay beside the body of McCoy. Saxophone player Des McAlea was hit by the minibus's door when it was blown off in the explosion, but was not badly wounded. He lay hidden in thick undergrowth, undetected by the gunmen. He also survived. However, the flames from the burning hedge (which had been set on fire by the explosion) soon came dangerously close to where he lay; {{he was forced to}} leave his hiding spot. By this time the gunmen had left the scene, {{assuming}} everyone else had been killed. Travers later recalled hearing one of the departing gunmen tell his comrade who had kicked McCoy's body to make <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not alive: [...] "Come on, those bastards are dead. I got them with dum-dums". McAlea made his way up the embankment to the main road where he hitched a lift to alert the RUC at their barracks in Newry.|$|E

The ensuing [...] "Here Comes the Sun" [...] – the first live performance of the song, as for Harrison's other Beatle compositions played that day – was also warmly received. At this point, Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and, as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987, {{he looked down at}} the setlist taped to the body of the guitar and saw the word [...] "Bob" [...] followed by a question mark. [...] "And I looked around," [...] Harrison recalled of Bob Dylan's entrance, [...] "and he was so nervous – he had his guitar on and his shades – he was sort of coming on, coming ... It was only at that moment that I knew for <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to do it." [...] Among the audience, Schaffner wrote, there was [...] "total astonishment" [...] at this new arrival.|$|E
500|$|In early 2006, the Seneca Nation {{filed with}} the Securities and Exchange Commission to build the third of the three Western New York casinos that had been legislated in 2002. In 2007, Brown was not <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{in favor of the}} third casino, which seemed to cater to local {{residents}} instead of luring tourist revenues. Tom Golisano, founder of Paychex, former owner of the Buffalo Sabres National Hockey League franchise and three-time candidate for New York State Governor, suggested that the Buffalo economy would not benefit from a business designed to transfer money from local citizens to the Seneca Gaming Corporation. Brown withheld support while awaiting clarification of the target consumer for the third casino. In October 2006, the Seneca Nation and Brown came to terms on the final sale of a two-block stretch of city road that runs amid the [...] construction site. As part of the sale the nation agreed to both marketing terms (regarding marketing beyond the local region), and hiring preferences for city residents. However, in January 2007, a federal judge ruled that the granting of permission to run the third casino by the National Indian Gaming Commission was improper. Seneca Nation received federal approval for their casino on July 2, 2007 and opened the following day.|$|E
500|$|That same year, he {{fell out}} of a tree and broke his right hand. The injury forced him to play left-handed until his hand healed, making him {{effectively}} ambidextrous. In retrospect, he described this accident as [...] "a fortunate event" [...] and cited it {{as a factor in}} making him more versatile on the court. During a Press League game, the high school basketball coach saw him play. He was impressed by the budding star's two-handed ability and invited Cousy to come to practice the following day to try out for the junior varsity team. He did well enough to become a permanent member of the JV squad. He continued to practice day and night, and by his junior year was <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to be promoted to the varsity; but failing his citizenship course made him ineligible for the first semester. He joined the varsity squad midway through the season, however, scoring 28 points in his first game. He had no intention of attending college, but after he started {{to make a name for}} himself on the basketball court he started to focus on improving in both academics and basketball skills to make it easier for him to get into college.|$|E
