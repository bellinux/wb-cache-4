Seeking an alternative source of spice to break the Bene Gesserit monopoly, he meets with Uxtal, {{the last of the}} Lost Tleilaxu, hoping that he can rediscover the method of producing melange in axlotl tanks (a secret believed lost when the Bene Tleilax were destroyed by the Honored Matres). However, Uxtal is in the forced service of the Matre Superior Hellica; her price for his expertise is Edrik's help transporting a certain cargo. He agrees, delivering by heighliner the Obliterators that destroy the planet Richese, where the Bene Gesserit are mass-producing weapons and armed battleships. Uxtal is ultimately unsuccessful, but the ghola he creates of deceased Tleilaxu Master Waff later offers Edrik <b>something</b> <b>better</b> in exchange for sanctuary — the genetic knowledge for the Guild to create their own, optimized sandworms to produce melange.|$|E

25|$|Beatty {{was given}} orders {{to join the}} China Station in January 1886, but the posting did not appeal to his mother, who wrote to Lord Charles Beresford, then a senior naval officer, member of {{parliament}} and personal friend, to use his influence to obtain <b>something</b> <b>better.</b> Beatty was, in February 1886, instead appointed to HMS Alexandra, flagship of Admiral the Duke of Edinburgh, Queen Victoria's second son, who was Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Squadron. This proved an excellent social opening for Beatty, who established a longstanding relationship with the Duke's eldest daughter, Marie, and {{with other members of}} the court. Alexandra was a three-masted sailing ship with auxiliary steam power, nonetheless, remaining flagship in a navy which was steadily transitioning from sail to steam. Life in the Mediterranean fleet was considerably easier than cadet life, with visits to friendly ports all around the Mediterranean, but Beatty was concerned to work diligently towards naval examinations, which would determine seniority and future promotion prospects. Beatty was promoted to midshipman on 15 May 1886 and assigned to assist Lieutenant Stanley Colville on watchkeeping duties: Colville was to play an important part in Beatty's future career.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude.

Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

500|$|The early volumes, largely {{written by}} Leslie McFarlane, have been praised for their {{atmosphere}} and writing style, qualities often considered lacking in juvenile series books.

[...] The volumes not written by McFarlane or his wife were penned by John Button, who wrote the series from 1938 to 1942; this period is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Weird Period" [...] as the writing is full of inconsistencies and the Hardy Boys' adventures involve futuristic gadgetry and exotic locations.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{noted that}} the {{solution}} {{to some of the}} puzzles were unclear, further hindered by the planets' inhabitants, whose dialogue does not change when the planet's puzzle is completed. The tongue propulsion physics were said to be clumsy by StaceyG, who stated that, in conjunction with the gravity exerted by planets, it is more difficult to leave planets' surfaces than to navigate through space. Both Meer and StaceyG enjoyed the spacefaring aspect of the game, and Derek Yu of website TIGSource stated the controls [...] "sometimes felt brilliant, at other times felt unresponsive and awkward." [...] Patrick Dugan of Play This Thing saw potential in the tongue-swinging gameplay, noting that Aether appeared to be the first of a series.
