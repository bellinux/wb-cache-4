We also demonstrate that acetylation of lysine 320 (K 320) of p 53 is specifically involved in the promotion of neurite outgrowth and in the regulation of the expression of Coronin 1 b and Rab 13. Thus, in addition to its recognized role in neuronal apoptosis, <b>surprisingly,</b> <b>p</b> 53 is required for neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration, likely through a different post-translational pathway.

40|$|SummaryThe {{molecular}} basis for p 53 -mediated tumor suppression remains unclear. Here, to elucidate mechanisms of p 53 tumor suppression, we use knockin mice expressing an allelic series of p 53 transcriptional activation mutants. Microarray analysis reveals that one mutant, p 5325, 26, is severely compromised for transactivation of most p 53 target genes, and, moreover, p 5325, 26 cannot induce G 1 -arrest or apoptosis {{in response to}} acute DNA damage. <b>Surprisingly,</b> <b>p</b> 5325, 26 retains robust activity in senescence and tumor suppression, indicating that efficient transactivation {{of the majority of}} known p 53 targets is dispensable for these pathways. In contrast, the transactivation-dead p 5325, 26, 53, 54 mutant cannot induce senescence or inhibit tumorigenesis, like p 53 nullizygosity. Thus, p 53 transactivation is essential for tumor suppression but, intriguingly, in association with a small set of novel p 53 target genes. Together, our studies distinguish the p 53 transcriptional programs involved in acute DNA-damage responses and tumor suppression—a critical goal for designing therapeutics that block p 53 -dependent side effects of chemotherapy without compromising p 53 tumor suppression...|$|E

These data demonstrate for the first time that 32 P labelling is sufficient to induce a biologically-significant, p 53 -mediated cellular response and strongly suggest that it perturbs the phosphorylation state of p 53 which it is being used to measure.

In addition to sub-units of COX, some Cox 3 p intermediates contain Rcf 1 p, a protein associated with the super-complex that stabilizes the interaction of COX with the bc 1 (ubiquinol-cytochrome c re-ductase) complex. Finally, our results indicate that although assembly of the Cox 1 p module is not contingent on the presence of Cox 3 p, the converse is not true, as none of the Cox 3 p subassemblies were detected in a mutant blocked in translation of Cox 1 p.

40|$|The {{oxysterol}} binding protein homologue Kes 1 p {{has been}} implicated in nonvesicular sterol transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Kes 1 p also represses formation of protein transport vesicles from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) through an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that potential phospholipid translocases in the Drs 2 /Dnf family (type IV P-type ATPases [P 4 -ATPases]) are downstream targets of Kes 1 p repression. Disruption of KES 1 suppresses the cold-sensitive (cs) growth defect of drs 2 Δ, which correlates with an enhanced ability of Dnf P 4 -ATPases to functionally substitute for Drs 2 p. Loss of Kes 1 p also suppresses a drs 2 -ts allele in a strain deficient for Dnf P 4 -ATPases, suggesting that Kes 1 p antagonizes Drs 2 p activity in vivo. Indeed, Drs 2 -dependent phosphatidylserine translocase (flippase) activity is hyperactive in TGN membranes from kes 1 Δ cells and is potently attenuated by addition of recombinant Kes 1 <b>p.</b> <b>Surprisingly,</b> Drs 2 <b>p</b> also antagonizes Kes 1 p activity in vivo.

To understand the mechanism of ARF-mediated tumor suppression, we identified a ubiquitin ligase, ARF-BP 1, as a key factor associated with ARF in vivo. ARF-BP 1 harbors a signature HECT motif, and its ubiquitin ligase activity is inhibited by ARF.

40|$|As {{opposed to}} the vast {{majority}} of prokaryotic repressors, the immunity repressor of temperate Escherichia coli phage P 2 (C) recognizes non-palindromic direct repeats of DNA rather than inverted repeats. We have determined the crystal structure of P 2 C at 1. 8 [*]Å. This constitutes the first structure solved from the family of C proteins from P 2 -like bacteriophages. The structure reveals that the P 2 C protein forms a symmetric dimer oriented to bind the major groove of two consecutive turns of the DNA. <b>Surprisingly,</b> <b>P</b> 2 C has great similarities to binders of palindromic sequences. Nevertheless, the two identical DNA-binding helixes of the symmetric P 2 C dimer have to bind different DNA sequences. Helix 3 is identified as the DNA-recognition motif in P 2 C by alanine scanning and the importance for the individual residues in DNA recognition is defined. A truncation mutant shows that the disordered C-terminus is dispensable for repressor function. The short distance between the DNA-binding helices together with a possible interaction between two P 2 C dimers are proposed to be responsible for extensive bending of the DNA. The structure provides insight into the mechanisms behind the mutants of P 2 C causing dimer disruption, temperature sensitivity and insensitivity to the P 4 antirepressor...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe yeast AFG 3 gene encodes an ATP-dependent {{metalloprotease}} {{belonging to}} a subgroup of the AAA-family. This protease has been suggested to be essential for a metal- and ATP-dependent breakdown of incompletely mitochondrially synthesized polypeptides in the inner membrane, a process proposed to be important for mitochondrial function (Pajic et al. (1994) FEBS Lett. 353, 201 – 206). Here, we confirm the proteolytic activity by site-directed mutagenesis and demonstrate that the proteins Cox 1, Cox 3, Cob, Su 6, Su 8 and Su 9 are substrates of Afg 3 <b>p.</b> <b>Surprisingly,</b> this proteolytic activity is not required for respiratory function and thus presumably also not essential for mitochondrial biogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The DBP 5 gene encodes a {{putative}} RNA helicase {{of unknown}} {{function in the}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is shown here that Dbp 5 p is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase required for polyadenylated [poly(A) +] RNA export. <b>Surprisingly,</b> Dbp 5 <b>p</b> is present predominantly, if not exclusively, in the cytoplasm, and is highly enriched around the nuclear envelope. This observation {{raises the possibility that}} Dbp 5 p {{may play a role in}} unloading or remodeling messenger RNA particles (mRNPs) upon arrival in the cytoplasm and in coupling mRNP export and translation. The functions of Dbp 5 p are likely to be conserved, since its potential homologues can be found in a variety of eukaryotic cells...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The p 38 α Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) regulates stress- and inflammation-induced {{cellular}} responses. Factors {{implicated in}} the development of atherosclerosis including modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cytokines and even shear stress induce p 38 activation in endothelial cells and macrophages, which may be important for plaque formation. This study investigates the effects of endothelial- and macrophage-specific deficiency of p 38 α in atherosclerosis development, in Apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: ApoE(-/-) mice with macrophage or endothelial cell-specific p 38 α deficiency were fed a high cholesterol diet (HCD) for 10 weeks and atherosclerosis development was assessed by histological and molecular methods. <b>Surprisingly,</b> although <b>p</b> 38 α-deficiency strongly attenuated oxidized LDL-induced expression of molecules responsible for monocyte recruitment in endothelial cell cultures in vitro, endothelial-specific p 38 α ablation in vivo did not affect atherosclerosis development. Similarly, macrophage specific deletion of p 38 α did not affect atherosclerotic plaque development in ApoE(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: Although previous studies implicated p 38 α signaling in atherosclerosis, our in vivo experiments suggest that p 38 α function in endothelial cells and macrophages does not {{play an important role in}} atherosclerotic plaque formation in ApoE deficient mice...|$|R
