40|$|The {{ability to}} {{regulate}} forward speed {{is an essential}} capability for flying animals. Here, we use a dynamically scaled robot to gain insight into how flapping insects adjust stroke features to regulate and stabilize level forward flight. The results suggest that few changes to hovering kinematics are actually required to meet lift and thrust requirements, and the primary driver of equilibrium velocity is the aerodynamic pitch moment. This {{finding is consistent with}} prior hypotheses and observations regarding the relationship between body pitch and flight speed in fruit flies. We considered three different deformations of hovering wing kinematics, which were inspired by previous experimental studies and that result in the generation of a pitch moment: a shift in the mean <b>stroke</b> <b>position,</b> upstroke to downstroke differences in wing rotation angle, and upstroke to downstroke differences in stroke deviation. The results suggest that a shift in the mean <b>stroke</b> <b>position</b> is a likely candidate for trimming the pitch moment at all speeds, whereas shifts in the wing rotation angle are required only at high speeds. The results also show that the dynamics may be stabilized {{with the addition of a}} pitch damper, but the magnitude of required damping increases with flight speed. We posit that differences in stroke deviation between the upstroke and downstroke play a critical role in this stabilization. Fast mechanosensory feedback of the pitch rate enables active damping which becomes inherently gain scheduled with flight speed when pitch torque is generated by differences in deviation. This provides an elegant solution for flight stabilization across a wide range of flight speeds...|$|E

However, the shortcomings of small <b>positioning</b> <b>stroke</b> and hysteresis of piezoelectric actuators have constrained their further development and applications.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{regulate}} forward speed {{is an essential}} requirement for flying animals. Here, we use a dynamically-scaled robot to study how flapping insects adjust their wing kinematics to regulate and stabilize forward flight. The {{results suggest that the}} steady-state lift and thrust requirements at different speeds may be accomplished with quite subtle changes in hovering kinematics, and that these adjustments act primarily by altering the pitch moment. This finding is consistent with prior hypotheses regarding the relationship between body pitch and flight speed in fruit flies. Adjusting the mean <b>stroke</b> <b>position</b> of the wings is a likely mechanism for trimming the pitch moment at all speeds, whereas changes in the mean angle of attack may be required at higher speeds. To ensure stability, the flapping system requires additional pitch damping that increases in magnitude with flight speed. A compensatory reflex driven by fast feedback of pitch rate from the halteres could provide such damping, and would automatically exhibit gain scheduling with flight speed if pitch torque was regulated via changes in stroke deviation. Such a control scheme would provide an elegant solution for stabilization across a wide range of forward flight speeds...|$|E

Short sequences of serial sections of tips are examined in control (nonbeating) and activated (metachronal wave) preparations. Several different tip types, functional rather than morphogenetic variants, are demonstrated, but similarly bent cilia have similar tips. The peripheral filaments are composed of two subfibers: a and b. The bent regions of cilia are in the form of circular arcs, and apparent differences in subfiber-b length at the tip are those predicted solely by geometry of the stroke without the necessity of assuming filament contraction. Various subfibers b apparently move with respect to one another during beat, since small systematic variations in relative position can be detected from cilium to cilium. While subfiber-b lengths are uniform throughout, subfiber-a lengths are morphologically different for each filament: 8 and 3 are about 0. 8 µ longer than 1, 4 and 5, but each unique length is independent of <b>stroke</b> <b>position</b> or tip type. Subfiber-a does not contract, nor does it move, e. g. slide, with respect to subfiber-b of the same doublet. The central pair of filaments extends to the tip of the cilium where its members fuse. Subunit assembly in ciliary microtubules is evidently precise. This may be of importance in establishing the relationships needed for mechanochemical interactions that produce sliding and beat...|$|E

40|$|Using a "slit camera" {{recording}} technique, we {{have examined}} the effects of local laser irradiation of cilia of the gill epithelium of Mytilus edulis. The laser produces a lesion which interrupts epithelial integrity. In artificial sea water that contains high K+ or is effectively Ca++ free, metachronism of the lateral cilia continues to either side of the lesion with only minor perturbations in frequency synchronization and wave velocity, such as would be expected if metachronal wave coordination is mechanical. However, in normal sea water and other appropriate ionic conditions (i. e., where Ca++ concentration is elevated), in addition to local damage, the laser induces distinct arrest responses of the lateral cilia. Arrest is not mechanically coordinated, since cilia stop in sequence depending on <b>stroke</b> <b>position</b> as well as distance from the lesion. The velocity of arrest under standard conditions is about 3 mm/s, several orders of magnitude faster than spreading velocities associated with diffusion of materials from the injured region. Two responses can be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} kinetics of recovery of the arrested regions. These are (a) a nondecremental response that resembles spontaneous ciliary stoppage in the gills, and (b) a decremental response, where arrest nearer the stimulus point is much longer lasting. The slower recovery is often periodic, with a step size approximating lateral cell length. Arrest responses with altered kinetics also occur in laterofrontal cilia. The responses of Mytilus lateral cilia resemble the spreading ciliary arrest seen in Elliptio and arrest induced by electrical and other stimuli, and the decremental response may depend upon electrotonic spread of potential change produced at the stimulus site. If this were coupled to transient changes in Ca++ permeability of the cell membrane, a local rise in Ca++ concentration might inhibit ciliary beat at a sensitive point in the stroke cycle to produce the observed arrest...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that a quasi-steady model closely matches the instantaneous force produced by an insect wing during hovering flight. It is not clear, however, if such methods extend to forward flight. In this study we use a dynamically scaled robotic model of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the forces produced by a wing revolving at constant angular velocity while simultaneously translating at velocities appropriate for forward flight. Because the forward and angular velocities were constant wing inertia was negligible, and the measured forces can be attributed to fluid dynamic phenomena. The combined forward and revolving motions of the wing produce a time-dependent free-stream velocity profile, which suggests that added mass forces make a contribution to the measured forces. We find that the forces due added mass make a small, but measurable, component of the total force and are in excellent agreement with theoretical values. Lift and drag coefficients are calculated from the force traces after subtracting the contributions due to added mass. The lift and drag coefficients, for fixed angle of attack, are not constant for non-zero advance ratios, but rather vary in magnitude throughout the stroke. This observation implies that modifications of the quasi-steady model are required in order to predict accurately the instantaneous forces produced during forward flight. We show that the dependence of the lift and drag coefficients upon advance ratio and <b>stroke</b> <b>position</b> can be characterized effectively in terms of the tip velocity ratio – the ratio of the chordwise components of flow velocity at the wing tip due to translation and revolution. On this basis we develop a modified quasi-steady model that can account for the varying magnitudes of the lift and drag coefficients. Our model may also resolve discrepancies in past measurements of wing performance based on translational and revolving motion...|$|E
40|$|P/M NiTi for {{the test}} program was {{manufactured}} by the Special Metals powder metallurgy process and converted to wire by hot swaging and wire drawing. The mechanical test program was undertaken in order to investigate the performance of NiTi both for scientific reasons and for better understanding of material performance as it specifically pertains to shape memory effect (SME) devices. Two types of mechanical tests, monotonic deformation/recovery and thermomechanical cyclic deformation, were used to characterize performance. As anticipated, monotonic mechanical properties were equivalent to cast/wrought properties. Individual NiTi wire specimens were deformed in an incremental series up to 30 percent total engineering strain. These prestrained specimens followed three experimental thermal cycles which monitored deflection, load, and energy during the shape recovery-heating cycle. The aforementioned three techniques were used {{to provide a more}} complete understanding of the shape recovery response. Each measurement technique demonstrated a maximum in the recovery resulting from an 8 to 12 percent total input strain. Monotonic results indicate that the maximum recovery strain is a measure of SME capacity to provide a single output of deflection (or force), which are potentially useful data for SME devices performing monotonically. Thermomechanical testing was conducted using a servo-hydraulic test machine in conjunction with a controlled temperature environmental chamber in an attempt to simulate a cyclic SME device. After deformation to a predetermined strain, <b>stroke</b> <b>position</b> was held constant as the specimen was thermally cycled above Af and the resulting load was monitored (strain control). This test mode resulted in permanent damage and loss of SME with each thermomechanical cycle, manifested as a decrease in load and available work delivered by the specimen. In load control, the specimen was deformed to a predetermined strain, the load reduced, and maintained at approximately zero during the thermal cycle above Af. This load control technique proved to be much less damaging to the specimen. Load control testing was clearly the superior technique for evaluating performance of cyclic SME devices...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis was {{performed}} in collaboration with Öhlins Racing AB. The company provides suspension systems to the automotive industry and to motorsport teams globally. Many of Öhlins’ customers compete in rallycross, a style of competition that generally involves highly modified production cars racing on closed, elevated and mixed surfaced circuits. Rallycross cars generally have an inherent problem and tend to over rotate mid-air after taking off from a jump. The vehicle often lands with a large pitch angle, damaging suspension components or losing valuable time when the driver waits for the vehicle to settle. The request from Öhlins was to analyse this phenomenon. The scope of the master thesis was to; investigate four different simulation software and choose the most appropriate software to simulate a rallycross car, perform a parameter study to analyse which parameters affect the jumping behaviour of the vehicle and study the force build up in the suspension during the landing phase. The four simulation software investigated were LMS Amesim, CarSim, Adams/Car and a 2 D MATLAB model. The models were parameterised with vehicle data acquired from a rallycross car and validated against measured data obtained from tests with the same car. The MATLAB model {{was considered to be}} the best performing model given the criteria which were set up. A parameter study was conducted with the chosen simulation model where different vehicle parameters, driver behaviour and road profiles were analysed to investigate what impact they had on the jumping performance of the rallycross car. It could be concluded that the rear damper stiffness is critical for the jumping behaviour of the vehicle and that a stiffer rear damper generally gives the best performance. The longitudinal position of the centre of gravity also has a significant impact on vehicle jumping where a position in the middle between front and rear axle is preferred. The force build-up in the vehicle suspension was also analysed. Vehicle jumping and landing behaviour was compared to measurements from a human jumping in order to investigate if a human jumping utilised other force build-up strategies. It was found that the car force build-up during landing was similar to a human beings. Other force build-up strategies for the dampers were tested and it was found that dampers reacting to <b>stroke</b> <b>position</b> or hub acceleration can improve jumping performance of a rallycross car...|$|E
