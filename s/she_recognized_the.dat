500|$|Swift {{commenced}} composing [...] "White Horse" [...] {{almost a}} year before the release of Fearless, weeks after composing Fearless lead single [...] "Love Story", songs which are quite disparate lyrically. Swift first solely wrote the first verse. She then made a phone call to Liz Rose, co-writer of most tracks on Swift's eponymous debut studio album, Taylor Swift (2006), asking for her aid in finishing the song; the two completed writing the song in approximately forty-five minutes. The song was inspired by a boyfriend of Swift's who she perceived to be a Prince Charming and, in the downfall of the relationship, then realized he was not. She said he was the person who triggered the song, but, once in the midst of writing it, drifted in direction. It focused on the initial moment where <b>she</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> relationship was over. She said everything after that particular moment centered on recuperation and, because of that, considered it the most solemn aspect of a breakup: [...] "To me, 'White Horse' is about what, in my opinion, is the most heart-breaking part of a break-up – that moment when you realize that all the dreams you had, all those visions you had of being with this person, all that disappears." [...] About the difference in themes between [...] "White Horse" [...] and [...] "Love Story", Swift explained that in divergent scenarios, she regarded fairytales in different manners. She attributed the fact that because she did not expect to go through the event, then she became more inclined to come in terms with reality.|$|E
2500|$|As police {{descended on}} the neighborhood, a local woman walked up to MacArthur Boulevard {{to see what the}} commotion was about. She noticed the {{burgundy}} Buick, and recalled seeing Mixon in the car during the previous few days. She also knew that Mixon's sister lived in a two-bedroom, ground-level apartment at 2755 74th Avenue, just a block from where the motorcycle officers were shot. Although she knew her life would be in danger if she were labeled a [...] "snitch", the woman decided to give this information to an officer <b>she</b> <b>recognized.</b> <b>The</b> information was then relayed to Lieutenant Christopher Mufarreh, who was investigating Mixon's possible whereabouts independently, by an off-duty police lieutenant. Without consultation or coordination with his superiors, Mufarreh ordered a SWAT team to converge on the scene.|$|E

[...] Less than an hour before the stabbing, one of the five, Jason Holland, 18, grabbed a wallet from an unlocked vehicle {{in the parking lot of}} a public park, an act witnessed by the wallet's owner, a mother playing in the park with her children. Shortly thereafter, <b>she</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> truck and confronted the five, demanding and receiving her wallet back in the face of their threats and intimidation. [...] This theft and intimidation would be used to support the prosecution's contention that the five were still acting in concert at the time of the murder.|$|E
2500|$|Like most Mongol {{women of}} the time, Sorghaghtani wielded great {{authority}} at home.

Although she herself was illiterate, <b>she</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> value of literacy in running such a far-flung empire. [...] Each of her sons learned a different language for different regions. Sorghaghtani, a Nestorian Christian, respected other religions. Her sons, like Genghis, were all very liberal-minded in matters of religion, and the Mongol Empire promulgated the notion of state above religion while supporting all major religions of the time. Sorghaghtani also financed the construction of a madrasa in Bukhara and gave alms to both Christians and Muslims.|$|E
