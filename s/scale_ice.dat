40|$|This paper {{describes}} a validation procedure of the Mä ättänen-Blenkarn ice model for ice-structure interaction against <b>scaled</b> <b>ice</b> tank tests. The tests were {{performed at the}} Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA) where a simplified scaled model of the Norströmsgrund lighthouse was built. Several ice-structure interaction tests were performed with various ice thicknesses and velocities. The results of those experiments were compared against results of the numerical simulations performed at Fraunhofer IWES. A numerical model, based on the HSVA structure, was implemented in OneWind simulation tool for offshore wind turbines. The complex geometry of the physical structure was simplified to a single degree of freedom numerical model represented by a rigid beam, a spring and a damper. Its implementation was validated {{with a set of}} tests. The static behavior of the numerical structure was validated by a pullout test, whereas dynamic response was checked in terms of eigenfrequencies and a free decay test. These results fit very well to those obtained at HSVA with the physical structure. The original Mä ättänen -Blenkarn ice model could not be directly utilized for validation against the <b>scaled</b> <b>ice</b> tank tests as the relationship between stress and stress rate in the ice model was derived from the full-scale measurements. A new relationship between stress and stress rate for <b>scaled</b> <b>ice</b> was setup. After the tuning of the ice model a good match of simulated displacements, velocities and forces was achieved...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of tests at NASA Lewis to evaluate three <b>icing</b> <b>scaling</b> relationships or 'laws' for an unheated model. The laws were LWC x time = constant, one proposed by a Swedish-Russian group and one used at ONERA in France. Icing tests were performed in the NASA Lewis Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) with cylinders ranging from 2. 5 - to 15. 2 -cm diameter. Reference conditions were chosen to provide rime, mixed and glaze <b>ice.</b> <b>Scaled</b> conditions were tested for several scenarios of size and velocity scaling, and the resulting ice shapes compared. For rime-ice conditions, all three of the scaling laws provided <b>scaled</b> <b>ice</b> shapes which closely matched reference ice shapes. For mixed ice and for glaze ice none of the scaling laws produced consistently good simulation of the reference ice shapes. Explanations for the observed results are proposed, and scaling issues requiring further study are identified...|$|R

25|$|Over {{long time}} <b>scales,</b> <b>ice</b> sheet mass balance {{is governed by}} the amount of {{sunlight}} reaching the earth. This variation in sunlight reaching the earth, or insolation, over geologic time is in turn determined by the angle of the earth to the sun and shape of the Earth's orbit, as it is pulled on by neighboring planets; these variations occur in predictable patterns called Milankovitch cycles. Milankovitch cycles dominate climate on the glacial–interglacial timescale, but there exist variations in ice sheet extent that are not linked directly with insolation.|$|R

In April and May 1794, Dumas launched several assaults on Mont Cenis.

40|$|Previous {{studies showed}} that for {{conditions}} simulating an aircraft encountering super-cooled water droplets the droplets may splash before freezing. Other surface effects dependent on the water surface tension may also influence the ice accretion process. Consequently, the Weber number appears {{to be important in}} accurately <b>scaling</b> <b>ice</b> accretion. A <b>scaling</b> method which uses a constant-Weber-number approach has been described previously; this study provides an evaluation of this scaling method. Tests are reported on cylinders of 2. 5 to 15 -cm diameter and NACA 0012 airfoils with chords of 18 to 53 cm in the NASA Lewis Icing Research Tunnel (IRT). The larger models were used to establish reference <b>ice</b> shapes, the <b>scaling</b> method was applied to determine appropriate scaled test conditions using the smaller models, and the ice shapes were compared.

This {{is likely to be}} the result of a favorable configuration of the continents during this period that allowed for improved circulation in the oceans and discouraged the formation of large <b>scale</b> <b>ice</b> sheet.

40|$|During an icing {{encounter}} of {{an aircraft}} in flight, super-cooled water droplets impinging on an airfoil may splash before freezing. This paper reports tests performed {{to determine if}} this effect is significant and uses the results to develop an improved scaling method for use in icing test facilities. Simple laboratory tests showed that drops splash on impact at the Reynolds and Weber numbers typical of icing encounters. Further confirmation of droplet splash came from icing tests performed in the NaSA Lewis Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) with a surfactant added to the spray water to reduce the surface tension. The resulting ice shapes were significantly different from those formed when no surfactant {{was added to the}} water. These results suggested that the droplet Weber number must be kept constant to properly <b>scale</b> <b>icing</b> test conditions. Finally, the paper presents a Weber-number-based scaling method and reports results from scaling tests in the IRT in which model size was reduced up to a factor of 3. <b>Scale</b> and reference <b>ice</b> shapes are shown which confirm the effectiveness of this new scaling method...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study utilizing a remote controlled model helicopter {{has been conducted}} to measure the performance degradation due to simulated ice accretion {{on the leading edge}} of the main rotor for hover and forward flight. The 53. 375 inch diameter main rotor incorporates a NACA 0012 airfoil with a generic ice shape corresponding to a specified natural ice condition. Thrust coefficients and torque coefficients about the main rotor were measured as a function of velocity, main rotor RPM, angle-of-incidence of the fuselage, collective pitch angle, and extent of spanwise ice accretion. An experimental airfoil data bank has been determined using a two-dimensional twenty-one inch NACA 0012 airfoil with <b>scaled</b> <b>ice</b> accretion shapes identical to that used on the model helicopter main rotor.

5000|$|Swing saws {{are used}} to carve ice into blocks, taken from the frozen surface of the Songhua River. Chisels, ice picks and various types of saws are then used by ice sculptors to carve out large <b>scaled</b> <b>ice</b> sculptures, many of them {{intricately}} designed and worked on all day and night prior to the commencement of the festival. Deionised water can also be used, producing ice blocks as transparent as glass to make clear sculptures rather than translucent ones. Multicoloured lights are also used to give colour to ice, creating variations on sculptured spectacles when lit up especially at night. Some ice sculptures made in previous years include: buildings and monuments of different architectural types and styles, figures including animals people and mythical creatures, slippery dips or ice slides and lanterns.

50|$|The {{difference}} in global mean temperatures between a fully glacial Earth and an ice free Earth {{is estimated at}} approximately 10 °C, though far larger changes would be observed at high latitudes and smaller ones at low latitudes. One requirement {{for the development of}} large <b>scale</b> <b>ice</b> sheets seems to be the arrangement of continental land masses at or near the poles. The constant rearrangement of continents by plate tectonics can also shape long-term climate evolution. However, {{the presence or absence of}} land masses at the poles is not sufficient to guarantee glaciations or exclude polar ice caps. Evidence exists of past warm periods in Earth's climate when polar land masses similar to Antarctica were home to deciduous forests rather than ice sheets.|$|E
50|$|When an {{icebreaker}} is designed, one of {{the main}} goals is to minimize the forces resulting from crushing and breaking the ice, and submerging the broken floes under the vessel. The average value of the longitudinal components of these instantaneous forces is called the ship's ice resistance. Naval architects who design icebreakers use the so-called h-v-curve to determine the icebreaking capability of the vessel. It shows the speed (v) that the ship is able to achieve as a function of ice thickness (h). This is done by calculating the velocity at which the thrust from the propellers equals the combined hydrodynamic and ice resistance of the vessel. An alternative means to determine the icebreaking capability of a vessel in different ice conditions such as pressure ridges is to perform model tests in an ice tank. Regardless of the method, the actual performance of new icebreakers is verified in full <b>scale</b> <b>ice</b> trials once the ship has been built.|$|E
50|$|Before 1867, Cedar Lake {{had a much}} {{different}} shape, {{and most of the}} woods surrounding Hidden Beach, particularly to the south east, were areas of water and wetland instead. In 1867, the St. Paul & Pacific Railway (a precursor to the BNSF Railway) built an earthen causeway through what was then a large bay {{on the east side of}} Cedar Lake. In 1871, the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad joined the StP&P, running parallel tracks along the causeway. Slowly, by dumping cinders and other material, the part of the bay east of the causeway was filled in. The M&StL (the StP&P became the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba and moved its tracks from the east side to the north side of the lake 1883) then used the new land to create a major train yard. In 1878 a large <b>scale</b> <b>ice</b> cutting operation known as Cedar Lake Ice Company was founded on the lake’s north eastern shore, which shipped ice to places as far away as St. Louis.

40|$|Patterns of {{environmental}} spatial structure {{lie at the}} heart of the most fundamental and familiar patterns of diversity on Earth. Antarctica contains some of the strongest environmental gradients on the planet and therefore provides an ideal study ground to test hypotheses on the relevance {{of environmental}} variability for biodiversity. To answer the pivotal question - ‘How does spatial variation in physical and biological environmental properties across the Antarctic drive biodiversity?’ - we have synthesised current knowledge on environmental variability across terrestrial, freshwater and marine Antarctic biomes and related this to the observed biotic patterns. The most important physical driver of Antarctic terrestrial communities is the availability of liquid water, itself driven by solar irradiance intensity. Patterns of biota distribution are further strongly influenced by the historical development of any given location or region, and by geographical barriers. In freshwater ecosystems, free water is also crucial, with further important influences from salinity, nutrient availability, oxygenation, and characteristics of ice cover and extent. In the marine biome there does not appear to be one major driving force, with the exception of the oceanographic boundary of the Polar Front. At smaller spatial <b>scales,</b> <b>ice</b> cover, ice scour and salinity gradients are clearly important determinants of diversity at habitat and community level. Stochastic and extreme events remain an important driving force in all environments, particularly in the context of local extinction and colonization or recolonization as well as that of temporal environmental variability.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a problem of {{transient}} temperature measurements performed on the airfoil exposed to icing conditions. Two types of investigations are discussed: in-flight tests and laboratory icing experiments in a wind tunnel. In the first case measurements were performed during test flights of the Polish TS- 11 „Iskra ” jet plane. A specially designed on board temperature measurement system was utilised to record the temperature changes in five selected points at the wing. Experiments of the second kind were performed on the NACA 0012 model airfoil in a small <b>scale</b> <b>icing</b> research tunnel. In this case a multichannel temperature measurement laboratory system was applied. The experiments were focused on the icing phenomena investigations. The obtained results were analysed {{in view of the}} supercooled fuel effect on the heat transfer and on temperature distribution. The aircraft icing phenomena still attain great attention [1], [2]. It is mostly because the aircraft icing may pose a severe hazard to life and because the removal and prevention of ice formation on aircraft components is vital to aircraft performance and operation. The intense ice accretion may lead to deterioration in aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft, increase of its mass and shifting of the mas...|$|R
