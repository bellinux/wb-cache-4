There is also a <b>short</b> <b>code</b> in the United Kingdom which is only accessible to those on the Vodafone, O2 and Orange networks.

25|$|In astronomy, stellar {{classification}} is {{the classification}} of stars based on their spectral characteristics. Electromagnetic radiation from the star is analyzed by splitting it with a prism or diffraction grating into a spectrum exhibiting the rainbow of colors interspersed with absorption lines. Each line indicates an ion of a certain chemical element, with the line strength indicating the abundance of that ion. The relative abundance of the different ions varies with {{the temperature of the}} photosphere. The spectral class of a star is a <b>short</b> <b>code</b> summarizing the ionization state, giving an objective measure of the photosphere's temperature and density.|$|E

2500|$|Code signing uses public-key {{infrastructure}} to check if a file has been modified since being digitally signed by its publisher. Alternatively, a system owner or administrator {{can use a}} cryptographic hash function to compute a [...] "fingerprint" [...] at installation time that can help to detect subsequent unauthorized changes to on-disk code libraries. However, unsophisticated schemes check only whether the code has been modified since installation time; subversion prior to that time is not detectable. The fingerprint must be re-established each time changes are made to the system: for example, after installing security updates or a service pack. The hash function creates a message digest, a relatively <b>short</b> <b>code</b> calculated from each bit in the file using an algorithm that creates large changes in the message digest with even smaller changes to the original file. By recalculating and comparing the message digest of the installed files at regular intervals against a trusted list of message digests, changes in the system can be detected and monitored—as long as the original baseline was created before the malware was added.|$|E

50|$|SMS {{marketing}} services typically run off a <b>short</b> <b>code,</b> but sending text messages to an {{email address is}} another methodology (though this method is {{not supported by the}} carriers). Short codes are 5 or 6 digit numbers that have been assigned by all the mobile operators in a given country especially for the use of brand campaign and other consumer services. Due to the high price of short codes of $500-$1000 a month, many small businesses opt to share a <b>short</b> <b>code</b> in order to reduce monthly costs. The mobile operators vet every <b>short</b> <b>code</b> application before provisioning and monitor the service to make sure it does not diverge from its original service description. Another alternative to sending messages by <b>short</b> <b>code</b> or email is to do so through one's own dedicated phone number.|$|E
