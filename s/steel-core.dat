25|$|Violins are tuned {{by turning}} the pegs in the pegbox under the scroll, or by {{adjusting}} the fine tuner screws at the tailpiece. All violins have pegs; fine tuners (also called fine adjusters) are optional. Most fine tuners consist of a metal screw that moves a lever attached to the string end. They permit very small pitch adjustments much more easily than the pegs. By turning one clockwise, the pitch becomes sharper (as the string is under more tension) and turning one counterclockwise, the pitch becomes flatter (as the string is under less tension). Fine tuners on {{all four of the}} strings are a practical necessity for playing <b>steel-core</b> strings, and some players use them with synthetic strings as well. Since modern E strings are steel, a fine tuner is typically fitted for that string. Fine tuners are not used with gut strings, which are more elastic than steel or synthetic-core strings and do not respond adequately to the very small movements of fine tuners.|$|E

50|$|An {{improved}} version {{called the}} QBZ-95-1 was first seen undergoing trials in early 2010. The first formal {{public display of}} the improved version was with the Hong Kong Garrison, the first unit to receive the original QBZ-95, in a military parade in July 2012. Some improvements were ergonomic, with the safety switch moved to above the pistol grip and the right-sided ejection port moved forward with ejection of cartridges {{at an angle to}} allow left-handed firing. Unlike previous DBP87 and DBP85 5.8×42mm rounds, it fires better quality DBP10 ammunition with a non-corrosive primer, clean-burning propellant, and copper-coated steel casing with a copper-alloy-jacketed hardened <b>steel-cored</b> bullet. The QBZ-95-1 has a longer, heavier barrel and redesigned muzzle brake, a diamond-shaped cross-section on the handguard to disperse heat, a stronger buttstock and a redesigned trigger guard. The carrying handle was lowered to better position optics on the quick-releasable modified dovetail rail, and a pair of short rails at the sight's base allows for tactical accessories to be mounted.|$|R

Major improvements include a non-corrosive primer, a copper-coated steel case with a copper alloy bullet jacket with a 3.8 mm diameter hardened steel core for better penetration of (body) armor. It also uses a cleaner burning propellant {{so as not to}} leave residue inside the weapon after firing.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a development case of robotic machine for {{the dismantling of}} steel-concrete structures using diamond wire technology. The {{focus is on the}} application of the so called soft-wire with core made of superelastic alloy in place of the steel rope traditionally used. Remote-controlled machinery operating in risky areas must be the simplest possible for reliability and to shorten the development time as generally these machines are tailored to the task. In the case of dismantling of nuclear equipment there are two additional reasons to prefer simple designs: The need to decommission the cutting machinery together with the nuclear wastes and the limit to the use of electronics onboard due to radiation. With <b>steel-cored</b> cutting wires an active tensioner is needed to compensate for tension shocks occurring during cutting. This is the most complex component of the cutting system and it requires a control system with actuation and some electronics. A significant benefit comes from the removal of the active tensioner. The current direction is the use of soft wires in place of the ones with steel core. The steel rope is replaced by a core wire made of superelastic alloy. The tension of the wire is an independent cutting parameter. The selection of the core wire architecture and diameter, the point along the stress-strain curve where the wire superelastic alloy is in nominal conditions and the use of stress-strain plafond in the curve are critical. The paper discusses first the principles of cutting with soft wire. Then the design of the cutting system is addressed and the requirements of robotized cutting machinery is discusses. Different simulation schemes and approaches are proposed to model cutting forces and system dynamics. In a multibody model with the wire treated as a discontinuous flexible winded along a system of pulleys. The data from the multibody analysis is used in the Finite elements to characterize the static and dynamic response of Pseudo-elastic wire segment between the two diamond beads...|$|R

50|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that 7.62 Tokarev surplus ammunition in the United States uses copper-coated mild steel bullets, and that this increases the chance of dangerous ricochets when fired at hard targets and can damage bullet traps often used on shooting ranges.
