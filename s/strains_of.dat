5|$|All {{commonly}} used research <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> E. coli belong to group A and are derived mainly from Clifton's K-12 strain (λ⁺ F⁺; O16) {{and to a}} lesser degree from d'Herelle's Bacillus coli strain (B strain)(O7).|$|E
5|$|In {{some species}} of RNA virus, the genes {{are not on}} a {{continuous}} molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> the virus in a process called reassortment.|$|E
5|$|Segmented genomes confer {{evolutionary}} advantages; different <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> a virus with a {{segmented genome}} can shuffle and combine genes and produce progeny viruses or (offspring) that have unique characteristics. This is called reassortment or viral sex.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{experimental}} results, {{this study also}} investigates {{the relationship between the}} <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> the stirrup and the peak maximum shear crack for each shear-span to depth ratio. The yielding <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> the stirrup that corresponds to the peak maximum shear crack width is then regressed linearly. When the stirrup yields, the peak maximum shear crack width ranges from 0.93 to 1.22  mm, suggesting that the shear-span to depth ratio only slightly affects the relationship between the yielding <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> the stirrup and the peak maximum shear crack width. Additionally, when the peak maximum shear crack width is limited to 0.3  mm, the allowable <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> stirrup ranges from 0.25 to 0.33 times the yielding <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> the stirrup; when the peak maximum shear crack width is limited to 1.0  mm, the allowable <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> stirrup ranges from 0.82 to 1.09 times the yielding <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> the stirrup.|$|R
50|$|A {{particular}} <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> {{bacteria can}} be nonpathogenic in one species but pathogenic in another.

5|$|An {{increasing}} number of infected individuals are found to harbor antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This results in initial treatment failure and requires additional rounds of antibiotic therapy or alternative strategies, such as a quadruple therapy, which adds a bismuth colloid, such as bismuth subsalicylate. For the treatment of clarithromycin-resistant <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> H. pylori, the use of levofloxacin {{as part of the}} therapy has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Anarchism {{does not}} offer a fixed body of {{doctrine}} from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not {{all of which are}} mutually exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. <b>Strains</b> <b>of</b> anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, Glynne's {{focus was}} on cereal diseases, {{especially}} soil-borne varieties. She was able {{to prove that the}} lodging or flattening of wheat close to harvest was frequently not the result of wind or rain, but instead caused by take-all and eyespot, both soil-borne fungal diseases. Glynne was able to not only identify the fungal cause and which <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> cereal were less susceptible, but also establish that crop rotation exacerbated the issue. On this basis, she was able to advise which <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> cereal should be planted in the affected fields. Glynne also discovered Gibellina cerealis in 1935, a fungal pathogen thought to be introduced to the UK by Roman settlers.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that Anopheles gambiae species A is resistant to DDT in Upper Volta and Togo, and DDT resistance has been found in a Sudan <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> species B. The species A strain from Upper Volta was more resistant to DDT than the Togo strain, while the Sudan <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> species B was the least resistant. The expression of resistance is genetically determined, and studies on the mode of inheritance have shown that resistance is inherited as a single dominant gene in the Togo <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> species A and the Sudan <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> species B, but that it is inherited as a single incompletely dominant gene in the Upper Volta <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> species A...|$|R

5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which pathogenic <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> the bacterium cause disease.

5|$|In fact, {{from the}} {{evolutionary}} point of view, {{the members of}} genus Shigella (S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei) should be classified as E. coli strains, a phenomenon termed taxa in disguise. Similarly, other <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> E. coli (e.g. the K-12 strain commonly used in recombinant DNA work) are sufficiently different that they would merit reclassification.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests show}} that fruit bodies have {{antimicrobial}} activity against several <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> drug-resistant bacteria that are pathogenic in humans. Extracts inhibit {{the growth of}} the Gram-negative bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes, and kill the Gram-positive species Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus agalactiae and S.pyogenes. A separate study demonstrated growth inhibition against Proteus vulgaris.|$|E
5|$|Lambic, a beer of Belgium, is {{naturally}} fermented using wild yeasts, rather than cultivated.

5|$|Linezolid has no {{clinically}} {{significant effect on}} most Gram-negative bacteria. Pseudomonas and the Enterobacteriaceae, for instance, are not susceptible. In vitro, it is active against Pasteurella multocida, Fusobacterium, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella, Bordetella, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, and moderately active (having a minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> 8mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae. It has also been used to great effect as a second-line treatment for Capnocytophaga infections.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia {{is due to}} infections caused {{primarily}} by bacteria or viruses and less commonly by fungi and parasites. Although {{there are more than}} 100 <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> infectious agents identified, only a few are responsible {{for the majority of the}} cases. Mixed infections with both viruses and bacteria may occur in up to 45% of infections in children and 15% of infections in adults.

5|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that nonpathogenic <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> H. pylori may be beneficial, e.g., by normalizing stomach acid secretion, and {{may play a role}} in regulating appetite, since its presence in the stomach results in a persistent but reversible reduction in the level of ghrelin.|$|E
5|$|Some {{people are}} {{resistant}} to certain <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> HIV. For example, people with the CCR5-Δ32 mutation {{are resistant to}} infection with R5 virus, as the mutation stops HIV from binding to this coreceptor, reducing its ability to infect target cells.|$|E
5|$|The type-IV {{secretion}} apparatus also injects the cag PAI-encoded protein CagA {{into the}} stomach's epithelial cells, where it disrupts the cytoskeleton, adherence to adjacent cells, intracellular signaling, cell polarity, and other cellular activities. Once inside the cell, the CagA protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues {{by a host}} cell membrane-associated tyrosine kinase (TK). CagA then allosterically activates protein tyrosine phosphatase/protooncogene Shp2. Pathogenic <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> H. pylori {{have been shown to}} activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a membrane protein with a TK domain. Activation of the EGFR by H. pylori is associated with altered signal transduction and gene expression in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis. A C-terminal region of the CagA protein (amino acids 873–1002) has also been suggested to be able to regulate host cell gene transcription, independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. A great deal of diversity exists between <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> H. pylori, and the strain that infects a person can predict the outcome.|$|E
