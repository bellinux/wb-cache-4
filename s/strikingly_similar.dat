40|$|TRF 1 and TRF 2 are key {{proteins}} in human telo-meres, which, despite their similarities, have differ-ent behaviors upon DNA binding. Previous work {{has shown that}} unlike TRF 1, TRF 2 condenses telomeric, thus creating consequential negative torsion on the adjacent DNA, a property that is thought {{to lead to the}} stimulation of single-strand invasion and was proposed to favor telomeric DNA looping. In this report, we show that these activities, originating from the central TRFH domain of TRF 2, are also dis-played by the TRFH domain of TRF 1 but are re-pressed in the full-length protein by the presence of an acidic domain at the N-terminus. <b>Strikingly,</b> a <b>similar</b> repression is observed on TRF 2 through th...|$|R

Moreover, the functional diads of potassium channel-blocking toxins from sea anemone and scorpions superimpose in the three-dimensional structures. Therefore, toxins that have unrelated structures but similar functions possess conserved key functional residues, organized in an identical topology, suggesting a convergent functional evolution for these small proteins...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} role of {{invariant}} Natural Killer T cell (iNKT) cells in autoimmune thyroiditis, we derived two iNKT cell lines from the spleens of NOD· H 2 h 4 mice, a strain that develops spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis exacerbated by excess dietary iodine. The two lines were CD 1 d-restricted and expressed CD 4 +, DX 5 +, and the Vα 4 Jα 281 gene segment, of the T-cell receptor α locus. Upon stimulation with α-galactosyl-ceramide (α-GalCer), both lines rapidly produced IL- 2, IL- 4, IFN-γ, IL- 10, and TNF-α. <b>Strikingly,</b> a <b>similar</b> cytokine response was also induced by thyroglobulin, {{one of the most}} abundant protein in the thyroid gland and a major autoantigen in human autoimmune thyroiditis. Transfer of the iNKT cell lines to syngeneic hosts enhanced autoimmune thyroiditis. Intraperitoneal injections of α-GalCer in iodine primed mice also induced thyroid disease.

40|$|Upon infection, {{pathogens}} reprogram host gene expression. In eukaryotic cells, genetic reprogramming is {{induced by}} the concerted activation/repression of transcription factors and various histone modifications that control DNA accessibility in chromatin. We report here that the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes induces a dramatic dephosphorylation of histone H 3 {{as well as a}} deacetylation of histone H 4 during early phases of infection. This effect is mediated by the major listerial toxin listeriolysin O in a pore-forming-independent manner. <b>Strikingly,</b> a <b>similar</b> effect also is observed with other toxins of the same family, such as Clostridium perfringens perfringolysin and Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin. The decreased levels of histone modifications correlate with a reduced transcriptional activity of a subset of host genes, including key immunity genes. Thus, control of epigenetic regulation emerges here as an unsuspected function shared by several bacterial toxins, highlighting a common strategy used by intracellular and extracellular pathogens to modulate the host response early during infection...|$|R
40|$|This Essay {{seeks to}} provide a {{theoretical}} framework for conceptualizing this relationship and considering reforms. Part I traces the variation of campaign finance regimes across several political eras and several jurisdictional scales. <b>Strikingly,</b> although <b>similar</b> six-figure campaign finance scandals prompted the reforms of each era, federal lawmakers in each era have drawn progressively lower one-size-fits-all contribution limits and disclosure thresholds. Meanwhile, state campaign finance laws have been more carefully calibrated to reflect the electoral and financial circumstances of particular electoral contests. Part II considers the currently permissible means and ends of campaign finance law and how they constrain the calibration of contribution limits and disclosure thresholds. Part III explains how a recalibration of campaign finance laws in some jurisdictions might bring these regulations into alignment with the constitutional justifications for-and policy goals of-our system of campaign finance laws. Recalibration offers an important opportunity for both opponents and proponents of regulation to ensure a better fit between the means and ends of campaign finance law...|$|R

Thermobarometric estimates with thermocalc and Raman Spectroscopy of carbonaceous material reveal homogeneous peak burial conditions at around 540 ± 20 °C and 23 ± 1 kbar. P-T paths indicate that the whole of the ophiolite, at least 60 km across, <b>strikingly</b> underwent <b>similar</b> burial and exhumation patterns and detached from the slab at depths around 80 km. The Zermatt-Saas ophiolite thus appears to be the world's largest oceanic lithosphere fragment exhumed from such depths, which provides important constraints on interplate coupling mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Biologically active {{membrane}} gangliosides, expressed {{and released}} by many human tumors, are hypothesized to significantly impact tumor progression. Lack {{of a model}} of complete and specific tumor ganglioside depletion in vivo, however, has hampered elucidation of their role. Here we report {{the creation of a}} novel, stable, genetically induced tumor cell system resulting in specific and complete blockade of ganglioside synthesis. Wild type (WT) and GM 3 synthase/GM 2 synthase double knockout (DKO) murine embryonic fibroblasts were transformed using amphotropic retrovirus-transduced oncogenes (pBABE-c-MycT 58 A+H-RasG 12 V). The transformed cells, WTt and DKOt respectively, evidenced comparable integrated copy numbers and oncogene expression. Ganglioside synthesis was completely blocked in the DKOt cells, importantly without triggering an alternate pathway of ganglioside synthesis. Ganglioside depletion (to < 0. 5 nmol/ 107 cells from 9 - 11 nmol/ 107 WTt or untransfected normal fibroblasts) did not adversely affect cell proliferation kinetics but did reduce cell migration on fibronectin-coated wells, consistent with our previous observations in ganglioside-depleted normal human fibroblasts. <b>Strikingly,</b> despite <b>similar</b> oncogene expression and growth kinetics, DKOt cells evidenced significantly impaire...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: India {{has more}} than 20, 000 {{registered}} pharmaceutical manufacturers. Consequently, there is a flood of brand names to choose from. We conducted this study to analyse and sort out the multitudinous brand names thronging the Indian market, and identified those that could create a possible confusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recent issues of drug formularies like Indian Drug Review, Drug Index, and Monthly Index of Medical Specialities-India were checked and all the brand names given were included. Some other brand names that are available with the pharmacists but {{are not included in}} these indexes were also included in the study for analysis. OBSERVATIONS: Potentially confusing brand names were sorted out and categorised according to the severity of damage they can cause if misinterpreted by the pharmacist or the patient. Subgroups were made according to the brand name, the generic name, and the manufacturers of the drug. CONCLUSION: Several brand names are <b>strikingly</b> identical, <b>similar</b> looking (orthographic), or similar sounding (phonological). Preventing this possible confusion is not the work of any one person involved. We describe the role of prescribing doctors, dispensing pharmacists, consumer patients, and the manufacturing companies to prevent "wrong prescribing" due to similarities in brand names...|$|R

40|$|Telomere {{biology is}} {{frequently}} associated with disease evolution in human cancer and dysfunctional telomeres {{have been demonstrated}} to contribute to genetic instability. In BCR-ABL(+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), accelerated telomere shortening {{has been shown to}} correlate with leukemia progression, risk score and response to treatment. Here, we demonstrate that proliferation of murine CML-like bone marrow cells strongly depends on telomere maintenance. CML-like cells of telomerase knockout mice with critically short telomeres (CML-iG 4) are growth retarded and proliferation is terminally stalled by a robust senescent cell cycle arrest. In sharp contrast, CML-like cells with pre-shortened, but not critically short telomere lengths (CML-G 2) grew most rapidly and were found to express a specific 'telomere-associated secretory phenotype', comprising secretion of chemokines, interleukins and other growth factors, thereby potentiating oncogene-driven growth. Moreover, conditioned supernatant of CML-G 2 cells markedly enhanced proliferation of CML-WT and pre-senescent CML-iG 4 cells. <b>Strikingly,</b> a <b>similar</b> inflammatory mRNA expression pattern was found with disease progression from chronic phase to accelerated phase in CML patients.

40|$|In Mark Danielewski’s {{experimental}} novel House of Leaves (2000), {{space is}} a crucial concern. Yet, as this paper will argue, space seems {{less to do with}} geographical, political, or socio-cultural factors, and more to do with what French writer and critic Maurice Blanchot calls the ‘space of literature’—the ineffable place of origin of any work of art. In House of Leaves, a mysterious and ever-shifting labyrinth is unexpectedly found inside and below a house, which causes extreme feelings of disorientation and discomfort to anyone who enters it. This strange place of the story seems particularly identifiable with Blanchot’s space—a space of impossible geography, of blackness, and nothingness. However, since the voice of art speaks solely from here, the artist must necessarily engage with its perturbing discovery to be able to create. Not only does the novel evoke Blanchot’s view, it <b>strikingly</b> echoes other <b>similar</b> musings on the workings of literature—such as those put forward by Samuel Beckett, whose presence in the text is also tangible...|$|R

5|$|Ants of this genus are {{considered}} to be the most primitive within the family Formicidae. The body presents a wasp-like structure but with several ant-like characteristics. These ant-like characteristics, however, are primitive compared to more modern ants, and thus it is intermediate with other primitive ants and aculeate wasps. The presence of the metapleural gland, the nodiform (a structure resembling a node, which is a segment found between the mesosoma and gaster, the bulbous posterior portion of the metasoma), the structure of the petiole and its general physical appearance of an ant concludes Sphecomyrma species are ants rather than wasps; the absence of the metapleural gland would mean that it is most likely a wasp instead of an ant. It is not exactly known which group of wasps are the descendants of Sphecomyrma, but members of the family Tiphiidae, particularly those in the genus Methocha are <b>strikingly</b> <b>similar</b> with Sphecomyrma.

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} describes {{naturally occurring}} genetic differences among individuals {{of the same}} species and permits flexibility and survival of a population in the face of changing environmental circumstances, diseases and pests. Genomic variation develops from a combination of evolutionary influences, among them, mutation process and demographic history. Understanding in greater detail the basis of the tremendous phenotypic variability in East African Highland bananas subgroup that are apparently clonal variants of a single original seedling is essential for developing improved breeding strategies for this subgroup. While genetic diversity studies have included cultivars from this subgroup, intra- population structure and phylogenetic relationships per se are still unknown. In addition, none of these studies have attempted to study the evolutionary history and epigenetic polymorphism in this subgroup. In this thesis, I have used EAHB cultivars to assess the genetic variation, population structure and evolutionary history. I focus on the role of DNA methylation as an epigenetic mark that contributes to phenotypic diversity and determine inheritance of DNA methylation patterns in sexual and vegetative propagation models. The results show that despite being phenotypically distinct, these cultivars are <b>strikingly</b> genetically <b>similar</b> with a narrow genetic base. While DNA methylation polymorphisms are common amongst EAHB cultivars, MSAP does not detect any obvious relationship between DNA methylation variation and phenotypic variation in East African Highland bananas. This study demonstrates that the EAHB subgroup has low mutation rates, show past population expansion but may have suffered a genetic bottleneck that may have led to the low genetic diversity. Extensive linkage disequilibrium and balancing selection were observed.

40|$|Birds have {{frequently}} evolved to exploit insular environments by becoming adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle and losing {{the ability to}} fly, usually via reducing the wings and pectoral girdle. The enigmatic flightless ibis Xenicibis xympithecus (Threskiornithidae) from the Quaternary of Jamaica provides a rare example of flight loss in ibises. We report on previously undescribed fossils of Xenicibis, and show that the wing differed radically from that of all other birds, flightless or volant. The metacarpus is elongate, grotesquely inflated and has extremely thick walls; phalanges are short and block-like; the radius is distally expanded; and the humerus is elongate. The furcula, coracoid and sternum are all well developed. We propose that the elongate forelimb and massive hand functioned in combat as a jointed club or flail. This hypothesis {{is supported by the}} morphology of the carpometacarpus, by features permitting rapid extension of the wing and by the presence of fractures in wing bones. Although other birds use the wings as weapons, none resemble Xenicibis, which represents a unique and extraordinary morphological solution to this functional problem.

This syndrome is characterized by hypergammaglobulinaemia, high levels of anti-DNA antibodies, {{as well as by}} circulating immune complexes and glomerular deposits of Ig. The role of host T cells in this model was investigated by using athymic BALB/c nu/nu mice as recipients of normal (C 57 BL/ 6 x BALB. Igb) F 1 spleen cells. In these "tolerized" BALB/c nu/nu mice, there was a persistence of F 1 donor B cells but none of the autoimmune features were expressed, conversely to tolerized BALB/c nu/+ littermates. The injection of CD 4 +CD 8 - T lymphocytes from adult normal BALB/c mice in 3 -wk-old tolerized BALB/c nu/nu mice triggered the appearance of all the autoimmune findings observed in euthymic tolerant mice. The autoantibodies were produced by persisting F 1 donor B cells as shown by allotype analysis. More <b>strikingly,</b> a <b>similar</b> triggering of the autoimmune syndrome, including high titers of anti-DNA IgG antibodies and circulating immune complexes, was observed after injection of CD 4 +CD 8 - T cells from 2 -wk-old tolerant BALB/c mice into "tolerized" BALB/c nu/nu mice. The anti-ssDNA antibodies were shown to bear only the Ighb allotype, indicating their exclusive origin from F 1 donor B cells. These results imply that CD 4 + T cells from the tolerant mice are necessary for the activation of autoreactive F 1 B cells and {{for the development of the}} autoimmune syndrome occurring in this model.

40|$|AbstractUsing nanoindentation we have {{investigated}} the local strain rate sensitivity in dual-phase Ti alloys, Ti– 6 Al– 2 Sn– 4 Zr-xMo (x =  2 and 6), as strain rate sensitivity could be a potential factor causing cold dwell fatigue. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was used to select hard and soft grain orientations {{within each of the}} alloys. Nanoindentation based tests using the continuous stiffness measurement (CSM) method were performed with variable strain rates, on the order of 10 − 1 to 10 − 3 s− 1. Local strain rate sensitivity is determined using a power law linking equivalent flow stress and equivalent plastic strain rate. Analysis of residual impressions using both a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a focused ion beam (FIB) reveals local deformation around the indents and shows that nanoindentation tested structures containing both α and β phases within individual colonies. This indicates that the indentation results are derived from averaged α/β properties. The results show that a trend of local rate sensitivity in Ti 6242 and Ti 6246 is <b>strikingly</b> different; as <b>similar</b> rate sensitivities are found in Ti 6246 regardless of grain orientation, whilst a grain orientation dependence is observed in Ti 6242.
