An automatic <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> is often required to convey parts to complete a series of processes in a modern production line. But the traditional automatic <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> has problems of large volume, high noise and low efficiency. It has reduced the efficiency of production line. So it is necessary to make innovation for the automatic feeding system. A new type of automatic <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> based on linear servo motor is proposed in the paper. This device overcomes some disadvantages of the traditional automatic <b>feeding</b> <b>device.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|In general, demand <b>feeding</b> <b>devices</b> are {{equipped}} with a mechanical trigger switch. Such a switch is not suitable for juvenile fish with a small body size, because the body weight is insufficient to trigger the feeder. An infrared light sensor that {{does not require the}} fish to push a feeder switch is more suitable for small fish. The brown-marbled grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus is an important fish species in Southeast Asia. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the growth rates (GRs) of brown-marbled grouper juveniles reared using customised demand <b>feeding</b> <b>devices</b> with an infrared light sensor (the infrared light demand feeder (IRDF) group) and automatic <b>feeding</b> <b>devices</b> (the automatic feeder (AF) group). The results indicated that GRs of standard lengths and body weights showed no significant differences using one-way analysis of variance; however, the standard length of the IRDF group showed a tendency of a higher GR than the AF group. Although the feed conversion ratio (FCR) also showed no significant difference, the FCR of the IRDF group was more efficient, indicating that the IRDF group yielded a more desirable FCR. These results indicate that IRDF can be used in the culture of brown-marbled grouper juveniles. In view of the working schedule of the fish farm staff, IRDF are superior to other <b>feeding</b> <b>devices,</b> because they are less labour-intensive than usual tasks. We conclude that IRDF is a useful feeding system for aquaculture...|$|R

40|$|Foraging {{behaviours}} used by {{two female}} Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) were documented during controlled feeding trials. During these trials the seals {{were presented with}} prey either free-floating in open water or concealed within a mobile ball or a static box <b>feeding</b> <b>device.</b> When targeting free-floating prey both subjects primarily used raptorial biting in combination with suction, which was used to draw prey to within range of the teeth. When targeting prey concealed within either the mobile or static <b>feeding</b> <b>device,</b> the seals {{were able to use}} suction to draw out prey items that could not be reached by biting. Suction was followed by lateral water expulsion, where water drawn into the mouth along with the prey item was purged via the sides of the mouth. Vibrissae were used to explore the surface of the <b>feeding</b> <b>devices,</b> especially when locating the openings in which the prey items had been hidden. The mobile ball device was also manipulated by pushing it with the muzzle to knock out concealed prey, which was not possible when using the static <b>feeding</b> <b>device.</b> To knock prey out of this static device one seal used targeted bubble blowing, where a focused stream of bubbles was blown out of the nose into the openings in the device. Once captured in the jaws, prey items were manipulated and re-oriented using further mouth movements or chews so that they could be swallowed head first. While most items were swallowed whole underwater, some were instead taken to the surface and held in the teeth, while being vigorously shaken to break them into smaller pieces before swallowing.

Operated under ambient extraction and HCl stripping conditions, 0. 95 F OPAP was found to be a highly suitable extractant for the removal of iron(III) from strong synthetic ZnSO 4 -H 2 SO 4 solutions and for the preparation of concentrated iron chloride strip solutions. Its major advantages included: very low sulphate co-extraction; reasonable zinc co-extraction; very low chloride back-extraction; and sufficient iron build-up and acid balance when a 'moderate strength' HCl-FeCl 2 <b>strip</b> <b>feed</b> (3. 38 N HCl- 58. 5 g/L Fe(II) - 9. 7 g/L Fe(III)) was used.

These included a greater relative stability in aqueous streams, slightly better Fe 3 +/Zn 2 + selectivity, and a comparable iron(III) loading capacity (∼ 20 g/L) when operated at 50 °C. However, major drawbacks with D 2 EHPA were identified which included significant sulphate co-extraction (approximately twenty times greater than 0. 95 F OPAP) and ineffective stripping and hence poor iron build-up (< 100 g/L) with the 'moderate strength' <b>strip</b> <b>feed...</b>|$|R

40|$|Much {{interest}} has developed {{in recent years}} in a procedure to rear neonatal pigs by use of automatic <b>feeding</b> equipment. Several <b>devices</b> of similar design have been used for both sterile, disease free environments utilizing hysterectomy or cesarean-derived pigs and for pigs born normally and taken from the sow at 8 - 36 hours post-partum. The purpose of the research reported herein was to determine if an automated <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> could be used to rear naturally-farrowed and hysterectomy-derived pigs with good performance and survival rate. Three experiments were conducted using 34 crossbred neonatal piglets to determine the feasibility of rearing newborn pigs with an automatic <b>feeding</b> <b>device.</b> In addition, three trials were conducted with 49 crossbred hysterectomy-derived pigs to study the requirements of disease-free pigs in terms of diets and management considerations.
