His total sales by then had been $83,000 with additional supplies of stock and his profit of about $20,000 was divided equally between his backers Williams, Bradford and Co. and himself. On {{the advice of his}} supplier who noted the downturn in the California Gold Rush, Corbett left for New York in July 1852, leaving his store with employees Finley McLaren and Robert McLaren.

Hastings was buoyant, rapidly progressive, and looking forward to the time ere long, it might become an incorporated village, when these severe disasters, followed by the general depression occasioned by scant harvests, and the embarrassment of the agricultural community, placed a barrier against further progress, and caused a withdrawal of a portion of the inhabitants to seek more remunerative employment elsewhere. But this dark day, it is believed, has to a threat extent passed away; and increased hope and renewed enterprise promise ere long to restore this fine village to more than its former prosperity.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{individual}} or institutional investors rely on the information&# 13; provided by the financial analysts. A good stock recommended by financial experts is expected to make&# 13; profit to the investors. However, due to the cognitive biases, the financial analysts or investors are&# 13; probably confused in the firm characteristics between the good stocks and the <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> companies. &# 13; Good companies are normally inferred to the company that have good managing and operating systems,&# 13; however, it is usually though to have good returns as good stocks. The future earning forecasts <b>of</b> these&# 13; <b>good</b> companies may be thus overestimated as compared with the others. Such cognitive biases&# 13; probably results in improper investment and investment loss. In this study, the reputation survey results&# 13; for the companies in Taiwan and the corresponding financial data are used to verify the proposed&# 13; cognitive biases hypothesis. The empirical evidence in this study shows that financial analysts mistake&# 13; <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> companies for good stocks.
