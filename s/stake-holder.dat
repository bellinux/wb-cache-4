50|$|The {{challenger}} and Champion, {{or their}} agents, discussed the ‘terms’ {{and came to}} an agreement. Sometimes challenges failed at this stage as there was no agreement or the challenger was unable to raise the money. Once the challenge was accepted the ‘articles’ would be drawn up and signed by the contestants and witnessed. The articles would state where and when the match was to be held, who the umpire was to be, how much the stake per side was to be {{and when it was}} to be paid in, and who the literal <b>stake-holder</b> was to be, and a few other details.

5000|$|Founder {{and former}} Eclipse CEO Vern Raburn {{was one of}} the first {{business}} executives at Microsoft. Subsequently, Bill Gates became a major <b>stake-holder</b> in the Eclipse project. The VLJ concept has been pursued by a number of manufacturers, and because the V-Jet II had been designed around one of the primary VLJ engines, Eclipse believed it was an ideal design to refine and market. [...] The airframe was significantly redesigned as an all-metal structure with a T-tail and straight wings. The main cabin shape is essentially all that was retained from the V-Jet II. It was recognized that for an aluminum structure to be cost effective, new manufacturing techniques would have to be developed. One of the primary processes used was friction stir welding, in which the skin and underlying aluminum structure are welded together rather than riveted, as traditional for aluminum aircraft. Anti-corrosion bonding techniques were also developed.|$|E
