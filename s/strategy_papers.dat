Progress {{in the preparation}} of the PRSP has been slow. Consequently, the original completion date of end-December 2002 envisaged in the interim poverty reduction <b>strategy</b> <b>paper</b> (I-PRSP) was not attained, and the new target completion date is end-December 2003. The delay has been owing to the slow pace in implementing the disarmament exercise, the conduct of general elections, and administrative and financing difficulties.

50|$|A {{researcher}} at a leading global think-tank, the Overseas Development Institute, suggests that far more effort {{should be done}} to better coordinate and integrate poverty reduction strategies with climate change adaptation. The two issues are argued to be currently only dealt with in parallel as most poverty reduction <b>strategy</b> <b>papers</b> ignore climate change adaptation altogether, while National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) likewise do not deal directly with poverty reduction. Adaptation-poverty linkages were found to be strongest in NAPAs from sub-Saharan Africa LDCs.|$|E

The process represents an embrace of the values of participation and transparency in the formulation of macroeconomic policy, and thus has the potential to shape the content of these policies {{in order to meet the}} needs of the poor.|$|E
