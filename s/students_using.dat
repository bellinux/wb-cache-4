40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} that the writer wants to describe the standard and the dominant standard of bibliography used by the English Department students in their thesis from 2001 to 2003 periods. The design of this study is descriptive qualitative research. The population is the English Department student’s thesis that consist 116 theses in 2001 - 2003 periods and the writer takes 17 theses as the sample. This study uses document to collect data. The document in this study is the English Department student’s thesis in 2001 to 2003 periods. Based on the data analysis, there are nine standards of bibliography used by the English Department students in their thesis from 2001 to 2003 periods. The data shows that there are 3 <b>students</b> <b>used</b> American Psychological Association (APA), 2 <b>students</b> <b>used</b> Chicago, 1 <b>student</b> <b>used</b> Turabian, 1 <b>student</b> <b>used</b> Modern Language Association (MLA), 6 <b>students</b> <b>used</b> The Team of Indonesian Department Muhammadiyah University of Malang, 1 <b>student</b> <b>used</b> Sutrisno Hadi, 1 <b>student</b> <b>used</b> Wahab and Lestari, 1 <b>student</b> <b>used</b> Soemanto, 1 <b>student</b> <b>used</b> Nasution. From the result above, the writer concludes that the English Department <b>students</b> <b>used</b> a great variety of standard of bibliography and the dominant standard used by the English Department students in their thesis is the standard created by The Team of Indonesian Department Muhammadiyah University of Malang. There are also several reasons why they used various standard of bibliography. It is hoped that the result of this study will be useful for English Department as well as the students. For English Department, it is hoped to set up standard of bibliography because it is proven that the English Department <b>students</b> <b>used</b> various standard of bibliography. It is expected that English Department and all the thesis advisors at English Department Muhammadiyah University of Malang sit together and decide what standard of bibliography should be followed. So the students who write bibliography in their thesis or other scientific writing would have uniformity...|$|R

Instructors will also be able to recognize diversity among students by using various teaching and assessment techniques during their class. OBE is meant to be a student-centered learning model. Teachers are meant to guide and help the students understand the material in any way necessary, study guides, and group work are some of the methods instructors can use to facilitate students learning.|$|E
25|$|To {{support and}} verify such {{assumptions}} about dialogue journal writing, studies {{will need to}} provide for random assignment of students to either dialogue journal writing or a control condition for a sufficient length of time, ideally within the same instructional context. Where this is not possible, carefully designed studies of individual students can yield strong research evidence. For example, Regan, Mastropiere, and Scruggs conducted a study of special-needs <b>students</b> <b>using</b> a multiple baseline design to measure outcomes of a dialogue journal intervention compared to baseline data. Studies following this design can provide a model of dialogue journal research that addresses issues of selection and maturation.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose for}} {{conducting}} {{this study was}} to determine how administrator concerns about the Internet, teacher use of the Internet, and on-site technical assistance relate to <b>student</b> <b>use</b> of the Internet in Nebraska schools and to determine which of these variables are significant predictors of <b>student</b> <b>use</b> of Internet in school. The study also provided descriptive information about each of these variables. ^ The population for this study was limited to Class II, Class III, Class IV, Class V, and Class VI public high schools in the State of Nebraska which had access to the Internet. The high school principals and the technology coordinators at all one hundred eighty (180) high schools that matched the requirement for participation were surveyed. Administrator concerns about Internet were measured with the 35 question Stages of Concern (SoC) survey. Teacher use of Internet and on-site technical assistance were measured with a 18 question section of the technology coordinator survey. <b>Student</b> <b>use</b> of Internet in school was measured with a 14 question section in both the administrator and technology coordinator surveys. ^ Significant positive correlations were found between teacher use of Internet and <b>student</b> <b>use</b> of Internet in school (. 672) and between availability of on-site technical assistance and <b>student</b> <b>use</b> of Internet in school (. 245). The level of significance was set at p 3 ̆c. 05. ^ A matched samples design t-test failed to find a significant difference between the mean scores for administrators 2 ̆ 7 and technology coordinators 2 ̆ 7 perceptions about <b>student</b> <b>use</b> of the Internet in school. ^ Multiple regression analysis was used to determine which of the variables were significant at the. 05 level for predicting <b>student</b> <b>use</b> of Internet in school. Teacher use of Internet was found to be the only significant predictor of <b>student</b> <b>use</b> of the Internet in school. ...|$|R

25|$|Public {{institutions}} in the U.S. have also drawn fire for accommodating Islam {{at the expense of}} taxpayers. The University of Michigan–Dearborn and a public college in Minnesota have been criticized for accommodating Islamic prayer rituals by constructing footbaths for Muslim <b>students</b> <b>using</b> tax-payers' money. Critics said this special accommodation, which is made to satisfy the needs of Muslims alone, is a violation of Constitutional provisions separating church and state. Along the same constitutional lines, a San Diego public elementary school is being criticized for making special accommodations, specifically for American Muslims, by adding Arabic to its curriculum and giving breaks for Muslim prayers. Some critics said exceptions have not been made for any religious group in the past, and they see this as an endorsement of Islam.|$|E

In 1827 Bishop Dubourg placed Saint Louis College {{in the care of}} the Society of Jesus, not long after which it received its charter as a university by act of the Missouri Legislature. In 1829 it moved to Washington Avenue and Ninth at the site of today's America's Center by the Edward Jones Dome. In 1852 the university and its teaching priests were the subject of a viciously anti-Catholic novel, The Mysteries of St. Louis, written by newspaper editor Henry Boernstein whose popular paper, the Anzeiger des Westens was also a foe of the university.|$|E

25|$|A rise {{in social}} network use is {{being driven by}} college <b>students</b> <b>using</b> the {{services}} to network with professionals for internship and job opportunities. Many {{studies have been done}} on the effectiveness of networking online in a college setting, and one notable one is by Phipps Arabie and Yoram Wind published in Advances in Social Network Analysis. Many schools have implemented online alumni directories which serve as makeshift social networks that current and former students can turn to for career advice. However, these alumni directories tend to suffer from an oversupply of advice-seekers and an undersupply of advice providers. One new social networking service, Ask-a-peer, aims to solve this problem by enabling advice seekers to offer modest compensation to advisers for their time. LinkedIn is also another great resource. It helps alumni, students and unemployed individuals look for work. They are also able to connect with others professionally and network with companies.|$|E
25|$|Schwyz {{is home to}} the Kantonsschule Kollegium Schwyz (KKS), {{an upper}} Secondary school that is a Gymnasium and a {{vocational}} or technical college. The KKS has operated for over 150 years, though it builds on several older schools. The first Latin school in Schwyz opened in 1627 in the former Capuchin monastery of St. Josef im Loo. This school remained open until the 1798 French invasion. On 25 July 1841, the Jesuits laid the cornerstone of what would become the Jesuit College {{on the site of the}} modern Kollegium. The school opened in 1844 but only remained under Jesuit control for three years. In 1847, Federal troops marched into Schwyz to suppress the Catholic Sonderbund and forced the Jesuits to flee. It was reopened in 1855 under the Capuchin Father Theodosius Florentini and in the following year began teaching students. The school continued to teach <b>students</b> <b>using</b> both religious and secular teachers until the 1970s. In 1972, the lower Secondary students moved to Pfäffikon and the school became an upper Secondary Kantonsschule.|$|E
