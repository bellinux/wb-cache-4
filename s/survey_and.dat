In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, although it may be acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would <b>survey</b> <b>and</b> study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital.

5|$|Archaeologists {{have studied}} the {{prehistory}} of Iowa since the mid-19th century, when large American Indian mounds were first observed along the Mississippi. Early archaeologists such as S.V. Proudfit and Theodore Lewis documented large sites such as earthworks, mounds, and earthlodges. Truly systematic recording of Iowa sites began with Charles R. Keyes and Ellison Orr’s surveys and excavations beginning in the 1920s. Documenting hundreds of sites, often just before they disappeared under the plow, Keyes’ and Orr’s work {{led to the formation}} of the Iowa Archaeological Survey, the Iowa Archeological Society, and the designation of Effigy Mounds National Monument. After their deaths in 1951, the Survey was disbanded, and their efforts were continued by the University of Iowa’s Department of Sociology and Anthropology, which formed the Office of the State Archaeologist (OSA) in 1959. The OSA maintains an extensive list of more than 23,000 recorded archaeological sites in Iowa, and conducts <b>survey</b> <b>and</b> excavation across the state. Other institutions conducting archaeological research in Iowa include the State Historical Society of Iowa, the Iowa Archeological Society, the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, Grinnell College, Luther College, and private archaeological firms. Professional archaeologists in Iowa are represented by the Association of Iowa Archaeologists. Iowa archaeology grew dramatically beginning in the 1960s with the introduction of Cultural Resources Management legislation that required archaeological <b>survey</b> <b>and</b> excavation at many federal projects in Iowa.|$|E

40|$|Many {{universities}} {{around the}} world are experiencing a {{decline in the number of}} students entering programs in <b>surveying</b> <b>and</b> geospatial engineering, including some institutions with prestigious pasts. For Australia, this raises the question of whether there will be adequate graduates in the future to replace the current cohort of <b>surveying</b> <b>and</b> geospatial professionals when they retire. It is not clear why it has not been possible to attract more school leavers into the <b>surveying</b> <b>and</b> geospatial programs, but it may be because the community at large is unaware of the many career opportunities. Several surveys have been carried out in Australia to determine the status of graduates entering the profession and the impact that shortages of graduates in the <b>surveying</b> <b>and</b> geospatial professions in the future. These shortages could seriously limit the development of infrastructure and housing if they are not overcome. Another issue is whether the demand for graduates is changing due to developments in technology that allow <b>surveying</b> <b>and</b> mapping to be undertaken more quickly and efficiently than in the past. Marketing of education programs into schools and the general population is essential. A solution maybe for a concerted global effort to encourage more school leavers to enrol in <b>surveying</b> <b>and</b> geospatial engineering programs and hence improve the viability of the profession for the future. The paper will review the impacts of shortages in graduates entering the profession and approaches to improve the marketing of the <b>surveying</b> <b>and</b> geospatial professions...|$|R
