One year later, a hammerhead ribozyme was also reported in the <b>satellite</b> <b>DNA</b> of newt genomes.

40|$|Monopartite begomoviruses (Geminiviridae), {{which are}} whitefly-transmitted {{single-stranded}} DNA viruses known for causing devastating crop diseases, are {{often associated with}} <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Since begomovirus acquisition or exchange of <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> may lead to adaptation to new plant hosts and emergence of new disease complexes, {{it is important to}} investigate the diversity and distribution of these molecules. This study reports begomovirus-associated <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> identified during a vector-enabled metagenomic (VEM) survey of begomoviruses using whiteflies collected in various locations (California (USA), Guatemala, Israel, Puerto Rico, and Spain). Protein-encoding <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs,</b> including alphasatellites and betasatellites, were identified in Israel, Puerto Rico, and Guatemala. Novel alphasatellites were detected in samples from Guatemala and Puerto Rico, resulting in the description of a phylogenetic clade (DNA- 3 -type alphasatellites) dominated by New World sequences. In addition, a diversity of small (~ 640 – 750 nucleotides) <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> similar to <b>satellites</b> associated with begomoviruses infecting Ipomoea spp. were detected in Puerto Rico and Spain. A third class of satellite molecules, named gammasatellites, is proposed to encompass the increasing number of reported small (< 1 kilobase), non-coding begomovirus-associated <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs.</b> This VEM-based survey indicates that, although recently recovered begomovirus genomes are variations of known genetic themes, <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> hold unexplored genetic diversity...|$|R
40|$|Tandemly {{repeated}} DNAs, {{referred to}} as <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs,</b> often occur in a genome in a genus-specific manner. However, the mechanisms for generation and evolution for these sequences are largely unknown because of the uncertain origins of the <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs.</b> We found highly divergent genus-specific <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> that showed sequence similarity with genus-specific intergenic spacers (IGSs) in the family Solanaceae, which includes the genera Nicotiana, Solanum and Capsicum. The conserved position of the IGS between 25 S and 18 S rDNA facilitates comparison of IGS sequences across genera, even {{in the presence of}} very low sequence similarity. Sequence comparison of IGS may elucidate the procedure of the genesis of complex monomer units of the <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Within the IGS of Capsicum species, base substitutions and copy number variation of subrepeat monomers were causes of monomer divergence in IGS sequences. At the level of inter-generic IGS sequences of the family Solanaceae, however, genus-specific motif selection, motif shuffling between subrepeats and differential amplification among motifs were involved in formation of genus-specific IGS. Therefore, the genus-specific <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> in Solanaceae plants can be generated from differentially organized repeat monomers of the IGS rather than by accumulation of mutations from pre-existent <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs...</b>|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the long-range organization and the intrinsic curvature of <b>satellite</b> 1 <b>DNA,</b> an unusual tandemly-repeated DNA family of Xenopus laevis presenting sequence homologies to SINEs.

Besides that, we have analysed the secondary structure of <b>satellite</b> 1 <b>DNA</b> by computer modelling. Theoretical maps of curvature obtained from three independent models of DNA bending (the dinucleotide wedge model of Trifonov, the junction model of Crothers and the model of de Santis) showed that <b>satellite</b> 1 <b>DNA</b> is intrinsically curved and these results were confirmed experimentally by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

50|$|Micronuclei {{formation}} {{may also}} result from chromosome malsegregation during anaphase. Hypomethylation of cytosine in centromeric and pericentromeric areas and higher-order repeats of <b>satellite</b> <b>DNA</b> in centromeric DNA {{can result in}} such chromosomal loss events. Classical <b>satellite</b> <b>DNA</b> is normally heavily methylated at cytosine residues but may become almost fully unmethylated due to ICF syndrome (Immunodeficiency, centromere instability, and facial anomalies syndrome) or after treatment by DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. Since assembly of kinetochore proteins at centromeres {{is affected by the}} methylation of cytosine and histone proteins, a reduction in heterochromatin integrity as a result of hypomethylation can interfere with microtubule attachment to chromosomes and with the sensing of tension from correct microtubule-kinetochore connections. Other possible causes of chromosome loss that could lead to micronuclei formation are defects in kinetochore and microtubule interactions, defects in mitotic spindle assembly, mitosis check point defects, abnormal centrosome amplification, and telomeric end fusions that result in dicentric chromosomes that detach from the spindle during anaphase. Micronuclei originating from chromosome loss events and acentric chromosome fragments can be distinguished using pancentromeric DNA probes.|$|E

40|$|We have {{characterized}} <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> from 9 {{species of}} kangaroo rat (Dipodomys) and {{have shown that}} the HS-α and HS-β satellites, where present, are nearly identical in all species as to melting transition midpoint (Tm), and density in neutral CsCl, alkaline CsCl, and Cs 2 SO 4 -Ag+ gradients. However, the MS satellites exist in two internally similar classes. The <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> from three other rodents were characterized (densities listed are in neutral CsCl). The pocket gopher, Thomomysbottae, contains Th-α (1. 713 g/ml) and Th-β (1. 703 g/ml). The guinea pig (Caviaporcellus) contains Ca-α, Ca-β and Ca-γ at densities of 1. 706 g/ml, 1. 704 g/ml and 1. 704 g/ml, respectively. The antelope ground squirrel (Ammospermophilusharrisi) contains Am-α, 1. 708 g/ml, Am-β, 1. 717 g/ml, and Am-γ, 1. 707 g/ml. The physical and chemical properties of the alpha-satellites from the above four rodents representing four different families in two suborders of Rodentia were compared. They show nearly identical Tm, nucleoside composition of single strands, and single strand densities in alkaline CsCl. Similar comparisons on the second or third <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> from these rodents also indicate a close relationship to each other. Thus the high degree of similarity of satellite sequences found in such a diverse group of rodents suggests a cellular function that is subject to natural selection, and implies that these sequences have been conserved over a considerable span of evolutionary time since the divergence of these rodents about 50 million years ago...|$|R
40|$|The <b>satellite</b> I <b>DNAs</b> of {{domestic}} goat (Capra hircus) and domestic sheep (Ovis aries) {{have been studied}} using molecular hybridisation and restriction enzyme analysis. Both <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> are composed of repeat units of 820 base pairs in length, but their restriction maps, although similar, differ in certain respects. Thus the majority of sheep satellite I repeat units have two EcoRI sites and one AluI site, whereas the majority of goat satellite I repeat units have one EcoRI site and two AluI sites. The sheep satellite I repeat units with the two EcoRI sites are much more homogeneous than the repeats forming {{the remainder of the}} satellite, as judged by the difference in the melting temperatures of native and reassociated molecules. DNAs from species of wild sheep and goats were screened for the presence of these repeat units, and they appear to have been amplified during the radiation of the Ovis genus. Goat satellite I is composed of a single sequence type which has changed through base substitution until the sequence now shows considerable heterogeneity. It is proposed that the major sequence types of these two <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> were amplified by different saltatory replication events at different times {{in the evolution of the}} group...|$|R

40|$|The entirely {{heterochromatic}} Y chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster {{contains a}} series of simple sequence <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> which together account for about 80 % of its length. Molecular cloning of the three simple sequence <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs</b> of D. melanogaster (1. 672, 1. 686 and 1. 705 g/ml) revealed that each satellite comprises several distinct repeat sequences. Together 11 related sequences were identified and 9 of them were shown to be located on the Y chromosome. In the present study we have finely mapped 8 of these sequences along the Y by in situ hybridization on mitotic chromosome preparations. The hybridization experiments were performed on {{a series of}} cytologically determined rearrangements involving the Y chromosome. The breakpoints of these rearrangements provided an array of landmarks along the Y which have been used to localize each sequence on the various heterochromatic blocks defined by Hoechst and N-banding techniques. The results of this analysis indicate a good correlation between the N-banded regions and 1. 705 repeats and between the Hoechst-bright regions and the 1. 672 repeats. However, the molecular basis for banding does not appear to depend exclusively on DNA content, since heterochromatic blocks showing identical banding patterns often contain different combinations of satellite repeats. The distribution of satellite repeats has also been analyzed with respect to the male fertility factors of the Y chromosome. Both loop-forming (kl- 5, kl- 3 and ks- 1) and non-loop-forming (kl- 2 and ks- 2) fertility genes contain substantial amounts of <b>satellite</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Moreover, each fertility region is characterized by a specific combination of satellite sequences rather than by an homogeneous array of a single type of repeat.
