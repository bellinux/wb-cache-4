30|$|A mobile <b>sink</b> {{is usually}} driven by fuel and/or electricity; that is why, the total travel {{distance}} {{covered by the}} <b>sink</b> throughout the network lifetime should be bounded. When a mobile <b>sink</b> moves from one <b>sink</b> location to another, the probability of data loss is high; so, the distance between two <b>sink</b> locations should be at minimum. Adaptive <b>sink</b> mobility requires that the <b>sink</b> must re-construct the routing table or routing tree at each new location, which takes a specific time. So, a mobile <b>sink</b> should reside for a minimum amount of time at each <b>sink</b> location. The transmission of data from nodes/CHs to a <b>sink</b> only occurs when the <b>sink</b> is not moving, i.e., <b>sink</b> is located at any <b>sink</b> location. Therefore, the sum of stop times in a mobile <b>sink</b> tour should be maximized. There should be a maximum number of stop locations for a mobile <b>sink</b> so that the throughput is maximized.|$|R

5|$|In metapopulation terminology, {{migrating}} {{individuals are}} classed as emigrants (when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites are classed either as sources or <b>sinks.</b> A {{site is a}} generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of juveniles that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., <b>sinks)</b> are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are <b>sinks</b> in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure.|$|E

2500|$|A pin fin heat <b>sink</b> is a heat <b>sink</b> {{that has}} pins that extend from its base. The pins can be cylindrical, {{elliptical}} or square. A pin {{is one of}} the more common heat <b>sink</b> types available on the market. [...] A second type of heat <b>sink</b> fin arrangement is the straight fin. These run the entire length of the heat <b>sink.</b> A variation on the straight fin heat <b>sink</b> is a cross cut heat <b>sink.</b> A straight fin heat <b>sink</b> is cut at regular intervals.|$|R
30|$|In this subsection, {{we propose}} a {{mathematical}} model of <b>sink</b> mobility mobile <b>sink</b> model (MSM) in which we take a single <b>sink</b> that can move to certain <b>sink</b> locations in every round. <b>Sink</b> locations are determined {{at the start of}} every round in our proposed model, in order to increase the network lifetime. Therefore, this model is an adaptive <b>sink</b> mobility model.|$|R

30|$|Strategy 2 : The sensors {{send their}} {{reports to the}} Manager <b>sink</b> node. Hence, the Manager <b>sink</b> node multicasts its report to the Classifier and the Prioritizer <b>sink</b> nodes. Consequently, each <b>sink</b> node in the Multi-Functional layer (Manager, Classifier, and Prioritizer) sends its report to the upper layer (General <b>sink</b> node), see Fig.  3.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. When {{communication}} in sensor networks occurs over wireless links, confidential {{information about the}} communication patterns between sensor nodes could be leaked even when encryption is used to protect the actual contents of the messages. The communication patterns, which often reveal higher volumes of traffic near the <b>sink,</b> could allow an attacker to identify {{the vicinity of the}} <b>sink</b> node. With this information, an attacker could potentially disable the network by destroying the <b>sink.</b> In this paper, we present the decoy <b>sink</b> protocol, which protects the location of the <b>sink</b> in target tracking sensor network applications by forwarding data to a decoy <b>sink</b> for aggregation before the aggregated data is forwarded to the real <b>sink</b> from the decoy <b>sink.</b> Combining indirection and data aggregation in our protocol creates more traffic away from the <b>sink</b> and reduces the amount of traffic near the <b>sink,</b> which makes traffic analysis more difficult for attackers...|$|R
5|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{and printed}} circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity; heat <b>sinks</b> and heat exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties. Electromagnets, vacuum tubes, cathode ray tubes, and magnetrons in microwave ovens use copper, as do waveguides for microwave radiation.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{principal}} {{approaches to the}} design of the heat <b>sinks</b> that collect the moisture in air wells: high mass, radiative and active. Early in the twentieth century, there was interest in high-mass air wells, but despite much experimentation including the construction of massive structures, this approach proved to be a failure.|$|E
5|$|Titan's {{components}} are air-cooled by heat <b>sinks,</b> {{but the air}} is chilled before being pumped through the cabinets. Fan noise is so loud that hearing protection is required for people spending more than 15 minutes in the machine room. The system has a cooling capacity of 23.2 MW (6600 tons) and works by chilling water to 5.5 °C (42 °F), which in turn cools recirculated air.|$|E
5|$|Bajar dengan Djiwa {{follows the}} {{interactions}} of several groups of people. Husband and wife Basuki (Zonder) and Suryati (Nji Soelastri) clash because of their different personalities: the former is a thinker concerned {{with the state of}} society, while the latter only thinks of herself. Meanwhile, Umar (Oedjang) and Supini (RS Fatimah) clash over Umar's wasteful nature; eventually, he <b>sinks</b> so far into debt that he must sell his daughter, Djuliah (Djoewariah), to a loan shark named Asnan (O. Parma), a move which breaks the heart of Djuliah's boyfriend Ruhiyat (A Bakar). Other scenes include comic interactions between two servants, Icah (Ijem) and Djemblug (Komung).|$|E
40|$|A large {{proportion}} of corporate bonds contain a <b>sinking</b> fund provision. The wide use of <b>sinking</b> funds has prompted both theoretical and empirical investigations. However, none has provided a satisfactory explanation {{for the existence of}} a <b>sinking</b> fund provision. The signalling implications of <b>sinking</b> funds is examined, and it is shown that, under information asymmetry, the <b>sinking</b> fund amortization rate provides a credible signal for the quality of the firm. In a separating equilibrium, better quality firms choose higher <b>sinking</b> fund amortization rates in their bond issues. A latent index model is proposed for testing the hypothesis of <b>sinking</b> fund signalling. The empirical evidence indicates that the <b>sinking</b> fund amortization rate signals the credit quality of the firm...|$|R
3000|$|... 0, it harvests {{data from}} that minimum energy CH. If a node has a <b>sink</b> {{location}} in its communication range then it sends {{the data to}} the <b>sink</b> when it reaches that location; otherwise, it sends the data to its nearest CH. The node waits for the <b>sink</b> at the closest <b>sink</b> stop, in case where more than one <b>sink</b> location is in its communication range. The same happens with the CHs in every round; each CH checks for the <b>sink</b> locations and finds the closest location to it and then sends its aggregated data when the <b>sink</b> reaches that closest location.|$|R
5000|$|Kambala <b>sank</b> in 1909. The {{reason and}} {{location}} of this <b>sinking</b> is unclear. Some reports have the submarine <b>sinking</b> near Kronstadt due to an erroneously opened valve while others have her <b>sinking</b> in an accidental collision with the [...] near Sevastopol. It has even been suggested that she <b>sank</b> twice first near Kronstadt then after being salvaged was sunk again near Sevastopol.|$|R
5|$|Final Fantasy XI has {{a largely}} player-based economy, {{with a heavy}} {{reliance}} on auction houses {{in each of the}} major cities of Vana'diel. There are certain economic controls in place mainly in the form of fees for putting items up for auction. Transportation, auction house, item storage, and fees do not go to players; these gil <b>sinks</b> effectively remove money from the economy to prevent inflation. The city of Jeuno used to levy a tax on bazaar purchases inside the city, but it was removed in a patch in the December 2008 version update.|$|E
5|$|Free {{oxygen gas}} was almost nonexistent in Earth's {{atmosphere}} before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 billion years ago. Free oxygen {{first appeared in}} significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago). For the first billion years, any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations. When such oxygen <b>sinks</b> became saturated, free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3–2.7billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Gertrude summons Hamlet to {{her room}} to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has {{possession}} of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He <b>sinks</b> to his knees. Hamlet, {{on his way to}} visit his mother, sneaks up behind him, but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a tapestry, makes a noise.|$|E
