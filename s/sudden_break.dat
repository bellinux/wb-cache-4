In the Orthodox view, the Assyrians and Orientals left the Orthodox Church in the years {{following}} the Third Ecumenical Council of Ephesus (431) and the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (451), respectively, in their refusal to accept those councils' Christological definitions. Similarly, the churches in Rome and Constantinople separated in an event known as the East–West Schism, traditionally dated to the year 1054, although it was more a gradual process than a <b>sudden</b> <b>break.</b> The Church of England separated from the Roman Catholic Church, not directly from the Orthodox Church, {{for the first time in}} the 1530s (and, after a brief reunion in 1555, again finally in 1558). Thus, though it was united to Orthodoxy when established through the work of Saint Augustine of Canterbury in the early 7th century, its separation from Orthodoxy came about indirectly through the See of Rome.|$|E

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between the Liddells and Dodgson suffered a <b>sudden</b> <b>break</b> in June 1863. There was no record of why the rift occurred, since the Liddells never openly spoke of it, and the single page in Dodgson's diary recording 27–29 June 1863 (which seems to cover {{the period in which}} it began) was missing; it has been speculated by biographers such as Morton N. Cohen that Dodgson may have wanted to marry the 11-year-old Alice Liddell, and that this was the cause of the unexplained break with the family in June 1863. Alice Liddell's biographer, Anne Clark, writes that Alice's descendants were under the impression that Dodgson wanted to marry her, but that [...] "Alice's parents expected a much better match for her." [...] Clark argues that in Victorian England such arrangements were not as improbable as they might seem; John Ruskin, for example, {{fell in love with a}} 12-year-old girl while Dodgson's younger brother sought to marry a 14-year-old, but postponed the wedding for six years.|$|E

For the propose of this thesis, we use weekly time series of Chinese and U. S. stock markets, covering the period of 2000 ~ 2014 years. And then, the primary aim will be fulfilled by 3 steps. In first stage, in order to detecting <b>sudden</b> <b>breaks</b> in both stock markets, we will utilize data samples with a help of the Iterated Cumulative Sums of Squares or ICSS algorithm. In this thesis, Chinese stock market is represented by Shenzhen Component Index, while American stock market is approximated by Dow Jones Industrial Average or DJIA Index. Next step, we will evaluate an impact of <b>sudden</b> <b>breaks</b> on volatility persistence or long memory, by using General Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) mdoel and Fractional Integrated General Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (FIGARCH) models. Finally, {{there will be an}} in-sample test for fitting degree.

40|$|<b>Sudden</b> pipe <b>breaks</b> {{occur in}} water {{transmission}} pipelines and distribution mains. The {{consequences of these}} breaks can be very expensive because of the service interruption, the cost of repair, and damage to surrounding property and infrastructure. The {{costs associated with the}} pipeline breaks can be reduced by minimizing the break detection and location time. This paper presents a new continuous monitoring approach for detecting and locating breaks in pipelines. A <b>sudden</b> pipe <b>break</b> creates a negative pressure wave that travels in both directions away from the break point and is reflected at the pipeline boundaries. Using the pressure data measured at one location along the pipeline, the timing of the initial and reflected transient waves induced by the break determines the location of the break. The magnitude of the transient wave provides an estimate of the break size. The continuous monitoring technique uses a modified two-sided cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm to detect abrupt break-induced changes in the pressure data. The adaptive tuning of CUSUM parameters is implemented to detect breaks of differing sizes and opening times. The continuous monitoring technique is verified by using results from both laboratory and field experiments and shows potential for detecting and locating <b>sudden</b> <b>breaks</b> in real pipelines.
