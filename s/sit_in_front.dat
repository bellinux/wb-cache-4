5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1886, Macdonald {{traveled}} for the only time to western Canada, traveling {{from town to town}} by private railway car, and addressing large crowds. Macdonald traveled with his wife, and to get a better view, the two would sometimes <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the locomotive on the train's cowcatcher. On 13 August 1886, Macdonald used a silver hammer and pounded a gold spike to complete the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway.|$|E
5|$|Falstaff, Shallow and Silence <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a warm fire, {{continuing}} {{from the}} first scene of the film. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning. Falstaff becomes ecstatic and goes directly to the castle, thinking that he will become a great and powerful nobleman under King Henry V. At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain his excitement and interrupts the entire ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims {{that he is now}} finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff looks up at Hal with a mixture of pride and despair, the new king banishes Falstaff. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, stating that he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying that he died of a broken heart. The narrator explains that Hal {{went on to become a}} good and noble king.|$|E
5|$|Vito Spatafore is outed as {{homosexual}} {{after running}} into {{a friend at}} a New York gay night club. The rumor spreads quickly, and once word gets to Meadow that everyone else knows, she tells Tony and Carmela about the incident between Finn and Vito with the security guard. Finn then has to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Tony's entire crew {{and tell them what}} happened with the guard, solidifying their thoughts on Vito's sexuality. Tony is urged {{to deal with the problem}} by Phil Leotardo, now acting boss of New York with Johnny Sack in prison. Once Vito is outed, he runs away from the city and hides out in a New Hampshire town where he claims to be writing a book and meets with the locals. Vito also starts a romantic relationship with a male cook at a local diner. Eventually, Vito returns to New Jersey and asks Tony to allow him to return to work, albeit in Atlantic City. He continues to maintain that he is not a homosexual. Tony mulls over the decision to let him work, as well as whether to let him live. When Tony fails to act, Phil intervenes and kills Spatafore. When one of the members of the New York family, Fat Dom Gamiello, pays a visit to the Jersey office and won't stop making jokes about Vito and his death, the two members of Tony's crime family who are present kill Fat Dom out of anger at the disrespect he has shown. Once more, it appears that the families are on the verge of all-out war.|$|E

25|$|An astrologer {{claimed that}} he was able to {{ascertain}} a person's astrological sign after talking with them for a few minutes. He was presented with twelve people, one at a time, each with a different astrological sign. They could not tell the astrologer their astrological sign or birth date, nor could they wear anything that would indicate it. After the astrologer talked to them, he had them go and <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the astrological sign that the astrologer thought was theirs. By agreement, the astrologer needed to get ten of the 12 correct, to win. He got none correct.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, a {{confrontation}} broke {{out between the}} student protesters and the police {{when a group of}} female students went to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the monks who were on hunger strike. The police misinterpreted the move as the students attempting to push through the line and came charging toward the students. The issue was later resolved when student leaders came to calm down the situation. Earlier that day, students negotiated with Bago Region Border and Security Affairs Minister Col. Thet Htun who urged them to halt their march. The students offered a compromise and stated that they would disperse in Yangon if the minister agreed on the eight-point conditions: to march to Tharawaddy, the nearest town; to fly banners and use megaphones after they embarked on vehicles to Yangon; and to have the police forces keep a distance from them. However, they did not receive any response from the minister.|$|E

25|$|The Mayflower Grandstand is the club's main stand, {{with space}} for about 7,000 spectators. It {{is the oldest}} part of the ground, having been built in 1952. It houses the club's main offices, the boardroom, team {{changing}} rooms and press rooms, and also accommodates executive boxes, which can host functions and are available to supporters on match days. The dugouts, which are made of wood and supplied by the club's sponsors, <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the Mayflower, with the player tunnel slightly off centre going underneath the Mayflower. To {{the rear of the}} stand is the Club Shop, selling official merchandise, and the Pyramid Suite, a hospitality area which can cater for up to 170 people. There are two structures overlooking the pitch {{on each side of the}} stand. To the east is a building which contains a hospitality area (the Chisholm Lounge), and a press area, and to the west is a disabled enclosure. There have been plans to replace this stand for a number of years. In 2013, planning permission was finally given to revamp and rebuild the Mayflower Grandstand after becoming less popular with supporters and the club's chairman James Brent, although no date has ever been set for the construction to begin.|$|E
500|$|The French anatomist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville first {{identified}} the two lateral {{teeth of the}} lemuriform toothcomb as canines in 1840. [...] Canine teeth are normally used to pierce or grasp objects. [...] With modified lower canine teeth, the first lower premolars following the toothcomb are usually shaped like typical canine teeth (caniniform) and assume their function. These premolars are commonly confused with canines. [...] Normally the true canines in the lower jaw <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the upper canines, and in toothcombed primates, the caniniform premolars rest behind it.|$|E

Citing a need to [...] "clean up" [...] the campus during graduation of 1991, President Day attempted to paint over the now symbolic construction fence wall. The night before the attempted wall paint over by President Day, a large police force arrested eight students peacefully {{sitting in front of}} the wall.

Singer Thom Yorke said the band had felt that [...] "if we are gonna carry on, {{we need to do}} it for a new set of reasons." [...] Cover artist Stanley Donwood said: [...] "In Rainbows was very much a definitive statement, and that isn't where the band are at the moment. Where they are now is more transitory ... this album shows where Radiohead are at the moment the record was released. The music is a continuing thing. And we wanted to make the album representative of that." [...] Multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood told Rolling Stone that the band had not wanted to [...] "pick up guitars and write chord sequences. We didn't want to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a computer either. We wanted a third thing, which involved playing and programming." ...|$|E

Ticket buyers were given a free copy of the film's soundtrack on CD. Although actress Robyn Paris described the audience laughing at the film, Variety reporter Scott Foundas, who was also in attendance, would later write that the film prompted [...] "most of its viewers to ask for their money back — before even 30 minutes [...] passed." [...] IFC.com described Wiseau's speaking voice in the film as [...] "Borat trying to do an impression of Christopher Walken playing a mental patient." [...] The Guardian described the film as a mix of [...] "Tennessee Williams, Ed Wood, R. Kelly's Trapped in the Closet".|$|E

Mesmer made [...] "passes", moving his hands from patients' shoulders [...] down along their arms. He then pressed {{his fingers on}} the patient's [...] hypochondrium region (the area below the diaphragm), sometimes holding his hands there for hours. Many patients felt peculiar sensations or had convulsions that were regarded as crises and supposed to bring about the cure. Mesmer would often conclude his treatments by playing some music on a glass armonica.|$|E

2500|$|Diagnosis is {{achieved}} through several related methods. One approach involves having patients <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> {{of a computer}} screen, on which either stars or triangles are projected simultaneously in {{different areas of the}} screen. [...] Patients are then asked to identify the locations and identities of the shapes. [...] Another similar approach is to project colored letters on the screen, again asking patients to identify the letter and color {{in different parts of the}} screen. [...] From this [...] information, a diagnosis of visual extinction can be attained. [...] A positive diagnosis results from a patient's inability to correctly identify shapes or letters projected simultaneously in different areas of the screen. However, the most common test for visual extinction is the finger confrontation model. In this test, the doctor asks the patient to note which of his hands have moving fingers. This can be used immediately following a stroke, for the doctor’s quick diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, {{producer}} Vinton Freedley {{came up with}} a {{new approach}} to producing musicals. Instead of commissioning book, music and lyrics and then casting the show, Freedley sought to create an ideal musical with stars and writers all engaged from the outset. The stars he wanted were Ethel Merman, William Gaxton and comedian Victor Moore. He planned a story about a shipwreck and a desert island, and for the book he turned to P. G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton. For the songs, he decided on Porter. By telling each of these that he had already signed the others, Freedley gathered his ideal team together. A drastic last-minute rewrite was necessitated by a major shipping accident, which dominated the news and made Bolton and Wodehouse's book seem tasteless. Nevertheless, the show, Anything Goes, was an immediate hit. Porter wrote what is thought by many to be his greatest score of this period. The New Yorker magazine said, [...] "Mr. Porter is in class by himself", and Porter himself subsequently called it one of his two perfect shows, along with the later Kiss Me, Kate. Its songs include [...] "I Get a Kick Out of You", [...] "All Through the Night", [...] "You're the Top" [...] (one of his best-known list songs), and [...] "Blow, Gabriel, Blow", as well as the title number. The show ran for 420 performances in New York (a particularly long run in the 1930s) and 261 in London. [...] Porter, despite his lessons in orchestration from d'Indy, did not orchestrate his musicals. Anything Goes was orchestrated by Robert Russell Bennett and Hans Spialek. Now {{at the height of his}} success, Porter was able to enjoy the opening night of his musicals; he would make a grand entrance and <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> apparently relishing the show as much as any audience member. Russel Crouse commented, [...] "Cole's opening-night behaviour is as indecent as that of a bridegroom who has a good time at his own wedding." ...|$|E
