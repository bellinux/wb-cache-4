40|$|The {{scientific}} study of the medicinal effects of thermal waters is known as balneology, or balneotherapy when applied in a medical context. In this literature-based article, {{the need for an}} up-to-date balneological classification of thermal spring waters in South Africa is highlighted. While balneotherapy is still not fully recognized at a global level, it has, over the past few centuries, evolved into a medical speciality in some countries. The effects of balneotherapy on the human body can be categorised into three broad areas, namely chemical effects, thermal effects and mechanical effects. Today there are about 30 thermal spring resorts spread around South Africa, but {{there is no longer any}} direct medicinal/balneological use of thermal spring waters in the country. Kent (1952) classified most of the best known thermal springs in South Africa into the following balneological water types: Indifferent waters, chalybeatic <b>waters,</b> alkaline <b>waters,</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>waters,</b> salt waters, triple waters, silicious waters, lithium waters and sulphur waters. While detailed chemical analyses of most thermal springs in South Africa have taken place in recent years, these do not include balneological analysis. Many medical specialists, such as rheumatologists and dermatologists, now acknowledge the medical significance of balneotherapy. An updated balneological classification of South Africa's thermal springs, and indeed those of the many other African countries that have thermal water resources, could go a long way towards enabling these countries to establish themselves as part of the growing international health tourism industry.

40|$|In {{the last}} twelve years, Mt. Etna, located in eastern Sicily, has {{produced}} {{a great number of}} explosive eruptions. Volcanic plumes have risen to several km above sea level and created problems for aviation and the communities living near the volcano. A reduction of hazards may be accomplished using remote sensing techniques to evaluate important features of volcanic plumes. Since 2000, the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) on board NASA s Terra spacecraft has been extensively used to study aerosol dispersal and to extract the three-dimensional structure of plumes coming from anthropogenic or natural sources, including volcanoes. In the present work, MISR data from several explosive events occurring at Etna are analyzed using a program named MINX (MISR INteractive eXplorer). MINX uses stereo matching techniques to evaluate the height of the volcanic aerosol with a precision of a few hundred meters, and extracts aerosol properties from the MISR Standard products. We analyzed twenty volcanic plumes produced during the 2000, 2001, 2002 - 03, 2006 and 2008 Etna eruptions, finding that volcanic aerosol dispersal and column height obtained by this analysis is in good agreement with ground-based observations. MISR aerosol type retrievals: (1) clearly distinguish volcanic plumes that are <b>sulphate</b> and/or <b>water</b> vapor dominated from ash-dominated ones; (2) detect even low concentrations of volcanic ash in the atmosphere; (3) demonstrate that <b>sulphate</b> and/or <b>water</b> vapor dominated plumes consist of smaller-sized particles compared to ash plumes.

The data from 17 monitored objects (subhorizontal mine galeries, springs and hydrogeological wells), which, with few exceptions, drain mainly Cenomanian aquifer (1 object in Orovician shales a 2 objects in Quaternary aquifer). For outflows from galeries and springs, statistics of the following parameters was calculated: discharge, pH, electric conductivity and water temperature. Discharge of all studied objects shows very low time variation. pH is neutral waters and overall, pH values show very low variability. Mean conductivity of studied objects suggests lower to moderate mineralization of waters. Groundwater temperature does not respond significantly to temperature changes at the surface. Marked temporary declines in water table leveal were probably caused by tunnel construction in proximity of the wells.

In addition, the forested areas underlain mainly with till and peat released low SO 4 2 - but low pH waters (down to at least 4. 6) during high flows, indicating the importance of humic acids in controlling the pH.

These industrial activities may result in significant radioactive contamination of (by-) products, wastes and plant installations. In this study, scale samples were collected from a decommissioned phosphoric acid processing plant. To determine the nature and concentration of NORM retained in pipe-work and associated process plant, four main areas of the site were investigated: (1) the 'Green Acid Plant', where crude acid was concentrated; (2) the green acid storage tanks; (3) the Purified White Acid (PWA) plant, where inorganic impurities were removed; and (4) the solid waste, disposed of on-site as landfill. The scale samples predominantly comprise the following: fluorides (e. g. ralstonite); calcium sulphate (e. g. gypsum); and an assemblage of mixed fluorides and phosphates (e. g. iron fluoride hydrate, calcium phosphate), respectively. The radioactive inventory is dominated by U- 238 and its decay chain products, and significant fractionation along the series occurs. Compared to the feedstock ore, elevated concentrations (<= 8. 8 Bq/g) of U- 238 Were found to be retained in installations where the process stream was rich in fluorides and phosphates. In addition, enriched levels (<= 11 Bq/g) of Ra- 226 were found in association with precipitates of calcium <b>sulphate.</b> <b>Water</b> extraction tests indicate that many of the scales and waste contain significantly soluble materials and readily release radioactivity into solution.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} {{conducted}} at Kanpur (26. 51 degrees N, 80. 23 degrees E), India, was to quantify chemical properties of dust and the intensity of mixing, due to its interaction with various emissions from anthropogenic activities, during its long range transport. Aerosol mass was collected at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) located in the Indo-Gangetic Plain from April-July 2011, a period marked by intense dust storms and onset of monsoon. The sampling days were classified as Dust, Polluted Dust(1) (PD 1), Polluted Dust(2) (PD 2) and Continental days. PM 10 (coarse mode) and PM 2. 5 (fine mode) collected on filter substrates were analysed for chemical composition. Elemental concentrations were measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The results show that crustal elements like Ca, Fe, K, Na and Mg were dominant in coarse mode during dusty days, whereas, elements of anthropogenic origin like Cu, Ni, Se and V were mostly concentrated in fine mode during PD 1 as well as PD 2. Very low elemental concentrations were found during continental days. SO 42 -, Cl- and NO 3 - were found to be high during PD 1 and PD 2 days. Very good correlations of NH 4 + with Cl- and SO 42 - ions in PD 1 days indicate their common sources of origin and formation of ammonium chloride and ammonium <b>sulphate.</b> <b>Water</b> Soluble Inorganic Carbon (WSIC) was found during all dust days, Water Soluble Organic Carbon (WSOC) was found to be highest during PD 1 and PD 2 day...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} long term {{exposure}} of full size bolts to corrosive environments is presented. A special test rig {{was used to}} test four bolts under different loading conditions. Four X-grade identical profile bolts, each 21 · 7 mm core diameter (23 · 7 mm full diameter) were subjected to prolonged corrosion testing using acid <b>sulphate</b> <b>water.</b> The pH value of the circulated water varied between 3 · 4 and 4 · 3. The corrosion exposure test period lasted 3 · 5 years. Two bolts were axially loaded to 10 t and 20 t force respectively, the third bolt was subjected to a 360 Nm torsion load and the fourth bolt was left unstressed to act as a reference bolt. After the test period ended, the bolts were stripped of their corroded coatings and weighted for weight loss. The diameter of each bolt was subsequently measured, and the loaded bolt samples were first tested nondestructively for tensile cracks and then tested for tensile failure. No cracks were found on postcorrosion bolts tested non-destructively. The failure strength reduction on all four post-corroded bolts was significant, varying between 21 and 39 %. The onset of corrosion was not confined to the water targeted mid-section length of the bolt, however, the most severe corrosion occurred at the anchored ends of the bolts, possibly attributed to the combination of several types of corrosion which may have been also compounded with increased surface area of the threading at the bolt ends and excessive aeration corrosion due to increase in air movement...|$|R
