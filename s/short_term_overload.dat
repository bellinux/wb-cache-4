40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is to {{determine}} the <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>overload</b> capability of Cable No. 116 in the event of the loss of one pole of the dc transmission system. Such a loss would result in the loss of 250 MW of transmitted power. This exceeds the spinning reserve capability of the Hawaiian Electric Company on Oahu. The maximum allowable first contingency power loss which can be accomodated by the available spinning reserve while maintaining the integrity of the system is 125 MW. The loss of one pole of the dc system would therefore require an increase of 50 percent in the transmitted power on the remaining pole for a period of time up to 4 hours. The surviving pole conductor during this period must therefore carry 150 percent of rated power, i. e. 375 MW corresponding to 1250 amps. The findings are included in this report...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{electric}} {{aspects of a}} linear synchronous permanent magnet generator. The generator is designed {{for use in a}} wave energy converter, which determines the fundamental requirements of the generator. The electromagnetic properties of the generator are investigated with a finite element based simulation tool. These simulations formed the base of the design and construction of a laboratory prototype. Several experiments where conducted on the prototype generator. The results verify at large the simulation tool. However, a difference between the measured and simulated air gap flux was discovered. This was attributed to the longitudinal ends of the generator, which are ignored in the simulation tool. Experiences from the construction, and further finite element studies, led to a significant change in the support structure of the first offshore prototype generator. A complete wave energy converter was constructed and launched, the 13 th of March, on the west coast of Sweden. A study of the load resistance impact on the power absorption has been carried out. An optimal load interval, with regard to power absorption, has been identified. Furthermore, the generator has proofed to withstand <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>overload</b> several times larger than the nominal load. Finally, the longitudinal ends’ influence on the flux distribution was investigated with an analytical model, as well as finite element simulations. A possible problem with large induction of eddy currents in the actuator back steel was identified. This work is a part of a larger project, which aims do develop a viable wave energy conversion system...|$|E
40|$|Part 7 : Energy: ManagementInternational audienceThe {{low voltage}} (LV) {{distribution}} cable networks were installed some decades ago {{but the new}} paradigm in electric power engineering generates new requirements from these old assets. The distributed generation, storage and new appliances can cause high variation of load and reverse power flow, nevertheless the LV cable grid was not designed to these new stresses. The aggregate load and generation can surpass the rated capacity of the cable lines causing <b>short</b> <b>term</b> temperature increasing. This temperature stress can decrease the expected lifetime of the cable lines. In this study the <b>short</b> <b>term</b> thermal <b>overload</b> of LV distribution cables was investigated. The experiments were executed on PVC insulated LV cable samples and electrical and mechanical properties of the cable jacket were investigated. The effect of these short-term overloads on the expected lifetime of cables is introduced and non-destructive measurement for tracking {{the effect of the}} <b>short</b> <b>term</b> thermal <b>overloads</b> on the cable is suggested...|$|R

The most significant advantages of these PowerformerTM are their direct connection to high-voltage grid, higher availability, and more reactive power margin, <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>overloading</b> capacity and removing the power transformer from the structure of the power plant. In this paper, the installation effect of these generators on the power system reliability is investigated. The amount of the effects depends on the type and location of the power plant, location of the PowerformerTM, the size of load and network topology. For this purpose, in the 6 -bus IEEE RBTS system, the conventional generators are replaced by these new PowerformerTM and then, the reliability indices are evaluated. The simulation results show that the reliability indices such as the expected duration of load curtailment (EDLC) and the expected energy not served (EENS) are improved. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} a high voltage generator Powerformer™ on the composite system reliability. The Powerformer™ is directly connected to the high voltage side of the grid; it has higher availability, more reactive power margin, and extra <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>overloading</b> capacity. Its impacts are compared with the existing conventional generators using the 24 -bus IEEE-RTS test system. A number of sensitivity analyses are performed and the results are presented. It has been observed that the improvement in the steady state adequacy is largely attributed to its higher availabilities. Importantly its impacts depend on its location, load level and the system topologies. In some cases system indices may improve while load point indices may not or the vice versa. From its presence the buses with major loads and networked in mesh benefit better than the one connected radially and with little load. Its extra reactive power margin has relatively less impact on the adequacy but reduces number of voltage violations...|$|R
40|$|The thick-film {{technology}} {{is one of}} the fundamental technologies for the production of circuit carriers for electronic modules. It is mainly used in areas with harsh environmental conditions, such as sensor or automotive applications. Basis of the thick film technology are glass-based pastes, which are screen printed on ceramic substrates and fired in a high temperature process at (500 … 1000) ° C. Such thick film pastes are commercially available from various suppliers as elements of paste systems, which mainly include compatible isolation, resistance and conductive pastes. There are a number of requirements according the fired thick film characteristics, such as high breakdown voltage of isolation thick films or low noise performances of resistance thick films. However, the most requirements are concentrating on conductor thick films. They should guarantee excellent properties in terms of assembling (soldering, bonding) which are focused in a many publications. Simultaneously, they should also offer very good electrical characteristics that have not been completely investigated until today. At Fraunhofer IKTS different measurement methods are developed and adapted to characterize the electrical performance of thick film structures. Already well known is the <b>short</b> <b>term</b> <b>overload</b> (STOL) measurement of thick film resistances, which determining the maximum power dissipation of the thick film structure. The basic concept of this measurement is adapted on conductive thick film structures like conductive tracks or vias. The investigations show correlations between geometrical thick film properties and the resulting thermal characteristics of the thick film structure. Results can be used to improve screen-printing layouts in terms of cost reduction (paste consumption) and thermal management (track width, via diameter), but can also help to improve paste compositions itself. The paper will give an overview of the used electrical measurement methods and present exemplary results...|$|E
