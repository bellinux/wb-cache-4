Banton's shouts {{attract the attention of}} Patrick Newirth, a guest in the room across the hall. When Newirth looks through his room door's peephole, Banton <b>steps</b> <b>back,</b> causing his body shadow slips beneath the door. Newirth suddenly evaporates, leaving a strange burn mark on the floor. Banton realizes what has happened and flees the scene.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} match, Carlito faced Mankind, who {{was chosen by}} the fans' vote with 52%. The match began when Carlito {{performed}} a dropkick on Mankind. However, Mankind got the advantage over Carlito. Midway through the match, Mankind tried to use a steel chair on Carlito, but Carlito avoided, executeing drop toe-hold, sending Mankind into the steel steps. Mankind rose to his feet, which led Carlito to perform a standing dropkick, resulting in Mankind to hit {{the back of his}} head into the steel <b>steps.</b> <b>Back</b> in the ring, Mankind received the upper hand after delivering a DDT and forced Carlito to submit with the Mandible claw and win the match.|$|E

5|$|After {{spending}} the night together, Tosh and Tommy return to the hospital as the disruptions intensify, accompanied by Jack. During one disruption, the three witness the 1918 Torchwood team; Jack relays instructions through Tommy {{for them to take}} the 1918 version of Tommy into their custody before the older Tommy arrives. Tommy and Tosh share a goodbye, and Jack briefs Tommy on using the Rift Key before he <b>steps</b> <b>back</b> to 1918 during the next disruption. However, when back in the past, Tommy becomes shell-shocked, and is led back to his bed by nurses; he is unable to operate the Rift Key in his state. At Torchwood's headquarters, Jack and Tosh use the Cardiff Rift to project an image of Tosh into Tommy's mind. Tommy senses some familiarity with Tosh but otherwise does not recognise her. Despite this, Tosh is able to instruct Tommy to activate the Rift Key, and the distortions at the hospital soon dissipate. Recovering from events, Tosh brushes off Owen's sympathy and takes a moment to consider her short time with Tommy.|$|E
5|$|In the fleet, President Roslin (Mary McDonnell) burns {{her book}} of Pythia, and {{is unable to}} address the fleet because of feeling that she led the fleet nowhere, and believing the prophecy is a lost cause. Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) and Anastasia Dualla (Kandyse McClure) revisit their relationship, and after their evening together, Dualla returns to her quarters, and commits suicide. Devastated by this, Admiral Adama acquires a handgun from a Marine and {{attempts}} to coerce Tigh (Michael Hogan) into killing him, which fails. Adama breaks down relieved and converses with Tigh about past memories, and Tigh reminding Adama of his duties as commander of the fleet. Adama eventually <b>steps</b> <b>back</b> into the CIC, and makes an announcement that he will find {{a home for the}} fleet, gives instructions to search for any nearby habitable star systems, and invites their new Cylon allies to join them. As the fleet prepares to leave Earth, which is determined to be uninhabitable, D'Anna (Lucy Lawless), devastated by the knowledge that history repeats itself endlessly, decides to remain on Earth to die, rather than being hunted by Cavil.|$|E
5|$|With Lenin now {{based in}} Geneva, the {{arguments}} between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks continued after the conference. The Bolsheviks accused their rivals of being opportunists and reformists who lacked any discipline, while the Mensheviks accused Lenin {{of being a}} despot and autocrat, comparing him to Maximilien de Robespierre. When Plekhanov sided with Martov, Lenin flew into a rage and resigned from both the Iskra editorial board and the Party Council. In May 1904, he published One Step Forward, Two <b>Steps</b> <b>Back,</b> a booklet claiming that Martov's supporters had tricked him into this. The stress added to an illness, {{which at the time}} was probably diagnosed as neurasthenia, and to relive this, he went on a climbing holiday in the countryside in June. Some party members attempted to reunite the feuding factions, but this failed, and by the spring, all eight members of the Central Committee were Bolsheviks. In December, they founded a Bolshevik newspaper, Vperëd (Forward).|$|E

25|$|Actual {{attacks on}} humans are rare, {{but can be}} serious, {{resulting}} in multiple penetrating injuries to {{the lower part of}} the body. They generally occur during the boars' rutting season from November–January, in agricultural areas bordering forests or on paths leading through forests. The animal typically attacks by charging and pointing its tusks towards the intended victim, with most injuries occurring on the thigh region. Once the initial attack is over, the boar <b>steps</b> <b>back,</b> takes position and attacks again if the victim is still moving, only ending once the victim is completely incapacitated.|$|E

For Oseh shalom it is customary take three <b>steps</b> <b>back</b> (if possible) then bow to one's left, then to one's right, and finally bow forward, as if taking leave of the presence of a king, {{in the same way as}} when the same words are used as the concluding line of the Amidah.|$|E
25|$|Observant Jews {{have the}} custom to take three <b>steps</b> <b>back</b> and then three steps forward {{both before and}} after reciting the Amidah. The steps {{backward}} at the beginning represent withdrawing one's attention from the material world, and then stepping forward to symbolically approach the King of Kings. The Mekhilta notes that the significance of the three steps is based on the three barriers that Moses had to pass through at Sinai before entering God's realm. The Mishnah Berurah wrote that only the steps forward are necessary, while the backward steps beforehand are a prevalent custom.|$|E
25|$|Tamzara is an Armenian, Assyrian, Azerbaijani and Greek folk dance {{native to}} Anatolia.

Like most Anatolian folk dances, Tamzara is done with a large group of people with interlocked pinkies.|$|E

25|$|When the rut begins, rams {{begin to}} fight for {{dominance}} among their flocks; dominant rams then choose their ewes without competition from the losers. Only mature rams (those over 6 years old) fight for dominance. The young will sometimes threaten older males, but never charge them. The mature rams fight by standing {{next to each other}} and spinning around, then one <b>steps</b> <b>back</b> and charges. O. a. polii males have been noted to rise up on their hind legs when they clash with opponents, which is not common in lowland sheep and similar to the fighting habits of goats. The males commonly emit grunts while fighting and often chip their horns or break their noses.|$|E
25|$|The fifth match pitted Kurt Angle against Chris Benoit. The match {{started with}} mat wrestling {{between the two}} but Angle soon punched Benoit out of {{frustration}} and threw {{him out of the}} ring, so he could throw him into the broadcast table and the steel <b>steps.</b> <b>Back</b> in the ring, both men tried to submit their opponent using the other's signature hold with Benoit using the ankle lock on Angle, and Angle using the Crippler Crossface on Benoit. Benoit eventually succeeded in forcing Angle to tap out to the Crippler Crossface but the referee was knocked down and didn't see it. Near the end of the match, Benoit tried to pin Angle after a diving headbutt but was met with a two-count. Angle then quickly rolled-up up Benoit, using the tights for leverage to win the match.|$|E

The Weyland–Yutani team shoot Morse in the leg in a late effort to stop him; Aaron strikes the Bishop look-a-like with a wrench and is shot dead.

Ripley grabs it to prevent it from escaping as they both fall into the furnace. The facility is closed and Morse, the sole survivor, is led away as Ripley's recording from the first film plays for the final time in the EEV.|$|E

500|$|Joe Fielder of GameSpot gave Soul Reaver 2 a {{score of}} 8.8 and called it an {{excellent}} sequel, again praising the change to elemental puzzles and the combat system, but criticizing the dearth of sidequests and boss fights, {{and the lack of}} definite resolution to the storyline. Electronic Gaming Monthlys reviewer said that it triumphed as an aesthetic showcase, but deemed its gameplay mediocre and unappealing. The reviewer for Game Informer regarded Soul Reaver 2 as [...] "quite engrossing". Star Dingo of GamePro similarly praised its graphics, sound design and voice acting, but condemned missed creative opportunities concerning the potential of the spectral realm and time travel, saying that the game [...] "takes as many <b>steps</b> <b>back</b> as it does forward, and ends up teetering precariously over the brink of being a disappointment". The review concurred with IGN that the plot and dialogue, though entertaining, sometimes bordered on pretentiousness, and Game Revolution's Duke Ferris repeatedly compared the story to a soap opera.|$|E
