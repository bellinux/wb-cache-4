5000|$|Expanding beyond Bandura's three steps, Dale Schunk and Barry Zimmerman, two {{educational}} psychologists, have collaborated and {{researched the}} effects of social and instructional variables on self-regulation. They have reviewed how specific strategies enhance individual learning processes and how it orients toward self-regulation and achievement processes including: self-observation, self-evaluation, <b>self-reaction,</b> and self-efficacy. Self-observation may be considered insufficient because motivation depends on one’s expectations of outcomes and efficacy. Self-evaluation is where an individual compares his or her current performance to a desired one. Schunk and Zimmerman state that [...] "specific goals specify the amount of effort required for success and boost self-efficacy because progress is easy to gauge." [...] They describe {{the two types of}} self-evaluation as absolute or normative. An example of an absolute standard is an academic grading scale, where as a normative standard would involve evaluating oneself's performance. When individuals achieve these valued goals, they're more likely to continue to exert a high level of effort since sub-standard performance will no longer provide satisfaction. <b>Self-reaction</b> is the third element, in which one can be motivated through reactions by others. For example, if one's performance received numerous positive acknowledgments, that individual may have a feeling of self-efficacy; whereas a negative self-evaluation would likely motivate an individual to work harder. <b>Self-reaction</b> also allows a person to re-evaluate his or her goals in conjunction with attainments. Lastly, self-efficacy is the belief that goal completion is enough motivation in it self, and can refer to how people have preconceived judgments about how they are able to perform certain tasks.|$|E

He created the triangle of reciprocal determinism that includes behavior, environment, and the person (cognitive, emotional, and physical factors) that all influence one another. Bandura concluded that the processes of goal attainment and motivation stem from an equal interaction of self-observation, <b>self-reaction,</b> self-evaluation, and self-efficacy.|$|E

Propargyl radical (2 -propyn- 1 -yl) is an alkyl radical with the structure H 3 C≡C–CH 2 ●. Because these radicals are resonance stabilised, their oxygen reactions are relatively slow.

In this work, the formation of imidazole, imidazole- 2 -carboxaldehyde, and 2, 2 -bis- 1 H-imidazole was investigated in the <b>self-reaction</b> of glyoxal and its cross-reactions with each of these compounds in aqueous solutions of inorganic ammonium salts at pH = 7. Such conditions are relevant both as cheap and environmentally-friendly synthetic procedures and for the chemistry of natural environments where NH 4 + is abundant, such as in atmospheric aerosols. These reactions were investigated both by H- 1 -NMR and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy at room temperature with the objective to determine the formation pathways of the three imidazoles and the parameters affecting their yields, to identify the optimal conditions for their synthesis. The results show that only the simplest imidazole is produced by the <b>self-reaction</b> of glyoxal and that imidazole- 2 -carboxaldehyde and 2, 2 -bis- 1 H-imidazole are produced by cross-reactions of glyoxal with imidazole and imidazole- 2 -carboxaldehyde, respectively. The yields of imidazole- 2 -carboxaldehyde and 2, 2 -bis- 1 H-imidazole formed by the cross-reactions were close to unity, but the yield of imidazole formed by the <b>self-reaction</b> of glyoxal, Y-Im, was small and varied inversely with the initial glyoxal concentration, [G](0) : Y-Im > 10 % only for [G](0) < 0. 1 M.

Peroxy radical-peroxy radical reactions have a strong effect on PAN concentrations and the atmospheric odd nitrogen balance under conditions of low nitric oxide concentrations. Box model simulations, counter species analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to determine the relative importance of the reactions of acetyl peroxy radical with nitric oxide, hydroperoxy radical, acetyl peroxy radical (<b>self-reaction),</b> methyl peroxy radical and other peroxy radicals and the effect of these reactions on PAN concentrations.

Subjects in the information training group received instruction about the physiological effects of cold water and the experimental measurement of physiological arousal. All subjects participated in two trials of the cold pressor task, one before and one after training. Measures of physiological arousal included electrodermal response (EDR), electromyograph (EMG), skin temperature (ST), heart rate (HR), and systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), which were measured at various points throughout the procedure. Self-report measures included the Self-Control Schedule, Self-Efficacy Scale, Pennebaker Inventory of Limbic Languidness, and a post-experimental questionnaire—all of which were completed post-experimentally. Results indicated that self-control training was effective in increasing tolerance duration over trials, and produced different patterns of physiological responding. The self-control group showed lower levels of EMG over trials and greater decreases in blood pressure after Trial 2, indicating that self-control training produced lower levels of arousal.

40|$|The {{reactions}} of the phosphoranyl radicals formed {{by the addition of}} tert-butoxy radicals to trimethyl, triethyl, triisopropyl, and tri-tert-butyl phosphite have been examined by epr spectroscopy. At temperatures below ca. - 1150 the t-BuO 1 ̆e 56 (OMe) 3 and t-BuO 1 ̆e 56 (OEt) 3 decay with second-order kinetics. At higher temperatures all four radicals decay with first-order kinetics to yield phosphate and a tert-butyl radical. The rates of this 3 ̆b 2 -scission reaction increase by about an order of magnitude at - 600 along the series from t-BuO 1 ̆e 56 (OMe) 3 to to (t-BuO) 4 P. Arrhenius parameters for 3 ̆b 2 -scission have been determined by kinetic epr spectroscopy and by a competitive procedure. The latter method has shown that tert-butyl radicals react with phosphoranyl radicals with rate constants that are approximately the geometric mean of the rate constants for the bimolecular <b>self-reactions</b> of the tert-butyl and phosphoranyl radicals. The mechanism of 3 ̆b 2 -scission is discussed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|SSCI-VIDE+CARE+LTI:SRS:CGOInternational audienceThis study {{presents}} the results of a set of laboratory experiments aiming at {{a better understanding of the}} role of the sea surface microlayer in the photochemical production of VOCs. Recently, we have shown that light driven reactions, in aqueous solutions containing a photosensitizer (P) in the presence of a surface organic microlayer, leads to the formation of various gaseous VOCs [...] The main VOCs produced, analysed by PTR/SRI-ToF-MS, were oxidized species, such as aldehydes, ketones and alcohols, as expected by the photo-oxidation of the organics at the air/water interface. However also alkenes, dienes and unsaturated aldehydes were detected and a reaction pathway, initiated by an H-abstraction of the surfactant by the excited P*, has been proposed. This mechanism infers that the presence of the surface microlayer will enhance protonation and <b>self-reactions,</b> leading to the formation of dimers, as confirmed by UPLC-HR-ESI-MS analysis. As most of these compounds were thought to be solely produced by biological activities, the existence of such interfacial photochemistry opensnew directions that will discussed...|$|R
