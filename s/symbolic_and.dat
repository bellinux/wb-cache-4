5|$|In the Sikh {{religious}} text the Guru Granth Sahib, religious {{language is}} used symbolically and metaphorically.

To overcome this, the Sikh Gurus used <b>symbolic</b> <b>and</b> metaphorical language, assuming that there is a resemblance between the mystical experience of the divine (the sabad) and those experiencing it. For example, light is used to refer to the spiritual reality.|$|E

5|$|Twentieth-century Reformed theologian Karl Barth did {{not follow}} the Reformed belief that sacraments are used by God as means of grace. Instead, he saw the Lord's Supper as purely <b>symbolic</b> <b>and</b> {{functioning}} to proclaim God's promises. His position has been called symbolic memorialism because he saw the sacraments function as memorializing Christ's death. Another twentieth-century Reformed theologian, Donald Baillie, took a position {{similar to that of}} John Calvin. Baillie argued that though God is omnipresent, he is present in a special way in the Lord's Supper because he is present by virtue of the believer's faith. Christ's presence is even more real to the believer in the sacrament than is physical reality.|$|E

Some commentators have criticised the evolutionary approach adopted by the court, and the court's resultant failure to find a certain date on which Australia became independent, arguing that the distinction is more than merely <b>symbolic</b> <b>and</b> could have real consequences. However, even Justice Callinan, who questioned the evolutionary approach in this case, affirmed in a later case (Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet) that the effect of the Australia Act in finally recognising independence could not be doubted.|$|E

5|$|During the Eastern Han, I Ching {{interpretation}} {{divided into}} two schools, originating {{in a dispute over}} minor differences between different editions of the received text. The first school, known as New Text criticism, was more egalitarian and eclectic, and sought to find <b>symbolic</b> <b>and</b> numerological parallels between the natural world and the hexagrams. Their commentaries provided the basis of the School of Images and Numbers. The other school, Old Text criticism, was more scholarly and hierarchical, and focused on the moral content of the text, providing the basis for the School of Meanings and Principles. The New Text scholars distributed alternate versions of the text and freely integrated non-canonical commentaries into their work, as well as propagating alternate systems of divination such as the Taixuanjing. Most of this early commentary, such as the image and number work of Jing Fang, Yu Fan and Xun Shuang, is no longer extant. Only short fragments survive, from a Tang dynasty text called Zhou yi jijie.|$|E
5|$|In 1846 Mickiewicz severed {{his ties}} with Towiański, {{following}} {{the rise of}} revolutionary sentiment in Europe, manifested in {{events such as the}} Kraków Uprising of February 1846. Mickiewicz criticized Towiański's passivity and returned to the traditional Catholic Church. In 1847 Mickiewicz befriended American journalist, critic and women's-rights advocate Margaret Fuller. In March 1848 he was part of a Polish delegation received in audience by Pope Pius IX, whom he asked to support the enslaved nations and the French Revolution of 1848. Soon after, in April 1848, he organized a military unit, the Mickiewicz Legion, to support the insurgents, hoping to liberate the Polish and other Slavic lands. The unit never became large enough to be more than <b>symbolic,</b> <b>and</b> in the fall of 1848 Mickiewicz returned to Paris and became more active again on the political scene.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, sacraments {{are held}} to be, along with the word of God preached, the means of grace. In the sacraments, God graciously condescends to use common {{material}} objects to communicate divine promises to people. The grace promised consists not only in benefits which God bestows on people, but Christ's person himself, to whom God unites the believer. Sacraments confirm or ratify the promises communicated in preaching. Both preaching and the sacraments are not merely <b>symbolic</b> <b>and</b> representative of the reality to which they refer, but actually create the reality of saving grace. The sacraments are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the promises signified in the sacraments. This efficacy is only beneficial, however, {{for those who have}} faith. The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient's response. Its effect is negative, resulting in judgement, for the faithless; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful.|$|E

It also seeks to define which features Grenouille possesses that can be seen as animalistic, and are comparable to features found in animals and familiar in animal <b>symbolics,</b> <b>and</b> which animals are used in these descriptions. The results show that Grenouille and his demeanor is largely described using animal metaphors, specifically the behaviors and characteristics of the tick, spider, snake, and frog, as well as mentions of animalistic features that do not belong to any specific animal species, such as Grenouille's predatory characteristics. Furthermore, there is a discussion of why these animal <b>symbolics</b> <b>and</b> metaphors are used in the text, and what purpose they serve. A short discussion whether Grenouille can be described as mostly man or beast, are also included in the study...|$|R

5|$|Peking opera {{features}} {{four main}} types of performers. Performing troupes often have several of each variety, {{as well as}} numerous secondary and tertiary performers. With their elaborate and colorful costumes, performers are the only focal points on Peking opera's characteristically sparse stage. They use the skills of speech, song, dance, and combat in movements that are <b>symbolic</b> <b>and</b> suggestive, rather than realistic. Above all else, the skill of performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements. Performers also adhere {{to a variety of}} stylistic conventions that help audiences navigate the plot of the production. The layers of meaning within each movement must be expressed in time with music. The music of Peking opera can be divided into the Xipi (西皮) and Erhuang (二黄) styles. Melodies include arias, fixed-tune melodies, and percussion patterns. The repertoire of Peking opera includes over 1,400 works, which are based on Chinese history, folklore, and, increasingly, contemporary life.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Paul Tillich {{argued that}} {{religious}} faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol {{points to a}} meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is <b>symbolic</b> <b>and</b> participates in {{the meaning of a}} concept. Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality. Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.|$|E

Furthermore, by the late 14th century, the fortress had become the repository of the Elector's valuables and archives.
