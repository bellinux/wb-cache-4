5|$|Forced {{to rely on}} UHF to expand, DuMont <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> station {{after another}} go dark due to dismal ratings. It bought small, distressed UHF station KCTY (channel 25) in Kansas City, Missouri in 1954, but ran it for just three months before {{shutting}} it down at a considerable loss after attempting to compete with three established VHF stations.|$|E
5|$|In the 1997 general election, one NCMP {{seat was}} offered to, and {{accepted}} by, J. B. Jeyaratnam. He was declared elected {{with effect from}} 14 January 1997. Subsequently, with effect from 23 July 2001, Jeyaretnam fell into bankruptcy due to an unpaid debt and thus lost his seat in Parliament. The general election that year <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> NCMP seat occupied by Steve Chia of the Singapore Democratic Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war. As {{part of the}} Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war, the ships were awarded to the victorious powers as war prizes. Kolberg was {{allocated}} to France, where she was commissioned into the French Navy as Colmar. Augsburg was transferred to Japanese control; having no use for her, they sold the ship for scrapping. Colmar <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> tour on colonial duty in Asia in 1924, where she participated in a multinational operation to protect foreign nationals from Chinese unrest in Shanghai. She was subsequently stricken in 1927 and broken up for scrap in Brest, France.|$|E

5|$|But within minutes, the Do 17 {{formation}} {{had been}} reduced to 15 aircraft and most of them were damaged. Six had been shot down and four were attempting to make a run for home. The remainder dropped their bombs and were met by a covering force of Bf 109s and landed back in France without further combat. LG 2 meanwhile had been and gone. They <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> rail station and released their bombs and returned home. They saw only one British fighter, No. 46 Squadron’s Pilot Officer Gunning who reported the make up of the formation. Park had decided to ignore their raid.|$|E
5|$|On 8 October 1996, 7 {{months after}} the {{escalation}} over Imia a Greek Mirage 2000 reportedly fired an R.550 Magic II missile and shot down a Turkish F-16D over the Aegean Sea. The Turkish pilot died, while the co-pilot ejected and was rescued by Greek forces. In August 2012, after the downing of a RF-4E on the Syrian Coast, Turkish Defence Minister İsmet Yılmaz confirmed that the Turkish F-16D was shot down by a Greek Mirage 2000 with an R.550 Magic II in 1996 after violating Greek airspace near Chios island. Greece denies that the F-16 was shot down. Both Mirage 2000 pilots reported that the F-16 caught fire and they <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> parachute.|$|E

5|$|Sunderland {{appeared}} {{in their first}} League Cup final in 1985, but lost 1–0 to Norwich City. In 1987, Sunderland <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> of the lowest points in their history, when they were relegated to the Third Division of the English league for the first time. Under new chairman Bob Murray and new manager Denis Smith, the club was promoted the following season. In 1990, they were promoted {{back to the top}} flight in unusual circumstances. Sunderland lost to Swindon Town in the play-off final, but Swindon's promotion was revoked after the club was found guilty of financial irregularities and Sunderland were promoted instead.

He was given a one-race ban and a €50,000 fine for his role in the collision, forcing him to miss the Italian Grand Prix. He was replaced by the team's testing and reserve driver, Jérôme d'Ambrosio. Grosjean returned to the team for the next round in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Taft {{was opposed}} to the {{traditional}} practice of rewarding wealthy supporters with key ambassadorial posts, preferring that diplomats not live in a lavish lifestyle and selecting men who, as Taft put it, would recognize an American when they <b>saw</b> <b>one.</b> High on his list for dismissal was the ambassador to France, Henry White, whom Taft knew and disliked from his visits to Europe. White's ousting caused other career State Department employees to fear that their jobs might be lost to politics. Taft also wanted to replace the Roosevelt-appointed ambassador in London, Whitelaw Reid, but Reid, owner of the New-York Tribune, had backed Taft during the campaign, and both William and Nellie Taft enjoyed his gossipy reports. Reid remained in place until his 1912 death.|$|E
