Furthermore, the yield curve <b>spread’s</b> <b>ability</b> to estimate is compared to that of share prices, using the JSE All Share Index.

In addition to these models, this research also makes {{use of the}} business cycle conditionally independent probit model for estimation. The findings suggest that share prices improve the yield curve <b>spread’s</b> <b>ability</b> to forecast recessions when estimating using the static probit model; however when comparing the results between the financial variables, the yield curve spread continues to produce the best forecast of recessions in South Africa.

40|$|As an {{important}} type of dynamics on complex networks, spreading {{is widely used}} to model many real processes such as the epidemic contagion and information propagation. One {{of the most significant}} research questions in spreading is to rank the <b>spreading</b> <b>ability</b> of nodes in the network. To this end, substantial effort has been made and a variety of effective methods have been proposed. These methods usually define the <b>spreading</b> <b>ability</b> of a node as the number of finally infected nodes given that the spreading is initialized from the node. However, in many real cases such as advertising and medicine science the spreading only aims to cover a specific group of nodes. Therefore, it is necessary to study the <b>spreading</b> <b>ability</b> of nodes towards localized targets in complex networks. In this paper, we propose a reversed local path algorithm for this problem. Simulation results show that our method outperforms the existing methods in identifying the influential nodes with respect to these localized targets.

One study has reported neutral effects of common milkweed on the native flora of sand dune grasslands in Hungary after {{the removal of}} invasive pine plantation. However, the effects of common milkweed on native flora more generally are unknown. Focusing on the potential effect ofmilkweed, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) the cover of native grassland species decreases with increasing cover of common milkweed; and (2) native species with low specific leaf area (SLA), height, seed mass and clonal <b>spreading</b> <b>ability</b> (i. e. low competitive ability) are more likely suppressed by milkweed compared with natives with high competitive ability. Location: Late successional sandy old-fields invaded by milkweed in the Great Hungarian Plain (Kiskunsáag, central Hungary). Methods: We recorded the cover of vascular plants in seven old-fields; in each old-field we sampled 12 plots including plots with different milkweed cover and control plots without milkweed. We used linear mixed effect models for exploring the effects of milkweed on the species richness and cover of native grassland species. To identify the common traits of the most affected native species, we used trait-based analyses; we studied leaf–height–seed traits and clonal <b>spreading</b> <b>ability.</b> Results: We detected no effect of common milkweed on total species richness, {{but it had a}} negative effect on the cover of grassland species. The negative effect of common milkweed was most pronounced on the cover of species with low SLA, low seedmass and low clonal <b>spreading</b> <b>ability.</b> Conclusions: Our results suggest that native, late successional sandy grasslands invaded by common milkweed form undesirable novel ecosystems because of significant negative impacts on the cover of native grassland species, especially those species with low competitive ability. For these species, management of milkweed might be needed to ensure their persistence in sandy grasslands in this landscape...|$|E
