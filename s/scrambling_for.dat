5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offensive}} line was particularly concerned with containing Florida State sophomore defensive end Brandon Jenkins, who was {{tied for third}} {{in the nation in}} sacks (12) and 15th in tackles for loss (18.5). On {{the other half of the}} defensive line, defensive end Markus White recorded seven sacks during the regular season. In total, Florida State's defense was No.1 in college football in terms of sacks (43) and 15th in tackles for loss (7.2 per game). Florida State placed a priority on containing Tyrod Taylor and preventing him from <b>scrambling</b> <b>for</b> extra yardage. The Seminoles were 39th nationally in total defense, allowing an average of 341 yards per game.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} their mutual dislike, the Electress and Violante Beatrice {{attempted}} to improve Gian Gastone's poor public image together. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died; it was a rarity {{for the public to}} see him. To dispel the said rumours, the Electress compelled him to make an appearance—his last one—in 1729, on the feast day of the patron saint of Florence, John the Baptist. The Ruspanti, Gian Gastone's morally corrupt entourage, hated the Electress; and she, them. Violante Beatrice tried to withdraw the Grand Duke from their sphere of influence by organising banquets. His conduct at these literally sent those in attendance <b>scrambling</b> <b>for</b> their carriages: he vomited repeatedly into his napkin, belched and told rude jokes. These distractions ceased upon Violante Beatrice's death in 1731.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{was stopped}} {{on their first}} drive due to an {{unsuccessful}} fourth down conversion. Baylor's first possession ended when UT's Michael Huff intercepted a pass from Baylor's Terrance Park. Longhorn Jamaal Charles scored a touchdown on the drive but the kick was blocked, giving Texas the only first-quarter score and a 6–0 lead. Texas extended {{the lead in the}} secondquarter with rushing touchdowns from Henry Melton, Jamaal Charles, and Ramonce Taylor. Taylor made two more touchdowns in the thirdquarter and Quan Cosby caught a touchdown pass from Young. In the fourth quarter, Taylor scored his fourthtouchdown and backup quarterback Matt Nordgren scored on an odd play where he was hit and fumbled while <b>scrambling</b> <b>for</b> the goal line but the ball traveled forward at about the same speed he was running and bounced right back up into his hands. Texas won the 2005game 62–0 making it the only shutout of the 2005season for the Longhorns.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} at its 20-yard line needing to score quickly {{in order to}} have a chance at making up the 10-point deficit, which would require two {{separate}} scores to make good. Mike Cox completed a seven-yard pass, then Maurice Williams broke free for a 15-yard rush that gave Tech a first down and drove the Hokies to the 42-yard line. Cox completed a long pass into the Air Force red zone, but the completion was negated by an offensive pass interference penalty against Tech that cost the Hokies the long completion, a loss of down, and an additional 15yards. While <b>scrambling</b> <b>for</b> extra time in which to throw the ball, Cox was sacked by Air Force defender Chris Funk and fumbled the ball. Air Force recovered the loose football, and the Falcons' offense returned to the field with just over four minutes left to play.|$|E
5|$|The Tigers' third {{possession}} didn't produce {{anything more}} than their first two possessions did. A running play was stopped for no gain, Dantzler was sacked for a loss of three yards by David Pugh, and a scramble by Dantzler gained only four yards. Clemson's punt was downed at the Tech 41-yard line, and the Hokies had another chance on offense. On the first play of the drive, Vick scrambled for a nine-yard gain. On the next play, Tech gained a first down on a run by backup running back Andre Kendrick to the Clemson 46-yard line. After an incomplete pass, Vick completed a six-yard toss to Kendrick. A five-yard offsides penalty gave Tech a first down at the Clemson 35-yard line, then Vick completed a six-yard throw to wide receiver Emmett Johnson. This was followed by Vick <b>scrambling</b> <b>for</b> a first down at the Clemson 19-yard line. A reverse run by Johnson picked up five yards, then a run up the middle gained a first down at the Clemson nine-yard line. Two rushes by Kendrick failed to reach the five-yard line, then Vick ran six yards for Tech's second touchdown of the game. The extra point was good, and Tech extended its lead to 140 with 1:08 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
25|$|While <b>scrambling</b> <b>for</b> personnel, Pershing reorganized the {{replacement}} system, {{and tried to}} improve its responsiveness to the flexible army corps and army organizations. Pershing ordered the 40th and 85th Divisions to serve as regional replacement depots for the First and Second Armies, respectively, and the 41st and 83rd as depot divisions in the Services of Supply. Eventually, the 39th and 76th Divisions were stripped of their personnel. The replacement system remained unsatisfactory {{to the end of}} the war.|$|E

However, Tatham had roots in Oklahoma (his father had moved to California during the Great Depression), and felt that putting his team there would {{give something back to}} the state. He christened his team the Oklahoma Outlaws. The club was the second major-league sports team to play in the state, after the North American Soccer League's Tulsa Roughnecks, and played at Skelly Stadium.|$|E

But while <b>scrambling</b> <b>for</b> a first down, Young lost a fumble without being touched and linebacker Monte Coleman recovered it. This led to a 71-yard drive finished off by Lohmiller's 32-yard field goal, cutting Washington's deficit to 17-6. On the next series, the ball again slipped out of Young's hands, this time on a pass attempt, and Redskins lineman Charles Mann recovered it on the San Francisco 15-yard line. Three plays later, Rypien scored on a 1-yard sneak, cutting the deficit to 17-13 {{early in the fourth}} quarter.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to get a}} 2nd {{straight}} win {{and stay}} alive for the playoffs, the Chargers went to Kansas City for a divisional road game vs. the Chiefs.

The Chargers started to rally as RB LaDainian Tomlinson getting a 6-yard TD run, while QB Phillip Rivers completed a 4-yard TD to Malcom Floyd (with a failed 2-pt conversion) with 1:19 left in the game. The 'Bolts recovered the onside kick and Rivers threw a 10-yard TD to WR Vincent Jackson with 40 seconds left (with another failed 2-pt try). to take a 22–21 lead.

Grossman only saw playing time during the later portion of the season after the Bears had been eliminated from playoff contention. His season ended when he was forced to leave the final game with a broken finger. Prior to the start of the 2004 NFL season, the Bears fired Jauron and hired Lovie Smith, who declared Grossman the team's starting quarterback. Grossman was criticized when he threw a game-ending interception against the Detroit Lions on opening day. Criticism of his durability intensified when he damaged his knee ligaments while <b>scrambling</b> <b>for</b> a touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings. The injury forced Grossman to spend the remainder of the season recuperating.|$|E

2500|$|Hitler's Four Year Plan {{called for}} a modernized {{expanded}} agricultural sector to free Germany from the fear of a blockade, a network of motorways, remodeled cities, a massive program of import-substitution to supply synthetic strategic material and military industries capable of out-producing the largest enemy economy. The plan required a rigid structure of six main economic divisions: raw materials production, raw materials distribution, labor agriculture, price control and foreign exchange. It made heavy demands on resources already in short supply because of high military spending, resulting in the delay or postponement of most programs while <b>scrambling</b> <b>for</b> raw materials, building workers and engineering equipment. [...] Pseudo markets were created to attempt {{to make the system}} work more efficiently. In response to blat-like commerce arising, Germany passed laws labeling such unsanctioned commerce as [...] "economic sabotage" [...] punishable by death.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors regarding public opinion about illegal immigration is the level of unemployment; anti-illegal immigrant sentiment is highest where unemployment is highest and vice versa.
