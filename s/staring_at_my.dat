500|$|One {{formality}} left were New York's late-in-the-season primary {{elections on}} September 12, {{which in this}} case merely served to ratify the state party conventions' choices. [...] Lazio won unopposed, while Clinton won 82percent of the vote in easily defeating unknown Manhattan doctor Mark McMahon, who ran on the grounds that [...] "the Clintons have tried to hijack the Democratic Party." [...] For her part, Clinton said that she was [...] "surprised, in a way [...] I stood there for a minute, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> name." [...] In any case, the general election was already well underway.|$|E
500|$|According to Emily Jupp of The Independent, despite various {{changes in}} musical direction, an [...] "unconventional fashion sense" [...] {{has been a}} {{constant}} in Diamandis's career. In the video to [...] "How to be a Heartbreaker," [...] she [...] "subverts the norm" [...] by wearing more clothes than male models in the background; she reflected that [...] "I don’t think it suits me to wear very little clothing, it just wouldn’t feel right. I’d rather people listen to what I have to say instead of <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> bum." [...] In 2011, when promoting The Family Jewels, Diamandis [...] described her fashion styles as [...] "vintage, cheerleader, and cartoon." [...] Four years later, she described her costumes then as [...] "very badly put together vintage, kind of glittery ensemble", and her outfits for Froot as a [...] "mix of '70s with digital fiberware...something surreal and '70s." ...|$|E
500|$|Photos of Parks and Recreation {{producers}} {{were included}} among {{the photos of}} past city council members on the town hall walls. The photo of Norm Hiscock is the one Leslie said she believes, [...] "No matter what direction I move, he's always <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> chest. Mark's social networking site featured in [...] "Boys' Club" [...] included the character {{with a wide range}} of promiscuous women. The pictures were shot during a photo session during which, according to series co-creator Michael Schur, [...] "We brought in a lot of women and basically said, you're really trashy. You're trashy women, and we're going to take your picture now." [...] During the courtyard party scenes, a brief clip shows Poehler, Jones and Schneider dancing together. The clip was actually the three actors out-of-character playing around between takes, but the Parks producers decided to add it to the episode.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{he commented}} {{on his new}} feat, {{but it was also}} a {{reminder}} to me, a trifle cruel, that he was not my boy. After all, you see, Mary had not given him the whole of his laugh. The watch said that five and twenty minutes had passed, and looking out I saw Irene at one end of the street <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>my</b> window, and <b>at</b> the other end Mary's husband <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>my</b> window, and beneath me Mary <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>my</b> window. They had all broken their promise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not stare--ho, ho,--not stare--that {{is a good}} one," [...] {{replied the}} other with a satiric laugh and sneer--"Who's to prevent me from <b>staring,</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>my</b> friends, if I like? not you, old highlows." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{crushed the}} letter in my hand, and sat <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> it, <b>my</b> pigsty in ruins about my ears, {{face to face with}} the fact that, even in a best of all {{possible}} worlds, money will not buy everything.|$|R
2500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with People, Selleck talked about {{living and working}} on his farm: [...] "So I like to get outside {{and work on the}} farm, from fixing roads to clearing brush. I hate going to the gym, so sweating outdoors sure beats sitting on a stationary bike <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> navel. And I work cheaper than anyone I could hire to do it." [...] Selleck has also stated he dislikes avocados.|$|E
2500|$|The character's first return storyline {{concentrated}} on her attempt to seduce and then blackmail wealthy resident Ian Beale (played by Adam Woodyatt). [...] "Clare's a chancer," [...] explains Bissix, [...] "She sees Ian as a route to easy money!" [...] The Sun newspaper reported that [...] "Ian is mesmerised" [...] by Clare's attempts to lure {{him away from}} his wife Jane (Laurie Brett). Commenting on the storyline, Bissix said [...] "Clare knows Ian is married! But that makes it more of a challenge." [...] Eventually Clare's true motive was unearthed. After Ian nearly relented to her attempts at seduction, she proceeded to blackmail him. An EastEnders insider said: [...] "Ian has been completely blown away by Clare ever since {{she returned to the}} Square. She is a saucy little minx and will stop at nothing to get him into bed. But she’s not really interested in him – she just wants his money. So Ian is really playing with fire and risking his marriage just by being alone with Clare. But he’s more of a silly old fool than anything – although I’m not sure that Jane will see it like that, especially if she finds out about their kiss. And Clare being Clare, she probably will – unless of course Ian pays her to keep quiet." [...] However, in the storyline, Clare's games were eventually halted when Ian confessed to Jane and she ordered Clare to [...] "Stay away from Ian!". According to Bissix, filming these scenes was particularly hard for Adam Woodyatt, who knew her well when she was only a child from her first stint in the soap: [...] "Poor Adam. He spent a day <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> chest for one scene, trying to get the fact that the last time he saw me I was 14 out of his head. He was a friend of Nigel so he was around all the time when I was first here and we'd done scenes together. Now, instead of this snotty-nosed little girl making Nigel's tea, she was trying to seduce him and get him in his Y-fronts." ...|$|E
60|$|He turned, laughing, to Mademoiselle. But {{she stood}} with her lips parted and her hands dropped, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> companion. Then she took two steps forward and stopped with a cry.|$|E
60|$|I felt {{a visible}} {{swelling}} {{to the proper}} dimensions of a Royal Highness as I sat down by the king's right hand. The nobles resumed their places, the bronze-skinned waitresses left off standing like soldiers {{in a row and}} <b>staring</b> straight <b>at</b> <b>my</b> humble self, the goblets went round once more, and a comely maid soon brought me meat, bread, fruits, and date wine.|$|R
60|$|The man slunk off. I {{find it very}} {{difficult}} to describe how I was affected by the discovery that Rosanna Spearman was missing. I seemed to be in fifty different minds about it, all at the same time. In that state, I stood <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Sergeant Cuff--and <b>my</b> powers of language quite failed me.|$|R
60|$|As {{the first}} {{shock of the}} change of light passed, I saw about me more distinctly. The little sloth-like {{creature}} was standing and <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> me. <b>My</b> conductor had vanished. The place was a narrow passage between high walls of lava, {{a crack in the}} knotted rock, and on either side interwoven heaps of sea-mat, palm-fans, and reeds leaning against the rock formed rough and impenetrably dark dens. The winding way up the ravine between these was scarcely three yards wide, and was disfigured by lumps of decaying fruit-pulp and other refuse, which accounted for the disagreeable stench of the place.|$|R
6000|$|He laughed, {{and turning}} to the two soldiers, who also were <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> mail and sword, bade them go. When the heavy door had shut behind them and we were quite alone, he said: ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a little}} while this {{realization}} stunned my mind. My thoughts came to a pause, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> discovery. Meanwhile my feet and my previous direction carried me through the warm darkness to Checkshill station with its little lights, to the ticket-office window, and so to the train.|$|E
60|$|Did what I could.... I cowered, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> knuckles, and {{it seemed}} that a little {{concourse}} of strangers, heads close together, were talking in my mind. My eyes were dry; I think the spectre of a smile had dragged up my lips. Mrs Bowater raised herself in her bed, and peered over at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "To-night! If I {{give myself}} till to-night, {{something}} else may happen. If I give myself till to-night, I may hesitate again. I'm {{weary of the}} torture of hesitating. I must and will have relief in the present, cost what it may in the future. My letter to Midwinter will drive me mad if I see it <b>staring</b> and <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> me in <b>my</b> desk any longer. I can post it in ten minutes' time--and I will! ...|$|R
60|$|He was, at any rate, {{up to his}} time, {{for when}} I came down on the {{following}} morning I found him in the narrow street, the first on horseback. Joseph, the Frenchman, was strapping on to a rough pony our belongings, and was <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Smith. <b>My</b> new friend, unfortunately, could not speak a word of French, and therefore I had {{to explain to the}} dragoman how it had come to pass that our party was to be enlarged.|$|R
6000|$|They {{had seen}} the man named [...] "Jack" [...] leave {{the woman at the}} gate of an {{apparently}} respectable villa residence not far from the Regent's Park. Left to himself, he took a turning to the right, which led to a sort of suburban street, principally inhabited by shopkeepers. He stopped at the private door of one of the houses, and let himself in with his own key--looking about him as he opened the door, and <b>staring</b> suspiciously <b>at</b> <b>my</b> men as they lounged along {{on the opposite side of}} the way. These were all the particulars which the subordinates had to communicate. I kept them in my room to attend on me, if needful, and mounted to my peep-hole to have a look at Mr. Jay.|$|R
60|$|As I have said, {{there was}} a broad {{corridor}} there, which ran outside three empty bedrooms. At {{one end of the}} corridor we were all marshalled by Sherlock Holmes, the constables grinning and Lestrade <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> friend with amazement, expectation, and derision chasing each other across his features. Holmes stood before us with the air of a conjurer who is performing a trick.|$|E
6000|$|... "I!" [...] I exclaimed, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own {{reflection}} {{in a silver}} plate which made me look--well, more unattractive than usual. [...] "It's {{very kind of you}} to say so, but I can't understand why I should. You have seen very little of me, Lady Ragnall, except in that long journey across the desert when we did not talk much, since you were otherwise engaged." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have looked}} for hard on half an hour, Cousin Rosamund; also at {{your back and}} at Godwin's left arm and side-face, till in truth I thought myself {{kneeling}} in Stangate Priory <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> father's effigy upon his tomb, while Prior John pattered the Mass. Why, if you stood it on its feet, it is Godwin, the same crossed hands resting on the sword, the same cold, silent face staring at the sky." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{turned away}} on my heel and fell moodily to contemplating the {{mountain}} of luggage. A huge packing-case attracted my attention, and I was <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> it when she spoke <b>at</b> <b>my</b> shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "At last it was {{the sense}} of her that roused me from my mood. I turned upon her {{suddenly}} and challenged her to race down the mountain slopes. 'No,' she said, as if I had jarred with her gravity, but I was resolved to end that gravity, and make her run--no one can be very gray and sad who is out of breath--and when she stumbled I ran with my hand beneath her arm. We ran down past a couple of men, who turned back <b>staring</b> in astonishment <b>at</b> <b>my</b> behaviour--they must have recognised my face. And half way down the slope came a tumult in the air, clang-clank, clang-clank, and we stopped, and presently over the hill-crest those war things came flying one behind the other." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I stood <b>at</b> <b>my</b> window <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> an arcing streetlight.A sudden wind made me pull my {{shoulders}} to my ears.I pissed into the dark.It smelled like canned tuna.My swollen lip throbbed.I could still taste the blood.My eyes rolled back looking for memories.I stopped.|$|R
60|$|I lay {{after that}} wide awake, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> memories. In some odd way these visions {{mixed up with}} my dream of in my uncle in his despair. The black body which saw now damaged and partly buried, but which, nevertheless, I no longer felt was dead but acutely alive and perceiving, I mixed up with the ochreous slash under my uncle's face. I tried to dismiss this horrible {{obsession}} from my mind, but it prevailed over all my efforts.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Janet claimed Julian's attention, {{and left}} Horace free {{to return to}} Mercy. [...] "Your room is ready for you," [...] she said. [...] "You will stay here, of course?" [...] Julian {{accepted}} the invitation---still with {{the air of a}} man whose mind was preoccupied. Instead of looking at his aunt when he made his reply, he looked round at Mercy with a troubled curiosity in his face, very strange to see. Lady Janet tapped him impatiently on the shoulder. [...] "I expect people to look at me when people speak to me," [...] she said. [...] "What are you <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> adopted daughter for?" ...|$|E
60|$|The pictures, also, {{seemed to}} attract his attention, for {{he spent much}} time skating over the glasses and {{studying}} the designs. Sometimes I would find him <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> Madonna, as if he said, 'What {{in the world are}} all those topsy-turvy children about?' Then he'd sit {{in the middle of a}} brook, in a water-color sketch by Vautin, as if bathing his feet, or seem to be eating the cherry which one little duck politely offers another little duck, in Oscar Pletch's Summer Party. He frequently kissed my mother's portrait, and sat on my father's bald head, as if trying to get out some of the wisdom stored up there, like honey in an ill-thatched bee-hive. My bronze Mercury rather puzzled him, for he could not understand why the young gentleman didn't fly off when he had four wings and seemed in such a hurry.|$|E
40|$|My {{return to}} the {{typewriter}} began with a feverish compulsion to acquire not just one but a handful, beginning with the machines I used in college—a Hermes 3000 and a Royal desktop. But I didn 2 ̆ 7 t stop there. I became obsessed with earlier typewriters, especially those with glass keys, and purchased a 1940 s-era Smith Corona Sterling portable and a Royal Arrow. The touch of a fingertip on that Sterling 2 ̆ 7 s black keys gave me a sensual thrill. A few weeks later, a West German Olympia SM 3 portable arrived from an eBay seller, and I left it on my desk—to write on, I thought—but I spent far more time simply <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> it, running <b>my</b> hand over its graceful metal curves, tracing the chrome trim with my finger, and admiring the green wrinkle paint. My wife, observing all of this, suggested I mention this typewriter business to my therapist. She wasn 2 ̆ 7 t joking...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, my friend,' he said, {{seeing me}} <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> his belt, 'you are looking <b>at</b> <b>my</b> [...] "carver". I {{thought it might}} come in handy if we came to close quarters; it is {{excellent}} steel, and many is the pig I have killed with it.' ...|$|R
60|$|But I, {{cradled in}} woodcraft, had heard plainly a man {{creeping}} through the underbrush beside us. Fear of the Congo chief and pity for the wretch tore <b>at</b> <b>my</b> heart. Suddenly there loomed {{in front of}} us, on the path, a great, naked man. We stood with useless limbs, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
60|$|N.B.--Perhaps it was Oliver Twist or The Old Curiosity Shop--I am {{not certain}} {{which was the}} current {{excitement}} just then; but I am quite sure it was Mrs. Nickleby who first disclosed to us that our guest had a splendid pair of dark eyes. Hitherto he had kept them averted in the studious manner I have often noticed in persons who {{did not wish to}} excite suspicion of <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> peculiarities; but that lady's feelings when her neighbour's legs came down her chimney were too much for his self-consciousness, and he gave a glance that disclosed dark liquid depths, sparkling with mirth. He was one number in advance of us, and could enlighten us on the next stage in the coming story; and this went far to reconcile us to the invasion, and to restore him to the proper use of his legs and arms--and very shapely limbs they were, for he was a slim, well-made fellow, with a dark gipsy complexion, and intelligent, honest face, altogether better than we expected.|$|E
60|$|But {{the thought}} of these starers stuck in my mind, and {{presently}} I came out again. The sun was now up, {{but it was still}} behind the cape of woods. Say {{a quarter of an hour}} had come and gone. The crowd was greatly increased, the far bank of the river was lined for quite a way--perhaps thirty grown folk, and of children twice as many, some standing, some squatted on the ground, and all <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> house. I have seen a house in the South Sea village thus surrounded, but then a trader was thrashing his wife inside, and she singing out. Here was nothing: the stove was alight, the smoke going up in a Christian manner; all was shipshape and Bristol fashion. To be sure, there was a stranger come, but they had a chance to see that stranger yesterday, and took it quiet enough. What ailed them now? I leaned my arms on the rail and stared back. Devil a wink they had in them! Now and then I could see the children chatter, but they spoke so low not even the hum of their speaking came my length. The rest were like graven images: they stared at me, dumb and sorrowful, with their bright eyes; and it came upon me things would look not much different if I were on the platform of the gallows, and these good folk had come to see me hanged.|$|E
60|$|We {{had come}} to see blackguards; but these men were {{something}} worse. There is a comic side, more or less appreciable, in all blackguardism--here there was nothing but tragedy--mute, weird tragedy. The quiet in the room was horrible. The thin, haggard, long-haired young man, whose sunken eyes fiercely watched the turning up of the cards, never spoke; the flabby, fat-faced, pimply player, who pricked his piece of pasteboard perseveringly, to register how often black won, and how often red--never spoke; the dirty, wrinkled old man, with the vulture eyes and the darned great-coat, who had lost his last sou, and still looked on desperately, after he could play no longer--never spoke. Even the voice of the croupier sounded as if it were strangely dulled and thickened in the atmosphere of the room. I had entered the place to laugh, but the spectacle before me was something to weep over. I soon found it necessary to take refuge in excitement from the depression of spirits which was fast stealing on me. Unfortunately I sought the nearest excitement, by going to the table and beginning to play. Still more unfortunately, as the event will show, I won--won prodigiously; won incredibly; won at such a rate that the regular players at the table crowded round me; and <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> stakes with hungry, superstitious eyes, whispered to one another that the English stranger was going to break the bank.|$|E
60|$|He was <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the {{tablecloth}} and the stain {{of the wine}} that he had spilled when first Mademoiselle de Lavedan's name was mentioned. His head had been bent so that his long black hair had tumbled forward and partly veiled his face. <b>At</b> <b>my</b> question he suddenly looked up. The ghost of a smile hung on his sensuous lips, for all that excitement had paled his countenance beyond its habit.|$|R
60|$|Phil elevates his one eyebrow, {{and after}} respectfully <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> his master to express interest, {{swallows}} a great gulp of coffee, still <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
50|$|One of Haley's photos where Claire is <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Gloria's {{cleavage}} is a re-shoot of Delmar Watson's famous {{photograph of}} Sophia Loren <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Jayne Mansfield's cleavage.|$|R
