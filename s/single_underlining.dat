40|$|Convergence of multisensory {{information}} {{can improve the}} likelihood of detecting and responding to an event {{as well as more}} accurately identifying and localizing it. The ubiquitous nature of crossmodal processing is observed in everything from basic signal detection to speech recognition. Although we observe multisensory integration throughout various modalities, this dissertation reviews and discusses research focusing primarily on the relationship between the auditory-linguistic system and visual systems. A series of experiments and simulations presented here show graded effects of crossmodal processing that are reflected in reaction time data and motor output, measured through streaming x-y coordinates from eye-movements. A model simulates and makes predictions about real-time crossmodal processing that argue against the traditional serial and parallel approach to visual attention and supports a perspective with a <b>single</b> <b>underlining</b> mechanism. A purely parallel process is introduced as a means for reconciling both traditional and continuous accounts of visual attention. A broad philosophical discussion follows, in which an integrative and continuous approach to crossmodal processing is proposed and discussed...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} 20 years, social capital, has been evoked in several field {{of social science}} {{research}} and used to explain a vast range of phenomena: political participation, institution performance, corruption, economic success of countries and so on. Unfortunately, dealing with social capital at a scientific level presents, at least, three main problems. First social capital’s definition is still elusive, especially due to its multi-dimensional nature. Second, it is a particular form of capital related to {{a very high level}} of intangibility. Finally, because of lack of suitable data there is neither a universal measurement method, nor a <b>single</b> <b>underlined</b> indicator commonly accepted by the literature. These are some of the reasons for which social capital measures are considered as proxies. By using the density of workers within industrial districts, we have constructed an alternative proxy to those that already exist in the literature in order to empirically analyse the difference, in terms of economic performance, across the Italian regions. The methodology we have applied to derive the index is identical to that one used to construct the Putnam’s instrument. Empirical evidence shows that our measure does not affect macroeconomic indicators such as investment and income per capita. However, it significantly influences unemployment disparities, and the level of innovation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Allgrove {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autosomal recessive disorder characterised by childhood onset, alacrima, oesophageal achalasia, adrenocortical insufficiency, neurological and occasionally autonomic involvement. Although the disease {{has been associated with}} mutations in the ALADIN gene on chromosome 12 q 13, it is genetically heterogeneous. The case we report is interesting because of its onset in adulthood, long duration of disease and prominent neurological dysfunctions. After the onset of neurological abnormalities the diagnosis went unrecognised for years until the patient presented for evaluation of dysphagia. The presence of achalasia with dysphagia, adrenal insufficiency, reduced tear production, optic atrophy and peripheral motor-sensory neuropathy with axonal loss led us to clinically diagnose Allgrove syndrome even though a genetic study showed no mutations in the ALADIN gene exons. The case we report shares many clinical features with Allgrove syndrome and, even with the limitations of a <b>single</b> case, <b>underlines</b> the variability in this syndrome and the need for appropriate investigations along with a multidisciplinary approach...|$|R

The microbial communities induced by run-off water, a black crust covering {{a portion of the}} shelter, and a cryptoendolithic microbial community, were studied. Molecular analyses based both on DNA and RNA were performed to identify the major components of these microbial communities present and metabolically active, respectively, at the studied location. While similar microbial communities were expected due to the proximity of the studied sites, clearly different communities were detected suggesting that specific microorganisms adapt to different micro-environments. Phototrophic microorganisms represented the major portion of total RNA and DNA in the studied microbial communities. Run-off water induced the presence of a large proportion of putative photosynthetic bacteria belonging to Chloroflexi. Different groups of bacteria were associated to phototrophs and were represented by Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gammaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes.

40|$|AbstractMitochondrial tRNA point {{mutations}} {{are important}} causes of human disease, {{and have been}} associated with a diverse range of clinical phenotypes. Definitively proving the pathogenicity of any given mt-tRNA mutation requires combined molecular, genetic and functional studies. Subsequent evaluation of the mutation using a pathogenicity scoring system is often very helpful in concluding whether or not the mutation is causing disease. Despite several independent reports linking the m. 3291 T>C mutation to disease in humans, albeit in association with several different phenotypes, its pathogenicity remains controversial. A lack of conclusive functional evidence and an over-emphasis on the poor evolutionary conservation of the affected nucleotide have contributed to this controversy. Here we describe an adult patient who presented with deafness and lipomas and evidence of mitochondrial abnormalities in his muscle biopsy, who harbours the m. 3291 T>C mutation, providing conclusive evidence of pathogenicity through analysis of mutation segregation with cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency in <b>single</b> muscle fibres, <b>underlining</b> the importance of performing functional studies when assessing pathogenicity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{multidisciplinary}} approach {{was used to}} analyse the role of pioneer trees(Populus nigra) on bar formation in the modern fluvial system of the RiverLoire (France). Data were collected on seven plots located on a secondarychannel, chosen for their vegetation cover and their sedimentary context. Physical features of vegetation, topographical evolution, sediment grain sizeand flow velocity were investigated during and after floods between 2001 and 2003. Woody vegetation responds morphologically to fast-flowing waters andsediment deposition. These adaptations influence {{the role played by}} trees onlocal sedimentary processes. Some morphological types of trees exert a stronginfluence during flood events by deflecting, reducing or increasing the flowenergy. As a consequence, the evolution of bedforms, distribution of sedimentgrain size and slopes are controlled by the flood type, the morphologicalcontext (i. e. high- or low-energy zones), the morphology of the vegetated barand the characteristics of vegetation. Conceptual models are proposed toaccount for local processes and evolution of tree groves. The first model, whichdescribes the behaviour of groves during a <b>single</b> flood, <b>underlines</b> thesediment deposition downstream of the trees and the trapping of bedloadsediments. During the falling stage of the flood, the reorientation of currentstreams, constrained by both local bed topography and woody vegetation,induces transverse sediment fluxes. For these water levels, the control exertedby trees on small-scale sedimentary processes becomes significant. The secondmodel shows the evolution of vegetation bands over several flood events. Inparticular, it describes the influence of vegetation on the fixing and reworkingof bedload sediments during the falling limb of the hydrograph. Thecoalescence of vegetation-induced bedforms and the resulting morphologicalchanges increase the deflection power of the vegetated bar, inducing thedeposition of finer sediments...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground: The {{classification}} of HIV- 1 strains in subtypes and Circulating Recombinant Forms (CRFs) has helped in tracking {{the course of}} the HIV pandemic. In Senegal, which is located at the tip of West Africa, CRF 02 _AG predominates in the general population and Female Sex Workers (FSWs). In contrast, 40 % of Men having Sex with Men (MSM) in Senegal are infected with subtype C. In this study we analyzed the geographical origins and introduction dates of HIV- 1 C in Senegal in order to better understand the evolutionary history of this subtype, which predominates today in the MSM population Methodology/Principal Findings: We used a combination of phylogenetic analyses and a Bayesian coalescent-based approach, to study the phylogenetic relationships in pol of 56 subtype C isolates from Senegal with 3025 subtype C strains that were sampled worldwide. Our analysis shows a significantly well supported cluster which contains all subtype C strains that circulate among MSM in Senegal. The MSM cluster and other strains from Senegal are widely dispersed among the different subclusters of African HIV- 1 C strains, suggesting multiple introductions of subtype C in Senegal from many different southern and east African countries. More detailed analyses show that HIV- 1 C strains from MSM, are more closely related to those from southern Africa. The estimated date of the MRCA of subtype C in the MSM population in Senegal is estimated to be in the early 80 's. Conclusions/Significance: Our evolutionary reconstructions suggest that multiple subtype C viruses with a common ancestor originating in the early 1970 s entered Senegal. There was only one efficient spread in the MSM population, which most likely resulted from a <b>single</b> introduction, <b>underlining</b> the importance of high risk behavior in spread of viruses...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution X-ray {{spectra of}} O-type stars {{revealed}} less wind absorption than expected from smooth winds with conventional mass-loss rates. Various solutions have been proposed, including porous winds, optically thick clumps or an overall {{reduction of the}} mass-loss rates. The latter has a strong impact {{on the evolution of}} the star. Our final goal is to analyse high resolution X-ray spectra of O-type stars with a multi temperature plasma model in order to determine crucial wind parameters such as the mass loss rate, the CNO abundances and the X-ray temperature plasma distribution in the wind. In this context we are developing a modelling tool to calculate synthetic X-ray spectra. We present, here, the main ingredients and physics necessary for a such work. Our code uses the AtomDB emissivities to compute the intrinsic emissivity of the hot plasma as well as the CMFGEN model atmosphere code to evaluate the opacity of the cool wind. Following the comparison between two formalisms of stellar wind fragmentation, we introduce, {{for the first time in}} X-rays, the effects of a tenuous inter-clump medium. We then explore the quantitative impact of different model parameters on the X-ray spectra such as the position in the wind of the X-ray emitting plasma. For the first time, we show that the two formalisms of stellar wind fragmentation yield different results, although the differences for individual lines are small and can probably not be tested with the current generation of X-ray telescopes. As an illustration of our method, we compare various synthetic line profiles to the observed O VIII λ 18. 97 Å line in the spectrum of ζ Puppis. We illustrate how different combinations of parameters can actually lead to the same morphology of a <b>single</b> line, <b>underlining</b> the need to analyse the whole spectrum in a consistent way when attempting to constrain the parameters of the wind.

Pure H 2 O and CO 2 inclusions are subordinate. Using the terminology of Thomas et al. (2000) the melt inclusions can be classified as (i) water-poor type-A and (ii) water-rich type-B inclusions. Generally the primary trapped melt droplets have crystallized to several different mineral phases plus a vapor bubble. However, type-B melt inclusions which are not crystallized also occur, and at room temperature they contain four different phases: a silicate glass, a water-rich solution, and liquid and gaseous CO 2. The primary fluid inclusions represent an aqueous CO 2 -rich supercritical fluid which contained elemental sulfur. Such fluids are extremely corrosive and reactive and were supersaturated with respect to Ta and Zn. From the phase compositions and relations we can show that the primary mineral-forming, volatile-rich melt had an extreme low density and viscosity and that melt-melt-fluid immiscibility was characteristic during the crystallization of beryl.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a nationally representative sample of youth health centers. A total of 2, 250 young women and 920 young men aged 15 - 23 completed a self-administered questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95 % CI were calculated. Results: A consistent and strong association was noted between exposure to all types of violence during the past year and victimization before the age of 15 for all types of violence for both women and men. The only exceptions were childhood sexual victimization and sexual violence during the past year for men. Younger age was associated with all violence exposure for the women and with emotional violence for the men.

40|$|The {{main subject}} of this thesis {{is the art of}} Swedish artist Randi Fisher (1920 - 1997). She was educated at Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm and mainly worked as a painter in many techniques. Textile art and public art cought her interest, and, from 1960 and onwards, stained glass painting. Even though the strong focus on one <b>single</b> artist may <b>underline</b> a biographical theme, the aim is to shed light on her contemporaries as well - the most {{well-known}} beeing Olle Bonniér, Lage Lindell, Pierre Olofsson, Karl Axel Pehrson and Lennart Rodhe. These artists are, in Swedish art history, usually referred to as "The Men of 1947 " (the year of their break-through). Their female counterpart, Randi Fisher (part-taker in the famous first exhibition "Ung konst" in 1947), is seldom mentioned. Using a method suggested by British art historians Griselda Pollock and Rozsika Parker, the aim is (on the one hand) to present new facts about an earlier "unknown" female artist and her art and, (on the other hand) to critically discuss and deconstruct art history itself, its discourses, categories, values, its implicit or explicit ideologies, hierarchies and canonizing processes. By applying French cultural sociologist Pierre Bourdieu's theories and methods in combination with gender theory, it is possible to fruitfully examine Randi Fisher's position in the Swedish art field. Thus not only her art, but also her place in the art field and role as an artist becomes an important point of departure in the analysis. In Bourdieu's words, both her cultural, social and economic capital were high and resulted in a strong position: success as a painter, a lot of exhibitions, public commissions. Both Nationalmuseum, and later Moderna Museet in Stockholm bought her works. The sociological perspective is also underlined in an examination of art critics' statements about Fisher's art in newspapers during the 1940 s and 1950 s respectively. In order to offer a wide perspective on Fisher's art, both early self-portraits and later abstract and nonfigurative paintings and designs for book-covers, as well as textiles and stained glass paintings are presented and analyzed. Another important trope is her strong engagement in spiritual, political and ideological quesions, and in what ways these subjects also came to influence Randi Fisher's art...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{research}} on ensembles of classifiers tends to demonstrate that Stacking learning scheme (Wolpert (1992), Ting and Witten (1999), Seewald (2002)) can perform comparably to the best of the base classifiers as selected by cross-validation, if not better. It is to be hoped that we can expect that the final classifier produced by Stacking is able to achieve better performances in terms of accuracy than the best level- 0 classifier. Otherwise the computational onus created by the complexity of the procedure would not be justified. This has motivated us to investigate empirically the performance of the Stacking technique, also in terms of stability and robustness, solving the problem of the combination of supervised classified methods by using two different approaches: one may be defined as traditional and the other as innovative. To this end, together with the approach that we will define as traditional, and that is inserted into the framework of StackingC (Seewald (2002)), and uses the combination of different base classification methods that are constructed and evaluated via cross-validation, an extension of the Forward Search (Atkinson, Riani and Cerioli, (2004); (2010)) is proposed, so as to have a robust approach to the same problem. Forward Search is a methodological proposal which, apart from allowing anomalous values to be identified, also makes it possible to monitor in an iterative way the effect exerted by each unit on the model and on the quantities of interest in each step of the search. The “ philosophy” {{at the heart of the}} Forward Search approach is the creation of a dynamic data analysis process, compared to that of a “static” type, supplied by the traditional approach The research trend described has established the following objectives for this work:  Evaluation of the base-level and meta-level classifiers in terms of their accuracy when there are modifications in the size of the data set and in the number of times the experiment is repeated.  Evaluation of the effects caused by the presence of anomalous values in the data set on the performances of the base-level and meta-level classifiers and their comparison using two different approaches: - Traditional (Cross Validation) - Innovative (Forward Search)  Evaluation of the results of the simulation studies carried out to establish whether, and to what extent, the combination of classifiers makes it possible to improve performances compared to the use of a <b>single</b> classifier.  <b>Underlining</b> the influence that single observations may have on each classifier’s rule of decision.  Monitoring the stability of the allocation rule with regard to the different sample sizes. On what we might define as the traditional level, a Stacking scheme is proposed that has some differences compared to the well-known one, both in terms of characteristics that are already present and with regard to the introduction of innovative elements. Therefore, the innovative nature of the proposal is to be found chiefly in the extension of the Forward Search in the approach to the combination of supervised classification methods, which is Stacking scheme, in order to build the whole procedure in a robust way. In both approaches the phases of the building of the Stacking scheme are illustrated and the main empirical results obtained are shown...|$|R
