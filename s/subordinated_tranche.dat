This {{econophysics}} work {{studies the}} long-range Ising {{model of a}} finite system with N spins and the exchange interaction J N and the external field H {{as a model for}} homogeneous credit portfolio of assets with default probability Pd and default correlation ρd. Based on the discussion on the (J, H) phase diagram, we develop a perturbative calculation method for the model and obtain explicit expressions for Pd, ρd and the normalization factor Z in terms of the model parameters N and J, H. The effect of the default correlation ρd on the probabilities P(Nd, ρd) for Nd defaults and on the cumulative distribution function D(i, ρd) are discussed. The latter means the average loss rate of the“tranche ” (layered structure) of the securities (e. g. CDO), which are synthesized from a pool of many assets. We show that the expected loss rate of the <b>subordinated</b> <b>tranche</b> decreases with ρd and that of the senior tranche increases linearly, which are important in their pricing and ratings...|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Citibank {{introduced}} a new structure for credit card-backed securities, called an issuance trust, which does not have limitations that master trusts sometimes do, that requires each issued series of securities to have both a senior and <b>subordinate</b> <b>tranche.</b> [...] There are other benefits to an issuance trust: they provide more flexibility in issuing senior/subordinate securities, can increase demand because pension funds are eligible to invest in investment-grade securities issued by them, and they can significantly {{reduce the cost of}} issuing securities. [...] Because of these issues, issuance trusts are now the dominant structure used by major issuers of credit card-backed securities.|$|R
