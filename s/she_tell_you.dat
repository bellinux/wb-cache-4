"Did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that the}} poor {{stranger}} was young and pretty-faced, with black moustarches? that his store clothes must have cost a fortin, saying nothing of his gold-lined, broadcloth sarrapper? Did she say that his horse was so lame that when I went to get another he wouldn't WAIT for it? Did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> WHO he was?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{you stop}} here, like good childer, Aunt Dinah is agoing out. If you keep quiet <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> story {{when she comes}} in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be cursing, I tell you, girl. And {{what is it}} your misthress is {{wishing to}} do now? Did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> to come to me?" ...|$|E
60|$|So {{you look}} up the number in the book again, and at last <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> {{that you are in}} connection; and then, ramming the trumpet tight against your ear, you stand waiting.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} affection {{you have always}} entertained for Iris. <b>She</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what <b>she</b> pleases about the past. If <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> nothing about her late husband, think the worst and {{you will not be}} wrong. Remember that {{whatever}} she has done was done for me and at my instigation. She ought to have married you instead of me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wot!" [...] screams Mrs. Prince, {{jumping up}} and waving her arms about. [...] "Wot! Go your own way; I’ll have nothing {{more to do with}} you. And don’t blame me for {{anything}} that happens. It’s a very bad thing to come to a witch for advice and then not to do as <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you.</b> You ought to know that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I {{fell out}} of the machine?" [...] cried Dick. [...] "There is some mistake here. I have had no fall. When did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Once more Mrs. Meldrum genially glared. [...] "Did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{how much}} the Hammond Synges have kindly left her to live on? Not quite eighty pounds a year." ...|$|E
6000|$|He had {{his eyes}} only on Vanderbank. [...] "Well, my losses are my own affair." [...] Then his face came back. [...] "Did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I didn't like her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, that I did! <b>She</b> wouldn't <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> There'll be many a {{thing in}} life <b>she</b> won't <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> I went to let her hear from my lips what I thought {{of her as a}} wife for you. I told her what I thought of a woman who plays the part of a wanton--" ...|$|R
60|$|Gerv. Yes, Mr Woodall, {{for want}} of a better, as <b>she</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, if---if {{you take}} pains,' said Mysie; 'but you mustn't bother her with {{questions}} {{in the middle of}} a lesson, or <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> not to chatter. She likes to have them all kept for the end; and then, if they aren't foolish, she will take lots of trouble.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about me?" [...] asked Mollie, {{changing}} cows. Murray {{discovered that}} she was tall and that the big blue print apron shrouded a singularly graceful figure.|$|E
6000|$|Once more my hostess genially {{glared at}} me. [...] "Did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{how much the}} Hammond Synges have kindly left her to live on? Not quite eighty pounds a year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{since you}} speak of him---- I hadn't meant to, unless you did. I want {{to be fair to}} him. What did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about him?" [...] Jeff asked confidentially.|$|E
60|$|COMTESSE. You are {{wondering}} whether <b>she</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> who gives him his second thoughts.|$|R
5000|$|Essie Mae is dead. <b>She</b> can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{her side}} of the story. The {{defendant}} won't.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a {{fool the}} man is!" [...] said Madame Zamenoy. [...] "He {{comes to us}} {{for what he calls}} his {{property}} because he wants to marry the girl, and she is deceiving him all the while. Go to Nina Balatka, Trendellsohn, and <b>she</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> who has the document. <b>She</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> where it is, if it suits her to do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, my dear friend; {{and perhaps}} I shall {{ask you to}} help me out of mine before I have done. But never mind that now. What did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about the adventure?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} to find that out, you must get it through Florence. You may be quite sure I shall tell her; and I suppose I may be quite sure she will tell you. Does <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> everything?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Cecilia {{shook her}} head. [...] "Thinking, Francine, {{of the new}} life before her--and regretting, I am afraid, that she ever confided her hopes and wishes to me. Did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> last night what her {{prospects}} are when she leaves school?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do what I told you," [...] said Mrs. Lecount. [...] "Ask {{the maid}} that {{question}} about her mistress on the spot. And if <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> the mark is there, {{do one thing}} more. Take me up into your wife's room, and open her wardrobe in my presence with your own hands." ...|$|R
40|$|This column {{includes}} a short case presentation and differ-ential diagnosis. It {{is followed by}} a discussion of the disease or condition and how the school nurse should handle it. History R. Q. is a 13 -year-old who has been waiting in your of®ce. She stopped earlier in the day and asked if she could talk to <b>you.</b> <b>She</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> that <b>she</b> is embarrassed to talk about her problem. You notice that she has her hands closed and hidden in her clothes. <b>You</b> wait while <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> that her hands are ugly, and no one will hold or touch her hands. You ask R. Q. to show you her hands. She has many large dome-shaped, grey-brown hyperkeratotic growths on her ®ngers, around and under her nails, and {{on the back of her}} hands.

6000|$|... "I told you," [...] said Allan, simply, [...] "when I thought I {{was sweet}} on her myself. Come! come! it's a little hard, I think, {{even if you}} are in love with her, to believe {{everything}} <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you,</b> and not to let me say a word. Is that the way you decide between us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will go {{with you}} certainly, if you wish it," [...] Paul answered, not too cordially, for he did not wish his brother {{to know that it}} was what he had already planned to do. [...] "Did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that we had already a slight acquaintance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Perfectly furious, {{you poor}} old fellow!--the rage of a {{disappointed}} pigeon! I wouldn't {{be in your}} shoes for anything. Oh my! I wish Amy was here. Did--did--Agnes"--(he struggles with his laughter, and explodes {{from time to time}} between syllables)--"did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how the woman looked?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now tell me," [...] said Mrs. M'Leod--"that tall one, I saw {{out of the}} scullery window--did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> she {{was always}} here in the spirit? I hate her. She made all this trouble. It was not her house after she had sold it. What do you think?" ...|$|E
5000|$|.....We got the bubble-headed bleached-blonde, {{comes on}} at five; <b>she</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> 'bout {{the plane crash}} with a gleam in her eye...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Send for the Wicked Witch. <b>She</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> in {{a moment}} whether that wooden-legged person is a common man or a magician." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Recovering himself, with a smile.] Has <b>she</b> been <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> my {{numerous}} faults? [To JENNY.] You {{must have}} had plenty to talk about, my love.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother Anastasia is very sensible," [...] said I, [...] "and if I were to see her, I {{should be}} happy to express my {{appreciation}} of her good advice upon the subject. And, by the way, did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that it was necessary}} to wear that hot bonnet while you are working?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, didn't <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{about this}} new plan of ours? Well, we have tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task and worked at it with a will. The {{vacation}} is nearly over, the stints are all done, and we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know--I know," [...] {{cried the}} Count, with a troubled look, {{as he passed}} his hand across his brow. [...] "I might have {{expected}} it. She cannot sustain the misery I have brought on her. Oh! why was I prevented from freeing her from such a father. Is she very ill? Did she send for me? Did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what I am?" ...|$|E
60|$|If {{she wants}} to see much of her brother she let him choose rather an unfortunate profession.... I wonder <b>she</b> didn't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the truth.|$|R
