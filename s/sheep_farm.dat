30|$|There {{is only a}} near {{critical}} {{population of}} Jakar sheep in the country, and declining at rapid rate. <b>Sheep</b> <b>farming</b> has lost its importance due to no further need to produce clothing from the herd; minimal or no income; and other challenges dissuading <b>sheep</b> <b>farming.</b> Depredation by wildlife, skin diseases, feed shortages and labour shortages continue to impede <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> and has led to reduction in flock size or farmers giving up <b>sheep</b> <b>farming.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{and described}} the farmers' attitudes towards <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> in three districts of Tamil Nadu state in India, namely, Coimbatore, Dindigul and Tiruchirappalli. It examined the farmers' personal characteristics, determined their overall attitude towards <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> and how this attitude varied based on their personal characteristics. One hundred and fifty farmers formed the sample. The study revealed that majority of the farmers were middle aged, illiterate, had 5 - 15 {{years of experience in}} <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> and had a sheep flock size of 50 – 100. A majority of the respondents were found to have a favourable attitude towards <b>sheep</b> <b>farming.</b> Education was found to have a negative and significant association with attitude. In comparison, the farmers of Tiruchirappalli district were found to have a less favourable attitude towards <b>sheep</b> <b>farming.</b> Introducing basic scientific concepts in <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> is advised to enhance productivity in the state of Tamil Nadu...|$|R

25|$|Farming, and in {{particular}} <b>sheep</b> <b>farming,</b> has been the major industry in the region since Roman times.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to determine that <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> in the villages to increase farmers welfare could be developed taken into consideration of farmers perception and attitude which were included in the planning of development programme. In order to achieve the objective more effectively, the institutional system of <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> needs to be transformed into a corporate institution. Field study was conducted during the period of 1994 - 1997 in two villages of Jambu sub district, District of Semarang. Two approaches were used simultaneously, i. e. ideografis and nomotetis to analyze the data and information. Result s showed that, first, <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> in the villages still had big development opportunity. second, the threat of stagnation in the <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> may occur due to high dependency on family labor and lack of capital. Third, due to top down policy and lack of vision on the agrobusiness activities, the development of <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> could be hampered. Fourth, transforming into a corporate institution may increase economic profitability of <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> as well as performance of the farms. Fifth, in order to realize the development of corporate business systems, need to establish a pilot project. To implement the concept, support from banking institution especially for discount rate was necessary, along with the involvement of ATAI (Agricultural Technology Assessment Institutes), local livestock services, credit system and local government leader that has people oriented vision. ...|$|R

It was founded by Cathcart Wason in the mid-1870s and named by him after his old home Barrhill in South Ayrshire, Scotland. Wason set it up as a model village for the workers of his large <b>sheep</b> <b>farm.</b> The population of the village peaked in the mid-1880s before the general recession initiated a downturn for the village. Wason had expected for the Methven Branch railway to run past Barrhill, but the line was built in 1880 on an alignment many miles away, which caused Barrhill population to decrease.|$|E
