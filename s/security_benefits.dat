25|$|In 2004, Urban Institute economists C. Eugene Steuerle and Adam Carasso {{created a}} Web-based Social <b>Security</b> <b>benefits</b> {{calculator}}.

Using this calculator it is possible to estimate net Social <b>Security</b> <b>benefits</b> (i.e., estimated lifetime benefits minus estimated lifetime FICA taxes paid) for different types of recipients. In the book Democrats and Republicans – Rhetoric and Reality Joseph Fried used the calculator to create graphical depictions of the estimated net benefits {{of men and women who}} were at different wage levels, single and married (with stay-at-home spouses), and retiring in different years. These graphs vividly show that generalizations about Social <b>Security</b> <b>benefits</b> may be of little predictive value for any given worker, due to the wide disparity of net benefits for people at different income levels and in different demographic groups. For example, the graph below (Figure 168) shows the impact of wage level and retirement date on a male worker. As income goes up, net benefits get smaller – even negative.|$|E

25|$|According to {{a report}} by the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee, the gender pay gap jeopardizes women's {{retirement}} security. Of the multiple sources of income Americans rely on later in life, many are directly linked to a worker's earnings over his or her career. These include Social <b>Security</b> <b>benefits,</b> based on lifetime earnings, and defined benefit pension distributions that are typically calculated using a formula based on a worker's tenure and salary during peak-earnings years. The persistent gender pay gap leaves women with less income from these sources than men. For example, older women's Social <b>Security</b> <b>benefits</b> are 71% of older men's benefits ($11,057 for women versus $15,557 for men in 2009). Incomes from public and private pensions based on women's own work were just 60% and 48% of men's pension incomes, respectively.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the phenomenon “digital self-service” and “the social <b>security</b> <b>benefit</b> recipients, who are not yet ready to participate in the labour market”. People in Denmark are offered digital self-service everywhere in the public sector, but these services are not equally available to everyone. This thesis is based on a case study of the social <b>security</b> <b>benefit</b> recipients’ access and the potential use of digital self-service in the municipality of Copenhagen. The case study is based on a multiple mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, which are crucial to answer the research question: Why is digital self-service not offered for the group of social <b>security</b> <b>benefit</b> recipients, who are not yet ready to participate in the labour market, and what consequences would equal digital op-portunities in the employment sector have for this group of social <b>security</b> <b>benefit</b> recipi-ents? The analysis is divided into two parts, based on the two theoretical traditions we are focusing on in this master thesis. This divide is based on the two questions in the overall research question. The first part of the analysis will examine the overall primary data, from a political and economic perspective, where New Public Management and the Principal-agent theory are used as parts of the explanation in relation to the public management rationales describing the unequal access to digital self-service. The thesis also examines how New Public Man-agement as a ruling paradigm in the public sector has affected the policy area. The second part of the analysis is based on another theoretical tradition according to the examined phenomenon. The individual is the primary focus of this analysis. Therefore, a more sociological approach is applied. The theories of Digital Divide and Empowerment are added to examine the consequences of equal digital opportunities for this group of so-cial <b>security</b> <b>benefit</b> recipients. The two parts of the analysis raises questions, which require a discussion of the usage of the phenomenon mentioned above. Can digital self-service be seen as a public management tool or is it more a self-empowering mechanism that sets the individual free? Based on the overall analysis and discussion this master thesis concludes, that lack of public management tools – especially using sanctions – is causing the unequal digital opportunities. In addition, equal digital opportunities cause a major risk of excluding the social <b>security</b> <b>benefit</b> recipi-ents – who are not yet ready to participate the labour market – from participating in society on the same terms as everyone else...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{growth in}} wage {{inequality}} {{has important implications}} for Social Security solvency and the distribution of benefits. Because only earnings below the taxable maximum are subject to Social Security payroll taxes, wage growth that is concentrated among very high earners will generate lower tax receipts than wage growth that is more evenly distributed. The progressivity of the Social <b>Security</b> <b>benefit</b> formula increases benefit payouts when the share of workers with low wages grows. This study uses a dynamic microsimulation model to examine the aggregate and distributional consequences of alternative scenarios about the distribution of future wage growth among workers. We find fairly marked changes in projected Social <b>Security</b> <b>benefit</b> distributions, poverty, and long-term financing status with relatively modest changes in assumptions about wage differentials. ...|$|R
