5|$|Even {{though this}} episode aired {{as the last}} episode of the first season, {{it was the first}} episode in {{production}} and was intended to be the first episode to air from the half-hour show. The series is a spin-off from The Tracey Ullman <b>Show</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the family already appeared in a series of animated one-minute shorts. The characters were already created, but had to be further developed in order to carry a half-hour show. The episode was therefore meant as an introduction to the characters. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and writer/producer Sam Simon (of such television series as Cheers) wrote the script for the episode. Both Groening and Simon are credited with developing the series along with executive producer James L. Brooks. The name of Ms. Botz was based on a real person that once babysat Groening.|$|E

5|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} {{who was the first}} choice for the role of the itinerant prostitute, Suzy.

Andrews's role, as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady, would launch her to stardom. Another candidate was Janet Leigh, whom Rodgers admired greatly, but the actress proved to be unavailable. The producers settled on Judy Tyler, auditioned after Rodgers spotted her on television while watching The Howdy Doody <b>Show,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> she appeared as Princess Summerfall Winterspring.|$|E
