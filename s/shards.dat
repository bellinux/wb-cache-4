5|$|In {{addition}} to fueling Hero actions, Bezels {{act as a}} safeguard to character defeat. Characters will not receive any direct damage {{as long as there}} is at least one Bezel. If there are enough Bezels remaining, receiving damage that would otherwise defeat the character instead causes the character to be knocked into the air and the Bezel is shattered into <b>shards</b> that scatter across the battlefield. If the player does not have any Bezels remaining, the characters go into critical mode. Critical mode causes the characters to become extremely scared, leaving them unable to shoot quickly, unable to use Hero actions, and taking direct damage from every attack. Four Bezel <b>Shards</b> must be collected by the characters in order to restore a Bezel and replenish their power, and enemies can even pick up Bezel <b>Shards</b> to regenerate health and shields. The game ends if any character is killed and there are no intact Bezels to protect them.|$|E
5|$|Previously, {{cards were}} also sold in Tournament Packs {{typically}} containing three rares, ten uncommons, thirty-two commons, and thirty basic lands. Tournament Packs were discontinued after <b>Shards</b> of Alara.|$|E

50|$|CUBRID {{provides}} {{built-in support}} for database <b>sharding.</b> The <b>sharding</b> interface is implemented {{by a special}} broker called CUBRID <b>SHARD.</b> Communicating with CUBRID <b>SHARD</b> is identical to communicating with a normal broker so the same client APIs can be used. All features of the normal broker such as failover and load balancing also apply to CUBRID <b>SHARD.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{database}} <b>shard</b> is {{a horizontal}} partition of {{data in a}} database or search engine. Each individual partition {{is referred to as}} a <b>shard</b> or database <b>shard.</b> Each <b>shard</b> is held on a separate database server instance, to spread load.|$|R

5|$|The {{density of}} {{individual}} particles varies with different eruptions. The density of volcanic ash varies between 700–1200kg/m3 for pumice, 2350–2450kg/m3 for glass <b>shards,</b> 2700–3300kg/m3 for crystals, and 2600–3200kg/m3 for lithic particles. Since coarser and denser particles are deposited close to source, fine glass and pumice <b>shards</b> are relatively enriched in ash fall deposits at distal locations. The high density and hardness (~5 on the Mohs Hardness Scale) {{together with a}} high degree of angularity, make some types of volcanic ash (particularly those with a high silica content) very abrasive.|$|E

5|$|Tails and Amy {{infiltrate}} G.U.N.'s {{island base}} and rescue Sonic, while Eggman, Shadow and Rouge collect three Emeralds on the island. Eggman makes a global broadcast threatening to fire on Earth in 24 hours if his demands are not met, demonstrating the cannon's power by destroying half the Moon. Sonic, Tails, Amy and Knuckles use their Chaos Emerald {{to track down}} the other six. They infiltrate Eggman's base, boarding his shuttle as it launches into space. Knuckles' Master Emerald <b>shards</b> are spilled along the way, and he leaves to collect them. He again fights Rouge, but when he saves her from falling into a lava pit, she gives him her <b>shards</b> and he restores the Master Emerald.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial War Museum North {{was opened}} in Trafford, Greater Manchester in 2002. It {{was the first}} branch of the museum outside {{southeast}} England, {{and the first to}} be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, Imperial War Museum North was his first building in Britain. Libeskind’s building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays, was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into <b>shards</b> and reassembled. These <b>shards,</b> representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape. Originally budgeted at £40 million, the museum was eventually completed for £28.5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by private donations and by Peel Holdings, a local transport and property company which contributed £12.5 million.|$|E

His classmate Parzival mocks him, that he is as useless as his father. Despite Allomere's presence they start a fight.

5|$|The {{main flow}} {{of the game is}} {{different}} from the other Dragon Quest games; instead of exploring one large world, the party goes to separate continents by placing stone <b>shards</b> into their appropriate pedestals in Estard Fane. Once all of the missing <b>shards</b> are located and placed for a particular pedestal, the party is transported to the trapped location in the past. After solving whatever problems plague the location, the party then travels back to Estard, the beginning island. From there, they can travel via boat, carpet, or skystone to the modern version of the location they just saved. These saved lands appear on the main map, although the originals (from the past) can be revisited through the ruins.|$|E
5|$|Greenland ice cores show {{evidence}} of a large volcanic eruption in 1642±5BCE, which was suggested as being associated with Santorini. However, volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core does not match the expected Santorini fingerprint.

He stops them by shattering the emerald and searches for the scattered <b>shards.</b> Rouge, spying for the government, heads to Eggman's base and the ARK. There, Shadow shows Eggman the Eclipse Cannon, another superweapon created by Gerald, and discloses his plan: to charge the cannon with Chaos Emeralds {{and use it to}} take over the world. Rouge appears, offering them a Chaos Emerald to gain their trust.|$|E

5000|$|In practice, <b>sharding</b> is complex. Although it {{has been}} done {{for a long time}} by hand-coding (especially where rows have an obvious grouping, as per the example above), this is often inflexible. There is a desire to support <b>sharding</b> automatically, both in terms of adding code support for it, and for {{identifying}} candidates to be <b>sharded</b> separately. Consistent hashing is a technique used in <b>sharding</b> to spread large loads across multiple smaller services and servers.|$|R

5|$|Pottery <b>shards</b> {{found at}} the {{important}} site of Jarlshof also indicate that there was Neolithic activity there although the main settlement dates from the Bronze Age. This includes a smithy, a cluster of wheelhouses and a later broch. The site has provided evidence of habitation during various phases right up until Viking times. Heel-shaped cairns, are a style of chambered cairn unique to Shetland, with a particularly large example on Vementry.|$|E
5|$|Roman remains, {{possibly}} a signal station or watchtower, {{have been identified}} on the island by an electrical resistance survey. Accurate exploration and interpretation of the site is difficult as it was reused by builders in both the Victorian era and during World War II.

In addition to <b>shards</b> of cooking pots from the Roman era, some luxury items have been identified including Arretine ware, La Tène style brooches, and an amphora dating from between 90 and 140AD which was made in southern Spain. There have also been <b>shards</b> of Castor ware. Fragments of pottery roofing and box flue tiles have been identified signifying the presence of a heating system and {{possibly a}} bath house. Roman coins from the reigns of Claudius Gothicus (268–270) and Tetricus I (271–273) have also been found.|$|E
