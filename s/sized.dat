50|$|<b>Size</b> zero or <b>size</b> 0 is a women's {{clothing}} <b>size</b> in the US catalog <b>sizes</b> system. <b>Size</b> 0 and 00 {{were invented}} {{due to the}} changing of clothing <b>sizes</b> over time (referred to as vanity <b>sizing</b> or <b>size</b> inflation), which has caused the adoption of lower numbers. For example, a 2011 <b>size</b> 0 is equivalent to a 2001 <b>size</b> 2, and is larger than a 1970 <b>size</b> 6 or 1958 <b>size</b> 8. Modern <b>size</b> 0 clothing, depending on brand and style, fits measurements of chest-stomach-hips from 30-22-32 inches (76-56-81 cm) to 33-25-35 inches (84-64-89 cm). <b>Size</b> 00 can be anywhere from 0.5 to 2 inches (1 to 5 cm) smaller than <b>size</b> 0. <b>Size</b> zero often refers to extremely thin individuals (especially women and adolescent girls), or trends associated with them.|$|R

Life-history theory predicts that increased environmental stress {{results in a}} shift in reproductive allocation from offspring quantity to quality and a stronger trade-off between egg <b>size</b> and clutch <b>size.</b> To test this prediction, we investigated patterns of variation in life-history traits (i. e. age, body <b>size,</b> clutch <b>size</b> and egg <b>size)</b> among four populations of Bufo andrewsi from Baoxing County, western China, at different altitudes. We found that body <b>size,</b> age, egg <b>size</b> and total reproductive output, but not clutch <b>size,</b> differed between populations. Clutch <b>size</b> and total reproductive output increased with female <b>size</b> and age. However, egg <b>size</b> decreased with female <b>size</b> and did not change with female age. The egg <b>size</b> and clutch <b>size</b> trade-off was evident for all populations except at lowest altitude, {{and the strength of}} trade-off between egg <b>size</b> and clutch <b>size</b> increased with altitude.

30|$|Four rosin derivatives, {{including}} {{rosin esters}} and rosinamides, were synthesized {{and used to}} prepare neutral rosin <b>sizes.</b> Their effects during <b>sizing</b> are discussed in detail. Compared to natural rosin, the rosin derivatives had nearly no effect on <b>sizing</b> even at high retention levels in paper. However, the rosin derivatives in the rosin <b>sizes</b> improved {{the stability of the}} emulsion <b>size</b> particles, and there was good correlation between the <b>sizing</b> effect and the stability of the emulsion <b>sizes</b> under neutral to alkaline conditions. On the other hand, the structure of the rosin derivatives significantly influenced the stability and <b>sizing</b> effect of the neutral rosin <b>sizes.</b> In particular, for glycerin rosin ester-rosin <b>sizes,</b> the emulsion stability and <b>sizing</b> effect increased with an increasing proportion of dirosinate, among the glycerin rosin esters. Consequently, it was suggested that the rosin derivatives hardly contribute to the <b>sizing</b> performance of paper but predominantly function to stabilize the neutral rosin <b>size</b> particles, thereby improving the efficiency of the <b>size</b> under neutral to alkaline <b>sizing</b> conditions. Also it was supposed that glycerol dirosinate in the neutral rosin <b>size</b> would probably enable formation of a more stable particle structure to prevent the destructive action of the OH− ion.|$|R
