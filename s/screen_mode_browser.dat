50|$|The Agora World Wide Web email browser {{was based}} on the Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser.</b> The Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> was very popular in the {{beginning}} of the web, since it was the only web browser available for all operating systems. Statistics from January 1994 show that Mosaic had quickly changed the web browser landscape and only 2% of all World Wide Web users browsed by Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser.</b> The new niche of text-only web browser was filled by Lynx, which made the Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> largely irrelevant as a browser. One reason was that Lynx is much more flexible than the Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser.</b> It then became a test application for the libwww.|$|R

50|$|In 1991 {{after the}} release of WorldWideWeb, Nicola Pellow {{developed}} the first cross-platform web <b>browser,</b> Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser,</b> which is credited for making the internet accessible to consumers for the first time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplicity}} of the Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> had several limitations.The Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> was designed to work on any operating system using what were called [...] "dumb" [...] terminals. The user interface had to {{be as simple as}} possible. The user began with a command-line interface specifying a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The requested web page was then printed line by line on the screen, like a teleprinter. Websites were displayed using the first versions of HTML. Formatting was achieved with capitalization, indentation, and new lines. Header elements were capitalized, centered and separated from the normal text by empty lines.|$|R
50|$|The Agora server {{is based}} on the Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> and on the libwww and thus it {{supported}} different kinds of internet protocols besides the classical http and gopher browsing, namely NNTP, Archie, Finger, WAIS.|$|R
50|$|The first stable version, 1.1, was {{released}} in January 1992. Since version 1.2l, released in October 1992, the browser has used the common code library (later called libwww). The main developer, Pellow, started working on the MacWWW project, and both browsers began to share some source code. In the May 1993 World Wide Web Newsletter Berners-Lee announced that the browser {{was released}} into the public domain to reduce the work on new clients. On 21 March 1995, {{with the release of}} version 3.0, CERN put the full responsibility for maintaining the Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> on the W3C. The Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> and the libwww library are closely tied together—the last independent release of a separate browser component was in 1995, and the browser became part of libwww.|$|R

From 1995 onwards, the Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> was no longer released separately, but part of the libwww package.|$|R
50|$|Many other {{computer}} programs are also capable of processing or creating plain text, such as countless programs in DOS, Windows, classic Mac OS, and Unix and its kin; {{as well as}} web browsers (a few browsers such as Lynx and the Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> produce only plain text for display) and other e-text readers.|$|R
50|$|This game also {{features}} 2-player split <b>screen</b> <b>mode</b> or a Link Cable.|$|R
50|$|Other {{features}} included rlogin and telnet hyperlinks, Cyrillic support (added at 25 November 1994 in version 2.15), {{and ability}} {{to be set up}} as a proxy client. The browser could run as a background process and download files. The Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> has had problems recognizing character entities, properly collapsing whitespace, and supporting tables and frames.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was written}} at CERN by Robert Cailliau and later Nicola Pellow {{helped with the}} development. Pellow worked {{original}} on the Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> and both browsers shared {{some parts of the}} source code after her switching.Pre-alpha version were available, but this version worked only on [...] "coliur sic mac but not on big black and white ones it seems." ...|$|R

50|$|By {{the end of}} 1992 other browsers had appeared, many of them {{based on}} the libwww library. These {{included}} Unix browsers such as Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser,</b> ViolaWWW, Erwise, and MidasWWW, and MacWWW/Samba for the Mac. Even though these browsers tended to be simple HTML viewers, relying on external helper applications to view multimedia content, they provided choice to users both in browsers and platforms.|$|R
50|$|The Line <b>Mode</b> <b>Browser</b> was {{designed}} {{to be able to be}} platform independent. There are official ports to Apollo/Domain, IBM RS6000, DECStation/ultrix, VAX/VMS, VAX/Ultrix, MS-DOS, Unix, Windows, Classic Mac OS, Linux, MVS, VM/CMS, FreeBSD, Solaris, and to macOS. The browser supports many protocols like File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Gopher, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), and Wide area information server (WAIS).|$|R

50|$|Several {{third-party}} Spectrum clones, {{including the}} Timex Sinclair machines and the Pentagon, support a <b>screen</b> <b>mode</b> in which attribute blocks are 8×1 pixels in size {{rather than the}} usual 8×8. A <b>screen</b> in this <b>mode</b> takes 12 KB RAM. In {{the case of the}} Timex, this mode is activated through the command OUT 255,2. In addition, this <b>screen</b> <b>mode</b> can be generated through the use of the MB-02 disk system's DMA hardware (where the technique is known as Multitech), and is also available as Mode 2 on the SAM Coupé.|$|R

However, holding the Option key (⌥) while clicking the zoom button or double-clicking on the window chrome continues to invoke the original behavior.|$|R
5000|$|BBC BASIC {{contained}} aliases for {{the commonly}} used VDU codes (such as GCOL for VDU 18 or PLOT for VDU 25). Some statements were direct equivalents to VDU codes, such as CLS for VDU 12. Some statements were less exact equivalents as they incorporated functionality specific to BASIC {{as well as}} calling the OS routines; for example the statement [...] would set <b>screen</b> <b>mode</b> [...] and adjust the BASIC system variable HIMEM according {{to the amount of}} memory the new mode left available for BASIC, while [...] would set the <b>screen</b> <b>mode</b> only, without altering HIMEM. This allowed a programmer to allocate a block of memory from BASIC for example to load machine code routines into by lowering the value of HIMEM {{at the start of a}} program, and still be free to switch <b>screen</b> <b>modes</b> without deallocating it as a side effect.|$|R
