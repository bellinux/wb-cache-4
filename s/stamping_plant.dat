5|$|At the New York–Pennsylvania {{border in}} Ripley, PA5 becomes NY5 upon {{entering}} New York. It very closely follows {{the shore of}} Lake Erie through all of Chautauqua County. Once reaching the village of Silver Creek it briefly overlaps US20 until entering Erie County at the Cattaraugus Reservation and NY438 where the roads once again split. Once in Erie County it pulls slightly inward from the lake shore from Brant to the hamlet of Wanakah. Once past Wanakah, the road once again closely borders the lake shore and goes through steadily more heavily developed areas, particularly the Ford <b>Stamping</b> <b>Plant</b> and the Bethlehem Steel plant {{in the city of}} Lackawanna where the road is called the Hamburg Turnpike and eight wind powered turbines, which pump power into the national grid are visible. Near the northern edge of the city, NY5 begins to ascend onto an elevated roadway as it connects to Ridge Road and the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens by way of an interchange. Here, the route becomes the Buffalo Skyway, a limited-access highway with exits for Ohio and Tifft streets and Fuhrmann Boulevard. After a quarter-mile, NY5 passes seamlessly into the city of Buffalo.|$|E

In 1978 Volkswagen of America purchased the plant. to supply stampings for its Westmoreland Assembly Plant, subsequently selling the plant when it closed Westmoreland in 1988 to Park Corporation of Cleveland, OH.

40|$|This paper reviews {{contemporary}} {{developments in}} team work design theory and identifies two distinctive team work design concepts currently in use - {{those of the}} autonomous work team and the empowered work team. The paper establishes the critical team work design criteria {{to be applied to}} each concept, with autonomous designs focussing upon the development of team self-organization, the development of team member skills {{and the development of a}} collective voice in setting goals and targets, and empowered designs focussing upon the expansion of the team member work role and the enhancement of team responsibility for business results. The paper goes on to show how these criteria are applied in practice, by presenting comparative case studies of team work in two automotive body <b>stamping</b> <b>plants</b> in the Australian vehicle industry. The research underlines the value of looking at teams from a work design perspective. By developing this perspective, team work design concepts can clearly distinguished and the outcomes of teamworking for employees can be clearly identified. Employees in autonomous teams exercise some control over the allocation of job assignments, have some collective say in the setting of production goals and targets and they have greater opportunities for skill development. Employees in empowered teams, in comparison, exercise less autonomy but have expanded work roles and are far more accountable for business results. Empowered team work designs would seem to offer employees limited gains compared to those available from autonomous designs...|$|R
40|$|Variation in the {{incoming}} sheet material and {{fluctuations in the}} press setup is unavoidable in many <b>stamping</b> <b>plants.</b> The effect of these variations can have a large influence {{on the quality of}} the final stamping, in particular, unpredictable springback of the sheet when the tooling is removed. While stochastic simulation techniques have been developed to simulate this problem, there has been little research that connects the influence of the noise sources to springback. This paper characterises the effect of material and process variation on the robustness of springback for a semi-cylindrical channel forming operation, which shares a similar cross-section profile as many automotive structural components. The study was conducted using the specialised sheet metal forming package AutoForm TM Sigma, for which a series of stochastic simulations were performed with each of the noise sources incrementally introduced. The effective stress and effective strain scatter in a critical location of the part was examined and a response window, which indicates the respective process robustness, was defined. The incremental introduction of the noise sources allows the change in size of the stressstrain response window to be tracked. The results showed that changes to process variation parameters, such as BHP and friction coefficient, directly affect the strain component of the stressstrain response window by altering the magnitude of external work applied to forming system. Material variation, on the other hand, directly affected the stress component of the response window. A relationship between the effective stressstrain response window and the variation in springback was also established...|$|R
