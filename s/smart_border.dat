40|$|The European Commission {{suggested}} in 2008 that the EU border management {{should take a}} step forward to combat organised crime and illegal immigration. In 2013 the European Commission published its legislative proposal on the European <b>Smart</b> <b>Borders</b> package for automated border controls. The legislative proposal included three regulations: (1) a proposal to establish the Entry/Exit System that would automatically alert the authorities if a visa holder has exceed his/her stay; (2) a proposal for the Registered Travelled Programme that would enable speedy border proceedings for frequent third country passengers; and (3) a regulation to amend the Schengen Borders Code to make {{it compatible with the}} proposals. The European Commission proposal received a lot of critic and it was said to be in conflict with fundamental rights, especially with the data protection right. In 2016 the Commission published its new proposal for the EU <b>Smart</b> <b>Borders</b> package. The legislative process is on-going as the European Parliament and the Council have agreed to start the negations. The research evaluates the need for border management changes as well as the possible fundamental right protection issues that may arise as the European Commission proposal, for example, includes processing and storing biometrical data of third country nationals. The topic is approached by looking into the current and past situation of EU border management as well as its connection with the fundamental rights protection. A conclusion for the research is that the EU <b>Smart</b> <b>Borders</b> proposal has a legitimate aim and it does not conflict with human rights protection, even though it limits the right to data protection as stated in Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union...|$|R
40|$|Practices {{of border}} control {{increasingly}} rely on digital biometrics {{in order to}} sort and filter cross-border movements. But while its effects are well examined in migration and border studies, less {{is known about the}} intricate ways in which biometric bordering is politically negotiated and socio-technically put into practice. Therefore, in this paper, I trace the contested emergence of one particular scheme of biometric border control currently in the making: the EU’s <b>Smart</b> <b>Borders</b> Package. Proposed by the European Commission in 2013, it aims at digitally registering all third-country nationals’ entries to and exits from the Schengen area, while simultaneously accelerating the border crossing of certain travellers. I argue that, unlike other forms of biometric <b>bordering,</b> the <b>Smart</b> <b>Borders</b> Package problematises border control primarily on the level of its temporalities and constitutes the speed of border crossings, the timing of control as well as third-country nationals’ duration of stay as distinct objects of governing. Meanwhile, the project’s political negotiations have sparked techno-political controversies that repeatedly brought it to the brink of failure. Yet, these controversies have significantly enhanced the intelligibility and practicability of biometric bordering, contributing to the emergence of what I call the self-service border...|$|R

Recommendations for program improvement include: greater regulatory cooperation between Canada and the US to reduce costly duplication and paperwork, and providing tax incentives or subsidies to small and medium-size firms as a means to increase the participation rate in the program.

40|$|On September 14 - 16, 2004, the Advanced Concepts Group of Sandia National Laboratories in {{conjunction}} with the University of Texas at El Paso and the North American Institute hosted a workshop (fest) designed to explore the concept of a North American continental approach to countering terrorism. The fest began with the basic premise that the successful defense of North America against the threat of terrorism will require close collaboration among the North American allies [...] Canada, Mexico and the U. S. [...] as well as a powerful set of information collection and analysis tools and deterrence strategies. The NorthAm Fest recast the notion of ''homeland defense'' as a tri-national effort to protect the North American continent against an evolving threat that respects no borders. This is a report of the event summarizing the ideas explored. The fest examined the uniqueness of dealing with terrorism from a tri-national North American viewpoint, the role and possible features of joint security systems, concepts for ideal continental security systems for North America, and the challenges and opportunities for such systems to become reality. The following issues were identified as most important for the advancement of this concept. (1) The three countries share a set of core values [...] democracy, prosperity and security [...] which form the basis for joint interactions and allow {{for the development of a}} culture of cooperation without affecting the sovereignty of the members. (2) The creation of a continental defensive strategy will require a set of strategic guidelines and that <b>smart</b> secure <b>borders</b> play a pivotal role. (3) Joint security systems will need to operate from a set of complementary but not identical policies and procedures. (4) There is a value in joint task forces for response and shared information systems for the prevention of attacks. (5) The private sector must play a critical role in cross-border interactions. Finally, participants envisioned a ''Tri-National Security Laboratory'' to develop and test new counter-terrorism technologies and processes. The fest was an important first step in developing a tri-national approach to continental security and very different approaches to countering terrorism were explored. Participants came to the conclusion that continental security would be easier to achieve if the focus were on broader security issues, such as transnational crime, with terrorism being only a part of the focus. A series of fledgling relationships were begun between individuals and organizations through which actions can occur.

This paper will argue that due to the concrete circumstances of the data processing and the large scale of the surveillance, the EUROSUR system constitutes a serious interference with the right to data protection and privacy. While the necessity of such an additional and intrusive border management tool is already highly questionable, in the end, the interference is not justified. In particular, the vagueness {{in most parts of the}} regulation and the lack of specific privacy protecting safeguards preclude the fulfilment of the ‘quality of law’ requirements.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Canada‟s post- 9 / 11 border policymaking {{regime and}} its effects on the Canadian trucking industry and the larger Canada-U. S. trade relationship. More specifically, it examines post- 9 / 11 policy initiatives such as the <b>Smart</b> <b>Border</b> Accord and the Security and Prosperity Partnership and aims to understand why such policies were unable to mitigate the economic losses being incurred by the trucking industry in the face of tight border controls and a newly securitized Canada-U. S. frontier. In this context, particular attention is devoted to the study of business-government relations and their role in the post- 9 / 11 policymaking process.

This paper concludes that post- 9 / 11 border policies were ineffective both in facilitating cross-border trade and mitigating economic losses to the trucking industry precisely because they failed to incorporate private-sector interests in the policymaking process; ineffective consultations, strong international forces, and a weak policymaking structure which failed to institutionalize private-sector interests were all to blame for the trucking industry‟s exclusion from the policymaking process.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a part of a larger {{research}} project that looks at the balancing of security interests and civil liberties in Canadian immigration policy-making post 9 / 11. The argument presented in this paper counters the frequently proposed assertion that Canadian policy-makers are unduly influenced by U. S. policies and politics in this area. Rather, it will be argued, Canadian sovereignty is asserted through active co-operation with the U. S. in such policies as the <b>Smart</b> <b>Border</b> Agreement, Integrated Border Enforcement Teams, and Safe Third Country Agreement. Through this active co-operation with the U. S. the Canadian Government is able to assure the U. S. of its ongoing commitment to security issues, while diverting American interest from more extreme measures such as the proposed perimeter security project. A further argument demonstrates that the very different Constitutions and political traditions of the U. S. and Canada necessarily result in very different responses to the terrorist threat. In Canada there is active public debate around the balancing of security interests and civil liberties, an independent judiciary, and independent review agencies operating at arms 2 ̆ 7 -length from the executive, while in the U.

40|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9 / 11), Canada began the process of adjusting to the new security realities. It immediately became apparent that a preeminent issue that Canada would have to address was border security, especially the matter of maintaining a secure and open border with the United States (US). Canada has always recognized the necessity of an open border with the US but 9 / 11 reinforced just how vulnerable the border was to events beyond its control. Something needed to be done in order to sustain this vital trading relationship. This thesis examines Canada’s response to the terrorist attacks of 9 / 11 but more specifically, Canada’s efforts to maintain an open and secure border with the US in {{the immediate}} months and years following the attacks. This thesis is a case study of Canada’s political efforts in that regard. The central focus is on Canada’s initiation, negotiation and signing of the <b>Smart</b> <b>Border</b> Declaration (SBD) with the US on December 12, 2001. The purpose here is to examine the driving factors that lead Canada to engage in the smart borders process with the US and assess the importance of them. This thesis concludes that Canada’s response to the border crisis has revealed three significant trends in Canada’s foreign and security policy. First, the SBD serves as a demonstration that Canada’s national security has been significantly influenced by the security of economics and in particular, the special trade relationship that exists between Canada and the US. Secondly, the SBD is a familiar case of Canada taking the initiative in a North American policy matter and achieving an impressive policy triumph. Thirdly, it shows that the SBD represented an equally familiar instance of Canada taking action to provide certain assurances to the US that the security of Canada and the US is indivisible. In essence, it was a significant effort to appear as a reliable and responsible neighbour to the US...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn North America, border studies {{generally}} {{focus on}} two land boundaries, the Canada-US and the US-Mexico borderlands. Yet, maritime borders become increasingly relevant, {{notably in the}} Arctic (Le Mière and Mazo 2013), since using the Northwest passage and exploiting raw materials in Northern polar regions may be soon possible, due to climate change, which incidentally triggers border security issues. Still, the core of border studies in North America can undoubtedly {{be found on the}} US-Mexico border. This borderland has contributed to forge an interdisciplinary research cluster that has been institutionalized in numerous academic departments. Also, the US-Mexico borderland has lead to the emergence of a solid interdisciplinary research network, the Association for Borderlands Studies (ABS), born in April 1976 in Tempe, Arizona (Pisani, Reyes and García 2009). The ABS is now a stimulating research venue for North-American and international scholars alike that welcomes varying theoretical and methodological approaches to border studies. Those multiple border perspectives in social sciences are scrutinized by Michèle Lamont and Virga Molnar (2002). They examine four main transversal research agendas: social and collective identity; class, racial and gender inequality; professions, knowledge and science; and communities, national identities and spatial boundaries. The literature on borders and border regions in North America reveals that border regions are zones of transition, that range from fully integrated borderlands to sharply divided border territories, with varying socio-economic landscapes (Martinez 1996). On the Canada-US border, smart borders are increasingly tested and implemented, so that border security measures do not disrupt the flows of people and goods (Sparke 2006). The construction of (less <b>smart)</b> <b>border</b> security apparatus, such as border walls and fences in US- Mexico border regions, can regenerate cultural production and interactions (Amilhat-Szary 2012). The criminalization of migrations in North America is also an acute research object (Dowling and India 2013). Other border policy issues, such as the environment, living standards and human development, are also scrutinized by border scholars (Anderson and Gerber 2007). In this succinct chapter, we will focus on four main sections: first, the history of borders, followed by border conflicts; third, the development of transborder relations and regions; and finally, border and transborder policies...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In {{the years since the}} 2001 terrorist attacks, balancing the need to secure U. S. borders while maintaining the flow of legitimate cross-border travel and commerce has taken on an added importance. The United States and Canada share a border that extends nearly 4, 000 miles, and one of the world's largest trading relationships. Each year, approximately 70 million travelers and 35 million vehicles cross the border from Canada into the United States, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Given the volume of cross-border travel and trade between the United States and Canada, border congestion and the resulting wait times have a substantial economic impact on both nations. Furthermore, according to an analysis by DHS, the heightened emphasis on border security following the 2001 terrorist attacks has lengthened processing time for travelers and cargo crossing into the United States. Recognizing the need to improve both border security and border-crossing efficiency, the United States and Canada have cooperated on various cross-border management initiatives intended to increase the flow of legitimate travel across the border while maintaining security. For example, to facilitate the travel of low-risk prescreened individuals across the northern border, the United States and Canada jointly operate the NEXUS program. The NEXUS program allows registered border residents and frequent cross-border travelers identified as low-risk individuals access to dedicated lanes and expedited processing with minimal inspection. The United States and Canada also coordinate on border law enforcement programs such as the Integrated Border Enforcement Team Program (IBET), which is a bi-national, multi-agency law enforcement initiative that (1) provides, where necessary, support to national security investigations associated to the Canada/United States border and (2) investigates illegal cross-border activities. A key collaborative effort to improve security and relieve congestion at the ports of entry across the northern border is to move customs and immigration inspection activities away from the border [...] a concept known as "land preclearance" or "shared border management. " In December 2004, the United States and Canada announced that the two governments had agreed to move forward with a land preclearance pilot project at the Buffalo, New York-Fort Erie, Ontario Peace Bridge and at one other border crossing site along the northern border, which had not yet been determined. The land preclearance pilot project flowed from the 2001 <b>Smart</b> <b>Border</b> Declaration and its associated action plan, which was meant to enhance the security along the northern border while facilitating information sharing and the legitimate flow of people and goods, and securing infrastructure. The preclearance pilot at the Peace Bridge would involve the relocation of all U. S. border inspection operations for both commercial and passenger traffic from the U. S. side of the border in Buffalo, New York, to the Canadian side of the border in Fort Erie, Ontario. From 2005 to 2007, the United States and Canada were engaged in negotiations to implement land preclearance at the Buffalo-Fort Erie Peace Bridge ports of entry. However, in April 2007, these negotiations were officially terminated by DHS.
