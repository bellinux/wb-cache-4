2500|$|During World War II, Trafford Park {{became an}} {{important}} centre for the manufacture and development in engineering in the aim of giving Britain a technological advantage over its enemies. Having an abandoned factory in Trafford Park, Ford of Britain was approached {{about the possibility of}} converting it into an aircraft engine production unit by Herbert Austin, {{who was in charge of}} the shadow factory plan. Building work on a new factory was started in May 1940 on a [...] site, while Ford engineers went on a fact finding mission to Derby. Their chief engineer commented to Sir Stanley Hooker that the tolerances used were far too wide for them, and so the 20,000 drawings would need to be redrawn to Ford tolerance levels, which took over a year. Ford's factory was built with two distinct sections to minimise potential bomb damage, it was completed in May 1941 and bombed in the same month. At first, the factory had difficulty in attracting suitable labour, and large numbers of women, youths and untrained men had to be taken on. Despite this, the first Merlin engine came off the production line one month later and it was building the engine at a rate of 200 per week by 1943, at which point the joint factories were producing 18,000 Merlins per year. Ford’s investment in machinery and the redesign resulted in the 10,000 man-hours needed to produce a Merlin dropping to 2,727 in three years, while unit cost fell from £6,540 in June 1941 to £1,180 by the war’s end. In his autobiography Not much of an Engineer, Sir Stanley Hooker states: [...] "...once the great Ford factory at Manchester started production, Merlins came out like <b>shelling</b> <b>peas.</b> The percentage of engines rejected by the Air Ministry was zero. Not one engine of the 30,400 produced was rejected...". Some 17,316 people worked at the Trafford Park plant, including 7,260 women and two resident doctors and nurses. Merlin production started to run down in August 1945, and finally ceased on 23 March 1946.|$|E

A lot of well established literature is already available on the role of dyes as a major cause in skin and respiratory diseases. The adsorbents which are of low cost, locally available and are relatively new for their acidic dyes removal capacity from aqueous solutions were investigated. Bagasse, cow dung, groundnut <b>shells,</b> <b>pea</b> <b>shells,</b> used tea leaves, wheat straw were used in their charcoal form whereas brick kiln ash and cement kiln ash adsorbents were used as such for the removal of acid violet 17, acid violet 49, acid violet 54, acid blue 15 and acid red 119. The effects of various experimental parameters, initial pH, dye concentration, sorbent dosage, ion strength, contact time were examined and optimal experimental conditions were decided. At initial basic pH more than 8. 0, all the five dyes studied could be removed effectively. The isothermal data for adsorption followed the Freundlich and Langmuir models. The adsorption results in this study indicated that all the adsorbents were attractive candidates for removing acidic dyes from dye wastewater...|$|R

These machines could remove as many peas from pods as 600 workers could do by hand, vastly improving the efficiency of this branch of agriculture. The pea-viners were sold both in Canada and the United States and the company found a large market for their product. The Chisholm-Scott Company had a factory and office in Niagara Falls, Ontario in addition to offices in Baltimore and Suspension Bridge, New York. On June 27, 1893 an improved pea-huller machine was created by the company.|$|R
