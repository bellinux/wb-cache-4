5|$|Bonhoeffer et al. {{suggested}} that template switching by the reverse transcriptase {{acts as a}} repair process to deal with breaks in the <b>ssRNA</b> genome. In addition, Hu and Temin {{suggested that}} recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged <b>ssRNA</b> genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. On the view that that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.|$|E
5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with {{single-stranded}} DNA genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), depending on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the template strand for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (−), and the coding strand is a copy of it (+). However, several types of ssDNA and <b>ssRNA</b> viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are <b>ssRNA</b> viruses of animals.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhile Dicer {{alone has}} been shown to form stable {{complexes}} with double-stranded RNAs and short interfering RNAs, its interactions with single-stranded RNAs (<b>ssRNAs)</b> have not been characterized. Here, we show that recombinant human Dicer alone can bind 21 -nt <b>ssRNAs</b> in vitro, independent of their sequence and structure. We also demonstrate that Dicer binds <b>ssRNAs</b> having a 5 ′-phosphate with greater affinity versus those with a 5 ′-hydroxyl. In addition, 3 ′-biotinylated <b>ssRNAs</b> are bound by Dicer with lower affinity than 3 ′-hydroxyl <b>ssRNAs.</b> The stability of ssRNA–Dicer complexes was found to depend on divalent cations. Together, our results suggest a role for the PAZ domain of Dicer in binding <b>ssRNAs</b> and may indicate roles for Dicer in cellular function beyond those currently known...|$|R

This increased risk is linked to persistent inflammation and chronic immune activation. In this study, we assessed whether this complication is related to HIV-derived <b>ssRNAs</b> inducing in macrophages increases in TNFa release through TLR 8 activation leading to foam cell formation. HIV <b>ssRNAs</b> induced foam cell formation in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in a dose-dependent manner. This response was reduced when either endocytosis or endosomal acidification was inhibited by dynasore or chloroquine, respectively. Using a flow cytometry FRET assay, we demonstrated that <b>ssRNAs</b> bind to TLR 8 in HEK cells. In MDMs, <b>ssRNAs</b> triggered a TLR 8 -mediated inflammatory response that ultimately lead to foam cell formation. Targeted silencing of the TLR 8 and MYD 88 genes reduced foam cell formation. Furthermore, foam cell formation induced by these <b>ssRNAs</b> was blocked by an anti-TNFa neutralizing antibody. Taken together in MDMs, HIV <b>ssRNAs</b> are internalized; bind TLR 8 in the endosome followed by endosomal acidification. TLR 8 signaling then triggers TNFa release and ultimately leads to foam cell formation. As this response was inhibited by a blocking anti-TNFa antibody, drug targeting HIV ssRNA-driven TLR 8 activation may serve as a potential therapeutic target to reduce chronic immune activation and inflammation leading t...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{distinct}} functional classes of single-stranded RNAs (<b>ssRNAs)</b> {{and the number}} of sequences representing them are substantial and continue to increase. Organizing this data in an evolutionary context is essential, yet traditional comparative sequence analyses require that homologous sites can be identified. This prevents comparative analysis between sequences of different functional classes that share no site-to-site sequence similarity. Analysis within a single evolutionary lineage also limits evolutionary inference because shared ancestry confounds properties of molecular structure and function that are historically contingent with those that are imposed for biophysical reasons. Here, we apply a method of comparative analysis to <b>ssRNAs</b> that is not restricted to homologous sequences, and therefore enables comparison between distantly related or unrelated sequences, minimizing the effects of shared ancestry. This method is based on statistical similarities in nucleotide base composition among different functional classes of <b>ssRNAs.</b> In order to denote base composition unambiguously, we have calculated the fraction G+A and G+U content, in addition to the more commonly used fraction G+C content. These three parameters define RNA composition space, which we have visualized using interactive graphics software. We have examined the distribution of nucleotide composition from 15 distinct functional classes of <b>ssRNAs</b> from organisms spanning the universal phylogenetic tree and artificial ribozymes evolved in vitro. Surprisingly, these distributions are biased consistently in G+A and G+U content, both within and between functional classes, regardless of the more variable G+C content. Additionally, an analysis of the base composition of secondary structural elements indicates that paired and unpaired nucleotides, known to have different evolutionary rates, also have significantly different compositional biases. These universal compositional biases observed among <b>ssRNAs</b> sharing little or no sequence similarity suggest, contrary to current understanding, that base composition biases constitute a convergent adaptation among a wide variety of molecular functions...|$|R
5|$|In general, RNA viruses have smaller genome sizes than DNA viruses {{because of}} a higher error-rate when replicating, and have a maximum upper size limit. Beyond this limit, errors in the genome when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive. To {{compensate}} for this, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes– the genome is split into smaller molecules– thus reducing the chance that an error in a single-component genome will incapacitate the entire genome. In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes {{because of the high}} fidelity of their replication enzymes. Single-strand DNA viruses are an exception to this rule, however, as mutation rates for these genomes can approach the extreme of the <b>ssRNA</b> virus case.|$|E
5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses: These have <b>ssRNA</b> (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or dsDNA (Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae) {{in their}} particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA {{intermediate}} to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a reverse transcriptase, or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, {{to carry out}} the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by reverse transcription into the host genome as a provirus {{as a part of the}} replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus. They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine. An example of the first type is HIV, which is a retrovirus. Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae, which includes Hepatitis B virus.|$|E
25|$|In virology, {{the term}} {{may also be}} used when {{referring}} to mRNA synthesis from an RNA molecule (i.e., RNA replication). For instance, the genome of a negative-sense single-stranded RNA (<b>ssRNA</b> -) virus may be template for a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (<b>ssRNA</b> +). This is because the positive-sense strand contains the information needed to translate the viral proteins for viral replication afterwards. This process is catalyzed by a viral RNA replicase.|$|E
40|$|At {{present the}} ability to create rationally {{engineered}} mutant rotaviruses is limited {{because of the lack of}} a tractable helper virus-free reverse genetics system. Using the cell culture adapted bovine RV RF strain (G 6 P 6 [1]), we have attempted to recover infectious RV by co-transfecting in vitro transcribed <b>ssRNAs</b> which are identical in sequence to the positive sense strand of each of the 11 dsRNA genomic segments of the RF strain. The RNAs were produced either from cDNAs cloned by a target sequence-independent procedure, or from purified double layered RV particles (DLPs). We have validated their translational function by in vitro synthesis of (35) S-labelled proteins in rabbit reticulocyte lysates; all 11 proteins encoded by the RV genome were expressed. Transfection experiments with DLP- or cDNA-derived <b>ssRNAs</b> suggested that the RNAs do not act independently as mRNAs for protein synthesis, once delivered into various mammalian cell lines, and exhibit cytotoxicity. Transfected RNAs were not infectious since a viral cytopathic effect was not observed after infection of MA 104 cells with lysates from transfected cells. By contrast, an engineered mRNA encoding eGFP was expressed when transfected under identical conditions into the same cell lines. Co-expression of plasmids encoding NSP 2 and NSP 5 using a fowlpox T 7 polymerase recombinant virus revealed viroplasm-like structure formation, but this did not enable the translation of transfected RV <b>ssRNAs.</b> Attempts to recover RV from <b>ssRNAs</b> transcribed intracellularly from transfected cDNAs were also unsuccessful and suggested that these RNAs were also not translated, in contrast to successful translation from a transfected cDNA encoding an eGFP mRNA...|$|R
40|$|Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a vector-borne, nonenveloped {{icosahedral}} particle that {{is organized}} in two capsids, an outer capsid of two proteins, VP 2 and VP 5, and an inner capsid (or core) {{composed of two}} major proteins, VP 7 and VP 3, in two layers.

Here, we established a cell-free system to reconstitute subcore and core structures with the proteins and <b>ssRNAs,</b> demonstrating that reconstituted cores are infectious in insect cells. Furthermore, we showed that the BTV <b>ssRNAs</b> are essential to drive the assembly reaction {{and that there is a}} distinct order of internal protein recruitment during the assembly process.

5|$|The RNAi pathway {{is found}} in many eukaryotes, {{including}} animals, and is initiated by the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into short double-stranded fragments of ~20 nucleotide siRNAs. Each siRNA is unwound into two single-stranded RNAs (<b>ssRNAs),</b> the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RISC complex. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.|$|R

A rapid and high-throughput GenomeLab Gene Expression Profiler (GeXP) analyzer-based multiplex PCR assay was developed for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of these six cattle viruses. Six pairs of chimeric primers consisting of both the gene-specific primer and a universal primer were designed and used for amplification. Then capillary electrophoresis was used to separate the fluorescent labeled PCR products according to the amplicons size. The specificity of GeXP-multiplex PCR assay was examined with samples of the single template and mixed template of six viruses. The sensitivity was evaluated using the GeXP-multiplex PCR assay on serial 10 -fold dilutions of <b>ssRNAs</b> obtained via in vitro transcription. To further evaluate the reliability, 305 clinical samples were tested by the GeXP-multiplex PCR assay. The results showed that the corresponding virus specific fragments of genes were amplified. The detection limit of the GeXP-multiplex PCR assay was 100 copies/μL in a mixed sample of <b>ssRNAs</b> containing target genes of six different cattle viruses, whereas the detection limit for the Gexp-mono PCR assay for a single target gene was 10 copies/μL. In detection of viruses in 305 clinical samples, the results of GeXP were consistent with simplex real-time PCR. Analysis of positive samples by sequencing demonstrated that the GeXP-multiplex PCR assay had no false positive samples of nonspecific amplification. In conclusion, this GeXP-multiplex PCR assay is a high throughput, specific, sensitive, rapid and simple method for the detection and differentiation of six cattle viruses. It is an effective tool that can be applied for the rapid differential diagnosis of clinical samples and for epidemiological investigation...|$|R

2500|$|... 75% {{of plant}} viruses have genomes that consist of single {{stranded}} RNA (<b>ssRNA).</b> 65% of plant viruses have +ssRNA, {{meaning that they}} are in the same sense orientation as messenger RNA but 10% have -ssRNA, meaning they must be converted to +ssRNA before they can be translated. 5% are double stranded RNA and so can be immediately translated as +ssRNA viruses. 3% require a reverse transcriptase enzyme to convert between RNA and DNA. 17% of plant viruses are ssDNA and very few are dsDNA, in contrast a quarter of animal viruses are dsDNA and three quarters of bacteriophage are dsDNA. Viruses use the plant ribosomes to produce the 4-10 proteins encoded by their genome. However, since many of the proteins are encoded on a single strand (that is, they are polycistronic) this will mean that the ribosome will either only produce one protein, as it will terminate translation at the first stop codon, or that a polyprotein will be produced. Plant viruses have had to evolve special techniques to allow the production of viral proteins by plant cells.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRotavirus (RV) cores were {{released}} from double-layered particles (DLPs) by {{high concentrations of}} CaCl 2, purified and ‘opened’ by treatment with EDTA or EGTA. Under appropriate in vitro conditions DLPs {{have been shown to}} have transcriptase and ‘open cores’ replicase activity. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that transcriptase activity and infectivity of native cores can be restored by transcapsidation with VP 6, VP 7 and VP 4. The missing link for particle reconstitution in vitro has been the manipulation of ‘open cores’ to become functionally active cores again. The experiments described here were undertaken with the aim of exploring packaging of RV RNAs into opened cores in vitro. Rotavirus cores were opened by approximately 200 μM EGTA, leading to the release of genomic dsRNA. Conversely, RV cores were found to be stable in the presence of minimum concentrations of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, spermidine 3 + and cobalthexamine 3 + of between 40 and 300 μM. Aggregates of purified cores were resolved in the presence of 0. 3 mM deoxycholate (minimum concentration). Core shells opened with EGTA were reconstituted by the addition of di- or trivalent cations within 2 min of the opening procedure. Addition of purified, baculovirus recombinant-expressed VP 6 to native and reconstituted cores {{led to the formation of}} DLPs or DLP-like particles, which upon transfection into MA 104 cells were infectious. The rescued infectivity likely originated in part from unopened and in part from reconstituted cores. Radiolabelled RV (+) <b>ssRNAs</b> could be packaged into reconstituted cores and DLPs, as indicated by resistance to RNase I digestion. The packaging reaction was, however, not RV RNA sequence-specific, since unrelated <b>ssRNAs,</b> such as those transcribed from HIV- 2 cDNAs, were also packaged.
