This included the loss of about 2.5million housing units, which rendered 8.5million people homeless. The urban area attacks reduced {{the morale of the}} Japanese population, and postwar surveys conducted by the USSBS found that air attacks were {{the most important factor in}} convincing the Japanese that the war had been lost. During the final months of the war the raids also contributed to the deterioration of the Japanese <b>social</b> <b>fabric.</b> However, civilian morale did not collapse due to the bombing, and post-war investigations found that most Japanese had remained willing to continue the war if necessary.|$|E

The impact of the war was felt in many other areas as well. Financially it was very costly, while the effect on the social and political landscape was considerable and threatened to cause serious divides in the nation's <b>social</b> <b>fabric.</b> Conscription was possibly the most contentious issue and ultimately, despite having conscription for home service, Australia was one of only two combatants not to use conscripts in the fighting. Nevertheless, for many Australians the nation's involvement in World War I and the Gallipoli campaign was seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of the Australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war and Anzac Day is commemorated as a national holiday.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study is to apply the Human Security Index (HSI) as a tool to detect social and {{economic}} cumulative risk burden at a county-level in the state of Texas. The HSI is an index comprising a network of three sub-components or “fabrics”; the Economic, Environmental, and <b>Social</b> <b>Fabrics.</b> We hypothesized that the HSI will be a useful instrument for identifying and analyzing socioeconomic conditions that contribute to cumulative risk burden in vulnerable counties. We expected to identify statistical associations between cumulative risk burden and (a) ethnic concentration and (b) geographic proximity to the Texas-Mexico border. Findings from this study indicate that the Texas-Mexico border region did not have consistently higher total or individual fabric scores as would be suggested by the high disease burden and low income in this region. While the Economic, Environmental, <b>Social</b> <b>Fabrics</b> (including the Health subfabric) were highly associated with Hispanic ethnic concentration, the overall HSI and the Crime subfabric were not. In addition, the Education, Health and Crime subfabrics were associated with African American racial composition, while Environment, Economic and <b>Social</b> <b>Fabrics</b> were not.
