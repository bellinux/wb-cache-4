5|$|In June 2016 Operation Grange {{officers}} {{interviewed a}} victim of the deceased broadcaster Clement Freud, who was accused that year of having a history of child sexual abuse. Freud had had a home in Praia da Luz, and had befriended the McCanns in July 2007, weeks after the disappearance. His family <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the UK when Madeleine went missing.|$|E
5|$|After he was rammed by his {{teammate}} Brian Vickers in the UAW-Ford 500, Johnson said the expectations {{for him to}} succeed at Lowe's Motor Speedway were high and hoped the track's surface would be more predictable. Martin <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the best position {{that he had been}} in for several years to win the championship, and spoke of his waning interest in looking at race results. Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the Nextel Cup races, Earnhardt stated he need to secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle. Gordon had driven well at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car he drove to victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it would help him at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although he had a poor start in the chase, Kahne rectified this by finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, he had {{received}} worrying British intelligence reports that <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> danger of being assassinated and his country may face a coup d'état. His tribesmen were unhappy at Habibullah's perceived subservience to the British, and his council and relatives openly spoke of their suspicions at his inactivity. Habibullah began purging his court of officials who {{were known to be}} close to Nasrullah and Amanullah. He recalled emissaries he had sent to Persia for talks with Germany and Turkey for military aid. Meanwhile, the war took {{a turn for the worse}} for the Central Powers. The Arab revolt against Turkey and the loss of Erzurum to the Russians ended the hopes of sending a Turkish division to Afghanistan. The German influence in Persia also declined rapidly, ending the hopes that Goltz Pasha could lead a Persian volunteer division into Afghanistan. The mission came to realise that the Emir deeply mistrusted them. A further attempt by British intelligence to feed false information to the mission, purportedly originating from Goltz Pasha, convinced von Hentig of the Emir's lack of trust. A last offer was made by Nasrullah in May 1916 to remove Habibullah from power and lead the frontier tribes in a campaign against British India. However, von Hentig knew it would come to nothing, and the Germans left Kabul on 21 May 1916. Niedermayer instructed Wagner to stay in Herat as a liaison officer. The Indian members also stayed, persisting in their attempts at an alliance.|$|E

25|$|In {{complying}} with the Senate's wishes, Marius tried to show the senate, who had always been suspicious of his motives, {{that he was one}} of them instead of the outsider that Quintus Metellus <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> 108 BC. Marius' overall concern, for his part, was always how to maintain the Senate's esteem: in the words of the scholar A.N. Sherwin-White, Marius 'wanted to end his days as vir censorius, like the other great worthies among the novi homines of the second century'.|$|E

He also announced that he was more optimistic after this meeting, and that he focused only on the solutions that could be applied by NATO's summit in April.|$|E

25|$|The police {{initially}} {{identified the}} 18-year-old brother-in-law of Chérif Kouachi, a French Muslim student of North African descent and unknown nationality, {{as a third}} suspect in the shooting, accused of driving the getaway car. He was {{believed to have been}} living in Charleville-Mézières, about 200km northeast of Paris near the border with Belgium. He turned himself in at a Charleville-Mézières police station early in the morning on 8 January 2015. The man <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> class {{at the time of the}} shooting, and that he rarely saw Chérif Kouachi. Many of his classmates said that he was at school in Charleville-Mézières during the attack. After holding him for about 50 hours, police said that he was not being charged at that time.|$|E

25|$|Cory and {{his family}} were devoutly Protestant and hostile to the Roman Catholic religion. Cory was noted for his {{interest}} in temperance and Low Church evangelism. He was a particular friend of Capel Zion at Ponthir in Monmouthshire. He was also a vice-president of the council of the Christian Service Union, an organisation with the aim of providing work and training for unemployed and vagrant boys and youths. In 1898, Cory {{was the head of the}} Welsh Protestant League, which had a reputation for being rabidly anti-Catholic. This background undoubtedly influenced his strong support for the Protestant, Unionist, opponents of the traditional Liberal policy of Irish Home Rule. He voted against the government in 1911 supporting an amendment which would have excluded any Home Rule Bill from the operation of the Parliament Bill. In April 1912, Cory was the only Liberal MP to vote against the government in the first reading of the Home Rule Bill. He voted against the Bill again on second reading repeated his rebellion on the third reading of the Bill on 7 July 1913. On 14 May 1914, Cory presided at an anti-Home Rule meeting at Caxton Hall, Westminster. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a unique position in that he was the only Liberal member returned as a declared opponent of Home Rule. At each of the last three elections he had distinctly put in his address that he would oppose Home Rule.|$|E

500|$|In 1943, Shaughnessy {{replaced}} Pittsburgh {{head coach}} Charles W. Bowser, who had {{applied for a}} commission in the United States Navy. The University of Pittsburgh had de-emphasized football, a move with which Shaughnessy <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> accordance. He also {{said he would not}} guarantee any number of wins as coach. During this time, Shaughnessy had to contend with the loss of players to the wartime draft. At Pittsburgh, his teams compiled a 10–17 record from 1943 to 1945 without a winning season. In 1943, the National Safety Council honored him with an award for [...] "developing and applying coaching methods that provide maximum protection for the players." ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{introduction}} to the published screenplay, Dear <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> part attracted to adapt Persuasion because it depicted a [...] "world in transition". To him, the novel showed [...] "an old order fading away into decadence, and a new tribe, a meritocracy, coming to the fore". While directing, Roger Michell felt that the story included [...] "the prototype of the postmodern family"—Anne's mother is dead, her father is bankrupt, and [...] "the old social orders are breaking down". Root described Anne as a [...] "feminist in a prefeminist period" [...] and a [...] "strong, independent character", to whom modern viewers can relate despite the story's period setting.|$|E

[...] according to Emanuel Alfano, chairman of the Italian-American One Voice Committee. Alfano reported that when introduced to a lawyer named David Stein, Corzine said: [...] "He's not Italian, is he? Oh, I guess he's your Jewish lawyer who is here to get the rest of you out of jail."

500|$|On 2 March 2007, Paul Joyal, {{a former}} {{director}} of security for the U.S. Senate intelligence committee, who the previous weekend alleged on national television that the Kremlin was involved in the poisoning of Litvinenko, was shot near his Maryland home. An FBI spokesman said the agency was [...] "assisting" [...] the police investigation into the shooting. Police would not confirm details of the shooting or of the condition of Joyal. A person familiar with the case <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> critical condition in hospital. It was reported that while there were no indications that the shooting was linked to the Litvinenko case, it is unusual for the FBI to get involved in a local shooting incident. A person familiar with the situation said NBC had hired bodyguards for some of the journalists involved in the program.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{being told}} of the killings, Suharto went to KOSTRAD {{headquarters}} just before dawn from where he could see soldiers occupying Merdeka Square. He mobilized KOSTRAD and RPKAD (now Kopassus) special forces to seize control of the centre of Jakarta, capturing key strategic sites including the radio station without resistance. Suharto announced over the radio at 9:00pm that six generals had been kidnapped by [...] "counter-revolutionaries" [...] and that the 30 September Movement actually intended to overthrow Sukarno. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> control of the army, {{and that he would}} crush the 30 September Movement and safeguard Sukarno. Suharto issued an ultimatum to Halim Air Force Base, where the G30S had based themselves and where Sukarno, air force commander Omar Dhani and PKI chairman Dipa Nusantara Aidit had gathered, causing them to disperse before Suhartoist soldiers occupied the air base on 2 October after short fighting. With the failure of the poorly organised coup, and having secured authority from the president to restore order and security, Suharto's faction was firmly in control of the army by 2 October (he was officially appointed army commander on 14 October). On 5 October, Suharto led a dramatic public ceremony to bury the generals' bodies.|$|E
