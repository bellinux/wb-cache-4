A <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer. <b>Supply</b> <b>chain</b> activities involve the transformation of natural resources, raw materials, and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer. In sophisticated <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> systems, used products may re-enter the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> at any point where residual value is recyclable. Supply chains link value chains. Supply and demand can be very fickle, depending on factors such as the weather, consumer demand, and large orders placed by multinational corporations.|$|E

40|$|Forests are {{essential}} suppliers {{of raw materials}} for industrial products and renewable energy, which can help mitigate climate change. In Europe, the market for forest bioenergy and other wood products {{is expected to continue}} growing in the future. Therefore, new procurement methods and assortments with high energy efficiencies and low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are required from a climate change perspective. One alternative to current conventional <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> is utilizing integrated <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> where residual forest biomass is harvested and transported together with stemwood. Additionally, mobile production systems, such as small-scale mobile pellet plants that are situated close to the raw material source, could increase the efficiency of residual forest biomass <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> especially in regions with long transportation distances to industry. The overall aim of this thesis was to assess the cost, energy use, GHG emissions and other relevant environmental impacts (terrestrial acidification, marine and fresh water eutrophication, photochemical oxidant formation and fossil fuel depletion) of conventional and integrated forest <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> in Northern Sweden to provide knowledge that could stimulate the development of more efficient <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> The assessment included modelling of conventional and integrated forest <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> in Northern Sweden, a case study in Western Canada, and modelling of a mobile production system for pelletizing logging residues. A life cycle assessment approach was used in the analyses. The results showed that integrated <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> have the potential to reduce the supply cost for non-stemwood assortments. Furthermore, the integrated <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> were more energy efficient than conventional <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> and have the potential to reduce GHG emissions by approximately 13...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Healthcare is a universally used {{service that}} hugely affects economies {{and the quality}} of life. The {{research}} of service <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> has found {{a significant role in the}} past decade. The main research goal of this paper is to model and simulate the internal service <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> of a healthcare system to study the effects of different parameters on the outputs and capability measures of the processes. The specific objectives are to analyse medication delivery errors in a community hospital based on the results of the models and to explore the presence of bullwhip effect in the internal service <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> of the hospital. Design/methodology/approach: System dynamics which is an approach for understanding the behaviour of complex systems, used as a methodology to model two internal service <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> of the hospital with a sub-model created to simulate medication delivery errors in the hospital. The models are validated using the actual data of the hospital and the results are analyzed based on experimental design techniques. Findings: It is observed that the bullwhip effect may not occur in a hospital’s internal service <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> Furthermore the paper points out the conditions for reducing the medication delivery error in a hospital. Research limitations/implications: Because of the community hospital’s data availability the type of service <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> modelled in this paper, are small service <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> representing only the tasks which are done inside the hospital. To better observe the bullwhip effect in healthcare service <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> the chains should be modelled more generally.
