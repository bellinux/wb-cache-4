40|$|Objectives: It is {{desirable}} that {{the surfaces of}} surgical implants be uncontaminated by foreign materials to avoid untoward tissue reactions, and <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> is widely assumed to leave clean metal surfaces. SEM examination and X-ray microanalysis of a recovered 'pure' titanium implant casting that was associated with tissue breakdown revealed embedded particles of alumina. The casting had been cleaned of investment by <b>blasting</b> with alumina <b>grit.</b> Methods: A variety of treatments of cast titanium plates was used: (a) to establish that the observed aluminium {{was due to the}} <b>blasting</b> <b>grit,</b> and (b) to determine whether removal of investment could be achieved effectively by other means. SEM examination and X-ray microanalysis were used. Results: The detected aluminium was associated with embedded fragments identified as coming from the <b>blasting</b> <b>grit.</b> Acid-pickling and mechanical (rotary instrument) trimming produced minimally contaminated surfaces. Conclusions: Whilst unproven, the presence of the alumina is viewed with great concern as a possible causative agent in the observed tissue breakdown and procedures avoiding alumina blasting are recommended as a precautionary measure. © 1995. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

WC- 12 %Co powders were sprayed by high {{velocity}} oxygen fuel (HVOF) to prepare coatings on carbon steel substrate, which was pretreated by electrospark and <b>grit</b> <b>blast</b> before spraying. The surface coating of WC-Co and the intermediate layer structure were studied by {{scanning electron microscopy}} and X-ray diffraction.

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to carry out a {{comparison}} of <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> and other surface pretreatment processes and identify the relation between <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> parameters and coating adhesion, because it can be assumed that the adhesion between substrate and coating strongly depends on the physical properties of the substrate surface. By this way, in order to improve the bonding between substrate and coating, it is necessary to study the influence of different surface pre-treatment parameters and to compare different pre-treatment techniques. <b>Grit</b> <b>blasting,</b> water jet blasting and mechanicals processes (milling and grinding) have been studied. In order to compare them, the roughness of the surface, the adhesive straights, the topography, the contact surface and the residual stresses have been the considered parameters to carry out the research. Two different substrates have been studied, AlMg 7 and St_ 42. For <b>grit</b> <b>blasting,</b> five different blasting parameters have been analyzed and combined to obtain reliable results, attack angle, air pressure, lineal velocity, number of passes, and distance between substrate and nozzle. After measuring the obtained values, the most influence parameters were recombined and analyzed to obtain better surface conditions. In the case of mechanicals processes (milling and grinding), the samples were studied for different mechanical parameters, analyzed and compared with the other surface pretreatments in order to obtain the most suitable method. For water jet blasting, eight samples were sent to WLH (University of Hannover) to be treated. To carry out the pretreatment, the velocity of the water jet blasting was modify while the other blasting parameters remained constant, in order to compare the obtained values of roughness, adhesion, activate area and residual stresses for water jet with <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> and mechanical processes. The next conclusions can be assumed: The roughness is not so important than the topography to obtain the best adhesive bonding between the substrate and the coating, and the best bonding was obtained for homogeneous topographies (obtained for water jet <b>blasting</b> and <b>grit</b> <b>blasting).</b> Comparing the surface pretreatments is observed that water jet blasting is the surface pretreatment method which leads to the highest bonding between substrate and coating. It can be assumed that a higher contact surface area leads to a better adhesion between substrate and coating. The residual stresses strongly depend on the surface pretreatment used. <b>Grit</b> <b>blasting</b> leads to the highest compressive stresses while water jet blasting almost does not cause variations and grinding obtains the same values than for a raw surface (untreated surface).

Ovine Total Hip Replacement surgery was performed with roughened femoral heads {{in order to enhance}} wear debris generation in vivo. The resistance to aseptic loosening of acetabular components with different surface coatings was investigated. Implants remained in vivo for 1 year. Sheep were {{randomly assigned to one of}} six experimental groups where the acetabular cup was fixed utilising an: (a) cemented polyethylene acetabular cup, (b) metal backed <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface, (c) metal backed plasma sprayed titanium porous coating, (d) metal backed sintered beaded coating, (e) Hydroxyapatite (HA) -coated <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface (f) and HA-coated porous components. Ground Reaction Force (GRF) was used to asses the functional performance of the implants and data was collected pre-operatively and at 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks post op. Wear debris generated was analysed and radiographs taken prior to preparation of thin sections. Fibrous tissue (FT) thickness and bone contact at 1 mm intervals along the acetabular bone-implant interface was calculated. GRF data demonstrated significant differences between experimental groups. In all groups there was an increase in the function of the hip after surgery and up to 24 weeks but thereafter the function of the group with the <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface reduced whereas the function of the other groups did not significantly change. Average wear particles generated were < 1 microm in size. The cemented group demonstrated a significantly thicker average FT layer (2. 69 mm) when compared with all other groups (p< 0. 05 in all cases) except the <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> group (1. 56 mm). HA porous coated cups demonstrated significantly least fibrous tissue adjacent to its interface when compared with all other groups (cemented p< 0. 05, <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> p= 0. 029, porous p< 0. 05, sintered beads p< 0. 05 and HA <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> p< 0. 05).

Superbond C and B resin cement was applied to the treated titanium surfaces including controls. SBSs were determined after thermocycling for 5000 cycles. Data (megapascal) were analyzed by ANOVA and Bonferroni test. Results: Group 4 (<b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> using 110 µm Al 2 O 3 particles, chemical treatment using 1 N hydrochloric acid, and application of alloy primer) produced the highest bond strength followed by group 1, group 3, group 2, and the control group which showed the least bond strength. Conclusion: (1) Air-abrasion with alumina particles increases the micromechanical retention of the resin to titanium.

Group 4 had significantly higher torque than Group 3 (Tibia: 13. 67 > 9. 07 N-cm; Femur: 18. 21 > 14. 12 N-cm), Group 4 (Tibia: 13. 67 > 9. 78 N-cm; Femur: 18. 21 > 12. 87 N-cm), and machined (Tibia: 13. 67 > 4. 08 N-cm; Femur: 18. 21 > 6. 49 N-cm). SEM analysis reveals significantly more bone implant gap in machined implant surfaces than treated implant surfaces. Bone to implant contact had significantly higher values for treated mini implant surface than machined surface. Hardness of the bone near the implant bone interface is 20 to 25 % less hard than bone 1 mm away from it in both Femur and Tibia. Conclusion: Surface roughness and wettability of mini implants influences their biological response. <b>Grit</b> <b>blasted</b> and acid etched mini implants had lowest contact angle for different liquids tested and highest removal torques...|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} surface preparation method of Inconel 625 and 718 nickel-base alloys {{in the form of}} sheets on wettability of the surface. The results of the investigations of surface preparation method (such as nicro-blasting, nickel plating, etching, degreasing, abrasive <b>blasting</b> with <b>grit</b> 120 and 220 and manually grinding with grit 120 and 240) on spreading of BNi- 2 and BNi- 3 brazing filler metals, widely used in the aerospace industry in high temperature vacuum brazing processes, are presented. Technological parameters of vacuum brazing process are shown. The macro- and microscopic analysis have shown that nicro-blasting does not bring any benefits of wettability of the alloys investigated...|$|R
