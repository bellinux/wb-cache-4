25|$|Geckos, skinks, {{and other}} lizards that are {{captured}} by the tail will shed part of the tail structure through a process called autotomy and thus be able to flee. The detached tail will continue to wiggle, creating a deceptive sense of continued struggle and distracting the predator's attention from the fleeing prey animal. The detached tails of leopard geckos can wiggle for up to 20 minutes. In many species the tails are of a separate and dramatically more intense color {{than the rest of}} the body so as to encourage potential predators to strike for the tail first. In the <b>shingleback</b> <b>skink</b> and some species of geckos, the tail is short and broad and resembles the head, so that the predators may attack it rather than the more vulnerable front part.|$|E

50|$|Reptiles and {{amphibians}} {{at the zoo}} include <b>shingleback</b> <b>skink,</b> blotched blue-tongued skink, green iguana, rhinoceros iguana, Taiwan beauty snake, reticulated python, Malayan blood python, olive python, boa constrictor, American alligator, pig-nosed turtle, and White's tree frogs, eastern dwarf tree frog and magnificent tree frog.|$|E
5000|$|It has a {{triangular}} {{head and a}} bright blue tongue. [...] Its short, stumpy tail is similar in shape to its head. This possibly evolved as a defence mechanism against predators, and {{has led to the}} common name of [...] "two-headed skink". [...] Its short tail also contains fat reserves, which the lizard lives upon during brumation in winter. Unlike many <b>skinks,</b> <b>shinglebacks</b> do not exhibit autotomy and cannot shed their tails.|$|R
50|$|The eastern blue-tongued lizard is a stout {{and slow}} lizard with brown to grey scales and a barred pattern across {{the body and}} tail. The {{underside}} is usually pale. Blue-tongued lizards are popular as pets and can live up to 30 years in captivity. They give birth to live young, between six and a record 20 per litter. The young consume the egg sac immediately after birth. They resemble the adult form closely. Several other types of blue-tongued lizard are in the genus Tiliqua, such as the northern blue-tongued <b>skink</b> and the <b>shingleback</b> or stump-tailed <b>skink.</b>|$|R

40|$|A new species, Eimeria tiliquae n. sp. is {{described}} from a <b>shingleback</b> <b>skink</b> (Tiliqua rugosa rugosa). Sporulated oocysts (n=. 50) are spherical to subspherical, with colourless trilaminate oocyst wall, 0. 7 ± 0. 1 (0. 5 - 0. 75) thick. Oocyst with 4 spheroidal to subspheroidal sporocysts. Oocyst length, 13. 7 ± 0. 9 (12. 0 - 16. 3); oocyst width, 12. 8 ± 0. 9 (11. 5 - 15. 0); oocyst length/width (L/W) ratio, 1. 07 ± 0. 05 (1. 0 - 1. 2). Micropyle, oocyst residuum and polar granule absent. Sporocysts with globular sporocyst residuum and 2 sporozoites. Sporocyst length, 6. 0 ± 0. 6 (5. 0 - 7. 5); sporocyst width, 5. 4 ± 0. 6 (4. 0 - 7. 0); sporocyst L/W ratio, 1. 11 ± 0. 11 (1. 0 - 1. 5). Stieda, parastieda and substieda bodies absent. Phylogenetic analysis of 18 S rRNA sequences indicated that E. tiliquae n. sp. shared 96. 4 - 96. 5 % genetic similarity to E. tropidura, its closest relative. Reptile-derived sequences {{were not available}} for the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene (COI) and phylogenetic analysis at this locus placed E. tiliquae n. sp. in a clade by itself but grouping closest (92 % similarity) with a novel isolate from a King's skink (Egernia kingii) from Western Australia. Based on morphological and molecular data, this isolate is a new species of coccidian parasite that to date has only been found in shingleback skinks...|$|E
40|$|An Eimeria {{species is}} {{described}} from a domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica). Sporulated oocysts (n = 35) were subspherical, {{with a smooth}} bi-layered oocyst wall (1. 0 μm thick). Oocysts measured 20. 2 × 16. 1 (22. 0 – 18. 9 × 15. 7 – 18. 9) μm, oocyst length/width (L/W) ratio, 1. 38. Oocyst residuum and a polar granule were present. The micropyle was absent. Sporocysts are elongate-ovoid, 13. 0 × 6. 1 (14. 5 – 12. 5 × 5. 5 – 7. 0) μm, sporocyst L/W ratio, 2. 13 (2. 0 – 2. 2), sporocyst residuum was present, composed of numerous granules in a spherical or ovoid mass. Each sporocyst contained 2 banana-shaped sporozoites, 12. 3 × 3. 5 (11. 8 – 13. 0 × 3. 3 – 3. 6) μm. A spherical-ellipsoid posterior refractile {{body was found in}} the sporozoites. A nucleus was located immediately anterior to the posterior refractile body. Molecular analysis was conducted at three loci; the 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA genes and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene (COI). At the 18 S locus, the new isolate shared 98. 0 % genetic similarity with three Isospora isolates from Japan from the domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica). At the 28 S locus, it grouped separately and shared 92. 4 % and 92. 5 % genetic similarity with Isospora anthochaerae (KF 766053) from a red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata) from Australia and an Isospora sp. (MS- 2003 – AY 283845) from a Himalayan grey-headed bullfinch (Pyrrhula erythaca) respectively. At COI locus, this new isolate was in a separate clade and shared 95. 6 % and 90. 0 % similarity respectively with Eimeria tiliquae n. sp. from a <b>shingleback</b> <b>skink</b> in Australia and an Eimeria sp. from a common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) from America. Based on the morphological data, this isolate is most similar to Eimeria labbeana. As no molecular data for E. labbeana is available and previous morphological data is incomplete, we refer to the current isolate as E. labbeana-like...|$|E
