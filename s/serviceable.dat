5|$|The average {{operational}} {{sortie rate}} of one per <b>serviceable</b> fighter was not spread evenly throughout the command, however. Nos 12 and 13 Groups in the Midlands and north of Britain, with {{a third of the}} <b>serviceable</b> fighters between them, put up 129 (or only 15 per cent) of the day sorties, and of these only three made contact with the enemy. No. 11 Group put up one-third of the <b>serviceable</b> fighters in 600 sorties, or {{more than two-thirds of the}} total; on average. Each of the <b>serviceable</b> Spitfires and Hurricanes flew 1.7 operational sorties. No. 43 squadron flew the most sorties: 63 operations including five each from the 13 <b>serviceable</b> at the beginning of the day.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{air strikes}} over Belgian air space {{were to be}} {{conducted}} by IV. Fliegerkorps under General der Flieger Generaloberst Alfred Keller. Keller's force consisted of Lehrgeschwader 1 (Stab. I., II., III., IV.), Kampfgeschwader 30 (Stab. I., II., III.) and Kampfgeschwader 27 (III.). On 10 May Keller had 363 aircraft (224 <b>serviceable)</b> augmented by Generalmajor Wolfram von Richthofen's VIII. Fliegerkorps with 550 (420 <b>serviceable)</b> aircraft. They in turn were supported by Oberst Kurt-Bertram von Döring's Jagdfliegerführer 2, with 462 fighters (313 <b>serviceable).</b>|$|E
5|$|German {{intelligence}} {{suggested that}} the RAF was down to just 300 <b>serviceable</b> fighters on 17 August 1940, taking into consideration German pilots' claims and their estimates of British production capabilities. In fact, there were 855 machines <b>serviceable,</b> with another 289 at storage units and 84 at training units. These resources were included {{in a total of}} 1,438 fighters, twice as many as at the beginning of July 1940. Expecting weakening opposition, the Luftwaffe prepared for a major action against RAF Sector Stations on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|Following the German Invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, {{the heavy}} losses of front-line {{aircraft}} endured by the VVS {{together with the}} disruption of aircraft production resulted in I-5s being removed from training units and returned to combat service as ground-attack aircraft or night bombers until early 1942. Some I-5s were used by the 605th and 606th Fighter Regiments (Istrebitel'nyye Aviatsionyye Polki (IAP)) during the defence of Moscow as night bombers until re-equipping in February 1942. The 2nd Ground Attack Regiment (Shturmovoy Aviatsionyye Polki (ShAP)) was raised in September 1941 in the Crimea from reservists and the Kachin Flying School. By 10 October thirty-two I-5s were on hand, although attrition had reduced them to sixteen <b>serviceable.</b> They were down {{to a total of}} a dozen aircraft by 18 October. They served until 1 February 1942 when the regiment was withdrawn for conversion to Ilyushin Il-2s and redesignated as the 766th ShAP. The 11th ShAP was raised by the Air Force of the Black Sea Fleet on 22 September 1941. On 18 October it mustered eighteen <b>serviceable</b> and fifteen unserviceable I-5s, although this was reduced to eleven <b>serviceable</b> and eight unserviceable aircraft by 7 November. It kept the I-5s in service until 1 February 1942 when the regiment was reorganized.|$|E

5|$|White and {{his company}} saw combat from early 1864 through the early 1865. During the summer of 1865 alone, White's company participated in 56 battles and skirmishes, {{including}} picket fights, with two men killed, 26 men wounded (four of which later {{died as a result}} of their wounds), and ten men taken prisoner. By October 1, 1864, White's company had 15 <b>serviceable</b> horses and 70 that were not <b>serviceable.</b> Between 1863 and 1865, White received one severe wound (from June 21, 1864) and two minor wounds from various campaigns. White felt the effects of these wounds for the remainder of his life. Throughout his military service during the American Civil War, White served under the commands of Stonewall Jackson and Jubal Early.|$|E
5|$|By 1950, the {{occupation}} of Japan was winding down, but MacArthur remained in the country as Commander-in-Chief Far East (CINCFE), a post {{to which he had}} been appointed by Truman in 1945. MacArthur had to deal with deep cuts in the defense budget that saw his troop numbers decline from 300,000 in 1947 to 142,000 in 1948. Despite his protests, further reductions had followed and, by June 1950, there were only 108,000 troops in his Far East Command. Cuts in funds and personnel produced shortages of <b>serviceable</b> equipment. Of the Far East Command's 18,000 jeeps, 10,000 were unserviceable; of its 113,870 2½-ton 6x6 trucks, only 4,441 were <b>serviceable.</b> On the positive side, the Far East Command initiated a program of reclaiming and refurbishing war materiel from abandoned stocks throughout the Pacific. This had not only recovered a great deal of valuable stores and equipment, it had also generated a useful repair and rebuilding industry in Japan. Meanwhile, the shift away from occupation duties had permitted a greater focus on training for combat.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{had nearly}} surpassed his friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt's score of 59 {{victories}} in just five weeks. However, the massive material {{superiority of the}} Allies meant the strain placed on the outnumbered German pilots was now severe. At this time, the strength of German fighter units was 112 (65 <b>serviceable)</b> aircraft against the British muster of some 800 machines.|$|E
5|$|Night-flying {{training}} commenced at No.5 EFTS in July 1941. As of 30April 1942, the school's {{strength was}} 845 personnel, including 319 students, the increase owing to {{an influx of}} staff and students from No.2 EFTS and No.6 Elementary Flying Training School in Tamworth, New South Wales, both {{of which had been}} disbanded in March. By July 1943, total strength stood at 748, including thirty-three members of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF); the unit was operating eighty-seven Tiger Moths and one Ryan. In April 1944, WAAAF numbers reached eighty-four out of a total strength of 703; the aircraft complement was eighty-six Tiger Moths, seventy-one of which were <b>serviceable,</b> and two CAC Wacketts, neither <b>serviceable.</b> No.48 Course passed out on 15June 1944, after which training at the school ceased. Three other courses then under way were completed at other EFTSs. By 25June, all of the school's Tiger Moths had been transferred to other locations. A total of 3,734 students had passed through No.5 EFTS, 2,850 of whom graduated as pilots.|$|E
5|$|She was wrecked on 26 February 1852, while {{transporting}} {{troops to}} Algoa Bay at Danger Point near Gansbaai, 87 miles (140 kilometres) from Cape Town, South Africa. There {{were not enough}} <b>serviceable</b> lifeboats for all the passengers, and the soldiers famously stood firm on board, thereby allowing {{the women and children}} to board the boats safely and escape the sinking.|$|E
5|$|Attempting to {{list the}} {{equipment}} available to the DRC's land forces is difficult; most figures are unreliable estimates based on known items delivered in the past. The IISS's Military Balance 2007 and Orbat.com's Concise World Armies 2005 give only slightly differing figures however (the figures below are from the IISS Military Balance 2007). Much of the Army's equipment is non-operational due to insufficient maintenance—in 2002 only 20 percent of the Army's armoured vehicles were estimated as being <b>serviceable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jun'yō was torpedoed in November 1943 {{and spent}} three months under repair. She was damaged by several bombs during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944, but quickly {{returned}} to service. Lacking aircraft, {{she was used}} as a transport in late 1944 and was torpedoed again in December. Jun'yō was under repair until March 1945, when work was cancelled as uneconomical. She was then effectively hulked {{for the rest of the}} war. After the surrender of Japan in September, the Americans also decided that she was not worth the cost to make her <b>serviceable</b> for use as a repatriation ship, and she was broken up in 1946–1947.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August, Admiral Scheer {{attempted}} {{a repeat of}} the 31 May operation; the two <b>serviceable</b> German battlecruisers— and —supported by three dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including Kaiser, would trail behind and provide cover. The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Admiral Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just eleven weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.|$|E
5|$|Six IK-3s were <b>serviceable</b> {{when the}} Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941. All six were in service with the 51st Independent Fighter Group at Zemun near the capital, Belgrade. Pilots flying the IK-3 {{claimed to have}} shot down 11 aircraft during the 11-day conflict. According to one account, {{to prevent them from}} falling into German hands, the surviving aircraft and incomplete airframes were destroyed by their crews and factory staff. Another account indicates that one aircraft survived the invasion but it was later destroyed through sabotage. The IK-3 design was used {{as the basis for the}} post-war Yugoslav-built Ikarus S-49 fighter.|$|E
5|$|The German forces {{involved}} in the Battle of Prokhorovka were from the three Waffen-SS divisions of the II SS-Panzer Corps: Leibstandarte, Das Reich, and Totenkopf. On the evening of 11 July, the <b>serviceable</b> armour strength of the II SS-Panzer Corps was 294 tanks and assault guns, which included 15 Tigers. The armoured strength of Leibstandarte, Das Reich, and Totenkopf were 77, 95, and 122 tanks and assault guns respectively. Ten of the Tigers were {{to the north of}} the Psel River with Totenkopf, four were with Leibstandarte, and Das Reich had just one.|$|E
5|$|The Germans had not {{achieved}} {{a degree of}} success commensurate with their exertions. Nevertheless, in the belief they were having considerable effect on Fighter Command, they prepared to launch their all-out assault on the RAF the following day. By 12 August, German air strength had reached acceptable levels. After bringing its <b>serviceable</b> rates up, the Luftwaffe began Adlertag with 71 percent of its bomber force, 85 percent of its Bf 109 units, and 83 percent of its Bf 110 units operational.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe was to {{spearhead}} {{the aerial}} {{battle in the}} low countries. Its first task was {{the elimination of the}} Belgian air contingent. Despite an overwhelming numerical superiority of 1,375 aircraft, 957 of which were <b>serviceable,</b> the air campaign in Belgium had limited success overall on the first day. At roughly 04:00, the first air raids were conducted against airfields and communication centres. It still had a tremendous impact on the AéMI, which had only 179 aircraft on 10 May.|$|E
5|$|The closest large German unit to {{the canal}} bridge was the 2nd Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment based at Cairon. General Feuchtinger {{ordered them to}} {{recapture}} the bridges, and then attack the parachute landing zones further west. At 02:00, the 2nd Battalion headed for the bridges from the west, supported by the 1st Panzerjager Company {{and part of the}} 989th Heavy Artillery Battalion coming from the north. As the first Panzer IVs from the north reached the junction leading to the bridge, the leading vehicle was hit by a round from 'D' Company's only <b>serviceable</b> PIAT anti-tank weapon. The vehicle exploded, setting off its stowed ammunition, and the other tanks withdrew.|$|E
5|$|The gross {{underestimation}} of Fighter Command's strength {{issued to}} Luftwaffe units meant the British reaction was {{much stronger than}} expected. During the 24-hour period, Fighter Command flew 927 sorties, slightly fewer than the Germans. Only 41 of these sorties were flown by night, 28 on 17/18 August and 13 on 18/19 August. The remaining 886 sorties were flown by day, a number almost exactly equal to the 861 <b>serviceable</b> Spitfire, Hurricane, Defiant and Gladiator day fighters available to squadrons.|$|E
5|$|A {{company of}} R-2s was {{assigned}} to the Popescu Armoured Detachment after King Michael's Coup and Romanian's defection from the Axis at the end of August 1944. The Detachment was tasked with preventing the German units stationed around Ploiești from breaking out to the north and finding refuge in Hungary. They accomplished their task and the R-2s were withdrawn from combat operations until the following year. Romania had concentrated all of its remaining tanks and armoured fighting vehicles in the 2nd Armoured Regiment in early 1945 as the unofficial Soviet arms embargo began to have effect. It had five R-2s on hand in early February 1945 when it was sent to the front, but the Soviets confiscated most of them when it arrived. Both R-2s were <b>serviceable</b> when the regiment entered Bratislava on 4 April 1945, but these were probably destroyed when the regiment was virtually surrounded in Austria on 10 April because they are no longer listed among the regiment's vehicles afterwards.|$|E
5|$|A {{second wave}} of German {{aircraft}} arrived over Belgrade at 10:00 and the remaining IK-3s were scrambled {{with the rest of}} the 51st Fighter Group but the IK-3 pilots claimed no victories. A joint claim was made during the third German attack at 14:00, a twin-engined bomber by Gogić and another pilot from the 162nd Fighter Squadron. The following day, the IK-3 pilots made five or six sorties against German bomber formations and their fighter escorts and claimed three bombers between them. At 17:00, Milislav Semiz attacked a tight formation of three bombers; his aircraft received 56 hits from return fire, 20 of which were in the engine and propeller, but managed to land the aircraft. The return of another IK-3 from the workshops meant that the number of <b>serviceable</b> IK-3s remained at three.|$|E
5|$|Archival {{data of the}} II SS-Panzer Corps {{shows that}} the corps had 294 {{operable}} tanks and assault guns {{on the evening of}} 11 July, and 251 on the evening of 13 July. Allowing for the possibility that some repaired tanks were returned to service on 13 July, these numbers indicate that at least 43 tanks and assault guns became inoperable during this period, which includes all ten Tigers belonging to Totenkopf and one belonging to Leibstandarte. An estimated total of 60–80 tanks and assault guns of the II SS-Panzer Corps were damaged or destroyed in combat on 12 July. By the end of 16 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps had 292 <b>serviceable</b> tanks and assault guns, almost the same number it had {{at the beginning of the}} battle on 12 July. On 12 July, Schlachtgeschwader 1 of the 8th Air Corps and its attached squadron of Stukas reported 11 aircraft damaged, all by Soviet anti-aircraft artillery, of which 6 were total write-offs.|$|E
5|$|As for {{the battle}} losses, sources vary. The Flemish Protestant Guillaume Baudart set Dutch losses at 88 horses, 83 prisoners and 24 killed. The Italian Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio claimed {{that more than}} 300 Dutch {{soldiers}} were slain as opposed to about 60 Spanish casualties. The Roman Jesuit Angelo Gallucci also wrote of 300 Dutch casualties. The Spanish soldier and writer Carlos Coloma set the Spanish loss as 19 men killed and claimed that the Dutch force lost three flags and about 400 <b>serviceable</b> horses. On the Spanish side the only soldiers of note among the casualties were Caraffa, Martinengo and Caracciolo, {{all of whom were}} wounded, but not mortally. Joseph de La Pise stated that the Dutch took seven Spanish prisoners and 15 horses. According to Antonio Carnero, accountant in the Spanish army, an envoy of the King of France to the Dutch camp was present at the battle and found later among the fatalities.|$|E
5|$|As {{microwave}} systems entered service, {{along with}} updated versions of aircraft carrying them, the problem arose {{of what to}} do with those aircraft carrying Mk. IV that were otherwise <b>serviceable.</b> One possibility, suggested as early as 1942, was homing in on the Luftwaffe's own radar sets. The basic operational frequencies of the Luftwaffes counterpart to the Mk. IV, the FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC radar, had been discovered in December 1942. On 3 April 1943 the Air Interception Committee ordered the TRE to begin considering the homing concept under the codename Serrate. As luck would have it, this proved to be perfect timing. In the late afternoon of 9 May 1943, a crew from IV/NJG.3 defected to the UK by flying their fully equipped Ju 88R-1 night fighter, D5+EV, to RAF Dyce in Scotland, giving the TRE their first direct look at the Lichtenstein.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 1943 Germany's armored forces had {{sustained}} heavy casualties. It was unusual for a Panzer Division to field more than 100 tanks, and most averaged only 70–80 <b>serviceable</b> tanks at any given time. After the fighting around Kharkov, Heinz Guderian embarked on a program to bring Germany's mechanized forces up to strength. Despite his efforts, a German panzer division could only count on an estimated 10,000–11,000 personnel, out of an authorized strength of 13,000–17,000. Only by June did a panzer division begin to field between 100–130 tanks each. SS divisions were normally in better shape, with an estimated 150 tanks, a battalion of self-propelled assault guns and enough half-tracks to motorize most of its infantry and reconnaissance soldiers—and these had an authorized strength of an estimated 19,000 personnel. At this time, the bulk of Germany's armor was still composed of Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs, although the 2nd SS Panzer Division had been outfitted {{with a number of}} Tiger I tanks.|$|E
5|$|During 18 August 1940, Luftwaffe units flew a {{total of}} 970 sorties over Britain: some 495 by medium bombers, 460 by fighters and 15 by {{reconnaissance}} units. Of this total, about 170 of the bomber sorties were flown {{on the night of}} 17/18 August; the remainder were flown during the daylight hours on 18 August. Less than half of the available (or <b>serviceable)</b> aircraft on the Luftflotte 2 and Luftflotte 3 order of battle were involved in the action that day, so {{it was clear that the}} Luftwaffe was not greatly extended in providing forces for the offensive. Luftflotte 5 did not take any part in the fighting, although its reconnaissance aircraft were active over England and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|For his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{turned to}} a question that was to shape his lifetime research. He sought exact solutions of Einstein's equations: model universes consistent with the laws of general relativity that are simple enough to allow for an explicit description in terms of basic mathematical expressions. These exact solutions {{play a key role}} when it comes to building general-relativistic models of physical situations. However, general relativity is a fully covariant theory – its laws are the same, independent of which coordinates are chosen to describe a given situation. One direct consequence is that two apparently different exact solutions could correspond to the same model universe, and differ only in their coordinates. Ehlers began to look for <b>serviceable</b> ways of characterizing exact solutions invariantly, that is, in ways that do not depend on coordinate choice. In order to do so, he examined ways of describing the intrinsic geometric properties of the known exact solutions.|$|E
5|$|Göring (who {{controlled}} Rheinmetall-Borsig) supplied {{arms to the}} Republicans; {{shipped to}} Greece supposedly for their use, the arms were transferred by Bodosakis to ships supposedly sailing to Mexico. He was also supplying the Nationalists, who got the best and latest weapons while the Republicans got the oldest and least <b>serviceable.</b> This supply peaked in 1937–38. Nationalists identified 18 vessels to Republican ports from 3 January 1937 and 11 May 1938, and estimated that Goering received the equivalent of one pound sterling per rifle. An earlier shipment from Hamburg to Alicante on 1 October 1936 by the Welsh ship Bramhill had 19,000 rifles, 101 machine guns and more than 20 million cartridges for the CNT militia in Barcelona. Nazi Germany also helped the propaganda war with a gift of a Telefunken transmitter for the newly created national radio service.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942 the Royal Marines were tasked to organise Commando {{units of}} their own. In total nine Commando units were {{formed by the}} Royal Marines: No. 40, No. 41, No. 42, No. 43, No. 44, No. 45, No. 46, No. 47 and the last, No. 48, which was only formed in 1944. In 1943 two other Commando units were formed. The first was the Royal Naval Commandos, who were {{established}} to carry out tasks associated with establishing, maintaining, and controlling beachheads during amphibious operations. The other was the Royal Air Force Commandos, who would accompany an invasion force either to make enemy airfields <b>serviceable,</b> or to make new airstrips operational and contribute to their defence.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, when Nigeria Airways had a Boeing 737-200 as its sole <b>serviceable</b> aircraft, the {{government}} {{decided not to}} pump more money into the overstaffed carrier but to liquidate it. The decision {{was based on the}} declining performance of the airline's last 15 years of operations and on the carrier's debts. The number of carried passengers had fallen from 2,1million in 1985 to just 10,000 {{in the first quarter of}} 2003, and it controlled just 6% and 1% of the domestic and the international markets, respectively. The carrier owed over million, despite {{the government}} having injected million into the company in its last decade of operations. The airline ceased operations in 2003 and was liquidated a year later. The Nigerian government later came to an agreement with Virgin Atlantic Airways to found Virgin Nigeria Airways, intended as a replacement. Even though Virgin Nigeria suceeded Nigeria Airways, the ground facilities of the folded Nigeria Airways were eventually taken over by the then-startup carrier Arik Air.|$|E

5|$|In {{its first}} year of service, an IK-3 was lost {{when one of the}} {{squadron}} commanders, Kapetan Anton Ercigoj, was making a mock attack on a Potez 25 over the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers. After passing below the Potez, he went into a climb with the intention of performing a loop. His rate of climb was too steep and the aircraft fell into a spin at low altitude and hit the water. Before the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in early April 1941, the 51st Fighter Group was placed under the 6th Fighter Regiment, which was responsible for the defence of Belgrade. The 51st Fighter Group was further reinforced the day before the invasion began, with the 102nd Fighter Squadron equipped with Bf 109Es. When the invasion began on 6 April, the two IK-3 squadrons had only three <b>serviceable</b> aircraft each.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 1916, Admiral Scheer {{attempted}} {{a repeat of}} the 31 May operation.
