40|$|Corn (Zea mays) is {{produced}} throughout California as fresh <b>sweet</b> <b>corn,</b> <b>silage</b> corn, and grain. In 2005, California produced 25, 000 acres (10, 100 ha) of sweet corn, 440, 000 acres (178, 000 ha) of silage corn, and 100, 000 acres (40, 500 ha) of grain. The worth of each was $ 109 million, $ 300 million, and $ 52 million, respectively, {{for an annual}} total state value of $ 500 million (NASS 2006). People consume approxi-mately 18 % of the total corn produced in California, with the rest being eaten by animals, mainly dairy cows. California is a net importer of corn, with much of this additional grain coming from the midwestern states to feed animals in large poultry houses, cattle feedlots, and {{to be used in}} flour mills. Does cross-pollination occur in corn? Unlike all other major grain crops such as wheat, rice, and barley, the corn plant has separate male and female flowering parts. The tassel and the ear are the male and female flowering structures, respectively. During the flowering stage, pollen shed and silking are necessary aspects of generating the next generation of seeds. Because of the separation of the male and female parts, cross-pollination of corn plants occur...|$|E
40|$|The {{springs and}} the Suwannee river of {{northern}} Florida in Middle Suwanee River Basin (MSRB) are among several examples in this planet that {{have shown a}} temporal trend of increasing nitrate concentration primarily due to the impacts of non-point sources such as agriculture. The rate of nitrate increase in the river as documented by Ham and Hatzell (1996) was 0. 02 mg N L- 1 y- 1. Best management practices (BMPs) for nutrients were adopted by the commercial farms in the MSRB region to reduce the amounts of pollutants entering the water bodies, however the effectiveness of BMPs remains a topic of interest and discussion among the researchers, environmental administrators and policy makers about the loads of nitrogen entering into groundwater and river systems. Through this study, an initiative was taken to estimate nitrogen losses into the environment from commercial production systems of row and vegetable crops that had adopted BMPs and were under a presumption of compliance with state water quality standards. Nitrogen mass budget was constructed by quantifying the N sources and sinks for three crops (potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), <b>sweet</b> <b>corn</b> (Zea mays L.) and <b>silage</b> <b>corn</b> (Zea mays L.)) over a four year period (2010 - 2013) on a large representative commercial farm in northern Florida. Fertilizer N {{was found to be}} the primary N input and represented 98. 0 ± 1. 4, 91. 0 ± 13. 9, 78. 0 ± 17. 3 % of the total N input for potato, <b>sweet</b> <b>corn,</b> and <b>silage</b> <b>corn,</b> respectively. Average crop N uptake represented 55. 5 %, 60. 5 %, and 65. 2 % of the mean total input N whereas average mineral N left in top 0. 3 m soil layer at harvest represented 9. 1 %, 4. 5 %, and 2. 6 % of the mean total input N.

Feeding <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> allows cattle feeders {{to take advantage}} of the entire corn plant at a time of maximum quality and tonnage as well as secure substantial quantities of roughage and grain inventory. Distiller’s grains have proven to be economical and are now a commonplace ingredient in feedlot finishing diets. Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of feeding increased concentrations of <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> in replacement of corn grain in finishing diets containing distillers grains. Feedlot gains and gain:feed ratios were reduced as <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> increased in the diet. Total tract dry matter digestibility of diets containing 45 % <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> was decreased compared to diets containing 15 % <b>corn</b> <b>silage.</b> Although total tract neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration was not different across <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> inclusions, in-situ NDF disappearance of corn bran was greater for diets with increased <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> inclusion. Whole <b>corn</b> plants were sampled and analyzed for two consecutive years for determination of the effects on whole corn plant yield and quality measurements due to hybrid season length, planting density, and whole plant harvest timing. As whole plants were harvested later in the season, yield increased with minimal changes in whole plant quality measures. The economic factors involved in pricing <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> were assessed, and different economic scenarios were developed for feeding <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> in finishing diets containing distillers grains. Feeding increased concentrations of <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> in finishing diets containing distillers grains was determined economical when corn grain price was above $ 163. 38 per metric tonne.

To achieve this, the author conducted three analyses to determine if there was a significant difference between the two <b>corn</b> <b>silages.</b> First, in vitro digestibility tests were taken to examine the difference in digestibility between the two <b>corn</b> <b>silages.</b> After 30 hours of in vitro testing, digestibility was markedly higher in the Brown Midrib <b>Corn</b> <b>Silage</b> (69...|$|R
40|$|High quality <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> {{contributes}} {{greatly to}} supplying the energy, starch and forage {{neutral detergent fiber}} needs of high-producing dairy cows, reducing purchased feed costs from expensive grain and byproduct supplements, and generating milk revenue for dairy producers. Transgenic corn hybrids have become common for <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> production, and extensive research does not suggest any cause for concern about feeding <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> produced from genetically modified seed corn when the traits make agronomic and economic sense to the grower. Commercial transgenic corn hybrids specific for improving the nutritional quality and feeding value of <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> are not available, but in the future could enhance progress for improving the digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and potentially circumvent major nutritional limitations to the feeding of high <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> diets to dairy cows. Results from a meta-analysis indicate that starch digestibility and lactation performance were reduced for dairy cows fed diets containing <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> with> 40 % dry matter or <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> with insufficient kernel processing. Kernel processing <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> to improve starch digestibility was effective across {{a wide range of}} dry matter contents and theoretical lengths of cut, but did not overcome adverse effects of very high dry matter content on total-tract starch digestibility and was ineffective at very long theoretical lengths of cut.

The treatments were as follows by concentrate containing protein at 14 % CP + 2 % urea-treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> (T 1); concentrate containing protein at 14 % CP + 5 % urea-treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> (T 2); concentrate containing protein at 18 % CP + 2 % urea-treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> (T 3) and concentrate containing protein at 18 % CP + 5 % urea-treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> (T 4), respectively. The animals were offered the treatment concentrate at a ratio to milk yields at 1 : 2 and urea-treated <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> were fed ad libitum. The results have revealed that total DM intake (%BW) and ruminal pH were not affected (p> 0. 05).

40|$|Corn is a {{versatile}} crop {{that can be}} planted from early to late spring. In the fall, producers {{have the option of}} harvesting <b>corn</b> for either <b>silage</b> or grain. <b>Corn</b> <b>silage</b> is an important source of forage, and many producers are reevaluating cropping systems and increasing use of <b>corn</b> <b>silage.</b> <b>Corn</b> can produce high dry matter yields with one harvest. Corn is a good crop to recycle nutrients from manure and maintain water quality. <b>Corn</b> <b>silage</b> is easily ensiled and generally results in palatable forage with relatively consistent quality and higher energy content than other forages. <b>Corn</b> <b>silage</b> production requires less labor and machinery time than other harvested forages. Thus, the cost per ton of dry matter produced tends to be lower for <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> than for other forages. Offsetting these benefits of <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> are some disadvantages relative to other forages. There are few established markets and transportation costs are high, so the crop must be fed on or near the farm where it is produced. In some locations, where corn is not well adapted, production costs may be too high to warrant silage production. On erodible soils, <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> production may be limited because of soil residue requirements for conservation compliance...|$|R

40|$|Whole-plant silage from intercropped {{grain sorghum}} and Williams 82 soybean was {{compared}} to <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> in a mixed diet for mid-lactation dairy cows. Cows fed the grain sorghum-soybean silage yielded 45. 13 lb and those fed <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> yielded 44. 05 lb of fat (4 %) -corrected milk daily. Milk yield, milk fat, and milk lactose percentages were similar between cows fed the two silages.

40|$|In this study, two fresh culture multistrains were {{produced}} and tested on corn silage; homofermentative and hetrofermentative from commercially and laboratory produced inoculants. Chemical properties {{and characteristics of}} silage samples were determined in mini- silos for 7, 14, 28, 45 and 90 days (triplicate per treatment). In situ ruminal degradability of DM and CP and in vitro gas production of fresh forage and silage (45 and 90 day silage) were investigated. There were differences between treatments for DM, OM, CP and Ash contents. Residual WSC and CP contents decreased and the concentration of NH 3 -N increased with time post ensiling. <b>Corn</b> <b>silage</b> inoculated with the homofermentative inoculant had the lowest pH in all ensiling times except that of 28 days.

Rated <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> derived from two habitats. The first habitat was Senice in Hané and the second Záblatí. These silages were compared with samples from Žabčice municipality. A statistically significant difference was proven in the digestibility of organic matter in different habitats. Highest organic matter digestibility in <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> was from Záblatí. <b>Corn</b> <b>silage</b> from Žabčice municipality had the lowest digestibility of organic matter. Among the evaluated habitat was {{a statistically significant difference}} in the content of individual nutrients. The fat content was greatest for <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> from Senice in Hané. The station in Záblatí was measured volume of fiber, ADF, NDF and BNLV. The use of silage additives had no statistically significant effect on organic matter digestibility of <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> or the content of individual nutrients.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the chop length of <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> on feed intake, milk yield, fertility and the incidence of certain diseases is discussed controversially. In this study, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} chop length of <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> has an influence on ruminal fermentation processes, creating a ruminal acidosis and therefore having a negative effect on the cows health. Over a period of five months, two groups of cows in milk were fed a TMR which differed only in the chop length of the <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> (short <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> = 5 mm, long <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> = 21 mm). 30 cows were fed the short and 29 cows were fed the long <b>corn</b> <b>silage.</b> The data on fertility and the overall health of the cows was taken from the herd management program. Milk yield, feed intake and body weight were measured daily; milk composition was measured every two weeks. Twice a week chewing activity was determined. During the first four weeks blood, urine and rumen fluid samples were taken once a week. After the first four weeks, the samples were taken every four weeks until the 20 th week. Feed intake, milk yield and fertility showed {{no significant differences between the}} two feeding groups. The laboratory evaluations showed significant differences between the groups in several values. The group fed the short <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> showed a more acidotic metabolic status than the group fed the long <b>corn</b> <b>silage.</b> Both groups lay within the reference value. The group fed the short <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> shows a significantly higher frequency of displaced abomasums (33 % versus 6 %) and a higher activity of ASAT than the group fed the long <b>corn</b> <b>silage.</b> At certain times the ASAT values were above the reference value. Therefore, it can be said that the short chop length has a negative influence on the animal health. The results of the ruminal fluid examination show neither significant differences between the two groups nor signs of a ruminal acidosis. Thus, we conclude that the short chopped <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> has a negative affect on the cows. However this is not caused by a ruminal acidosis, but rather by a microbial ruminal dysfunction caused by the lack of effective fiber in the ration with the short <b>corn</b> <b>silage...</b>|$|R
