40|$|In 2010,	 vaccinia	virus	caused	an	outbreak	of	bovine vaccinia that	affected	dairy	cattle	and	rural	workers	in	Pará State,	 Brazil. Genetic	analyses	 identified	 the	virus	as	dis-tinct from	 BeAn 58058 	 vaccinia	 virus	 (identified	 in	 1960 s) and from	 smallpox	 vaccine	 virus	 strains. These	 {{findings}} suggest spread	of	autochthonous	group	 1 	vaccinia	virus	in this region. Over the past decade, several exanthematous vaccinia virus (VACV) outbreaks that affected dairy cattle and rural {{workers have been}} reported in Brazil. During out-breaks, lesions developed on teats and udders of dairy cat-tle and caused a decrease in milk production (1, 2). Infected milkers usually had lesions on their hands; the infection was apparently transmitted by unprotected contact with in-fected cattle (1, 2). Molecular studies have shown that autochthonous VACVs from Brazil (VACV-BR) can be divided into 2 groups: group 1 and group 2 (3, 4). Group 1 includes iso-lates Cantagalo, Araçatuba, Passatempo, Guarani P 2, Mari-ana, and Pelotas 2; group 2 includes isolates Guarani P 1, Pelotas 1, and BeAN 58058 (BAV). This molecular dichot-omy is also reflected in certain biologic properties of the isolates, including virulence in the BALB/c mouse model and plaque phenotype in BSC- 40 cells (1). Although each VACV strain has unique genetic characteristics, most of them are similar to each other within the same group, es-pecially those belonging to group 1; they most likely share a common ancestor. Although some researchers believed that VACV vaccine strains could have <b>spread</b> <b>from</b> <b>humans</b> to domestic animals and adapted to the rural environment (2), recent studies have suggested an independent origin for VACV isolates from South America, which is distinct from vaccine strains used in South America during the World Health Organization vaccination campaign. (3, 4). Despite emergence of VACV in the past decade, VACV was also isolated during the 1960 s and 1970 s dur-ing government efforts to investigate emerging viruses i...|$|E

PayneThe Master of Public Health (MPH) {{capstone}} experience {{results in}} numerous {{personal and academic}} gains. Through my MPH capstone experience, I was able to utilize knowledge gained from previously related classes. I gained exposure {{and understanding of the}} risks and hazards of zoonotic disease research, especially as it relates to attenuated Rift Valley fever virus (MP- 12) in a Biosafety Level (BSL) - 2 Research Facility. I was also able to achieve an understanding of what procedures should be in place to protect the occupational safety of workers in the laboratory or research setting. Finally, in a Frontier trip to the United States-Mexico Border Port of Entry in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, I was able to observe the real life activities, issues, and actions, which occur on a daily basis to protect and defend this nation’s public health and food supply. The risk of foreign animal or zoonotic disease outbreaks are high today and may be rising. The reasons involved include increased international trade and travel, population growth, the changing patterns of human-animal contact, an increased demand for animal protein, increased wealth, environmental changes and human encroachment of farm land and previously undisturbed wildlife habitat. Infectious disease outbreaks can cause human suffering/death and substantial economic losses to the agricultural sectors resulting in disrupted agricultural commodity markets. Zoonotic diseases such as those caused by Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) can <b>spread</b> <b>from</b> <b>humans</b> to animals and vice-versa, raising an additional dimension of vulnerability to human health. Rift Valley fever virus is not considered an immediate risk to the continental United States; however, it is considered a possible threat and, if established, could result in similar consequences as West Nile Virus (WNV) in 1999. Its socioeconomic impact and significant effect on human health and livestock could resemble the economically crippling effect seen in countries, such as those in Africa. This impact is seen in the form of stressed health care services, decreased animal reproduction, and financial loss due to human and animal morbidity and mortality, and national as well as international trade restrictions. Through the understanding of RVFV’s global importance and the application of zoonotic agent laboratory research, I was able to produce two PowerPoint presentations, which will be useful as training exercises for new laboratory workers starting with the Arthropod-Borne Animal Disease Research Unit (ABADRU). Additionally, I was able to participate in the preliminary occupational risk evaluation of an intradermal needle-free injection device, for the potential use in future ABADRU work...|$|E

This research project {{is part of a larger}} project that was developed to gain an understanding of the knowledge and perceptions of Australians about bird flu, to develop and pretest messages (public service ads) that the Australian government could use in the event of a pandemic, and to develop broader communication strategies to produce effective communications and to respond to misinformation that is expected to appear in the public arena.
