40|$|Through {{its central}} homepage, FAO now organises and {{disseminates}} its 40 independent databases on agriculture, fisheries and forestry on internet. This virtual information point is called WAICENT (the World Agriculture Information Centre). The website is basically built around three major components. FAOINFO is {{the gateway to}} multimedia information such as FAO's photo and video archive, and a microfiche-based archive of a large agricultural library and bibliographic databases. The second, FAOSTAT contains data on demography, agriculture, fisheries and forestry for 210 countries and territories. The third component, FAOSIS, covers highly <b>specialised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> It includes the global information and early warning system, which provides up-to-date reports on global crop production, markets and regional and country-by-country situation reports. Another element in FAOSIS is the Emergency Prevention System, which provides data for transboundary animal and plant pests and diseases. The site is viewable in Arabic, English, French and Spanish. As part of FAO's efforts to expand access to WAICENT {{in areas where the}} Internet is not yet available, a portable set of CD-ROMs has been developed.

40|$|The {{application}} of GIS in maritime boundary delimitation: {{a case study}} on the Indonesia-East Timor maritime boundary delimitation The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste (East Timor) attained independence on 20 May 2002, marking its separation from Indonesia.

Technically, potential delimitation lines were calculated in a geodetically robust manner. A literature review has been conducted with regard to the principles of maritime boundary delimitation, research on similar cases of maritime boundaries and papers discussing the decision/judgement in some other proceedings regarding maritime boundary delimitation. Existing research and literature are used to support the arguments provided in this current research. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, LOSC, provides the main legal reference point, along with relevant state practices and jurisprudence. As to the results of this research, it has been identified that three major locations for maritime boundaries are to be delimited. These are in the Ombai Strait, the Wetar Strait and in the Timor Sea. A number of alternative potential boundary alignments have also been examined and analysed for the three locations, in the context of future maritime boundary negotiations between the two States. However, the results are not the final boundaries that Indonesia and East Timor have to accept. Ultimately it is for the governments of Indonesia and East Timor to decide on and negotiate towards an equitable solution that will satisfy both parties.

40|$|The {{information}} {{centre of the}} Emma Children’s Hospital AMC (EKZ AMC) is a <b>specialised</b> <b>information</b> centre where paediatric patients and persons involved with the patient can ask questions about all aspects of disease and its social implications. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the question–answer service of this {{information centre}} in order to determine the role of a <b>specialised</b> <b>information</b> centre in an academic children’s hospital, identify the appropriate resources for the service and potential positive effects. For this purpose, a case management system was developed in MS ACCESS. The characteristics of the requester and the question, the time it took to answer questions, the information sources used and the extent to which we were able to answer the questions were registered. The costs of the service were determined. We analysed all questions that were asked in the year 2007. Fourteen hundred thirty-four questions were asked. Most questions were asked by parents (23. 3 %), healthcare workers (other than nurses; 16. 5 %) and nurses (15. 3 %). The scope of the most frequently asked questions include disease (20. 2 %) and treatment (13. 0 %). Information on paper was the main information source used. Most questions could be solved within 15  min. Twelve percent to 28 % of total working hours are used for the question–answer service. Total costs including staff salary are rather large. In conclusions, taking over the task of providing additional medical information and by providing readily available, good quality information that healthcare professionals can use to inform their patients will lead to less time investment of these more expensive staff members. A <b>specialised</b> <b>information</b> service can anticipate on the information need of parents and persons involved with the paediatric patient. It improves information by providing with relatively simple resources that has the potential to improve patient and parent satisfaction, coping and medical results.

40|$|PRINCIPLE: Healthcare professionals' (HCPs') {{perception}} of risk associated with drug use in pregnancy may {{have an impact on}} the pharmacological treatment of some women. The aim of this study was to examine this risk perception in a sample of Swiss HCPs with a special focus on their knowledge and use of available <b>specialised</b> <b>information</b> sources. METHOD: An online, French and German, questionnaire was e-mailed to 7, 136 members of four Swiss professional societies (gynaecologists, paediatricians, midwives and pharmacists). The questionnaire was designed (a) to collect demographic characteristics, (b) to evaluate the frequency of use of several <b>specialised</b> sources of <b>information</b> on drugs in pregnancy in their daily practice, and (c) to examine the {{perception of}} risk associated with drug use during pregnancy. RESULTS: A total of 1, 310 questionnaires were collected (response rate of 18. 4 %). More than 80 % of the respondent HCPs use the Swiss Drug Reference Book (Compendium) to assess the risk associated with drugs during pregnancy and are not aware of available <b>specialised</b> <b>information</b> sources (books, websites or information centres). Despite some disparities between HPCs, the risk related to drug intake was overall highly misperceived. Blinded reading of three product monographs in the Compendium was associated with an overestimated {{perception of risk}} (e. g., after reading the "paracetamol" monograph, 38 % of the participants stated they would probably not advise the use of this drug to a pregnant patient). CONCLUSION: Overall, an overestimation of the risk associated with drug use during pregnancy has been observed in our sample of HCPs, which might be related to the underuse of <b>specialised</b> <b>information</b> source among other factors. These findings evidenced the need for increased training for HCPs in order to optimise medication use during pregnancy. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and identify causes...|$|R
