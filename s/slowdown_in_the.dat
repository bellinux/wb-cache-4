5|$|The U.S. Savings and Loan {{crisis of}} the 1980s and early 1990s was the failure of 747 savings and loan {{associations}} (S) in the United States. The ultimate cost of the crisis is estimated to have totaled around $160.1 billion, about $124.6 billion of which was directly {{paid for by the}} U.S. federal government. The accompanying <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> finance industry and the real estate market may have been a contributing cause of the 1990-1991 economic recession.

We then test for a structural change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growth rates for each group and also attempt to identify the change point for each group. If {{there is a significant}} change, then the growth rates are estimated before and after the break for comparison.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{have studied the}} {{influence}} of the vector register size over two different concepts of vector architectures. We have observed that, long vector registers {{play an important role in}} a conventional vector architecture. However, we observed that even using highly vectorizable codes, only a small fraction of that large vector registers is used. Nevertheless, we have observed that, reducing vector register size on a conventional vector architecture, result in a severe performance degradation, providing <b>slowdowns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range of 1. 8 to 3. 8. When we including an out-of-order execution on a vector architecture, the necessity of long vector registers, is reduced. We have used a trace driven approach to simulate a selection of the Perfect Club and Specfp 92 programs. The results of the simulations show that, the register size reduction on an outof -order vector architecture is less negative than in a conventional vector machine, providing <b>slowdowns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range of 1. 0 [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The {{decisive factor}} {{in favour of}} change in Chicago, however, was the {{economic}} <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1890s, which {{gave way to the}} financial panic of 1893. The recession, combined with the frantic building of the previous few years, meant that Chicago suddenly had a significant surplus of office space, threatening occupancy levels and rents. Regulation was introduced by the city council to control the problem in 1892, with support from the real estate industry who hoped to slow the construction of additional office space and shore up their diminishing profit margins. The height of new buildings was limited to , with lower height levels on narrower streets, effectively curtailing the construction of any taller skyscrapers.|$|E

40|$|In Italy, as in {{many other}} countries, the years {{immediately}} after 1929 were characterized by a major <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> economic activity.

30|$|Sharp {{fluctuations}} {{in oil prices}} are generally seen as {{a major contributor to}} business cycle asymmetries. Historical highs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world oil market created concerns about possible <b>slowdowns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> economic performance of the most developed countries. Most recently, declines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world oil price caused oil exporting countries such as Russia and Nigeria to cut their national budgets. Thus, not surprisingly, a considerable body of economic research studies the channels through which oil price shocks influence economic variables for oil-importing, oil-exporting, developed, and emerging economies.|$|R

The pointed-arch windows and Gothic tracery suggest the possible influence of Andrew Jackson Downing's architectural theories.|$|E
25|$|The {{optimism}} {{of the first}} decade {{was accompanied by a}} growing sense of inequality among many Afro-Jamaicans, and a concern that the benefits of growth were not being shared by the urban poor. Combined with the effects of a <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> global economy in 1970, the voters elected the PNP (People's National Party) in 1972. They tried to implement more socially equitable policies in education and health, but the economy suffered under their leadership. By 1980, Jamaica's gross national product had declined to some 25% below the 1972 level. Due to rising foreign and local debt, accompanied by large fiscal deficits, the government sought International Monetary Fund (IMF) financing from the United States and others.|$|E
25|$|The {{pandemic}} outbreak of influenza {{in the spring}} of 1918, along with a major economic <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> postwar period, hit Spain particularly hard, and the country went into debt. From that moment the social conflict was to come to a head. The post-World War I economic difficulties heightened social unrest among urban industrial workers and rural peasants, with a period of strikes and agitation in both the city and the countryside. The Cortes (Spanish parliament) under the constitutional monarchy seemed to have no solution to Spain's unemployment, labor strikes, and poverty. The socialists and anarchists pressed for radical changes, but the government proved unable to reform itself or the nation and frustration mounted.|$|E

25|$|Italy {{has been}} hit hard by the Financial crisis of 2007–08, that {{exacerbated}} the country's structural problems. Effectively, after a strong GDP growth of 5–6% per year from the 1950s to the early 1970s, and a progressive <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980-90s, the country virtually stagnated in the 2000s. The political efforts to revive growth with massive government spending eventually produced a severe rise in public debt, that stood at over 135% of GDP in 2014, ranking second in the EU only after the Greek one (at 174%). For all that, the largest chunk of Italian public debt is owned by national subjects, a major difference between Italy and Greece, {{and the level of}} household debt is much lower than the OECD average.|$|E

The average level of real assets (US$319,700) was the second {{highest in the world}} after Norway and 60% of gross household assets. The report explained that this partly reflects a large endowment of land and natural resources relative to population, and also high urban real estate prices. Only 6% of Australians had net worth below US$10,000, compared to 29% in the USA and 70% for the world as a whole. The average debt was 20% of gross assets. The proportion of people with wealth above US$100,000 was {{the highest in the world}} (eight times the world average). Australia had 3.8% (1,783,000 people) of the top 1% of global wealth holders while having 0.4% of the world’s adult population. The wealth share by Australia's top decile was 51.1% in 2000, 50.7% in 2007, and 51.1% in 2014. In 2016, Australia continued to be the second wealthiest nation in terms of wealth per adult.|$|E
25|$|Sweden {{has had an}} {{economic}} model in the post-World War II era, characterized by close cooperation between the government, labour unions, and corporations. The Swedish economy has extensive and universal social benefits funded by high taxes, close to 50% of GDP. In the 1980s, a real estate and financial bubble formed, driven by a rapid increase in lending. A restructuring of the tax system, in order to emphasize low inflation combined with an international economic <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1990s, caused the bubble to burst. Between 1990 and 1993 GDP went down by 5% and unemployment skyrocketed, causing the worst economic crisis in Sweden since the 1930s. According to an analysis published in Computer Sweden in 1992, the investment level decreased drastically for information technology and computing equipment, except in the financial and banking sector, {{the part of the}} industry that created the crisis. The investment levels for IT and computers were restored as early as 1993. In 1992 there was a run on the currency, the central bank briefly jacking up interest to 500% in an unsuccessful effort to defend the currency's fixed exchange rate. Total employment fell by almost 10% during the crisis.|$|E

Several economies within China’s supply chain are increasingly exposed to its investment-led growth and face growing risks from a deceleration in investment in China. This note quantifies potential global spillovers from an investment <b>slowdown</b> <b>in</b> China.
