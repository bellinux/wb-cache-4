In 1987 Malvern gained official EU status as a natural mineral water, a mark of purity and quality.

This study traces particulate matter on a basin scale by characterizing the chemical composition (POC and PN concentrations, POC/PN mass ratios, δ 13 C and δ 15 N) of <b>suspended</b> particulate <b>matter</b> in Lake Erie, three tributary inflows, and the lake outflow between May and October, 2002. The data are used to 1) determine the relative contributions of allochthonous and autochthonous sources to <b>suspended</b> particulate <b>matter,</b> 2) identify possible sources of <b>suspended</b> particulate <b>matter,</b> and 3) compare <b>suspended</b> particulate <b>matter</b> in the eastern basin of Lake Erie with that in the central and western basins. Mean POC concentrations range from 175 to 4494 µg/L and mean PN concentrations range from 33 to 812 µg/L in this system. Mean POC/PN mass ratios are similar across all sampling locations, ranging between 4. 5 and 6. 9, and indicate that <b>suspended</b> particulate <b>matter</b> at these sites is mainly derived from autochthonous sources, particularly plankton. The ranges of δ 13 C (- 34 to - 22 ?) and δ 15 N (1 to 12 ?) identify terrestrial plants and soil matter, aquatic macrophytes, phytoplankton, and sewage as possible sources of <b>suspended</b> particulate <b>matter</b> at all sites. Plankton is probably the dominant source of <b>suspended</b> particulate <b>matter</b> at each site, with smaller contributions from allochthonous and other autochthonous sources. Significant differences in the concentration and isotope data between inflow and lake or outflow sites indicate that tributary inflows may receive greater contributions from terrestrial plants and soils and aquatic macrophytes than the lake and outflow. δ 15 N signatures also identify animal manure as a possible source of <b>suspended</b> particulate <b>matter</b> at the inflows.

[FN#1] Villages {{notorious for}} the {{peculiar}} Egyptian revelry, an undoubted {{relic of the}} good old times, when [...] "the most religious of men" [...] revelled at Canopus with an ardent piety in honour of Isis and Osiris.

The very mention of his name affronts the brave Wardanenses to the last extent, making them savage as Oxford bargees. [FN#3] The Barrage is a handsome bridge,-putting the style of architecture out of consideration,-the work of French engineers, originally projected by Napoleon the First. It was intended to act as a dam, raising the waters of the Nile and conducting them to Suez, the salt lakes, and a variety of other places, through a number of canals, which, however, have not yet been opened. Meanwhile, it acts upon the river's trunk as did the sea of old upon its embouchures, blocking it up and converting the land around it to the condition of a swamp. Moreover, it would have cleaned out the bed by means of sluice gates, forming an artificial increase of current to draw off the deposit; but the gates are wanting, so the piers, serving only to raise the soil by increasing the deposit of silt, collect and detain <b>suspended</b> <b>matter,</b> which otherwise would not settle. Briefly, by a trifling expenditure the Barrage might be made a blessing to Egypt; in its present state it is a calamity, an [...] "enormous, cruel wonder," [...] more crushing to the people than were the pyramids and sphinxes of old. [FN#4] Those skilled in simples, Eastern as well as Western, praise garlic highly, declaring that it [...] "strengthens the body, prepares the constitution for fatigue, brightens the sight, and, by increasing the digestive power, obviates the ill-effects arising from sudden change of air and water." [...] The traveller inserts it into his dietary in some pleasant form, as [...] "Provence-butter," [...] because he observes that, wherever fever and ague abound, the people, ignorant of cause but observant of effect, make it a common article of food. The old Egyptians highly esteemed this vegetable, which, with onions and leeks, enters into the list of articles so much regretted by the Hebrews (Numbers, xi. 5; Koran, chap. 2). The modern people of the Nile, like the Spaniards, delight in onions, which, as they contain between 25 and 30 per cent. of gluten, are highly nutritive. In Arabia, however, the stranger must use this vegetable sparingly. The city people despise it as the food of a Fellah-a boor. The Wahhabis have a prejudice against onions, leeks, and garlic, because the Prophet disliked their strong smell, and all strict Moslems refuse to eat them immediately before visiting the mosque, or meeting for public prayer.

Hence, nothing can be more terrible to a man than expulsion from caste; the excommunication of our feudal times was not a more dreadful form of living death.

[...] The reader will observe that I differ as decidedly from the Reviewer's opinion. Popular feeling towards the English in India was [...] "at first one of fear, afterwards of horror: Hindus and Hindis (Moslems) considered the strangers a set of cow-eaters and fire-drinkers, tetrae beluae ac molossis suis ferociores, who would fight like Iblis, cheat their own fathers, and exchange with the same readiness a broadside of shots and thrusts of boarding-pikes, or a bale of goods and a bag of rupees."

We have risen in a degree above such a low standard of estimation; still, incredible as it may appear to the Frank himself, it is no less true, that the Frank everywhere in the East is considered a contemptible being, and dangerous withal. As regards Indian opinion concerning our government, my belief is, that in and immediately about the three presidencies, where the people owe everything to and hold everything by our rule, it is most popular. At the same time I am convinced that in other places the people would most willingly hail any change. And how can we hope it to be otherwise,-we, a nation of strangers, aliens to the country's customs and creed, who, even while resident in India, act the part which absentees do in other lands? Where, in the history of the world, do we read that such foreign dominion ever made itself loved? [FN#12] This was written three years before the Indian Mutiny.
