25|$|In {{specular}} reflection, {{the direction}} of the reflected ray is determined by the angle the incident ray makes with the <b>surface</b> <b>normal,</b> a line perpendicular to the surface {{at the point where the}} ray hits. The incident and reflected rays and the normal lie in a single plane, and the angle between the reflected ray and the <b>surface</b> <b>normal</b> is the same as that between the incident ray and the normal.

In a real vector space the Hodge dual relates a {{subspace}} to its orthogonal complement, so if a bivector {{is represented by}} a plane then the axial vector associated with it is simply the plane's <b>surface</b> <b>normal.</b> The plane has two normals, one on each side, giving the two possible orientations for the plane and bivector.|$|E
25|$|Multi-scale {{approach}} is a multiple resolution approach in vessel segmentation. At low resolution, large-diameter vessels can first be extracted. By increasing resolution, smaller branches from the large vessels can be easily recognized. Therefore, one advantage of using this technique is the increased analytical speed. Additionally, this approach {{can be used with}} 3D images. The surface representation is a <b>surface</b> <b>normal</b> to the curvature of the vessels, allowing the detection of abnormalities on vessel surface.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} decompose a field of <b>surface</b> <b>normals</b> (needle-map). A diffusion process is used to model the flow of height information induced by a field of <b>surface</b> <b>normals.</b> The diffusion kernel can be decomposed into eigenmodes, each corresponding to approximately independent modes of variation of the flow. The <b>surface</b> <b>normals</b> can then be diffused using a modified kernel with the same eigenmodes but different coefficients. When used {{as part of a}} surface integration process, this procedure allows choosing the trade-off between local and global influence of each eigenmode in the modified field of <b>surface</b> <b>normals.</b> This graph-spectral method is illustrated with <b>surface</b> <b>normals</b> extracted from a face. Experiments are carried with local affinity functions that convey both the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the surface, and an information-theoretic definition of affinity. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{combinatorial}} {{method is}} used to reconstruct a surface by integrating a field of <b>surface</b> <b>normals.</b> An affinity function is defined over pairs of adjacent locations. This function {{is based on the}} surface’s principal curvature directions, which are intrinsic and can be estimated from the <b>surface</b> <b>normals.</b> The values of this locally supported function are propagated over the field of <b>surface</b> <b>normals</b> using a diffusion process. The <b>surface</b> <b>normals</b> are then regularised, by computing the weighted sum of the affinity evolved over time. Finally, the surface is reconstructed by integrating along integration paths that maximise the total affinity. Preliminary experimental results are shown for different degrees of evolution under the presence of noise. ...|$|R
25|$|No images {{provide a}} {{vertical}} view; in fact, the smallest angle between the planetary <b>surface</b> <b>normal</b> {{and the camera}} axis is about 50°. The high obliquity of the images, the wide range in sun-elevation angles, and the complete transection of the quadrangle by the gap in coverage greatly hamper geologic mapping. Only in about 15 percent of the quadrangle, near the southeast corner, do data permit separation of units with the confidence possible in other quadrangles on Mercury.|$|E
25|$|The Lorentz {{force is}} {{perpendicular}} {{to both the}} velocity of the electrons, {{which is in the}} plane of the disc, and to the magnetic field, which is normal (<b>surface</b> <b>normal)</b> to the disc. An electron at rest in the frame of the disc moves circularly with the disc relative to the B-field (i.e. the rotational axis or the laboratory frame, remember the note above), and so experiences a radial Lorentz force. In Figure 1 this force (on a positive charge, not an electron) is outward toward the rim according to the right-hand rule.|$|E
25|$|Unlike its predecessors, {{which used}} an engine based on 2D {{isometric}} graphics and sprites, SimCity 4 primarily uses a 3D engine to render its graphics.

Small buildings and props are drawn as flat images, which are pasted onto billboards; polygons with their <b>surface</b> <b>normal</b> facing into the camera. Larger buildings are modeled using a hybrid approach; a simple polygonal model defines {{the shape of}} the building, then textures are added to create detail such as doors, windows and rooftop clutter.|$|E

Further extensions to VCSOA technology are the demonstration of wavelength tunable devices. These MEMS-tunable vertical-cavity SOAs utilize a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based tuning mechanism for wide and continuous tuning of the peak gain wavelength of the amplifier. SOAs have a more rapid gain response, which is in the order of 1 to 100 ps.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} a new method of Shape from Shading, Shape from Isophotes. Shape from Isophotes uses the image isophotes for recovering the object <b>surface</b> <b>normals.</b> It is a propagation method. It initially directly recovers {{a small number}} of <b>surface</b> <b>normals</b> and then uses them to estimate normals at neighboring points in either adjacent isophotes or within the same isophote. The propagation can start either from occluding contours or singular points. Shape from Isophotes explicitly addresses brightness quantization errors, which can affect the performance of traditional Shape from Shading techniques. Since our method is based on the relationship between isophote curves and changes in <b>surface</b> <b>normals</b> [9, 10], it is mainly applicable to smooth diffuse surfaces. The accuracy of the proposed technique was measured using synthetic images of simple objects with Lambertian reflectance, as well as real objects of known geometry.

The method requires some interpolation, as it is possible that {{we may not be able}} to recover the <b>surface</b> <b>normals</b> at each pixel 1...|$|R

Convex cost function can be the negative entropy function, total variation (TV) function and filtered variation function. The convex cost function need not be differentiable everywhere. In general, we need to compute the gradient of the cost function to compute the <b>surface</b> <b>normals.</b> If the gradient does not exist at a given vector, {{it is possible to}} use the sub-gradients and the normal producing the smallest angle between the two vectors is used to compute the similarity measure. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{nature in}} which the tail groups {{organize}} themselves into a straight ordered monolayer {{is dependent on the}} inter-molecular attraction, or van der Waals forces, between the tail groups. To minimize the free energy of the organic layer the molecules adopt conformations that allow high degree of Van der Waals forces with some hydrogen bonding. The small size of the SAM molecules are important here because Van der Waals forces arise from the dipoles of molecules and are thus much weaker than the surrounding surface forces at larger scales. The assembly process begins {{with a small group of}} molecules, usually two, getting close enough that the Van der Waals forces overcome the surrounding force. The forces between the molecules orient them so they are in their straight, optimal, configuration. Then as other molecules come close by they interact with these already organized molecules in the same fashion and become a part of the conformed group. When this occurs across a large area the molecules support each other into forming their SAM shape seen in Figure 1. The orientation of the molecules can be described with two parameters: α and β. α is the angle of tilt of the backbone from the <b>surface</b> <b>normal.</b> In typical applications α varies from 0 to 60 degrees depending on the substrate and type of SAM molecule. β is the angle of rotation along the long axis of tee molecule. β is usually between 30 and 40 degrees. In some cases existence of kinetic traps hindering the final ordered orientation has been pointed out. Thus in case of dithiols formation of a [...] "lying down" [...] phase was considered an impediment to formation of [...] "standing up" [...] phase, however various recent studies indicate this is not the case.|$|E
