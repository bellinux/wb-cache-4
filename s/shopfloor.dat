Since its inception six decades ago, it has been under constant scientific scrutiny. Thus, the scientific study of co-determination does have a long tradition in this country. Scientists have been studying how its role in everyday life has changed - often caused by innovation to the legal environment, but more often than not by technological and organisational upheaval, economic structural change and the globalisation of business.

40|$|The {{discussion}} about the {{various aspects of the}} cost price ofthe respective services starts from the previous knowledge aboutthe role and significance of the sea and river ports within thetraffic system, and the scope of their services. The previousknowledge includes also the knowledge about the used meansof long-term assets which are in this study classified into followingthree groups: a) objects of infrast/Ucture, b) objects ofsuprast/Ucture, and c) <b>shopfloors</b> and equipment. The st/Ucture and functional purpose of these means confirmsthe high capital intensity of the sea and river port terminals,which leads to the high share of the fixed components ofthe costs in the cost price of these services. Most of the definitions of the cost price start from the factthat it {{is a part of the}} value or price of production, i. e. services,which accounts for the price of the used means (raw materialsand ftxed capital) and the price of the labour. The procedure of obtaining the cost price is called calculation,and certain 1 Ules or principles starting from punctuality,adaptability, updating, comparability, economic efficiency, etc. need to be complied with. Due to very high fragmentation of the sea and river port services,it is difficult to hannonise all the mentioned principles,and in calculating the full cost price various methods for calculatingthe common costs are applied, and the suitable methodsof distributing the common costs, i. e. overheads.

[...] An organization‚Äôs safety culture is ultimately reflected in the way safety is addressed in its workplaces (whether boardroom or <b>shopfloor).</b> In reality an organization's safety management system is not a set of policies and procedures on a bookshelf, but how those policies and procedures are implemented into the workplace, which will be influenced by the safety culture of the organization or workplace. [...] The UK HSE notes that safety culture is not just (nor even most significantly) an issue of <b>shopfloor</b> worker attitudes and behaviours [...] "Many companies talk about ‚Äòsafety culture‚Äô when referring to the inclination of their employees to comply with rules or act safety or unsafely.

40|$|Due to {{the steady}} {{tendency}} to propose highly customized products {{and to respond}} to volatile (i. e random) demands, Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) are now present in most <b>shopfloors.</b> In this thesis, flexibility in a FMS is understood as {{the ability of a}} single production cell to deliver several different types of items, say N. The production capacity is usually limited in the sense that only one or K¬†<¬†N type(s) of items can be simultaneously produced. Each type of item faces a specific market demand which often shows random fluctuations. To insure a high reactivity when facing such random demands, efficient production rules for the FMS are mandatory. These rules include in particular two generic entities, namely: Finished Goods Inventories. The fluctuations of i) the production flows, (due to failure-prone machines) and ii) the demand flows, can be partly absorbed by the presence of Finished Good Inventories (FIG). Such storage zones incur costs especially when serving highly customized demands. Clearly, the balance between the advantage of high reactivity {{on the one hand and}} storage costs on the other introduces complex optimization issues. The optimal solution will generally include hybrid production rules, i. e. certain types of products optimally require FIG (we call this strategy make-to-stock production), while other types require no FIG (we call this strategy make-to-order production). Dynamic Scheduling rules. The intrinsic presence of fluctuations implies that simple deterministic scheduling rules (as for example deterministic polling rules which produce each type j of items periodically during a fixed period of time Tj) may lead to a very poor performance. Clearly, an optimal production schedule will be based on both past experience and observation of the present state of the system (i. e the populations of the FIG and the instantaneous rates of the demand and production flows). Hence, any optimal scheduling rule will necessarily present a time adaptive character (i. e. real time scheduling rules). In spite of a growing usage of FMS in industry, the general problem of determining the optimal dynamic scheduling of flexible manufacturing systems remains, in its full generality, an open issue of operations research. In order to give some answers to the question of optimal scheduling, the present thesis will discuss two mathematical models known as "Multi-Armed Bandit Problem" (MABP) and "Restless Bandit Problem" (RBP) in terms of which the FMS can be modeled. Let us briefly recall the salient features of the Bandit formalization. In its basic version, the MABP considers a series of N stochastic processes (also called projects) evolving in parallel. At each time t, a decision maker (DM) can engage at most one project (this feature reflects the limited resource property). The engaged project generates an instantaneous cost while the disengaged projects incur no cost and remain fixed ("frozen" dynamic rule of the disengaged projects). The optimal scheduling problem in the MABP consists in choosing at each time t which project to engage in order to minimize the global cost over a given time horizon. An exact solution of the basic MABP has been given in 1974 by Gittins. The solution is based on the construction of a set of N priority indices (the so-called Gittins indices) which assign to each project an "urgency function" in terms of which the optimal dynamic scheduling reads: "At each instant, engage the item exhibiting the smallest priority index value". To use the MABP formalization in the production engineering context, the basic hypothesis of the "frozen" dynamics needs to be loosened. It is indeed mandatory to allow for the following features: Disengaged projects evolve in time and do incur costs. This generalization is necessary to reflect the fact that demands for items not currently produced continue to accrue and their FGI obviously also incurs costs. The assumptions in a) lead us to study the so-called "Restless Bandit problems" for which the optimal scheduling rule is yet unknown. As it has been noted in the (scarce) literature available, a naive generalization of the priority indices will definitely not yield the optimal rule. However, close to optimal solutions can still be expressed in terms of suitably generalized priority indices. The use of such indices has the determining advantage of leading to very simple [...] though sub-optimal [...] scheduling policies. This is indeed an essential feature of the production applications we have in mind. Hence, the construction of simple solvable models of optimal scheduling rules, will help to develop the perception needed to construct reliable heuristics applicable to the general problems. Accordingly, the general approach adopted in the present thesis is: Construct explicitly solvable classes of Bandit problems (Classical and Restless). Develop a heuristic to approach the problem of FMS and tests its validity on the basis of simulation studies. Moreover, as flexibility in a FMS generally generate setup penalties (such as the need for additional workforce incurring additional costs or cleaning operations imposing switching time delay) we will further: Construct an explicitly solvable class of MABP with setup penalties. Develop a heuristic to approach the general problem of MABP with setup costs and test its validity on the basis of the simple models introduced in iii). Our original contributions are: Explicit computation of the Gittins index for MABP (without switching penalties). We were able to compute explicitly the form of the Gittins indices when the evolution is given by a piecewise deterministic process which is intrinsically non-Markovian. This is among the few classes of non-Markovian examples in the literature for which the Gittins indices can be computed explicitly (M. -O. Hongler and F. Dusonchet, "Optimal stopping and Gittins indices for piecewise deterministic evolution process", Discrete Events Systems (2001) (11), 235 [...] 248). Explicit treatment of the Restless Multi-Armed Bandit process. We studied several underlying random dynamics relevant for the production engineering context, (e. g. diffusion processes as well as birth and death processes). We obtained explicit generalized priority indices and the resulting dynamic scheduling was compared with exact results derived numerically by A. Ha, (Oper. Res. 45, 1994, 42 - 53). Finally, using the RBP, we propose a sub-optimal heuristic solving the multi-items make-to-stock production problem (F. Dusonchet and M. -O. Hongler, "Continuous Time Restless Bandit and Dynamic Scheduling for Make-to-Stock Production", accepted for publication by IEEE Trans. on Robo. and Auto., (2003)). Construction of a sub-optimal heuristic for the MABP with setup penalties. Adding setup penalties to optimal control problems singularly increases the complexity of the solution. Therefore, very few results presently exist and the optimal decision problem with setups remains mostly unexplored. Our effort concentrates on the MABP with setup penalties and significant progress has been made by constructing a new class of MABP with setups for which the optimal policy can be explicitly constructed by recursion. Using this optimal derivation, we then propose a heuristic, approaching the optimal policy for general MABP with switching penalties (F. Dusonchet and M. -O.

50|$|This {{course was}} born in Japan and was {{intended}} for production technicians, so they could best contribute to the rebirth of the manufacturing industry in the postwar period. After World War II {{it was necessary to}} reconstruct the foundations of the Japanese industrial system: in May 1946 (year 22 of the Showa era) the Japan Management Association (JMA) decided to start off a course specifically conceived for the development of those skills and knowledge required to production technicians. That was the P-Course. The training format was basically an off-site program. It was held each time in a company that would host the lessons at its <b>shopfloor.</b> It consisted of sessions of intensive work until late evening and it lasted one full month. Such formula was based on the scheme of a former practical course held by the Nihon K≈çgy≈ç Ky≈çkai (Êó•Êú¨Â∑•Ê•≠Âçî‰ºö), which included in-depth study of operational activities and was 2 to 3 months long.

Rather, it is the ingrained organisational policies and standards which have repeatedly been shown to predate the catastrophe."However it is now also applied (with less certain validity) to individual accidents, and hence has come to relate to a full range of safety behaviors from the wearing of PPE (or not), the quality of delivery of a tool box talk, the quality of <b>shopfloor</b> response to fault conditions - or (what is frequently the main concern for major accidents) the extent to which safety considerations influence high level meetings and management decisions. A new starter or recently arrived sub contractor will soon pick up what the local norms are and be heavily influenced by them. If a tipping point of around 90% compliance is observed then these individuals will be highly likely to comply too - but if these individuals observe a 50:50 split then they may feel they have free choice as whatever they do they won't stand out.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{key factors}} that hold <b>shopfloor</b> control (SFC) {{software}} evolution back is the exorbitant cost, time, complexity, and inflexibility of developing customized SFC software solutions. The development and maintenance life-cycle of SFC software is characterized by lock-in problems. It {{is a fact that}} <b>shopfloor</b> environments constantly are changing, while the technology surrounding and supporting them often is changing faster. To handle these changes, the necessary software evolution has become the bottleneck. In this thesis, a literature survey shows that there exists a uniform view of general requirements on generic structures for <b>shopfloor</b> controllers. This work has adopted these general requirements in the design for a <b>shopfloor</b> control concept named Production Activity Control (PAC++). To gain experience and knowledge about modeling requirements, three pilot cases were defined. The objective in each pilot case is to gain an understanding of the development and implementation phases of <b>shopfloor</b> control models. The cases were placed on the work station-, cell-, and shop level in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hierarchical architecture. The PAC++ concept shows that by using a consistent modeling and implementation formalism, software modules become distributed and scalable. This gives the advantage to start with small and well-defined projects, while retaining the possibility to use an incrementally growing approach to a full-scale <b>Shopfloor</b> Control System, SFCS. Finally, the PAC++ has the built-in flexibility to improve and enhance its functionality during the whole life-cycle of a <b>shopfloor</b> control system, justifying development cost and time...|$|E
40|$|<b>Shopfloor</b> {{performance}} measures have {{significant impact on}} the overall performance of a manufacturing organisation. Measures are used in many ways to support the decision making function across an organisation. Many research suggest that many <b>shopfloor</b> measures used by manufacturers were derived when producers dominated market (Srikanth et al, 1995; Goldratt, 1988, 1990; Stein, 1994; Kaplan et al, 1992). Cost control was the major factor in ensuring profitable operations (Srikanth et al, 1995). Today cost-based measures are no longer appropriate as other critical dimensions are needed to maintain manufacturing competitiveness (Goldratt, 1990). The market condition dictates such things as faster lead times, increased variety of quality products and cost effective purchasing. Increasing competition has also forced producers to be more proactive in seizing every sales opportunity available. Cost-based measures fails because they focus too much on local improvements and short term performance that do not necessarily translate into overall improvement (Goldratt, 1992). Today manufacturing competitiveness come in three key dimensions: product, price and responsiveness (Goldratt, 1986). Shorter lead times and due date performance assist to achieve manufacturing responsiveness. In turn, these key factors rely on good <b>shopfloor</b> performance assisted by <b>shopfloor</b> measures. Theory of Constraints synchronisation principles were looked at and analysed to explore how they could be used to derive working <b>shopfloor</b> measures. Synchronisation of activities is important to bring about the desired performance through synergy. The step by step approaches of the Five Focusing Steps and the synchronisation mechanism offered by the DBR scheduling could be used as the benchmark whereby <b>shopfloor</b> measures are derived. The TOC performance measurement, Throughput, Inventory and Operating Expense measures, should be the objectives of <b>shopfloor</b> measures achievements...|$|E

40|$|Extant {{research}} documents {{a positive}} relationship between the adoption of new HRM practices at the managerial and <b>shopfloor</b> level, and innovation performance, respectively. However, studies focusing on the managerial level distinguish between different types of innovation, while studies at the <b>shopfloor</b> level regard innovation as a homogenous activity. Thus, it is still an open question whether and to what extent the findings at the managerial level apply to the <b>shopfloor</b> level. We address this question by focusing on the introduction of exploitative technological innovation and the adoption of new HRM practices at the firm‚Äôs lowest hierarchical level. We suggest a positive relation between the two via firm‚Äôs productive capabilities as employees‚Äô ability and learning incrementally improve firm‚Äôs existing products and processes.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of customized production results in huge {{challenges to the}} traditional manufacturing systems. In order to allocate resources timely according to the production requirements and to reduce disturbances, a framework for the future intelligent <b>shopfloor</b> is proposed in this paper. The framework consists of three primary models, namely the model of smart machine agent, the self-organizing model, and the self-adaptive model. A cyber-physical system for manufacturing <b>shopfloor</b> based on the multiagent technology is developed to realize the above-mentioned function models. Gray relational analysis and the hierarchy conflict resolution methods were applied to achieve the self-organizing and self-adaptive capabilities, thereby improving the reconfigurability and responsiveness of the <b>shopfloor.</b> A prototype system is developed, which has the adequate flexibility and robustness to configure resources {{and to deal with}} disturbances effectively. This research provides a feasible method for designing an autonomous factory with exception-handling capabilities...|$|E
40|$|Computer {{numerical}} controlled (CNC) machines play {{an important}} role in the production capacity of manufacturing enterprises. With the advance of computing technology, computer-aided systems (CAx) have been intensively used together with the CNC machines. The information flow from CAx to CNC machines is unidirectional, due to the widespread use of G&M codes to programme the CNC machines and the mechanism of the generation of part programmes. The CNC machines at the <b>shopfloor</b> have been isolated from the CAx chain. There is no automatic way to capture and feedback the <b>shopfloor</b> knowledge. Reusing <b>shopfloor</b> process knowledge offers the enterprises opportunities to improve manufacturing quality and control while enabling savings in cost and time. Rapid product development relies heavily on quick and reliable process planning and knowledge reuse to facilitate the process plan efficiently and effectively. In this research, the process comprehension approach has been utilised to capture the process knowledge at the <b>shopfloor.</b> A novel method has been proposed to reuse the process knowledge with different manufacturing resources. In this paper, a short review on manufacturing knowledge management is provided. The process comprehension approach is then presented. An example part is used as the case study to illustrate the knowledge capture using process comprehension and how the process knowledge can be utilised to manufacture the product with new manufacturing resources...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 40 years {{manufacturing}} industry {{has enjoyed a}} rapid growth {{with the support of}} various computer-aided systems (CAD, CAPP, CAM etc.) known as CAx. Since the first Numerically Controlled (NC) machine appeared in 1952, there have been many advances in CAx resource capabilities. The information integration and interoperability between different manufacturing resources has become an important and popular research area over the last decade. Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machines are an important link in the manufacturing chain and the major contributor to the production capacity of manufacturing industry today. However, most of the research has focused on the information integration of upper systems in the CAD/CAPP /CAM/CNC manufacturing chain, leaving the shop floor as an isolated information island. In particular, there is limited opportunity to capture and feed <b>shopfloor</b> knowledge back to the upper systems. Furthermore, the part programs for the machines are not exchangeable due to the. machine specific postprocessors. Thus there is a further need to consider information interoperability between different CNC machine and other systems. This research investigates the reverse transformation of the CNC part programmes into higher level of process information, entitled process comprehension, to enable the <b>shopfloor</b> interoperability. A novel framework of universal process comprehension is specified and designed. The framework provides a reverse direction of information flow from the CNC machine to upper CAx systems, enabling the interoperability and recycling of the <b>shopfloor</b> knowledge. A prototype implementation of the framework is realised and utilised to demonstrate the functionalities through three industrially inspired test components. The major contribution of this research to knowledge is the new vision of the <b>shopfloor</b> interoperability associated with process knowledge capture and reuse. The research shows that process comprehension of part programmes can provide an effective solution to the issues of the <b>shopfloor</b> interoperability and knowledge reuse in manufacturing industries.

40|$|Standing for all {{instances}} of problematic workplace sexuality, {{the notion of}} ‚Äòsexual harassment‚Äô illuminates but also obscures the role of desire in work relations. It spotlights isolated individual interactions {{at the expense of}} structural processes and stresses choice and blame rather than the way in which a given workplace evokes particular sexual subjectivities in the service of production. An ethnography of <b>shopfloor</b> relations in a Mexican export-processing plant shows how labor control operates through the interpellation of both workers and supervisors as sexual subjects. In this plant, panoptic architecture evokes and focuses the male gaze in the service of ‚Äòquality‚Äô and ‚Äòefficiency‚Äô, and desire emerges as a force of production. Male supervisors are located as voyeurs and young female workers as sexual objects to be consumed. Worker efficiency and desirability are conflated and workers become subject to management for the affirmation of both. In such a setting, framing <b>shopfloor</b> sexuality as aberrant distracts from its primary, and equally problematic, function as a <b>shopfloor</b> discipline. ¬© 2000, SAGE Publications.

40|$|As {{information}} technology (IT) capabilities increase, manufacturing businesses are realigning their information systems infrastructure to remain competitive. This {{has resulted in}} substantial increases in IT use in technical areas of the business. Nevertheless, conventional paper-based information systems are still common at the <b>shopfloor.</b> Hence, manufacturers need to understand whether there is any benefit in extending IT functionality to the <b>shopfloor.</b> The focus {{of this research is}} the support of the CNC machinist, who has a specific set of craft skills and knowledge that are a core business capability in the metal cutting industry. By evaluating the impact of hypermedia information systems upon the independent decision-making and communication capabilities of CNC machinists, this research aims to provide an understanding of the <b>shopfloor</b> performance benefits of replacing existing paper-based systems with this relatively new technology. This research finds that in CNC machining environments where there are limited divisions of labour, hypermedia-based manufacturing instructions support CNC machinist independent decision-making and cross-boundary communications as effective as paper-based manufacturing instructions. CNC machinists also demonstrate an acceptance of the new technology. Hence, the sponsor and the research community can pursue continued research to develop the technical and social systems to achieve predicted business benefits.

40|$|This study explores {{workplace}} {{relations in}} the small-firm-dominated West Midlands clothing sector. Using a combination of direct observation, survey work and my status as an. 'insider', the thesis examines three major issues. Firstly, the processes involved in the negotiation of order in small firms. Secondly, the role of management in shaping work relations. Thirdly, {{the extent to which}} ethnicity is a significant factor in determining <b>shopfloor</b> behaviour. Despite the recent interest in industrial relations in small firms, the debates on management strategy and the various studies on 'ethnic enterprise', these issues have received little attention elsewhere. It is commonly believed that employers in this sector respond to the uncertainties of operating in a volatile market by casualisation and the intensive use of familial labour in the management of the firm. Although widespread, such practices were shown to be not entirely 'rational' and, in certain circumstances, important constraints upon management. The pressures emanating from the market were compounded by uncertainties on the <b>shopfloor.</b> Rather than managerial autocracy, the organisation of the workplace was characterised by informality, unpredictability and struggle. The contested nature of the workplace thus highlighted the contradictory position of management; having to accommodate market pressures {{on the one hand and}} the need to negotiate on the <b>shopfloor</b> on the other. Ethnicity further mediated <b>shopfloor</b> relations. The gendered basis of ethnicity, together with its capacity to 'work' to the advantage of minority women as well as migrant men highlighted the multi-faceted nature of the concept. Moreover, the relationship between ethnicity and the labour process is demonstrated. In conclusion, the findings establish the 'relative autonomy' of the labour process, the pattern of control in the West Midland clothing industry and provide concrete empirical support for the conceptualisations of management provided by Hyman (1987) and Edwards (1986) ...|$|E
