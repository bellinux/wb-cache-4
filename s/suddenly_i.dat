25|$|It was Hofmann. It was, I think, {{his last}} {{performance}} in Toronto, {{and it was}} a staggering impression. The only thing I can really remember is that, when I was being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E
25|$|The {{one-step}} {{and other}} dances {{had been done}} to the tempo of Memphis Blues.... When St Louis Blues was written the tango was in vogue. I tricked the dancers by arranging a tango introduction, breaking abruptly into a low-down blues. My eyes swept the floor anxiously, then <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> saw lightning strike. The dancers seemed electrified. Something within them came suddenly to life. An instinct that wanted so much to live, to fling its arms to spread joy, took them by the heels.|$|E
25|$|But in 1951 I {{found myself}} in serious difficulty. I had been {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to {{stop in front of}} the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had come back to me and had brought me a gift.|$|E

500|$|Gunn's {{reflections}} on joining Hibernian are tinged with regret: [...] " [...] very difficult indeed. I had spent 12 great years at Norwich and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> was not {{regarded as the}} number 1 (by Mike Walker) anymore." [...] He joined Hibernian when they were bottom of the Scottish Premier Division; Alex McLeish had recently been appointed manager.|$|E
500|$|After Aaliyah's death, the German {{newspaper}} Die Zeit published {{excerpts from}} an interview done shortly before her death, {{in which she}} described a recurring dream: [...] "It is dark in my favorite dream. Someone is following me. I don't know why. I'm scared. Then <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> lift off. Far away. How do I feel? As if I am swimming in the air. Free. Weightless. Nobody can reach me. Nobody can touch me. It's a wonderful feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|.....it's {{encouraging}} {{to win a}} prize. But the success of Tirra Lirra, plus the prize it won and the two prizes The Impersonators won, made me feel less private and more vulnerable, and I had to get over {{that in order to}} go on at all. I had never been interviewed before, or I had never been asked to be interviewed, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> had all these interviews. It was a challenge I found hard to meet. I almost wished I had kept writing under a pseudonym as I had begun… ...|$|E

500|$|An {{offensive}} minded player {{throughout his}} amateur and minor professional career, St. Louis {{was forced into}} a checking-line role by the Calgary Flames. He credits the experience for rounding out his game: [...] "I played a true third-line role, killing penalties and playing against the other team's top lines. For me, {{it was like a}} five-month crash course on developing my defensive game. My whole life, I had been an offensive player, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> was in the role of trying to be smart without the puck. I think those fifty-six games helped me develop into a complete player." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Because" [...] was {{inspired}} by Lennon listening to Ono playing Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Moonlight Sonata" [...] on the piano. He recalled he was [...] "lying on the sofa in our house, listening to Yoko play... <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>I</b> said, 'Can you play those chords backward?' She did, and I wrote 'Because' around them." [...] The track features three-part harmonies by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, which were then triple-tracked to give nine voices in the final mix. The group considered the vocals to {{be some of the}} hardest and most complex they attempted. Harrison played the Moog synthesizer, and Martin played the harpsichord that opens the track.|$|E
500|$|Carradine {{formed an}} acting company {{that he called}} Kansas Flyer', a metaphor for a check that bounces." [...] He {{acquired}} a broken-down carousel in a junk yard in Los Angeles, and some broken horses in Kansas City. He and his entourage then headed for Drury, Kansas. The original working title of the film was Around. While exploring film title designs for the picture, Carradine came across a style called Americana. [...] "I {{was trying to figure}} out what it would look like if it said Around. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>I</b> said to myself, 'Why am I doing this, anyway? It's right here in front of me.' I called up the title designer and told him I was changing the title to Americana." ...|$|E

60|$|Mine was a milder and slighter experience, but its thrill was of {{the same}} kind.

500|$|Composer Bear McCreary {{changed his}} synth {{programming}} {{for the series}} from [...] "warm, round tones" [...] to a [...] "mangled under heavy distortion" [...] sound. He began the episode without any synths, describing his music for the episode's opening scene as [...] "among the most shamelessly orchestral I’ve ever done for this series ... I wanted the score to feel like it belonged in the 1940's, with a retro, adventurous attitude." [...] Then, [...] "just as the audience begins to get used to" [...] the orchestral sound, the episode cuts to [...] "modern day and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> bring in the new synths, with distorted basses blazing over the nastiest groove I've ever written for the show. The transition is hopefully as jarring as I intended—jumping from soaring orchestra to blasting electronica, as we leap forward in time seventy years." ...|$|E
500|$|Malone {{credited}} Howarth's versatility {{with the}} reason he was cast as Todd. [...] During a February 1993 interview with Soap Opera Digest (SOD), Howarth stated he was surprised he won the part. [...] "I really don't know how I made it," [...] he said. He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned just like everybody else". He [...] "made it to callbacks, and [...] got the part". Howarth said, [...] "I was hired... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. All I knew was that my first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. They called me in again and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> had a last name 'Manning.' Then I get called to read another day." ...|$|E
500|$|From 2006 to 2008, M.I.A. {{lived in}} the Bedford-Stuyvesant {{neighbourhood}} of Brooklyn, New York, where she met Benjamin Bronfman (a.k.a. Benjamin Brewer), an environmentalist, founder of Green Owl, musician {{and member of the}} Bronfman family and Lehman family. They became engaged and she gave birth to their son, Ikhyd Edgar Arular Bronfman, on 13 February 2009, just three days after performing at the Grammy Awards. In February 2012, it was announced that she and Bronfman had split. In a 2013 interview with Ferrari Sheppard, M.I.A. commented on her relationship with Bronfman and his family's wealth: [...] "I think it’s weird. It’s not that I got with Ben and then <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> was a billionaire. You know? I got with Ben, and I realised that we do come from different worlds, but it’s interesting that it is more about the concepts of, again, elitism and power. Who Ben is on paper sounds way more powerful than who I am because of where he comes from." ...|$|E
60|$|Yet {{upon that}} afternoon, {{whether it was}} the Beaune which I had taken with my lunch, or the {{additional}} exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his manner, <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> felt that <b>I</b> could hold out no longer.|$|R

500|$|Nageswara Rao {{played the}} role of a 90-year-old man. His {{character}} enters the film just before the interval and remains until {{the very end of the}} film. All the members of the principal cast except Nageswara Rao played dual roles in the film. Nagarjuna said in an interview that he would be seen in the 1920s, 1980s and 2013 and would play a zamindar in 1920. Saran revealed that every character in the film would have a specific aspect; Nagarjuna's character loves cars. Regarding her role, Saran said that she would be seen as a poor but content farmer in the flashback sequences and a doctor in the present day. She added [...] "My character goes back to 1930s and comes back in the present era. I can't tell how it happens though. It's a fun character and you will find me stammering a lot. Suddenly, I'm talking normally and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> start stammering, that's how you understand my character." [...] She added that apart from Nagarjuna, she has more scenes with Nageswara Rao and only a couple of scenes with Chaitanya in the film.|$|E
500|$|... "Today" [...] was {{the first}} song Corgan wrote for Siamese Dream. Corgan said, [...] "The day after I wrote 'Today,' my manager heard it and said, 'It's a hit,' and I guess in a way, it was." [...] Corgan played the self-recorded demo to {{producer}} Butch Vig and {{to the rest of}} his band, all of whom responded positively. [...] "Today" [...] already had a chord progression and a melody, but Corgan felt there needed to be an opening riff to the song. One day, [...] "out of the blue, I heard the opening lick note for note in my head", Corgan said. [...] "When I added the opening riff, it completely changed the character of the song. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>I</b> had a song that was starting out quiet and then got very loud." [...] Soon afterwards, Virgin Records executives were sent to check up on the band after hearing about their problems, but were pleased with the demo. The reaction from the executives only served to put more stress on Corgan; as a result, he recorded most of the guitar and bass guitar parts himself, including on the finished version of [...] "Today".|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the production, the {{creative}} styles of Anderson and Parrish came into conflict. Anderson remembered that on several occasions Kanter was called on to mediate: [...] " [...] both knew how important the picture was to our careers, and we both desperately {{wanted to be in the}} big time." [...] During one session, Parrish refused to follow the shooting script, having determined independently that not all the scripted scenes were essential to the plot. When Anderson reminded Parrish of his contractual responsibilities, the director announced to the cast and crew, [...] "Hell, you heard the producer. If I don't shoot these scenes which I don't really want, don't need and will cut out anyway, I'll be in breach of contract. So what we'll do is shoot those scenes next!" [...] Anderson discussed how the production of Doppelgänger presented new challenges, explaining, [...] "I had worked for so many years employing directors to do what I told them... <b>Suddenly</b> <b>I</b> came up against a Hollywood movie director who didn't want to play and we ended up extremely bad friends." [...] In his 2002 biography, Anderson stated that his sole regret about the film [...] " [...] that I hired Bob Parrish in the first place." [...] Sylvia Anderson comments that Parrish's direction was [...] "uninspired. We had a lot of trouble getting what we wanted from him." ...|$|E

500|$|The album's opening {{series of}} songs have {{straightforward}} lyrics. On [...] "Back to Love", Bilal flatters his date's shoes and {{is backed by}} a bubbling funk groove. The song draws on the music of Prince, while the jazz guitar licks of [...] "Winning Hand" [...] draw on Steely Dan. [...] "Climbing" [...] has a rugged beat and a lyrical allusion to The Notorious B.I.G.'s 1993 song [...] "Party and Bullshit". The middle section of the album explores broader emotions and themes of loss and lament. [...] "Slipping Away" [...] is a slow-building meditation on loss, with sentimental music backing the narrator's plea to a departing love. On the slow burning pop rock song [...] "Lost for Now", he comes to terms with being alone and leaves town, but finds salvation in [...] "a smile that changes everything" [...] as the song closes with a shimmer of cymbal. The stark ballad [...] "Butterfly" [...] is built around Bilal's soaring falsetto and Glasper's rippling piano. Its music explores jazz, and also features dreamy Moog accents. The album closes with lyrics about the promise of tomorrow: [...] "Woke up this morning {{to the sound of}} a bluebird singing / <b>Suddenly</b> <b>I</b> knew just where to begin / Something so simple / How can it speak so loud to me?" ...|$|E
