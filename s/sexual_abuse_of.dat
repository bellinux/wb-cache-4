The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> survivors and forgiveness. The basic research question was does the childhood experience <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse,</b> long-term effects <b>of</b> childhood <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse,</b> global presence <b>of</b> pain, and previous treatment experiences predict level of forgiveness toward the perpetrator(s) by the survivor <b>of</b> childhood <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse?</b> The Hargrave model of forgiveness was utilized in this study, yielding four separate regression analyses. The null was rejected for all four regressions. The general findings suggest that <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> treatment does influence the work of forgiveness for survivors and the increased levels of hurt hinder the work <b>of</b> forgiveness. <b>Sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> treatment providers have generally overlooked forgiveness as a treatment consideration in the care of survivors. However, the findings from this study indicate that forgiveness could be useful in treating survivors and should not be overlooked when treating survivors <b>of</b> childhood <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> Forgiveness <b>of</b> perpetrator(s) by adult survivors <b>of</b> childhood <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> can be better understood by knowing the demographic variables of the survivor, childhood experience <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse,</b> long-term effects <b>of</b> childhood <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse,</b> the global presence of pain, and previous treatment histories of the survivor...|$|R
