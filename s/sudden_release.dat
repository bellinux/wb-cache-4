5|$|Drive is a 2011 American neo-noir crime film {{directed}} by Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn and written by Hossein Amini, {{based on the}} eponymous 2005 novel by James Sallis. It stars Ryan Gosling as an unnamed Hollywood stunt driver moonlighting as a getaway driver, whose budding relationship with his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio is disrupted by the <b>sudden</b> <b>release</b> of her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) from prison. Debt-ridden, Standard hires him {{to take part in}} what {{turns out to be a}} botched, million-dollar heist that endangers their lives. Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks, Ron Perlman, and Albert Brooks play supporting roles. The film premiered on May 11 in competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, before being released by FilmDistrict in American theaters on September 16. Drive earned a worldwide total of $76.1 million on a production budget of $15 million. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, surveyed 238 reviews and judged 92% to be positive.|$|E

25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{can be used}} {{to extinguish}} small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire, as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. However, it should not be applied to fires in deep fryers; the <b>sudden</b> <b>release</b> of gas may cause the grease to splatter.

The alkaline nature of sodium bicarbonate makes it the only dry chemical agent, besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale fire suppression systems installed in commercial kitchens. Because it can act as an alkali, the agent has a mild saponification effect on hot grease, which forms a smothering, soapy foam.|$|E

The patient was successfully managed with a quick surgical intervention and further critical care for thyroid storm. Although it is widely believed that pancreatitis is seldom concurrent with thyrotoxicosis, thyroid storm can be precipitated by a variety of factors, including intra-abdominal infections such as acute pancreatitis or perforated peptic ulcer. In conclusion, acute pancreatitis in patients with thyrotoxicosis seems to be extremely rare, but such patients should be managed intensively against underlying thyroid disorders as well as pancreatitis...|$|R
5000|$|The {{reservoir}} is used {{mostly for}} flood control storage, and is rarely filled to its [...] capacity. During the dry season, water from Spring Creek pools in a small, stagnant pond retained behind the dam, depositing contaminated sediment and acidic mine {{waste in the}} reservoir space. When flows from the Shasta Dam, upstream on the Sacramento River, are sufficient to flush contaminated water away, water held in the reservoir is released through the outlet works into the Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River. Despite this operation strategy, the reservoir was eventually deemed inadequate for the watershed, and can be filled to capacity by a single heavy storm event. Uncontrollable spills frequently poured into the Sacramento River during floods, through the crest spillway of the dam, which lacks gates. As a result, numerous fish kills have occurred during these <b>sudden</b> <b>releases</b> of contaminants, a major {{one of which was}} in 1969.|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} the {{standard}} numerical methods used to solve the two-dimensional shallow water wave equations are unstable if their domains contain dry beds. We present a robust and stable nite volume method based on an unstructured triangular grid which can deal with dry beds.

The method uses a simple approximate one dimensional Riemann solver due to Toro which provides the basis for an ecient implementation. 1 Introduction The shallow water equations are used extensively to model the behavior of ows produced by precipitation or {{as a result of}} the failure of man-made structures. These problems generally involve <b>sudden</b> <b>releases</b> of water or intense rainfall bursts which produce rapid runo.

2500|$|In geomorphology, an {{outburst}} flood, {{which is a}} type of megaflood, is a high-magnitude, low-frequency catastrophic flood involving the <b>sudden</b> <b>release</b> of water. During the last deglaciation, numerous glacial lake outburst floods were caused by the collapse of either ice sheets or glaciers that formed the dams of proglacial lakes. Examples of older outburst floods are known from the geological past of the Earth and inferred from geomorphological evidence on Mars. [...] Landslides, lahars, and volcanic dams can also block rivers and create lakes, which trigger such floods when the rock or earthen barrier collapses or is eroded. Lakes also form behind glacial moraines, which can collapse and create outburst floods.|$|E
2500|$|An {{earthquake}} [...] is {{the result}} of a <b>sudden</b> <b>release</b> of energy in the Earth's crust that creates seismic waves. [...] At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by vibration, shaking, and sometimes displacement of the ground. Earthquakes are caused by slippage within geological faults. The underground point of origin of the earthquake is called the seismic focus. The point directly above the focus on the surface is called the epicenter. Earthquakes by themselves rarely kill people or wildlife. It is usually the secondary events that they trigger such as building collapse, fires, tsunamis (seismic sea waves) and volcanoes. Many of these could possibly be avoided by better construction, safety systems, early warning and planning.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAircraft {{fuel systems}} {{are subject to}} icing at low temperatures.

They threaten the safety of flights and {{have been the subject}} of several investigations over past years. Jet engines fuel system components may sensitive to clogging. When a snow shower happens, ice particles settle in seconds, forming a porous layer. Modelling such events involves transient hydraulics and solid dynamics. We propose to investigate numerically the dynamics of transient particle clogging. Equations of motion for the incompressible fluid phase are discretized in a high-order finite-volume context and solved using a pressure-based algorithm. The discrete phase is modelled in a Lagrangian frame. Contacts between solids are handled by a dedicated algorithm. Solid volume fraction is calculated in regions occupied by particles. Finally, two-way coupling is achieved by source terms for momentum exchange, viscous and inertial loss. 2 D simulation of the clogging of an ideal filter is performed...|$|R

40|$|Based on the glacial flood {{events and}} climate change in the Yarkant River basin during the past 50 years, the study {{investigated}} the long-term change of temperature and precipitation, the characteristics of glacial floods, the origin of <b>sudden</b> flood <b>release,</b> the suggested flood mechanism of glacial lakes {{and the relationship between}} glacial floods {{and climate change}}. Results showed that there was an obvious increase in the temperature of the basin since 1987. Specifically in the mountainous area, the significantly increasing temperature in the summer and autumn seasons accelerated the melting rate of glaciers and caused glacial-lake burst. <b>Sudden</b> flood <b>release</b> occurred frequently. The frequency of glacial-lake outburst floods was 0. 4 times/a during the period 1959 - 1986 and increased to 0. 7 times/a during 1997 - 2006. Peak discharge also increased. There were seven floods with peak discharge over 4000 m(3) /s from 1959 - 2006, and three occurred after 1997. The increasing frequency and magnitude of glacial outburst floods mirrored the effect of climate warming on glaciers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved...|$|R
