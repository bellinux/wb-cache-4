40|$|Abstract. A {{functional}} automotive part, reaction <b>shaft</b> <b>support,</b> was fabricated {{by local}} squeeze and vacuum Diecasting (LSVD) with light-weight Al- 15 %Si hypereutectic alloy which has good fluidity and excellent wear resistance. The effects of local squeezing pressure and time-lag of LSVD process on the microstructure {{of the product}} were investigated. Measurement of specific gravity with the change of local squeeze pressure and time-lag showed that the local squeezing effect can be increased by increasing squeeze pressure and decreasing time-lag. However, too high a squeeze pressure and too a low time-lag brought about insufficient squeezing effect due to instant movement to the squeeze plunger stroke end point. Through the combination of vacuum suction before melt injection and local squeezing after melt injection in LSVD process, light-weight Al- 15 %Si alloy reaction <b>shaft</b> <b>support</b> was successfully developed, resulting in excellent microstructural and mechanical propertie...|$|E

40|$|The use of face gears in {{helicopter}} transmissions was explored. A light-weight, {{split torque}} transmission design utilizing face gears was described. Face-gear design and geometry were investigated. Topics included tooth generation, limiting {{inner and outer}} radii, tooth contact analysis, contact ratio, gear eccentricity, and structural stiffness. Design charts were developed to determine minimum and maximum face-gear inner and outer radii. Analytical study of transmission error showed face-gear drives were relatively insensitive to gear misalignment, but tooth contact was affected by misalignment. A method of localizing bearing contact to compensate for misalignment was explored. The proper choice of <b>shaft</b> <b>support</b> stiffness enabled good load sharing in the split torque transmission design.

Meeting these criteria guarantees that shaft elastic deflections and strains are eliminated. Consequently, such strains will not affect the estimation of geometrical deviations of the measured object.
