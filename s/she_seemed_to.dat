5|$|Occasionally {{there had}} been a muffled thud or deadened {{explosion}} within the ship. Now, without warning <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees. This movement with the water rushing up toward us was accompanied by a rumbling roar, mixed with more muffled explosions. It was like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with the noise of a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.|$|E
5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior. Another case {{was described by}} Walters and Card (1996) in which a female was found {{at the entrance of}} a chamber with seven neonates crawling on or around her. When one of the young was moved a short distance from the chamber, <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be agitated and faced the intruder. Eventually, all of her offspring retreated into the chamber, but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 1800, when Anning was 15 months old, {{an event}} {{occurred}} that {{became part of}} local lore. She was being held by a neighbour, Elizabeth Haskings, who was standing with two other women under an elm tree watching an equestrian show being put on by a travelling company of horsemen, when lightning struck the tree killing all three women below. Onlookers rushed the infant home where she was revived in a bath of hot water. A local doctor declared her survival miraculous. Her family {{said she had been}} a sickly baby before the event but afterwards <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> blossom. For years afterward members of her community would attribute the child's curiosity, intelligence and lively personality to the incident.|$|E

5000|$|Dusty - She was {{introduced}} {{early in the}} second series as a yellow and orange aeroplane and is energetic and friendly. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be good friends with Rora. In [...] "A Song for the Farm", <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be making a lot of noise in her sleep, and she accidentally woken up Rora. She hates having baths in [...] "Come Back Dusty", because she will get soap in her eyes. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> do the loop-the-loops.|$|R

25|$|Charlotte taught, {{and wrote}} about her {{students}} without much sympathy. Emily did not settle and {{after three months}} <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> decline {{and had to be}} taken home to the parsonage. Anne took her place and stayed until Christmas 1837.|$|E
25|$|An agonised Darwin {{stayed at}} Annie's bedside as the crisis deepened. Dr Gully {{attended}} {{through the night}} thinking her unlikely to last, but at 6 a.m. she vomited and her condition stabilised. <b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> recover slightly {{and a series of}} ups and downs followed with Darwin and Fanny Wedgwood anxiously watching and writing home, but she deteriorated and died on 23 April 1851.|$|E
25|$|Queen Mary {{design was}} criticised {{for being too}} traditional, {{especially}} when Normandie hull was revolutionary with a clipper-shaped, streamlined bow. Except for her cruiser stern, <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be an enlarged version of her Cunard predecessors from the pre–First World War era. Her interior design, while mostly Art Deco, seemed restrained and conservative {{when compared to the}} ultramodern French liner. Queen Mary proved to be the more popular vessel than her larger rival, in terms of passengers carried.|$|E
50|$|A rather {{cool and}} {{proactive}} girl, she is Inori Sae's sister-in-arms who <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have some plans regarding the hoshitori duels, {{and wants to}} defeat Hitsugi Amachi with her own hands. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be easily annoyed when other people {{get too close to}} her, and appears to be insensitive (as Sae describes her), but actually is the opposite as shown in later volumes. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> care deeply for others, but does not show it and even denies it. <b>She</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be as powerful as the student council president, Hitsugi. Hayate sees her as a mentor.|$|R
50|$|Rachel {{is later}} {{discharged}} from the hospital. When she tries {{to get out of}} the car, <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> cower in fear because of a puddle. Richard reintroduces her to the house, but <b>she</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> notice the picture of Jimmy. Conan and Eva later try to regain her memory.|$|R

25|$|On 17 March 1920, {{at the age}} of 23, {{while she}} was walking on a street with her mother, a delinquent youth struck her in the back with an iron bar for no {{apparent}} reason. As a result of that injury, she was confined to bed for three months. Although <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have recovered, and was able to move around for over a decade thereafter, the complications from that incident eventually confined her to bed for 28 years, from April 1934 to the end of her life.|$|E
25|$|After some {{search for}} the girl, I interviewed a nightclub dancer who had just scored in a small {{emotional}} part in a play that did not run (The Noose). <b>She</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have the quality I wanted, a sort of rough poignancy. She at once displayed more sensitive, easily expressed emotion than I had encountered since Pauline Lord. She and (Hal) Skelly were the perfect team, and they made the play a great success. I had great plans for her, but the Hollywood offers kept coming. There was no competing with them. She became a picture star. She is Barbara Stanwyck.|$|E
25|$|Fields' health {{declined}} in July 1979, when she contracted pneumonia after performing an open-air concert on the Royal Yacht which was docked in Capri's harbour. After a spell in hospital, <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be recovering, but died on 27 September 1979. The press reported she died holding her husband's hand, {{but in reality}} he was at their Anacapri home at the time, while Gracie was home with the housekeeper, Irena. She is buried in Capri's Protestant Cemetery in a white marble tomb. Her coffin was carried by staff from her restaurant. Her husband Boris died on 3 July 1983.|$|E

25|$|The {{couple had}} five children, {{one of whom}} did not survive infancy. Although the {{marriage}} was arranged, the couple got along quite well, and at least during the first years, their relationship was described as happy. Frederick was comfortable with her, and Louise {{pretended not to notice}} his adultery. Though Frederick came to feel high regard for her and always treated her with kindness, however, he reportedly was not in love with her and continued to have affairs after their marriage. She quickly made herself popular in the Danish court, and her father-in-law remarked that <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> him to be kind and agreeable.|$|E
25|$|The maltreatment {{of cattle}} at the Smithfield Market {{prompted}} Elizabeth Heyrick in 1823 to publish anonymously a stinging rebuke to those acting cruelly {{as well as}} to what she perceived was an apparent lack of punitive action taken against the perpetrators. Heyrick's short work began with strong words directed at the supporters of Martin's Act for not prosecuting those who abused animals. However <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be unaware that Broome had in 1822 already personally brought to court some individuals against whom charges of cruelty were heard. He also from his own pocket paid the salary for an inspector to monitor the abuse of animals at the Smithfield Market.|$|E
25|$|After the war, {{although}} Cliff was occasionally {{nostalgic for}} the 'Bizarre' years, as witnessed in personal letters to friends, <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be realistic {{and accepted the}} commercial taste was for conservative ware. Clarice seemed to enjoy playing a lesser role at the factory, knowing {{that she could not}} recapture those crazy days of the thirties. Much of the post-war production went to Australia, New Zealand or North America, where the taste was for formal ware in traditional English designs such as Tonquin rather than the striking patterns and shapes that had established Cliff's reputation; thus she was never to return to creative work. The post-war ware has little value at auction.|$|E

25|$|Psychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block {{evaluated}} Genie in February 1971 and put {{her language}} below the two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but {{could not be sure}} about the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary because she was so responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences. Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.|$|E
25|$|As Genie {{learned more}} {{language}} she gradually included more grammatical complexity in her speech during everyday interactions, {{and began to}} apply her language to more everyday situations. In late 1973 she startled linguists when she gave a monologue consisting {{of a series of}} short utterances to a small group of familiar adults, which was much longer than any of her previously recorded speech; while she only used grammar she had fully mastered <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be using different words to try to express herself, which Curtiss thought was a sort of free association, making it the closest she came to attempting any language experimentation. Genie subsequently spoke at this length on a few more occasions, always in the same manner and on similar topics. She also began to use language to describe fictional events, describing some of fantasies in language as early as January 1973 and attempting on at least two occasions in 1974 and 1975 to lie.|$|E
500|$|As Hannah's fourth {{pregnancy}} progressed, zookeepers noticed <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be less agitated {{than previous}} pregnancies and attributed this {{to their new}} quarters: during her previous three pregnancies, Hannah {{had lived in the}} zoo's lion house, a stressful environment for a pregnant hippo. [...] On Mother's Day of 1938, Hannah gave birth to a healthy baby.|$|E

500|$|... "Miss Millie," [...] {{always a}} {{champion}} of southern traditions, was a woman of powerful personality, commanding presence, and fearlessly outspoken opinions; she was known widely for the speeches she delivered in hoop skirts. For all her decorum, <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> enjoy the protracted battles over the plaster goats that stood {{at the end of}} the dormitory's long veranda. The college boys periodically painted these animals in their school colors, red and black. At last they were broken when the boys attempted to hide them; some of the former belles of Lucy Cobb still cherish pieces of the goats as souvenirs.|$|E
500|$|In March 1810, {{he married}} the 19-year old Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, {{and a great}} niece of Marie Antoinette by proxy; thus he had married into a German royal and {{imperial}} family. [...] Louise was less than happy with the arrangement, at least at first, stating [...] "Just to see the man {{would be the worst}} form of torture". [...] Her great-aunt had been executed in France, while Napoleon had fought numerous campaigns against Austria all throughout his military career. [...] However, <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> warm up to him over time. [...] After her wedding, she wrote to her father [...] "He loves me very much. I respond to his love sincerely. There is something very fetching and very eager about him that is impossible to resist".|$|E
500|$|Lorna Cooper a {{columnist}} of website MSN TV, branded Jane and Des one of [...] "TV's gruesome twosomes". She has listed Jane {{as one of}} Soap Opera's forgotten characters, claiming her as a favourite out of the golden era of Neighbours. Cooper once described her as [...] "Seemingly mousey girl, who turned into a heartbreaker" [...] and opines that <b>she</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have liking for a [...] "succession of older men". Jane is referred to in Emily Barr's fictitious novel [...] "Out of My Depth", in which character Amanda is watching her on [...] Neighbours. Jane is mentioned in radio presenter Tony Horne tour guide book [...] "Hornes Down Under" [...] in which he states he was not excited about visiting the set of Neighbours because in his opinion nothing good happened after the departures of Jane and Mike.|$|E
