50|$|Formerly, {{the upper}} reaches of the East and West Manych were connected, at least in wet years or seasons. The Kalaus River, when {{reaching}} the thalweg of the Kuma-Manych Depression at , would split: the left distributary, flowing north and then west, toward Lake Manych-Gudilo, would become the source of the West Manych, while the right distributary, flowing south and then east, would become the headwaters of the East Manych. During the 20th century, most of the water went into the eastern distributary, until it was dammed. Later, a <b>solid</b> <b>dam</b> was built at this point, preventing any water from flowing from the Kalaus into the East Manych, thus making the Kalaus the source of only the West Manych.|$|E

50|$|A {{study done}} by Rijkswaterstaat in 1937 {{showed that the}} sea {{defenses}} in the southwest river delta were inadequate to withstand a major storm surge. The proposed solution was to dam all the river mouths and sea inlets thereby shortening the coast. However, because of the scale of this project and {{the intervention of the}} Second World War its construction was delayed and the first works were only completed in 1950. The North Sea flood of 1953 gave a major impulse to speed up the project. In the following years a number of dams were built to close off the estuary mouths. In 1976, under pressures from environmental groups and the fishing industry, it was decided not to close off the Oosterschelde estuary by a <b>solid</b> <b>dam</b> but instead to build the Oosterscheldekering, a storm surge barrier which is only closed during storms. It is the most well-known (and most expensive) dam of the project. A second major hurdle for the works was in the Rijnmond area. A storm surge through the Nieuwe Waterweg would threaten about 1.5 million people around Rotterdam. However, closing off this river mouth would be very detrimental for the Dutch economy, as the Port of Rotterdam—one of the biggest sea ports in the world—uses this river mouth. Eventually, the Maeslantkering was built in 1997, keeping economical factors in mind: the Maeslantkering is a set of two swinging doors that can shut off the river mouth when necessary, but which are usually open. The Maeslantkering is forecast to close about once per decade. Up until January 2012, it has closed only once, in 2007. The project was finished with the construction of the Maeslantkering in 1997.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} old dams in Sweden and, since few dams are {{constructed}} today, the main task in risk assessment {{on the existing}} dams is often {{to reduce the risk}} of failure. RIDAS (Swedish Guidelines on Dam Safety) is used when designing new dams and assess the existing ones. The guidelines include stability requirements for different failure modes, e. g. overturning and sliding, which imply that the load effect from e. g. uplift and ice load need to be less than the resisting loads or moments. The ice load in RIDAS is given as a deter­ministic value depending on where in Sweden the dam is located. For many years, ice and ice load have been researched, but there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the magni­tude of the ice load and how it affects the probability of failure for dams. More knowledge about the actual ice load would result in a lower calculated probability of failure for the dam which could be used to design slender dams or avoid unnecessary reinforcement of existing dams. Dam safety evaluation is often performed with deterministic methods based on safety factors. In recent years, the use of probabilistic methods in dam design has increased. The method has an advantage compared to deterministic methods in safety evaluations of existing dams, since probabilistic methods provide an answer to which parameters that have the greatest impact on the stability of the dam and take into account the variations in each parameter. I this master thesis, a statistical distribution for the variation of the ice load’s annual maxi­mum value was calculated. This was used in the analysis of the probability of failure for <b>solid</b> gravity concrete <b>dams</b> and buttress concrete dams. The probability of failure was cal­culated for dams of different sizes for overturning and sliding failure modes, and also for three different load cases; without ice load, with a truncated ice load distribution and with an ice load distribution that has not been truncated. The probabilistic stability analysis was conducted in Comrel with ice load as one of the stochastic variables. It was found which sizes of the dams that have the largest impact from the ice load; also what effect extreme values on the ice load has on the failure probability of the dam. The results indicated that the probability of failure for dams lower than 15 m is more affected by the ice load, for both failure modes analyzed. The probability of failure is reduced for all dam types when eliminating extreme values of the ice load, particularly for dams lower than 15 m. In several cases, truncation of the ice load distribution is the differ­ence between an accepted and a non-accepted level of the probability of failure. It is also shown that reduced coefficient of variance for the ice load results in a decreased probability of failure. The conclusion is that <b>solid</b> gravity <b>dams</b> and buttress dams lower than 15 m, with a high consequence class, should be risk assessed with the ice load as a stochastic vari­able. The statistical distribution of the ice load is still uncertain and the distribution used in this report should not be used globally, rather in areas with a climate similar to northern Sweden. The reason for this is that the measurements that were used to derive the global distribution were mainly performed in areas with conditions similar to those in northern Sweden. A recommendation for further research is to focus on determining statistical distributions for the ice load for southern, central and northern Sweden. An alternative is to use differ­ent ice load distributions for the different areas. Another alternative could be to use the same statistical distribution for southern, central and northern Sweden but with different values for where the ice load distribution is truncated, depending on the maximal ice thick­ness in each area. The recommendation is also to develop a reliable method for measuring the ice load. In addition, attempts should be made to determine whether extreme values on the ice load really exist or if they are effects of measurement errors.

40|$|The {{existence}} of suspended <b>solids</b> at Hitotsuse <b>dam,</b> Miyazaki Prefecture, Kyushu, Japan, {{has been the}} main concern of Kyushu Electric Power Company. These have been carried by rivers flowing into the dam. In a long term, it is worried that this phenomenon will potentially cause the environmental degradation, especially around the dam, where the Kyushu Electric Power Plant is located. Therefore, necessary measures are required to protect the dam from environmental degradation, which in return is to assure its long term power plant operational. Preliminary studies found that the suspended solid, which was generated upstreams and was carried out into the dam by rivers, causes the turbid water resident. Therefore, evaluation on the potential sources of the {{existence of}} the suspended solids needs to be carried out. In this research, analysis was conducted to understand the spatial distribution and the quantity of the suspended solid. For this purpose, by focusing attention on the upper river basin of reservoir, several factors which are possible to cause turbid water are extracted and analyzed quantitatively by using GIS. To understand the characteristic of the river turbidity, river flows and river turbidity are measured at several selected stations. Then mechanical factors causing turbid water are identified after analyzing relationship between efflux characteristics and possible factors of suspended solids. The results show that spatial information extraction could be done efficiently by applying spatial analysis method. Furthermore, by applying multiple regression analysis, it was found that landslide scars, artificial forests, drainage area, and terrain undulation are indicated as the dominant factors causing the turbidity...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The Cottage Grove Reservoir {{has been}} {{impacted}} by a point source (Black Butte Mine), where mercury mining and processing has occurred within its watershed from the 1890 's {{to the late}} 1960 's. Total mercury concentrations in surface sediments transect samples, core samples, tributary samples, and representative food web species were measured in 2002. Mercury stratigraphy in reservoir sediment cores and tributary surficial sediments from 2002 and 1995 (unpublished data) were compared and contrasted, core dating was performed to estimate sediment deposition rates and long-term trends for mercury accumulation, and mercury contamination in low trophic levels was assessed. Mercury concentrations in tributary stream sediments strongly correlate with its upstream or downstream proximity to the mine. Current results strongly suggest that the mine area is a continuing source of mercury to downstream tributaries with a strong concentration gradient from {{the area of the}} mine to the headwaters of the Coast Fork of the Willamette River. Mercury concentrations in surface sediment transects gradually increase from locations near the inlet to the dam, suggesting an increased mercury deposition rate as suspended <b>solids</b> approach the <b>dam.</b> Sediment cores from both time periods were collected from the deepest most stable region of the reservoir which is likely to have the highest sediment accumulation rates. Mercury concentrations from both cores increase from the surface {{to the bottom of the}} core. Core dating results indicate that approximately 40 years lapsed before mercury input to the reservoir stabilized and mercury input has remained relatively stable over the last 20 years. In an aquatic foodweb, methylmercury is the most important form of mercury because it is highly bioavailable for uptake into aquatic organisms. Bioaccumulation of mercury into aquatic organisms can occur through multiple pathways including uptake from sediment arid water, through the skin or cuticle, ventilation of gills, or consumption of contaminated sediment or prey. Biomagnification of methylmercury occurs at successively higher trophic levels of a foodweb. Total mercury concentrations were measured in organisms representative three trophic levels including benthic invertebrates, omnivorous/herbivorous amphibians and fish, and piscivorous fish. Mercury concentrations measured in benthic invertebrates (concentrations ranged from 0. 035 mg/kg to 0. 075 mg/kg wet-weight) and omnivorous/herbivorous amphibians and fish (concentrations ranged from less than 0. 02 mg/kg to 0. 043 mg/kg wet-weight) suggest little biomagnification has occurred at these trophic levels. Mercury concentrations in epaxial muscle of largemouth bass (concentrations ranged from 0. 86 mg/kg to 1. 6 mg/kg wet-weight) are at levels of concern for human health, and fish consumption advisories are posted at the Reservoir. Food web results indicate that significant biomagnification is occurring at higher trophic levels within the foodweb. Current studies suggest that elevated mercury concentrations in largemouth bass are strongly linked to the life history characteristics of the fish...|$|R
