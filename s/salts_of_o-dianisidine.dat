40|$|AbstractA {{total of}} 11 {{manganese}} peroxidase isoenzymes (MnP 1 -MnP 11) with isoelectric points (pIs) {{in the range}} of 4. 58 – 3. 20 were isolated from liquid- and solid-state cultures of the basidiomycete Ceriporiopsis subvermispora. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, these isoenzymes showed different requirements for Mn(II) in the oxidation <b>of</b> vanillylacetone, <b>o-dianisidine,</b> p-anisidine and ABTS, whereas oxidation of guaiacol by any isoenzyme did not take place when this metal was omitted. Km values for o-dianisidine and p-anisidine in the absence of Mn(II) are {{in the range of}} 0. 5 – 1. 0 mM and 4. 5 – 42. 0 mM, respectively. Oxalate and citrate, but not tartrate, accelerate the oxidation <b>of</b> <b>o-dianisidine,</b> both in the presence {{and in the absence of}} Mn(II).

40|$|The {{exploration}} of functional group interactions and electro-generated species stabilization on chemically modified electrodes for efficient electro-analytical application {{is a continuing}} research area in electrochemistry. In addition, the electrochemical behaviours of the intermediate species, which are generated from the aromatic organic redox mediator and possess both methoxy and amine functional groups, have been rarely studied for electro-analytical applications. For the first time, we report the stabilization of an electro-generated enone derivative <b>of</b> the <b>o-dianisidine</b> (EDo-D) dimer formed {{as one of the}} intermediate species during o-dianisidine immobilization. The electro-generated o-dianisidine derivative (o-DD) -stabilized multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) -modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE/o-DD@MWCNT) exhibited two highly reproducible and, well-defined surface-confined redox couples in a pH 7 phosphate buffer solution (PBS). FTIR analyses indicated the presence of an amine group linkage and an azo product in the o-DD@MWCNT hybrid. UV-Vis and GC-MS analyses confirmed the presence <b>of</b> <b>o-dianisidine</b> in its azo dimer form within the MWCNT. In addition, the enone derivative <b>of</b> the <b>o-dianisidine</b> dimer present on the GCE/o-DD@MWCNT successfully sensed gallic acid (GA) at 0. 16 V vs. Ag/AgCl in pH 7 PBS. Highly selective GA detection was achieved with a sensitivity of 0. 4580 µA µM- 1, a detection range of 100 - 1300 µM and a detection limit of 144 nM using chronoamperometry. GCE/o-DD@MWCNT also demonstrated effective GA detection in simulated real grape juice and water samples...|$|R

40|$|Rat brain {{polymorphonuclear}} infiltration was quantitated by {{spectrophotometric assay}} of myeloperoxidase activity. Peroxidase was assayed {{by following the}} oxidation <b>of</b> <b>o-dianisidine</b> {{in the presence of}} a hydrogen peroxide generating system (glucose-glucose oxidase). Enzyme activity was proportional to the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes present at densities between 105 and 106 cells. Brain tissue did not have detectable peroxidase activity and polymorphonuclear leukocytes added to brain homogenates were quantitatively estimated. In infant rats with Haemophilus influenzae meningitis, the correlation between the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes found in brain by peroxidase activity measurement and independent histological grading was not precise, but there was an exact correlation in predicting presence or absence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

40|$|The {{influence}} of phenol and its derivatives on the kinetics of oxidation of aryldiamines (indicator-substrates) catalyzed by novel plant peroxidase—cationic peanut peroxidase—was studied. The character of {{influence of}} phenols on the kinetics of enzymatic oxidation <b>of</b> benzidine, <b>o-dianisidine,</b> and 3, 3, 5, 5 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) with hydrogen peroxide {{was found to}} depend on a correlation between redox properties of phenols and the indicator-sub-strate of peroxidase.

40|$|Abstract: Mercury(II) in {{the range}} of 0. 1 – 1 mg L 21 {{concentrations}} was found to be a much more efficient inhibitor of native peanut peroxidase (PNP) than of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the reaction <b>of</b> <b>o-dianisidine</b> oxidation with hydrogen peroxide. The possible reason for the different degree of mercury(II) effects on the catalytic activity of both enzymes was studied. It was shown that the different number of glycans in PNP and HRP molecules (three and eight, respectively), or their absence in the molecule of wild-type recombinant horseradish peroxidase refolded from E. coli inclusion bodies (recHRP), does not {{play a significant role in}} the effects caused by mercury(II). The efficient inhibition of PNP by mercury(II) in the absence of any other additives (for example, thiourea) originates from a greater mobility of the distal calcium ion in the enzyme molecule. A model scheme for the interaction of the studied plant peroxidases with mercury(II) was proposed. The PNP-based enzymatic method for mercury(II) determination with cmin 0. 04 mg L 2...|$|R

40|$|What are {{potassium}} <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> {{fatty acids}}? Potassium <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> fatty acids are commonly called soap salts. They {{are used as}} insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and algaecides. The first pesticide product containing soap salts was registered for use in 1947 (1). Potassium <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> fatty acids are produced by adding potassium hydroxide to fatty acids found in animal fats and in plant oils. Fatty acids are extracted from palm, coconut, olive, castor, and cottonseed plants to form this active ingredient (2). Soap salts are derived from fatty acids with carbon chain lengths of 12 - 18 saturated carbons, and chain lengths of 18 carbons {{with one or more}} double bonds (unsaturated). Potassium salts may include oleate, laureate, myristate, and ricinoleate (1). Some potassium <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> fatty acids are used as multi-purpose food additives. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies them as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) (3). Residues from the use of this active ingredient, in accordance with labeling guidelines, are not anticipated to exceed levels that occur naturally, or levels that are intentionally added to food. Potassium <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> fatty acids have been exempt from United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tolerances for food and feed crops since 1982 (1, 4).
