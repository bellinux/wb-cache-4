The large, mature leaves contained 42 % more total oxalate than in the small leaves and the soluble oxalate content of the large leaves was 33 % higher than the smaller leaves. Cooking the mixed leaves, <b>stems</b> <b>and</b> <b>buds</b> in boiling water for two minutes significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced the total oxalate {{when compared to the}} raw plant parts.

Soup made from mixed leaves contained lower levels of total oxalates (44. 26 ± 0. 49 mg total oxalate/ 100 g fresh weight) and insoluble oxalate made up 49 % of the oxalate contents. The levels of oxalates in the Good-King-Henry leaves were high, suggesting that the leaves should be consumed occasionally as a delicacy because of their unique taste rather than as {{a significant part of the}} diet.

50|$|Powdery Mildew {{thrives in}} warm, moist environments and infects younger plant tissues like fruit, leaves, <b>and</b> green <b>stems</b> <b>and</b> <b>buds.</b> Free water can disrupt conidia and only {{requires}} a humid microclimate for infection. Most infection begins when spring rain (2.5mm) falls and temperatures are approximately 15°C or higher. Rates of infection decline at temperatures higher than 30°C, since the evaporation of water occurs readily. Cooler conditions, such as shading and poor aeration, promote infection {{due to a}} higher relative humidity, optimally 85% or greater. However, sporulation does occur at levels as low as 40%.

Browse (leaves, <b>stems,</b> <b>and</b> <b>buds</b> of woody plants) is generally available all year and is a staple food for deer. Breeding occurs from October to January depending on latitude. Deer damage a wide variety of row crops, forage crops, vegetables, fruit trees, nursery stock, and ornamentals, as well as stacked hay.

Fabaceae, Melastomataceae, Myrtaceae, and Asteraceae were the plant families with the greatest richness of galls, with 20, 18, 17, and 12 gall morphotypes, respectively. The super host genera were Copaifera L. (Fabaceae), Myrcia DC. ex. Guill. (Myrtaceae), and Miconia Ruiz & Pav. (Melastomataceae), with 10, 10 and 09 gall morphotypes, respectively. The super host species was Copaifera cf. langsdorfii Desf. (Fabaceae), with 10 gall morphotypes. Galls were found on leaves, <b>stems,</b> <b>buds,</b> <b>and</b> aerial roots.
