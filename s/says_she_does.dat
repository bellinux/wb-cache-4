Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), observing Gabe's pitiful attempts, tries to imply that Val does not feel the same way, but to no avail.

5|$|If {{the player}} instead waits, the cabin gets transported to Aosagi Island. Yomogi, Mayuzumi, and Cocoro avoid the {{avalanche}} that was {{mentioned in the}} newspaper. The Yuni from 2011 is left at Akakura to be rescued by the rescue team in 2011, and to go to SPHIA in 2012 to repeat the loop, making sure that Cocoro, Yomogi, and Mayuzumi survive the week. Satoru reviews his theory regarding Inubushi; he thinks that she, too, was experiencing the transfer phenomenon, and that her consciousness ended up at Mount Akakura in the dying body of Hotori. He thinks the consciousness of Hotori inhabited Inubushi's body, rendering it free of homicidal tendencies, but realizes that since both his and Inubushi's consciousnesses remain at the island, Hotori cannot occupy Inubushi's body when he occupies his; Cocoro runs towards Inubushi, who is holding Utsumi's infant child {{over the edge of}} a cliff while singing. The game ends with Satoru meeting Mayuzumi, who <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not recognize him.|$|E
5|$|Robin (Cobie Smulders) {{suggests}} Ted {{give up on}} Stella {{and instead}} focus on Abby. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) agrees, as he made an appointment with Stella to check what she was like, and discovered she had a condition where she is only attracted to men with mustaches. Although Ted does not believe him, he still tries to grow a mustache, which Stella laughs at (a year earlier, Barney had made a ten-dollar bet with Ted {{that he could get}} him to grow a mustache). Upset, Ted says he gives up, but Lily (Alyson Hannigan) tells him to try again, as Stella is interested in him, though she says she has not been to see her. It is then revealed that Marshall (Jason Segel) had gone to see Stella to talk up Ted, and found out Stella had a crush on him. The book ended up belonging to Marshall. Happy that Stella is interested in him, Ted asks her out after his last session, but she <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not have time for dating because she has a daughter.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in the season, Cliff had J.R. {{facing a}} {{financial}} mess, when J.R.'s plan to blackmail the Farlows into handing over John Ross, by stockpiling 5 {{million barrels of}} the Farlows' crude oil, backfired on J.R., when the market {{price of crude oil}} started to fall and fall. In order to stockpile the Farlows' crude oil, J.R. had taken out a $200,000,000 loan and used $50,000,000 worth of Ewing Oil assets as collateral. Cliff, along with Jordan Lee, Andy Bradley and Wade Luce, then worked with Vaughn Leland in order to buy into the notes owed by J.R., and they planned to foreclose. With Cliff seemingly putting one over on J.R., Miss Ellie bailed Ewing Oil out of this mess by agreeing to a deal with Clayton that Clayton would pay the price that he would have paid {{at the time that the}} oil was stockpiled. By the season's end, J.R. and Cliff's situations had turned sharply in the opposite direction, as Sue Ellen, with whom Cliff had had an off-and-on relationship, decided to return to J.R., planning to marry him again. In addition, J.R. had set a trap for Cliff by making sure that a fake geological report would convince Cliff to invest millions of dollars in buying property on supposedly oil rich land which was actually bone dry. Cliff was then fired by his mother from running Wentworth Tool & Die, due to Cliff's embezzlement of company funds. Cliff attempts suicide with an overdose of pills, and a guilt-ridden Sue Ellen rushes to his bedside as Cliff lies in a coma. J.R. tries to convince Sue Ellen that it was not anybody's fault but Cliff's for what happened, but Sue Ellen disagrees and <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not know if she can remarry J.R. if Cliff dies. Cliff's life hangs in the balance as the season ends.|$|E

On 26 July 2002, the 50th anniversary of Eva Perón's death, a museum opened in her honor called Museo Evita.

Willow changes her shirt again and Xander expresses his desire to find Glory and exact justice, then complains about Joyce's negligent doctors.
