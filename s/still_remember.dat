25|$|The {{original}} {{short story}} {{was set in}} the 1960s and dealt with characters nostalgic for their childhoods in the Midwestern United States in the 1920s. In the Chronicles version, which takes place forty years later but which still relies on 1920s nostalgia, the story contains a brief paragraph about medical treatments that slow the aging process, so that the characters can be traveling to Mars in the 2000s but <b>still</b> <b>remember</b> the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|With the {{industrial}} base of Britain being {{so dependent on}} its railway system, the viaduct was considered a strategic target by the Germans. Local people <b>still</b> <b>remember</b> the many attempts made by the Luftwaffe to destroy the viaduct. Had they succeeded, it would have severed the arterial link {{into and out of}} the West London industrial estates for many weeks – if not months. All raids, however, fell wide of their mark or the bombs failed to explode.|$|E

25|$|The play The Sound of the People Victorious (Ludu Aungthan) that U Nu wrote {{while he}} was Prime Minister is about the havoc that Communist {{ideologies}} can wreak in a family. Strangely enough the first production of the play {{seems to have been}} in Pasadena, California. It later became a popular comic book in Burma, was translated into English, and made into a feature film {{at the height of the}} Cold War in the 1950s. The older generation in Burma can <b>still</b> <b>remember</b> having studied the play in their schooldays.|$|E
25|$|The {{prospect}} of memory erasure or alteration raises ethical issues. Some of these concern identity, as memory seems {{to play a}} role in how people perceive themselves. For example, if a traumatic memory were erased, a person might <b>still</b> <b>remember</b> related events in their lives, such as their emotional reactions to later experiences. Without the original memory to give them context, these remembered events might prompt the subjects to see themselves as emotional or irrational people. In the United States, the President's Council on Bioethics devoted a chapter in its October 2003 report Beyond Therapy to the issue. The report discourages the use of drugs that blunt the effect of traumatic memories, warning against treating human emotional reactions to life events as a medical issue.|$|E
25|$|At Briarcliff, Sister Jude (Jessica Lange) takes Lana's secret {{notes about}} the asylum. Lana retorts {{that she can}} <b>still</b> <b>remember</b> what has {{happened}} to her, prompting Sister Jude to ask Dr. Arden (James Cromwell) to give Lana electroshock treatment. Asked to assist in administering the electroshock, Sister Jude is disturbed by the violence of the resulting treatment. In the woods, Sister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe) asks Dr. Arden to tell her the identity of the creatures in the woods who savagely eat the meat she prepares for them. Later, Shelley (Chloë Sevigny) offers herself to Dr. Arden in return for fifteen minutes outside. He rebuffs her, calling her a slut and a whore, leading Shelley to argue that women face a double standard with their sexuality, and that she was committed by her promiscuous husband who hypocritically forbade her from engaging in extramarital sex.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} Dark Signer-like figures (called Shadow Drones in the dub) who are {{recruited}} {{and controlled by}} Roman's spiders. They only have access to Dark Tuner and Dark Synchro Monsters. When these Shadow Drones are defeated, their Mark of the Shadows and Deck disappear, and they lose their memories of being possessed. According to Goodwin, a true Dark Signer cannot be returned to normal, because they have already died. In addition, their duels end with the losing duelist being killed (in the dub, the loser {{is sent to the}} Netherworld). When a true Dark Signer is defeated, all the souls that were used for summoning their Earthbound Immortal are freed (this also seems to apply to non-Dark Signers who were defeated in Shadow Duels). After Goodwin and the King of the Netherworld are defeated, Goodwin and Roman pass on to the afterlife while Carly, Misty, and Devack are revived with no memory of their time as Dark Signers. Kalin is later shown to <b>still</b> <b>remember</b> his time as a Dark Signer, as well as Greiger. It is speculated that they kept their memories because, unlike the others, they willingly became Dark Signers.|$|E

Its diet appears to have consisted mainly of insects found in grass, and it occasionally fed on copra (coconut meat). Its broken colour pattern was said to make it blend well with its surroundings, and it lacked [...] "shyness".|$|E
