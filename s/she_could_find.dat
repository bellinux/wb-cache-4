5|$|On 5 April 1809, {{about three}} months before the family's move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, {{offering}} him a new manuscript of Susan if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel, and requesting the return of the original so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.|$|E
5|$|Rita {{takes her}} {{children}} Astor (Christina Robinson) and Cody (Preston Bailey) to see Paul (Mark Pellegrino) in prison. He {{insists that he}} was framed by Dexter—that Dexter dragged him out of Rita's house before drugging him and tipping off the police—and that if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> his missing shoe it would prove his innocence. Rita tells him {{that there is no}} shoe, despite having found it over a month ago. She later admits that she found the shoe, but refuses to acknowledge that Dexter is involved. That night, she receives a call from Paul's prison and learns that he was killed in an inmate altercation.|$|E
25|$|Princess Galyani Vadhana {{had liked}} {{reading and writing}} from an early age. While {{studying}} Prathom 1 to Prathom 3, she read as many Thai language books as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> However, children’s books in Thai were then rare so she often read the newspaper. She remembered once reading {{a story in the}} original French—the 1878 novel Sans Famille—while studying in Switzerland, which she later found again.|$|E

Guðrún went into the forest to search for what was left by the wolves and found Sigurd.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{mishandling}} {{the sales}} with Philip Green, Sir Alan felt that Ruth {{was not to}} blame for the loss as she had been the top seller on her team, criticising Michelle for bringing her back when both her errors and those of Sam outweighed Ruth's single mistake. However, Michelle said she had even less reason to bring Ansell in, since both he and Ruth had sold well, and that Ruth's handling of Green was the sole fault <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> in either performance.|$|E
25|$|From her {{internment}} camp, she smuggled {{a letter}} to her mother, requesting for her children {{to be sent to}} her. This Nor Louise did, but Maria was not among them. So Mrs. Hertogh asked her mother to fetch Maria from Aminah. Her mother later wrote and told her that Aminah wanted to keep Maria for two more days, after which she herself would bring the child to the camp. This did not materialise and Mrs. Hertogh did not see Maria throughout her internment. After her release, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> neither Maria nor Aminah.|$|E

25|$|Catherine {{believed}} in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose power depended on letters as well as arms, and she {{was familiar with the}} writing of Erasmus, among others, on the subject. She enjoyed and collected books, and moved the royal collection to the Louvre, her principal residence. She delighted in the company of learned men and women, and her court was highly literary. Her government officials, such as secretary-of-state Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy, whose wife translated the epistles of Ovid, were perfectly at home in literary circles. When <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> the time, Catherine occasionally wrote verses herself, which she would show to the court poets. Her reading was not entirely highbrow, however. A superstitious woman, she believed implicitly in astrology and soothsaying, and her reading matter included The Book of Sibyls and the almanacs of Nostradamus.|$|E
25|$|A {{native of}} Everett, Massachusetts, English was the {{daughter}} of Ambrose Tobias English, a pipe-fitter and longtime Everett city official, and Anna (née Henneberry) English. Her older brother, Edward, was a high school star third baseman who saw his professional baseball dreams truncated by military service during wartime. She attended parochial grammar schools and graduated from Everett High School, and was a competent athlete in any sport <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> to play. Although there were no organized girls interscholastic sports, English began participating in pickup softball games at age ten on Boston area playgrounds. In 1939 she joined a Massachusetts 14-year-old softball team, which competed against opponents from Connecticut and New York in summer exhibitions. Like her brother, she played at third base and had a strong throwing arm. English and her Bay State teammates were coached by some players of the Boston Bruins hockey team, and they played their home games on the concrete floor of the Boston Garden when the Bruins and the Boston Celtics basketball team were out of the town.|$|E
500|$|Although neither Bernard nor her {{publisher}} was {{enthusiastic about}} her choice, Brodie {{began to work}} on her new project. She resigned her professorship at UCLA in 1977 to devote herself to research, including, for the first time, in oral history collections. [...] Brodie conducted 150 interviews. [...] She tried unsuccessfully to interview Henry Kissinger, whom she knew on a first-name basis—-and Nixon for what she described {{in a letter to}} him as “a compassionate and accurate study.” (Nixon did not reply.) Though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> no evidence, Brodie began to think that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship with his good friend Bebe Rebozo. Her psychoanalyst friends tried to warn her off this topic.|$|E

500|$|Jayma Mays commented {{of their}} relationship: [...] "Oh no! I don’t know if I can say! That’s a hard {{question}} {{because when you}} see the scenes of Emma and Will, you obviously think 'Oh of course they’re supposed to be together, of course, of course!' but the fact is, is that he’s a married man and Emma knows that’s wrong, and she doesn’t want to be a homewrecker. She doesn’t want to ruin a relationship. So I guess in a perfect world, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can become a little bit more like Will. But maybe it’s all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love." [...] She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): [...] "We were friends. We knew each other before we started this job. We worked together once before. So, that’s always helpful when you know the person that you’re working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he’s a really good friend, so that makes that stuff a little bit easier." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 13, Saldívar went to {{her lawyer}} and wrote her resignation, which Quintanilla, Jr. {{believed}} was her alibi. The same day, Saldívar drove to Corpus Christi and checked into the Sand and Sea Motel. Selena was in Miami, Florida, at the time. Quintanilla, Jr. believed {{this would have been}} the first attempt to kill Selena. When Selena arrived in Corpus Christi on March 14, Saldívar contacted her to schedule a meeting. Saldívar told Selena there was too much traffic and asked her to meet her at a parking lot twenty-five miles (40 km) away from Corpus Christi. Upon arriving, Selena told Saldívar she could remain in charge of her business affairs in Mexico. According to Quintanilla, Jr. Selena wanted to continue employing Saldívar until <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> a replacement. Saldívar showed Selena the gun she had bought; Selena told her to [...] "get rid of it" [...] and said she would protect Saldívar from her father, according to Saldívar and Pérez. This, Quintanilla, Jr. believed, had calmed Saldívar and was the reason she did not kill Selena in the parking lot. The next day, Saldívar returned the gun to the shop saying her father had given her a [...]22-caliber pistol. On March 26, Saldívar stole a perfume sample and more bank statements from Selena in Mexico.|$|E
