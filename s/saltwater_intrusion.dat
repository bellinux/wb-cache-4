After President Herbert Hoover's visit to the area in February 1929, the Corps drafted a new plan which provided for the construction of floodway channels, control gates, and major levees along Lake Okeechobee's shores. A long term system was designed for the purpose of flood control, water conservation, prevention of <b>saltwater</b> <b>intrusion,</b> and preservation of fish and wildlife populations.

5|$|As {{a result}} of efforts to control water {{resources}} in Florida and projects to drain the Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to <b>saltwater</b> <b>intrusion</b> into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of {{water out of the}} southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.|$|E
30|$|These {{preliminary}} lessons {{have been}} {{derived from the}} views of outside stakeholders involved in facilitating the relocation, not the affected community themselves, which very much warrants further investigation. The original Vunidogoloa village consisted of 26 houses and was located only a few meters from the coast on Vanua Levu {{in the northern part}} of the country. Over time, the community became consistently inundated and trapped when heavy rains combined with high tides (Pacific Conference of Churches 2012). Despite the houses being built on stilts, flood waters still reached the ground floors and caused damage each time the village was inundated. Growing and sustaining local community gardens also became increasingly difficult to maintain due to the <b>saltwater</b> <b>intrusions.</b> In an initial attempt to mitigate the <b>saltwater</b> <b>intrusions</b> and protect the community, a seawall was constructed, however, over time this barrier became ineffective.|$|R

30|$|Natural estuarine {{processes}} are impacted by {{factors such as}} global temperature increase, sea level rise, <b>saltwater</b> <b>intrusions</b> and pollution, so that the ability of estuarine organisms to adapt to these changes can be sharply weakened. <b>Saltwater</b> <b>intrusions</b> are a basic characteristic of estuarine environments. With the rapid industrialization and urbanization of coastal areas, many estuaries are exposed to serious pollution, such as heavy metals, oils, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and nutrients (Nelson et al. 1977; Sousa et al. 2008). The deterioration of water quality associated with these pollutants causes the destruction of estuarine habitats, leading {{to a reduction in}} biodiversity and the decline of fisheries resources. The majority of aquatic species do not have the ability to adapt to these environmental disturbances. To further our knowledge of these dynamic environments, it is necessary to select a type species that responds well to the variable processes and {{that can be used to}} determine levels of organic pollutants from both water and sediment.|$|R

On Yap, the typhoon produced sustained winds of 56km/h (35mph), with gusts to 141km/h (87mph). The winds also caused an islandwide power outage that lasted for about two days, and damaged {{the roof of the}} Yap International Airport terminal. High waves and storm surge damaged coastal structures and flooded areas up to 150m (500ft) inland. The seawall at the capital city of Colonia was damaged, and portions of the town were flooded 1.5m (5ft) deep. The storm destroyed over 150houses on Yap, leaving hundreds staying in shelters. Across the island, the winds knocked down trees onto roads, and <b>saltwater</b> <b>intrusion</b> caused severe crop damage; most of the taro and banana crops were destroyed.

Unemployment across Hatteras rose {{in the wake of}} the damage to local businesses, and many restaurants lost product when their refrigerators failed during the power outages. Residents piled debris from their damaged homes on roads, primarily Highway 12, and workers responded by clearing the debris. The highway was speedily reopened and repaired at a cost of around $1million. Within two weeks of the storm, businesses resumed as cleaning work was under way, and the island was reopened to tourists. Clean-up operations in the region lasted weeks to months. In the three months after the storm, <b>saltwater</b> <b>intrusion</b> into the Cape Hatteras water supply boosted chlorine levels from 40milligrams (0.0014ounces) to 280milligrams (0.01ounces) per liter; it took another three months for the chlorine to decrease to normal concentrations.

40|$|The Saloum River hypersaline estuary (Senegal) is an ‘inverse estuary’ {{showing a}} {{salinity}} increasing {{from the river}} mouth towards inland. This salinization process is mainly driven by {{a net loss of}} freshwater due to intense evaporation. In this context, interactions between the river and the surrounding aquifer of the Continental Terminal (CT) may lead to local and progressive salinization of this groundwater main resource for water supply. Our study, based on available data and new measured data in 2012 and 2013, is focused on {{the southern part of the}} Saloum basin. It confirms that the groundwater resource is threatened by local <b>saltwater</b> <b>intrusions</b> in the vicinity of the Saloum River and along the western coastal part of the aquifer. For a long term water resources management, it is thus essential to predict the future evolution of this process in a context of increasing groundwater pumping rate together with climate variability and changes. A groundwater flow model is developed using MODFLOW. Starting from a conceptual steady-state situation corresponding to the CT aquifer state in 1973 before development of pumping, a transient calibration of the groundwater flow model is performed on data from 1974 to 2012. Despite the low number of measured data, the model can be considered as the current best assessment tool for future predictions. Using the particle tracking technique (MODPATH), a first assessment of the <b>saltwater</b> <b>intrusions</b> in the aquifer is simulated (neglecting the density effect on the hydraulic conductivity) confirming the measured data. Results, for an increased pumping of 20 % in 2050 combined with different climatic scenarios, are useful to assess how the <b>saltwater</b> <b>intrusions</b> will evolve in the next years.

50|$|Giant swamp taro {{is nearly}} the only {{carbohydrate}} crop {{that can be}} cultivated on low-lying coral atolls, where it is grown in purpose-built swamp pits dug to {{below the level of}} the freshwater lens. The cultivation of Pulaka in Tuvalu, and of babai in Kiribati, has deep cultural significance. In these harsh environments, its cultivation is increasingly threatened by rising sea levels caused by global warming: the plant does not thrive in brackish water, which rots the roots, turns the leaves yellow, and stunts the plant's growth. Climate change is affecting its cultivation in two ways; more frequent droughts increase the salinity of the freshwater lens, and more extreme high tides and coastal erosion lead to <b>saltwater</b> <b>intrusions</b> where seawater enters the cultivation pits.|$|R

The 2016 - 2021 master plan for water development and management of the Rhone-Mediterranean basin (SDAGE Rhône-Méditerranée) set the climate change adaptation as a new basic orientation of the water policy. For the local managers of water resources, this policy is difficult to implement because of a deficit of knowledge and methods. The Crau aquifer (550 km 2) supplies water for 300, 000 inhabitants, for major economic sectors and for agriculture. 70 % of the aquifer recharge depend on irrigated grasslands (14, 000 ha) with water derived from the Durance River. Located in coastal area, the south part of aquifer is sensitive to <b>saltwater</b> <b>intrusions,</b> which are mainly controlled by recharge conditions. But at medium term these recharge conditions could be affected by global changes, e. g. the decrease of water availability from the Durance River and the decrease of irrigated grassland surfaces due to urban sprawl. The local public manager of the Crau aquifer (SYMCRAU) has defined with the stakeholders an action plan ("contrat de nappe de la Crau") to anticipate global changes and propose adaptation solutions. Collaborations with research institutes have been developed to study global changes processes and better forecast their local impacts. A numerical model of surface drainages and groundwater flows allows quantifying the sensitivity of the resource to global changes. Special protection areas were identified to protect future of drinking water supply. Additional studies are scheduled to assess the impact of recharge decrease on <b>saltwater</b> <b>intrusions</b> and on wetland ecosystems. A project is planned to define the conditions for a sustainable adaption of irrigation practices to global changes.

We examined the role of historical salinity exposure on the survival of Gambusia affinis from two locations in coastal Louisiana. At each location, we sampled fish populations from fresh, intermediate and brackish marshes. Individuals were then exposed to a salinity of 25 ‰ and survival time was measured. We found that fish from brackish and intermediate marshes had an increased tolerance to salinity stress relative to fish from freshwater environments. We then tested the descendents of fish from the fresh and brackish marshes, reared for two generation in fresh water, {{to determine if there}} was a genetic basis for differential survival. We found that descendents of individuals from brackish marshes showed elevated survivals relative to the descendents of fish with no historical exposure to salinity.

30|$|Delineation of {{freshwater}} aquifer in coastal regions {{is of particular}} importance because {{of the influence of}} sea level change on groundwater salinity and/or migration of salt/brackish water intrusion into groundwater aquifers. Episodic changes in freshwater–saltwater interface levels in coastal groundwater are due to climatic variations, sea level fluctuations, decrease in recharge, and increase in groundwater pumping (Meisler et al. 1985; Barlow 2003). These factors impose hydrologic conditions that usually influence migration of saltwater from the sea toward boreholes in hydraulic connection with the sea, thereby reducing the natural gradient to the sea and make the freshwater–saltwater interface move inland (Buckley 2000; Buckley et al. 2001). Saltwater and freshwater–saltwater interface can be detected directly in drilled wells by electrical electrodes (downhole geophysical logging) and water sampling, or indirectly by electrical geophysical methods such as ground penetrating radar, surface geophysical resistivity (vertical electrical sounding) (Melloul and Goldenberg 1997). Both direct and indirect electrical geophysical techniques have been successfully used in evaluating coastal aquifer characteristics and monitoring of <b>saltwater</b> <b>intrusions</b> in groundwater studies because of the influence of salinity on electrical conductivity (sharp contrast in conductivity between freshwater and saltwater) (Archie 1942; Hallenburg 1987; Repsold 1989; Mares et al. 1994; Buckley 2000; Buckley et al. 2001).|$|R
