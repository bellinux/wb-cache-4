The test {{has been the}} subject of a European Standard prEN 1071 - 3 : 2000 established by the European Standards Committee CEN TC 184 WG 5. A previous European project on the development and validation of test methods for thin hard coatings [...] FASTE [...] revealed that uncertainties in the Rockwell C stylus tip shape represent a major source of error for the <b>scratch-test</b> method. Therefore a follow-up project [...] REMAST [...] was started to develop and certify a reference material as a quality control tool for the testing and qualification of <b>scratch-test</b> instruments. In addition, a considerable effort was devoted to improve the scratch stylus manufacturing process. This paper presents the results of the REMAST project. During a feasibility study, two candidate materials [...] titanium nitride (TiN) and diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings both on high speed steel substrates [...] were evaluated. Because of the lower sensitivity to styli tip shape variations and higher data scatter observed for the TiN coating, DLC was chosen as the reference material to be certified. One thousand samples were produced, as well as qualified styli to carry out the certification campaign, including homogeneity and stability testing. Nine independent laboratories were involved in the certification exercise, and the data were statistically analysed to obtain the certified critical load values and their uncertainty ranges. A certified reference material BCR- 692 is available for verification purposes. This presents three repeatable failure events at certified critical load intervals and can provide a good indication of overall <b>scratch-test</b> instrument performance, including stylus condition and calibration. It is also useful as a diagnostic tool, providing a means of sensitive monitoring of machine and stylus performance over extended periods. Considerable improvement of the quality of scratch styli was achieved by the strict control of all manufacturing steps. [URL]...|$|E

For example, we showed that this phenomenon is due to crack propagation occurring at the beginning of ageing. A finite element model has then been developed to study more accurately the propagation mode of these cracks. Thermal stresses are likely to propagate cracks through the film in pure opening mode. When cracks are long enough, thermal stresses can generate propagation parallel to the interface. This would result in the decrease of the measured adhesion with a possibility of flaking. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{deposition}} of protective transparent coatings on polycarbonate (PC) with higher scratch resistance {{than that of}} the polymeric substrate is performed using an original sol-gel system. Our strategy relies on the preparation of hybrid organic-inorganic (HOI) films using sol-gel based on 3 -glycidoxypropyltri-methoxysilane (GPTMS), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and zirconium(IV) propoxide (ZTP). We demonstrate that despite a low coating-to-PC adhesion (< 2 J m(- 2)), it is possible to maintain the coating integrity under high applied scratch forces when the organic domains of the film are highly connected. In this case, the increase in organic network connectivity was achieved through the reaction of epoxide rings in the presence of ZTP, as evidenced by FTIR. The subsequent additional plasticity of the coating led to an increase in <b>scratch-test</b> delamination force by more than twofold: from 1. 7 N for the hybrid film without ZTP to 3. 8 N with the highest degree of ZTP content. In regard to the inorganic network, an increasing number of Si-O-Zr and Zr-O-Zr bonds with increasing ZTP content were evidenced by FTIR and O- 17 MAS NMR, allowing improved hydrolysis resistance, and therefore more durable coatings. Altogether, these results demonstrate the key role played by ZTP in tuning the mechanical properties and durability of HOI coating without requiring adhesion-promoting treatments...|$|E

40|$|Authors want {{to thank}} Stéphane Benayoun, LTDS Lyon, for his help in <b>scratch-test</b> {{experimentation}} and for fruitful discussions. The scratching technique has gained interest in recent times because of the numerous inherent properties implied (adherence, hardness, elasticity, visco-elasticity, cohesion, etc.) during tests. Some singular mechanical responses have been noticed (cyclical slips and unsticking, degradation modes, etc.) and valued on multilayers polymeric coatings. The results allow differentiating them and illustrating the mare resistance for part. Scratch test is identified {{as one of the}} most efficient to build coating performance maps. The main purpose of our work related to the characterization of multilayers polymeric coatings, is to determine a set of experiments in order to compare their mar resistance. Experiments are made by indentation (hardness, creep, stress relaxation), scratch test (determination of the critical load), glossy reflection and wear. In this paper we describe the scratch experiments used to compare the mar resistance of the coatings. The parameters recorded are used to build a performance map relative to a specimen and this performance map is used to compare all characteristics of different multilayers coatings. Two organic systems are taken as samples to illustrate it. They are composed of three layers with a common steel sheet substrate and a common PET topcoat. The intermediary layer is soft and thick for the first product while it is hard and thin for the second one.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{electronic}} organic materials, conjugated polymers (CPs) have attracted much attention in recent years. It has been well-established that performances of thin-film devices based on π-conjugated polymers, such as light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors and photovoltaic cells, are strongly dependent on the organisation of the polymer molecules and their interactions with other constituents in multicomponent devices. The use of CPs in integrated circuits, solar cells, light-emitting diodes or sensors often requires their covalent fixation and patterning on various surfaces. CPs can be grafted to functionalized surfaces by (electro) chemical cross-linking; however, {{it is difficult to}} control a structural order within the cross-linked films. The attachment of CP chains to substrates by their end-points to form polymer brushes would be an interesting alternative, and could possibly be crucial for many devices requiring charge injection and charge transport processes. The main aim of this work, which was the synthesis of covalently grafted conjugated polymer brushes on solid substrates using a "grafting from" approach, was successfully performed. During the course of this work, the process of surface-initiated polycondensation was investigated. The newly developed method to selectively graft conjugated polymers from different substrates such as Si-wafers, quartz slides or modificated nanoparticles allowed us to produce different architectures which were earlier possible to prepare only non-conductive polymers. Exposure of the substrate with an activated surface layer into the monomer solution produced polymer brushes in a very economical way. Since only monomer was consumed for grafting from the surface. The grafting process was extensively investigated by different methods, and the thickness of the obtained poly(fluorene) films was elucidated by Null-ellipsometry and confirmed by the AFM <b>scratch-test.</b> Preliminary characteristics of the device, based on PS(Br) -core poly(octylfluorene) -shell nanoparticles, showed satisfactory results (such as turn-on voltage and electroluminescence in a blue region). They could be improved by replacement of the insulating PS(Br) -core of nanoparticles with other substances (semiconductive, etc.). There is still plenty of room for further development and improvement of the synthesis of poly(fluorene) -based polymer brushes. The polymer structures developed in this work can be utilized as an active layer in lab-on-chip devices. Alkyl groups in the 9 th position of the poly(fluorene) monomer unit can be replaced by tailored receptors to detect specific species including small molecules, metal ions and biomolecules due to enhanced sensitivity through sensory signal amplification. Post-polymerization modifications may lead to highly water-swellable conjugated polyelectrolyte brushes. Also, polymerization of initially optically active fluorene-monomers may be the crucial step to the generation of a light source devices with a large degree of circularly polarized electroluminescence. This is of great interest for utilization as backlight for liquid crystalline displays. We believe that the utilization of covalently surface-immobilized conjugated polymers may have a great impact on the development of present-day technological processes...|$|E
