40|$|Thiamine {{pyrophosphate}} (TPP) is the phosphorylated {{and active}} form of thiamine (Vitamin B 1). We {{hypothesized that the}} administration of thiamine in its immediately available active form could provide the metabolic pathways for a supplement able to promote the metabolism of ketoacids and to reduce lactate accumulation in exercising horses. Ten horses were conditioned for 20 days to daily standardized exercise. All horses underwent a first “stress test” (ST) consisting in 1, 200 meters at maximum speed on track, and were checked before and after for clinical and clinical pathology parameters. After the ST, the same animals were administered TPP (Bicarbossilasi®, ©Teknofarmas. p. a., Torino, Italy), 1 mg/Kg b. w., I. V., twice daily for seven days. At the end of treatment, a <b>second</b> <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> (STTPP) was performed. Post-exercise serum lactate concentration resulted in significantly lower levels (p< 0. 05) after treatment with TPP (ST vs STTPP). These data suggest that supplementation with thiamine in its active form improves glucose metabolism and prevents lactate accumulation in muscle, enhancing aerobic capacity and metabolic pathways of glucose utilization during exercise...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Slowed {{heart rate}} {{recovery}} (HRR) {{of less than}} 12 beats per minute in the first minute after an exercise stress test has been suggested as a useful addition to the criteria currently used to assess exercise stress test results. Although HRR has been tested in large populations, the short-term test-retest sta-bility (reproducibility) of abnormal HRR for an individual has not been assessed. METHODS The study was a retrospective comparison of medical record informa-tion using a community-practice–based sample of 90 patients undergoing 2 exer-cise stress tests separated by 18 weeks or less. Concordance of abnormal HRR results on {{the first and second}} stress tests were assessed for individual patients using definitions of abnormal HRR from the medical literature. RESULTS Individual patient’s HRR was markedly variable from the first to <b>second</b> <b>stress</b> <b>test.</b> In this sample, no definition of abnormal HRR provided more than 55 % concordance between results from the first and second stress tests. CONCLUSION These preliminary data suggest that HRR appears to have limited short-term test-retest stability or reproducibility and therefore might not be a reli-able addition to current results of exercise stress tests.

40|$|BackgroundAccording to European guidelines, {{patients}} with stable coronary disease should undergo moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise. Intense physical activity {{may have a}} negative impact on platelet aggregation and the protective effect of antiplatelet (AP) drugs is not documented. The aim of our study was to assess the effect of aspirin (ASA) and P 2 Y 12 receptors antagonists (P 2 Y 12 -RA), before and immediately after intense physical activity. MethodsWe performed a prospective single center cross-over study. Patients had to be treated with dual AP therapy including ASA and P 2 Y 12 -RA (Clopidogrel or Prasugrel), at least 6 months after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but less than the recommended one year, in the absence of significant left ventricular sequelae or residual ischemia. A first Stress test was done with ASA and Clopidogrel or Prasugrel, then, after 2 weeks, the P 2 Y 12 -RA was switched (Prasugrel instead of Clopidogrel and vice versa) and a <b>second</b> <b>Stress</b> <b>test</b> was performed. Platelet responses were analyzed by Aspirin Reaction Units (ARU) and P 2 Y 12 Reaction Units (PRU) measurements, before and immediately after Stress test. Results 23 patients (all men; mean age 57, 7 years) undertaking dual AP therapy (ASA- 75 mg plus Prasugrel- 10 mg or ASA- 75 mg plus Clopidogrel- 75 mg per day) were recruited. Mean Peak Activity reached was 164, 8 Watts. Mean exercise duration was 11. 5 minutes. Mean Maximal Heart Rate reached was 135 beats per minute. Before and after effort: PRU (reference range< 235) was 124, 5 and 112, 8 (p= 0, 5) and 56, 7 and 54, 8 (p= 0, 8) respectively with Clopidrogrel and Prasugrel; ARU (reference range< 550) was 433, 2 and 398. 7 (p= 0, 01). ConclusionIn patients treated after an ACS, inhibitory effects of dual AP therapy are not modified during physical activity. The inhibitory effect of ASA seems even better immediately after a stress test. This is for a resumption of intense physical activity after six months...|$|E

Case presentation We report the case of a 56 -year-old, moderately obese (body mass index of 35) man with a past medical history of sleep apnea, hypertension and hyperlipidemia who suffered from syncope secondary to intense laughter. The patient also had a history of syncope in the distant past when he collapsed on the floor for several <b>seconds.</b> Treadmill <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> after the incident revealed no arrhythmia or ischemic disease, although he complained of dizziness after the test and a sudden drop in blood pressure was noted.

40|$|In {{response}} to increased financial instability {{in many countries}} in the 1990 s, policy makers became interested in better understanding vulnerabilities in financial systems, and particularly in banks. One of the key techniques for quantifying vulnerabilities is <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> This article reviews the literature on <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> of banking systems. The first section introduces the concept of <b>stress</b> <b>testing.</b> The <b>second</b> section overviews <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> performed by international financial institutions, central banks, and other researchers. The third section describes the implementation of <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> The fourth section discusses specific issues relating to individual shock factors. The fifth section provides a conclusion. 1. The Concept of Macroprudential <b>Stress</b> <b>Testing</b> In the context of financial sector analysis, the term <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> refers {{to a range of}} techniques used to help assess the vulnerability of financial institutions or the financial system to exceptional but plausible events. 1 <b>Stress</b> <b>tests</b> were originally developed for use at the portfolio level, to understand how the value of a portfolio changes if there are large changes to its risk factors (such as asset prices). They have become widely used as a risk management tool by financial institutions. 2 In recent years, the techniques have started to be applied in a broader context, with the aim of measuring the sensitivity of a group of financial institutions or even an entire financial system to common shocks. This article focuses on macroprudential (system-focused) <b>stress</b> <b>tests,</b> which are based on applying a common set of shocks and scenarios to a set of financial institutions, in order to analyze both the aggregate impact and the distribution of the impact across the institutions.

There is now substantial proof, that a two-step diagnostic approach is the most performing way to achieve smooth and successful weaning for these patients. The first step consists in careful evaluation of the suspected ready-to-wean patient (assessment of weaning readiness).

40|$|The {{most recent}} {{regulatory}} framework {{implemented by the}} Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) was introduced as an incentive to enhance market discipline and supervisory power of the regulatory authorities. However, these changes seem to challenge financial institutions in structural aspects that could negatively impact the profit efficiency. This paper tries to fill this risk management role need by presenting a customized tool that enables banks to effectively manage their balance sheet, while {{taking into account the}} constraints required by Basel III. Following that, this paper also investigates the impact of the Basel III requirements on several parameters and finishes with two types of impact studies.

Concerning the results taken from the <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> we conclude that higher restrictions influence negatively the retained profit and that under certain stress scenarios ‘Bank I’ would present worryingly high losses.

40|$|Mental stress induces {{transient}} endothelial dysfunction, {{which is}} an important finding for subjects at cardiometabolic risk. Thus, we tested whether aerobic exercise prevents this dysfunction among subjects with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and whether an increase in shear rate during exercise {{plays a role in}} this phenomenon. Subjects with MetS participated in two protocols. in protocol 1 (n = 16), endothelial function was assessed using brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Subjects then underwent a mental <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> followed by either 40 min of leg cycling or rest across two randomized sessions. FMD was assessed again at 30 and 60 min after exercise or rest, with a <b>second</b> mental <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> in between. Mental stress reduced FMD at 30 and 60 min after the rest session (baseline: 7. 7 +/- 0. 4 %, 30 min: 5. 4 +/- 0. 5 %, and 60 min: 3. 9 +/- 0. 5 %, P 0. 05 vs. baseline). Protocol 2 (n = 5) was similar to protocol 1 except that the first period of mental stress was followed by either exercise in which the brachial artery shear rate was attenuated via forearm cuff inflation or exercise without a cuff. Noncuffed exercise prevented the reduction in FMD (baseline: 7. 5 +/- 0. 7 %, 30 min: 7. 0 +/- 0. 7 %, and 60 min: 8. 7 +/- 0. 8 %, P > 0. 05 vs. baseline), whereas cuffed exercise failed to prevent this reduction (baseline: 7. 5 +/- 0. 6 %, 30 min: 5. 4 +/- 0. 8 %, and 60 min: 4. 1 +/- 0. 9 %, P < 0. 05 vs. baseline). in conclusion, exercise prevented mental stress-induced endothelial dysfunction among subjects with MetS, and an increase in shear rate during exercise mediated this effect.

In India, legislation was enacted in 2007 requiring banks to undergo regular <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> In October 2012, U.S. regulators unveiled new rules expanding this practice by requiring the largest American banks to undergo <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> twice per year, once internally and once conducted by the regulators. Starting in 2014 midsized firms (i.e., those with $10-50 billion in assets) are also being required to conduct Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing.In 2012, federal regulators also began recommending portfolio <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> as a sound risk management practice for community banks or institutions that were too small to fall under Dodd-Frank's requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in an October 18, 2012, Bulletin recommends <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> as means to identify and quantify loan portfolio risk. The FDIC made similar recommendations for community banks.|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> for {{diagnosis}} of {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) are incompletely sensitive and specific. Objective: We examined the frequency of significant CAD in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain {{who have had a}} recent negative or inconclusive (< 85 % of predicted maximum heart rate) cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>test.</b> Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of patients identified from ED and cardiology registries at the study hospital. We included patients presenting to the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain, with a negative cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> {{in the past three years}} as the last cardiac test, and hospital admission. One-hundred sixty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. Their admission was reviewed for {{diagnosis of}} CAD by positive serum troponin, percutaneous coronary intervention, or positive <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> while an inpatient. Results: Of 164 patients, 122 (74. 4 %, 95 % CI 67. 7, 81. 1) had a negative <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> prior to the index admission, while 42 (25. 6 %, 95 % CI 18. 9, 32. 3) had otherwise normal but inconclusive <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> Thirty-four (20. 7 %, 95 % CI 14. 4, 27. 0) of the included patients were determined to have CAD. Twenty-five of the 122 patients (20. 5 %, 95 % CI 13. 3, 27. 7) had negative pre-admission <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> and nine of 42 patients (21. 4 %, 95 % CI 9. 0, 33. 8) had inclusive <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> of CAD. A statistical comparison between these two proportions showed no significant difference (p =. 973). Conclusion: Due to inadequate sensitivity, negative non-invasive cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> should not be used to rule out CAD. Patients with negative <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> are just as likely to have CAD as patients with inconclusive <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> [West J Emerg Med 2010; 11 (4) : 384 - 388. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Stress</b> <b>testing</b> is {{a general}} term for {{framework}} that assesses possible impact of an adverse shock on the financial health and a capital adequacy of a bank, other financial institution or the whole financial system. Because credit risk is typically the most important risk of a bank and many international surveys describe the credit risk <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> {{as one of the}} least developed, it became the main topic of this thesis. Credit risk <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> methods developed in the last years very dynamically especially thanks to the requirements on <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> under the Basel II regulatory framework and a fact that further improvement of these methods is expected to ensure higher financial stability of institutions and financial sector to adverse shocks and enable to withstand severe crisis. The thesis concentrates on the micro level <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> that are run by each individual bank. It describes the whole credit risk <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> procedure, Basel II regulatory requirements, the importance of this framework for an institution and offers examples of possible <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> methods and scenarios. The first significant contribution to the topic is a survey on practice in the mayor Czech banks that analyzes whether they are influenced in their credit risk <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> framework by their parents or the [...] ...|$|R
