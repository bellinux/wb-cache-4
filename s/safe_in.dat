Indonesian aviation faces numerous challenges, including poorly maintained, outdated, and often overwhelmed infrastructure, the factor of human error, bad weather, haze problems caused by plantation fires, and volcanic ash spewed by numerous area volcanoes that disrupts air transportation.|$|E

5000|$|Rosanes {{brings a}} claim of Safed's Jewish {{community}} [...] "utter destruction" [...] in his book [...] "History of the Jews in Turkish realm". Jacob de Haas, in his History of Palestine, asserts the near-total destruction of the Safed Jewish community, claiming that [...] "its community had been massacred in 1660, when the town was destroyed by Arabs, and only one Jew escaped." [...] However, Gershom Scholem writes that the reports of the [...] "utter destruction" [...] of the Jewish community <b>in</b> <b>Safed</b> <b>in</b> this time period [...] "seem greatly exaggerated, and the conclusions based on them are false." [...] He points out that Sabbatai Sevi's mystical movement was active <b>in</b> <b>Safed</b> <b>in</b> 1665. Scholem also attributes to the [...] "French trader d'Arvieux who visited <b>Safed</b> <b>in</b> 1660" [...] an understanding of [...] "the religious factor which enabled the community to survive," [...] a belief [...] "'that the Messiah who will be born in Galilee, will make Safed the capital of his new kingdom on earth'"Scholem wrote that there was definitely a Jewish community <b>in</b> <b>Safed</b> <b>in</b> 1664-1667.|$|R
5|$|After its {{unexpected}} redevelopment over Oklahoma, widespread {{damage was}} also reported there. Several communities in central Oklahoma were flooded {{due to the}} heavy rainfall. Watonga, Kingfisher and Geary were the hardest-hit communities, where many houses and buildings were inundated. The weather forced the cancellation of the Hydro Fair as the carnival rides were not <b>safe</b> <b>in</b> heavy rain and high wind. Winds in Watonga gusted as high as 82mph (131km/h), which damaged numerous trees and power lines and heavily damaged mobile homes. The entire community lost power, as did about 15,000 customers in total in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. A section of Interstate 40 was also closed for a while.|$|E

Smith, who had married a white woman, was living in a separate household and working as a teacher; he was also classified as white. The Smith children still at home were Maud, 15; Donald, 12; John, 10; and Guy, 8; all were attending school. Five Smith children survived to adulthood: James, Maud, Donald, John and Guy. The men married white spouses, but Maud never married. All were classified as white from 1860 on.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The <b>safe</b> <b>in</b> the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000.

5|$|In 1956, {{the test}} program was {{transferred}} to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Captain Selmer Sundby took over test-flying duties. The HZ-1 had been designed to be very easy to fly, and early testing indicated that untrained soldiers could learn to operate the craft in less than 20 minutes, and some claiming that only five minutes of instruction were required. In addition, the HZ-1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs evaluated by the Army. Sundby, however, quickly determined that the craft was {{much more difficult to}} fly than had been expected, and would not be <b>safe</b> <b>in</b> the hands of an inexperienced pilot. In addition, the low-mounted rotors proved to be prone to kicking up small rocks and other debris.|$|E
5|$|In July 1863, {{during the}} New York Draft Riots, Irish rioters {{attacked}} and burned down the orphan asylum. The children were {{saved by the}} staff and Union troops in the city. During its nearly 30 years, the orphan asylum had admitted 1310 children, and typically had about 200 in residence at a time. After the riots, Smith moved his family and business out of Manhattan, as did other prominent blacks. Numerous buildings were destroyed in their old neighborhoods, and estimates were that 100 blacks {{were killed in the}} rioting. No longer feeling <b>safe</b> <b>in</b> the lower Fourth Ward, the Smiths moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|Kantakouzenos' second {{departure}} {{proved a}} great error. Back in the capital, his enemies moved in his absence.

The Patriarch, backed by Apokaukos' group and {{the authority of the}} Empress, dismissed Kantakouzenos from his offices and declared him a public enemy. Kalekas himself was proclaimed regent and Apokaukos named Eparch of Constantinople. Kantakouzenos' relatives and supporters were imprisoned or forced to flee the city, and their properties confiscated. Although Kantakouzenos' wife and children were <b>safe</b> <b>in</b> his headquarters at Demotika (Didymoteicho), the regency placed his mother, Theodora, under house arrest. The privations she suffered during her imprisonment were to cause her eventual death.|$|E
