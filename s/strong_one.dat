Despite the history of their children, George and Anne's marriage was a <b>strong</b> <b>one.</b> George died aged 55 from a recurring and chronic lung disease, much to the devastation of his wife, and he was buried in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|As expected, Chapman {{was named}} as captain for the Australian tour. The MCC touring team was {{regarded}} as a <b>strong</b> <b>one</b> by commentators; the only controversy was the omission of Frank Woolley which was not fully explained. Rumours in later years said that Chapman was responsible for leaving Woolley out as he was jealous of his county team-mate, but Lemmon regards this as unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The Waterloo {{position}} was a <b>strong</b> <b>one.</b> It {{consisted of a}} long ridge running east-west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along {{the crest of the}} ridge ran the Ohain road, a deep sunken lane. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was a large elm tree that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.|$|E

5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code {{on the grounds that}} the case was not a good test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a <b>strong</b> <b>one,</b> the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E
5|$|However, Rodes beat Schurz to Oak Hill, so the XI Corps {{division}} {{was forced to}} take up positions in the broad plain north of the town, below and {{to the east of}} Oak Hill. They linked up with the I Corps reserve division of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson, whose two brigades had been sent forward by Doubleday when he heard about Ewell's arrival. Howard's defensive line was not a particularly <b>strong</b> <b>one</b> in the north. He was soon outnumbered (his XI Corps, still suffering the effects of their defeat at the Battle of Chancellorsville, had only 8,700 effectives), and the terrain his men occupied in the north was poorly selected for defense. He held out some hope that reinforcements from Slocum's XII Corps would arrive up the Baltimore Pike in time to make a difference.|$|E
5|$|The 1947 {{season was}} another <b>strong</b> <b>one</b> for Speedie. In {{a game against}} the Buffalo Bills, he tied a {{professional}} football record by catching a throw from Graham and running 99 yards for a touchdown. He finished the season as the league leader in receptions and receiving yards as the Browns won another championship. His 67 catches and 1,146 receiving yards, in fact, were the second-best in pro football history after Don Hutson of the Green Bay Packers, who caught for 1,211 yards in 1940. Speedie was named by news outlets as a first-team All-Pro. Speedie's success in 1947 came as he, Graham and Lavelli gelled as a passing and receiving unit, having studied hours of tape and worked on their technique and coordination. Speedie studied how defensive backs moved their feet and tried to break into the open by exploiting mis-steps. They experimented with screen passes and made modifications to common receiving routes to exploit the weaknesses of defenses.|$|E

5|$|The 1950 {{season was}} another <b>strong</b> <b>one</b> for Cleveland. The team {{finished}} {{the regular season}} with a 10–2 record, tied with the New York Giants for {{first place in the}} American Conference. This set up a playoff with the Giants to secure a spot in the championship game against the Los Angeles Rams. Cleveland won 8–3, thanks in part to Gillom's punts. His kicks repeatedly gave the Giants poor field position and pinned them near their own end zone. The Browns {{went on to win the}} championship against the Rams on a last-minute Lou Groza field goal. Gillom finished second in the league in punting average, with 43.2 yards.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Graham {{and some of}} his teammates enlisted in the military but continued to play for Northwestern. Enlistees from other schools also enrolled at Northwestern, where the U.S. Navy had a training station. The 1943 season was a <b>strong</b> <b>one</b> for Northwestern. The team beat Ohio State, the defending national champions, and a good military team at Great Lakes Naval Station. The Wildcats lost to Notre Dame and Michigan, however, and finished the season with an 8–2 record and a ninth-place ranking in the AP Poll. Graham set another Big Ten passing record, was named the conference's Most Valuable Player, received All-American honors and finished third in Heisman Trophy voting. By the end of his college career, he held a Big Ten Conference record for passing yards with 2,132.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{year was a}} <b>strong</b> <b>one</b> as Jim Brown gritted out another league-leading rushing season. The Browns ended with an 11–3 record and comfortably won the eastern division. That set up a second straight appearance in the NFL Championship game against the Packers on a slippery, mucky Lambeau Field on January 2, 1966. While the score was close early on, Vince Lombardi's team held the Browns scoreless in the second half, winning 23–12 in an upset on a Paul Hornung touchdown. After the season, the NFL and the competing American Football League agreed to merge starting in 1970, but would play an inter-league championship from the 1966 season onward. The 1965 championship thus became the NFL's last before the Super Bowl era, which ushered in a new age of popularity and prosperity for professional football.|$|E

5|$|The {{victory against}} the British invasions brought forth great changes in the {{politics}} of Buenos Aires. The viceroy Sobremonte was discredited by his management of the conflict, and the Cabildo increased its influence; as such, it removed the viceroy and appointed Liniers as replacement, an unprecedented action. The local criollos, who had limited chances of social promotion in the system of castas, got such a chance with the increased influence of the militias. Cornelio Saavedra, head of the biggest crioolo militia, thus became a highly influential man {{in the politics of}} Buenos Aires. He resented the weak support from the Spanish monarchy to the war effort, compared with the <b>strong</b> <b>one</b> received from the cabildos of other cities in the Americas. As a result, he was loyal to the new viceroy, of French ancestry, considering him to be less subject to the internal disputes of the House of Bourbon.|$|E
