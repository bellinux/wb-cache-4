6000|$|... "Honour {{does not}} for instance, <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{that you should}} repair to the Conciergerie and take the place that belongs to you, and which another is filling?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I now <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{that the}} other letters {{from left to right}} are, M, M, a small d, A, a small d, and then the final B." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{shall have}} more than one notion of future work to <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> while we are beguiling the dreariness of an arctic winter in these parts. May they prosper! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So you say, Chauvelin; and {{therefore}} I <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> certain measures <b>to</b> prevent the woman escaping {{which you will}} find adequate, I hope." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In my case <b>suggests</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> other reflections. Be {{gentle and}} spare me them. In {{a world of}} rough actions, what need to emphasise them with rough words?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't {{recommend}} that, my lord. Why {{should we}} give it up? The interests at stake are very great. I couldn't for a moment think of <b>suggesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> give it up." ...|$|R
60|$|And perhaps they'll <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{that however}} old {{the world is}} it's ever young, and that when all's said and done the most {{permanent}} {{on the face of}} the earth is what seems the most transitory--the ideal.|$|E
6000|$|This, Mitchy frankly showed, {{was more}} {{difficult}} to say, but he in time brought it out. [...] "Well, of appearing to <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that my existence, in a prolonged state of singleness, may ever represent for her any real alternative." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, I merely {{wanted to}} <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that Mr. Slope {{seems to think}} that if Mr. Harding be not appointed, public feeling in the matter would be against us, and that the press might perhaps take it up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unless I am greatly mistaken," [...] he said, [...] "your long {{experience}} in such things has even <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> sir, that Miss Gwilt {{might turn out}} to be known to the police?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You look honest," [...] she said. [...] "Perhaps you are. Perhaps I have doubted {{you without}} a cause. But I will {{ask you this}} question. Has it been <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> by any of them that you should watch us--my uncle and me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That isn't all. I {{made up my}} mind--Well, to {{make the}} game more even. And so I <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and joined with you in this {{expedition}} of yours, invented a sister at Midhurst--I tell you, I HAVEN'T a sister! For one object--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{misunderstand}} me a little," [...] Deane said slowly. [...] "What I {{am going}} to <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> may seem difficult enough, and, under the circumstances, unpleasant, {{but there is no}} actual risk--at least," [...] he corrected himself, [...] "there should be none." ...|$|E
6000|$|The captain's voice {{checked the}} general {{outbreak}} of laughter. [...] "That will do, quarter-master. Let it be understood that nobody is {{to shoot the}} bird--and let me <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> sir, {{that you might have}} expressed your sentiments quite as effectually in less violent language." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{tell you}} just yet, boy. But answer me this. Are {{you willing to}} take any farm I <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and {{henceforth}} to give up all notion of wandering over {{the face of the}} earth, and devote yourself steadily to your new profession?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I entirely believe you, madam," [...] said Sherlock Holmes. [...] "The recital {{of these}} events must be very painful <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and perhaps it {{will make it easier}} if I tell you what occurred, and you can check me if I make any {{material}} mistake. The sending of this letter was <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> by Stapleton?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He paused, {{and then}} said, 'Alicia, let us {{understand}} each other. Do <b>you</b> mean <b>to</b> tell me, once for all, {{that if your}} sister is willing to become my wife you absolutely make way for her, and will not entertain any thought of what I <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> any more?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle," [...] said he, [...] "Monsieur La Boulaye {{here was}} very reticent {{touching}} {{the manner in}} which my release has been gained. But I never doubted that I owed it to your good efforts, and that you had adopted the course <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> by my letter, and bought me from the Republic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was inevitable," [...] he declared. [...] "It is not, of course, a {{pleasant}} subject of conversation {{for you or}} for me, yet I think I may venture to <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that your sister's--er--indiscretions--have reached a point which makes a separation between you almost a necessity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the hope}} and {{expectation}} {{that you will}} agree with me in this matter, I venture to <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> the propriety of trying to win the affections of Miss Crusty. You already know that her fortune will be a large one. I recommend this subject to your earnest consideration.|$|E
60|$|I would <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{that this}} is only a very extreme {{instance}} of the general state of affairs, that there may be finer and subtler differences of level between one term and another, and that terms may very well be thought of as lying obliquely and as being twisted through different levels.|$|E
60|$|Since I last conversed {{with you}} on the subject, I have been {{thinking}} over again the plan I <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> concerning the application of Count Rumford's plan to the city of Bristol. I have arranged in my mind the manner, and matter of the Pamphlet, which would be three sheets, and might be priced at one shilling.|$|R
6000|$|Could you not re-write the story, and inject into it {{the social}} [...] atmosphere, {{and return it}} to us for further consideration? It [...] is <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that you have the hero, Van Sweller, drop [...] in for luncheon or dinner once or twice at ---- [10] or at the [...] ---- [11] which will be in line with the changes desired.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do {{mean to say}}! I mean to say {{all that}} your mind is now <b>suggesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I quite {{understand}} your feelings when you declare that a man does not like to talk of his own sister, and therefore we will talk of your sister no more. Old fellow, don't look at me as though <b>you</b> meant <b>to</b> drop me." ...|$|R
60|$|Does it <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{reflections}} {{when you}} reflect {{that this is}} the most important event which has happened to me in ten days--unless I count--in my handing a cabman over to the police day before yesterday, with the proper formalities, and promised to appear in court when his case comes up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really," [...] the Marquis expostulated, [...] "you are {{behaving}} {{in a most}} unreasonable manner. I am here to discuss the past. For any wrong which you may consider I have done you, I express my regret. I <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that your daughter's present position in life should reconcile you to what has happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] he said; [...] "I do {{not like}} interfering with other people's business, but for reasons {{unconnected}} with myself I <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{that it would be}} wise to stop this ship and get out the boats. The sea is calm; if it is not left till too late there should be no difficulty in launching them." ...|$|E
60|$|It's in your way, and you'll do it {{a hundred}} times better than I can <b>suggest</b> it <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> I know.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she {{answered}} gravely, [...] "the Prince Abi <b>suggested</b> it <b>to</b> <b>you</b> but now, did he not, after <b>you</b> had <b>suggested</b> it <b>to</b> him, and <b>you</b> refused--for your own reasons?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about it, and unless {{everything}} is told me I will not undertake this mission. Your uncle evidently thinks that by my interference the thing may be arranged. I {{have had the same}} idea all through myself, but as you have been so obstinate I have not liked to say so. Now, Arabella, begin from the beginning. When was it that he first <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> the idea of marriage?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You and I think {{differently}} on many matters," [...] she said. [...] "But {{we are both}} agreed, I am sure, in feeling the sincerest interest in Isabel's welfare. I beg to <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Miss Pink, that Mr. Hardyman, as a near neighbor of yours, is a very undesirable neighbor while Isabel remains in your house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} understand," [...] said the master, {{slightly}} resenting the classification, [...] "that my reason for inquiring about the permanency of your daughter's attendance was {{simply because it}} might be necessary to arrange her studies in a way more suitable to her years; perhaps even to <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that a young ladies' seminary might be more satisfactory"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Mrs. Stringham {{presently}} brought out, [...] "I {{tell you}} all when I tell you that Maud asks me to <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that it may perhaps {{be better for the}} present not to speak of him: not to speak of him to her niece, that is, unless she herself speaks to you first. But Maud thinks she won't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{we could}} dig into that," [...] I said, [...] "I expect we should find {{the bones of}} the people who {{inhabited}} this place. Does that <b>suggest</b> anything <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Stephen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|CHR. But did you think, when {{at first}} he <b>suggested</b> it <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> that {{there was such a}} man to be found, of whom it might justly be said, that He never {{committed}} sin? ...|$|R
60|$|I am not one {{of those}} who in expressing {{opinions}} confine themselves to facts. I don't know anything that mars good literature so completely as too much truth. Facts contain a deal of poetry, but you can't use too many of them without damaging your literature. I love all literature, and as long as I am a doctor of literature--I have <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for twenty years I have been diligently trying to improve my own literature, and now, by virtue of the University of Oxford, I mean to doctor everybody else's.|$|R
