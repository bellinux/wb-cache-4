25|$|The {{notion that}} there <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> {{standard}} correspondence between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the angles of the triangle comes {{as soon as one}} recognizes that similar triangles maintain the same ratios between their sides. That is, for any similar triangle the ratio of the hypotenuse (for example) and another of the sides remains the same. If the hypotenuse is twice as long, so are the sides. It is these ratios that the trigonometric functions express.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive {{advantages}} of the asexual forms are in quantity of the progeny and the {{advantages of}} the hermaphrodite forms – in maximum diversity. Transition from the hermaphrodite to dioecious state leads to a loss of {{at least half of the}} diversity. So, the main question is to explain the advantages given by sexual differentiation, i.e. the benefits of two separate sexes compared to hermaphrodites rather than to explain benefits of sexual forms (hermaphrodite + dioecious) over asexual ones. It has already been understood that since sexual reproduction is not associated with any clear reproductive advantages, as compared with asexual, there <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> important advantages in evolution.|$|E

Since {{it was also}} a horror game and the visuals were impressive, the team challenged themselves to develop higher quality graphics and outshine Resident Evil. According to Kono, Clock Tower was developed with a [...] "material comes first" [...] mindset, as opposed to the [...] "game system" [...] given priority with the [...] "material" [...] superimposed on top. The team used 3D graphics and extensive animation as they sought to portray murders as real as possible in both normal and surreal settings.

500|$|In a few areas, Madison's plan {{included}} {{provisions that}} had little {{support among the}} delegates. Few agreed with Madison that the legislature {{should be able to}} invalidate state laws, so the idea was dropped. While most thought there <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> mechanism to invalidate bad laws by congress, few agreed with Madison that a board of the executive and judges should decide on this. Instead, the power was given solely to the executive {{in the form of the}} veto. Many also thought this would be useful to protect the executive, whom many worried might become beholden to an imperial legislature. Also, during the deliberations, the New Jersey Plan was introduced, although it was more of a protest to the excessive national character of the Virginia plan, and was not seriously considered. The office of Vice President was also included later in the deliberations, mainly to provide the president a successor if he was unable to complete his term but also to provide presidential electors with an incentive to vote for at least one out of state candidate in addition to a [...] "favorite son" [...] from their own state or region.|$|E
500|$|The Austro-Hungarian Marinekommandant (Navy Commander), Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck, {{outlined}} in a memorandum of 8 September 1884 {{the requirements for}} a torpedo cruiser. Such a vessel should have a reinforced bow for ramming as well as torpedoes for attacks on larger warships. The cruisers would also be small and fast enough to undertake patrol and reconnaissance duties. The first two ships of Sterneck's program, the , were built in Britain so the Austro-Hungarian Navy could gain experience building small cruisers. The program was overseen by the naval engineer Siegfried Popper, who was tasked with designing a third cruiser in July 1885, to be built domestically. The Panther class {{provided the basis for}} the third ship, Tiger. A commission was convened on 16 September to discuss the parameters for the new cruiser; among the questions were whether the ship would replicate the Panther-class ships or it would be an entirely new design. Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Alexander Eberan von Eberhorst, who headed the commission in charge of the cruiser program, instructed Popper that the commission had decided that the new ship should have a speed of not less than [...] and carry two [...] guns like the Panthers, but the ship <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> [...] larger.|$|E
500|$|Under Bruce the Australian {{government}} also moved {{to its new}} permanent home in the planned federal city of Canberra. Plans for a new federal capital had been circulated {{since the time of}} Federation, and a site on the Molonglo River was selected in 1913. Design and construction had proceeded slowly due to World War I as well as funding and management problems. Bruce was a committed advocate of the new capital, however, stating: [...] "For the purposes of Federation it was essential that there <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> central point of nationhood, suitable to Australia as a nation... and sooner or later {{there would have to be}} a national capital, overriding State boundaries and State prejudices." [...] This came to pass on 9 May 1927 when the Federal Parliament moved to its new premises in Canberra; Bruce had moved himself and his wife to The Lodge a few days earlier. At the Federal Parliament's opening ceremony, Bruce decided that voices of the clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate were too heavily accented, and determined that he would personally welcome the Duke of York and co-open the new building a move that was criticised by several parliamentarians. The business of transferring government and cabinet operations to the new capital proceeded slowly over 1927 and 1928. This was an administrative task that occupied a significant proportion of the government's time in those years, with many departments only very gradually transferring from Melbourne, much to Bruce's consternation.|$|E

[...] Weldy was outraged by a report that the Tri-State League (successor to the Ohio State League) had abandoned racial integration. [...] In March 1888, {{he wrote a letter}} to the league's president protesting the decision. [...] In his 1970 history of racial segregation in baseball, Robert Peterson described Weldy's letter as [...] "perhaps the most passionate cry for justice ever voiced by a Negro athlete."
