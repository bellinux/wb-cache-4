30|$|In conclusion, {{language}} barriers may compromise {{the health of}} multicultural societies through poor access to pertinent preventive health information and its related poor access to quality healthcare services. Thus, all efforts to test the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed language-bridging strategy, particularly in plural societies that lack multicultural health policies and programmes, are worth considering. It is imperative that longitudinal study designs are adopted to ascertain the long term impact of the proposed intervention {{on the health of}} migrant and ethnocultural groups, as well as the feasibility of the MHIM in guiding development and implementation of the intervention. Also, research that examines the impact of an extended version of the intervention, where the intervention content can be accessed as automated voice messages by dialing short codes on mobile phones, may support special groups such as the visually impaired and those incapable of reading, to access key health information. Finally, future research that considers the benefits of “global integration” as associated with the concept of omniculturalism, compared to the sociocultural integration of multiculturalism needs to be championed and any necessary revisions to the proposed intervention, <b>duly</b> <b>effected.</b>|$|R

40|$|Software {{services}} are inevitably {{exposed to a}} fluctuating threat picture. Unfortunately, not all threats can be handled only with preventive measures during design and development, but also require adap-tive mitigations at runtime. In this paper we describe an approach where we model composite services and threats together, which allows us to create preventive measures at design-time. At runtime, our specification also allows the service runtime environment (SRE) to receive alerts about active threats {{that we have not}} handled, and react to these automatically through adaptation of the composite ser-vice. A goal-oriented security requirements modelling tool is used to model business-level threats and analyse how they may impact goals. A process flow modelling tool, utilising Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) and standard error boundary events, allows us to define how threats should be responded to during service execution on a technical level. Throughout the software life-cycle, we maintain threats in a centralised threat repository. Re-use of these threats extends further into monitoring alerts being distributed through a cloud-based messaging service. To demonstrate our approach in practice, we have developed a proof-of-concept service for the Air Traffic Manage-ment (ATM) domain. In addition to the design-time activities, we show how this composite <b>service</b> <b>duly</b> adapts itself when a service component is exposed to a threat at runtime. ...|$|R

2500|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, the Severn Beach line {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers, and saw the withdrawal of a special schoolchildren's service. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested that all services along the line be withdrawn. Following meetings with staff, it was decided to keep the line open to Severn Beach, but to close the section to Pilning, and also end services via Henbury. These <b>services</b> <b>duly</b> ended, but the line was still threatened, and on 10 February 1967 it was announced that all services between [...] and Severn Beach would be discontinued. An enquiry followed, and in June that year the decision was reversed, on the condition that tickets be issued on the trains. Thus, on 17 July 1967, all stations along the line, other than Temple Meads, had their staff withdrawn. The decrease of costs allowed a reduction of ticket prices, but the line was still under threat until in June 1969 it was decided that the line's closure would result in significant hardship, and so a grant was allocated to ensure continued services. Most of the line was reduced to single track in late 1970, leaving Clifton Down as one of the few passing places.|$|R

60|$|It {{was soon}} {{discovered}} that, without {{taking into consideration}} the average annual advantages which would necessarily spring from their new connection, the profits which must accrue upon the present expedition alone had already doubled {{the capital of the}} island. Everybody in Vraibleusia had either made a fortune, or laid the foundation of one. The penniless had become prosperous, and the principal merchants and manufacturers, having realised large capitals, retired from business. But the colossal fortunes were made by the gentlemen who had assisted the administration in raising the price of the public funds and in managing the issues of the pink shells. The effect of this immense increase of the national wealth and of this creation of new and powerful classes of society was speedily felt. Great moves to the westward were perpetual, and a variety of sumptuous squares and streets were immediately run up in that chosen land. Butlers were at a premium; coach-makers never slept; card-engravers, having exhausted copper, had recourse to steel; and the demand for arms at the Heralds' College was so great that even the mystical genius of Garter was exhausted, and hostile meetings were commenced between the junior members of some ancient families, to whom the same crest had been unwittingly apportioned; but, the seconds interfering, they discovered themselves to be relations. All the eldest sons were immediately to get into Parliament, and all the younger ones as quickly into the Guards; and the simple Fantaisian Envoy, who had the peculiar felicity of taking everything au pied du lettre, made a calculation that, if these arrangements were <b>duly</b> <b>effected,</b> in a short time the Vraibleusian representatives would exceed the Vraibleusian represented; and that there would be at least three officers in the Vraibleusian guards to every private. Judging from the beards and mustachios which now abounded, this great result was near at hand. With the snub nose which is the characteristic of the millionaires, these appendages produce a pleasing effect.|$|R

Most of the Severn Beach Line was reduced to single track in late 1970, leaving Clifton Down as one of the few passing places.

40|$|Abstract—Soil {{contamination}} {{with lead}} (Pb) {{has become a}} common problem in many farmlands and natural ecosystems as well. Thus, the contamination of food produced in those farms has become a serious concern. For the study, twenty-four permanent plots were chose in the forested area. Three treatments, addition of compost, mycorrhizae, compost with mycorrhizae, and a control used. The indicator plant that used to identify the response to soil Pb, was Anthemis Anthemis. Treatments applied to 5 randomly selected Anthemis Anthemis of approximately 0. 5 m height residing in each plot. Soluble soil Pb and soil organic matter (SOM) compared using soil samples collected at 0. 20 m depth level. Soil samples collected three times. Foliar samples from “treated ” plants analyzed for Pb. During the experimental period, the selected samples closely monitored and changes in health were <b>duly</b> recorded. <b>Effect</b> of standard compost and mycorrhizae on protecting samples from stressful conditions was significant (p< 0. 001). The results from soil and foliar analysis revealed the status of Pb contamination during rain, which appears to have links {{with the death of}} Anthemis Anthemis plants. Positive correlations between soil Pb and leaf Pb were significant (p= 0. 001). Soil amendment with compost and mycorrhizae reduced the Pb content below the threshold levels (p=< 0. 001). Application of compost and mycorrhizae appeared to be effective in reducing Pb toxicity in the soil. Soil improvement with standard compost and mycorrhizae appears to be effective in treating contaminated soils with Pb. Index Terms—Golestan, soil contamination, lead, compost...|$|R
