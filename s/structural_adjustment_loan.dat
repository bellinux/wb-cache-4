50|$|Easterly also {{highlights}} the problematic nature of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>loan</b> programs—aid given under certain conditions—which became {{very popular in}} the 1980s. Rather than initiating true economic reform, states only pretended to adjust their policies. Because shortfalls would elicit increased loans and donors demonstrated little interest in revoking aid, there was little incentive for states to improve their policies. Debt forgiveness regimes produced the same moral hazard, as authoritarian governments considered forgiveness as a free pass to continue to steal from their peoples’ futures. Easterly suggests that aid should be tied to prior achievement rather than promises of political leaders, and that aid should increase with further improvement (similar to the incentive structure of the Earned Income Tax Credit).|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, however, Venezuela sought {{funds from}} the major multilaterals, such as the World Bank and the IMF, {{after more than a}} decade of detachment. The World Bank was active in Venezuela from 1961 to 1974, disbursing {{thirteen}} loans worth US$340 million. Because of its high per capita income, however, Venezuela did not become eligible for World Bank financing until 1986. In 1989 it received over US$700 million in the form of a <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>loan</b> and a trade reform loan. Venezuela also used its large and previously untapped reserves at the IMF in 1989, when the IMF disbursed the first installment of a threeyear Extended Fund Facility in the amount of US$4.8 billion. These new funds helped ease the country's painful transition to a more open economy, a transition undertaken largely on the advice of the IMF and the World Bank. Another multilateral agency, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), also continued to fund Venezuela's development in highway construction, forestry programs, water and sanitation projects, mining, and other infrastructure projects. In cumulative terms, the IDB provided approximately US$1.3 billion from 1961 to 1990.|$|E

Though the country achieved targeted successes in the horticulture and apparel industries, overall Kenya’s trade liberalization failed to produce sustained growth, promote decent employment opportunities, or lessen the incidence of poverty and inequality.

25|$|The {{effect of}} <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{policies}} on poor countries {{has been one}} of the most significant criticisms of the World Bank. The 1979 energy crisis plunged many countries into economic crisis. The World Bank responded with <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans,</b> which distributed aid to struggling countries while enforcing policy changes in order to reduce inflation and fiscal imbalance. Some of these policies included encouraging production, investment and labour-intensive manufacturing, changing real exchange rates and altering the distribution of government resources. <b>Structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, economic growth regressed and inflation worsened. The alleviation of poverty was not a goal of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans,</b> and the circumstances of the poor often worsened, due to a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food, as subsidies were lifted.|$|R

The period of 1980 s was more focused towards denationalization and the role of public sector was to be reduced. In this context two agreements were made on Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with IMF and <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Loan</b> (SAL) with World Bank. These two agreements were the preconditions of USA for rescheduling Pakistan’s $ 160 millions debt, accumulated over the years.

It continues to have debates on basic questions about the economic framework. Issues deemed resolved may be resurrected with a new Supreme Court decision, a new legislative proposal, a new decision by a regulator, a new move to privatize or create a new regulator.

40|$|Trinidad and Tobago are {{the leading}} oil and gas {{production}} economy in the Caribbean. Countless reports prove the significant contribution oil production makes to this nation's economy. This twin island {{is also one of the}} foremost global exporters of methanol and ammonia to the U. S market (IHS Chemical, World Methanol Analysis 2013; FERTECON Ammonia Outlook 2014). However, some may argue that this resource-rich country remains heavily reliant on revenues generated by gas production. Although Trinidad and Tobago have succeeded, to a limited extent, in diversifying the economy from energy to manufacturing, services and eco-tourism, it currently faces a major economic insecurity. More recently, several local economists including Hosein (2016) have issued statements warning the Trinidad and Tobago Government that failure to reform the economy particularly in areas of economic diversification can result in a repeat of the 1989 IMF <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Loan</b> fiasco. Hosein (2016) and others argue that economic diversification will reduce risk and ensure long-term industrial development. In this vein, I use my presentation to examine the concept and importance of economic diversification in light the brief situation analysis outlined above. There have been continuous debates about the industrial value of creativity and culture in societies (see the works of Eleonora Belfiore). The basic idea is that wealth and income-generating opportunities can be obtained through individual creativity skills, talent and local culture.

The second category comprises 2 ̆ 2 ideas of Education Development combined with Social Development 2 ̆ 2. It includes a point of view that considers Education Development as a sector of social development; while it also affects other sectors such as sanitation, nutrition, population and environment etc. This is particularly true of the education of girls. Social Integration and Endogenous Development are also included in this category. In these theories, educated citizens are considered as the key social asset which determines the development of a country. The third category consists of 2 ̆ 2 ideas of Human Assets 2 ̆ 2.

40|$|Egypt {{has shown}} good {{progress}} {{on a number}} of indicators for economic development in recent years. This progress, however, seems to only benefit the higher strata of society and not {{the vast majority of the}} population. In this thesis I take a look at how the transition to a liberal market economy has affected the peripheral governorate of Matruh on Egypt s northwest coast and how easy it is for small and medium enterprises to develop their businesses. I then try to reflect on how this data sheds light on the advantages and disadvantages of the current Egyptian economic model. Egypt officially shifted from a state-controlled to a liberal market economy in the 1990 s with their signing of a <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Loan</b> with the World Bank and a Stand-By Agreement with the IMF. These institutions advocate integration of developing countries into the free market world economy, abolishment of all kinds of inward-looking protectionist strategies and reduction of the role of the state and public sector as much as possible. The critics of this neo-liberal strategy for development say that all of today s rich and developed countries have used protectionist strategies to nurture infant industries until they were able to compete on the international market. In light of the recent transition to a liberal market economy, proclaimed objectives for the Egyptian government are to promote investment and the size of the private sector, encourage the growth of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and have all areas of the country take part in development on an equal footing through a comprehensive decentralisation process. In my data it first of all becomes clear that Egypt remains an only partially liberalised country as the traditionally strong central state with its vast bureaucracy remains strong. On the other side, the economy has been liberalised in that it fully allows the forces of the free market to rule in the private sector. Also, the state has pulled out its support, and private businesses are no longer encouraged by state subsidy, directed credit or help with marketing. Judging by the impediments faced by my interviewees, the Egyptian economic model is currently one that has kept the disadvantages of socialism and added the problems of capitalism. First, representatives from the different trades and industries say that they lack opportunity to develop their businesses due to the cost and complications in relation to state bureaucracy. Second, they lack either sources for funding, or sufficient marketing, or both. What is more, the state remaining so centralised, peripheral regions like Matruh do not at all seem to get the same attention in terms of what state services there still are. Due to Matruh s still being characterised by its history as a remote and cut off area dominated by the rule of Bedouin tribes and its limited number of inhabitants, business is also to a great extent limited to the local market...|$|E

5000|$|After {{a series}} of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans</b> and debt {{restructuring}} led by the International Monetary Fund {{in the late twentieth}} century, Latin America experienced a significant increase in inequality.

40|$|The {{widening}} {{fiscal deficit}} of sub-national governments {{has made the}} task of macroeconomic stabilisation much more difficult and complex. In many countries, including India, multilateral lending institutions provide assistance for sub-national fiscal reforms through <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans</b> (henceforth SAL) with conditionalities heavily loaded with fiscal correction measures. This paper examines the fiscal impact of SAL in Indian states by analysing the quantitative and qualitative aspects of SAL-induced fiscal reforms. Econometric investigation of fiscal impact reveals that state specific effect of SAL in terms of fiscal consolidation has been mixed. There is evidence of softening of the budget constraints in some states, {{but there is also}} evidence of greater reduction in fiscal imbalances of SAL states than non-SAL states. It is also seen that much of the fiscal gains have occurred through improved revenue productivity of the tax system and not through expenditure restructuring. It is also seen that the poorer states have preferred to reduce their developmental expenditures to deal with fiscal stress and to comply with fiscal correction targets. This, in turn, has had adverse growth implications. The paper concludes that the benefits and the acceptability of SAL at the sub-national level in India would critically depend on factors such as the qualitative change in government expenditure in meeting deficient delivery of public services at state level, and the removal of state level social and infrastructural bottlenecks for promotion of growth by releasing government resources through expenditure restructuring and reform. <b>Structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans,</b> fiscal deficit, macroeconomic stabilisation, sub-national governments,...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on the World Bank in neoliberal governance tends to assume that its strategies are largely shaped by {{the objectives of the}} US. The hegemony of neoliberalism as a political paradigm in the US is conventionally considered to be expressed in the Bank as the ‘Washington Consensus’. The <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>loan</b> is the medium through which the Washington Consensus is extended to the realm of ‘development’. Yet structural adjustment lending was developed before the neoliberal paradigm became hegemonic in the US, in the service of Bank policy objectives which did not express the tenets of the Washington Consensus. The tendency of critical accounts to ignore this disjuncture and adopt the Washington Consensus narrative suggests that they take the Bank’s capacity to enact US objectives for granted. My central claim in response to this is that the Bank has never been a passive recipient of the American hegemonic agenda. I articulate this argument at two levels of analysis. Firstly, I draw upon Constructivist accounts in arguing that the agency of management was crucial in creating an organisational structure which allowed the Bank to meet the imperatives associated with the development of its operations. The process of developing a viable organisational structure allowed management to carve out a proprietary terrain in which their agency is decisive in constructing the tools and strategies of governance. However, I move beyond the Constructivist tendency to de-contextualise managerial agency, by arguing that management’s strategic choices are socially anchored in the infrastructure of American financial capital. Secondly, I argue that the social basis of the Bank in private American finance means its relationship with the US is defined by its imperative as an institution: is to secure access to the uniquely deeply capitalised US financial system. In pursuing this institutional imperative, the Bank’s agenda has become increasingly intertwined with US objectives. However, the parameters of its capacity to act are set by the basis of its operations in private US finance. On this basis, I offer a revisionist history of development of Bank’s structure and lending practices at four critical moments from the 1930 s to 1980 s, which leads me to cast the turn to neoliberal governance in a new light. Firstly, I explore the enlistment of US financiers in support of the Bank at Bretton Woods. Secondly I illustrate how the Bank’s imperative of capitalisation crystallised as it began lending. Thirdly, I demonstrate how management’s pragmatic negotiation of the Bank’s institutional imperative shaped the technology of governance during the Bretton Woods era. Finally, I present the origins of structural adjustment lending in McNamara’s strategic renovation of the Bank’s institutional structure and lending practices in order to render pro-poor lending strategy legible to US financiers. Structural adjustment was not an artefact of American power, but was rooted in management’s pragmatic negotiation of the imperatives which followed from the social anchoring of the Bretton Woods order in the unique infrastructure of American finance. Ultimately I will show that American hegemony cannot be understood without the agency of the Bank...|$|E

40|$|One {{feature of}} <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans</b> {{that has been}} often {{overlooked}} in their evaluation is their frequent repetition to the same country, with such extremes as the 30 IMF and World Bank <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans</b> to Argentina over 1980 - 99 or the 26 <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans</b> to Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. The rate of repetition remains high and non-decreasing as cumulative <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans</b> increases. Repetition changes {{the nature of the}} selection problem, with the possible implication that new loans had to be given because earlier loans were not effective. Seventeen out of the eighteen countries that were IDA in 1980 and were in the top half of <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans</b> received became eligible for HIPC debt relief, compared to less than 50 percent of the IDA countries in the bottom half of adjustment lending [...] again suggesting that previous loans were not effective at generating the growth necessary to service the debt. There were relative successes and failures, but none of the top 20 recipients of adjustment lending over 1980 - 99 were able to achieve reasonable growth and contain all policy distortions. Policies improved unevenly as <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans</b> accumulated, and even those policies that improved show a nonlinear satiation point after a certain number of <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans</b> is reached. An overall indicator of severe macroeconomic policy distortion does not improve as the number of <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans</b> increases in the overall sample, with about half the <b>adjustment</b> <b>loan</b> recipients showing severe distortions regardless of the number of cumulative <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans.</b> An instrumental variables regression for estimating the causal effect of repeated adjustment lending on policies shows a significant but small improvement for some macro policies, but none for others.

40|$|Simple {{comparisons}} of growth rates {{in countries that}} {{have had at least}} two <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans</b> (SALs) or at least three <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans</b> show that their growth has improved more than that of other countries. But simple {{comparisons of}} the performance of groups of countries are poor estimators of the effectiveness of adjustment programs because the performance of an adjusting country is the result of: (a) the policies that would have been in place even without <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans</b> from the Bank; (b) world economic conditions; (c) the effects of the Bank-supported program; and (d) internal shocks to the economy. After explicitly controlling for external shocks and nonprogram determinants of performance, the authors find that adjustment lending programs have usually increased the growth rate of GDP and the ratio of exports to GDP, and have increased the saving-to-GDP ratio over early 1980 s levels. But the average ratio of investment to GDP has fallen below 1970 s levels. For countries that have reduced most of their policy inefficiencies, achieving a sustainable growth rate in the 1990 s will require higher investment rates than those achieved in the 1980 s.

40|$|A {{range of}} {{countries}} have sought more equitable governance of their natural resources, by devolving decision-making and resource control to local populations. In 1994, Cameroon adopted {{a new law}} granting local communities the possibility of greater control over forests, principally in response to donor conditionality on <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Loans</b> (SALs). However, {{the enactment of the}} law lacked signifi cant domestic support. Confl icting interests and Cameroon’s highly centralized administrative machinery have prevented effective devolution of forest management. In 2003, the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) and a consortium of institutional stakeholders started the Model Forest Project in Cameroon. This project is part of the International Model Forest Network (IMFN). The goal of the IMFN is to assist in the development of sustainable management of forests around the world, while taking into account the needs of local communities. In 2005, the government of Cameroon recognized Campo Ma’an and Dja et Mpomo as model forest sites. The partnership involved, policy dimensions, government commitment, accomplishment to date and its contributions to national and sub regional forestry programmes are discussed...|$|R
40|$|International {{financial}} institutions (IFIs) like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are increasingly involved in post-conflict and peacebuilding situations. The IMF will often provide various conditional loans to post-conflict countries {{in order to}} mitigate {{the effects of the}} economic crises that are so common in that context. Additionally, in 1995 the IMF established the Emergency Assistance program, which is specifically targeted to post-conflict countries. The World Bank is also very present in countries emerging from conflict: it is estimated {{about a quarter of the}} World Bank’s concessional lending, excluding that to India and China, is directed to post-conflict countries (Boyce and Pastor, 1998, p. 4). In post-conflict countries, most IMF programs, and a quarter to a third of the World Bank’s programs, come in the form of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> plans (SAPs). <b>Structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>loans</b> are conditional loans geared to the reform of economic policies, collectively called SAPs, in the recipient country, generally through widespread economic liberalization. Countries after a period of civil war are notoriously fragile. In addition to the high number of direct and indirect casualties of war, the large number of refugees and internally displaced persons, the de-legitimization of political institutions, and the deep social divisions and trauma...|$|R
