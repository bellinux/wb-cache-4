40|$|Powerformer(R), a new {{high-voltage}} generator, {{was presented}} by ABB. It offers {{a direct connection}} to the power network {{without the need for}} a <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer.</b> In a sense, Powerformer incorporates into one unit the functions of both the conventional generator and the <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer.</b> Thanks to its ability to generate electricity at transmission voltage levels, a power plant utilizing Powerformer offers considerable gains with respect to reactive power production and plant efficiency.

50|$|A common {{modified}} {{sine wave}} inverter topology found in consumer power inverters is as follows:An onboard microcontroller rapidly switches on and off power MOSFETs at high frequency like ~50 kHz. The MOSFETs directly pull from a low voltage DC source (such as a battery). This signal then goes through <b>step-up</b> <b>transformers</b> (generally many smaller transformers are placed in parallel to reduce the overall size of the inverter) to produce a higher voltage signal. The output of the <b>step-up</b> <b>transformers</b> then gets filtered by capacitors to produce a high voltage DC supply. Finally, this DC supply is pulsed with additional power MOSFETs by the microcontroller to produce the final modified sine wave signal.|$|E

50|$|The {{transformer}} {{which is}} actually used in the so-called three-times resonance circuit has a flat shape. Although the magnetic path structure is closed, the leakage of the magnetic flux is considerably more {{than that of the}} conventional type. The transformer therefore has a larger short circuit inductance value. The design (refer to figure of the “past generation of technology“) is such that the short circuit inductance value of the <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> is increased to some degree, whereby a resonance circuit is created by the short circuit inductance (Lsc in the figures) and a capacitance component obtained on the secondary side of the <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer.</b> The resonance frequency of the circuit is set to a frequency three times as high as the operating frequency of the inverter circuit in order to generate a third-order harmonic in the secondary side circuit. The lamp current waveform has a trapezoid shape. The ballast capacitor Crb also functions as a resonance capacitor. As a result the conversion efficiency of the inverter circuit is considerably improved, and the <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> is further miniaturized.|$|R
30|$|Both the {{increment}} in the SCR and the short-circuit {{power is}} not so pronounced. This due to the <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> positive sequence reactance, which diminishes the short-circuit power contribution at the high-voltage side of the transformer.|$|R
50|$|With {{the success}} of the plant the Nunns started {{installing}} similar systems at their other mining operations. In 1896 the Ames plant was rebuilt with a new three-phase system with new generators and induction motors along with <b>step-up</b> <b>transformers</b> to boost the power to 10,000 volts for longer distance transmission. The water supply was also expanded.|$|E

50|$|Capacitor {{discharge}} ignition was developed. It {{produces a}} rising voltage that {{is sent to}} the spark plug. CD system voltages can reach 60,000 volts. CD ignitions use <b>step-up</b> <b>transformers.</b> The step-up transformer uses energy stored in a capacitance to generate electric spark. With either system, a mechanical or electrical control system provides a carefully timed high-voltage to the proper cylinder. This spark, via the spark plug, ignites the air-fuel mixture in the engine's cylinders.|$|E
50|$|As the IEC60076-1 {{standard}} has stated, {{the notation}} is HV-LV in sequence. For example, a <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> with a wye-connected primary and a delta-connected secondary , is written as 'Dy1'. The 1 indicates the LV winding lags the HV by 30 degrees.|$|R

50|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of any voltage surge it is {{desirable}} to replace the Korndörfer motor starter circuit with an autotransformer that has a central switch circuit that disconnects redundant windings of the first starting stage from the circuit at the transition, thereby preventing any <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> connection and voltage escalation.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, {{the need for}} a sub-transmission network became apparent, and in 1967 the AEPB {{established}} its first 33 kV subtransmission lines and zone substations, supplied by three 11/33 kV <b>step-up</b> <b>transformers</b> at Ashburton substation. In 1971, the last 6.6 kV lines were converted to 11 kV. As irrigation loads increased and the subtransmission network was extended into the 1980s, two 110/33 kV grid connections were established at Ashburton and Cairnbrae, near Methven, to supply the network. The AEPB also established a 1.8 MW hydroelectric power station at Montalto in 1982.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{methods to}} monitor partial discharges (PDs) of important power plant components, such as generator stator windings, generator circuit-breaker, and <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer.</b> Two {{methods have been}} evaluated under practical conditions, using various sensors: (i) time-domain measurements followed by signal-processing to discriminate between PDs and interference, and (ii) a tunable narrow-bandwidth filter which can be tuned to a frequency where PDs are strong and interference is weak. For several generators, abnormal PD activity was observed. In all cases, the source of these PDs could be located, {{by means of the}} transit-time between various sensors. Examples of identified abnormal discharge activity are: (i) discharge activity between phase separations of a statorwinding, (ii) sparking inside a <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer,</b> and (iii) large PDs in a generator circuit-breaker.

5000|$|Zipernowsky, with Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri, all of Ganz and Company, were researching ways of {{increasing}} efficiency of electrical power transmission. They experimented with power supplies and current transformation, {{which led to}} the invention of the ZBD alternating current transformer in 1885. The ZBD system is based on a closed-iron ring core with an arbitrary diameter and a coil around the core, which conducts AC current. Their system converted higher voltage suitable for energy transmission to lower [...] "service"-level voltage (step-down transformer). Nikola Tesla then proposed the use of <b>step-up</b> <b>transformers,</b> which would output higher voltage current than they received.

5000|$|Anderson {{became one}} of the first cities in the Southeastern United States to have electricity. Electricity to Anderson was {{established}} by William C. Whitner in 1895 at a hydroelectric plant on the Rocky River giving the city the name [...] "The Electric City." [...] Anderson also became the first city in the world to supply a cotton gin by electricity. In 1895 Anderson Court House was renamed to Anderson. In 1897 Whitner's plant was upgraded with a 10,000 volt generating station at Portman Shoals. Whitner's power plant at Portman Shoals became the first hydroelectric plant to generate high voltage without <b>step-up</b> <b>transformers</b> in the United States. The Portman Dam was swept away in 1901 forcing Anderson to be in darkness until it was rebuilt in 1902.|$|E
50|$|In the past, 110-120 V was {{not high}} enough for {{high-power}} audio and television applications. Therefore, {{it was used}} to operate low-power audio equipment such as radio receivers.

50|$|Electricity is {{supplied}} to the grid at the adjacent Northeast Utilities-owned substation located {{directly behind the}} plant. All four units generate power at 13.8 kilovolts (kV). Units 1 and 10 supply power directly via the 13.8 kV local distribution system fed out of the substation. Unit 3, and since 2002 unit 2, supply power to the 115 kV transmission switchyard at the substation via generator <b>step-up</b> <b>transformers</b> (GSU). The plant can be started with no off-site power available and with only the on-site emergency diesel generator providing electricity to plant systems. As a result, the West Springfield plant is capable of starting and supplying power to local loads {{in the event of}} a complete grid failure or in the event that the utility substation through which it transmits power is isolated from the rest of the grid.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, the first turbo-alternators were {{nearing the end}} of their useful lives, and it was decided to redevelop the power station in 1938. In 1942, the SCC {{accepted}} the tender of Australian General Electric to supply a single 50-megawatt (MW), 50 Hz turbo-alternator manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company Limited of Trafford Park, Manchester, England; the order was confirmed in 1944. This order was doubled in 1945, then doubled again in 1947, to a total of four 50 MW Range-units. These units generated current at 33 kV, which was also the transmission voltage, as {{there was no room for}} <b>step-up</b> <b>transformers.</b> Steam was supplied by 4 Lopulco Pulverised fuel boilers each producing 430,000 lbs of steam per hour at 1250 psi and 950 °F. Delayed by a post-Second World War backlog, the first 50 MW turbo-alternator arrived from England in 1948, but the new building designed to house it, construction of which commenced in 1947, was not ready. The first of the 50 MW units was not commissioned until 1952, five years behind schedule, and the fourth unit was in service by 1955.|$|E

40|$|Today {{the use of}} {{generator}} circuit-breakers installed {{between a}} generator and the associated <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> is widespread because this offers many advantages {{with respect to the}} unit connection (i. e. an arrangement without a generator circuit-breaker) such as simplified operational procedures and better protection of power station equipment against the fault effects. The insertion of a switching device in the connection between generator and <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> exerts an influence on the type and magnitude of overvoltages that will occur. Thereby special consideration has to be given to the possibility of overvoltages being generated by the generator circuit-breaker itself during switching operations and by its sole presence while being in the open state. Those overvoltages are associated to electromagnetic fields which might interfere with surrounding equipment. The present paper specifically investigates the possible generation of those overvoltages. In order to make a thorough analysis the impact of capacitors installed at the terminals of the generator circuit-breakers is investigated...|$|R
40|$|An {{offshore}} wind turbine usually has the grid <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> integrated in the nacelle. This increases mechanical loading of the tower. In that context, a transformer-less, high voltage, highly-reliable and compact converter system for nacelle installation would be an attractive solution for large {{offshore wind}} turbines. This paper, therefore, presents a transformer-less grid integration topology for PMSG based large wind turbine generator systems using modular matrix converters. Each matrix converter module is fed from three generator coils of the PMSG which are phase shifted by 120 °. Outputs of matrix converter modules are connected in series to increase the output voltage and thus eliminate the need of a coupling <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer.</b> Moreover, dc-link capacitors found in conventional back-to-back converter topologies are eliminated in the proposed system. Proper multilevel output voltage generation and power sharing between converter modules are achieved through an advanced switching strategy. Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed modular matrix converter system, modulation method and control techniques. ...|$|R
40|$|Compared with {{conventional}} Class-A, Class-B, and Class-AB amplifiers, Class-D amplifier, {{also known as}} switching amplifier, employs pulse width modulation (PWM) technology and solid-state switching devices, capable of achieving much higher efficiency. However, PWM-based switching amplifier is usually designed for low-voltage application, offering a maximum output voltage of several hundred Volts. Therefore, a <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> is indispensably adopted in PWM-based Class-D amplifier to produce high-voltage output. In this paper, a switching amplifier without <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> is developed based on digital pulse step modulation (PSM) and hybrid multilevel converter. Under the control of input signal, cascaded power converters with separate DC sources operate in PSM switch mode to directly generate high-voltage and high-power output. The relevant topological structure, operating principle, and design scheme are introduced. Finally, a prototype system is built, which can provide power up to 1400 Watts and peak voltage up to ± 1700 Volts. And the performance, including efficiency, linearity, and distortion, is evaluated by experimental tests...|$|R
