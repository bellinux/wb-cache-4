5|$|In 1926, Coffin {{fell ill}} {{with a serious}} hip {{infection}} that forced her to curtail much of her physical activity and required a lengthy stay in hospital. She moved to a newly acquired house in New Haven, Connecticut, although she continued to maintain her office in New York and commuted there daily. Coffin often entertained guests in New Haven (and recruited several Connecticut notables as new clients), holding teas, cocktail parties, musical events and buffet suppers. The garden, which she had laid out herself, became the site of garden parties in the summer months. She preferred the company of young architects, artists, musicians and writers, though she could be curt towards those she took a dislike to; on one occasion, she snubbed Hilaire Belloc when he asked her which of his books <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>read.</b>|$|E
5|$|Postman's Park came to {{increased}} public notice in 2004 {{with the release}} of the BAFTA- and Golden Globe-winning film Closer, which stars Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Clive Owen, and is based on the 1997 play Closer by Patrick Marber. A key plot element in the film revolves around Postman's Park, in which it is revealed that the character Alice Ayres (played by Portman in the film) has in fact fabricated her identity based on Ayres's tablet on the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice, which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> {{at the time of her}} first meeting with Dan Woolf (Jude Law) at the start of the film.|$|E
5|$|The novel has {{pervasive}} lesbian themes, {{concentrating on}} eroticism and self-discovery. Waters {{was working on}} a PhD dissertation in English literature when she decided to write a story she would like to read. Employing her love for the variety of people and districts in London, she consciously chose an urban setting. As opposed to previous lesbian-themed fiction <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> where the characters escape an oppressive society to live apart from it, Waters chose characters who interact with their surroundings. She has acknowledged that the book imagines a lesbian presence and history in Victorian London where none was recorded. The main character's experiences in the theatrical profession and her perpetual motion through the city allow her to make observations on social conditions while exploring the issues of gender, sexism, and class difference.|$|E

25|$|Early in the {{investigation}} of Taunja Bennett's murder, Laverne Pavlinac read the news reports surrounding Taunja Bennett's death and saw it as an opportunity to force an end to the long-term abusive relationship she had been in with her live-in boyfriend, John Sosnovske. She set up a meeting with the investigating detectives and gave a false confession, using the details <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> in reports to give a detailed story of how Sosnovske forced her to help him rape, murder, and dispose of Bennett's body. Pavlinac and Sosnovske were convicted of the murder in February 1991. To avoid the possibility of facing the death penalty, Sosnovske pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to life in prison, while Pavlinac was sentenced to no less than 10 years, much more than she had anticipated.|$|E

She eventually requested initiation into the Craft, and though Gardner was hesitant at first, he agreed that they could meet during the winter {{at the home of}} Edith Woodford-Grimes. Valiente got on well with both Gardner and Woodford-Grimes, and having no objections to either ritual nudity or scourging (which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> about in a copy of Gardner's novel High Magic's Aid that he had given to her), she was initiated by Gardner into Wicca on Midsummer 1953. Valiente went on to join the Bricket Wood Coven.

25|$|Alan reveals to Dysart {{that during}} his youth, he had {{established}} his attraction to horses {{by way of}} his mother's biblical tales, a horse story that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> to him, Western movies, and his grandfather's interest in horses and riding. Alan's sexual training began with his mother who {{told him he could}} find true love and contentment by way of religious devotion and marriage. During this time, Alan also begins to develop a sexual attraction to horses, desiring to pet their thick coats, feel their muscular bodies, and smell their sweat. Alan reveals to Dysart that he had first encountered a horse at age six, on the beach. A rider approached him, and took him up on the horse. Alan was visibly excited, but his parents found him and Frank pulled him violently off the horse. The horse rider scoffed at the father and rode off.|$|E

500|$|Bill Moffat, a {{headmaster}} from Glasgow, had an {{idea for}} a children's television programme called The Norbridge Files.

Hastie liked the idea and showed it to her future husband Bill Ward, co-owner of her company Richmond Films and Television. When she requested a script, Moffat suggested that his 25-year-old son Steven, an English teacher, should write it. Hastie said that it was [...] "the best ever first script" [...] that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>read.</b>|$|E

Her father, Mark Baker, was a deeply religious man, although, according to one account, [...] "Christianity to him was warfare against sin, not a religion of human brotherhood." [...] In common with most women at the time Eddy was given little formal education, but said <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> widely at home. From childhood she lived with protracted ill health, complaining of chronic indigestion and spinal inflammation, and according to biographers experiencing fainting spells.

Fortune also corresponded with Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn, the Dutch esotericist who founded Eranos in Switzerland. She also renewed her interest in Jungian psychology, which was then growing in influence among the esoteric milieu, and was influenced by her reading of Friedrich Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy.|$|E

Bannon said, [...] "Both books completely obsessed me {{for the better part of}} two years." [...] Although recently married and on her way to having two children, she found the books struck a chord in her life and recognized emotions in herself that compelled her to write about them.
