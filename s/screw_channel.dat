By analyzing the {{forces on the}} solid-plug in the barrel channel and <b>screw</b> <b>channel,</b> the boundary conditions when the solid-plug is waived of being cut off on barrel wall, {{were found to have}} the capacity of the positive conveying. Experimental data were obtained using a specially designed extruder with a helically channeled barrel in the feeding zone and a pressure-adjustable die. The effects of the barrel channel geometry and friction coefficients on the conveying mechanism were presented and compared with the experimental results. The simulations showed that the positive conveying could be achieved after optimizing extruder designs. Compared with the traditional design with the friction-drag conveying, the throughput is higher while screw torque and energy consumption are decreased.

40|$|Statement of the Problem: One {{disadvantage}} of cement-retained crowns {{is the lack}} of predictable irretrievability. This problem can be overcome through designing a screw access hole in the metal substructure of cement-retained restoration and using porcelain stain to define this area.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of <b>screw</b> access <b>channel</b> filling method and cement type on retention of implant-supported fixed restorations.   Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 40 implant analogs were mounted in autopolymerizing acrylic resin blocks, and two-piece titanium abutments were placed in each implant analog. Twenty abutment samples were completely filled with silicone, and 20 other samples were filled partially. In each of the study groups, Temp Bond® eugenol-containing temporary cement was used for 10 samples, while in another 10 samples non-eugenol temporary cements were utilized. Prior to the retention test, samples were placed in the rmocycling machine with 1000 cycles for 24 h. Each sample was stretched using a Universal Pull-out Test Machine with a force of 5000 N. The required load for removing the crown was recorded. The data was analyzed USING two-way ANOVA and least square difference (α= 0. 05). Results: Among the four groups, the highest retention rate was observed in the group of partial <b>screw</b> access <b>channel</b> filling with eugenol cement. Also, the rate of retention in the group of complete <b>screw</b> access <b>channel</b> filling with non-eugenol cement was significantly lower than in any other group.

40|$|Owing to {{the higher}} {{requirements}} on dosage accuracy and material strength for products with microfeatures, {{the analysis of the}} solid conveying process in a microinjection moulding machine becomes more important. A discrete element modelling method discrete element modelling (DEM) for simulating polymer particles moving in an inclined narrow <b>screw</b> <b>channel</b> is developed. Adhesion and its effects on normal contact force and rolling friction are taken into account in the modelling, allowing considerations of more influencing factors on the solid conveying process, such as temperature. The straight gravity field in the real world is transformed into the twisted time dependent gravity field in an unfolded straight channel, avoiding the calculation expensiveness induced by the complex geometry of the <b>screw</b> <b>channel,</b> which is important for DEM simulations. These have not been carried out previously. Using the developed programmes, effects of screw axis inclination on the specific throughput of the solid pellets are investigated. It is found that a larger inclination angle can induce higher specific throughput, especially when the screw rotational speed is lower. However, a smaller inclination angle is beneficial for easier throughput control. The results can be used to optimise the design of the plasticating unit as well as the operation parameters of the microinjection moulding machine. In addition, experimental studies are also carried out in this approach. Results of simulations are compared with those of experiments for verifying the accuracy of the simulation model.

Purpose: To {{determine if a}} novel technique combining the attributes of a cement-retained implant restoration fabricated extraorally and delivered to the patient as a screw-retained implant restoration has the necessary strength to provide a clinically acceptable and predicable restoration. Materials and Methods: Thirty specimens were fabricated and tested in this novel implant restoration technique, in which stock abutment was scanned using a bench top laboratory scanner and 30 lithium disilicate full contour crowns were designed and milled. In the first experimental group, the occlusal access channel was prepared in a pre-sintered crown using new high-speed diamond burs in a high-speed handpiece with ample irrigation as to keep the specimen cool. The access channel was prepared by the same operator for every specimen and the diameter was recorded. The specimens were allowed to air dry for 48 hours prior to being glazed, fired and finished. In the second experimental group, the <b>screw</b> access <b>channel</b> was prepared after the crown was fired and finished. In the control group, no <b>screw</b> access <b>channel</b> was prepared. Each finished crown intaglio surface was silinated per manufacturer specifications and luted with self-adhesive resin cement to its corresponding stock abutment. The cement was allowed to cure for at least 24 hours before testing. Each specimen was individually mounted in a custom-fabricated testing fixture and tested to failure on a servo-hydraulic testing system for static and dynamic tests. Each specimen was vertically loaded at a dynamic rate of 0. 100 mm/min until failure and the highest force reached {{at the point of}} failure was recorded. Statistical analysis was performed by consultants from the Biostatistical Design and Analysis Center. Results: A total of thirty CAD/CAM lithium disilicate crowns were fabricated and tested to failure. The first experimental group had a mean failure of 990. 64 N. The second experimental group had a mean failure of 1167. 65, and the control group had a mean failure of 188. 68 N. A two-sample t-test was used to compare the load among the three groups and because there are 3 comparisons, Bonferroni method is applied to adjust p-values for multiple comparisons. The results show that experimental group # 1, experimental group # 2 and the control group are statistically significantly different from each other. The diameter of the <b>screw</b> access <b>channel</b> did not make a statistically significant difference, most likely because the difference among the diameter wasn't that great between samples. Conclusions: The null hypothesis stated there will be no difference in the axial force required to fracture a lithium disilicate crown with and without a <b>screw</b> access <b>channel</b> prepared. The results of this study support rejecting the null hypothesis and accepting the alternative hypothesis. The preparation of a <b>screw</b> access <b>channel</b> in a lithium disilicate crown has statistical significance and reduces the axial load capacity from a crown without occlusal access.

30|$|Nowadays, implant screw-retained {{prosthesis}} {{becomes a}} popular mode of implant supra-structure restoration. Cement retained implant restoration has issues including irretrievability and difficulty {{of controlling the}} cement excess beyond the abutment joint. The cement excess can be {{a major cause of}} peri-implantitis [13 – 15]. Screw-retained implant restoration has also some disadvantages including the difficulty to get a right positioning of the access-hole compatible with a suitable aesthetic appearance and the aesthetic result of the access-hole restoration [16]. Inclined abutment or angling the <b>screw</b> <b>channel</b> can be an option to ameliorate the aesthetical outcomes [17, 18]. Moving the access hole to an occlusal or palatal/lingual zone would increase the indication of screw retained implant restoration. The development of the computer-assisted implant surgery increases the use of the screw-retained prosthesis compared to the cement retained method [19, 20]. Nevertheless, the integrity of the filling of the access hole is necessary to preserve to occlusal function and the aesthetic outcomes. Moreover, the access hole filling contributes to reinforce the surrounding ceramic [9].|$|E

40|$|The Buss cokneader is a {{single-screw}} extruder with interrupted flights. Pins from the barrel are {{inserted into the}} <b>screw</b> <b>channel.</b> The screw is both rotating and oscillating. Due to this action, screw flights are continuously wiped by the pins.

However, a more comprehensive model can start with the same equations that apply to the corotating twin-screw extruder (3).

40|$|BACKGROUND Medial open wedge high tibial {{osteotomy}} is {{a well-established}} procedure {{for the treatment}} of unicompartmental osteoarthritis and symptomatic varus malalignment. We hypothesized that different fixation devices generate different fixation stability profiles for the various wedge sizes in a finite element (FE) analysis. METHODS Four types of fixation were compared: 1) first and 2) second generation Puddu plates, and 3) TomoFix plate with and 4) without bone graft. Cortical and cancellous bone was modelled and five different opening wedge sizes were studied for each model. Outcome measures included: 1) stresses in bone, 2) relative displacement of the proximal and distal tibial fragments, 3) stresses in the plates, 4) stresses on the upper and lower screw surfaces in the <b>screw</b> <b>channels.</b> RESULTS The highest load for all fixation types occurred in the plate axis. For {{the vast majority of the}} wedge sizes and fixation types the shear stress (von Mises stress) was dominating in the bone independent of fixation type. The relative displacements of the tibial fragments were low (in μm range). With an increasing wedge size this displacement tended to increase for both Puddu plates and the TomoFix plate with bone graft. For the TomoFix plate without bone graft a rather opposite trend was observed. For all fixation types the occurring stresses at the screw-bone contact areas pulled at the screws and exceeded the allowable threshold of 1. 2 MPa for at least one screw surface. Of the six screw surfaces that were studied, the TomoFix plate with bone graft showed a stress excess of one out of twelve and without bone graft, five out of twelve. With the Puddu plates, an excess stress occurred in the majority of screw surfaces. CONCLUSIONS The different fixation devices generate different fixation stability profiles for different opening wedge sizes. Based on the computational simulations, none of the studied osteosynthesis fixation types warranted an intransigent full weight bearing per se. The highest fixation stability was observed for the TomoFix plates and the lowest for the first generation Puddu plate. These findings were revealed in theoretical models and need to be validated in controlled clinical settings...|$|R

40|$|In the {{previous}} paper (1) the melting {{performance of a}} number of recent screw designs was analyzed, using a rather simple theory. A new screw design was proposed. Here the results of more elaborate calculations are given in which the influence of the flight clearance and of a shear-thinning temperature dependent viscosity are investigated. The former conclusions are not altered in essence by these effects. Experimental results with a prototype screw are presented, showing that melting capacity is increased. Up to 100 percent increase in throughput is possible in the high RPM range (in comparison with a much longer traditional compression screw), provided that the feed capacity is sufficient. This usually requires the use of a grooved, well-cooled, feed section; the capacity of such a feed section depends, for a given <b>screw</b> geometry, on <b>channel</b> depth and granule dimensions.

The influence of the flight clearance is demonstrated[2, 3], {{and the effects of}} flight clearance and temperature are shown with finite difference methods for two-dimensional flow of power-law viscosity[5]. A macro-energy equation is used to discuss power and heat, but details of quantifying calculations are not presented[6]. This final approach is basic to the starting point of this work.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{injection}} moulding, {{long glass}} fibre reinforced thermoplastics (LGFT) are an attractive way to produce large parts at low cost. However {{the strength of the}} part depends chiefly on the average fibre length, fibres which are subjected to considerable attrition during processing in conventional three stage screws. In this study, two models of fibre breakage are considered: The first mechanism is specific to plastication during which a fibre anchored at one end in the solid bed is submitted at the other end to the intense shear existing in the molten film, close to the barrel. The thickness of the molten film and the shear stress applied to the fibre vary with polymer viscosity, fibre strength and dimensions, and process parameters. As the melting of the solid bed progresses, more fibres are unlayered and submitted to bending. When the bending stress applied exceeds the fibre strength, the fibre breaks. This results in bimodal fibre length distributions. The sensibility of the model to main processing parameters such as screw rotation, initial fibre length, viscosity, barrel temper-ature and screw geometry is also investigated. The second mechanism addresses the fibre breakage occurring at a later stage in the process, when the <b>screw</b> <b>channel</b> is completely filled with melt. The basis for this {{is to look at the}} fibre as an array of bonded spheres. The flexibility of the fibre model is altered by changing the bending, stretching and twisting strength of the bond connecting adjacent spheres. The motion of the fibre in the flow field is determined by solving the translational and rotational motion equations for individual spheres under hydrodynamic forces and torques exerted on them. Again, the fibre fractures at the bond at which the applied stress exceeds the fibre strength...|$|E

40|$|Periprosthetic {{fractures}} {{represent a}} relevant clinical problem. Currently, the incidence is indicated with 0. 1 % - 4. 1 % for primary implantations and 2. 8 % - 4 % following revision surgery. With {{regard to the}} demographic change, {{the number of cases}} will continue to rise. Thus, periprosthetic fractures are and will remain a substantial burden on the healthcare system. The majority of previously published clinical studies clearly demonstrate that in addition to post-operative infections, implant failure {{is one of the leading}} complications following surgical treatment of these injuries. This provides a major challenge for the treating surgeon. The results of our clinical studies have shown that the majority of patients do not reach the functional level prior to the fracture. This is especially evident in the degree of postoperative mobility, in which the persons concerned are mostly dependent on walking aids. Analysis of the clinical results showed for the first time, however, that the functional outcome as well as the patient-specific quality of life are independent of the type of surgical treatment performed. It seems that a complication-free postoperative course is much more essential to influence these parameters. Against this background, the experimental studies have been designed, which deal with the critical aspects of the periprosthetic fracture stabilization: the implant anchorage in the area of the prosthesis itself as well as to optimize the biomechanical environment in comminuted and simple fracture types. The aim was to reduce the rate of mechanical complications by optimizing the osteosynthetic anchorage and the mechanobiologic environment while preserving the principles of biological osteosynthesis to fully exploit the healing potential of each individual patient. The critical implant anchorage in the inset of prosthetic components represents one of the fundamental weaknesses of the osteosynthetic reconstruction. Polyaxial bicortical screw anchorage in the area of the prosthetic stem clearly showed its superiority over the monocortical monoaxial anchoring. We were able to demonstrate for the first time, that in the event of implant failure the bicortical screw fixation leads to complex fracture patterns, which significantly complicates or even precludes revision surgery. However, this type of anchorage is already widely used in clinical practice. First studies documenting the results of this technique show promising results. It remains uncleare whether the experimentally proven problem will actually result in a clinical one. Nevertheless, the results of our study should be adhered to and it is recommended that possible <b>screw</b> <b>channels</b> and -angulations should be checked by imaging methods preoperatively. Complex fracture patterns are treated according to the current concept of bridging osteosynthesis. The aim is to create a biomechanical environment that stimulates the formation of callus. So far, there is no evidence regarding the working length that should be selected to provide such an environment. The study presented could for the first time define a range of working lengths for the stabilization of a periprosthetic femoral fracture, which leads to interfragmentary movements in the fracture gap, similar to those published. For the first time physiological stress was applied on the construct to allow a most realistic analysis. Furthermore, it could be shown that the variation in the remaining (not defining the working length) screws on the shaft are of secondary importance and do not exert any significant influence on the motion at the fracture site. However, a totally different situation is found in simple fracture types. While respecting the concept of biological osteosynthesis using modern percutaneous reduction techniques an anatomical reduction can be achieved in many cases. Unlike comminuted situations it has to be discussed whether interfragmentary compression can lead to improved healing rates. However, in first place, it has to be clarified whether interfragmentary compression has a significant impact on stability in a locking plate construct. In an experimental setup on human cadaver bone this could be validated (significant improvement in construct stiffness) for the first time. Similar to the analysis of the comminuted fracture situation the results of this study also showed a significant reduction of the resulting shear movements. In selected working lengths the combination with interfragmentary compression can lead to stiffness values comparable to intact bone. Thus, an environment can be created which may induce primary bone healing. These fundamental gained in vitro findings can optimize the osteosynthetic reconstruction of periprosthetic fractures and thus lead to improved clinical function and consecutively to a higher patient-specific quality of life by reducing the overall complication rate...|$|R

The general method to produce holes in metal cutting is by drilling operations. Indexable insert drills are often used to make short holes at a low cost. However, indexable drills are prone to vibrate under certain circumstances, causing vibrations that affect tool life. Therefore, a good prediction of cutting-forces in drilling is important {{to get a good}} description of the cutting process for optimization of tool body and insert design. Reliable simulations of dynamic forces also aid in prediction of chatter vibrations that have significant effects {{on the quality of the}} manufactured parts as well as the tool life. In this paper, a mechanistic approach is used to model the cutting-forces. Cutting-force coefficients are identified from measured instantaneous forces in drilling operations. These coefficients are used for simulating torque around drill-axis, axial force and cutting-forces in the plane perpendicular to drill-axis. The forces are modeled separately for peripheral and central insert, which results in a detailed description of the cutting-forces acting on each insert. The forces acting on each insert are estimated by dividing the cutting edges into small segments and the cutting-forces acting on each segment are calculated. The total forces are predicted by summation of the forces acting on each segment. Simulated torque and forces are compared to measured cutting-forces for two different feeds. A good agreement between predicted and experimental results, especially in torque and axial-force, is observed...|$|R
40|$|Several {{types of}} {{posterior}} approaches {{have been adopted}} for occipitocervical fusion. Prior to this study, Foerater et al. in 1927 used a fibular strut graft in the site between the occiput and the lower cervical spine to achieve fusion. Since then, various techniques including wrings, Hartshill loop, AO reconstructive plate, and AXIS occipital plate were described and used widely. As far as we know, all these techniques involve the screw placement vertical to the diploic bone; however none has ever addressed the feasibility of screw placement in occiput parallelling to the diploic bone. In our study, 30 dry specimens of human occiputs were measured manually using vernier calipers and protractors. The intradiploic screw was first supposed to be inserted inferiorly to the superior nuchal line (SNL) prominence. The entry point located at the superior edge of the SNL prominence. Afterward, the measurements of extracranial occiput in SNL area on midline and bilateral 15  mm to the midline saggital-cutting planes of the occiput were conducted. The thickness of the occipital bone {{at the location of}} SNL prominence, the entry point, the exit point and the screw orientation were measured, respectively. Afterward, 11 patients with craniocervical malformation were treated surgically using this alternative and their X-ray radiographs and CT scans were evaluated postoperatively. The data showed that the occipital at the site of SNL prominence was the thickest. The thickest point was external occipital protuberance (EOP), which was up to 14  mm. The thickness decreased gradually from the site of SNL to the superior border of surgical decompressed area. The actual length of <b>screw</b> <b>channel</b> was about 26  mm. The mean thickness for safe screw insertion ranged from 5. 73 to 14. 14  mm. A total of 22 intraocciput screws parallel to diploic bone were placed precisely, without injury to the cerebral and inner occipital venous sinus. The results confirm that occiput is available for holding intraocciput screw paralleling to diploic bone...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Typical {{stabilisation}} of pelvic {{open book}} injuries consists of plate fixation of the symphysis. No previous literature {{has been published}} about the evaluation of screw placement and their trajectory with four oblique 4. 5  mm screws using a four-hole plate in symphysis diastasis. The {{aim of this study}} was to define insertion points and angles of trajectory for crossed screw placement regardless of any plate design based on an analysis of three-dimensional computed tomography data sets. METHODS One hundred human pelvic CT data sets were collected. Unilateral and bilateral placements of crossed 4. 5  mm screws were simulated. Primary outcome measure was successful simulated screw placement without cortical breach. Secondary outcome measures included the anatomical measurements of the screw positions. RESULTS Simulated screw placement of two oblique screws on each side of the pubic symphysis without cortical breach was achieved in all (100  %) cases. There were a total of 400 screw simulations. Medial screws were longer, lateral screws had higher coronal angles, and the distance between both screws was higher on the right side (p <  0. 001 each). The lengths of the right lateral, right medial, left lateral, and left medial screws were 44. 9, 65. 8, 45. 4, and 67. 4  mm, respectively. The sagittal angles to the dorsal surface area of the pubic rami were 10. 5 °, 11. 1 °, 9. 0 °, and 11. 0 °. The coronal angles to the vertical axis of the symphysis measured 39. 5 °, 16. 0 °, 33. 8 °, and 16. 8 °. The distances between these screws and the medial edge of the pubic crest were 33. 5, 8. 6, 29. 5, and 7. 3  mm. Furthermore, certain sex- and side-related differences were noted. CONCLUSIONS This series provides results about the feasibility and a detailed anatomical description of crossed screw placement. This is of special interest in pelvic surgery for choosing the entry points, safe <b>screw</b> <b>channel</b> parameters, and trajectories...|$|E
40|$|Fluoroscopy-based {{navigation}} {{systems can}} be used for internal fixation of intracapsular femoral neck fractures, with the object of optimizing positioning of the implant and reducing radiation exposure. With this technique, the virtual position and direction of a reamer can be simultaneously superimposed on anteroposterior (AP) and axial (AX) fluoroscopic images. However, surgeons have to rely on the accuracy of these systems, because the only intraoperative feedback on the true position of the reamer is the projection of a virtual reamer superimposed on two fluoroscopic images. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the accuracy of the displayed position of the virtual reamer in relation to the true position of the instrument when using a fluoroscopy-based navigation system (medivision, Oberdorf, Switzerland). Secondary to this, the accuracy of the drill-channel measuring tool of the system was analyzed. The study was performed on 20 sawbones. To evaluate the position of the virtual reamer, an 8 -mm Perspex bar was inserted in predefined drill channels in each sawbone. AP and AX fluoroscopic images of the sawbones with the Perspex bar were loaded into the workstation. The Perspex bar was then removed and exchanged for a navigated dynamic hip screw (DHS) reamer. The position of the Perspex bar in the images represented the true position of the reamer. Subsequently, the difference between the position of the virtual reamer and the Perspex bar was measured with a dedicated computer program. Drill-channel lengths measured with the system were compared with measurements obtained with a digital ruler. The mean difference in position of the Perspex bar and reamer at a predefined point was 0. 90 mm (range: 0. 00 - 3. 21 mm) in 360 images. The mean difference in length measurements between the medivision system and the digital ruler was 1. 00 mm (p = 0. 01, SD = 1. 33). Reaming and measuring the <b>screw</b> <b>channel</b> of a DHS with a medivision fluoroscopy-based navigation system can be performed with an acceptable error margi...|$|E

40|$|Drilling {{is widely}} used in {{manufacturing}} of products which need holes, for example for fluid <b>channels,</b> <b>screws</b> or pins. Depending on application, workpiece material, cutting parameters and economic considerations, different types of drills are employed. Indexable insert drills are types of drills which facilitate inserts to make holes. These types of drills can make high pitch noises due to vibrations. The focus of this thesis is to investigate the mechanism behind these vibrations {{in order to help}} reducing the generated noise in the future designs. Primary investigations show that the main mechanism which results the mentioned noise is regenerative chatter vibrations due to axial and torsional flexibilities. There is a gap in modeling of chatter vibrations in indexable drills where loadings and geometries are asymmetrical and due to torsional vibrations, delay terms are variable. The first step of simulating regenerative chatter vibrations in the drill is to model static cutting forces in a reliable way. In this thesis, a model is proposed which is capable of predicting static cutting forces through segmentation of cutting edges. Since, using this model, forces can be calculated separately on each insert, it is possible to consider differences of inserts in estimationof the cutting loads. The obtained loads are used in the chatter simulation. A model is proposed to simulate chatter vibrations by considering axialand angular deflections and the coupling between them. The resulted model isa system of delay differential equations with variable delays. Variations in timedelays, tool jump-outs and backward motions of inserts have been included inthe proposed time-domain simulation. A set of experiments is conducted toverify the model...|$|R
40|$|Dispensing any fluid {{material}} onto a mixed technology {{printed circuit}} board (PCB) substrate has two basic requirements: applying the material to the exact location required, and dispensing a dot of exact volume. Due to the decreasing pad sizes, and the typical density required in the material pattern, these are major challenges [3]. There are two basic types of dispensing mechanisms that are used for practical production: the Archimedes Metering Valve (AMV) and the Positive Displacement Pump [5]. The performance of the Archimedes Screw in the AMV depends {{a great deal on}} screw design and operating conditions. The principle geometric variables of the Archimedes <b>Screw</b> are the <b>channel</b> depths, i. e., the radial distance between the cylinder surface and root diameter of the screw, the pitch of the screw, the type of threads and the number of channels through which the material can flow. The dimensions of the nozzle, such as the nozzle ID and stand off height, and the rheological properties of the material also influence the parameters required for a consistent dot. Dispensing with an AMV is based on the laws of momentum, fluid dynamics, energy, and mass transport. The amount of material dispensed depends upon the pitch of threads, depth of cut, type of thread, length of screw, the number of starts, and angle of rotation of the screw. The quantity of material dispensed increases with an increase in depth of cut, decrease in pitch, increase in encoder counts, and increasing the number of channels. This paper studies the effect of different geometric variables of the screw, and the screw-nozzle combination that optimizes the quantity of material dispensed without affecting dot consistency...|$|R
