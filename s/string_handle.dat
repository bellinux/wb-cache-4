50|$|The macro {{language}} lacks {{support for}} user-defined functions {{and does not}} easily support include files. The <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> is prone to errors, especially with embedded control characters.|$|R
50|$|The C {{standard}} library provides macros, type {{definitions and}} functions for {{tasks such as}} <b>string</b> <b>handling,</b> mathematical computations, input/output processing, memory management, and several other operating system services.|$|R
50|$|As {{a general}} rule, the {{framework}} makes as much use as possible of the Standard Template Library, avoiding duplication {{of work on}} things like container classes, or <b>string</b> <b>handling.</b>|$|R
50|$|The PL/I {{language}} provides {{full support}} for pointers to all data types (including pointers to structures), recursion, multitasking, <b>string</b> <b>handling,</b> and extensive built-in functions. PL/I {{was quite a}} leap forward compared to the programming languages of its time.|$|R

50|$|A later {{derivative}} of TELCOMP called STRINGCOMP was oriented towards <b>string</b> <b>handling.</b> Another BBN JOSS-derivative called FILECOMP {{was developed for}} the GE MEDINET system, which was cancelled. The implicit file handling system it contained was influential on the MUMPS global database system.|$|R
50|$|The C++ {{programming}} language has support for <b>string</b> <b>handling,</b> mostly implemented in its standard library. The language standard specifies several string types, some inherited from C, some newly {{designed to make}} use of the language's features, such as templates and the RAII resource management idiom.|$|R
50|$|It {{was one of}} {{the three}} {{variants}} of JOSS II (along with TELCOMP and FILECOMP) that were developed by BBN. It had extended <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> capabilities to augment JOSS's mathematical focus. It was a strong influence {{in the development of the}} programming language MUMPS.|$|R
5000|$|ThinBASIC {{does offer}} the main flow control statements, such as SELECT CASE, IF ... THEN/ELSEIF/ELSE/END IF, loops (infinite, conditional, FOR, WHILE/WEND, DO/LOOP WHILE ..., DO/LOOP UNTIL ...) {{and it also}} puts very strong effort on {{providing}} wide range of built-in functions for number crunching and especially <b>string</b> <b>handling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... func2 takes a pointer to a {{constant}} character array {{as well as}} an integer and returns a pointer to a character, and is assigned to a C <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> function which returns a pointer to the first occurrence of a given character in a character array.|$|R
50|$|The OCPJP 6 exam tests a {{candidate}} on knowledge of declarations, access control, object orientation, assignments, operators, flow control, assertions, <b>string</b> <b>handling,</b> I/O, parsing, formatting, generics, collections, inner classes, threads and the JDK tools. The test {{is available in}} English, Japanese, Chinese, German, Korean, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.|$|R
50|$|Integration {{with the}} JVM {{platform}} is tight, and all existing Java class libraries {{can be used}} unchanged and without special setup; at the same time, a Java programmer can opt to just use the Rexx class from the runtime package for improved <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> in Java syntax source programs.|$|R
25|$|Although any {{programming}} language {{can be used}} on the server to process a form's data, the most commonly used languages are scripting languages, which tend to have stronger <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> functionality than {{programming language}}s such as C, and also have automatic memory management which helps to prevent buffer overrun attacks.|$|R
30|$|Still {{there is}} scope {{to extend the}} support to other {{composite}} operations of <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> and char handling. Also there is need to support better data structures.

5000|$|... {{will fail}} because the second call to [...] (which {{converts}} a floating-point value to a string) overwrites the string returned {{by the first}} call before SomeFunction can do something with it. QuakeC does not contain any <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> functions or file handling functions, which were simply not needed by the original game.|$|R
50|$|The Small Basic {{standard}} library includes basic {{classes for}} mathematics, <b>string</b> <b>handling,</b> and input/output, {{as well as}} more exotic classes that are intended to make using the language more fun for learners. Examples of these include a Turtle graphics class, a class for retrieving photos from Flickr, and classes for interacting with Microsoft Kinect sensors.|$|R
50|$|Although {{it appears}} similar to source code in some {{high-level}} programming languages, more complex PASM programs will resemble other assembly languages. The main {{exceptions to this}} low level programming in PASM are <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> and, as shown above, input and output. Additionally, PASM has automatic garbage collection from the virtual machine, {{and it does not}} allow pointer arithmetic.|$|R
30|$|ABTS is {{the best}} <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> OT algorithm. The swapDD {{function}} of ABTS is proposed to swap two deletions, but swapDD fails totally if there exist partial overlapping between two deletions. In addition, it fails if one deletion operation string is totally covered by other deletion operation string. In few other cases, also swapDD fails at boundary conditions.|$|R
50|$|On the {{positive}} side, full support for pointers to all data types (including pointers to structures), recursion, multitasking, <b>string</b> <b>handling,</b> and extensive built-in functions PL/I was indeed quite a leap forward {{compared to the}} programming languages of its time. However, these were not enough to convince a majority of programmers or shops to switch to PL/I.|$|R
50|$|UTF-16 and UTF-32 are {{incompatible}} with ASCII files, and thus require Unicode-aware programs to display, print and manipulate them, {{even if the}} file is known to contain only characters in the ASCII subset. Because they contain many zero bytes, the strings cannot be manipulated by normal null-terminated <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> for even simple operations such as copy.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to make C <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> less error prone. One strategy is to add safer and more useful functions such as [...] and , while [...] deprecating the use of unsafe functions such as [...] Another is to add an object-oriented wrapper around C strings so that only safe calls can be done.|$|R
50|$|With the Quake engine {{source code}} {{now able to}} be changed, further {{features}} were added to QuakeC {{in the form of}} new built-in functions. Features long yearned for by QuakeC coders finally reached realization as QuakeC now had file and <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> functions, enlarged <b>string</b> buffers, more math functions, and so on. However, programmers taking advantage of these changes lost backwards compatibility with the unmodified Quake engine.|$|R
50|$|Boehm GC is also {{distributed}} with a C <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> library called cords. This {{is similar}} to ropes in C++ (strings are trees of small arrays, and they never change), but instead of using reference counting for proper deallocation, it relies on garbage collection to free objects. Cords are good at handling very large texts, modifications {{to them in the}} middle, slicing, concatenating, and keeping history of changes (undo/redo functionality).|$|R
50|$|The {{language}} {{itself has}} {{the appearance of}} ALGOL or Pascal, with BEGIN and END statements. However, its semantics are far more like C. It does not permit indefinite levels of procedure nesting, it does not pass complex structured arguments by value, {{and it does not}} strictly type most variable references. Programming techniques are much like C using pointers to structures, occasional overlays, deliberate <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> and casts when appropriate.|$|R
50|$|UBASIC version 8 has the high-precision {{real and}} complex {{arithmetic}} (up to 2600 digits) of prior versions, and adds exact rational arithmetic and arithmetic of single-variable polynomials with complex, rational, or modulo p coefficients, {{as well as}} <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> and limited list handling abilities. In also has context-sensitive on-line documentation (read UBHELP.DOC for information). The file that this uses is ASCII and can be printed for a paper document.|$|R
5000|$|C programmers draw a sharp {{distinction}} between a [...] "string", aka a [...] "string of characters", which by definition is always null terminated, vs. a [...] "byte string" [...] or [...] "pseudo string" [...] which may be stored in the same array but is often not null terminated.Using C <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> functions on such a [...] "byte string" [...] often seems to work, but later leads to security problems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] A {{pattern-matching}} {{feature for}} the Prolog language is described. Through {{the use of}} patterns, introduced as Prolog predicates, the feature favors the specification f <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> algorithms in a declarative style. A number of convenient pre-defined patterns, adapted from SNOBOL 4, are included. The use of two-level grammars as a paradigm for developing Prolog programs incorporating the pattern-matching feature is also discussed.

5000|$|Generally, a [...] is more {{efficient}} than a <b>String</b> in <b>string</b> <b>handling.</b> However, {{this is not necessarily}} the case, since a StringBuffer will be required to recreate its character array when it runs out of space. Theoretically, this is possible to happen the same number of times as a new String would be required, although this is unlikely (and the programmer can provide length hints to prevent this). Either way, the effect is not noticeable in modern desktop computers.|$|R
30|$|A logical {{next step}} for Hidost is its {{implementation}} and evaluation on other hierarchically structured file formats. Of particular significance {{would be an}} application to formats used by Microsoft Office, as they are widely used for recent targeted attacks. A conceptual design for this application was proposed in this paper. Looking beyond, {{the development of more}} advanced <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> methods might prove indispensable to enable detection of malware in formats whose logical structure and numerical content do not provide enough discriminative power.|$|R
5000|$|An {{application}} {{developed in}} Delphi or C++ Builder will typically use the default memory manager which is FastMM4. FastCode {{functions in the}} RTL have been selected {{to be the most}} commonly used ones and an application will also typically use some of these, especially if any <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> is done. Most Delphi/C++ Builder applications will therefore use code developed by the FastCode project. Some examples are Skype, FL Studio, and Embarcadero’s own RAD Studio. Hallvard's blog describes FastMM4 and why it is being used as the memory manager in [...] "The Online Trader" [...] application.|$|R
