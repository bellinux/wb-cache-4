5|$|In {{addition}} to hosting photosynthesizing endosymbionts, sponges are noted for their {{wide range of}} collaborations with other organisms. The relatively large encrusting sponge Lissodendoryx colombiensis is most common on rocky surfaces, but has extended its range into <b>seagrass</b> meadows by letting itself be surrounded or overgrown by <b>seagrass</b> sponges, which are distasteful to the local starfish and therefore protect Lissodendoryx against them; in return the <b>seagrass</b> sponges get higher positions away from the sea-floor sediment.|$|E
5|$|Lobatus gigas {{lives at}} depths from 0.3–18m to 25–35m. Its depth range {{is limited by}} the {{distribution}} of <b>seagrass</b> and algae cover. In heavily exploited areas, the queen conch is more abundant in the deepest range. The queen conch lives in <b>seagrass</b> meadows and on sandy substrate, usually in association with turtle grass (species of the genus Thalassia, specifically Thalassia testudinum and also Syringodium sp.) and manatee grass (Cymodocea sp.). Juveniles inhabit shallow, inshore <b>seagrass</b> meadows, while adults favor deeper algal plains and <b>seagrass</b> meadows.|$|E
5|$|The Laguna Madre {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and unspoiled lagoon ecosystems in Texas. It is also one of the most protected in the United States; 75% of its shores are protected by the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge to the west and the Padre Island National Seashore on the east. Fish, shrimp and crab, which feed the bird populations, depend on the lagoon and its plentiful beds of <b>seagrass</b> for survival. The <b>seagrass</b> of Laguna Madre accounts for 80% of all <b>seagrass</b> found off the Texas Coast; however, it is threatened by brown tides caused by poor circulation and dredging. An influx of seawater can sometimes replace the vital <b>seagrass</b> with oyster beds.|$|E
40|$|<b>Seagrasses</b> are {{flowering}} plants that thrive in shallow oceanic and estuarine waters around the world. Descendants of terrestrial plants that re-entered the ocean between 100 and 65 million years ago, <b>seagrasses</b> have leaves, stems, rhizomes (horizontal underground runners) and roots.

The three <b>seagrasses</b> were Halophilia engelmannii, Halodule wrightii, and Syringodium filiforme. These <b>seagrasses</b> form an excellent experimental system as their areas of dominance fall more or less along a natural gradient of UV-B and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) penetration. The sensitivity of photosynthesis in the <b>seagrasses</b> was determined and their photosynthetic response to levels of UV-B simulating atmospheric ozone depletion was monitored. Further experiments explore the possible attenuation or repair of UV-B induced photosynthetic inhibition by PAR, the role of epiphytic growth upon <b>seagrasses</b> as a protective UV-B shield, and the inhibition of photosynthesis in response to UV-A is studied...|$|R
5|$|The smooth toadfish {{is found}} along Australia's eastern and {{southeast}} coast, from Moreton Bay in southeastern Queensland to Port Lincoln in South Australia {{as well as}} Kangaroo Island and Tasmania. It {{is one of the}} most abundant fishes in the muddy areas of Port Philip Bay. It generally lives in shallow water less than 3m (10ft) deep, often over mudflats in estuaries. In areas of <b>seagrass</b> beds, smooth toadfish are more commonly found in sand areas bordering on the <b>seagrass</b> patches. They are more commonly found in <b>seagrass</b> patches in water less than 1.5m (5ft) deep rather than deeper water of 3.5–6m (11–20ft). A South Australian field study on wrack and associated fauna found that the smooth toadfish was associated with larger volumes and aggregations containing green algae.|$|E
5|$|Its large range, {{abundance}} and stable population mean the smooth toadfish {{is classified as}} Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Although no decline in numbers has been recorded, the effects of disappearance of its habitat—mangroves and <b>seagrass</b> beds—is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{communities}} have been classified into nine categories: lowland subtropical rainforest, submontane rainforest, cloud-forest and scrub, lowland swamp forest, mangrove scrub and <b>seagrass,</b> coastal scrub and cliff vegetation, inland scrub and herbland, offshore island vegetation, shoreline and beach vegetation, and disturbed vegetation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Seagrasses</b> are {{flowering}} plants {{from one of}} four plant families which grow in marine environments. They are called <b>seagrasses</b> because the leaves are long and narrow and are very often green, and because the plants often grow in large meadows which look like grassland. Since <b>seagrasses</b> photosynthesize and are submerged, they must grow submerged in the photic zone, where there is enough sunlight. For this reason, most occur in shallow and sheltered coastal waters anchored in sand or mud bottoms.|$|R
5|$|The dog conch {{lives on}} muddy sand bottoms among algae and <b>seagrass</b> beds on insular and {{continental}} shores. It usually prefers major islands and continental coasts {{rather than the}} shores of small islands, although {{this is not an}} absolute rule. L.canarium prefers areas of mixed seagrasses (with a predominance of Halophila), and also prefers sediment with high levels of organic matter. This conch avoids environments with a high density of Enhalus acoroides, a large <b>seagrass</b> native to coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific. The dog conch can be found in littoral and sublittoral zones, from shallow water to a depth of 55m (180ft). It is normally found in large colonies, and is usually abundant wherever it occurs.|$|E
5|$|Mud plume feeding is {{a feeding}} {{technique}} {{performed by a}} small community of bottlenose dolphins over shallow <b>seagrass</b> beds (less than 1 m) in the Florida Keys in the United States. The behavior involves creation of a U-shaped plume of mud {{in the water column}} and then rushing through the plume to capture fish.|$|E
5|$|The thread-sail {{filefish}} is an omnivore, and can feed on plant or animal matter. Its diet includes kelp, but consists mainly of amphipods such as gammarids and skeleton shrimp, {{as well as}} the <b>seagrass</b> species Zostera marina. The fish also feeds upon smaller organisms, including bryozoans and some species of serpulid tube worms.|$|E
50|$|Some {{fish species}} that visit/feed on <b>seagrasses</b> raise their young in {{adjacent}} mangroves or coral reefs. Also, <b>seagrasses</b> trap sediment and slow down water movement, causing suspended sediment to fall out. The trapping of sediment benefits coral by reducing sediment loads in the water.|$|R
50|$|Zosteraceae (one of {{the four}} <b>seagrasses</b> families, Kubitzki ed. 1998) is a family of marine {{perennial}} flowering plants found in temperate and subtropical coastal waters, with the highest diversity located around Korea and Japan. Most <b>seagrasses</b> complete their entire life cycle under water, having filamentous pollen especially adapted to dispersion in an aquatic environment and ribbon-like leaves that lack stomata. <b>Seagrasses</b> are herbaceous and have prominent creeping rhizomes. A distinctive characteristic of the family {{is the presence of}} characteristic retinacules, which are present in all species except members of Zostera subgenus Zostera.|$|R
5000|$|These unusual marine {{flowering}} plants are called <b>seagrasses</b> because in many species {{the leaves are}} long and narrow, grow by rhizome extension, and often grow in large [...] "meadows", which look like grassland: in other words, many of the species of <b>seagrasses</b> superficially resemble terrestrial grasses of the family Poaceae.|$|R
5|$|The whiskery shark is {{an active}} and highly {{specialized}} predator, feeding almost exclusively on octopuses. Other cephalopods, bony fishes, small rock lobsters, spoon worms, and <b>seagrass</b> have also been found amongst its stomach contents. A known parasite of this species is the tapeworm Calliobothrium pritchardae.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, the marbled {{electric}} ray inhabits rocky reefs and <b>seagrass</b> beds, as well as nearby areas with sandy or muddy bottoms. During warm summer months, pregnant females are known to migrate into Arcachon Bay in northwestern France, where they are commonly found in very shallow, muddy pools near oyster beds. This species may conduct a northward migration in summer and autumn, into {{the waters of the}} British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs form {{some of the}} world's most {{productive}} ecosystems. Common coral reef cnidarians include both Anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and Hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals). The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support {{a wide range of}} other organisms. Fringing reefs just below low-tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and <b>seagrass</b> from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and <b>seagrass</b> protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} nine species {{belonging}} to five genera from two families of <b>seagrasses</b> was {{collected from the}} three coastal regions of Myanmar. These are Cymodocea rotundata, C. serrulata, Halodule pinifolia, H. uninervis, Syringodium isotoefolium, Enhalus acoroides, Halophila beccarii, H. decipiens and H. ovalis. Due to turbid water by enormous sediment discharge of two greatest rivers, the Ayeyarwady and the Thanlwin, the subtidal vegetation of <b>seagrasses</b> is totally absent in the Ayeyarwady Delta and the Gulf of Mottama (Martaban) Coastal Region. The family Hydrocharitaceae represents the most dominant genera of <b>seagrasses</b> in both the Rakhine and the Tanintharyi Coastal Regions. However, the family Cymodoceaceae occurs mainly in the Rakhine Coastal Region, except for Cymodocea rotundata, which is unique to the Tanintharyi Coastal Region. In addition, the phytogeographic distribution and conservation plans of <b>seagrasses</b> of Myanmar have been briefly described...|$|R
5|$|The {{queen conch}} is herbivorous {{and lives in}} <b>seagrass</b> beds, {{although}} its exact habitat varies by development stage. The adult animal has a very large, solid and heavy shell, with knob-like spines on the shoulder, a flared thick, outer lip and a characteristic pink-coloured aperture (opening). The flared lip is absent in younger specimens. The external anatomy of the soft parts of L.gigas {{is similar to that}} of other snails in its family; it has a long snout, two eyestalks with well-developed eyes, additional sensory tentacles, a strong foot and a corneous, sickle-shaped operculum.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{disasters}} {{and other natural}} occurrences are also sources of mortality. The West Indian manatee and Dugong face risks from hurricanes and cyclones, which are predicted to increase in the future. These storms may also damage <b>seagrass</b> populations. Exposure to brevetoxin from Karenia brevis during a red tide event are also sources of mortality; {{they may be able}} to be exposed to brevetoxin after a red tide has subsided, as it could settle on seagrasses. African manatees can become stranded during the dry season when rivers and lakes become too small or dry up completely.|$|E
5|$|Biscayne National Park protects four {{distinct}} ecosystems: {{the shoreline}} mangrove swamp, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps {{of the mainland}} and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, <b>seagrass</b> beds, sponges, soft corals, and manatees. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus' swallowtail butterflies, smalltooth sawfish, manatees, and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.|$|E

5|$|Occurring {{close to}} shore from the surf zone {{to a depth}} of , the milk shark favors turbid water off sandy beaches and {{occasionally}} enters estuaries. In Shark Bay, Western Australia, juvenile milk sharks inhabit <b>seagrass</b> meadows composed of Amphibolis antarctica and Posidonia australis. Although some sources state this species avoids low salinities, it has been reported several times from fresh water in Cambodia, as far upstream as the Tonlé Sap. Milk sharks may be found anywhere in the water column from the surface to the bottom. Off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, its numbers fluctuate annually with a peak in summer, suggesting some form of seasonal movement.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} (if not the most) {{abundant}} near-shore sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds mainly on small benthic and schooling bony fishes. Occasionally squid, octopus, cuttlefish, crabs, shrimp, and gastropods are also taken.
