5|$|When {{asked by}} emperor Frederick to {{also join the}} Swabian League, the Eidgenossen flatly refused: they <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to join an {{alliance}} designed to further Habsburg interests, and they were wary of this new, relatively closely knit and powerful alliance that had arisen on their northern frontier. Furthermore, they resented the strong aristocratic element in the Swabian League, so different from their own organization, which had grown {{over the last two}} hundred years liberating themselves from precisely such an aristocratic rule.|$|E
5|$|Howe was {{determined}} to support technologically advanced industries, and <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> why Canada should not continue to produce aircraft after the war. His Director-General for Aircraft Production, Ralph Bell, disagreed with him, noting that Canada had no aircraft engine manufacturer, and that {{despite the presence of}} manufacturing plants and skilled workers, there was no guarantee that they could sell their products. Nevertheless, Howe took steps to keep aircraft manufacturers in business, allowing the British Hawker Siddeley Group to take over Victory Aircraft as A.V. Roe Canada (Avro Canada), while Canadair was sold to the US-based Electric Boat Company (later General Dynamics).|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Shackleton's near miss, Captain Scott {{organised}} the Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–13, in which securing the South Pole for the British Empire was an explicitly stated prime objective. As he planned his expedition, Scott <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to believe that his effort would be contested. However, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who had been developing plans for a North Pole expedition, changed his mind when, in September 1909, the North Pole was claimed in quick succession by the Americans Frederick Cook and Robert Peary. Amundsen resolved to go south instead.|$|E

5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> why {{the president should be}} guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} last four decades of PedroII's reign were marked by {{continuous}} internal peace and economic prosperity, he had no desire to see the monarchy survive beyond his lifetime and made no effort to maintain support for the institution. The next in line to the throne was his daughter Isabel, but neither PedroII nor the ruling classes considered a female monarch acceptable. Lacking any viable heir, the Empire's political leaders <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to defend the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the First Brazilian Republic.|$|E
5|$|In November1906 the American Robert Peary {{returned}} from his latest unsuccessful quest for the North Pole, claiming a new Farthest North of 87°6′—a record disputed by later historians. He immediately began raising funds for a further attempt. In July1907 Dr Frederick Cook, a former shipmate of Amundsen's from Belgica, set off northwards on what was ostensibly a hunting trip but was rumoured to be an attempt on the North Pole. A month later Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition sailed for Antarctica, while Robert Falcon Scott was preparing a further expedition should Shackleton fail. Amundsen <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to concede priority {{in the south to}} the British, and spoke publicly about the prospects of leading an Antarctic expedition—although his preferred goal remained the North Pole.|$|E

60|$|The matter {{calls for}} the making of no philosophies, craves no explaining, and, above all, needs no apology. It clears itself. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries--more just than our own more enlightened times--attributed no shame {{to the men and}} women born out of wedlock, <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> reason--as <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> is there, Christian or Pagan--why they should suffer for a {{condition}} that was none of their contriving.|$|R
50|$|Saint Peter Festival {{was most}} popular before the 1892 {{shipwreck}}. The shipwreck {{had a significant}} impact in the community {{and the use of the}} Branqueta traditional garments was also affected, as the Branqueta was associated with festivities. The community <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reasons</b> for further celebrations. Before 1962, Saint Peter Festival was a minor festival, major midsummer celebrations occurred during St. John's day. The local municipal holiday was celebrated on August 15, the Feast of the Assumption, the patron saint of Povoan Fishermen, but the local holiday became a national one.|$|R
5|$|Most Spanish Americans <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to {{recognize}} a rump government that was under the threat of being captured by the French at any moment, and began {{to work for the}} creation of local juntas to preserve the region's independence from the French. Junta movements were successful in New Granada (Colombia), Venezuela, Chile and Río de la Plata (Argentina). Less successful, though serious movements, also occurred in Central America. Ultimately, Central America, along with most of New Spain, Quito (Ecuador), Peru, Upper Peru (Bolivia), the Caribbean and the Philippine Islands remained in control of royalists for the next decade and participated in the Spanish Cortes effort to establish a liberal government for the Spanish Monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The Conservative Party had {{previously}} experienced serious division during the 1850s, when the Emperor's complete {{support for the}} Conciliation policy {{gave rise to the}} Progressives. The difference then was that ultraconservatives who opposed Conciliation (led by Eusébio, Uruguai and Itaboraí) perceived the Emperor as being indispensable to the functioning of the political system: an ultimate and impartial arbiter when deadlock threatened. This new generation of ultraconservatives, unlike their predecessors, had no experience of the Regency and early years of PedroII's reign, when external and internal dangers threatened the nation's existence. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity. The young politicians <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to uphold and defend the Imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. Unbeknownst to Rio Branco and PedroII, both had prepared the path to the Empire's later downfall.|$|E
5|$|A {{bigger problem}} was the {{resistance}} of the Shipbuilding Commissariat which said {{it would be impossible to}} lay down any ships of new design until about 1950 and that only incremental changes could be made to the designs currently in production. The Navy <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> why new ships, reflecting wartime experience, could not be laid down beginning in 1948. To resolve the dispute a special commission was appointed, led by Lavrentiy Beria, which mostly sided with the Shipbuilding Commissariat in that most ships of the program would be improved versions of current designs. Four of the large cruisers were to begin construction, two each at Shipyard 402 in Molotovsk and Shipyard 444 at Nikolayev with another three planned to be laid down in 1953 and 1955. This compromise was approved on 27 November 1945 and detailed design work began in 1946 for designs equipped with both the 220mm and 305mm guns.|$|E

5000|$|Ludwig von Mises' {{insistence on}} methodological dualism was a {{reaction}} against “the ‘methodological monism’ preached by behaviorists and positivists who <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> basic <b>reason</b> to approach human behavior and social phenomena differently from the way natural scientists approach molecular behavior and physical phenomena.” ...|$|R
50|$|In May 2000, {{more than}} 22 years after {{resolution}} 425 was passed, Israel withdrew its troops from southern Lebanon. Prior to the withdrawal, opposition voices inside Israel pressured {{the government to}} withdraw from Lebanon, as they <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> valid <b>reason</b> to stay there and sustain Lebanese attacks.|$|R
5|$|Bohemond never {{returned}} to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the carefully constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. In his mind, Antioch was his by right of conquest. He <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to hand it over to someone {{who had not been}} involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed their beliefs. The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did not allow a Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.|$|E
5|$|The last {{modification}} of the class undertaken by Maunsell was the gradual introduction of small smoke deflector plates from 1934. These were fitted to improve driver visibility {{as a result of}} smoke deflection experiments made on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927. Maunsell retired from the Southern Railway in 1937 and his replacement was Oliver Bulleid. Despite making various modifications to the steam circuit on other Maunsell classes, Bulleid <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to make such drastic alterations to the N1class. As a result, the final set of modifications made under Southern Railway ownership was made after the Second World War and included the removal of superfluous smokebox-mounted anti-vacuum snifting valves and the replacement of the wide-diameter N1 chimney with the U1 type to improve draughting on the prototype; the standard Nclass chimneys of the other five were also replaced. The class was well-used by British Railways over both Central and Eastern sections between 1948 and 1962 and justified the fitting of Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1959 alongside the Nclass.|$|E
5|$|After their {{experience}} of the perils and obstacles of government, the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s saw the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential for governing and for national survival. These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until, by the 1880s, they had almost entirely {{been replaced by a}} newer generation of politicians who had no experience of the early years of PedroII's reign. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity and <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to uphold and defend the imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. To them PedroII was merely an old and increasingly sick man who had steadily eroded his position by taking an active role in politics for decades. Before he had been above criticism, but now his every action and inaction prompted meticulous scrutiny and open criticism. Many young politicians had become apathetic toward the monarchic regime and, when the time came, they would do nothing to defend it. PedroII's achievements went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites. By his very success, the Emperor had made his position seem unnecessary.|$|E
6000|$|June laughed, for in {{her eyes}} {{artifice}} in war was oftener a merit than a crime; {{but she was too}} true to her tribe herself to say more than the occasion required.

6000|$|Rowland {{felt that}} his {{irritation}} had not subsided, and {{he himself had}} no taste for saying disagreeable things. Nevertheless he <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> sufficient <b>reason</b> to forbear uttering the words he had had on his conscience from the beginning.

60|$|As the topman <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> {{sufficient}} <b>reason</b> for concealing his astonishment at {{this wild}} opinion, it was manifested {{with all the}} embellishments with which the individual in question usually set forth any of his more visible emotions. After casting a short glance {{in the direction of}} the sail, in order to assure himself there had been no deception, he turned his eyes in great disgust on Scipio, as if he would vindicate the credit of the association at the expense of some little contempt for the ignorance of his companion.|$|R

25|$|In public comments, Selig said he <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> {{to reconsider}} Rose's punishment; however, in March 2003, Selig {{acknowledged}} that he was considering Rose's application, leading to speculation that Rose's return might be imminent. Ultimately, however, Selig took no action.|$|E
60|$|Eveline readily acquiesced in {{what was}} proposed, as the {{expedient}} agreeable to the Constable, and recommended by Damian; but, in the simplicity of her heart, she <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> good <b>reason</b> why, under the guardianship of the latter, she should not instantly, and without farther form, have traversed the little familiar plain on which, when a child, she used to chase butterflies and gather king's- cups, and where of later years she was wont to exercise her palfrey on this well-known plain, being the only space, and that of small extent, which separated her from the camp of the Constable.|$|R
5000|$|The {{efforts to}} control Afghanistan were further {{weakened}} by the British government in India. Dismayed at the costs of maintaining the large garrison in Kabul, it discontinued the periodic subsidies (essentially bribes) that had {{been paid to the}} various tribes in the region around Kabul and the Khyber Pass to keep the peace. Once these ended, the tribes <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> more <b>reason</b> to remain loyal to the British-supported regime. Macnaghten dismissed warnings from his officers, writing to his superiors in India that [...] "this is the usual state of Afghan society". As {{the spring and summer of}} 1841 progressed, British freedom of movement around Kabul became increasingly restricted.|$|R
6000|$|The plan of [...] "striking out" [...] {{had been}} in Richard Dare's mind for several months. The country school at Mossvale had closed for the season early in the spring--so as to allow the farmer boys to do their work, and Richard was {{satisfied}} that he had about learned all that Mr. Parsons, the pedagogue, was able or willing to teach, and <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> good <b>reason</b> for his returning in the fall. He {{would have liked to}} continue his studies, but there was only one other institute of learning in the neighborhood--a boarding academy, where the rates for tuition were high, and to this he well knew his parents could not afford to send him.|$|R
25|$|Maternal feminists {{did not see}} maternalism {{as being}} limited to {{biological}} maternity. They extended it to social or spiritual motherhood, and <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> why a woman should not remain single and devote herself to a professional career or to social causes.|$|E
25|$|Discussion and {{adoption}} of Tongyong Pinyin, {{like many other}} initiatives in Taiwan, quickly acquired a partisan tone turning on issues of national identity: Chinese vs. Taiwanese identity. Officials who identified most strongly with the nation itself, such as the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its allied parties, <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to adopt Hanyu Pinyin just because Mainland China and the UN had. If Tongyong Pinyin more adequately met the nation's needs, they saw this as ample justification for Taiwan to adopt it. Officials who identified more strongly with Chinese culture, such as the Kuomintang (KMT), <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to introduce a new system unique to Taiwan if Hanyu Pinyin had already gained international acceptance. Each side accused the other of basing its preference on anti-China or pro-China sentiment rather than an objective discussion of community goals.|$|E
25|$|He {{believed}} any {{offer at}} that stage of Sainsbury's recovery was likely to undervalue the business, and with private equity seeking high returns on their investments, <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to sell, given that the current management, led by Justin King, could deliver the extra profit generated {{for the benefit of}} existing investors.|$|E
60|$|Thus, {{the penalty}} exacted had proved a picnic and a feast--all of which {{appealed to the}} thrifty, calculating brain of Bashti. And what was good for Ano Ano, in his {{judgment}} was surely good for Somo. Since such were white men's ways who sailed under the British flag and killed pigs and cut down coconuts in cancellation of blood-debts and headtakings, Bashti <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> valid <b>reason</b> why he should not profit as Ano Ano had profited. The {{price to be paid}} at some possible future time was absurdly disproportionate to the immediate wealth to be gained. Besides, it had been over two years since the last British war vessel had appeared in the Solomons.|$|R
60|$|The sudden {{appearance}} of the city constable, a functionary whose person was not unknown {{to most of the}} company, brought every man at table to his feet, the Rev. Mr. Worden, Dirck and myself, included. For my own part, I <b>saw</b> <b>no</b> particular <b>reason</b> for alarm, though it at once struck me that this visit might have some connection with the demolished supper, since the law does not, in all cases, suffer a man to reclaim even his own, by trick or violence. As for the constable himself, a short, compact, snub-nosed, Dutch-built person, who spoke English as if it disagreed with his bile, he was the coolest of the whole party.|$|R
50|$|Marshall then {{addressed}} the Commerce Clause issues, {{and the argument}} of the Solicitor General that {{the section of the}} Commerce Clause that dealt directly with Indians applied rather than the argument of the oil companies that the section dealing with interstate commerce applied. First, Marshall noted that the case history of the Indian Commerce Clause was to protect the tribes from state infringement, not to approve of Indian trade without constitutional restraint. He <b>saw</b> of <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> to begin now, especially since he did not find that the tribe's severance tax did not have negative implications on interstate commerce. In a 6-3 decision, Marshall found that the tribe had the right to impose such a tax on non-Indians.|$|R
