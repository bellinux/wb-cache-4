5|$|Bismuth is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBi and atomic number 83. Bismuth, a pentavalent post-transition metal {{and one of}} the pnictogens, chemically resembles its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but <b>surface</b> <b>oxidation</b> can give it a pink tinge. Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element, and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals.|$|E

This oxide layer protects the material up to 1370°C. Above this temperature bulk oxidation occurs. Aluminium nitride is stable in hydrogen and carbon dioxide atmospheres up to 980°C.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the bone interface response to different surface using bone remodeling rate (BRR) under cyclic loading. The tibiae of 10 New Zealand white rabbits were used. Each tibia of rabbits received 2 implants, one with anodic <b>oxidation</b> <b>surface</b> and the other with machined surface. Dynamic loading, a cyclic load of 100 N with 100 cycles was applied for 2 weeks. All implants were divided into 4 groups according to surface treatment and loading; (1) machined surface, unloaded, (2) anodic <b>oxidation</b> <b>surface,</b> unloaded, (3) machined surface, loaded, and (4) anodic <b>oxidation</b> <b>surface,</b> loaded. To determine the rate of bone formation, a series of fluorochrome bone labeling materials (tetracycline, alizarin red, and calcein green) were administrated intramuscularly at 10, 11, 12 weeks. To study the formation time of new bone, ground sections were examined under confocal laser scanning microscopy. Resonance frequency analysis (RFA) values were measured at the time of first surgery, second surgery and sacrifice. From this study, it was concluded that implants with anodic <b>oxidation</b> <b>surface</b> had higher value than machined surface on RFA measurement and anodic <b>oxidation</b> <b>surface</b> has more resistance to loading than machined surface...|$|R

25|$|Matte solder {{is usually}} fused {{to provide a}} better bonding surface for bare copper. Treatments, such as benzimidazolethiol, prevent <b>surface</b> <b>oxidation</b> of bare copper. The places to which {{components}} will be mounted are typically plated, because untreated bare copper oxidizes quickly, and therefore is not readily solderable. Traditionally, any exposed copper was coated with solder by hot air solder levelling (HASL). The HASL finish prevents oxidation from the underlying copper, thereby guaranteeing a solderable surface. This solder was a tin-lead alloy, however new solder compounds are now used to achieve compliance with the RoHS directive in the EU, which restricts the use of lead. One of these lead-free compounds is SN100CL, made up of 99.3% tin, 0.7% copper, 0.05% nickel, and a nominal of 60ppm germanium.|$|E
60|$|When we {{pass from}} the agency termed igneous, to aqueous and {{atmospheric}} agencies, we see the like ever-growing complications of effects. The denuding actions of air and water, joined with those of changing temperature, have, from the beginning, been modifying every exposed <b>surface.</b> <b>Oxidation,</b> heat, wind, frost, rain, glaciers, rivers, tides, waves, have been unceasingly producing disintegration; varying in kind and amount according to local circumstances. Acting upon a tract of granite, they here work scarcely an appreciable effect; there cause exfoliations of the surface, and a resulting heap of débris and boulders; and elsewhere, after decomposing the feldspar into a white clay, carry away this and the accompanying quartz and mica, and deposit them in separate beds, fluviatile and marine. When the exposed land consists of several unlike kinds of sedimentary strata, or igneous rocks, or both, denudation produces changes proportionably more heterogeneous. The formations being disintegrable in different degrees, there follows an increased irregularity of surface. The areas drained by different rivers being differently constituted, these rivers carry down to the sea different combinations of ingredients; and so sundry new strata of unlike compositions are formed. And here we may see very simply illustrated, the truth, which we shall presently have to trace out in more involved cases, that {{in proportion to the}} heterogeneity of the object or objects on which any force expends itself, is the heterogeneity of the effects. A continent of complex structure, exposing many strata irregularly distributed, raised to various levels, tilted up at all angles, will, under the same denuding agencies, give origin to innumerable and involved results: each district must be differently modified; each river must carry down a different kind of detritus; each deposit must be differently distributed by the entangled currents, tidal and other, which wash the contorted shores; and this multiplication of results must manifestly be greatest where the complexity of surface is greatest.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{recent years}} {{scanning}} tunneling microscopy (STM) (Binnig et al. 1982, Binnig et al. 1987) has developed {{into one of the}} subtlest tools in the research of surface phenomena.

The types of parameters involved in designing the experiments include the type of furnace, the type of atmosphere, and in general which materials are better behaved than others as determined by past experience in the facility. One of the major advantages of the facility lies {{in its ability to}} provide large undercoolings in the cooling curve during the drops. A beginning was to consider the effect of oxygen and other gases upon the amount of undercooling observed.

50|$|Graping {{occurrence}} {{has continued}} to increase since it was first identified in 2006. The viscosity of the flux decreases as {{the temperature of the}} reflow oven increases. Lead-free reflow soldering temperatures are higher which results in more graping. Graping is also caused by increased <b>surface</b> <b>oxidation.</b> The increased <b>surface</b> <b>oxidation</b> is the result of smaller printed paste deposit volumes that cause a diminished surface area to flux ratio of the solder particle resulting in flux exhaustion. While solder paste can be manufactured using any size range however there has been a move towards finer particle sizes especially for fine feature stencil printing. Finer particle sizes places added pressure on the solder paste flux to remove surface oxides which leaves the outside of the joint not fully coalesced producing the irregular surface finish known as graping.|$|E

40|$|Hot <b>surface</b> <b>oxidations</b> are {{commonly}} thought to involve initial free radical hydrogen atom abstraction. Our evidence implicates initial Lewis base deprotonation by O•- atomic oxygen radical anions to form negatively charged carbanions. Subsequent rate determining electron transfers generate free radicals which only then {{give rise to}} combustion. Correlations regarding ignition temperatures and hydrocarbon oxidation product identity are consistent with carbanionic but not free radical effects. Highly polarized surfaces (e. g., quartz and corroded surfaces), and addition of polar compounds to fuel/air mixtures facilitate ignitions. EFM confirms increased electrostatic intensities at microscopic surface defects. For seemingly uniformly hot surfaces there are transient widely disparate high temperature incandescent “red spot ” zones due to flameless oxidations induced by concentrated electrostatic negative charges at surface defects. Isotope, ignition temperatures and combustion trends are consistent with Seebeck effects (ease of electron migration in unevenly heated areas). There are preliminary though not yet verified indications that electrostatic charges on hot surfaces may facilitate combustion. Implications would then involve fire mitigation and enhancement, and industria...|$|R
