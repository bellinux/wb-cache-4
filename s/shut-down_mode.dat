The system consists primarily of a klystron tube, transmitter, and High-Voltage Power Supply (HVPS). The 703. 75 MHz klystron made by CPl, Inc. provides RF power of 1 MW CW with efficiency of 65 %. It has a single output window, diode-type electron gun, and collector capable of dissipating the entire beam power. It was fully factory tested including 24 -hour heat run at 1. 1 MW CWo The solid state HVPS designed by Continental Electronics provides up to 100 kV at low ripple and 2. 1 MW CW with over 95 % efficiency.

40|$|Many {{embedded}} {{control systems}} work in different operating modes, for example start-up, stand-by, <b>shut-down</b> and failure <b>mode.</b> These different operating modes usually have different timing requirements, {{and the different}} functional behaviour also leads to differences in timing behaviour. A Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis of such a system needs to determine mode-specific bounds on execution times, because a single overall bound may be too pessimistic. Mode determination and mode-specific analysis also form a prerequisite for analysing system behaviour during mode transitions, a most critical phase of a system. The operating modes of embedded control systems are often not precisely represented, neither in hand-written code nor in code synthesised by model-based design tools nor on the model level.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in using wind turbines oshore, and in deeper water. The tension leg platform wind turbine (TLPWT) concept is promising for intermediate (45 - 150 m) or deep (> 150 m) water. The limited platform motions are expected to reduce the structural loading on the tower and blades compared to other floating concepts, without requiring the large draft of a spar or the spread mooring system and complex construction of a semi-submersible. Although numerous TLPWT designs exist on paper, {{there is very little}} consensus regarding size, tendon design, and analysis requirements. In order {{to determine whether or not}} such concepts could be feasible and to lead the way for future optimization work, a better understanding of how design choices aect the global system performance, an investigation of potential design-driving load cases, and an evaluation of the simulation sensitivity are required. TLPWT systems are complex and dynamic: time-varying environmental loads from the sea, soil, and air act on a exible integrated structure with a wide range of natural frequencies. Furthermore, the wind turbine may enter and exit various operational, start-up, <b>shut-down,</b> and failure <b>modes.</b> Dynamic simulation of TLPWTs requires multidisciplinary consideration of aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, control systems, and structural mechanics. Frequency-domain methods from oshore structures are not well-suited to the exible structure and wind forces, while the computationally intense simulations common to the wind turbine industry are impractical with respect to the long time series required to capture wave- and low-frequency dynamics. A new computational tool (SIMO-RIFLEX-AeroDyn) was developed and used to examine both the design and analysis of TLPWTs. The combination of three well-known codes under a single structural solver gave a stable, state-of-the-art numerical tool for analysis of floating wind turbines. Additionally, the wind turbine control system was implemented in Java, including options for applying a control system fault at an arbitrary point in time. This framework enabled detailed studies of parametric design effects, comparisons of different hydrodynamic models using a single structural model - including the implementation of a different ringing force model - and simulation of off-design conditions. This thesis presents several baseline designs based on a parametric approach. Preliminary coupled simulations using first order wave forces suggested that a reasonable single column design with displacement between 3500 and 6500 m 3, three pontoons (for easier installation), and pontoon radius between 28 and 35 m, may be able to support a 5 MW wind turbine and withstand harsh environmental conditions. Having established these designs as test cases, various analysis methods were compared. Neither linear frequency-domain analysis nor Morison-type forces gave acceptable results. Second-order sum-frequency wave forces were found to be important for fatigue and extreme response calculations for certain TLPWTs, particularly those with relatively soft tendons. Third order ringing forces were found to be critical for TLPWTs with large diameters (14 - 18 m), especially when the turbine was idling or parked. Finally, the analysis tool was extended to several different severe operational conditions. Control system faults were found to cause large tower top loads and yaw motions for TLWPTs, while wind-wave misalignment resulted in generally smaller responses than aligned conditions. Second-order forces, however, had a greater impact in misaligned wind and waves than in aligned conditions. The original contributions of this thesis - including participation in developing the novel analysis tool (and the implementation of ringing loads), the development of a simplifed design method, and the presented simulation results - provide the background for further studies of TLPWTs and other floating wind turbine concepts.

40|$|PhD (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 In this thesis, ammonia (NH 3) {{decomposition}} {{was assessed}} as a fuel processing technology for producing on-demand hydrogen (H 2) for portable and distributed fuel cell applications. This study {{was motivated by}} the present lack of infrastructure to generate H 2 for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. An overview of past and recent worldwide research activities {{in the development of}} reactor technologies for portable and distributed hydrogen generation via NH 3 decomposition was presented in Chapter 2. The objective was to uncover the principal challenges relating to the state-of-the-art in reactor technology and obtain a basis for future improvements. Several important aspects such as reactor design, operability, power generation capacity and efficiency (conversion and energy) were appraised for innovative reactor technologies vis-à-vis microreactors, monolithic reactors, membrane reactors, and electrochemical reactors (electrolyzers). It was observed that substantial research effort is required to progress the innovative reactors to commercialization on a wide basis. The use of integrated experimental-mathematical modelling approach (useful in attaining accurately optimized designs) was notably non-existent for all reactors throughout the surveyed openliterature. Microchannel reactors were however identified as a transformative reactor technology for producing on-demand H 2 for PEM cell applications. Against this background, miniaturized H 2 production in a stand-alone ammonia-fuelled microchannel reactor (reformer) washcoated with a commercial Ni-Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst (ActiSorb® O 6) was demonstrated successfully in Chapter 3. The reformer performance was evaluated by investigating the effect of reaction temperature (450 – 700 °C) and gas-hourly-space-velocity (6 520 – 32 600 Nml gcat - 1 h- 1) on key performance parameters including NH 3 conversion, residual NH 3 concentration, H 2 production rate, and pressure drop. Particular attention was devoted to defining operating conditions that minimised residual NH 3 in reformate gas, while producing H 2 at a satisfactory rate. The reformer operated in a daily start-up and <b>shut-down</b> (DSS) -like <b>mode</b> for a total 750 h comprising of 125 cycles, all to mimic frequent intermittent operation envisaged for fuel cell systems. The reformer exhibited remarkable operation demonstrating 98. 7 % NH 3 conversion at 32 600 Nml gcat - 1 h- 1 and 700 °C to generate an estimated fuel cell power output of 5. 7 We and power density of 16 kWe L- 1 (based on effective reactor volume). At the same time, reformer operation yielded low pressure drop (< 10 Pa mm- 1) for all conditions considered. Overall, the microchannel reformer performed sufficiently exceptional to warrant serious consideration in supplying H 2 to low-power fuel cell systems. In Chapter 4, hydrogen production from the Ni-Pt-washcoated ammonia-fuelled microchannel reactor was mathematically simulated in a three-dimensional (3 D) CFD model implemented via Comsol Multiphysics™. The objective was to obtain an understanding of reaction-coupled transport phenomena as well as a fundamental explanation of the observed microchannel reactor performance. The transport processes and reactor performance were elucidated in terms of velocity, temperature, and species concentration distributions, as well as local reaction rate and NH 3 conversion profiles. The baseline case was first investigated to comprehend the behavior of the microchannel reactor, then microstructural design and operating parameters were methodically altered around the baseline conditions to explore the optimum values (case-study optimization). The modelling results revealed that an optimum NH 3 space velocity (GHSV) of 65. 2 Nl gcat - 1 h- 1 yields 99. 1 % NH 3 conversion and a power density of 32 kWe L- 1 at the highest operating temperature of 973 K. It was also shown that a 40 -μm-thick porous washcoat was most desirable at these conditions. Finally, a low channel hydraulic diameter (225 μm) was observed to contribute to high NH 3 conversion. Most importantly, mass transport limitations in the porouswashcoat and gas-phase were found to be negligible as depicted by the Damköhler and Fourier numbers, respectively. The experimental microchannel reactor produced 98. 2 % NH 3 conversion and a power density of 30. 8 kWe L- 1 when tested at the optimum operating conditions established by the model. Good agreement with experimental data was observed, so the integrated experimental-modeling approach used here may well provide an incisive step toward the efficient design of ammonia-fuelled microchannel reformers. In Chapter 5, the prospect of producing H 2 via ammonia (NH 3) decomposition was evaluated in an experimental stand-alone microchannel reactor wash-coated with a commercial Cs-promoted Ru/Al 2 O 3 catalyst (ACTA Hypermec 10010). The reactor performance was investigated under atmospheric pressure as a function of reaction temperature (723 – 873 K) and gas-hourly-space-velocity (65. 2 – 326. 1 Nl gcat - 1 h- 1). Ammonia conversion of 99. 8 % was demonstrated at 326. 1 Nl gcat - 1 h- 1 and 873 K. The H 2 produced at this operating condition was sufficient to yield an estimated fuel cell power output of 60 We and power density of 164 kWe L- 1. Overall, the Ru-based microchannel reactor outperformed other NH 3 microstructured reformers reported in literature including the Ni-based system used in Chapter 3. Furthermore, the microchannel reactor showed a superior performance against a fixed-bed tubular microreactor with the same Ru-based catalyst. Overall, the high H 2 throughput exhibited may promote widespread use of the Ru-based micro-reaction system in high-power applications. Four peer-reviewed journal publications and six conference publications resulted from this work. Doctora...|$|R
