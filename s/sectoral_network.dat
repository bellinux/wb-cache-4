30|$|The general {{consensus}} in macroeconomics {{has been that}} sector-specific shocks should average out over the entire economy based on Lucas’s “diversification argument” (Lucas 1977). However, this view has recently been challenged from the network perspective by several authors (Shea 2002; Acemoglu et al. 2012; Acemoglu et al. 2011; Carvalho 2007) suggesting that {{in the presence of}} certain <b>sectoral</b> <b>network</b> structures, this argument may not apply. In particular, (Acemoglu et al. 2012) has shown that the rate of decay in aggregate fluctuations depends on the network structure governing interdependency among sectors. Our model is closely related to (Acemoglu et al. 2012), but much closer to (Shea 2002) in that we model effects from both upstream and downstream linkages. Our work is also related in spirit to (Foerster et al. 2011; Malysheva and Sarte 2011) in providing a systematic econometric analysis of the propagation of shocks and the relationship to aggregate fluctuations. The difference is that while (Foerster et al. 2011; Malysheva and Sarte 2011) focus on sectorial linkages, we focus more on micro connections in interfirm networks.|$|E
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of EU agencies 1 {{is one of}} the most important institutional developments at the EU level. 2 Because they are considered to be an effective tool in implementing EU policies, 3 the scope of delegation to agencies has grown not only in quantitative terms, but also qualitatively, implying the growth of agencies’ powers. 4 Next to their information-gathering, cooperation, service and advice-providing tasks, EU agencies have been given regulatory powers as well. Overall, there are two main types of rulemaking through which ‘EU agencies seem to provide a substantial regulatory contribution to the smooth functioning of their policy sectors. ’ 5 First, agencies may participate, as technical actors, in procedures leading to the adoption of binding implementing rules, either assisting the European Commission or directly adopting technical rules. Second, they are often formally or de facto granted the power to issue soft law instruments, either to the regulatees or to other administrations participating in the <b>sectoral</b> <b>network</b> they coordinate. 6 What sets these ‘regulatory’ agencies apart within the broader agency population is that these powers, ‘although not binding, are anything but negligible and represent a culmination of agency contribution to rule-making. ’ 7 Especially the delegation of more and more soft regulatory powers to EU agencies occurs in a growing number of policy areas, e. g. in the field of aviation, medicines and financial services, in order to increase the effectiveness of EU action. 8 Indeed, the flexibility of soft law instruments allows for easy anticipation on the dynamics of societal and technological developments. Although the growing scope of the delegation of public authority to agencies is said to be necessary to enhance the effectiveness of EU policies, it raises doubts concerning the legitimacy of agencies and their decisions at the same time...|$|E

This paper builds on this research by assessing the impact of dense <b>sectoral</b> policy <b>networks</b> on the political dynamics of economy-wide, as opposed to sectoral business mobilisation. In the case of the recent politics of tax reform in Japan it would appear that concentrated <b>sectoral</b> policy <b>networks</b> may actually compromise the state’s reformative capacity.

This article contributes to a growing body of literature on those networks and their effect on executive politics at the national level by asking whether and how the EU involvement of national agencies affects the agencies' autonomy in policy formulation. We develop an analytical model for explaining the effect of EU involvement on agency autonomy. Analyzing data from a comprehensive survey of federal agencies in Germany, we find that EU involvement has a positive effect on national agencies' policy autonomy. Moreover, we find a somewhat stronger effect of agency involvement in <b>sectoral</b> <b>networks</b> on autonomy than in intergovernmental networks, which is attributed to information asymmetries between ministries and agencies. Yet this effect is weaker than initially expected, which can be explained by a considerable degree of overlap between different types of EU involvement...|$|R

30|$|Regarding {{the size}} of {{scientific}} collaborations, we find results similar to the R&D alliances. I.e., most papers in our APS-MSAS data set have two co-authors with a broad right-skewed size distribution for all PACS numbers investigated. From our analysis, we have excluded all papers written by only one author because {{we are interested in}} collaboration networks, whereas such papers would only generate isolated nodes. 4 Also, in every economic data set on inter-firm alliances, a collaboration of size 1 could not exist by definition. Hence, to the purpose of comparing R&D and co-authorship networks, we do not consider single-author papers and {{the size of}} the collaboration events starts from 2 in all of our plots. Figure  3 gives representative examples from two PACS numbers. Differently from the <b>sectoral</b> R&D <b>networks,</b> the co-authorship networks exhibit a larger degree of variability among PACS numbers. This is due to the fact that the typical number of authors per paper strongly depends on the field. To give an example, the field of applied and interdisciplinary physics is characterized by significantly fewer authors per paper (at most 10) than the field of general relativity and gravitation (whose right tail reaches 55 authors per paper). In Figure  11 and Figure  12 in Appendix  1, we show the distribution of collaboration sizes for respectively the six <b>sectoral</b> R&D <b>networks</b> and the six co-authorship networks.|$|R
30|$|Comparing the {{two types}} of factors, we find that network-endogenous factors are {{predominant}} in the formation of new collaborations in each of the collaboration networks analyzed in this study.

This result is also in line with the empirical finding [37, 38] that firms in R&D networks prefer to establish alliances with other firms which have an history of previous alliances.|$|R

Central to strategies of enabling this must be partnership and networking, both local and global – public and private, with action leading to a solid foundation for innovation. As competition is the ultimate driver of innovation, this calls for more entrepreneurial dynamism and greater mobility of knowledge based on an effective use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to enable increased interconnectivity between knowledge workers through virtual networking. In a Knowledge Society it is humans and human capital, their vision and abilities, which are most important to the positive development of our regions, rather than the predominant physical resources and issues of the past. Empowering our people to apply their intelligence, experience and imagination to leverage data and information into a Knowledge Society, requires dynamic regional leadership, a “can do ” attitude and a holistic approach to regional development. A Regional Innovative Knowledge Society requires alternate nodes of development in various local contexts and new mechanisms such as awareness creation, access to telecommunications, education/training, finance, academic/industrial interactions and <b>sectoral</b> <b>networks.</b> This process is recognised at European level and is already happening at local level, as illustrated in Turkiye’s Southeastern Anatolia Region and elsewhere.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} is a cross-cutting issue par excellence that is thought to require {{a high level of}} policy coordination. This is especially true considering that the European Union (EU) has also accepted that its internal policies must support the sustainable development of other countries, particularly developing countries. The EU is increasingly employing new modes of governance to achieve this, in particular network-based policy coordination mechanisms. However, despite a raft of literature on policy networks in the EU, the majority of the empirical work has focused only on <b>sectoral</b> <b>networks.</b> This has led to an ambiguity surrounding the use of networks in governing cross-cutting policy areas, which this thesis attempts to address. Specifically, the assumption that networks are always self-steering is tested. Elite interviews and documentary analysis are used to complete three tasks. First, the general patterns of coordination of the external dimension ofEU sustainable development in three network-based policy coordination mechanisms are examined, namely the Cardiff process, Impact Assessment and Thematic Strategies. Next, three in-depth case studies are presented, namely mercury, sugar and tobacco policy. Then, the observed pattern and level ofcoordination is discussed using an analytical framework which distinguishes two types ofpolicy networks: intra-sector and inter-sector. This thesis arrives at four main findings. First, it confirms that the external dimension has. often been neglected in the EU's implementation of sustainable development. Second, the presence of networks does not necessarily lead to effective coordination. Sector networks can actually inhibit horizontal coordination where as inter-sector networks are needed for the coordination of cross-cutting policy issues. Third, contrary to the assumptions of some authors, inter-sector networks are not always self-steering. Finally, network-based coordination mechanisms are not a sufficient condition for networks to form. It is necessary for effective networks to already be in place if these mechanisms are to function effectively. Consequently, this thesis concludes that, if the EU is to continue to use networks in its approach to governing, it must be prepared to engage in a greater amount of hands-on management of these networks.

40|$|The network industries, {{which had}} been {{organized}} in a monopolistic fashion up to Austria's EU accession, were opened to competition following a number of EU Directives and are now mostly regulated by sectorspecific authorities. This fundamental change to the regulatory system has so far developed quite positively, both in economic terms and from a regulatory perspective regarding the transparency of these authorities' decision-making processes. Accession to the EU served as an essential catalyst for reforming the relevant regulations, which had come to meet their original purpose of correcting market failures only in part. Thus, Austria's EU entry extended the principle of competition from the already exposed manufacturing sector to other sectors of the Austrian economy. However, chances are that the network industries would have been opened to competition even without Austria joining the EU, e. g. on account of its WTO membership or the discrimination against other sectors which would eventually have demanded such reforms. <b>Sectoral</b> regulation, <b>Network</b> Industries, Austria, EU Accession...|$|R

See: [URL] An integrated approach to the mental healthcare of older people is advocated across health, aged care and social care sectors. It is not clear, however, how the management of integrated servicing should occur, although interorganisational relations theory suggests a reflective network approach using evaluation feedback. This research will test a network management approach to help regional primary healthcare organisations improve mental health service integration. Methods and analysis: This mixed methods case study in rural South Australia will test facilitated reflection within a network of health and social care services to determine if this leads to improved integration. Engagement of services will occur through a governance group and a series of three 1 -day service stakeholder workshops. Facilitated reflection and evaluation feedback will use information from a review of health sector and local operational policies, a network survey about current service links, gaps and enablers and interviews with older people and their carers about their help seeking journeys. Quantitative and qualitative analysis will describe the policy enablers and explore the current and ideal links between services. The facilitated reflection will be developed to maximise engagement of senior management in the governance group and the service staff at the operational level in the workshops. Benefit will be assessed through indicators of improved service coordination, collective ownership of service problems, strengthened partnerships, agreed local protocols and the use of feedback for accountability. Ethics, benefits and dissemination: Ethics approval will deal with the sensitivities of organisational network research where data anonymity is not preserved. The benefit will be the tested utility of a facilitated reflective process for a network of health and social care services to manage linked primary mental healthcare for older people in a rural region.

Second, we reflect the role of innovation ambition in shaping firms’ knowledge search strategies. Third, we differentiate between firms’ interactive and non-interactive knowledge search activities and recognise that these may be complemented by unanticipated and serendipitous knowledge spillovers. Finally, we employ the notion of encoding capacity to reflect firms’ internal ability to assimilate and apply external knowledge, and clarify its distinctiveness from the more general concept of absorptive capacity.

Therefore, in the paper we will first introduce Wallace’s model for theory development. Secondly, we will apply this model and evaluate the literature according to the question what has been achieved so far.

The article argues that {{the evolution of the}} Australian tax policy network over the study period was prompted by both associational and state actors reassessing their strategies {{in the context of the}} political failure of tax reform proposals.

40|$|This PhD {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} deepen the current {{understanding of the}} European Union’s (EU) transgovernmental (TG) cooperation with its Eastern neighbours under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Scholars of Europeanization and EU external governance have already pointed out the potential of EU TG cooperation to advance EU democracy promotion goals and regulatory standards to the ENP countries under the absence of EU membership perspective. The major instrument of such cooperation is Twinning, which fosters peer-to-peer, cross-border networks between civil servants and experts from EU member states (MS) and their ENP counterparts. Nevertheless, the existing literature overlooks several important aspects of EU TG cooperation, which pertain to the democratic substance, the role of MS, {{and the effectiveness of}} Twinning projects under the ENP. By drawing on interdisciplinary scholarship from EU studies and public administration, this dissertation addresses those gaps in four thematic articles. The first article provides the context for this study by presenting TG cooperation as a promising but little studied instrument, which may help the EU advance its democracy promotion agenda under the ENP. The second article introduces the concept of democratic governance substance and explores the presence and variation of democratic governance norms in Twinning projects in the Eastern neighbourhood. The third article discusses the added value that Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) and the older MS bring for Twinning cooperation in Azerbaijan and Ukraine. The fourth and last article explores to what extent Twinning projects in Ukraine have been effective and what conditions explain their (in) effectiveness. The overall geographical focus of this work are the countries of the EU’s Eastern neighbourhood, which are covered by the ENP framework. In such a way, this dissertation proposes a new concept of democratic governance substance, conceptualises the comparative advantages of EU MS for Twinning cooperation, and suggests an original way of understanding the effectiveness of Twinning projects. In contrast to the predominantly qualitative studies of EU TG cooperation under the ENP, it also seeks to make a methodological contribution by embracing mixed-method approaches to data analysis. Finally, it provides policy-relevant recommendations regarding Twinning implementation in the future. In doing so, it relies on an original analysis of 45 semi-structured interviews, conducted with Twinning participants and experts from the Eastern neighbourhood countries, EU member states, and the European Commission between November 2014 and May 2016. Additionally, it uses a wealth of supplementary data from official Twinning documents, sectoral watchdogs, international organizations, government sources in the EU and the Eastern neighbourhood, and existing policy research. The findings reveal that, through its Twinning projects in the Eastern neighbourhood, the EU promotes democratic governance substance, which varies by configuration and magnitude across policy sectors and countries. This variation is best explained by domestic variables, such as the country’s political liberalisation, sector politicization, and sector technical complexity. In addition, the dissertation demonstrates that, during Twinning cooperation, CEECs manifest mostly country-specific comparative advantages, such as their recent transition and accession experience, socio-linguistic proximity, and shared historical legacies with the Eastern neighbourhood countries. In contrast, the older MS typically offer sector-specific comparative advantages, owing to their institutional experience, sectoral fit, existing <b>sectoral</b> <b>networks</b> with the Eastern neighbourhood countries, and prior Twinning participation. Both types of comparative advantages are found to be complementary. Finally, a configurational analysis of the effectiveness of Twinning projects in Ukraine indicates that a policy fit is the only necessary condition behind the legal and institutional convergence of the country with the EU’s policy recommendations. Thereby, institutional convergence occurs in parallel to or exceeds legal convergence in effective Twinning projects. This undermines the mainstream scholarly expectations of the wide gap between EU norm adoption and implementation (application) in EU TG cooperation under the ENP...|$|R

We find that sector-based organizing (1) facilitates the development of worker- and sector-targeted service strategies, thereby enabling low-wage worker groups and organizations to better achieve their service and policy goals; (2) maximizes opportunities for the organizations to obtain national resources; and (3) expands the reach of organizational networks by bringing organizations together to share resources and best practices.

40|$|This PhD-thesis {{describes}} the co-evolution of <b>sectoral</b> characteristics, <b>networks</b> of firms and the embedded learning regime {{from the perspective}} of a sectoral innovation system (SIS). More specifically, this research aims to shed light on how the institutional environment of a SIS conditions network structures and learning regimes and how outcomes from a learning regime may affect again the institutional environment of a SIS. Moreover, this research aims to understand in how far this co-evolutionary process differs between different SIS’s. In analysing this co-evolutionary process, two views on organisation are combined, namely a competence view and a governance view. Following this, a dynamic model of co-evolution at the level of a SIS is developed based on which a number of hypotheses is developed. To test these hypotheses, two SIS’s in the Netherlands have been studied over the period from the late 1980 ’s towards the early years of the new millennium : multimedia and pharmaceutical biotechnology. The empirical findings indicate that a general pattern of co-evolution on a sectoral level can be identified. How this pattern settles in network characteristics, coordination mechanisms and in properties of a learning regime is specific to the institutional set-up within a SIS or within different parts of a SIS. In this respect, this study contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of SIS’s as well as of how the optimality of network structure and coordination mechanisms varies with different types of SIS’sVictor Gilsing was born in Amstelveen at 18 th September 1969.

While services are provided mostly by nonprofit agencies, the system is monitored and funded by for-profit managed care. In this situation, nonprofit organizations are entrenched in the professional norms of client-centered cooperation, which may {{run counter to the}} funding mechanism in for-profit managed care. This dissertation examined the relationship between organizational embeddedness and organizational social performance (indicated by trust, reputation, and influence) in this a centrally governed network. Data were collected on 35 network service providers in 2000. A comprehensive network survey and field interviews were employed to collect data. Standard network analysis and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression were used for data analysis. This dissertation sought {{to determine the extent to}} which the social performance implications of organizational embeddedness can be generalized from decentralized networks to a managed multi-sector network. Based on a literature review of organizational networks, organizational embeddedness, and organizational social performance in the business and nonprofit sector, I proposed a model of embeddedness-based organizational social performance in a managed multi-sector network. I found that organizational embeddedness was contingent on the degree of formality of a tie and the <b>sectoral</b> affiliation of <b>network</b> organizations. I also found that organizational embeddedness was positively and significantly related to trust, reputation, and influence in the purely public and nonprofit sector network, but bore little relationship to trust and reputation in the mixed-sector network, which included for-profit organizations. These results suggest that social capital was maintained in the public sector network, notwithstanding the administrative control of managed care.

The identification of such information sources constitutes the first step towards {{a better understanding of}} agricultural sciences and techniques. Since CTA's prime objective is to facilitate access to agricultural information in ACP countries, it has undertaken the publication of a series of directories on information sources in the field of agriculture and rural development. The first directory dealt with information sources on tropical agriculture in EEC countries. The second which has just been published in English and French, deals with agricultural information sources in ACP countries. Produced with the cooperation of CAB-lnternational in the UK and the International Documentation Centre for Agriculture in Hot Regions (CIDARC) in France, it fulfills two objectives. First, it is a guide for researchers, trainers, extension workers, planners and documentalists engaged in information searches. Second, it helps to promote information exchanges among different ACP countries and between them and EEC countries. It can also help decision-makers to plan their national policies. This directory includes 337 agricultural information services (libraries, documentation centres, bibliographic databases and documentation networks), research institutes, teaching establishments and development organizations in ACP countries. It deals with all agricultural sectors: agronomic research, teaching and extension work, rural sociology and economics, animal and vegetable production, forestry, aquatic sciences and fishing, agricultural equipment, natural resources, food and nutrition sciences and the environment (a classification of these information services by field is given in Table 1). Apart from the directory itself, which is classified by country in alphabetical order, this publication includes an index of the main fields covered by each centre and a list of acronyms. Each entry includes the name of the information service followed by that of its parent organization, its address, date of establishment, and the name and title of the person to contact in addition to the staff numbers. It specifies the field of interest of the centre, its geographical coverage, its documentation resources, its users, the goods and services that it provides, its budget and its documentation cooperation service. The index was inspired primarily by that used by AGROVOC, the multilingual thesaurus of agricultural terminology and the categories used by AGRIS. The detailed analysis of the data contained in this directory reveals the current situation of agricultural documentation in ACP countries. It shows that the first agricultural information services date from the last century. The Jamaican Ministry of Agriculture created its national agricultural library in 1876. Since the 1920 s, the number of such centres has increased rapidly. At the current rate, one can hope to see more than 500 agricultural information sources in ACP countries by the year 2000 A geographical breakdown of this data reveals a strong development in West Africa which hosts more than 36 % of the agricultural information services of ACP countries (see Table 3). Documentation centres appear to be concentrated mainly in the capitals to the detriment of rural areas which would make much-later use of such information. These centres offer traditional services: providing bibliographic searches, summary reviews, lists of documents received, and catalogues of publications and periodicals as well as services for selected diffusion of information and for bibliographic searches. However, the summaries and progress reports receive relatively little attention {{despite the fact that they}} are highly regarded by 'information consumers'. The same is the case for the services of consolidation, evaluation and updating of information. It is true that researchers, teachers and students, who are the main users of these information services, are capable of doing such summaries and analyses themselves. Nevertheless, the demand for summarized information remains high. The dearth of such material is due in part to the lack of competent staff The collections of these information services are, generally speaking, relatively modest. Some centres, however, do have significant documentation resources. On average, each one contains 3217 books, 1534 reports, 375 publications of the parent organization 169 periodical titles and 495 microfiches. As far as equipment is concerned even though ACP countries are the least computerized, it is reassuring to learn that nearly a third of the information services have microcomputers although of many different brands. This diversity of equipment, which also applies to software, is no doubt a result of supply and demand but it creates problems of compatability which makes it difficult to exchange data needed for documentary cooperation. An analysis of such data also reveals that there is a greater reproduction capacity than previously thought. If only 7. 4 % of the information services have their own microfilm reproduction workshops, 55 % of the centres have microfilm or microfiche readers. Finally, the most significant phenomenon in the development of information services in ACP countries over the last decade has been the emergence of documentation networks and the exchange of information and experiences. All of the synergies and economies of scale have been exploited: interlibrary loans development of collective catalogues for periodicals and reference works, standardization of working methods, and promotion of the exploitation of their documentation capital. National <b>sectoral</b> <b>networks</b> have emerged in the Congo (REDICA), Cote d'lvoire (REDACT) and Senegal (REDAS). At regional level, the approach taken has been the establishment of a network reflecting the major socioeconomic and geopolitical concerns. One notes the presence of PADIS, oriented towards socioeconomic development in Africa of POPIN-AFRICA oriented towards the population problems of this continent, and RESADOC in Mali which is primarily concerned with problems related to drought, desertification and environmental protection. At the international level, AGRIS and CARIS remain the main global information systems. The establishment of these networks, no matter what their level, in conjunction with the use of computerized facilities, clearly shows the vitality of the documentation supply in ACP countries. It is certain, however, that these structures remain fragile and do not get sufficient attention or support. A new item must be added to the priorities of these centres: the analysis of agricultural information to provide products that respond better to the real needs of users for summarized documents. In this field, as in many others, the availability of human resources will be the determining factor. For more details, contact: Thiendou Niang.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{networking}} activities amongst {{a cluster of}} independent hotels {{with a view to}} analysing key variables in network development for SMEs. A comparative, longitudinal element is introduced by reference to an earlier study of the same phenomenon, ten years earlier. Of particular interest is the influence of various forms of social capital in the development of informal networks and the inter-play between co-operation and competition over time. Given the time gap between the two studies, the effect of <b>sectoral</b> changes on <b>network</b> development is also examined. The research revisits and extends a previous study of many of the same hotels which were investigated in 1995 over their formal and informal links that were found to be influenced by such factors across two classifications - the business as unit (proximity, perceptions of quality) and the individual respondent (personal social networks and ethnicity). Extending that analysis, social capital concepts and relevant references to embedded networks and kinship groups and co-operative game rules will be introduced in this paper. A highly concentrated population of small, independent hotels in Central London had been identified in the previous research project and it is from this sample that the current research drew and extended its own sample of hotels. With such a high number of hotels in the area a mixture of ‘snowball’ sampling and self-selection was successfully employed. Of the original 29 hotels, 22 have been re-interviewed and complemented by another 19. Of the remainder of the original sample, several had subsequently merged or failed to survive the intervening period. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with owner-managers in all cases using a structured questionnaire that replicated as much as possible of the original questionnaire, with both open and closed questions to allow some individual expression on relevant topics. The quantitative data obtained will be analysed using UCINET software to generate visual representations of networks alongside statistical and cluster analyses. Both academic and policy implications are likely to arise from this research, such as novel insights from such an unique periodic comparison of networks development, the influence of social capital on (formal and informal) network activities and the changing influence and consolidation of hotel groups through mergers and franchising...|$|R
40|$|Motivation [...] Industrial firms survive, sustain and co-evolve by {{participating}} in the sector of innovation and production through industrial transactions with each other. However, {{it is difficult for}} specialized firms to be aware of and manage accordingly the kind of systemic constraints and opportunities induced by relevant but indirect transactions, as well as the technological and economic requirements of their value chains, which they cannot control or even sufficiently observe. The myopia may cause specialized firms to implement incorrect strategies, leave them vulnerable to system failures or ignorant of emerging opportunities. This implies a paradox: the simultaneous needs to specialize and to understand and manage the big picture of the eco-system. Goal [...] Previous industry studies have focused on the question if a transaction with an external firm is needed rather than in-house production, and on empirical work from single industries or bilateral relationships between firms. Meanwhile, the firms' positions in the <b>sectoral</b> transactional <b>network</b> are also influential to the success and performance of firms. In this dissertation, I conduct transactional network analysis to explore how firms are organized in the sector of aggregated industries, in order to shed light on the set of previously ignored knowledge on industrial transactions, which is valuable to single firms in designing strategies and managing operations but is not available from firm- and industry-level analysis. Hierarchy in Industry Architecture [...] At the sector level, existing theories often assumed hierarchical or non-hierarchical relationships among industrial firms, and quantitative evidence on variable degrees of hierarchy in industry sectors is lacking. This dissertation first identifies and defines the type of hierarchy relevant to industry studies -flow hierarchy, develops a network-based metric on the degree of hierarchy (one-way flow of transactions), and applies it to the transaction data from two industrial sectors in Japan. The empirical results show that the electronics sector exhibits a significantly lower degree of hierarchy than the automotive sector due to the presence of many transaction cycles. It shows that the simplistic hierarchy hypothesis for production sectors does not always hold. Industrial Network Model and Transaction Specificity [...] I further create a network simulation model with random networks to relate sector-level hierarchy degrees to firm-level behavioral variables, and infer transaction specificity, i. e. {{the extent to which a}} firm is captive to a niche of customers positioned closely in the industrial network hierarchy. The model builds on three basic rules on market structures, i. e. hierarchy, niche, and the mapping relationship between roles and positions. Transaction specificity provides a way to quantify the tendency of a firm to fix or institutionalize its role according to its relative network position, or where the transactions of a firm are oriented in the value chains, whereas traditional studies analyze whether a transaction versus in-house production is needed. The result shows that transaction specificity in the electronics sector is quantitatively much lower than that in the automotive sector. Interviews and Firm Boundary Strategies [...] I further conducted interviews with nine firms in the two sectors and found that, with decision rationales related to product modularity, innovation dynamics and asset specificity, the major electronics firms take the permeable vertical boundary strategy and diversified horizontal boundary strategy, which decrease transaction specificity so that many transaction cycles emerge in the electronics sector. My analysis shows the permeability of a firm's vertical boundary, i. e. playing multiple value chain roles, is the necessary condition for transaction cycles to emerge. Meanwhile, these two strategies are not feasible in the automotive sector according to interviews. They are also not observed in the American electronics sector. My data show the American electronics firms tend to be vertically specialized in the value chains. Social-Technical Arguments [...] Linking network analysis results, interview data, and the prior work on the physical limits to product modularity, I argue that higher power level of a sector's technologies leads to higher transaction specificity, and more hierarchical transaction lows across the sector. High power technologies constrain strategic transaction choices, while lower power technologies enable a larger option space of transaction strategies, for companies to explore and exploit. Implications [...] For academics, the use of network analysis permits transaction cost analysis, or more general analysis of transaction-related decisions, to be extended from the boundary of a firm to the architecture of a sector comprising related industries. It gives us a bird's-eye view to observe firm-level transaction behaviors and create new knowledge on transaction specificity. In addition, the analysis of the physical properties of product technologies allows us to interpret the difference in transaction specificities and hierarchy degrees of different sectors, which economic and sociology theories cannot explain. For industry practitioners, this research suggests that firms' choices for industrial transactions are under some predictable constraints from product technologies. A better understanding of the linkages between industry architecture, firm transaction strategy, and product technology, in turn can guide companies to tailor transaction strategies to implicit technological constraints and to adequately explore strategic options made feasible by technologies. by Jianxi Luo.
