40|$|Aim : The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine acute muscle damage after {{different}} sequences of an upper-body resistance exercise session. Methods : Twelve untrained men completed two sessions (three sets; 80 % one repetition maximum; two min passive rest between sets) of the same exercises in opposite sequences (larger <b>to</b> <b>smaller</b> vs. <b>smaller</b> <b>to</b> larger muscle group exercises). For each session, serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations were measured before exercise (pre) and 24, 48 hours after each sequence (24 P, 48 P). Results: Within sequence (larger <b>to</b> <b>smaller</b> muscle-group exercises), significant differences in CK concentrations were demonstrated between most time points (P 0. 05). Conclusion: These results suggest that muscle damage was similar between sequences (larger <b>to</b> <b>smaller</b> vs. <b>smaller</b> <b>to</b> larger muscle-group exercises) ...|$|R
