5|$|Summer {{distribution}} of fin whales in the North Pacific is the immediate offshore waters from central Baja California to Japan {{and as far}} north as the Chukchi Sea bordering the Arctic Ocean. They occur in high densities in the northern Gulf of Alaska and southeastern Bering Sea between May and October, with <b>some</b> <b>movement</b> through the Aleutian passes {{into and out of the}} Bering Sea. Several whales tagged between November and January off southern California were killed in the summer off central California, Oregon, British Columbia, and in the Gulf of Alaska. Fin whales have been observed feeding 250 miles south of Hawaii in mid-May, and several winter sightings have been made there. Some researchers have suggested that the whales migrate into Hawaiian waters primarily in the autumn and winter.|$|E

25|$|Traveller was a {{horse of}} great stamina and was usually a good horse for {{an officer in}} battle because he was {{difficult}} to frighten.

At the Second Battle of Bull Run, while General Lee was at the front reconnoitering, dismounted and holding Traveller by the bridle, the horse became frightened at <b>some</b> <b>movement</b> of the enemy and, plunging, pulled Lee down on a stump, breaking both of his hands. Lee went through the remainder of that campaign chiefly in an ambulance. When he rode on horseback, a courier rode in front leading his horse.|$|E

25|$|In 1999 {{researchers}} at Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, Ohio, led by Hunter Peckham, used 64-electrode EEG skullcap to return limited hand movements to quadriplegic Jim Jatich. As Jatich concentrated on simple but opposite concepts like up and down, his beta-rhythm EEG output was analysed using software to identify {{patterns in the}} noise. A basic pattern was identified and used to control a switch: Above average activity was set to on, below average off. As well as enabling Jatich to control a computer cursor the signals were also used to drive the nerve controllers embedded in his hands, restoring <b>some</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
25|$|MEG is {{also being}} used to better {{localize}} responses in the brain. The openness of the MEG setup allows external auditory and visual stimuli to be easily introduced. <b>Some</b> <b>movement</b> by the subject is also possible {{as long as it}} does not jar the subject's head. The responses in the brain before, during, and after the introduction of such stimuli/movement can then be mapped with greater spatial resolution than was previously possible with EEG. Psychologists are also taking advantage of MEG neuroimaging to better understand relationships between brain function and behavior. For example, a number of studies have been done comparing the MEG responses of patients with psychological troubles to control patients. There has been great success isolating unique responses in patients with schizophrenia, such as auditory gating deficits to human voices. MEG {{is also being}} used to correlate standard psychological responses, such as the emotional dependence of language comprehension.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 24 June, a 10-men team led by Subedar Harnam Singh was sent out. Another team led by Subedar Sansar Chand {{followed}} it at a distance. A third team led by Naib Subedar Bana Singh was kept as a reserve force to be deployed in case the first assault team was stalled due to enemy fire. Harnam Singh's team managed to find the rope and the dead bodies of Pande's patrol. The Indian soldiers started climbing the ice wall. They had barely covered a distance of 50 m, when their scout Naik Tara Chand noticed <b>some</b> <b>movement</b> in the front. Alerted by Tara Chand, the Indian soldiers started moving down. But before they could take up the firing positions, the Pakistanis opened fire with medium machine guns. Tara Chand and two others were killed instantaneously. The troops following them were unable to fire back as their weapons had jammed in the -25°C temperature. Later, the Indians found that the Pakistanis were heating their weapons with a kerosene stove kept below the weapon. Harnam Singh's men first took shelter behind icicles, and then hurriedly dug shallow trenches in the ice. The Indian artillery designated to cover them {{could not be used}} to full extent, as there was danger of them being hurt. Ultimately, the attack had to be abandoned.|$|E

25|$|This {{game was}} part of a double header at the Garda RFC Westmanstown. The Vikings {{entering}} the game as huge underdogs {{for the first time in}} many years. Making matters worse the Vikings lost starting QB Marc Ashworth and Starting RB Ryan Meches to unforeseen circumstances leaving them with a 22-man squad facing the Champions. The game started positively for the Vikings on offence gathering some first downs and field position. The Defence which was the story of the day matched the champions in every aspect and looked a better outfit than the one that lost to Belfast in the Shamrock bowl the year before. As the first half came to a close the score was a measly 0–0 with both teams showing why they have been dominant in Irish football in recent years. The Vikings cam out in the second half hoping to get <b>some</b> <b>movement</b> on offence with their Defence continuing to be Dominant and impressive. The Vikings turned to players like ever present Kieran Coen to play both sides of the ball and he was the best player on the field on the day. With many other players such as Ian Cahill, Craig Switzer, Michael Guinane, Kieran Coen, Adrian Garvey and Sean Goldrick playing Offence, Defence and Special teams the game started to wear on the Vikings. 0-0 entering the 4th quarter in unprecedented 28 degree heat there was an air of inevitability about the game with the Vikings continually running 3 and outs on offence something had to give. With less than 10 minutes left and the Trojans creeping into Viking territory there was a sense that a big play needed to be made on Defence if they were going to have a shot of knocking off the Trojans. That chance came with a well read pass from the Trojans QB by Craig Switzer. The ball in his hands with 60 yards of clear field in front of the speedster nickel star of the Vikings and he took his eye off the ball and it fell on the turf. The crowd, the team and everyone else knew that was the chance and sure enough 3 plays later the Trojans constant Barrage finally broke the Vikings Defensive wall and ran in for a 20-yard score with 7 minutes left. The Trojans stopped the Vikings offense after some gutsy first downs by QB Paul Keane, RB/DL Ian Cahill and WR Sean Goldrick. The Trojans played the clock down to minutes left and with the game getting away from them the Vikings Defence gave up another score leaving it 14–0 final score.|$|E

500|$|Bennet cut {{her hair}} for the season, {{in order to}} further her character's {{transformation}} to the Daisy Johnson / Quake of the comics, while not cutting her hair as short as her comic counterpart.

We wanted to stay true to the comic book character fans love; I wanted to please them but also make sure there was still <b>some</b> <b>movement</b> and length and sexiness in the hair."

Maybe it says 'Do not open until Christmas' or 'Watch The Simpsons on Sunday night,' knowing Fox." [...] To create the episode's auditory effects, sound editor Bruce Tanis explained his production steps in an interview with Designing Sound, [...] "'Earthling' was a really good episode for strange sounds. It starts out with the appearance of a smoke monster that kills its victims by enveloping them and leaving behind an exact life-like looking corpse only the body is made of ash which crumbles horribly when touched. The smoke creature moved rapidly as opposed to gently drifting so I had <b>some</b> <b>movement</b> to play off of in creating a sound for him. I came up with some stuttering, fluttery whooshes that kind of vibrated which made him more dangerous than if he sounded like a puff of steam moving along the hall. The smoke monster requires a host body to live in when he's not vibrating around killing people. The only way to recall the smoke monster to the host body, or to keep him there in the first place, is by severe electrical shock." ...|$|E
500|$|North Atlantic fin {{whales are}} defined by the International Whaling Commission to exist in one of seven {{discrete}} population zones: Nova Scotia-New England, Newfoundland-Labrador, western Greenland, eastern Greenland-Iceland, North Norway, West Norway-Faroe Islands, and Ireland-Spain-United Kingdom-Portugal. Results of mark-and-recapture surveys have indicated that <b>some</b> <b>movement</b> occurs across the boundaries of these zones, suggesting {{that they are not}} entirely discrete and that some immigration and emigration does occur. Sigurjónsson estimated in 1995 that total pre-exploitation population size in the entireNorth Atlantic ranged between 50,000 and 100,000 animals, but his research is criticized for lack of supporting data and an explanation of his reasoning. In 1977, D.E. Sergeant suggested a [...] "primeval" [...] aggregate total of 30,000 to 50,000 throughout the North Atlantic. Of that number, 8,000 to 9,000 would have resided in the Newfoundland and Nova Scotia areas, with whales summering in U.S. waters south of Nova Scotia presumably omitted. J.M. Breiwick estimated that the [...] "exploitable" [...] (above the legal size limit of 50ft) component of the Nova Scotia population was 1,500 to 1,600 animals in 1964, reduced to only about 325 in 1973. Two aerial surveys in Canadian waters since the early 1970s gave numbers of 79 to 926 whales on the eastern Newfoundland-Labrador shelf in August 1980, and a few hundred in the northern and central Gulf of Saint Lawrence in August 1995– 1996. Summer estimates in the waters off western Greenland range between 500 and 2,000, and in 1974, Jonsgard considered the fin whales off Western Norway and the Faroe Islands to [...] "have been considerably depleted in postwar years, probably by overexploitation". The population around Iceland appears to have fared much better, and in 1981, appeared to have undergone only a minor decline since the early 1960s. Surveys during the summers of 1987 and 1989 estimated of 10,000 to 11,000 between eastern Greenland and Norway. This shows a substantial recovery when compared to a survey in 1976 showing an estimate of 6,900, which was considered to be a [...] "slight" [...] decline since 1948. A Spanish NASS survey in 1989 of the France-Portugal-Spain sub-area estimated a summer population range at 17,355.|$|E
