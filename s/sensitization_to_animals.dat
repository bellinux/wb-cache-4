40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{knowledge}} about allergic sensitization {{and its relationship}} with clinical symptoms and diseases among adults in South-East Asia is poor. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence and pattern of allergic sensitization and the association with asthma and allergic rhinitis in adults in urban and rural Vietnam. METHODS: Among 5, 782 responders to a questionnaire survey in northern Vietnam, a random sample was invited to a clinical follow-up and 684 (46 %) participated. The methods included a structured interview using a modified GA 2 LEN study questionnaire on symptoms and possible determinants for diseases. Skin prick test (SPT) with ten common airborne indoor and outdoor allergens, lung function test, and methacholine test was performed among subjects ≤ 60  years of age. RESULTS: In total, one third of subjects had a positive SPT reaction to at least one allergen, 36. 9 % of men and 31. 0 % of women (n. s.). The most common sensitizer was the storage mite B. tropicalis (men 27. 7 %; women 18. 7 %) followed by house dust mite D. pteronyssinus (men 16. 5 %; women 10. 6 %), and D. farinae (men 15. 3 %; women 6. 3 %), and cockroach (men 16. 5 %; women 10. 2 %). Sensitization to all major allergens were significantly more common among men and among subjects ≤ 45  years compared with women and subjects > 45  years, respectively. The prevalence of <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> <b>animals,</b> pollen and molds were low. The majority of cockroach-sensitized subjects were also sensitized to mites. Sensitization to any allergen and all major allergens were significantly associated with rhinitis, but not with asthma. However, bronchial hyper-reactivity was significantly associated with increasing number of positive SPTs (p[*]=[*] 0. 047). CONCLUSIONS: Among adults in northern Vietnam sensitization to mite and cockroach most common in both rural and urban areas. The dominant sensitizer was the storage mite B. tropicalis, which should be included in future studies and also in clinical practice, owing to its association with clinical symptoms. As in the Western world allergic sensitization was associated with rhinitis and bronchial hyper-reactivity. The lack of association with asthma in South-East Asia needs to be studied further...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLung {{function}} (FEV 1 {{before and}} after bronchodilatation) was studied prospectively over five visits in 55 asthmatic children (28 boys) from childhood to adulthood (age 30). At the last follow-up recordings were made at rest, after cold air challenge (CACh), and after bronchodilatation. Results were related to clinical asthma scoring and <b>to</b> <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> furred <b>animals,</b> as described in a companion paper. Lung function outcome was shown {{to be influenced by}} initial FEV 1 (% predicted) and gender, but not by initial asthma severity or sensitization. FEV 1 (% predicted) was higher in females than in males over the first two follow-ups, but the reverse was found over the subsequent visits. It deteriorated from childhood to adulthood in the females but improved in the males. In adulthood the females (for height 170 cm) had a steeper normalized annual fall in post-bronchodilator FEV 1 than the males (55 ± 38 vs. 25 ± 36 ml;P= 0 · 006). The degree of bronchial hyper-responsiveness was associated significantly with asthma severity and the extent of <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> furred <b>animals,</b> but not with gender. The results indicate a better lung function outcome for asthmatic boys than for girls, confirming trends seen in clinical asthma severity.

40|$|AbstractThe further {{course of}} asthma severity, lung function, {{bronchial}} hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to cold air challenge (CACh), clinical allergies and allergic sensitization in young middle adulthood was studied in {{a cohort of}} 55 subjects with childhood asthma. All subjects (27 females) have attended all five previous and the current follow-up visit, undertaken at {{a mean age of}} 35 years. Twelve subjects (22 %) reported no current asthma, 28 (51 %) mild/intermittent, and 15 (27 %) moderate/severe asthma. Asthma severity changed little in the individual subjects over the last 5 -year period. Females continued to have higher asthma severity scores than the males, but the previously noted lower resting and post-bronchodilator % predicted FEV 1 in females was not confirmed now. Pathological BHR to CACh tended to be more common among the males. Forty-four subjects were still allergic <b>to</b> <b>animal</b> danders and 35 <b>to</b> pollens. <b>Sensitization</b> rates (skin prick test or RAST) were similar to those recorded 5 years earlier and there was no clear evidence of tolerance developing.

40|$|Background: Laboratory {{animal allergy}} (LAA) is {{frequent}} in exposed workers despite {{working conditions and}} exposure to these allergens having improved over the last decade. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess LAA in students and workers in a research facility within the framework of a prevention programme. Subjects and methods: Students and researchers working with laboratory animals underwent medical surveillance every year from 2001 to 2012. They filled in a standardized questionnaire for the assessment of allergic respiratory symptoms and exposure conditions. Skin prick tests with common allergens, latex and hair extract from laboratory animals were performed at the first control and after three years of exposure. Results: 198 women and 120 men with a mean age of 29. 1 ± 7. 3 years and a work seniority of 3. 1 ± 6. 5 years participated in the study. <b>Sensitization</b> <b>to</b> laboratory <b>animals</b> ranged between 11. 8 and 14. 8 % according to work seniority. Sixteen subjects (5 %) reported asthma and 25 (7. 9 %) rhinitis when working with laboratory animals. LAA was associated with the female gender (OR 3. 1; IC 95 % 2. 3 - 5. 8), with atopy by prick test (OR 7. 0; IC 95 % 2. 9 - 16. 9), and with <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> laboratory <b>animals</b> (OR 2. 7; IC 95 % 1. 1 - 6. 7). Conclusion: This study revealed a low level of sensitization and symptoms of allergy <b>to</b> laboratory <b>animals</b> as a result of the preventive measures adopted to reduce exposure, but there is nonetheless a need to improve prevention so as to completely avoid the onset of LAA in students and workers...|$|R
40|$|Exposure <b>to</b> <b>animal</b> allergens {{constitutes}} a relevant {{risk factor for}} the development of allergic sensitization. Moreover, an increasing number of people become owners of less common animals. In this article we summarize aspects related <b>to</b> <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> cat/dog which may be applied also to uncommon pets or other furry animals. The data discussed here suggest that several different factors may induce allergic <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> furry <b>animals</b> with or without previous contact. Allergic sensitization without animal exposure is a relevant risk for patients because they are not aware about the possibility that even severe respiratory symptoms may develop after an occasional animal contact. This aspect should be taken into account by susceptible individuals before acquiring pets or beginning a contact for working/leisure activity with a common as well as uncommon animal. As a consequence, skin prick test and/or evaluation of specific IgE antibodies (by classic ImmunoCAP or micro-array technique ImmunoCAP ISAC) also to less common ("new") mammalian allergens could be recommended in individuals already sensitized to common pets to identify the occurrence of allergic <b>sensitization</b> and consequently <b>to</b> avoid future exposures <b>to</b> uncommon <b>animal</b> allergens...|$|R

Rat-specific IgE antibodies were measured in sera, and allergen-specific and nonspecific cytokine responses were measured in whole blood and in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Results: Self-reported allergic symptoms {{were related to the}} presence of rat-specific IgE (P < 0. 01). Cases developed a rat allergen-specific interleukin (IL) - 4 response during sensitization, while controls did not show an increased IL- 4 response (at visit D: 33 vs 5 IL- 4 producing cells/ 106 cells, P < 0. 001). The IL- 4 response was related to the levels of rat-specific IgE in cases (visit D: rho = 0. 706, P < 0. 001). By contrast, allergen-specific IL- 10 and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) responses as well as nonspecific cytokine responses were comparable between cases and controls. Conclusion: This study is the first to show the development of an allergen-specific IL- 4 response in adult human subjects during allergen-specific sensitization. This IL- 4 response was quantitatively associated with the development of the specific IgE antibodies.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{transportability}} {{of an existing}} diagnostic questionnaire model for the <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> laboratory <b>animal</b> (LA) allergens. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The model was externally validated in 414 Canadian animal health apprentices. Several approaches were used: (1) no adjustment; (2) recalibration of the intercept of the model; (3) re-estimation of the intercept and the regression coefficients of predictors; and (4) model revision, by excluding the existing predictor(s) and/or including new predictor(s). The bootstrapping procedure was done following {{the third and fourth}} methods. The calibration was assessed graphically and with the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test. Discriminative properties were determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC area). RESULTS: When applied without adjustment, the model's discriminative ability was adequate (ROC area was 0. 74 vs. the original ROC area of 0. 76); the calibration was poor (HL test P 0. 10) and reasonable discrimination (ROC area ranged between 0. 73 and 0. 75). The refitted and revised model showed a good internal validity (correction factor from the bootstrapping procedure was more than 0. 90). CONCLUSION: Once updated, the diagnostic model is valid and can be applied with reasonable performance in an animal health apprentice setting...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} aspect of allergic <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> furry <b>animals</b> is the association of dog and cat exposure in early childhood with the incidence of respective allergies later in life. This topic is very controversial, because some authors have found a "facilitating" effect, while others have noticed a "protective" or even no significant effect in individuals living in urban areas. It is likely that some biases could be responsible of these contradictory findings. Cat/dog ownership or their presence in indoor environments are considered usually the main criteria to assess the exposure to these pets in studies' questionnaires. Even in clinical practice "are there animals at home?" is the common query usually done when collecting anamnestic data. In our opinion, these commonly used questions {{should not be considered}} the main index of exposure to pet allergens, because they can lead to erroneous interpretation of the clinical significance of positive skin prick tests for pet allergens {{as well as of the}} real risk of exposure to allergens of dog/cat in epidemiological studies. Consequently, we suggest a new, more realistic, classification of modalities of exposure to pet allergens in "real life" based on five possible conditions...|$|R
40|$|Background: Allergic {{sensitization}} is {{the most}} important risk factor for asthma and rhinitis among children, adolescents and young adults. Less is known about the incidence and remission of allergic sensitization, particularly in older adults. Furthermore, it is not clear if the earlier documented increase in prevalence of allergic sensitization continues. This thesis is focused on prevalence, incidence and remission of allergic <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> airborne allergens among adolescents and adults as well as on time trends in prevalence among adults. Furthermore, associated risk factors and the relation of allergic <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> asthma and rhinitis were assessed. Methods: In the study of children and adolescents, incidence, remission and prevalence of allergic sensitization were assessed in a cohort study of schoolchildren, aged 7 - 8 years (y) at baseline. In the studies of adults, incidence and remission of allergic sensitization were assessed in a randomly selected adult population sample in 1994 (n= 664) aged 20 - 69 y, which was followed up in 2004 (n= 555). Trends in prevalence of allergic sensitization were assessed by comparing two cross-sectional studies; the cohort from 1994 and another randomly selsected population sample examined in 2009 (n= 737). The relation of allergic <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> asthma and rhinitis was determined in the adult cohort in 2009. Allergic sensitization was assessed by skin prick test (SPT) with ten common airborne allergens at ages 7 - 8, 11 - 12 and 19 y in the cohort of children and in the participants ≤ 60 y in the adult cohorts. Specific IgE to nine airborne allergens was analyzed in the adult cohorts in 2004 and 2009. Risk factors for allergic sensitization and variables defining respiratory disease and symptoms were assessed by questionnaires in the cohort of children and by structured interviews in the adult cohorts. Results: The 10 -year cumulative incidence of allergic sensitization among the adults from 1994 to 2004 was 5 %, while remission was 32 %. In both adult cohorts, the prevalence of allergic sensitization was highest among young adults, aged 20 - 29 y, 55 % and 61 % and decreased significantly with increasing age. Among children and adolescents, both incidence and persistence of allergic sensitization were high, and the prevalence of allergic sensitization increased by age from 21 % at age 7 - 8 y to 42 % at age 19 y. Multisensitization at age 19 y was strongly associated with early onset of sensitization. The prevalence of <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> the major specific allergens birch, timothy, cat and dog as well as multisensitization (from 40 % in 1994 to 56 % in 2009, p= 0. 002) increased significantly from 1994 to 2009 among the adults. <b>Sensitization</b> <b>to</b> any allergen increased from 35 % to 39 %, however not significantly (p= 0. 13). A family history of allergic rhinitis was strongly and consistently associated with allergic sensitization in all ages. Male sex and urban living were significantly positively and birth order and furry animals at home in childhood were negatively associated with onset of sensitization before the age of 7 - 8 y, but not with onset of sensitization from 11 - 12 y to 19 y. Young adult age and urban living were significant factors associated with allergic sensitization in adult age. <b>Sensitization</b> <b>to</b> any <b>animal</b> was significantly positively associated with current asthma (OR 4. 80 (95 % CI 2. 68 - 8. 60)), whereas both <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> any pollen (OR 4. 25 (2. 55 - 7. 06)) and any animal (OR 3. 90 (95 % CI 2. 31 - 6. 58)) were associated with current allergic rhinitis. The association between allergic sensitization and allergic rhinitis was strongest in young adult age and decreased with increasing age, while asthma was similarly associated with <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> any <b>animal</b> across all adult ages. Among asthmatics, the prevalence of allergic sensitization decreased with increasing age of asthma onset. Conclusion: Both incidence and persistence of allergic sensitization were high among children and adolescents explaining the increase in prevalence by increasing age. An inverse pattern with low incidence and high remission of allergic sensitization was seen among adults. The decrease in prevalence of allergic sensitization by increasing adult age might at least partly be explained by normal ageing and not only by an effect of year of birth (cohort effect). The significant increase in prevalence of <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> the specific allergens explained the significant increase in multisensitization over 15 years. A family history of allergy was the strongest and the only consistent risk factor for allergic sensitization in all ages. The prevalence of allergic sensitization decreased with increasing age of asthma onset among adult asthmatics...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} there are {{described}} methods for grading the local skin reactivity induced by bacterial filtrates. The grading {{is accomplished by}} titration of the skin-preparatory factors; and by studies on the duration of ensuing reactivity. It {{was found that the}} duration of reactivity depends upon the mode of preparation of filtrates and the microorganisms employed. Thus, it lasts for 96 hours with meningococcus "agar washings" filtrates; for 72 hours with B. typhosus "agar washings" filtrates; it disappears within 48 hours with B. typhosus tryptic digest broth culture filtrate and B. typhosus "agar washings" filtrates previously heated in the Arnold sterilizer for 20 minutes. Comparative titrations of the preparations employed demonstrate that the duration of reactivity is in direct relationship to the reacting potency. It is also shown that the skin-preparatory potency of the filtrates and the duration of the ensuing local reactivity are not modified by cellular anaphylactic <b>sensitization</b> (Arthus phenomenon) <b>to</b> <b>animal</b> proteins.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of sulfite intolerance are unknown. It {{has been suggested}} that, in some cases, it {{could be due to}} a partial sulfite-oxidase deficiency. In these patients, this enzyme is unable to metabolize adequately an overload of ingested or inhaled exogenous sulfite, triggering a bronch-ospasm. Cyanocobalamin is able to catalyze the extracellu-lar oxidation of sulfites, preventing sulfite accumulation and the subsequent symptoms due to this excess. Methods A 36 y. o. woman was attended at our allergy Clinic after suffering repeated anaphylactic episodes and an anaphylac-tic shock, 60 minutes after eating different foods. The aller-gic study confirmed <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> pollens, <b>animal</b> dander, dust mites, molds and PR- 10 proteins (ImmunoCAP Isac, Thermofisher, Sweden). We performed a double-blind placebo controlled challenge (DBPCC) with sulfites. She reacted with 50 mg of metabisulfite with facial flushing, rhinitis and bronchospasm (FEV 1 decrease> 20 %). We recommended a sulfite avoidance diet, but two months later she came back complaining of great difficulty to avoid sulfite given the ubiquity of this additive in nearly all foods. We performed another sulfite challenge with cyanoco-balamin pretreatment. Results We pre-treated the patient with 4 mcg of cyanocobalamin 1 hour before repeating de sulfite challenge. We increased the sulfite dose every 20 minutes, from 5 mg to 200 mg. The challenge test was negative. We recommended the patient to take every day 4 mcg of cyanocobalamin in order to prevent anaphylactic reactions from inadvertent exposure to sulfites and to continue with a sulfite avoidance diet. Since then, she has been stable, without asthma exacerbation or anaphylactic reactions.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Early-onset atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) {{is a particular}} phenotype that may convey a risk of developing multiple <b>sensitizations</b> <b>to</b> allergens but {{little is known about}} the pathway of sensitization. The aims of this study were to describe the natural history of <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> allergens for this phenotype and to identify the most predictive marker associated with the risk of developing <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> inhaled allergens in a well-selected cohort of infants with AD. METHODS: Infants with active AD were enrolled and prospectively explored for biological markers of atopy every year until the age of 6 yr. Allergic sensitization was defined as the presence of positive specific IgEs to allergens and multiple sensitizations as being sensitized to ≥ 2 allergens. Elevated blood eosinophilia was defined as an eosinophil blood count ≥ 470 eosinophils/mm 3 and elevated total IgE as a serum IgE level ≥ 45 kU/l. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-nine infants were included. Elevated blood eosinophilia was observed at baseline in 60 children (26. 2 %) and elevated total IgE in 85 (37. 1 %). When elevated at baseline, eosinophilia and IgE levels remained significantly higher during the follow-up period. <b>Sensitization</b> <b>to</b> food allergens decreased from 58 % to 34 %, whereas <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> inhaled allergens increased over time from 17 % to 67 %.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 42 of the 151 bakeries that are present in the city of Douala. Demographics, clinical data, as well as results of skin prick tests to wheat flour, α-amylase and common aeroallergens were collected from all participants. A logistic regression model of the SPSS. 20 software was used to identify factors associated with <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> wheat flour and α-amylase. Results: Of the 229 participants included in the study, 222 (96. 9 %) were male. The mean age was 36. 3 ± 8. 9 years.

40|$|Background: Reports {{of adverse}} {{reactions}} to foods are increasing, {{but there is}} limited information on the comparative prevalence of <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> food allergens using standardized methods. Methods: Sera from the 'random sample' of young adults seen during {{the second phase of}} the European Community Respiratory Health Survey were analysed for IgE against 24 foods using ImmunoCAP. Sera were tested on five food mixes, and subsequently on individual foods in each positive mix. Results: Sera from 4522 individuals living in 13 countries were tested for at least one food allergen mix. Prevalence of <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> any of the 24 food allergens ranged from 24. 6 % in Portland (USA) to 7. 7 % in Reykjavik (Iceland). With few exceptions, the relative prevalence of <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> different foods was similar in all countries. <b>Sensitization</b> rates <b>to</b> egg, fish and milk were each less than 1 %, and the most common sensitizations are not represented in current commercial mixes. The prevalence of <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> foods was not related <b>to</b> that of <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> aeroallergens but was related to the geometric mean total IgE for the country. Conclusions: <b>Sensitization</b> <b>to</b> foods is common but highly variable. The relative prevalence of <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> different foods is more consistent than would be expected by chance, suggesting that quantity of consumption of specific foods does not determine prevalence. The aetiology of food sensitization is only partly similar to that for aeroallergens but is related to local levels of total IgE.

40|$|Background: Refractory {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease (GERD) can {{be related}} <b>to</b> greater <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> foods. Objective: <b>To</b> evaluate <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> foods in patients with refractory GERD. Methods: Patients with refractory GERD after using at least 40 mg of a proton pump inhibitor were given a restriction diet {{based on the results}} of skin prick testing and atopy patch testing with foods. The characteristics of sensitized patients were compared with those of nonsensitized patients in relation to atopy and number of eosinophils in the esophageal mucosa. Results: The prevalence of <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> foods was 27. 7 %. Asthmatic patients showed higher <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> foods (P =. 008). Eosinophils were determined to be present in the esophageal mucosa in 15. 8 % of patients, and this correlated with greater <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> foods (P =. 01). One case of eosinophilic esophagitis was confirmed. A diet excluding identified sensitizing foods led to clinical improvement regarding GERD symptoms (P =. 004). Conclusion: The presence of eosinophils in esophageal mucosa associated with greater <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> foods and the response to a restriction diet in patients with positive test results suggest that refractory GERD can represent an initial stage of eosinophilic esophagitis.

40|$|P>Background: The {{modified}} Th 2 response, {{defined as}} an IgG 4 response {{in the absence of}} IgE, is suggested to protect against the development of allergic sensitization. However, studies suggesting this protective effect all had a cross-sectional design, making it impossible to study the development of both responses. Aim of the study: We aimed to study the dynamics in IgG 4 antibodies in relation <b>to</b> allergic <b>sensitization</b> in an occupational cohort of starting laboratory animal workers. Moreover, we studied the relation between exposure, antibody responses, atopy and self reported allergic symptoms. Methods: A total of 110 starting animal workers were followed for 2 years. IgG 4 antibodies against rats and mice were assessed. Workers were tested for allergic <b>sensitization</b> and exposure <b>to</b> <b>animal</b> allergens was estimated. Symptom status was assessed using questionnaires. Results: Rat and mouse specific IgG 4 antibodies were present before the development of allergy and did not significantly change over time. Allergic <b>sensitization</b> was related <b>to</b> exposure and atopic status but high levels of IgG 4 showed no protective effect. In contrary, workers that developed mouse specific sensitization during follow up had higher levels of mouse specific IgG 4. Symptoms were related <b>to</b> allergic <b>sensitization</b> and IgG 4 levels did not influence that relationship. Conclusions: IgG 4 antibodies are present before IgE antibodies develop and IgG 4 levels are stable over time.

40|$|BACKGROUND Complaints of 'food allergy' are increasing. Standardized {{surveys of}} IgE <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> foods are still {{uncommon}} and multicountry surveys are rare. We have assessed IgE <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> food-associated allergens in {{different regions of}} Europe using a common protocol. METHODS Participants from general populations aged 20 - 54 years in eight European centres (Zurich, Madrid, Utrecht, Lodz, Sophia, Athens, Reykjavik and Vilnius) were asked whether they had allergic symptoms associated with specific foods. Weighted samples of those with and without allergic symptoms then completed a longer questionnaire and donated serum for IgE analysis by ImmunoCAP for 24 foods, 6 aeroallergens and, by allergen microarray, for 48 individual food proteins. RESULTS The prevalence of IgE <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> foods ranged from 23. 6 % to 6. 6 %. The least common IgE <b>sensitizations</b> were <b>to</b> fish (0. 2 %), milk (0. 8 %) and egg (0. 9 %), and the most common were to hazelnut (9. 3 %), peach (7. 9 %) and apple (6. 5 %). The order of prevalence of IgE sensitization against different foods was similar in each centre and correlated with the prevalence of the pollen-associated allergens Bet v 1 and Bet v 2 (r = 0. 86).

40|$|ABSTRACT Levels of the anaphylatoxin C 3 a are {{increased}} {{in patients with}} asthma compared with those in nonasthmatics and in-crease further still during asthma exacerbations. However, the role of C 3 a during <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> allergen is poorly understood. <b>Sensitization</b> <b>to</b> fungal allergens, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, is a strong risk factor {{for the development of}} asthma. Exposure to chitin, a structural polysaccharide of the fungal cell wall, induces innate allergic inflammation andmay promote <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> fungal allergens. Here, we found that coincubation of chitin with serum or intratracheal administration of chitin in mice re-sulted in the generation of C 3 a. We established a model of chitin-dependent <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> soluble Aspergillus antigens to test the contribution of complement to these events. C 3 / and C 3 aR/mice were protected from chitin-dependent <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> Aspergillus and had reduced lung eosinophilia and type 2 cytokines and serum IgE. In contrast, complement-deficient mice were not protected against chitin-induced innate allergic inflammation. In sensitized mice, plasmacytoid dendritic cells from complement-deficient animals acquired a tolerogenic profile associated with enhanced regulatory T cell responses and sup-pressed Th 2 and Th 17 responses specific for Aspergillus. Thus, chitin induces the generation of C 3 a in the lung, and chitin-dependent allergic <b>sensitization</b> <b>to</b> Aspergillus requires C 3 aR signaling, which suppresses regulatory dendritic cells and T cells and induces allergy-promoting T cells...|$|R
