5|$|In public <b>statuary,</b> the Magyars's mythical Turul symbolises {{national}} power and nobility, and {{is represented by}} many statues in Hungary, including the largest bird statue in the world, on a mountain near Tatabánya.|$|E
5|$|Much {{architecture}} and <b>statuary</b> {{in the town}} centre is dedicated to Malvern water, including the St Ann's Well, which is housed in a building dating from 1813.|$|E
5|$|After the Acts of Union in 1707 {{the royal}} family spent very little time in, or money on, Scottish palaces and many Scottish nobles {{followed}} the royal court to England, tending to invest in sculpture for their residences in London, rather than their estates in Scotland. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public <b>statuary,</b> often with the patronage of a public institution, such as the lead figure of George II at the newly founded Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh in 1753 or {{the figure of the}} judge Duncan Forbes for the Outer Parliament House in 1752. The portrait bust, designed for interior display, also became popular. By the middle of the century <b>statuary</b> were preferred to painted portraits among the aristocracy.|$|E
50|$|Another {{well-known}} {{example of}} a bridge hosting statues is the Charles Bridge in Prague, which is home to 30 statues and <b>statuaries,</b> mostly baroque, dating to around 1700.|$|R
50|$|Two large <b>statuaries</b> by Daniel Chester French which {{formerly}} {{stood on}} top of the building are now located in Franklin Park. These were preserved during the demolition and were subsequently gifted to the city of Boston.|$|R
50|$|Architecturally {{the temple}} {{contains}} {{a number of}} important buildings in Vietnamese Buddhist art. At the center is a large three-story brick tower named Hoa Phong. Other historical pieces include stone and wooden <b>statuaries,</b> a number of which predates the 10th century.|$|R
5|$|Morton is memorialized in the United States Capitol {{as one of}} Indiana's two statues in the National <b>Statuary</b> Hall Collection. A {{statue of}} Governor Morton serves as the Indiana State Memorial at Vicksburg National Military Park in Vicksburg, Mississippi, {{in honor of his}} role as a {{powerful}} wartime governor.|$|E
5|$|Naval Aviation Monument Park was {{formally}} dedicated on May 6, 2006, by the Hampton Roads Squadron of the Naval Aviation Foundation Association. Planned since 1997 {{in partnership with}} the City of Virginia Beach, the park features heroic-scale <b>statuary</b> and reliefs to tell the history of Naval Aviation.|$|E
5|$|Neoclassicism was {{pioneered by}} Gavin Hamilton and his proteges, the {{brothers}} John and Alexander Runciman, and David Allan. Alexander Runciman pioneered historical painting and Alan helped develop genre art, {{both of which}} would be taken up by Scottish artists in the next century. After the Acts of Union in 1707 there was very little patronage for large and expensive works of art in Scotland. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public <b>statuary</b> and the portrait bust also became popular. Commissions of new <b>statuary</b> tended to be made in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. From the late eighteenth century there are a handful of examples of work from Scottish artists.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is a {{beautiful}} face," [...] said Mrs. Pryor, interrupting a brief pause which had followed half an hour's animated conversation. [...] "The features may be termed perfect; no <b>statuary's</b> chisel could improve them. It is a portrait from the life, I presume?" ...|$|R
50|$|Among {{the most}} notable sculptures, one can find the <b>statuaries</b> of St. Luthgard, the Holy Crucifix and Calvary, and John of Nepomuk. Well known also is the statue of the knight Bruncvík, {{although}} it was erected some 200 years later and {{does not belong to}} the main avenue.|$|R
5000|$|Sunway Pyramid is a {{shopping}} centre opened in July 1997 as Malaysia's first themed shopping and entertainment mall. One of the mall's most easily recognised designs is the Egyptian-inspired Pyramid with a lion [...] "standing guard" [...] at the entrance. The {{rest of the}} building is embellished in the monumental style, complete with pseudo-hieroglyphics decorating facades, along with numerous Pharonic <b>statuaries.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{influence}} of the Liao dynasty on subsequent culture includes a large legacy of <b>statuary</b> art works, with important surviving examples in painted wood, metal, and three-color glazed sancai ceramics. The music and songs of the Liao dynasty are also known to have indirectly or directly influenced Mongol, Jurchen, and Chinese musical traditions.|$|E
5|$|As former President and Mrs. Bush {{began their}} journey to their Texas home, the Obamas and Bidens joined several congressional guests for the inaugural luncheon in National <b>Statuary</b> Hall at the U.S.Capitol. Guests {{included}} top Washington lawmakers {{as well as}} former Presidents and Vice Presidents. Commemorating the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial, the red and white china used during the luncheon were replicas of those used in the Lincoln White House.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Roman {{sculpture}} survive abundantly, {{though often}} in damaged or fragmentary condition, including freestanding statues and statuettes in marble, bronze and terracotta, and reliefs from public buildings, temples, and monuments {{such as the}} Ara Pacis, Trajan's Column, and the Arch of Titus. Niches in amphitheatres such as the Colosseum were originally filled with statues, and no formal garden was complete without <b>statuary.</b>|$|E

60|$|Such was Hendrick Hudson, of whom we {{have heard}} so much, and know so little; and I have been thus {{particular}} in his description, {{for the benefit of}} modern painters and <b>statuaries,</b> that they may represent him as he was; and not, according to their common custom with modern heroes, make him look like a Cæsar, or Marcus Aurelius, or the Apollo of Belvidere.|$|R
50|$|The {{avenue of}} 30 mostly baroque statues and <b>statuaries</b> {{situated}} on the balustrade forms a unique connection of artistic styles with the underlying gothic bridge. Most sculptures were erected between 1683 and 1714. They depict various saints and patron saints venerated at that time. The most prominent Bohemian sculptors of the time took part in decorating the bridge, such as Matthias Braun, Jan Brokoff, and his sons Michael Joseph and Ferdinand Maxmilian.|$|R
5|$|Great Malvern is the {{location}} of the headquarters of Malvern Town Council, the Malvern Hills Conservators and Malvern Hills AONB Partnership, and Malvern Hills District Council. It has many of the town's amenities including the Malvern Theatres complex, the Priory Park, the Splash leisure and swimming complex, the main library, the police station, the tourist information centre, and the museum. In the heart of the town is a statue of the composer Edward Elgar, while other <b>statuary</b> is dedicated to Malvern water.|$|E
5|$|Over these centuries, {{the city}} {{suffered}} numerous assaults. In the 13th century, Mongol forces destroyed a nine-story wooden pagoda at Hwangnyongsa. During the Japanese invasions of Korea, the Gyeongju area became a heated battlefield, and Japanese forces burned the wooden structures at Bulguksa. Not all damage {{was due to}} invasions, however. In the early Joseon period, {{a great deal of}} damage was done to Buddhist sculptures on Namsan by Neo-Confucian radicals, who hacked arms and heads off <b>statuary.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} nipple {{piercing}}, navel piercing, and genital piercing {{has been particularly}} misrepresented by printed works continuing to repeat myths that were originally promulgated by Malloy in the pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief. For example, according to Malloy's colleague Jim Ward, Malloy claimed navel piercing was popular among ancient Egyptian aristocrats and was depicted in Egyptian <b>statuary,</b> a claim that is widely repeated. Other sources say there are no records to support a historical practice for navel piercing.|$|E
40|$|TV-holography {{can hold}} a great {{potential}} in non-destructive diagnostics {{of the state of}} conservation and preservation of artworks. Its use in revealing debonds, cracks, voids, delaminations or residual stress in both ancient paintings on wooden panels, <b>statuaries</b> and mural supports has been proven. The method is easy to apply and very functional for the basic objectives of conservation; its compactness enables detection of microdisplacements even in non laboratory environments. Measurements in field of microcracks and subsurface detachments on ancient frescoes and panel paintings are reported...|$|R
50|$|Matthias Braun is {{probably}} the most famous for his collection of the allegories of Virtues and Vices situated at the Kuks Hospital in Bohemia, a commission of count František Antonín Špork. Other notable sculptures include: the Bethlehem - monumental statues chiselled directly in sandstone rocks near Kuks, forty pitoresque statues of dwarfs at the Kuks race-course, several <b>statuaries</b> at Charles Bridge in Prague, statues in the St. Kliment's church (Prague), the stone pillar of the Holy Trinity in Teplice, the sculptures in the interior of Czernin palace (Prague), and many others.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} 621 m long and nearly 10 m wide, {{following}} {{the example of}} the Stone Bridge in Regensburg, it was built as a bow bridge with 16 arches shielded by ice guards. It is protected by three bridge towers, two of them on the Lesser Quarter side and the third one on the Old Town side. The Old Town Bridge Tower is often considered {{to be one of the}} most astonishing civil gothic-style buildings in the world. The bridge is decorated by a continuous alley of 30 statues and <b>statuaries,</b> most of them baroque-style, originally erected around 1700 but now all replaced by replicas.|$|R
5|$|The walled {{garden to}} the {{north-east}} {{was built in}} 1708 by Alexander McGill, to designs by the Earl of Mar, who also designed the gate piers and garden buildings, and supplied <b>statuary.</b> The garden may have been balanced by a similar walled garden to the south-east of the house. No trace is now visible, but a second garden is shown on 18th century maps of the area, {{and would have been}} consistent with Bruce's symmetrical layout.|$|E
5|$|Two of the statues, both in Arkansas, are {{individually}} {{listed on}} the National Register of Historic Places; one in Helena and one in Fort Smith. Installed in cemeteries, town squares, and parks, outside museums, on courthouse lawns, and countless other places, the design {{is said to be}} the most-viewed example of outdoor <b>statuary</b> in the U.S. (after the Statue of Liberty) although many people do not even realize they have seen it.|$|E
5|$|While these {{characteristics}} never occur all {{together in the}} same building, and none are unique to Sicilian Baroque, it is the coupling together which gives the Sicilian Baroque its distinctive air. Other Baroque characteristics, such as broken pediments over windows, the extravagant use of <b>statuary,</b> and curved topped windows and doors are all emblematic of Baroque architecture, but can all be found on Baroque building all over Europe.|$|E
6000|$|They {{all left}} the house, and all joined the throng of villagers {{collected}} round the grave, where the <b>statuary's</b> man {{was waiting for}} us. In a breathless silence, the first sharp stroke of the steel sounded on the marble. Not a voice was heard--not a soul moved, till those three words, [...] "Laura, Lady Glyde," [...] had vanished from sight. Then {{there was a great}} heave of relief among the crowd, as if they felt that the last fetters of the conspiracy had been struck off Laura herself, and the assembly slowly withdrew. It was late in the day before the whole inscription was erased. One line only was afterwards engraved in its place: [...] "Anne Catherick, July 25th, 1850." ...|$|R
5000|$|Victory Park {{was officially}} opened on July 7, 1946 and covered only the 1/7 of the present-day territory. During the next decade, the park grew {{to the present}} boundaries. The {{original}} quarries, trenches, and foxholes were preserved and further developed into a system of channels and small ponds. The 1950s saw construction projects in the park led by Soviet architects Evgeniy Katonin and Valerian Kirhoglani. They created a summerstage, fountains and several pavilions including two propylaea-like buildings at the main entrance. In further years, sculptures and monuments were installed throughout the park. A major alley called [...] "Alley of Heroes" [...] features busts of Soviet heroes, hence the name. Among <b>statuaries</b> in the park are the monument dedicated to Soviet marshal Georgy Zhukov and statues of Soviet war heroes Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya and Alexander Matrosov. In the 1990s, the Orthodox chapel and commemorative plaque were erected at the former site of the crematory facility.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fine architecture, trowth, I needs must say't o't, [...] The Lord be thankit that we've tint {{the gate}} o't! [...] Gaunt, ghastly, ghaist-alluring edifices, [...] Hanging with threat'ning jut, like precipices; [...] O'er-arching, mouldy, gloom-inspiring coves, [...] Supporting roofs, fantastic, stony groves; [...] Windows and doors in nameless sculptures drest [...] With order, symmetry, or taste unblest; [...] Forms like some bedlam <b>Statuary's</b> dream, [...] The craz'd creations of misguided whim; [...] Forms might be worshipp'd on the bended knee, [...] And still the second dread command be free; [...] Their {{likeness}} is not found on earth, in air, or sea!

5|$|Architecturally, the {{elements}} {{characteristic of the}} style include: the ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are devatas (or apsaras), bas-reliefs, and on pediments extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The <b>statuary</b> of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including gilded stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.|$|E
5|$|During the Nara period, from 710 to 794, the {{government}} established and supported workshops called zōbussho, {{the most prominent}} of which was located in the capital Nara at Tōdai-ji, which produced Buddhist <b>statuary.</b> Clay, lacquer and wood, in addition to bronze, were used. Stylistically, the sculptures were influenced by the high Tang style, showing fuller body modelling, more natural drapery and a greater sense of movement. Representative examples of Nara period sculpture include the Great Buddha and the Four Heavenly Kings at Tōdai-ji, or the Eight Legions at Kōfuku-ji.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 the Art Association {{campaigned for}} a major retrospective, the Augustus Saint-Gaudens Memorial Exhibition, {{to be brought to}} Indianapolis. The exhibition, also {{referred}} to as the Saint-Gaudens Memorial Exhibition of <b>Statuary,</b> attracted 56,000 visitors during its three-month run, well beyond the board's goal of attracting 50,000 visitors. A 1937 exhibition, Dutch Paintings of the Seventeenth Century, included loans from the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. The six-week exhibition presented 65 pieces, including several Rembrandts, and was considered the beginning of the museum's rise to connoisseurship.|$|E
60|$|By {{this example}} the critics have {{concluded}} {{that it is not}} necessary the manners of the hero should be virtuous (they are poetically good if they are of a piece); though where a character of perfect virtue is set before us, it is more lovely; for there the whole hero is to be imitated. This is the AEneas of our author; this is that idea of perfection in an epic poem which painters and <b>statuaries</b> have only in their minds, and which no hands are able to express. These are the beauties of a God in a human body. When the picture of Achilles is drawn in tragedy, he is taken with those warts and moles and hard features by those who represent him on the stage, or he is no more Achilles; for his creator, Homer, has so described him. Yet even thus he appears a perfect hero, though an imperfect character of virtue. Horace paints him after Homer, and delivers him to be copied on the stage with all those imperfections. Therefore they are either not faults in an heroic poem, or faults common to the drama.|$|R
6000|$|Even {{with the}} most selfish disposition, the Vanity Fairian, as he {{witnesses}} this sordid part of the obsequies of a departed friend, can't but feel some sympathies and regret. My Lord Dives's remains are in the family vault: the <b>statuaries</b> are cutting an inscription veraciously commemorating his virtues, and the sorrows of his heir, who is disposing of his goods. What guest at Dives's table can pass the familiar house without a sigh?--the familiar house of which the lights used to shine so cheerfully at seven o'clock, of which the hall-doors opened so readily, of which the obsequious servants, as you passed up the comfortable stair, sounded your name from landing to landing, until it reached the apartment where jolly old Dives welcomed his friends! What {{a number of them}} he had; and what a noble way of entertaining them. How witty people used to be here who were morose when they got out of the door; and how courteous and friendly men who slandered and hated each other everywhere else! He was pompous, but with such a cook what would one not swallow? he was rather dull, perhaps, but would not such wine make any conversation pleasant? We must get some of his Burgundy at any price, the mourners cry at his club. [...] "I got this box at old Dives's sale," [...] Pincher says, handing it round, [...] "one of Louis XV's mistresses--pretty thing, is it not?--sweet miniature," [...] and they talk {{of the way in which}} young Dives is dissipating his fortune.|$|R
60|$|Now these heathens, to {{whom the}} apostles preached, before they heard the gospel, knew that word grace very well indeed, often used it; and saw it written up in their heathen temples all about them. And they meant by it just what we mean, when we talk of a graceful person, or a graceful tree or flower; and what we mean, too, when we say that any one is gracious; that they do things gracefully, {{and have a great}} deal of grace in their way of {{speaking}} and behaving. We mean by that that they are handsome, agreeable, amiable, pleasant to look at, and talk to, and deal with. And so these heathens meant, before they were Christians. The Romans used to talk about some one called a Grace. The Greeks called her CHARIS; which is exactly the word which St John and St Paul use, and from it come our words charity and charitable. But more; they used to talk of three Graces: they fancied that they were goddesses--spirits of some kind in the shape of beautiful, and amiable, and innocent maidens, who took delight in going about the world and making people happy and amiable like themselves; and they used to make images of these graces, and pray to them to make them lovely, and happy, and agreeable. And painters and <b>statuaries,</b> too, used to pray to these graces, and ask them to put beautiful fancies into their minds, that they might be able to paint beautiful pictures, and carve beautiful statues. So when St Paul or St John talked to these heathens about grace, or Charis (as the Testament calls it), they knew quite well what the apostles meant.|$|R
