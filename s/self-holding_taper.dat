50|$|B5 Technical Committee No. 3 on the Standardization of Machine Tapers was {{appointed}} in August, 1926,and held its organization meeting in September, 1926, in New Haven, Conn. Three American tapers then in use, the Brown & Sharpe(1860), Morse (1862), and Jarno (1889), and the taper series adopted by William Sellers & Co.(1862) were combined into a compromise standard series which contained twenty-two (22) <b>self-holding</b> <b>taper</b> sizes.|$|E
50|$|For light loads (such as {{encountered}} by a lathe tailstock or a drill press), tools with <b>self-holding</b> <b>tapers</b> are simply slipped onto {{or into the}} spindle; {{the pressure of the}} spindle against the workpiece drives the tapered shank tightly into the tapered hole. The friction across the entire surface area of the interface provides a large amount of torque transmission, so that splines or keys are not required.|$|R
50|$|Machine tapers can {{be grouped}} into self-holding and self-releasing classes. With <b>self-holding</b> <b>tapers,</b> {{the male and}} female wedge {{together}} and bind to each other {{to the extent that the}} forces of drilling can be resisted without a drawbar, and the tool will stay in the spindle when idle. It is driven out with a wedge when a tool change is needed. Morse and Jacobs tapers are an example of the self-holding variety. With self-releasing tapers, the male will not stick in the female without a drawbar holding it there. However, with good drawbar force, it is very solidly immobile. NMTB/CAT and HSK are examples of the self-releasing variety.|$|R
