5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If you saw her in the street, you'd think: <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a girl who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E
5|$|Mercer {{travels to}} a bohemian pottery-making commune in Shelter Cove, California where Arlen once lived, but learns that {{he moved to}} Reno, Nevada. He passes through Fallon, Nevada {{to meet up with}} the seductive Joely (Jena Malone), his middle school crush. In Reno, they take ecstasy and almost have sex before Mercer resumes his search for Arlen. Later he finds himself on the set of a pornographic film, where the {{director}} (Julio Oscar Mechoso) tells him that Arlen left to work at a pet store in Sacramento, California. Joely asks Mercer if he can drive her cousin Buddy (Colin Fickes) and his friend Rid (William Lee Scott) to Mojave, California, where they are building their own car. While driving, Mercer finds Kate's YMCA card in the trunk of her car and, now knowing what <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> describes a dream to her in which he, Joely, and Kate are dancing in a re-enactment of Bande à parts dance sequence. Not wanting to get sidetracked, he tries to leave the others behind in a motel room, but when Buddy threatens to steal the car, Mercer tells him that the car belongs to his girlfriend, and Buddy, Rid, and Joely leave without Mercer in Kate's car. He hitchhikes to Mojave and finds the salvage yard where Buddy and Rid are working, and retrieves the car.|$|E

25|$|Faustine: One {{could say}} she is the most {{ambiguous}} character in the novel or that the fugitive misjudged her the most. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a Gypsy, speaks French like a South American and likes to talk about Canada. She is inspired by silent film star Louise Brooks.|$|E
25|$|When Gaston returns, he is {{surprised}} and discomfited when Gigi appears in her new, adult dress. Gaston stammers out that <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a giraffe {{and that he}} misses her old outfits. He storms out, realises his folly, and rushes back to apologize. He tells her that she looks lovely, and says that he will prove it to her by taking her to tea at the Reservoir. Gigi's grandmother refuses and tells Gaston that this may ruin her reputation to be seen unchaperoned with Gaston before her reputation has even begun. Gaston, angered, storms out once again.|$|E
500|$|Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "a breathless new biography" [...] by Herbert. In a review in the Herald Sun, Blanche Clark was critical and said, [...] "Herbert's loose timeline is irritating, as is some of her glib commentary, such as: 'When her parents took her out to restaurants, she would use the breadsticks as drum batons—music was clearly in the blood.'" [...] St. Petersburg Times book critic Colette Bancroft said of the images in the book, [...] "I can tell you lots of the photos are fun, although a few are a little scary, {{like the one in}} which <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a space alien awaiting a gynecological exam." ...|$|E

Mika's mother says that, in fact, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> exactly <b>like</b> Chizuko, but has her own personality.|$|R

500|$|Anna Pickard of The Guardian took a {{different}} opinion choosing to focus on how Cole appeared to be [...] "making up {{for the lack of}} having Girls Aloud around her by pretending to be all of them at once" [...] and anguish of her own marriage issues. She noted that Cole's various outfits appear to distract people from the lyrics of the song which [...] "seem to be, a thinly veiled reflection on her own marriage compounded by the sad mooning face she keeps pulling. [...] singing a solo song about one's troubled (though reconciled and apparently happy) marriage. Although sometimes she looks cross instead. And quite a lot of the time, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> she's her own evil sexy twin." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{growing up}} in the {{predominantly}} white area of Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, Dixon's father Melvin would take her to the Notting Hill Carnival in London to allow her to experience some of her Jamaican heritage. The music she would hear influenced her tastes, as she commented: [...] "all the dancehall records I saved up to buy – Shabba Ranks, Buju Banton – I heard them at Notting Hill". When asked during an interview who her favourite songwriter was, Dixon replied: [...] "Lauryn Hill. I love Lauryn Hill because she is not scared to talk about real life. She may say things that are slightly controversial but she gets people thinking and gets people talking". Dixon has also named Neneh Cherry as great influence upon her. Cherry, a mixed race singer, inspired her from an early age, with Dixon saying, [...] "I remember seeing Neneh Cherry on the TV when I was little and turning to my mum and saying, 'Mummy, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> me'".|$|E
500|$|The first {{read-through}} of {{the episode}} was held on January 23, 1991, the same night the second season premiered. [...] "The Statue" [...] was filmed {{in front of a}} live audience six days later. A few scenes were changed prior to filming; in an early draft of the script Elaine sat next to George eavesdropping on Jerry and Ray's conversation. She would wear a floppy hat to look inconspicuous and would complain about it, stating that <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> one of the Cowsills, a singing group that was active between the 1960s and 1970s. The same scene initially featured George admitting that he spied on Ray a day earlier, showing Ray pictures of him in a bar. Ray would reply that it was his day off and asks why George is not at work, to which George replies that he should be getting back and leaves. In the original script, Elaine and Rava would argue over who is a better person: Jerry or Ray.|$|E

500|$|On {{the second}} day of the competition, March 7, 1952, Katsura drew Irving Crane for her first match. They made quite a {{contrast}} as Crane was the tallest player at the tourney, while Katsura was described by reporter Curley Grieve of the San Francisco Examiner as [...] "so small and doll-like <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a figurine in her flowing, gold-satin gown." [...] Crane's main discipline was straight pool, at which he won numerous championships, including six world titles. The match was close, but Crane prevailed 50 to 42 in 57 [...] On March 10, Katsura defeated Herb Hardt 50 to 42 in 58 innings. Katsura was significantly behind at one point but counted 15 points in five innings to take the lead. On March 11, she lost to Chamaco, 50 to 35, but the following day Katsura upset Procita 50–43 in 63 innings, with runs of six, five and four. [...] "Spectators exclaimed 'brilliant' and 'sensational' at some of her shots." ...|$|E
500|$|Hudgens {{received}} {{an amount of}} praise from reviewers, emphasizing her transition from being associated with her previous commercial character, Gabriella Montez, multiple times. Reviewers also cited her impressive performance in the film. Even though Connell and Michalka each received their fair amount of enthusiastic press, David Waddington of North Wales Pioneer claims that Hudgens [...] "outshines {{the rest of the}} cast, failing to fit in with the outcast narrative and making the inevitable climactic ending all the more expected." [...] Hudgens was praised with her performance in the film that The Observer critic, Philip French said that <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> the young Thandie Newton and [...] "wisecracks like Dorothy Parker." [...] French then adds that [...] "Bandslam is a witty, touching, cleverly plotted film with excellent music." [...] Eye Weekly reviewer Will Sloan says, [...] "Bandslam is like a teenybopper version of Adventureland, and if its PG limitations keep it from being quite as insightful or funny as that film, it's still a serviceable, surprisingly intelligent bit of tweenertainment." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{the rest}} of the office get into a heated debate over whether actress Hilary Swank can be {{considered}} [...] "hot". Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) leads the group voting she is not hot, claiming <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "monster". Jim temporarily convinces Kevin to switch sides by having him imagine Hilary kissing him, only for Kevin to switch back, saying the debate is whether she is hot, not whether he would have sex with her. Angela (Angela Kinsey) resists the debate, but eventually votes [...] "hot" [...] after getting offended by Kevin's crude remarks. Kelly (Mindy Kaling), who believes herself less attractive than Swank, gets emotional when Toby (Paul Lieberstein) defends his [...] "not hot" [...] vote. Pam (Jenna Fischer) argues they should not let the Kevins of the world decide who is hot, or decide anything at all. Oscar (Oscar Nuñez) gives a detailed overhead presentation about the structure of Swank's facial features, concluding she is [...] "attractive...not hot." [...] An uncharacteristically uplifting Stanley (Leslie David Baker) votes hot, claiming pointing out flaws is no way to live life. At the end of the debate, the sides are still tied until Michael, oblivious of their debate, passes by the pictures on the wall and casually calls her hot.|$|E

500|$|Rob Markman of MTV News {{wrote that}} the choreography is very {{different}} from the Beyoncé's standard dance routines, which feature high-powered steps, swaying hips and [...] "her patented bootylicious shake". He commented, [...] "Instead, Beyoncé settles for ballet-style steps, moving in a leotard and long, flowing cape." [...] Markman added that the video will most likely remain [...] "under the radar" [...] in comparison to the highlights in her high-budgeted reel, which includes clips like [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] (2008) and [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003). He concluded that [...] "much like the song, the visuals for '1+1' shouldn't be measured in terms of size, but rather in emotive presentation and subdued sexiness". A writer for The Huffington Post {{wrote that the}} music video for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] was Beyoncé'ss most iconic visual work, but added that after the premiere of the video for [...] "1+1", [...] "it may now have company". David Malitz of The Washington Post stated that Beyoncé looks like Hurricane Irene at the beginning of the video, but added that <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> [...] "any number of chillwave videos" [...] at the end. A more mixed review was given by OK! magazine, which described the video as cheesy. L Magazines Mike Conklin was unsatisfied with the video, writing that since Beyoncé is rightfully considered to be among [...] "the absolute best [...] ", she can do better." ...|$|E

In 1978, when she was 12-years-old, Shields played a child prostitute in the controversial film Pretty Baby. Eileen Ford, founder of the Ford Modeling Agency, said of Brooke Shields: [...] "She is a professional child and unique. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> an adult and thinks like one." ...|$|E
