For example, a <b>special</b> <b>crane</b> was rented from Belgium to lower pieces of the CMS detector into its underground cavern, since each piece weighed nearly 2,000 tons. The first of the approximately 5,000 magnets necessary for construction was lowered down a special shaft at 13:00 GMT on 7 March 2005.|$|E

Once the front bogies were at the crossover {{at the top of}} the T they were then jacked up and turned with the subframe 90° and then lowered onto the crosstroke of the T. The gun was then traversed by an electric motor to the bogies and it was clamped to the track once laid onto the target. It fired HE shells weighing 107.5 kg.|$|E

50|$|The {{sculpture}} is 13.75 meters tall (14.25 {{including the}} base). It has {{the appearance of}} two opposing sinusoidal projections. At its base there is a circular containment wall made of stones 75 cm high, containing a stretch of water in which the monument is reflected. The water at the base is 10 cm deep, and its bottom is decorated with a squared motif. The base has been modified to let people sit beneath the statue, and look over the surroundings from a central point of view. The statue has a total weight of 11,000 kg (12.125 tons). It could not be transported by land because of its size, {{and so it was}} transported across the lake with barges, and installed on the pier with a <b>special</b> <b>crane.</b>|$|E
50|$|Once {{the panel}} track is laid, a work train (pulled by diesel locomotives) {{can bring in}} the {{sections}} of continuous welded rail {{that will be used}} for the permanent way of this first track. The rail comes from the factory in lengths varying from 200 m (660 ft) to 400 m (1310 ft). Such long pieces of rail are just laid across several flatcars; they are very flexible, so this does not pose a problem. A <b>special</b> <b>crane</b> unloads the rail sections and places them {{on each side of the}} temporary track, approximately 3.5 m (12 ft) apart. This operation is usually carried out at night, for thermal reasons. The rail itself is standard UIC section, 60 kg/m (40 lb/ft), with a tensile strength of 800 newtons per square millimetre or megapascals (116,000 psi).|$|E

His strength, reflexes and endurance have all been enhanced by his armor and he can fly at sub-sonic speeds. The suit is also air conditioned to prevent discomfort for the operator. The Firepower armor contains a vast array of sensors and an impressive array of weapons including four back-mounted surface-to-air missiles (and additional missiles mounted on leg hardpoints), chest-mounted heat beam lasers, mini-grenades and arm-mounted concussive cannons. The armor can also fire a small tactical nuclear missile known as Terminax from a back-mounted launch tube.

Two tilting lift beams for the installation or removal of steel jackets, up to 22,500 t in weight, will be located at the vessel’s stern. A 5000 t <b>special</b> purpose <b>crane</b> is available for additional lifts for jacket and topsides installation such as pile handling and bridge installation.|$|R

500|$|York was {{disabled}} at Suda Bay in Crete by two Italian explosive motorboats of the Italian Regia Marina assault Flotilla Decima Flottiglia MAS, {{launched by}} the destroyers Crispi and Sella on 26 March 1941; the two old destroyers were fitted with <b>special</b> <b>cranes</b> to operate assault craft. Six motorboats entered the bay, led by Tenente di vascello Luigi Faggioni, and attacked three targets in pairs; the first was York, second the tanker Pericles and last another ship at anchor. Three of the attacking boats had various problems, either mechanical or human, due to the extreme temperature conditions, but the other three successfully attacked their targets. Two motorboats, packed with [...] charges in the bows, struck York amidships, flooding both boiler rooms and one engine room. Two British seamen were killed. All Italian sailors survived the attack and fell into British hands. The ship was run aground to prevent her from sinking. The submarine [...] was used to supply electrical power to operate the cruiser's guns for anti-aircraft defence, until Rover was severely damaged by air attack {{and had to be}} towed away for repairs. On 18 May, further damage was inflicted by German bombers and the ship was damaged beyond repair. Her main guns were wrecked by demolition charges on 22 May 1941 when the Allies began to evacuate Crete. Yorks wreck was salvaged in February 1952 and towed to Bari to be broken up, beginning on 3 March.|$|R

Minister of Defense Moshe Dayan came to bid them farewell, along with Chief of Staff Chaim Bar-Lev and Ezer Weizman, who exuded distress and concern. Vilnai recalls that they made him feel as if his force were departing on a one-way trip. Dinner was eaten in silence, [...] "like the last meal of those sentenced to death," [...] in Vilnai's words. Three hours had been allocated for the round-trip flight and another ninety minutes for the operation itself. Where Operation Iron, the destruction of the Jordanian bridges, had been executed using [...] "sprinkler" [...] bombs flown under the bellies of the Bell 205s and operated by paratroopers, the 500-kilogram bombs would be treated differently in Operation Shock. They would be packed into the helicopters and lowered by a <b>special</b> <b>crane</b> operated by the flight mechanic as the helicopter hovered over the target.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In China, the {{high-speed}} railway construction is growing rapidly currently. As laying {{the high-speed}} railways ’ track plates accurately {{is an important}} part of construction, a large number of multifunctional advanced special cranes are required in order to complete the construction task on time. In the paper, the advanced design and application of the new type large cantilever <b>special</b> <b>crane,</b> which being used in the high-speed railway track plate constructions of Jinghu railway, Huning railway and Guangshengang railway, is introduced. The special main characteristics of the new type multifunctional large cantilever are described, such as easy to be assembled, easy to change the span, the cantilever beams can being folded, can being used in the tunnel, and so on. The successful applications of the new type crane have solved a number of difficulties in the track plate constructions, and have obtained obvious economic returns and social returns...|$|E

The damage to the bridge was estimated as between $15 and $20 million. It was scrapped in its entirety.

5000|$|Ballard {{is also an}} innovator, {{inventing a}} <b>special</b> camera <b>crane</b> for filming inside {{operating}} rooms {{as part of his}} 30 years of work with Medtronic, filming surgeries used to educate individuals in the medical profession. The crane he developed allows surgeons to teach as they are operating on the patient without the filming process obstructing the view or surgical work in any way. In the early 1980s, Ballard also helped design, build and manufacture The Barber Baby Boom, a 100% mechanical jib arm that was {{the first of its kind}} in the industry. Additionally, Ballard designed a movable jib base specifically to address the challenges of filming on construction locations for ABC's [...] "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition." [...] Engineered with special tires so the jib base can be moved from location to location and he later went on to develop a motorized version of the jib base to make set-up and movement even easier that has been used in recent seasons of the program.|$|R
40|$|Gigantic disc of CMS {{detector}} travels 100 m {{under the}} Earth It's an amazing engineering challenge - the lowering {{of the first}} tremendous endcap disc, known as YE+ 3, of the CMS particle detector slowly and carefully 100 m underground into the experimental cavern. The disc is one of 15 large pieces to make the grand descent. It's a uniquely shaped slice, 16 m high, about 50 cm thick and weighing 400 tonnes. The solid steel structure of the disc forms part of the magnet return yoke and is equipped {{on both sides with}} muon chambers. A <b>special</b> gantry <b>crane</b> will lower the element, with just 20 cm of leeway between the edges of the detector and the walls of the shaft. CMS is one of the four main experiments that will take data at the world's highest energy particle accelerator, CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC is a 27 km circular ring 100 m underground. The CMS detector weighs a total of 12 500 tonnes and is constructed on the surface.
