25|$|Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas is a {{rapid and}} {{effective}} <b>sterilant</b> for use against {{a wide range}} of microorganisms, including common bacteria, viruses, and spores. The unique physical properties of NO2 gas allow for <b>sterilant</b> dispersion in an enclosed environment at room temperature and ambient pressure. The mechanism for lethality is the degradation of DNA in the spore core through nitration of the phosphate backbone, which kills the exposed organism as it absorbs NO2. This degradation occurs at even very low concentrations of the gas. NO2 has a boiling point of 21°C at sea level, which results in a relatively high saturated vapour pressure at ambient temperature. Because of this, liquid NO2 may be used as a convenient source for the <b>sterilant</b> gas. Liquid NO2 is often referred to by the name of its dimer, dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). Additionally, the low levels of concentration required, coupled with the high vapour pressure, assures that no condensation occurs on the devices being sterilized. This means that no aeration of the devices is required immediately following the sterilization cycle. NO2 is also less corrosive than other <b>sterilant</b> gases, and is compatible with most medical materials and adhesives.|$|E
25|$|The most-resistant {{organism}} (MRO) to sterilization with NO2 gas is the spore of Geobacillus stearothermophilus, {{which is}} the same MRO for both steam and hydrogen peroxide sterilization processes. The spore form of G. stearothermophilus has been well characterized over the years as a biological indicator in sterilization applications. Microbial inactivation of G. stearothermophilus with NO2 gas proceeds rapidly in a log-linear fashion, as is typical of other sterilization processes. Noxilizer, Inc. has commercialized this technology to offer contract sterilization services for medical devices at its Baltimore, Maryland (U.S.) facility. This has been demonstrated in Noxilizer’s lab in multiple studies and is supported by published reports from other labs. These same properties also allow for quicker removal of the <b>sterilant</b> and residuals through aeration of the enclosed environment. The combination of rapid lethality and easy removal of the gas allows for shorter overall cycle times during the sterilization (or decontamination) process and a lower level of <b>sterilant</b> residuals than are found with other sterilization methods.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Studies on the {{effectiveness}} of various <b>sterilants</b> and culture conditions on in-vitro seed germination in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cv. PKM- 1 revealed that among three <b>sterilants</b> used, surface sterilization of seeds with 5 % NaOCl for 20 minutes was found to be more effective resulting in high germination rate and contamination free cultures. Similarly among the different media and culture conditions considered in the present experiment, MS medium without sucrose with dark incubation for three days recorded lower no. of days (3. 3 days) for initiation of germination with 96 % germination. These findings could be well exploited for further development of quick regenerative and transformation protocols for the tomato cv. PKM- 1.

25|$|Hydrogen peroxide, in both {{liquid and}} as vaporized {{hydrogen}} peroxide (VHP), is another chemical sterilizing agent. Hydrogen peroxide is strong oxidant, which {{allows it to}} destroy {{a wide range of}} pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is used to sterilize heat or temperature sensitive articles such as rigid endoscopes. In medical sterilization hydrogen peroxide is used at higher concentrations, ranging from around 35% up to 90%. The biggest advantage of hydrogen peroxide as a <b>sterilant</b> is the short cycle time. Whereas the cycle time for ethylene oxide may be 10 to 15 hours, some modern hydrogen peroxide sterilizers have a cycle time as short as 28 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Chemicals {{are also}} used for sterilization. Heating {{provides}} a reliable way to rid objects of all transmissible agents, {{but it is not}} always appropriate if it will damage heat-sensitive materials such as biological materials, fiber optics, electronics, and many plastics. In these situations chemicals, either as gases or in liquid form, can be used as sterilants. While the use of gas and liquid chemical sterilants avoids the problem of heat damage, users must ensure that article to be sterilized is chemically compatible with the <b>sterilant</b> being used. In addition, the use of chemical sterilants poses new challenges for workplace safety, as the properties that make chemicals effective sterilants usually make them harmful to humans.|$|E
2500|$|Ozone {{offers many}} {{advantages}} as a <b>sterilant</b> gas; ozone {{is a very}} efficient <b>sterilant</b> because of its strong oxidizing properties (E = 2.076 vs SHE) capable of destroying {{a wide range of}} pathogens, including prions without the need for handling hazardous chemicals since the ozone is generated within the sterilizer from medical grade oxygen. The high reactivity of ozone means that waste ozone can be destroyed by passing over a simple catalyst that reverts it to oxygen and ensures that the cycle time is relatively short. The disadvantage of using ozone is that the gas is very reactive and very hazardous. The NIOSH immediately dangerous to life and health limit for ozone is [...] smaller than the [...] IDLH for ethylene oxide. Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH): NIOSH Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values (as of 3/1/95) and OSHA has set the PEL for ozone at [...] calculated as an [...] time weighted average (29 CFR 1910.1000, Table Z-1). The Canadian Center for Occupation Health and Safety provides an excellent summary of the health effects of exposure to ozone. The <b>sterilant</b> gas manufacturers include many safety features in their products but prudent practice is to provide continuous monitoring to below the OSHA PEL to provide a rapid warning {{in the event of a}} leak. Monitors for determining workplace exposure to ozone are commercially available.|$|E

40|$|Patients {{receiving}} hemodialysis therapy {{risk exposure}} to 'both disinfectants and <b>sterilants.</b> Dialysis equipment is disinfected periodically with strong solutions of hypochlorite or formaldehyde. More recently, reuse of dialyzers has introduced {{the use of}} additional <b>sterilants,</b> such as hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid. The use of these <b>sterilants</b> is recognized by the center staffs and the home patient as a potential risk, and residue tests are carried out {{for the presence of}} these <b>sterilants</b> at the ppm level. Gross hemolysis resulting from accidental hypochlorite infusion has led to cardiac arrest, probably as a result of hyperkalemia. Formaldehyde is commonly used in 4 % solutions to sterilize the fluid paths of dialysis controllers and to sterilize dialyzers before reuse. It can react with red cell antigenic surfaces leading to the formation of anti-N antibodies. Such reactions probably do not occur with hypochlorite or chloramines. The major exposure risk is the low concentration of disinfectant found in municipal water used to prepare 450 L dialysate weekly. With thrice-weekly treatment schedules, the quality requirements for water used to make this solution must be met rigorously. Standards for water used in the preparation of dialysate have recently been proposed but not all patients are treated with dialysate meeting such standards. The introduction of <b>sterilants</b> via tap water is insidious and has led to more pervasive consequences. Both chlorine and chloramines, at concentrations found in potable water, are strong oxidants that cause extensive protein denaturation and hemolysis. Oxidation of the Fe 2 " in hemoglobin to Fe 3 " forms methemoglobin, which is incapable of carrying either 02 or CO 2. Chloramine can form not only methemoglobin, but can also denature proteins within the red cell, thus forming aggregates (Heinz bodies). Chloramines also inhibit hexose monophosphate shunt activity, a mechanism that makes the red cell even more susceptible to oxidant damage. These risks can only be minimized through close cooperation between the clinical staffs and the water carrier's technical personnel...|$|R
2500|$|Endospores are {{resistant}} to most agents that would normally kill the vegetative cells they formed from. Unlike persister cells, endospores {{are the result of}} a morphological differentiation process triggered by nutrient limitation (starvation) in the environment; endosporulation is initiated by quorum sensing within the [...] "starving" [...] population. Most disinfectants such as household cleaning products, alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds and detergents have little effect on endospores. However, <b>sterilant</b> alkylating agents (e.g. ethylene oxide), and 10% bleach are effective against endospores. To kill most anthrax spores, standard household bleach (with 10% sodium hypochlorite) must be in contact with the spores for at least several minutes; a very small proportion of spores can survive longer than 10 minutes in such a solution. Higher concentrations of bleach are not more effective, and can cause some types of bacteria to aggregate and thus survive.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>sterilant</b> gases are {{selected}} {{to destroy a}} wide range of biological life forms, any gas which is suitable for sterilization will present a hazard to personnel exposed to it. The NIOSH immediately dangerous to life and health values (IDLH) for the three <b>sterilant</b> gases above are 800 ppm, 75 ppm and 5 ppm for ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide and ozone respectively. For comparison, the IDLH of cyanide gas (hydrogen cyanide) is 50 ppm. Thus exposure to even low levels of <b>sterilant</b> gas should not be treated casually and most facilities {{go to great lengths to}} adequately protect their employees.|$|E
