P.hadriani {{also has a}} pitted cap, and occurs less frequently than P.ravenelii. The widespread species Itajahya galericulata has a roughly <b>spherical</b> <b>cap</b> of several overlapping spongy tissue layers with gleba sandwiched in-between. Phallus rugulosus is tall, thin, pale orange, and tapers towards the smooth cap. The cap is blackish olive in color, while the volva is oval and white. It {{is found in the}} eastern and southern United States and China. P.granulosodenticulatus is a rare Brazilian species with a superficial resemblance to P.ravenelii.

In maturity, the fruit bodies, are up to [...] tall, with a latticed <b>spherical</b> <b>cap</b> (the receptaculum) atop a long yellow or reddish stipe. In general, Old World specimens tend to be yellow, while New World specimens are reddish, although exceptions have been noted in the literature. The receptaculum is typically [...] in diameter and forms a red or orange lattice, or mesh. There are typically between 20 and 100 small pentagonal to hexagonal meshes in the receptaculum; the arms of the mesh have sharp ridges on the outer surface, [...] on the sides, and are flat to weakly ridged on the inner surface. The internal surfaces of the receptaculum are covered with an olive-green spore-bearing gleba, which sometimes seeps through the mesh holes. Like most stinkhorn species, the gleba has a foul odor, comparable to rotten meat, but it is [...] "less-offensive" [...] than most. The smell of fresh, newly exposed gleba has been reported to be sweet, similar to amyl acetate; the foul odor forming only after it has been exposed to air for some time. The stipe is [...] by [...] thick, and is hollow and spongy. The walls of the stipe are made of an inner layer of large tubes and two or three outer layers of small tubes. Specimens may occasionally be found with fused heads on two separate stipes arising from a single volva.|$|E

These cover the tymbals—specialised structures composed of vertical ribs and a tymbal plate, which is buckled to produce the cicada's song. The head is much broader than that of other cicadas, and is broader than the pronotum behind it. The head, antennae and postclypeus are black, with a narrow broken pale brown transverse band across the vertex just behind the ocelli. The eyes are black in young adult cicadas upon emerging, but turn brown with black pseudopupils at the posterior edge of the eye. The ocelli are deep red. The proboscis is [...] in length—very long compared with other Australian cicada species. The thorax is brown, becoming paler in older individuals. The pronotum is rusty brown with black anterior borders, while the mesonotum is a little paler with prominent black markings, with paired cone-shaped spots with bases towards the front on either side of a median stripe; lateral to these spots are a pair of markings resembling a [...] "7" [...] on the right hand side of the mesonotum and its reverse on the left. The abdomen is black between the tymbal covers and red-brown and black more posteriorly. The underparts of the double drummer are red-brown and black, and covered in fine silvery velvety hairs.

40|$|Abstract. The {{coverage}} {{problem on}} the sphere is studied. We consider the sequential covering of identical <b>spherical</b> <b>caps,</b> so {{that none of them}} contains the center of another one. Set of the center points of such caps is said to form a Minkowski set. We give an algorithm of random sequential covering under the condition of Minkowski set. Problems of packing or covering unit sphere with many identical <b>spherical</b> <b>caps</b> are applied to the globular histogenesis models of the biological organisms, to the uniform arrangement of observatories on the earth, to the information theories, and so on. These problems have different features from the similar problems with respect to the plane, {{and many of them are}} unsolved (G. FEJES TÓTH, 1969; L. FEJES TÓTH, 1972). The coverage on the sphere is concerned mainly with the probability of complete coverage of the whole spherical surface. In the field of discrete mathematics, the interest is centered on the probability under the condition that the centers of <b>spherical</b> <b>caps</b> are chosen independently at random on the surface of the sphere (MAEHARA, 1988).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the theoretical modeling and numerical simulation of the probe tip based nanochannel scratching. According to the scratching depth, the probe tip is modeled as a <b>spherical</b> <b>capped</b> conical tip or a <b>spherical</b> <b>capped</b> regular three side pyramid tip {{to calculate the}} normal force needed for the nanochannel scratching. In order to further investigate the impact of scratching speed, scratching depth and scratching direction on the scratching process, the scratching simulation is implemented in LS-DYNA software, and a mesh-less method called smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) {{is used for the}} sample construction. Based on the theoretical and simulated analyses, the increase of the scratching speed, the scratching depth and the face angle will result in an increase in the normal force. At the same scratching depth, the normal forces of the <b>spherical</b> <b>capped</b> regular three side pyramid tip model are different in different scratching directions, which are in agreement with the theoretical calculations in the d 3 and d 4 directions. Moreover, the errors between the theoretical and simulated normal forces increase as the face angle increases...|$|R
40|$|A convincing {{detection}} of primordial non-Gaussianity in the {{cosmic background radiation}} (CMB) is essential to probe the physics of the early universe. Since a single statistical estimator can hardly be suitable to detect the various possible forms of non-Gaussianity, {{it is important to}} employ different statistical indicators to study non-Gaussianity of CMB. This has motivated the proposal of a number statistical tools, including two large-angle indicators based on skewness and kurtosis of <b>spherical</b> <b>caps</b> of CMB sky-sphere. Although suitable to detect fairly large non-Gaussianity they are unable to detect non-Gaussianity within the Planck bounds, and exhibit power spectra with undesirable oscillation pattern. Here we use several thousands simulated CMB maps to examine interrelated problems regarding advances of these spherical patches procedures. We examine whether a change in the choice of the patches could enhance the sensitivity of the procedures well enough to detect large-angle non-Gaussianity within the Planck bounds. To this end, a new statistical procedure with non-overlapping cells is proposed and its capability is established. We also study whether this new procedure is capable to smooth out the undesirable oscillation pattern in the skewness and kurtosis power spectra of the <b>spherical</b> <b>caps</b> procedure. We show that the new procedure solves this problem, making clear this unexpected power spectra pattern does not have a physical origin, but rather presumably arises from the overlapping obtained with the <b>spherical</b> <b>caps</b> approach. Finally, we make a comparative analysis of this new statistical procedure with the <b>spherical</b> <b>caps</b> routine, determine their lower bounds for non-Gaussianity detection, and make apparent their relative strength and sensitivity.

40|$|In {{this work}} we use Monte Carlo {{simulations}} {{to study the}} phase behavior of <b>spherical</b> <b>caps</b> confined between two parallel hard walls separated by a distance H. The particle model consists of a hard sphere of diameter σ cut off by a plane at a height χ, and it is loosely based on mushroom cap-shaped particles whose phase behavior was recently studied experimentally [E. K. Riley and C. M. Liddell, Langmuir, 26, 11648 (2010) ]. The geometry of the particles {{is characterized by the}} reduced height χ^* = χ/σ, such that the model extrapolates between hard spheres for χ^* ← 1 and infinitely thin hard platelets for χ^* 0. Three different particle shapes are investigated: (a) three-quarter height <b>spherical</b> <b>caps</b> (χ^* = 3 / 4), (b) one-half height <b>spherical</b> <b>caps</b> or hemispheres (χ^* = 1 / 2), and (c) one-quarter height <b>spherical</b> <b>caps</b> (χ^* = 1 / 4). These three models are used to rationalize the effect of particle shape, obtained by cutting off spheres at different heights, on the entropy-driven self-assembly of the particles under strong confinements; i. e., for 1 < H/χ < 2. 5. As H is varied, a sequence of crystal structures are observed, including some having similar symmetry as that of the structures observed in confined hard spheres on account of the remaining spherical surface in the particles, but with additional features on account of the particle shapes having intrinsic anisotropy and orientational degrees of freedom. The χ^* = 3 / 4 system is found to exhibit a phase diagram that is most similar to the one obtained experimentally for the confined mushroom cap-shaped colloidal particles under. A qualitative global phase diagram is constructed that helps reveal the interrelations among different phases for all the particle shapes and confinements studied.
