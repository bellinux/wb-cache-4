40|$|During {{the past}} quarter century, the {{globalisation}} of the economy has caused international trade to become remarkably dynamic. Over the same period international trade also experienced fundamental changes : intra-industry trade in manufacturing products has dramatically increased and new markets and competing countries have emerged. Belgium has long been integrated into this global framework, and its economic development and prosperity have been largely based on close trading links with other countries. Its degree of openness is among the highest of the euro area countries, due in particular to intense trade with these countries. Since 1980, Belgium has been relatively successful in maintaining its position in international trade. The trade balance has initially improved and has subsequently remained positive at around 3 p. c. of GDP. Global market shares have remained relatively <b>stable</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> terms. However, using harmonized foreign trade statistics, a more detailed analysis of Belgium’s export volume over the period 1995 - 2002 reveals that Belgium has lost 5. 8 p. c. of its market share, while the three neighbouring countries have on average increased their share by 3. 8 p. c. This negative result can be attributed in part to an unfavourable export product specialisation, in particular the large share of basic chemicals, metal products and textiles in total trade and the under-representation of machinery and data-processing hardware, electronic and telecommunication equipment.

RITS operates on a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) basis and settles payments sourced from the SWIFT, the Austraclear, and the interbank transactions entered directly into RITS. In this paper, we analyse a dataset received from the Reserve Bank of Australia that includes all interbank transactions settled in RITS on an RTGS basis during five consecutive weekdays from 19 February 2007 inclusive, a week of relatively quiescent market conditions. The source, destination, and value of each transaction are known, which allows us to separate overnight loans from other transactions (nonloans) and reconstruct monetary flows between banks for every day in our sample. We conduct a novel analysis of the flow stability and examine the connection between loan and nonloan flows. Our aim is to understand the underlying causal mechanism connecting loan and nonloan flows. We find that the imbalances in the banks' exchange settlement funds resulting from the daily flows of nonloan transactions are almost exactly counterbalanced by the flows of overnight loans. The correlation coefficient between loan and nonloan imbalances is about - 0. 9 on most days. Some flows that persist over two consecutive days can be highly variable, but overall the flows are moderately <b>stable</b> <b>in</b> <b>value.</b> The nonloan network is characterised by a large fraction of persistent flows, whereas {{only half of the}} flows persist over any two consecutive days in the loan network.

40|$|Oil sands mining {{operations}} in northeastern Alberta are rapidly expanding. Upgrading and extracting the bitumen from the sand requires {{large volumes of}} water generating large quantities of oil sands process water/materials (OSPM) which is high in organic content. Some of the major organic components found in OSPM include unrecovered bitumen, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), naphthenic acids (NAs) and humic acids. Concerns of acute and chronic toxicity resulting from OSPM have led to provincial legislation preventing the discharge of OSPM into local water and mandating the reclamation of areas affected by oil sands mining. To date, OSPM is stored on lease in settling basins while the mining companies evaluate reclamation strategies. One of the reclamation strategies {{involves the use of}} wetlands constructed with differing amounts of OSPM and organic amendments such as peat. Currently, numerous wetlands, both natural and constructed, are present on oil sands leases. To determine the sustainability of these wetlands for reclamation, the assimilation and flow of carbon and nitrogen within the systems need to be defined. Stable isotope analysis can enhance this understanding. To effectively use <b>stable</b> isotopes <b>in</b> the field, there is the need to determine the changes <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> isotope <b>values</b> occurring from the microbial degradation of organic components such as NAs which contribute a significant portion to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in reclamation sites. This study examined the microbial degradation of commercial and oil sands derived NAs by oil sands derived microbial cultures. Changes <b>in</b> <b>stable</b> isotopes <b>values</b> <b>in</b> the biomass (δ 13 C, δ 15 N), DOC and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (δ 13 C) arising from degradation of the DOC were tracked in both static and semi-continuous tests. Utilization of commercial and oil sands derived NAs resulted in minimal change of the DOC stable isotope values. The biomass was 13 C enriched for both the commercial (0. 3 to 2. 9 per mil (‰)) and oil sands derived NAs (3. 7 to 8. 5 ‰) relative to the DOC stable isotope values. DIC stable isotope values showed higher variability (- 5 to + 5. 5 ‰). The semi-continuous tests showed biomass that was 15 N enriched (3. 8 to 8. 4 ‰) with the assimilation of ammonium. Isotope trends established in the laboratory study provide further understanding into assimilation of carbon and nitrogen compounds in the field. DOC and DIC concentration and carbon stable isotope values were determined for water sampled from 13 oil sands aquatic reclamation sites varying in age, construction and organic material. Both DOC and DIC concentrations were elevated in OSPM affected sites, by an average of 40 mg/L for DOC and 83 mg/L for DIC concentrations. DOC concentrations were also elevated by approximately 10 mg/L at high organic sites. δ 13 C DOC values were slightly 13 C enriched in young sites: 0. 6 ‰ compared to δ 13 C DOC values at the mature sites. Also, from June to July 13 C enrichment (0. 3 to 1. 9 ‰) of the DOC for all sites was seen. Corresponding with the enrichment seen in the DOC, 13 C depletion (- 8. 8 to - 0. 3 ‰) of the DIC was seen for most sites from June to July. The trends seen from June to July may be a result of the release of readily degradable organics from the spring thaw stimulating the microbial community. The baseline values determined for DOC and DIC may assist future field food web studies...|$|R
