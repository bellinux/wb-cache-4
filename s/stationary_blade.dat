50|$|A {{splitter}} is a <b>stationary</b> <b>blade</b> {{of similar}} thickness to the rotating saw blade mounted behind it {{to prevent a}} board from pinching inward into the saw kerf and binding on the saw blade, potentially causing a dangerous kickback. Like a riving knife, its thickness should be greater than {{the body of the}} saw blade but thinner than its kerf. Blades with a narrow kerf relative to their body are more susceptible to grabbing and kickback.|$|E
50|$|Used {{extensively}} in bookbinding, a board shear is a large, hand-operated machine for cutting board or paper. Like scissors, a board shear uses two blades to apply shear stress exceeding the paper's shear strength {{in order to}} cut. The <b>stationary</b> <b>blade</b> forms {{the edge of the}} cutting table, with the moving blade mounted on a cutting arm. Originally known as a table gauge shear because its gauge allowed the cutting of consistently-sized materials, the board shear resembles a larger version of the paper cutters commonly found in offices.|$|E
50|$|No {{matter what}} the power source, a log {{splitter}} either uses a hydraulic piston to drive the log through a <b>stationary</b> <b>blade</b> or a rotating cone shaped screw mandrel that pulls the log up over a wedge. Some models have attachments that prevent the split logs from falling to the ground allowing the operator to reposition the logs quickly for a second pass on the log splitter. Some cone or screw splitters are mounted on steel platforms mounted on a 3-point linkage that allow the log to be repeatedly split into smaller pieces without putting the wood down and up again.|$|E
5000|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, {{the mean}} free path of air is about 70 nm. A turbomolecular pump can work only if those molecules hit by the moving <b>blades</b> reach the <b>stationary</b> <b>blades</b> before colliding with other molecules on their way. To achieve that, the gap between moving <b>blades</b> and <b>stationary</b> <b>blades</b> must be close to or less than the {{mean free path}}. From a practical construction standpoint, a feasible gap between the blade sets is {{on the order of}} 1 mm, so a turbopump will stall (no net pumping) if exhausted directly to the atmosphere. Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure, a turbopump will pump when the exhaust pressure is less than about [...] where the mean free path is about 0.7 mm.|$|R
50|$|Frictional {{resistance}} is offered during flow of steam through nozzles on moving and <b>stationary</b> <b>blades.</b> In {{most of the}} turbines the blade wheels rotate in a space full of steam. The viscous friction at the wheel surface causes admission losses as steam passes from nozzle to wheel. The effect of partial admission creates eddies in the blade channels.|$|R

5000|$|Velocity {{compound}} [...] "Curtis". Curtis {{combined the}} de Laval and Parsons turbine {{by using a}} set of fixed nozzles on the first stage or stator and then a rank of fixed and rotating blade rows, as in the Parsons or de Laval, typically up to ten compared with up to a hundred stages of a Parsons design. The overall efficiency of a Curtis design is {{less than that of}} either the Parsons or de Laval designs, but it can be satisfactorily operated through a much wider range of speeds, including successful operation at low speeds and at lower pressures, which made it ideal for use in ships' powerplant. In a Curtis arrangement, the entire heat drop in the steam takes place in the initial nozzle row and both the subsequent moving blade rows and <b>stationary</b> <b>blade</b> rows merely change the direction of the steam. Use of a small section of a Curtis arrangement, typically one nozzle section and two or three rows of moving blades, is usually termed a Curtis 'Wheel' and in this form, the Curtis found widespread use at sea as a 'governing stage' on many reaction and impulse turbines and turbine sets. This practice is still commonplace today in marine steam plant.|$|E

This study investigates various scenarios consisting of shutting down the damaged unit for repairs and having continued operation of the unit by removing the low-pressure blades and replacing the <b>stationary</b> <b>blade</b> ring with buffer boards. Based on the simulation results, the numerical model has reflected strong agreement with the critical decisions made to operate the damaged unit continuously in a time of the blade failure...|$|E

Our present interest is with time averaged forces for estimation of shaft loads and flow asymmetry forces rather than with transient processes. For this purpose we have adopted the well-known "actuator" model for the blade row in which the flow leaving the row or cascade is assumed to have a constant leaving angle. The disturbances external to this row such as a volute may be represented by distributions of vortex elements as was done for example by Domm and Hergt [1]...|$|E

Conventional {{high-pressure}} turbine blades (and vanes) {{are made from}} nickel based alloys and often utilise intricate internal air-cooling passages to prevent the metal from overheating. In recent years, experimental ceramic blades have been manufactured and tested in gas turbines, {{with a view to}} increasing rotor inlet temperatures and/or, possibly, eliminating air cooling. Ceramic blades are more brittle than their metallic counterparts, and carry a greater risk of catastrophic blade failure. This has tended to limit their use in jet engines and gas turbines to the stator (<b>stationary)</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|R

It is shown {{that one of the}} most important reasons for existence of running waves is the running periodic forces from steam wakes due to different numbers of <b>blades</b> of <b>stationary</b> and rotating wheels. On a simplified computational model of disk with closed 10 -blades bundle are presented resulting velocities, theirs directions and modes of forced running waves. The effect of these forced running waves on the existence of flutter waves will be shortly mentioned as well...|$|R
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} {{steady and}} unsteady velocity distributions in the {{axial flow fan}} were measured using a hot wire probe for various operational conditions, various rotational speeds and various measuring positions. For measuring the velocity distributions in the blade passage, a specially designed and manufactured hot wire traversing apparatus was used. Steady velocity distributions, turning angles, effects of incident to the cascade, flow leakage through the tip clearance and effects of the flow separation show the flow phenomena through the blade passages. Unsteady velocity distributions show time dependent procedures of the wake flowing through the moving blade passage. Considering these results of measurements, {{the effects of the}} upstream <b>stationary</b> <b>blade</b> and the effects of Reynolds number on the flow were considered...|$|E
40|$|A {{rotating}} three-sensor, hot-wire probe {{has been}} used along with rotor blade static pressure measurements to investigate the complex inviscid and viscid effects in the annulus wall flowfield, including the three components of mean velocity, turbulence intensity, and turbulence stress inside the rotor blade passage. It is found that the tip leakage flow originates near quarter-chord, with peak values occurring near mid-chord. The leakage flow, {{which is in the}} form of a jet within the blade row, is augmented by the blade rotation and travels further away from the suction surface than that observed in <b>stationary</b> <b>blade</b> rows and cascades. This leakage flow tends to roll up between the mid-passage and the pressure surface near the tip region; the vortex formation does not occur within the passage in this particular case...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{technique to}} predict the viscous behavior in the three-dimensional domain of rotating and <b>stationary</b> <b>blade</b> passages is presented. The analysis {{is based upon the}} numerical integration of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. An approach is taken to combine the three momentum equations and the continuity equation into two sets of vorticity transport-stream function equations. These equations are expressed along families of arbitrarily defined orthogonally intersecting surfaces placed within the blade passage. Unlike the stream surfaces, the arbitrary surfaces allow fluid to flow across. The numerical code employs a nonorthogonal body fitted coordinate system on each of the intersecting surfaces. The solution process involves the iterative combination of the solutions on the two families of intersecting surfaces for a complete solution. The results of flow in thin blade stationary and rotating polar ducts is presented...|$|E

In the numerically simulated experiment, the <b>stationary</b> <b>blades</b> are mounted on the casing and the tip clearance is formed between them and the spinning hub. The purpose of the present paper is to scrutinize flow trends identified during the measurements and elucidate the flow patterns in the blade passage for rotating and stationary hub...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} set of unsteady pressure {{data was}} acquired along the midspan {{of a modern}} transonic fan blade for simulated flutter conditions. The data set was acquired in a nine-blade linear cascade with an oscillating middle blade to provide a database for the influence coefficient method to calculate instantaneous blade loadings. The cascade was set for an incidence of 10 dg. The data were acquired on three <b>stationary</b> <b>blades</b> {{on each side of}} the middle blade that was oscillated at an amplitude of 0. 6 dg. The matrix of test conditions covered inlet Mach numbers of 0. 5, 0. 8, and 1. 1 and the oscillation frequencies of 200, 300, 400, and 500 Hz. A simple quasiunsteady two-dimensional computer simulation was developed to aid in the running of the experimental program. For high Mach number subsonic inlet flows the blade pressures exhibit very strong, low-frequency, self-induced oscillations even without forced blade oscillations, while for low subsonic and supersonic inlet Mach numbers the blade pressure unsteadiness is quite low. The amplitude of forced pressure fluctuations on neighboring <b>stationary</b> <b>blades</b> strongly depends on the inlet Mach number and forcing frequency. The flowfield behavior is believed to be governed by strong nonlinear effects due to a combination of viscosity, compressibility, and unsteadiness. Therefore, the validity of the quasi-unsteady simplified computer simulation is limited to conditions when the flowfield is behaving in a linear, steady manner. Finally, an extensive set of unsteady pressure data was acquired to help development and verification of computer codes for blade flutter effects...|$|R

In this problem, the sliding mesh method is used at the interface of rotor and stator. The transfer of information at the sliding interface was done based on a conservative form of a third order interpolation technique. Several testes cases were carried out to examine the problem and obtain the effect of rotor-stator interaction. The results show that for the turbine type stages, the stator-rotor interaction affects mainly the moving blades and also the wake region of the <b>stationary</b> <b>blades.</b> The amount of these effects depends on the velocity of the rotor blades...|$|R

A generic configuration was used in a priori in-house experiment, which provides test data for CFD validation. The two-phase flow CFD model adopts the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, in which the air-flow was treated as the continuous phase and water droplets as the dispersed phase. CFD predictions are found in fairly good agreement with test results, particularly the water coverage on the downstream blade row.

No steam turbine is truly isentropic, however, with typical isentropic efficiencies ranging from 20-90% based on the application of the turbine. The interior of a turbine comprises several sets of blades or buckets. One set of <b>stationary</b> <b>blades</b> is connected to the casing and one set of rotating blades is connected to the shaft.

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to improve the accuracy of an existing computer program used to calculate transonic velocities on a blade-to-blade surface of a turbomachine. The method eliminates problems encountered in obtaining solutions with the velocity gradient equation when large gradients in velocity occur through the blade row. With the improved method, {{results indicate that the}} transonic solution can be obtained by scaling the velocities obtained at the reduced mass flow rate where all velocities are subsonic thereby eliminating the need for a solution of the velocity gradient equation. Solutions obtained with the scaling method on a two dimensional compressor cascade and an axial turbine stator show good agreement with experimental data. The results obtained for the <b>stationary</b> <b>blade</b> rows and comparison of analytical results obtained with and without the present method suggest that the method will yield an improved solution for centrifugal compressor impellers...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of the nonsteady Lax-Wendroff technique to problems with asymptotically periodic solution which offers a potentially powerful method for {{the investigation of the}} interaction of rotating and <b>stationary</b> <b>blade</b> rows in turbomachinery is reported. A technique for specifying boundary conditions with phase lag was developed to accomplish this. A complete nonlinear analysis is carried out numerically to determine the entire flow field without recourse to the assumption of small disturbances of linear equations which underlie the previous acoustic theories. The result, obtained for the case of equal number of rotor and stator blades shows that transonic flow can be handled without difficulty. In addition, the program is not limited with regard to blade thickness, camber or loading. Extension of this method to incorporate viscous wakes and to analysis of fully three dimensional configuration is feasible, and would greatly expand its utility in practical applications...|$|E
40|$|American Institute of Aeronautics and AstronauticsA unique vortex {{generator}} that simulates the trailing vortex {{produced by a}} helicopter main rotor in forward flight was used {{in a study of}} main rotor/tail rotor blade vortex interaction. Velocity measurements were performed using hot wire anemometry and particle image velocimetry, which showed the interacting vortices to be three dimensional and to contain a significant core axial flow. Surface pressure measurements during vortex collision with an instrumented, <b>stationary</b> <b>blade</b> were obtained at a variety of incidence settings. At the leading edge, a suction peak occurred where the core flow was directed away from the surface and, similarly, a pressure peak occurred where the core flow was directed toward the surface. This behavior can be explained in terms of the impulsively blocked vortex core axial flow. Also, the leading edge suction and pressure peaks were amplified or attenuated by changing the incidence of the blade. However, the changes in surface pressure distribution were such that the peak normal force was approximately the same for each incidence setting. C. J. Doolan, F. N. Coton and R. A. M.

They are suitable for antarctic use, especially as energy sources for unmanned observation units. An analysis is given of the performance of an axial-flow air-turbine comprising a stator having <b>stationary</b> <b>blades</b> and a rotor having moving blades. Changes in the velocity and thermodynamic properties of the air flow in passing through the turbine are discussed quantitatively, and the expression for the output power and efficiencies of the turbine are given. It is shown that the output attains its maximum when the axial velocity of the air flow in the turbine is 1 /√ of the wind velocity. The method of evaluation of the maximum annual wind energy available is discussed. The design of turbine blades is described: the constant nozzle angle design is adopted for the <b>stationary</b> <b>blades,</b> and the axially leaving velocity design for the moving blades. The starting torque, the starting wind velocity, and the off- design performance of the wind air-turbine are also studied. The performance of an air-turbine with stator is compared theoretically to that of an ordinary wind air-turbine without stator, and it is verified the maximum output power allowable for the former will be about 140 % of the latter at a lower rotational speed than the latter, which will be about 70 % thereof. A wind electric generator designated NU- 101 which has been designed {{on the basis of the}} discussion outlined above is described.

50|$|An {{impulse turbine}} has fixed nozzles that orient the steam flow into high speed jets. These jets contain {{significant}} kinetic energy, which is converted into shaft rotation by the bucket-like shaped rotor blades, as the steam jet changes direction. A pressure drop occurs across only the <b>stationary</b> <b>blades,</b> {{with a net}} increase in steam velocity across the stage.As the steam flows through the nozzle its pressure falls from inlet pressure to the exit pressure (atmospheric pressure, or more usually, the condenser vacuum). Due to this high ratio of expansion of steam, the steam leaves the nozzle with a very high velocity. The steam leaving the moving blades has {{a large portion of}} the maximum velocity of the steam when leaving the nozzle. The loss of energy due to this higher exit velocity is commonly called the carry over velocity or leaving loss.|$|R
