25|$|Existing {{technology}} {{continued to}} present difficulties: in particular, animating hair {{turned out to}} be a challenge. Senior software engineer Kelly Ward spent six years writing programs to make it move the way they wanted. As late as January 2010, the directors were still not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Rapunzel character's length of hair was going to work. These problems were finally solved in March: An improved version of a hair simulation program named Dynamic Wires, originally developed for Bolt, was eventually used. To make hair float believably in water, and to surmount other similar challenges, discrete differential geometry was used to produce the desired effects, freeing the animators from executing these specific tasks directly, which would have taken days instead of minutes.|$|E

25|$|By 2012, the Cázares {{claimed the}} Tamaulipas agency had not {{questioned}} potential suspects or eyewitnesses of the kidnapping, nor had they visited the locations {{relevant to the}} case. The Cázares have insisted that authorities should start by investigating the house they were taken following their kidnapping, given that it is located just {{a block away from}} a busy street in Matamoros. In March 2012, an electricity bill was found {{on the door of the}} premises. The bill showed that the service was used exponentially during the month the family was kidnapped, and that the last time someone paid the bill was on January 2011. A neighbor who lived near the house where the Cázares were held hostage said he did not know who the owners of the property were but did acknowledge seeing suspicious activity during the evenings. On March 7, about 10 months after the mass kidnapping, Gérald Martin, the General Consul of France in Mexico, told the Cázares family that a squadron of Mexico's Federal Police had been dispatched to Matamoros to work directly on the case. The family claims, however, that were not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> investigation was actually carried out. They said they did not receive any documents of the investigation. By October 2012, a criminal court in Jalisco under judge Francisco Martín Hernández Zaragoza was assigned to investigate the case. The family claims they do not know the details of the investigation.|$|E
25|$|On 23 October 1943, Azad Hind {{declared}} war against Britain and the United States. Its first formal commitment {{came with the}} opening of the Japanese offensive towards Manipur, code named U-Go. In the initial plans for invasion of India, Field Marshall Terauschi had been reluctant to confer any responsibilities to the INA beyond espionage and propaganda. Bose rejected this as the role of Fifth-columnists, and insisted that INA should contribute substantially in troops to form a distinct identity of an Indian-liberation army. He secured from Japanese army Chief of Staff, General Sugiyama, the agreement that INA would rank as an allied army in the offensive. The advanced headquarters of Azad Hind was moved to Rangoon in anticipation of success. The INA's own strategy was to avoid set-piece battles, for which it lacked armament as well as manpower. Initially it sought to obtain arms and increase its ranks by inducing British-Indian soldiers to defect. The latter were expected to defect in large numbers. Col Prem Sahgal, once military secretary to Subhas Bose and later tried in the first Red Fort trials, explained the INA strategy to Peter Fay– although the war itself hung in balance and nobody was <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Japanese would win, initiating a popular revolution with grass-roots support within India would ensure that even if Japan ultimately lost the war, Britain would not be in a position to re-assert its colonial authority. It was planned that, once Japanese forces had broken through British defences at Imphal, the INA would cross the hills of North-East India into the Gangetic plain, where it would work as a guerrilla army. This army was expected to live off the land, with captured British supplies,support, and personnel from the local population.|$|E

He did think that a jambonneau of duck was worth praising, describing it as [...] "delicious", but also thought that another dish of monkfish was rubbery in texture. He described the menu itself as [...] "awkwardly written, badly punctuated, and at points quite impenetrable". Following the first Michelin star, David Fingleton visited {{the restaurant}} for The Spectator, and said that the experience was [...] "beyond reproach; unsullied pleasure from start to finish".|$|E

This season sees a big development with a [...] "well-adjusted" [...] Connor and the long-due reconciliation of father and son; Connor is able to accept and appreciate all Angel did for him after his memories return. Minear and Bell were open to and had mentioned the possibility of character's return to Kartheiser {{at the end of}} season four. But following his return, Kartheiser isn't <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> re-appearance was not only due to the necessity of tying up loose ends after the series was reckoned to be canceled. Originally Kartheiser was asked to appear for one episode [...] "Origin" [...] but the crew and Kartheiser enjoyed working with revamped Connor so much that [...] "it became clear to [...] that he had to appear for the series finale".|$|E

500|$|The gradual {{alteration}} of Rick was frequently {{mentioned in the}} critiques.

Halden proclaimed that the progression established a strong sense of direction for the character. [...] "This is a definite direction. I’m not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> show’s going to make Rick an out-and-out monster, or if this is setting up some sort of redemptive arc for him in season three, but it’s a strong choice.

500|$|... "It Came {{from the}} Nightosphere" [...] was written and storyboarded by Adam Muto and Rebecca Sugar, from {{a story by}} Merriwether Williams, Steve Little, Patrick McHale, Pendleton Ward, and Thurop Van Orman. The episode was the first episode storyboarded by Sugar; {{according}} to her, she [...] "did all the monster stuff at the end", whereas Muto [...] "did all the meat in the middle". She later joked that [...] "anything that is actually witty was done by Adam. I’m usually responsible for sex jokes and violence." [...] During the storyboarding process, Sugar and Muto were running low on time, As such, Muto asked fellow series artist Jesse Moynihan if he could help storyboard the initial fight between Marceline and her father. The final scene with Abadeer, which featured Finn cutting open his [...] "soul sack" [...] was added by Sugar based on a drawing by Ward that featured Finn {{flying through the air}} with two swords. However, she was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> scene would make it into the final product due to its graphic nature. A scene that features Marceline's dad confronting Gunter the penguin inspired the writers to pen the fourth season episode [...] "Reign of Gunters".|$|E
500|$|As the character's storyline progressed, {{he became}} [...] "one {{of the most}} devious {{characters}} on daytime" [...] {{as part of a}} Gothic plot in which Adam secretly torments Ashley, Victor's love interest, to get revenge on his father. The story called for Adam to be blind, with uncertainty whether his condition is genuine. Engen told Julie McElwain of Soaps In Depth that he was not sure how to portray the blindness. He said, [...] "I didn't want to nail it on the head completely with the blindness, because I wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> blindness was real. Signy [...] won awards for her portrayal of retinitis pigmentosa, and I {{thought it would be a}} dishonor to that if I came too close to the mark." [...] Engen said that he thought that former executive producers, Maria Arena Bell and Paul Rauch, and the writers [...] "know what they're doing, and right now it would seem like Adam is instigating more...drama."

In September, he first made claims that U2 were working on three separate album projects: a [...] "rocking club album" [...] comprising material the group previously wrote with producer Rick Rubin but shelved; the songs {{that he and the}} Edge had written for Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark; and Songs of Ascent. Bassist Adam Clayton was sceptical about Bono's statements, believing their material to still be in its infancy, while the Edge said he was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Spider-Man songs would be released as a U2 album or a cast recording, adding: [...] "The Spider-Man collection is the most developed but the least appropriate to the band. We've got so much material at different stages of completion, it's going to be a nice problem when we've got a few weeks to look at it." [...] After the band performed at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin in November, Bono and the Edge traveled to the South of France for a two-week songwriting session, followed by a studio session in New York City in December.|$|E
500|$|His first {{appearance}} of 2007–08 {{came as a}} 75th-minute substitute in a 2–0 defeat away to Darlington on 11 August 2007 and following a 2–1 away defeat against Bradford City on 25 August he said [...] "I'm pleased with my form at the moment because I've been working hard to try {{and stay in the}} team and I'm happy that things seem to be going well for me at the moment". Mackin joined Conference Premier club Droylsden on 24 January 2008 on a one-month loan, having made seven appearances for Wrexham by that point in 2007–08. He made his debut two days later in a 1–0 home victory over Kidderminster Harriers and on 31 January 2008 the loan was extended {{until the end of the}} season after earning [...] "rave reviews" [...] for his performances. His only goal for Droylsden came in the 70th minute against Torquay United on 1 April 2008, which was their only goal in a 2–1 home defeat. He made 15 appearances and scored 1 goal for Droylsden before returning to Wrexham after being recalled from the loan in April 2008. The four appearances he made following his return were described as [...] "battling", and the last of these included his first goal for Wrexham in a 4–2 win away to Lincoln City on 3 May 2008, which was Wrexham's final match in the Football League before their relegation to the Conference Premier. He later commented [...] "I got a little touch on it and I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> defender got the final touch but it went straight in and I'm very pleased with it!"

500|$|Dave Golder of SFX {{magazine}} gave [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] {{five out}} of five stars, thinking that Moffat captured [...] "the way children perceive the Doctor" [...] and praising the debuts of Smith and Gillan. The A.V. Club reviewer Keith Phipps gave the episode an A-, explaining that he liked Smith [...] "a lot" [...] but was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Eleventh Doctor was separate enough from the Tenth yet. He called Gillan [...] "instantly winning" [...] and that the story was [...] "no exception" [...] from Moffat's typical [...] "exceptionally strong narratives, keen sense of character, and efficient plotting". Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune stated that the episode [...] "works" [...] as an introduction, though it could be [...] "almost too jokey at times". Though she felt the series was in good hands with Smith and Gillan, she derided the Atraxi for being [...] "alarmingly static and ultimately uninteresting" [...] and the story's [...] "little substance". IGN's Matt Wales rated the episode 8 out of 10, praising it for easily fitting into the show's continuity, especially with Smith's portrayal of the Doctor. However, he thought the [...] "calamity plot" [...] was the [...] "weakest link in an otherwise superb opening episode" [...] and the [...] "whole bunch of disparate elements ... never [...] into a satisfying whole". Though {{he said it was}} not perfect with [...] "a saggy midsection and slightly naff CGI effects", he thought it was still [...] "wondrous in so many ways". New York Times reviewer Mike Hale wrote that the episode worked like [...] "a well-oiled piece of machinery", but it came across as [...] "routine" [...] with [...] "none of the over-the-top exuberance" [...] of Davies' run. While he noted that Gillan [...] "looks promising", he felt that Smith was too much like Tennant and would [...] " [...] to start shaping his own take on the role".|$|E
