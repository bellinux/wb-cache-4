500|$|On Nishino-shima Island in Honshu's Shimane Prefecture, {{precipitation}} {{caused the}} deterioration of surface sediments, resulting in landslides that damaged several buildings. Agricultural damage totaled to ¥660,000 (US$5,500), and three flights were cancelled at Oki Airport. Multiple landslides occurred in Miyagi Prefecture. In Kesennuma, the rains triggered a rockfall, prompting evacuations and damaging a home. A second rockfall incident occurred on June2, destroying several buildings. Residents of Ogachi and Ishinomaki were ordered to evacuate due {{to the threat of}} additional rockfalls and landslides, [...] In both Hino and Kurayoshi, Tottori, heavy rain caused damage to roads and farmland erosion. The precipitation also caused a river to flow over its banks, flooding adjacent land. Damage in Tottori Prefecture amounted to ¥890million (US$75,000). Significant damage occurred in Ōita Prefecture, where heavy rains caused landslides and <b>suspended</b> <b>rail</b> operations. Most of the damage in Ōita Prefecture was done to crops, particularly vegetables, and totaled ¥27.37million (US$230,000). Damage to sweet potato and tobacco crops alone in Kagoshima Prefecture reached ¥21million (US$180,000), while damage to agricultural infrastructure totaled ¥2million (US$16,800). Damage to tobacco crops in Miyazaki Prefecture were estimated even higher at ¥50.57million (US$420,000). In Nagasaki Prefecture, the rains also damaged forests, with damage estimated at ¥23million (US$190,000); other agricultural damage was estimated at ¥60million (US$500,000). Voluntary evacuation procedures took place in Fukue, Nagasaki due to the threat of building collapse.|$|E

50|$|From this date, the Railway {{suffered}} {{a loss of}} trained personnel and operation for a full season {{became more and more}} difficult. In 2013 two directors resigned fearing that the Railway was facing closure. A local businessman took on the tenancy of the cafe and shortly after, operation of the whole business. Reports on the poor condition of the railway track, locos and rolling stock were ignored and eventually brought about the closure of railway operations. There were however no attempts to repair the track, but the tenant removed the first stretch of rail and began operation of a land train. Following an ORR inspection the Teifi Valley Railway <b>suspended</b> <b>rail</b> services in June 2014 and the Company was reprimanded for having passed rail operations to another operator.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The forces {{involved}} in the firing of the electromagnetic rail gun may be analyzed from Amperian, Maxwellian and Einsteinian approaches. This paper discusses these different paradigms with regard to rail gun performance modeling relating to the generation and balance of the forces caused by the currents and their induced magnetic fields. Recent experimental work on model rail guns, where the armature is held static, shows very little recoil upon the rails, thereby indicating a possible violation of Newton’s Third Law of Motion. Dynamic testing to show this violation, {{as suggested by the}} authors in an earlier paper, has inherent technical difficulties. A purpose-built finite element C/C++ simulator that models that <b>suspended</b> <b>rail</b> gun firing action shows a net force acting upon the entire rail gun system. A new effect in physics, universal in scope, is thus indicated: a current circulating in an asymmetric and rigid circuit causes a net force to act upon the circuit {{for the duration of the}} current. This conclusion following from computer simulation based upon Maxwellian electrodynamics as opposed to the more modern relativistic quantum electrodynamics needs to be supported by unambiguous experimental validation...|$|E
30|$|In an {{automobile}} assembly line, many processes require control and human intervention. A human’s dexterity {{and ability to}} react to unpredictable changes in production volume and product specifications are necessary for these processes. Thus, it remains difficult to rely on robots or other automated systems. Conversely, some tasks, such as moving to a tool rack and delivering parts, do not require human skill. In the bumper assembly process of automobile assembly, a worker must move {{to pick up the}} bumper twice in one procedure. This task may strain the worker and increase work time for each bumper. To address this situation, we developed a new co-worker robot, named B-PaDY, to work in cooperation with human workers on the automobile bumper assembly line. This co-worker robot is not directly involved in the assembly processes, but performs tasks to support human workers. The robot delivers the bumper to the worker on the production line at the right time. We propose hardware concepts and designs to ensure worker’s safety and allow for handling of all bumpers types. This robot uses a <b>suspended</b> <b>rail</b> system and handles the bumper, attaching to its reverse side. Additionally, we propose a method to determine the proper delivery timing based on a logistic regression model and confirm its effectiveness by performing experiments. We statistically model the worker’s state upon completion of the assembly task and stochastically determine the proper timing. By recognizing the worker’s behavior and supporting the worker with appropriate timing, our system effectively supplies the bumper to the worker and improves work efficiency.|$|E

50|$|There was {{a project}} to re-open the line in 1964, {{although}} it was strongly resisted by local bus companies. While rail tracks were untouched and the rolling stock stored at warehouses in Trelew, 15 coaches were destroyed by fire, which caused the project to be <b>suspended</b> indefinitely. <b>Rail</b> tracks were finally dismantled between 1969 and 1974. Nevertheless, by 1975 some rolling stock was still preserved, such as three Henschel & Son locomotives and some cargo wagons.|$|R

On the route the price differential between rail and road is $12.97 per tonne in rail's favour. Pacific National closed their Portland operations in March 2008, with GrainCorp leasing a limited number of locomotives and rolling stock from them, but favour transporting grain to the Port of Geelong instead.|$|R
