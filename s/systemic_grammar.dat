Many researchers from home and abroad have explored it from various perspectives, including the perspective of discourse coherence; the perspective of syntax-pragmatics; the perspective of cognitive pragmatics and the perspective of metapragmatics. At the same time researchers at home mainly make specific analysis on certain discourse markers in terms of their pragmatic function.

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{effective}} machine translation systems the direction of translation is fundamental. "Import" translation from foreign languages into the user's language should be contrasted with "export" translation from the user's language into foreign languages. The structural transfer approach used in most current MT systems is very effective for import translation. But it is less effective for export translation, which is extremely dependent on the human post-editor. An alternative approach to export translation ([Wilcock 91]) uses a source language functional interface to a target language <b>systemic</b> <b>grammar</b> for generation. By helping the source language user to make choices in target language systems, the extreme dependence on the post-editor is reduced. Further developments of this approach are being investigated, including incremental refinement of the systemic choices for "forward generation" of the target text. Other desirable developments would be confirmation of the choices by "back generation" into the user language, and checking for ambiguity in the target text by "back translation"...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a methodology for the computational learning and classification of a <b>Systemic</b> Functional <b>Grammar.</b> A {{machine learning algorithm}} is developed that allows {{the structure of the}} classifier learned to be a representation of the <b>grammar.</b> Within <b>Systemic</b> Functional Linguistics, <b>Systemic</b> Functional <b>Grammar</b> is a model of language that has explicitly probabilistic distributions and overlapping categories. Mixture modeling is the most natural way to represent this, so the algorithm developed {{is one of the few}} machine learners that extends mixture modeling to supervised learning, retaining the desirable property that it is also able to discover intrinsic unlabelled categories. As a <b>Systemic</b> Function <b>Grammar</b> includes theories of context, syntax, semantics, function and lexis, it is a particularly difficult concept to learn, and this thesis presents the first attempt to infer and apply a truly probabilistic <b>Systemic</b> Functional <b>Grammar.</b> Because of this, the machine learning algorithm is benchmarked against a collection of state-ofthe- art learners on some well-known data sets. It is shown to be comparably accurate and particularly good at discovering and exploiting attribute correlation, and in this way it can also be seen as a linearly scalable solution to the Naïve Bayes attribute independence assumption. With a focus on function at the level of form, the methodology is shown to infer an accurate functional grammar that classifies with above 90 % accuracy, even across registers of text that are fundamentally very different from the one that was learned on. The discovery of unlabelled functions occurred with a high level of sophistication, and so the proposed methodology has very broad potential as an analytical and/or classification tool in a functional approach to Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing...|$|R
40|$|Linguistic {{theories}} can {{be divided}} into two varieties: those based on the form of linguis-tic expressions and those based on the function of linguistic expressions. Most present-day theories belong to the former variety. Because of their formal explicitness, the rule systems of these theories can be built into computer applications fairly straight-forwardly, although they provide no indication of the contexts and ways in which they should be applied appropriately. Theories based on linguistic function address matters of appropriate usage but frequently fail to supply enough low-level formal detail to facilitate computer implementation.

After the general elections of May 2004 in Tahiti, a series of controversial events unfolded which created polarity among the local people and which destabilised the government. This research aims to study qualitatively how the Tahitian political crisis is constructed by the French press, namely, le Figaro, le Monde and la Libération. Based on the CDA framework and Halliday's <b>systemic</b> <b>grammar,</b> this research embarks on Foucault's idea of subjectivity which governs the formation of discourse, by examining the linguistic structure of the clause in the press representations. The analysis reveals that events and people from the crisis can be configured in different ways in the clausal structure, which is, to a certain degree, triggered by the subjectivity of newspapers. La Libération offers a socialist view of the crisis through its discursive constructions which are more inclusive of the local people and by showing Temaru's rise to power in an optimistic manner. As for the conservative newspaper le Figaro, power hierarchies can be observed in some representations while certain individuals' responsibilities are hidden in the clausal structure. Even le Monde, which claims to maintain a neutral ground, exposes its intellectual and critical conceits in the construction of clauses which represent Tahiti's recent political crisis...|$|E
