5|$|An {{aboriginal}} Australian fable retold by the Welsh school headmaster William Jenkyn Thomas (1870–1959) {{tells how}} some animals needed a canoe {{to cross the}} ocean. Whale had one but refused to lend it, so Starfish kept him busy, telling him stories and grooming him to remove parasites, while the others stole the canoe. When Whale realized the trick he beat Starfish ragged, which is how Starfish <b>still</b> <b>is</b> today.|$|E

Production continued up until 1981 when the experiment with Lomond <b>stills</b> <b>was</b> abandoned, and the <b>stills</b> <b>were</b> replaced with regular stills.|$|R

5|$|The {{production}} process was and <b>still</b> <b>is</b> chemically straightforward, effectively dissolving lead in aqua fortis (nitric acid), and subsequently harvesting the precipitate. However, the production remained small-scale for many centuries, and the commercial production of lead(II) nitrate {{as raw material}} for the manufacture of other lead compounds was not reported until 1835. In 1974, the U.S. consumption of lead compounds, excluding pigments and gasoline additives, was 642tons.|$|E

5|$|Alright, <b>Still</b> <b>is</b> {{the debut}} studio album by English singer and {{songwriter}} Lily Allen, released on 13 July 2006 by Regal Recordings. After being rejected by several labels, Allen signed to London Records, who eventually {{lost interest in}} Allen, leading her to meet production duo Future Cut and sign to Regal Recordings. Recording for the album began in 2004 with sessions between Allen and Future Cut, and Allen's work garnered publicity on the Internet as she posted demos to her Myspace account before they were officially released. Allen later travelled to the United States to work with Greg Kurstin and Mark Ronson, to complete the final half of the album in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Although 247Bk is {{the most}} stable isotope of berkelium, its {{production}} in nuclear reactors is very inefficient due to the long half-life of its potential progenitor curium-247, which does not allow it sufficient time to beta decay before capturing another neutron. Thus, 249Bk {{is the most}} accessible isotope of berkelium, which <b>still,</b> <b>is</b> available only in small quantities (only 0.66grams have been produced in the US over the period 1967–1983) at a high price of the order 185 USD per microgram.|$|E
5|$|Although many false {{claims of}} its {{discovery}} were {{made over the}} years, the element was first synthesized by Edwin McMillan and Philip H.

The vast majority is generated as a by-product in conventional nuclear power reactors. While neptunium itself has no commercial uses at present, it {{is used as a}} precursor for the formation of plutonium-238, used in radioisotope thermal generators to provide electricity for spacecraft. Neptunium has also been used in detectors of high-energy neutrons.|$|E

5|$|From December 12, 1994, to January 2000, the PGSO did not hire any new deputies or {{civilian}} employees, {{leaving the}} agency with 92 vacant positions {{that needed to}} be filled. Over that period, 66 deputies left the agency, some retiring routinely, others leaving due to increased workloads caused by vacant positions. In some cases, deputies worked sixteen hours in one day, eight in courtrooms, and eight serving warrants. In December 1994, the agency had 248 deputies, whereas on January 20, 2000, it only had 192 deputies, with 20 leaving from November 1998 to January 2000. In July 1996, the county government decreased the amount of funding the PGSO was receiving. Unlike the PGPD at the time, the PGSO was not nationally accredited and <b>still</b> <b>is</b> not, as of January 2015. Computers were also in short supply, and the few that were in use were outdated and obsolete.|$|E
5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls and a solid steel door. He screams at the officer that he <b>still</b> <b>is</b> not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} chemical and physical properties of solid berkelium and its compounds, a program was initiated in 1952 at the Material Testing Reactor, Arco, Idaho, US. It resulted in preparation of an eight-gram plutonium-239 target {{and in the}} first production of macroscopic quantities (0.6micrograms) of berkelium by Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thompson in 1958, after a continuous reactor irradiation of this target for six years. This irradiation method was and <b>still</b> <b>is</b> the only way of producing weighable amounts of the element, and most solid-state studies of berkelium have been conducted on microgram or submicrogram-sized samples.|$|E

5|$|Merit can {{be gained}} {{in a number}} of ways, such as giving, virtue and mental development. In addition, there are many forms of merit-making {{described}} in ancient Buddhist texts. A similar concept of kusala (Sanskrit: kusala) is also known, which is different from merit in some details. The most fruitful form of merit-making is those good deeds done with regard to the Triple Gem, that is, the Buddha, his teachings, the Dhamma (Sanskrit: Dharma), and the Sangha. In Buddhist societies, a great variety of practices involving merit-making has grown throughout the centuries, sometimes involving great self-sacrifice. Merit has become part of rituals, daily and weekly practice, and festivals. In addition, there is a widespread custom of transferring merit to one's deceased relatives, of which the origin is still a matter of scholarly debate. Merit has been that important in Buddhist societies, that kingship was often legitimated through it, and <b>still</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
