40|$|Abstract: In {{manufacturing}} area, one of {{the most}} complex technological processes is the machining of spiral bevel gears. For these processes, special machine tools designed with peculiar manuals for calculating the gear geometry, and the setting-up processes were developed. The known technologies and design of gear-cutting machine tools are different and based on processes that cut the concave and convex sides of the spiral tooth separately or simultaneously. These processes are different in productivity and quality of gear machining. Due to these circumstances, manufacturers created many modifications, with different qualities of the gear-cutting processes. Presently, there are following technologies: continuous indexing (face-hobbing) and single indexing (face-milling) that unlimitedly available to the user. This paper presents a new face-milling process of machining spiral bevel gears that can increase productivity and improve the quality of gears. The new process presents a solution that uses two cutter heads simultaneously for machining both concave and convex sides of the <b>spiral</b> <b>teeth.</b> Manufacturers can accept the new technology of the spiral bevel gear that needs a wide spectrum of research to get optimal solutions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. From the {{definition}} of logarithmic spiral and its particular characteristics, logarithmic spiral is discussed and adopted as the tooth back curve of the relieving shaped milling cutter under the new manufacturing conditions. Thus, the relief angle of each point {{on the cutting edge}} keeps instant after regrinding the cutter and thereby makes for preserving the machinability stability. Besides, cutter structure parameters determine coefficient values in the equation of logarithmic <b>spiral</b> <b>tooth</b> back curve. Based on the objected-oriented thought, a CAD system for the relieving shaped milling cutter with logarithmic <b>spiral</b> <b>tooth</b> back is developed in virtue of the language of VBA embedded in AutoCAD, which achieves the automatic generation of logarithmic spiral, realizes the cutter parametric design, shortens the whole cycle and improves the design quality...|$|R

50|$|The bag {{is loaded}} {{using the same}} forage {{harvesting}} methods as the tower, but the forage wagon must be moved progressively forward with the bag loader. The loader uses an array of rotating cam-shaped <b>spiraled</b> <b>teeth</b> associated with a large comb-shaped tines to push forage into the bag. The forage is pushed in through a large opening, and as the teeth rotate back out, they pass between the comb tines. The cam-shaped auger teeth essentially wipe the forage off using the steel tines, keeping the forage in the bag.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the <b>spiral</b> <b>tooth</b> over the straight tooth is that they engage more gradually. The contact between the teeth starts {{at one end of}} the gear and then spreads across the whole tooth. This results in a less abrupt transfer of force when a new pair of teeth come into play. With straight bevel gears, the abrupt tooth engagement causes noise, especially at high speeds, and impact stress on the teeth which makes them unable to take heavy loads at high speeds without breaking. For these reasons straight bevel gears are generally limited to use at linear speeds less than 1000 feet/min; or, for small gears, under 1000 r.p.m.|$|R

40|$|The {{localization}} of {{the contact}} patch by cylindrical gears is realized usually through the flank grinding operation. This is achieved due by the continuous {{modification of the}} tooth thickness on the pitch circle. The tooth contact by external gears, as it knows by previous studies, will be produced between convex tooth flanks. M??t?? and Hollanda in [5] proposes a new procedure of cutting cylindrical gears using a milling head whose cutting edges are aligned on an Archimedic <b>spiral.</b> The meshing <b>tooth</b> results with a convex and a concave flank. As a consequence the localization of the contact patch will be achieved by modifying the surface curvature through variation of {{the parameters of the}} generating surface.

The method assumes that the surface curvature of each tooth is constant near the unloaded pitch point. Results from these calculations will help designers reduce transmission weight without seriously reducing transmission performance...|$|R

It generates nodes and solid elements to model spur, helical, or <b>spiral</b> bevel gear <b>teeth</b> with integral shafting. Either a complete gear shafting model or a symmetric model is created. The fundamental building block of the gear model is the base layer. The base layer is the mesh configuration of one layer of one tooth segment which is in turn duplicated, translated, and rotated to create the completed model of the gear. Once the base layer is created, the construction of the finite element model is straightforward...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} {{problems}} with the operation of spiral bevel gears is related to very severe conditions in the contact of the meshing teeth; therefore, lubrication is very difficult, which {{increases the risk of}} scuffing occurrence. One of the ways to achieve better scuffing resistance is by the deposition of a low-friction coating on the bevel gears teeth. Gear scuffing tests were performed using a bevel gear test rig designed and manufactured at ITeE-PIB. The authorial bevel gear scuffing test was performed. Specially designed, spiral bevel gears were used for testing. Two material combinations were tested: uncoated pinion- coated wheel and, for reference, both gears without coatings. The a-C:H:W (trade name WC/C) coating of DLC type was deposited on the wheel teeth. A mineral, automotive gear oil of API GL- 5 performance level was used for lubrication. It is shown that the resistance to scuffing may be significantly improved when the a-C:H:W coating is deposited on the <b>spiral</b> bevel gear <b>teeth...</b>|$|R
40|$|In general, {{the shaft}} angle of {{automotive}} hypoid gears is 90 degrees. Therefore, the design method of an angular hypoid gear {{had not been}} investigated sufficiently up to now. Moreover, the <b>tooth</b> <b>spiral</b> of the hypoid gear is generally on the right hand and the pinion axis is offset below the gear axis. Therefore, when the pinion axis is offset conversely, the design method has not been investigated in detail. In the present report, by using basic equations on the angular hypoid gear with an opposite offset obtained in the previous paper, the design dimensions of the angular hypoid gear whose shaft angle is {{in the region of}} 70 ～ 100 -degrees are shown. As a result, it was found that as the shaft angle increases the pitch angle of the gear increases, but that of the pinion does not so much change and the bias angle which shows the inclination of the tooth bearing changes negatively or positively the sign near the 90 -degree shaft angle on the drive-side tooth surface...|$|R
40|$|Presented is Tredgold’s Approximation {{for using}} an {{equivalent}} cylindrical gear with spur teeth to “approximate” a bevel gear with straight teeth. This relation is extended to spiral bevel and hypoid gears by utilizing pitch surface curvature {{in the direction}} perpendicular to the gear <b>tooth</b> <b>spiral</b> to establish an equivalent gear. Subsequently, the envelope of a planar gear tooth profile in this perpendicular direction is presented. The envelope of the gear tooth profile is used to determine fully conjugate gear teeth profiles for spatial gear elements. This procedure is valid for any tooth profile along with circular and non-circular gears. To validate the methodology, a virtual model of a bevel gear pair (“presented model”) is created and an unloaded tooth contact analysis is performed. The procedure used to perform the unloaded tooth contact analysis and determine the corresponding unloaded transmission error {{is based on the}} concept of ease-off topography. An example of a face-milled bevel gear pair (“literature model”) serves as a reference of correctness in determining the ease-off for unloaded contact. To conclude the paper, the obtained ease-off topography and unloaded transmission error of the presented model are calculated and displayed, demonstrating the specification of fully conjugate teeth. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the incidence of}} apical root canal transportation after the removal of calcium hydroxide in straight and curved canals. Materials and Methods: Twenty maxillary central incisors (Group A) and twenty mandibular molars (Group B, mesiobuccal canal) were instrumented to the working length using # 15 to # 45 K-file and # 15 to # 30 K-file, respectively. Post instrumentation digital images were taken with the corresponding final file inserted into the canal to the working length. The root canals were then filled with Calcium hydroxide paste using Lentulo <b>spirals</b> and the <b>teeth</b> incubated at 37 °C for seven days. The calcium hydroxide paste was then removed up to the working length using a # 45 file for group A and a pre curved # 30 file for group B.

Post instrumentation and final digital images were superimposed to {{evaluate the}} incidence of transportation. Result: In Group A, no transportation was detected, whereas in Group B, 8 out of 20 canals showed apical transportation.

40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{to predict the}} shift of the contact ellipse between the meshing <b>teeth</b> in a <b>spiral</b> bevel gear set is presented in this report. The contact ellipse shift of interest is {{the motion of the}} nominal tooth contact location on each tooth from the ideal pitch point to the point of contact between the two teeth considering the elastic motions of the gears and their supporting shafts. This is the shift of the pitch point from the ideal, unloaded position on each tooth to the nominal contact location on the tooth when the gears are fully loaded. It is assumed that the major contributors of this motion are the elastic deflections of the gear shafts, the slopes of the shafts under load and the radial deflections of the four gear shaft bearings. The motions of the two pitch point locations on the pinion and the gear tooth surfaces are calculated in a FORTRAN program which also calculates the size and orientation of the Hertzian contact ellipse on the tooth faces. Based on the curvatures of the two <b>spiral</b> bevel gear <b>teeth</b> {{and the size of the}} contact ellipse, the program also predicts the basic dynamic capacity of the tooth pair. A complete numerical example is given to illustrate the use of the program...|$|R
50|$|Hypoid gears {{resemble}} {{spiral bevel}} gears except the shaft axes do not intersect. The pitch surfaces appear conical but, {{to compensate for the}} offset shaft, are in fact hyperboloids of revolution. Hypoid gears are almost always designed to operate with shafts at 90 degrees. Depending on which side the shaft is offset to, relative to the angling of the teeth, contact between hypoid gear teeth may be even smoother and more gradual than with <b>spiral</b> bevel gear <b>teeth,</b> but also have a sliding action along the meshing teeth as it rotates and therefore usually require some of the most viscous types of gear oil to avoid it being extruded from the mating tooth faces, the oil is normally designated HP (for hypoid) followed by a number denoting the viscosity. Also, the pinion can be designed with fewer <b>teeth</b> than a <b>spiral</b> bevel pinion, with the result that gear ratios of 60:1 and higher are feasible using a single set of hypoid gears. This style of gear is most common in motor vehicle drive trains, in concert with a differential. Whereas a regular (nonhypoid) ring-and-pinion gear set is suitable for many applications, it is not ideal for vehicle drive trains because it generates more noise and vibration than a hypoid does. Bringing hypoid gears to market for mass-production applications was an engineering improvement of the 1920s.|$|R

Drawbacks are also specified, and recommendations are provided {{in terms of the}} hydro-mechanical {{analysis and}} the construction of spiral chambers of combined pump-chamber units and centrifugal pumps. Liquid flow pattern in spiral chambers of centrifugal pumps and combined pump-chamber units, when operating in the pump mode, has a diffuser character, and circulatory streams, flowing in opposite directions, evolve there; streams move clockwise in the bottom area of the cross section, and in the upper area, stream move counter clockwise (when directions of water flows inside chambers are considered). The presence of circulatory streams and the diffuser nature of the flow inside spiral chambers of centrifugal pumps and combined pump-chamber units boost uneven distribution of velocities and the loss of pressure inside chambers and trail races. The loss of energy (pressure) in spiral chambers and trail races of the above machines can be reduced, if the output section of the spiral has the shape of a torus with a central angle φ= 45 …. 55 o, taken in-between the output section of the <b>spiral</b> and its <b>tooth,</b> while the cross sectional area is equal to the section area calculated as Vu ∙ r = const or V ср ∙ r = const (this section of the spiral is the initial section of the torus) ...|$|R
40|$|Spiral {{bevel gears}} are used widely in the {{transmission}} systems of several mechanical applications. The design of {{spiral bevel gears}} is very complicated. This {{is due to the}} complexity of the gear tooth geometry. This research concentrates on a special type of spiral bevel gears, the Palloid spiral bevel gears. The design methodology is based on the concepts of the machine kinematics. This delivers a numerical model of the <b>spiral</b> bevel gear <b>tooth</b> surfaces. The concept of a three dimensional vector analysis is applied. In addition, the condition of the tangential contact between the meshing surfaces of the cutting tool and gear blank is utilised. This is performed using the mathematical modelling software package MATLAB. The data points of the gear tooth surfaces obtained from MATLAB are defined as the nodes of the finite element mesh avoiding using a CAD package. In order to achieve high accuracy of gear geometry CAD software has to be avoided as the loss of accuracy is a problem combined with using CAD software.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} spiral bevel gear rig tests performed under a NASA Space Act Agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to support validation and demonstration of rotorcraft Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) for maintenance credits via FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 29 - 2 C, Section MG- 15, Airworthiness Approval of Rotorcraft (HUMS) (Ref. 1). The overarching goal of this work was to determine a method to validate condition indicators in the lab that better represent their response to faults in the field. Using existing in-service helicopter HUMS flight data from faulted spiral bevel gears as a "Case Study," {{to better understand the}} differences between both systems, and the availability of the NASA Glenn Spiral Bevel Gear Fatigue Rig, a plan was put in place to design, fabricate and test comparable gear sets with comparable failure modes within the constraints of the test rig. The research objectives of the rig tests were to evaluate the capability of detecting gear surface pitting fatigue and other generated failure modes on <b>spiral</b> bevel gear <b>teeth</b> using gear condition indicators currently used in fielded HUMS. Nineteen final design gear sets were tested. Tables were generated for each test, summarizing the failure modes observed on the gear teeth for each test during each inspection interval and color coded based on damage mode per inspection photos. Gear condition indicators (CI) Figure of Merit 4 (FM 4), Root Mean Square (RMS), +/- 1 Sideband Index (SI 1) and +/- 3 Sideband Index (SI 3) were plotted along with rig operational parameters. Statistical tables of {{the means and standard deviations}} were calculated within inspection intervals for each CI. As testing progressed, it became clear that certain condition indicators were more sensitive to a specific component and failure mode. These tests were clustered together for further analysis. Maintenance actions during testing were also documented. Correlation coefficients were calculated between each CI, component, damage state and torque. Results found test rig and gear design, type of fault and data acquisition can affect CI performance. Results found FM 4, SI 1 and SI 3 can be used to detect macro pitting on two more gear or pinion teeth as long as it is detected prior to progressing to other components or transitioning to another failure mode. The sensitivity of RMS to system and operational conditions limit its reliability for systems that are not maintained at steady state. Failure modes that occurred due to scuffing or fretting were challenging to detect with current gear diagnostic tools, since the damage is distributed across all the gear and pinion teeth, smearing the impacting signatures typically used to differentiate between a healthy and damaged tooth contact. This is one of three final reports published on the results of this project. In the second report, damage modes experienced in the field will be mapped to the failure modes created in the test rig. The helicopter CI data will then be re-processed with the same analysis techniques applied to spiral bevel rig test data. In the third report, results from the rig and helicopter data analysis will be correlated. Observations, findings and lessons learned using sub-scale rig failure progression tests to validate helicopter gear condition indicators will be presented...|$|R
