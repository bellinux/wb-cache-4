40|$|A {{literature}} {{survey of the}} properties of synfuels for ground-based gas turbine applications is presented. Four major concepts for converting coal into liquid fuels are described: solvent extraction, catalytic liquefaction, pyrolysis, and indirect liquefaction. Data on full range syncrudes, various distillate cuts, and upgraded products are presented for fuels derived from various processes, including H-coal, synthoil, <b>solvent-refined</b> coal, donor solvent, zinc chloride hydrocracking, co-steam, and flash pyrolysis. Some typical ranges of data for coal-derived low Btu gases are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Employment impacts, from a {{proposed}} <b>solvent-refined</b> coal plant, are examined {{by use of}} an adjustment model which departs from the more conventional export-base and input - output approaches. Adjustments in the regional labor-market are outlined {{through the use of}} a Markov-chain model of job vacancy transfers. Adjustments, in response to labor-demand shocks generated by the projects, are specified for disequilibrium gaps in the open labor market, with in-migration of workers absorbing job vacancies. Empirical estimates of key parameters are derived from previous studies of impacts in order to make a preliminary simulation of the system. Implications for an area in West Virginia designated as a regional labor-market are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Studies with {{a variety}} of {{chemically}} purified substances have suggested that induction of the enzyme ornithine decar-boxylase (ODC) in mouse epidermal cells may be a reliable in-dicator of neoplastic transformation. In an effort to extend these observations on ODC to chemically complex materials, we examined ODC induction by carcinogenic and non-car-cinogenic mixtures and compared these results with tumori-genidty data for these materials. For these studies several boiling range fractions and several solvent-derived subtrac-tions from two <b>solvent-refined</b> coal processes (SRC-I and SRC-ID were evaluated for their ability to induce ODC. Single applications of heavy distillate (HD), the SRC-II high-boiling fraction and a potent mouse skin carcinogen, produc-ed ODC induction kinetics which were similar to that fo...|$|E
40|$|Cubic insulin {{crystals}} contain approximately 30 -A-diameter channels {{filled with}} aqueous solvent, providing a useful {{system in which}} to analyze hydration structure {{at a variety of}} distances from protein surfaces. Beginning with an atomic model for the protein and ordered water molecules, the density distribution in the solvent volume of the phasing model was iteratively refined to improve the fit of calculated structure factors with x-ray diffraction data. The free R value, which compares calculated structure factors with a subset of observed structure factors deliberately omitted from the refinement, was used to provide an objective confirmation of the effectiveness of the refinement procedure. Electron density maps of the solvent, computed using the <b>solvent-refined</b> phases and complete low-resolution diffraction data, reveal multiple hydration layers around the protein...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{graphite}} is {{an important}} industrial material, used in nuclear reactors, electrodes and many other applications. Graphitisation of coke is the solid-state transformation of the disordered carbon atoms into a well-ordered hexagonal graphite structure, requiring temperatures as high as 2 600 ºC. Catalytic graphitisation using metals or metal compounds allows the rearrangement of atoms to occur at lower temperatures. The extent of catalytic graphitisation is markedly dependent on the structural ordering of the parent coke, the catalyst concentration and the reaction conditions. Solvent extraction of coal using dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent yields a refined coal solution referred to as Refcoal solution. Cokes of <b>solvent-refined</b> Tshikondeni coal derivatives {{have been found to}} be graphitisable. The activity of acetylacetonate and hydroxyquinolinate complexes of Al, Ca, Cu, Fe and Zr for catalysing the graphitisation of Refcoal cokes at 1 600 and 2 000 ºC was investigated. The effect of residence time on the catalytic graphitisation of Refcoal cokes was investigated by heat-treating cokes for two and six hours at 1 600 °C. For iron(III) acetylacetonate, the effect of metal concentrations was studied. Samples were analysed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and optical microscope techniques. The results show that calcium(II) acetylacetonate catalyses the graphitisation of Refcoal cokes. The degree of graphitisation increases with an increase in the iron concentration. However, iron promotes localised graphitisation, probably in the vicinity of the catalyst particles. Dissertation (MSc (Chemistry)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008. Chemistryunrestricte...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{refinery}} streams {{were tested}} in both chronic and initiation/promotion (I/P) skin bioassays. In the chronic bioassay, groups of 50 C 3 H/HeJ mice received twice weekly applications of 50 microl of test article for at least 2 years. In the initiation phase of the I/P bioassay, groups of CD- 1 mice received an initiating dose of 50 microl of test article for 5 consecutive days, followed by promotion with 50 microl of phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (0. 01 % w/v in acetone) for 25 weeks. In the promotion phase of the I/P bioassay, CD- 1 mice were initiated with 50 microl of 7, 12 -dimethylbenzanthracene (0. 1 % w/v in acetone) or acetone, followed by promotion with 50 microl of test article twice weekly for 25 weeks. The most volatile of the streams, sweetened naphtha, and the least volatile, vacuum residuum, were noncarcinogenic in both assays. Middle distillates, with a boiling range of 150 degrees- 370 degreesC, demonstrated carcinogenic activity in the chronic bioassay and acted as promoters but not initiators in the I/P bioassay. Untreated mineral oil streams displayed initiating activity and were carcinogenic in the chronic bioassay, presumably due {{to the presence of}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of requisite size and structure. A highly <b>solvent-refined</b> mineral oil stream lacked initiating activity. These results indicate that the I/P bioassay, which takes 6 months to complete, may be a good qualitative predictor of the results of a chronic bioassay, at least for petroleum streams. Furthermore, the I/P bioassay can provide insight into possible mechanisms of tumor development...|$|E
