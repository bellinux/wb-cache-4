5|$|In February 2013, a self-declared Pastafarian {{was denied}} the right to wear a {{spaghetti}} <b>strainer</b> on his head for his driver's license photo by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, which stated that a pasta <b>strainer</b> was not on a list of approved religious headwear.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013 a Belgian's {{identity}} {{photos were}} refused {{by the local}} and national administrations because he wore a pasta <b>strainer</b> on his head.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011 Austrian pastafarian Niko Alm won {{the legal}} right to be shown in his driving license photo wearing a pasta <b>strainer</b> on his head, after three years spent {{pursuing}} permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. He got the idea after reading that Austrian regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons. Some sources report that the colander in the form of pasta <b>strainer,</b> was recognised by Austrian authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011. This was denied by Austrian authorities, saying that religious motives were not the reason to grant the permission of wearing the headgear in a passport.|$|E
50|$|These {{types of}} <b>strainers</b> are {{installed}} in pipeline systems where flow cannot be stopped. Depending upon their NB size {{they are capable}} of filtration up to 40 µm. Basket <b>Strainers</b> find use in industries where impurities are mostly solids. Unlike other types of <b>strainers,</b> it is easy to conduct maintenance on these <b>strainers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Strainers</b> - Although {{not entirely}} unique to creeking, <b>strainers</b> or downed trees {{can be much}} more {{dangerous}} in creeks because they can often span the width of smaller river. <b>Strainers</b> can act like sieves, trapping boats and people on their upstream side.|$|R
25|$|<b>Strainers</b> {{are formed}} by many natural or {{man-made}} objects, like storm grates over tunnels, trees that {{have fallen into}} a river ("log jam"), bushes {{by the side of}} the river that are flooded during high water, wire fence, rebar from broken concrete structures in the water, or other debris. <b>Strainers</b> occur naturally most often on the outside curves of rivers where the current undermines the shore exposing the roots of trees and causing them to fall into the river forming <b>strainers.</b>|$|R
5|$|In June 2014 a New Zealand man {{obtained}} a driver's license with {{a photograph of}} himself wearing a blue spaghetti <b>strainer</b> on his head. This was granted under a law allowing the wearing of religious headgear in official photos.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014 former {{porn star}} Asia Carrera {{obtained}} an identity photo {{with the traditional}} Pastafarian headgear from a Department of Motor Vehicles office in Hurricane, Utah. The director of Utah's Driver License Division says that about a dozen Pastafarians have had their state driver's license photos taken with a similar pasta <b>strainer</b> over the years.|$|E
5|$|Bishop John Harewell {{raised money}} for the {{completion}} of the west front by William Wynford, who was appointed as master mason in 1365. One of the foremost architects of his time, Wynford worked for the king at Windsor, Winchester Cathedral and New College, Oxford. At Wells, he designed the western towers of which north-west was not built until the following century. In the 14th century, the central piers of the crossing were found to be sinking {{under the weight of the}} crossing tower which had been damaged by an earthquake in the previous century. <b>Strainer</b> arches, sometimes described as scissor arches, were inserted by master mason William Joy to brace and stabilise the piers as a unit.|$|E

5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea <b>strainer,</b> a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|The only {{abnormality}} {{found in}} all four engines was the vapour vent float in the fuel <b>strainer</b> chamber of the carburettors. The floats had been crushed by extreme fuel pressure. Inquiries {{were made to the}} engine manufacturer and other civil aviation authorities but none had prior experience of vapour vent floats collapsing. Tests on carburettors were also carried out in Australia by the Aeronautical Research Laboratories but without finding any suitable explanation. Whether the floats were crushed in flight or in the crash could not be determined, but even if it had occurred in flight it would not have affected operation of the engines.|$|E
5|$|The 19th century also {{witnessed}} {{two major}} restorations to St Denys'. As the congregation expanded, {{the need for}} greater space was met {{with the addition of}} a new north aisle in 1853. This coincided with a wider restoration project carried out at the cost of £3,500 by Kirk and Parry, which included the demolition of the galleries, the addition of a <b>strainer</b> arch and the relocation of the organ. The church was damaged by an electrical storm in 1884 and parts, including the stone broach spire—one of the oldest in England—were rebuilt by Kirk and Parry in 1885–86. The old organ was sold in 1891 and St Hugh's Chapel and the choir vestry were dedicated to the memory of a local solicitor, Henry Snow, in 1906. Electric lighting was introduced in 1951–53 and extensive restoration work was carried out in 1966, when the organ was rebuilt, and in 1988. Fifty-four solar panels were added in 2008, at the cost of £70,000, and by 2011 were able to cover the church's electricity bill.|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} with the requested actions of Reference (a), Vermont Yankee is informing the staff of completion of our actions. During our 1998 Refueling Outage, Vermont Yankee installed large, passive, ECCS <b>strainers</b> under the provisions of 1 OCFR 50. 59. A description of how design inputs were chosen in our design of the <b>strainers</b> is provided in Attachment 1. Part of the design inputs for our <b>strainers</b> included the performance of plant-specific testing for behavior of coating debris. A proprietary description of this testing and the results is included in Attachment 2. Attachment 2 of the enclosed information is considered proprietary information by Duke Engineering and Services (DE&S). In {{accordance with}} 1 OCFR 2. 790 (b) (1), an affidavit attesting to the proprietary nature of the enclosed information is attached. A non-proprietary version of the testing and results is included in Attachment 3. In addition to the installation of new, high debris capacity <b>strainers,</b> the Torus inner surface, from the waterline and below, was re-coated with a qualified coating. Also, the drywell was cleaned and confirmed free of foreign material following an inspection in accordance with our drywell close-out procedure. The Torus was confirmed to be clear of foreign material following our replacement of <b>strainers</b> and re-coating project. The drywell vents and downcomers were likewise inspected and verified {{to be free of}} foreign materials...|$|R
25|$|In an {{emergency}} {{it is often}} best to try to climb {{on top of a}} <b>strainer</b> {{so as not to be}} pinned against the object under the water. In a river, swimming aggressively away from the <b>strainer</b> and into the main channel is recommended. If it is impossible to avoid the <b>strainer,</b> one should swim hard towards it and try to get as much of one's body up and over it as possible.|$|E

25|$|Today, in the Samoa 'ava ceremony, {{the role}} of the aumaga is a {{comprehensive}} term, but in former times the 'ava makers were a much more select guild. In the preparation of the 'ava for a ceremony the services of a young woman or young man, or one or more young ladies and young men may be utilised. It is customary for the daughters of all chiefs to be taught how to prepare the 'ava. If the person mixing the 'ava is a young woman, it is customary for her to be the virgin daughter of a chief (matai). The 'ava mixer, sits behind the tanoa bowl and thoroughly mixes the 'ava as another member of the aumaga adds water from time to time. As the mixing proceeds, the 'ava mixer from time to time wrings the liquid from the <b>strainer</b> and folding the same into half its usual length passes it to another member of the aumaga standing outside or {{near the edge of the}} house who frees the <b>strainer</b> of the woody particles of the 'ava by several violent flicks. He then quickly passes the <b>strainer</b> back to the mixer who proceeds until all the particles of the dried root are removed. The stylised movements and serious concentration in the making of the 'ava are part of the ritual pattern in the ceremony. The water poured into the bowl as the mixing proceeds is done from either the left or right, not from in front. The action of mixing is one of contracting and expanding the fingers of the two hands as the <b>strainer</b> is slowly worked towards the mixer. When the mixing is completed the rim of the bowl is wiped to remove any water or woody material and the <b>strainer</b> is folded up and placed on the rim of the bowl. The mixer then places both hands on the bowl and sits quietly awaiting the next move in the ceremony.|$|E

25|$|This is {{essentially}} the same as the melochah of Borer, but performed with a utensil specifically designed for the purpose of sorting, such as a sieve, <b>strainer,</b> or the like. As such, Borer acts done with such a device, such as the netting of a tea bag, would be classed as an act of Merakaid (Sieving/Straining).|$|E
25|$|Some teas, {{especially}} green teas {{and delicate}} oolong teas, are steeped for shorter periods, sometimes less than 30 seconds. Using a tea <b>strainer</b> separates the {{leaves from the}} water {{at the end of}} the brewing time if a tea bag is not being used. However, the black Darjeeling tea, a premium Indian tea, needs a longer than average steeping time. Elevation and time of harvest offer varying taste profiles; proper storage and water quality also have a large impact on taste.|$|E

25|$|The lid was a {{hammered}} bronze sheet, weighing 13.8kg {{and shaped}} {{to fit the}} krater's opening. It is concave and perforated by multiple holes, probably because it {{also served as a}} <b>strainer</b> for purifying wine. A protrusion at its centre supports a 19cm statuette of moulded bronze, depicting a woman with one outstretched arm, which once may have held some object. She wears a peplos, the body-length Ancient Greek garment worn by women, and her head is covered by a veil. The statuette appears of a somewhat older style than figures {{on the rest of the}} vessel.|$|E
25|$|Whole Peking Ducks can {{be ordered}} as takeaways. The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven, grill or boiling oil. When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a {{temperature}} of 150°C (300°F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160°C (325°F) for another 10 minutes. The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a griddle, 70cm (28in) above the cooking fire. The boiling water is replaced every 3–4 minutes until the duck's skin is piping hot. To reheat the Peking Duck with oil, the duck is sliced into thin pieces {{and placed in a}} <b>strainer</b> held over a wok of boiling oil. The duck is then rinsed several times with the oil.|$|E
25|$|Variations on {{the flavor}} are gained by adding root {{vegetables}} such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup {{should be brought}} slowly {{to a boil and}} then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat {{off the top of the}} soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a <b>strainer</b> or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.|$|E
