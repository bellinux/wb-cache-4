2500|$|In {{the very}} early {{versions}} of quicksort, the leftmost element of the partition would often be chosen as <b>the</b> <b>pivot</b> element. Unfortunately, this causes worst-case behavior on already sorted arrays, which is a rather common use-case. The problem was easily solved by choosing either a random index <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pivot,</b> choosing <b>the</b> middle index of the partition or (especially for longer partitions) choosing the median of the first, middle and last element of <b>the</b> partition <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pivot</b> (as recommended by Sedgewick). This [...] "median-of-three" [...] rule counters the case of sorted (or reverse-sorted) input, and gives a better estimate of <b>the</b> optimal <b>pivot</b> (<b>the</b> true median) than selecting any single element, when no information about the ordering of the input is known.|$|R

Similarly, Benjaminse et al. [13] published a meta-analysis on the reliability of the same tests reported by Sholten et al. [17]. Twenty-eight scientific papers were included. They found a similar pooled sensitivity and pooled specificity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Lachman test (0.85 and 0.94, respectively) but not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pivot</b> shift test and the anterior drawer test. They reported a pooled sensitivity of 0.24 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pivot</b> shift test and a higher pooled sensitivity and specificity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> anterior drawer test (0.92 and 0.91, respectively), even for chronic cases only.
