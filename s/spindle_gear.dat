40|$|Abstract. As a key {{component}} of heavy five-axis linkage CNC machine tools, the existing mechanical biaxial rotary milling heads are usually driven by worm gear, timing belt, or multi-stage gears. Worm gear is inefficiency to transmit motion, hard to maintain the accuracy and difficult to eliminate all clearance; Timing belt can be seriously worn and cannot maintain good accuracy; and multi-stage gears transmission has defects such as long chain, low transmission stiffness. This paper aims at designing a biaxial rotary milling head with large output torque of 3000 Nm, high precision and high rigidity. So a new design for biaxial rotary milling head with mechanical <b>spindle,</b> <b>gear</b> transmission and swinging fork structure is proposed. An integral supporting axis is applied to increase the rigidity of A-axis; through the closed numerical loop control based on precise encoder and the decoupling technology of feed motion of A/C axis, the contradiction between large reduction ratio and high precision transmission is solved, and then the requirement of high positioning accuracy (10 ") is met. Theoretical calculation and simulated analysis shown, the new design not only can guarantee transmission accuracy and dynamic characteristics of biaxial rotary milling head, but also can improve its structural stiffness and meet the high demands of large torque, high precision and high rigidity...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 27 A major {{chemical}} company has implemented a cost reduction and performance enhancement via universal joints on a melt pump application. The melt pump {{is used to}} push molten polyethylene through a die to produce pellets. The pump takes material at 30 psig and 200 C (390 F) and discharges at 3000 psig. Misalignment between the gearbox and melt pump gear centers is approximately one degree. The authors jointly studied the existing {{problems associated with the}} <b>gear</b> <b>spindles</b> (high angle <b>gear</b> coupling) : primarily reduced life, high maintenance, and high repair costs {{due in large part to}} high operating temperatures and the seal design of <b>gear</b> <b>spindle</b> at high misalignment, and proposed block style universal joints to solve the problems. The universal joints replaced the <b>gear</b> <b>spindles</b> supplied originally by the pump manufacturer. This paper demonstrates the block style universal joints were able to: ?	Significantly reduce plant downtime. ?	Eliminate high repair costs associated with <b>gear</b> <b>spindles,</b> for the chemical company. ?	Reduce wear and tear on the melt pump compared to <b>gear</b> <b>spindles.</b> ?	Improve yield (or production) through superior performance and reliability. ?	Reduce noise levels. These block type universal joints have been running for over five years now and have been inspected once after 24 months of operation with only general wear and tear from normal operation.

50|$|The feedscrew (H8) {{is a long}} {{driveshaft}} {{that allows}} a series of gears to drive the carriage mechanisms. These gears {{are located in the}} apron of the carriage. Both the feedscrew and leadscrew (H7) are driven by either the change gears (on the quadrant) or an intermediate gearbox known as a quick change gearbox (H6) or Norton gearbox. These intermediate gears allow the correct ratio and direction to be set for cutting threads or worm gears. Tumbler gears (operated by H5) are provided between the <b>spindle</b> and <b>gear</b> train along with a quadrant plate that enables a gear train of the correct ratio and direction to be introduced. This provides a constant relationship between the number of turns the spindle makes, to the number of turns the leadscrew makes. This ratio allows screwthreads to be cut on the workpiece without the aid of a die.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{measurement}} setup to identify bending and torsional properties of ice hockey sticks with similar stiffness and length from various manufacturers during static bending and torsion tests on a test stand. The test stand is composed of a clamp system, a <b>spindle</b> lifting <b>gear</b> with a load cell and three distance sensors. For the bending test the ice hockey sticks were clamped to the test stand and a three point load test simulated real conditions. To bend the stick identically to an actual wrist shot the supports were positioned in order that the distance of the supports conforms to the distance between the hands of an ice hockey player during a wrist shot. Three different loads of 150, 200 and 250 N were applied on ten test positions along the hockey sticks’ shaft and blade. For the torsion test the hockey sticks were also clamped to the test stand, but the second support was removed. A special rotatable frame was mounted on five different positions along the shaft down to the blade where torque was applied (29, 43. 5 and 58 Nm). The bending test showed that the differences increase with increasing distance to clamping position and higher loads. At each position the deviation of stick B is higher compared to the deviation of stick A, despite similar FLEX values. The results for the torsion tests show that the torsion of stick A is higher compared to the torsion of stick B. This trend could be observed at each position and torque. With the same torque applied at the same position the torsion angle of stick A is twice as high compared to stick B. Based on the findings of this research further studies of how the different bending and torsional properties affect the accuracy and speed of actual wrist shots will be performed in the near future...|$|R

Turning {{is the most}} common process used {{in manufacturing}} sector to produce smooth finish on cylindrical surfaces. Surface roughness is the important performance characteristics to be considered in the turning process is affected by several factors such as cutting tool material, spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut and material properties. In this research Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to determine the optimum machining parameters leading to minimum surface roughness in turning process. The main purpose of this research is to study the effect of carbide inserts on EN- 24 Alloy Steel surface by using three parameters (spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut). This research was conducted by using 100 HS Stallion CNC Lathe machine. Seventeen sets of experiments were performed. In this work empirical models were developed for surface roughness by considering spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut as main controlling factors using response surface methodology. The optimum value of the surface roughness (Ra) comes out to be 0. 48 µm. It is also concluded that feed rate is the most significant factor affecting surface roughness followed by depth of cut. As Cutting speed is the less significant factor affecting surface roughness. Optimum results are finally verified with the help of confirmation experiments. Keywords...|$|R
40|$|In a {{proposed}} advance in friction stir welding, the torque exerted on the workpiece by the friction stir pin would be measured and controlled {{in an effort}} to measure and control the total heat input to the workpiece. The total heat input to the workpiece is an important parameter of any welding process (fusion or friction stir welding). In fusion welding, measurement and control of heat input is a difficult problem. However, in friction stir welding, the basic principle of operation affords the potential of a straightforward solution: Neglecting thermal losses through the pin and the spindle that supports it, the rate of heat input to the workpiece is the product of the torque and the speed of rotation of the friction stir weld pin and, hence, of the spindle. Therefore, if one acquires and suitably processes data on torque and rotation and controls the torque, the rotation, or both, one should be able to control the heat input into the workpiece. In conventional practice in friction stir welding, one uses feedback control of the spindle motor to maintain a constant speed of rotation. According to the proposal, one would not maintain a constant speed of rotation: Instead, one would use feedback control to maintain a constant torque and would measure the speed of rotation while allowing it to vary. The torque exerted on the workpiece would be estimated as the product of (1) the torque-multiplication ratio of the <b>spindle</b> belt and/or <b>gear</b> drive, (2) the force measured by a load cell mechanically coupled to the spindle motor, and (3) the moment arm of the load cell. Hence, the output of the load cell would be used as a feedback signal for controlling the torque (see figure) ...|$|R
