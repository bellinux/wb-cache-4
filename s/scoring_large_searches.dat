Reverse-engineering approaches use text-search tools based on regular expressions or work on graph representations of programs, such as abstract syntax graphs. Analyzing large legacy systems often fail {{because of the}} <b>large</b> <b>search</b> space. Our approach to handle <b>large</b> <b>search</b> space in pattern-based reverse engineering is to allow imprecise results in means of false positives. We use the theory of fuzzy sets to express impreciseness and present our approach on the example of recovering associations. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Reinforcement {{learning}} has been repeatedly suggested as good candidate for learning in robotics. However, the <b>large</b> <b>search</b> spaces normally occurring robotics and expensive training experiences required by reinforcement learning algorithms has hampered its applicability. This paper introduces {{a new approach}} for reinforcement learning based on a relational representation which: (i) can be applied over <b>large</b> <b>search</b> spaces, (ii) can incorporate domain knowledge, and (iii) can use previously learned policies on different, although similar, problems. In the proposed framework states are represented as sets of first order relations, actions in terms of those relations, and policies are learned over such generalized representation. It is shown how this representation can capture <b>large</b> <b>search</b> spaces with a relatively small set of actions and states, and that policies learned over this generalized representation can be directly apply to other problems which can be characterized by {{the same set of}} relations. ...|$|R

30|$|It {{is known}} that a small search pattern with compactly spaced search points (SP) is more {{appropriate}} than a <b>large</b> <b>search</b> pattern containing sparsely spaced search points in detecting small motions [24]. On the contrary, the <b>large</b> <b>search</b> pattern {{has the advantage of}} quickly detecting large motions to avoid being trapped into local minimum along the search path and leads to unfavorable estimation, an issue that the small search pattern encounters. It is desirable to use different search patterns, that is, adaptive search patterns, in view of a variety of the estimated motion behaviors.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a hardware-efficient fast algorithm and its architecture for <b>large</b> <b>search</b> range motion estimation (ME) used in HDTV sized H. 264 video coding. To solve {{the high cost}} and latency in <b>large</b> <b>search</b> range case, the proposed algorithm processes ME in parallel multi-resolution levels instead of serial process in the previous approach. This enables high data reuse for lower bandwidth and low memory cost. Further combining with our previous proposed mode filtering and bit truncation, the algorithm only increases the bit rate within 1. 85 % and 2. 48 % and at most 0. 04 dB and 0. 05 dB PSNR degradation for 720 p and 1080 p sequences respectively. The hardware implementation can save up to 49. 5 % of area cost and 65 % of memory cost compared to the previous approach for <b>large</b> <b>search</b> range to [- 128, 127].

40|$|Abstract: Information {{retrieval}} {{system based on}} keyword searching deals with a very <b>large</b> <b>search</b> space as documents to be searched can be of any length and thus time to search in a whole document is also proportional to length of documents i. e. number of words in all documents. By reducing this <b>large</b> <b>search</b> space search time can also be reduced. In this paper we are proposing a method which reduces the search space {{with the help of}} indexing that uses concept of stemming and knowledge of stopwords. Indices are created for single terms and phrases both so that a single concept whether it is represented by a word or more than one word can be treated as required. Our search method uses ontology to incorporate domain knowledge while searching and thus improves the recall...|$|R
