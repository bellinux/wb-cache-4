40|$|The choice {{experiment}} elicitation format confronts {{survey respondents}} with repeated choice tasks. Particularly {{within the context}} of valuing pure public goods, this repetition raises two issues. First, does advanced awareness of multiple tasks influence stated preferences from the outset, and second, {{even in the absence of}} such awareness, does the process of working through a series of choice tasks influence stated preferences leading to choice outcomes that are dependent on the order in which a question is answered? The possible motivators of these effects include economic-theoretic reasons such as strategic behavior, as well as behavioral explanations such as response heuristics and learning effects. A case study of a familiar good (drinking water quality) combines a split sample treatment of the presence/absence of advanced awareness with a full factorial design permitting systematic variation of the order in which choices are presented to respondents. A further <b>sample</b> <b>division</b> allows examination of effects arising from variation in the scope of the initial good presented to respondents.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the factors that}} determine the worsening of intravenous glucose tolerance in subjects {{at high risk for}} developing non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), 15 glucose-tolerant offspring of NIDDM patients and 21 control subjects were studied. Each subject underwent a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance (FSIGT) test. The intravenous glucose tolerance index (K(G) index) was calculated between minutes 10 and 40 of a FSIGT test. Insulin sensitivity (S(I)), glucose effectiveness at zero insulin (GEZI), and first- and second-phase insulin responsiveness (phi 1 and phi 2) were estimated using glucose and insulin kinetic minimal models. The acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) was calculated as the area under the insulin curve above the basal level between 0 and 10 minutes, and the suprabasal insulin effect was determined by the product of S(I) times AIRg. Offspring had a lower S(I) than control subjects (14. 1 +/- 7. 5 v 9. 25 +/- 4. 20 x 10 (- 5) x min(- 1) (pmol x L(- 1)) (- 1), P <. 01), and their AIRg was similar (3, 284 +/- 2, 280 v 3, 105 +/- 1, 499 pmol x L(- 1), NS). <b>Sample</b> <b>division</b> according to the median K(G) value showed that control subjects with low tolerance had a lower AIRg (4, 417 +/- 2, 531 v 2, 043 +/- 1, 068 pmol x L(- 1), P <. 05) and a lower suprabasal insulin effect (0. 057 +/- 0. 03 v 0. 023 +/- 0. 009 min(- 1), P <. 05) than control subjects with high tolerance. Offspring with low tolerance had a lower AIRg (2, 574 +/- 1, 197 v 3, 707 +/- 1, 656 pmol x L(- 1), P <. 05) and a lower GEZI (0. 101 +/- 0. 05 v 0. 212 +/- 0. 08 x 10 (- 1) x min(- 1), P <. 05) than offspring with high tolerance.

40|$|Computer {{assisted}} {{language learning}} (CALL) comprises {{a wide range}} of information technologies that aim to broaden the context of teaching by getting advantages of IT. For example, a few efforts have been put on including a combination of voice and its visual representation for language learning, and some studies are reporting positive outcomes. However, more research is needed in order to assess the impact caused by specific visualization styles such as: highlighting syllables and/or wave of sound. In order to explore this issue, we focused at measuring the potential impact that two distinct visualization styles and its combination can have on teaching children the pronunciation of English as a second language. We built a prototype which was designed to assist students while learning pronunciation of syllables. This system was employing two different real-time interactive visualization styles. One of these visualization styles utilizes audio capturing and processing, using a recent technology development: Web Audio API. We evaluated the effect of our prototype with an experiment with children aged from 9 to 11 years old. We followed an experimental approach with a control group and three experimental groups. We tested our hypothesis that states that the use of a combined visualization style can have greater impact at learning pronunciation in comparison with traditional learning approach. Initial descriptive analyses were suggesting promising results for the group that used the combined visualization prototype. However, additional statistical analyses were carried out in order to measure the effect of prototype as accurately as possible within the constraints of our study. Further analyses provided evidence that our combined visualizations prototype has positively affected the learning of pronunciation. Nonetheless, the difference was not big comparing to the system that employed only wave of sound visualization. Ability to perceive visual information differs among individuals. Therefore, further research with different <b>sample</b> <b>division</b> is needed to determine whether is the combination of visualizations that does the effect, or is the wave in itself. Slitting groups based on this characteristic and perform the testing will be considered for the future research. Eventually, we can be confident to continue exploring further the possibility of integrating our proposed combination of two visualization styles in teaching practices of second language learning, due to positive outcomes that our current research outlined. In addition, from a technological perspective, our work is at the forefront of exploring the use of tools such as Web Audio API for CALL...|$|E

However, it is unclear how many needle passes should be performed and the amount of lung cancer cells that should be sent for molecular analyses. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if it is feasible to divide the material obtained by EBUS-TBNA to allow for molecular analysis without compromising the accuracy of mediastinal staging. Objective: We aimed to determine if dividing EBUS-TBNA specimens has a negative impact on either histopathological diagnosis or molecular analysis. Methods: EBUS-TBNA was performed in 249 enlarged lymph nodes. Negative or ambiguous histopathological results were confirmed by surgical means and clinical follow-up over 6 months. The tissue obtained by EBUS-TBNA was placed onto a glass slide and divided for histopathological workup and molecular analysis. The number of passes was recorded. Both the accuracy of the mediastinal lymph node staging and the applicability of the <b>sample</b> <b>division</b> for molecular analysis were assessed. Results: Each lymph node was punctured an average of 3. 18 times and division of the obtained material for diagnosis and molecular analysis was feasible in all cases. The sensitivity and accuracy of the mediastinal lymph node staging were 96. 6 % and 97. 6 %, respectively. A cytokeratin (CK) - 19 -mRNA concentration–based molecular test was feasible in 74. 1 % of cases. Conclusion: Dividing EBUS-TBNA samples for both histopathological diagnosis and molecular testing is feasible and does not compromise the accuracy of mediastinal staging. This method may be an alternative to taking additional needle passes for molecular analyses. Keywords: lung cancer, molecular marker, CK- 19 -mRNA, lymph node samplin...|$|E

We propose a novel sample split method, which benefits the learning results of articulated humans. We adopt the Cluster Boosted Tree (CBT) structure to automatically decide when a split should be triggered. Unlike the simple k-means used in CBT for sample split, our approach aims at minimizing the training loss after the split. Since this minimization is an NP-hard problem, we design a heuristic algorithm, in which we find optimal <b>sample</b> <b>divisions</b> according to each single feature, and then make compromises to get a final division by a voting-like process.

We conduct an experiment on 17 infrared surveillance video clips, report superior performance compared with previous human detection methods, and show how our approach benefits the learning results by reducing training loss. 1...|$|R

We also show that the approximation error component of the generalization error is lesser than when a single KRR estimate is fit on the data: thus providing both statistical and computational advantages over a single KRR estimate over the entire data (or an averaging over random partitions as in other recent work, [30]).

Retrospective data was used including 342 athletes from various sports such as: baseball, basketball, cross country, football, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. Sixty percent of the athletes were women (n= 206) and 40. 0 % were men (n= 132). Fat free mass (FFM) was hypothesized to increase with years of collegiate training. The secondary aim was to compare percent body fat (%BF) of these athletes to similar studies and textbook standards. All athletes were uninjured, actively participating, and {{between the ages of}} 18 - 24 years old. Body composition of each athlete was measured via BODPOD after appropriate preparation procedures and calibration took place. Data was stratified by subject identifier, gender, year of training, age, height, weight, sport, position, ethnicity, fat mass (FM), FFM, %BF, and percent fat free mass (%FFM). Statistical units used to determine outcomes were means, standard deviations, and ranges. Most positions were unable to be stratified into 4 individual years of training, but instead were evaluated using year 1 and the 4 -year average. Only six positions were stratified by gender, sport, position, and each individual year of training. No longitudinal data occurred in this study. When comparing {{the results of this study}} to similar studies found in literature or sports nutrition textbooks, the results were similar across gender, sport, and position. This cross-sectional descriptive study showed a positive association between FFM among women basketball guards, women soccer defenders, women track and field sprinters/middle distance/ hurdlers, and women volleyball outside/right side hitters with year of training. This study produced %BF values similar to those found in the literature and textbooks. Conclusions on the remaining women’s sports, positions, and men’s athletics were not possible due to small <b>samples.</b> <b>Division</b> I college athletes’ body composition did vary by gender, sport, and position due to different positional functions. Future studies with large samples of athletes tracked prospectively are needed to better describe body composition by position and years of training, and to assess body composition change longitudinally. ...|$|R
40|$|The Mehrabian and Hermans {{scales of}} {{resultant}} achievement mo-tivation {{were correlated with}} each other and with cumulative grade point average for three <b>samples</b> of lower <b>division</b> college males. In each sample, the two scales were significantly, but not highly, corre-lated (average r =. 31). The Hermans scale was consistently related to grade point average across samples. Significantly more accurate predictions of academic performance were obtained for lower fear of failure students and for students who perceived their present course grades as more important to their future career plans than for students who perceived present grades as less important to their future career plans...|$|R
