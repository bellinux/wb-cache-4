5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method {{under investigation}} is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl <b>sulfoxide,</b> into the vas deferens. An injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility. Another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the vas deferens to block it. A combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising, as do selective androgen receptor modulators. Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E
5|$|DMSO {{is widely}} used as an {{alternative}} to water because it has a lower dielectric constant than water, and is less polar and so dissolves non-polar, hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a measurable pKa range of about 1 to 30. Acetonitrile is less basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some pKa values at 25°C for acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl <b>sulfoxide</b> (DMSO) are shown in the following tables. Values for water are included for comparison.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} diaryl and {{alkylaryl}} sulfoxide-containing nitrogen mustards were synthesized and evaluated for their hypoxia-selective cytotoxicity against V- 79 cells in vitro {{as well as}} for their metabolism profiles with the rat S- 9 fractions. In general, the diaryl <b>sulfoxides</b> (4, 5, and 7 - 9) showed much greater hypoxia selectivity (11 - 27 -fold) than the alkylaryl <b>sulfoxides</b> (3 -fold) (1 and 3). The fused diphenyl <b>sulfoxides</b> (10 and 11), on the other hand, showed very low hypoxia selectivity (1. 3 - 3 -fold). Compound 10 was highly cytotoxic under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, while 11 showed low cytotoxicity under both conditions. The bioreduction of 8 by the rat S- 9 fraction under anaerobic conditions was inhibited by menadione and enhanced by benzaldehyde, acetaldehyde, or 2 -hydroxypyrimidine suggesting the involvement of aldehyde oxidase in the reduction of the <b>sulfoxides.</b> Bioreductive metabolism studies of selected model <b>sulfoxides</b> suggested that diaryl <b>sulfoxides</b> are better substrates for aldehyde oxidase than alkylaryl <b>sulfoxides...</b>|$|R

5|$|Selenium, {{especially}} in the II oxidation state, forms stable bonds to carbon, which are structurally analogous to the corresponding organosulfur compounds. Especially common are selenides (R2Se, analogues of thioethers), diselenides (R2Se2, analogues of disulfides), and selenols (RSeH, analogues of thiols). Representatives of selenides, diselenides, and selenols include respectively selenomethionine, diphenyldiselenide, and benzeneselenol. The <b>sulfoxide</b> in sulfur chemistry is represented in selenium chemistry by the selenoxides (formula RSe(O)R), which are intermediates in organic synthesis, {{as illustrated by the}} selenoxide elimination reaction. Consistent with trends indicated by the double bond rule, selenoketones, R(C=Se)R, and selenaldehydes, R(C=Se)H, are rarely observed.|$|E
5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl <b>sulfoxide,</b> and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium is a silvery-white shiny solid. It has a {{density of}} 6.24 g/cm3, is brittle, {{and is the}} softest of the {{commonly}} recognised metalloids, being marginally harder than sulfur.

Tellurium reacts with boiling water, or when freshly precipitated even at 50°C, to give the dioxide and hydrogen: Te + 2 H2O → TeO2 + 2 H2. It reacts (to varying degrees) with nitric, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids to give compounds such as the <b>sulfoxide</b> TeSO3 or tellurous acid H2TeO3, the basic nitrate (Te2O4H)+(NO3)−, or the oxide sulfate Te2O3(SO4). It dissolves in boiling alkalis, to give the tellurite and telluride: 3 Te + 6 KOH = K2TeO3 + 2 K2Te + 3 H2O, a reaction that proceeds or is reversible with increasing or decreasing temperature.|$|E

Their application as chiral synthons {{has now become a}} well-established and reliable strategy, mainly due to availability and high asymmetric induction exerted by the chiral sulfinyl group. Very few articles have been published on the separation of chiral sulfoxides; most involve HPLC or GC.

40|$|Abstract: The {{rates and}} {{mechanism}} of zinc chloride (Lewis acid) catalysed oxidation of several organic <b>sulfoxides</b> by permanganate {{have been studied}} in anhydrous acetone solutions. The kinetic rate law obtained indicates that a complex between permanganate and the Lewis acid (ZnCl 2) is formed before oxidation of the <b>sulfoxides</b> occurs. The function of the zinc chloride is to enhance the reactivity of permanganate. A Hammett ρ value of- 2. 1 8 ± 0. 09 is obtained for the oxidation of <b>sulfoxides</b> at 23. 0 0 C. A negative ρ value means that the sulfur is electron deficient in the transition state. Values for the HOMO energies of <b>sulfoxides</b> and the LUMO energies for permanganate ion and the permanganate-zinc chloride complex have been calculated.
