For a review of different quark mass definitions and their properties, see EL-KHADRA 02.

40|$|The {{bottom quark}} 1 <b>S</b> <b>mass,</b> M 1 <b>S</b> b, is {{determined}} using sum rules which relate the masses and the electronic decay widths of the Υ mesons to {{moments of the}} vacuum polarization function. The 1 <b>S</b> <b>mass</b> is defined as half the perturbative mass of a fictitious 3 S 1 bottom-antibottom quark bound state, and is free of the ambiguity of order ΛQCD which plagues the pole mass definition. Compared to an earlier analysis by the same author, which had been {{carried out in the}} pole mass scheme, the 1 <b>S</b> <b>mass</b> scheme leads to a much better behaved perturbative series of the moments, smaller uncertainties in the mass extraction and to a reduced correlation of the mass and the strong coupling. We arrive at M 1 S b = 4. 71 ± 0. 03 GeV taking αs(MZ) = 0. 118 ± 0. 004 as an input. From that we determine the MS mass as mb(mb) = 4. 20 ± 0. 06 GeV. The error in mb(mb) can be reduced if the three-loop corrections to the relation of pole and MS mass are known and if the error in the strong coupling is decreased...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of the}} {{conventional}} COD method to measure sulphide proved to be problematic due {{to the loss of}} hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) during sample handling. For calibration of models based on mass balances, and operation of full-scale systems, it was imperative to develop simple wet chemistry analytical procedures for the accurate measurement of parameters like sulphide, COD, alkalinities and VFA in order to monitor BSR systems and achieve 100 % COD and <b>S</b> <b>mass</b> balances. In this study, three different analytical methods were investigated to minimise the loss of undissociated H 2 S. Method 1 which is the recommended Standard Methods (1) COD test method resulted in poor <b>S</b> <b>mass</b> balance (64 - 75 %) due to loss of H 2 S during sample handling, mainly vacuum filtration. Method 2, in which 3 drops of 10 M NaOH are added immediately upon effluent sample collection to raise the pH to> 10 and converting undissociated H 2 S species into the HS- species resulted in minimal sulphide is lost during sample vacuum filtration, dilution, mixing and standing. Method 3, in which a polyelectrolyte is added to the effluent sample to coagulate the organic particles with centrifugation for solid-liquid separation instead of vacuum filtration. Results from Method 3 showed an improvement in the <b>S</b> <b>mass</b> balance wit...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} {{and performance of}} a choral-orchestral work can be a fulfilling musical experience. All too often, however, lack of interpretive interaction between the chorus and the orchestra frustrates an artistically successful outcome. This doctoral document presents a philosophy of preparation of choral-orchestral works that promotes the working together of the choral-orchestral ensemble. ^ The author of the document considers choral, orchestral, and choral-orchestral rehearsal techniques that create synergy in the choral-orchestral ensemble an essential tool to optimize choral-orchestral renditions. The rehearsal techniques are described and are applied to the author 2 ̆ 7 s {{preparation and}} performance of Schubert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Mass</b> in G. Although offering {{a detailed analysis of}} the work, as well as reflections on its preparation, this document is not a 2 ̆ 2 Conductor 2 ̆ 7 s Guide to Schubert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Mass</b> in G. 2 ̆ 2 Rather, the intent of the author is to provide an approach to choral-orchestral preparation which can inspire conductors to create their own rehearsal techniques that form synergy in the choral-orchestral ensemble, and to apply them to their preparation of works from the vast choral-orchestral repertoire. ^ Also included in this document are a survey of selected English-language scholarly literature on preparation of choral-orchestral works, and a DVD containing a performance of Schubert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Mass</b> in G conducted by the author. ...|$|R
