5000|$|A nationally {{recognized}} statistical rating organization (NRSRO) is a credit rating agency (CRA) that issues credit ratings that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits other financial firms {{to use for}} certain regulatory purposes. Originally, seven rating agencies were recognized as NRSROs, a number that dwindled {{as a result of}} mergers to six by the mid-1990s and then to three by 2003. [...] As of March 2015, ten organizations were designated as NRSROs.Ratings by NRSROs are used for a variety of regulatory purposes in the United States. In addition to net capital requirements (described in more detail below), the SEC permits certain bond issuers to use a <b>shorter</b> <b>prospectus</b> <b>form</b> when issuing bonds if the issuer is older, has issued bonds before, and has a credit rating above a certain level. SEC regulations also require that money market funds (mutual funds that mimic the safety and liquidity of a bank savings deposit, but without U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance) comprise only securities with a very high rating from an NRSRO. Likewise, insurance regulators use credit ratings from NRSROs to ascertain the strength of the reserves held by insurance companies.|$|R

All <b>short</b> <b>forms</b> showed good reliability coefficients.

40|$|Aim. The {{present study}} aimed at {{examining}} the factorial {{structure of the}} Chinese version of the State Anxiety Scale (<b>Short</b> <b>form),</b> using exploratory and confirmatory analyses. Background. The factorial structure of the <b>short</b> <b>form</b> of the Chinese version of the State Anxiety Scale for Children has neither been examined by using exploratory factor analysis nor been examined by confirmatory factor analysis. Consequently, whether {{the factor structure of}} the <b>short</b> <b>form</b> is congruent with the hypothesised configuration of the factor structure of the full form cannot be confirmed. Design. Survey. Method. A test-retest, within-subjects design was employed. Two hundred children (7 - 12 years of age) admitted for surgery in a day surgery unit was {{invited to participate in the}} study. They were asked to respond to the Chinese version of the State Anxiety Scale (<b>short</b> <b>form)</b> before surgery and upon discharge home. Results. The results of exploratory factor analysis showed that there are two factors underlying the <b>short</b> <b>form,</b> which is congruent with hypothesised configuration of the factor structure of the full form. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the construct validity, with a good fit between the factor structure of the <b>short</b> <b>form</b> and the observed data. Conclusion. This study addressed a gap in the literature by examining the factorial structure of the <b>short</b> <b>form.</b> The results confirmed the factor structure of the <b>short</b> <b>form</b> is congruent with the hypothesised configuration of the factor structure of the full form. Relevance to clinical practice. The availability of a valid, reliable and convenient instrument is crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of nursing interventions. The findings also suggest that the <b>short</b> <b>form</b> is an objective assessment tool and can be used by clinical nurses as objective assessment tool in measuring anxiety level of Chinese children in busy clinical settings, where time constraints make the use of the full form unfeasible. © 2008 The Authors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
