30|$|The <b>SAPHO</b> (synovitis–acne–pustulosis–hyperostosis–osteitis) <b>syndrome</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} by the rheumatologist Chamot in 1987, and it {{is characterized by a}} combination of skin and osteoarticular manifestations. The term attempts to comprise numerous names that have been used in the literature for the last 50  years, describing the above-mentioned characteristics. Some of those names are bilateral clavicular osteomyelitis with palmar and plantar pustulosis, inter-sterno-costo-clavicular ossification, subacute and chronic symmetric osteomyelitis, arthro-osteitis associated with a follicular occlusive triad, sternoclavicular hyperostosis, nonbacterial osteitis, pustulotic arthro-osteitis, chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO), Koehler’s disease, pyogenic sterile arthritis, acquired hyperostosis syndrome, or spondyloarthritis hyperostotica pustulo-psoriatica [1, 2, 3, 4]. CRMO will be discussed more in detail in this review as well, due to the great confusion that these two terms generate in the literature. Numerous authors have suggested that CRMO and SAPHO lie along the same clinical spectrum. Some believe that CRMO is the pediatric presentation of SAPHO, even though there are some rare descriptions of SAPHO seen in children and seldom in adolescents, as well as descriptions of CRMO in adults. It seems that the differentiating clinical feature is mainly in the localization of inflammation: in pediatric CRMO, the extremities are more often affected, whereas in SAPHO, the axial skeleton with costosternoclavicular region is the focus [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].|$|R
40|$|Autoinflammatory {{diseases}} are {{a group of}} disorders characterized by recurrent unprovoked inflammatory events in absence of autoantibodies or autoreatcive T cells. At least eight forms are well characterized: 1) Familial Mediteranean Fever (FMF), 2) hypergammaglobulinemia D with periodic fever (HIDS), 3) tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), 4) Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), 5) familial cold autoinflammatroy syndrome (FCAS), 6) chronica infantile neurologic cutaneous articular (CINCA) syndrome, 7) Pyogenic sterile Arthritis, Pyoderma gangrenosum and Acne syndrome (PAPA) and 8) Blau syndrome. Recently also Schnitzler and SAPHO (Synovitis Acne Pustolosis Hyperostosis Osteitis) syndromes {{have been added to}} the list. With the exception of FMF these disorders are rare. In many of these diseases there is a fundamental alteration in the IL- 1 (FCAS, MWS, CINCA, HIDS, FMF, PAPA) or TNF pathway (TRAP). Recent advances in molecular genetics of FACS, MWS and CINCA have led to the identification of the likely cause of deregulated IL- 1 secretion. Processing and release of IL- 1  occur in a macromolecular complex termed inflammasome which includes the proteins the proteins ASC, NALP 3, Caspase- 1 and Cardinal. The mechanism of inflammasome activation is obscure. However, it is well known that extracellular ATP is the most potent physiological activator so far identified. Extracellular ATP-mediated activation of caspase- 1 occurs via a receptor named P 2 X 7 (P 2 X 7 R). Mice deficient of constituents of the inflammasome (es ASC) are unresponsive to P 2 X 7 R-mediated stimulation but molecular link between P 2 X 7 R and inflammasome has not been elucidated. Here we have investigated the role of the P 2 X 7 R and of the inflammasome components ASC and NALP 3 in the pathogenesis of Schnitzler and <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndromes.</b> The results show that PBMCs from Schnitzler patients present a defective pathway of IL- 1 ß processing and secretion which allows substantial IL- 1 ß release also in the absence of the “second hit” usually required. Therapies aimed at normalizing inflammasome function might help to correct the unbalanced IL- 1 ß secretion typical of this <b>syndrome.</b> In the <b>SAPHO</b> patient a deregulation of the extracellular ATP-dependent P 2 X 7 -IL- 1 ß axis is suggested, that prompted to begin treatment with the interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra) anakinra (100 mg/day). The blockade of IL- 1 signalling had a sustained effect, with remission of signs and symptoms and normalization of acute phase markers. The dosage of anakinra was then gradually reduced and the patient is still symptom-free. In any case, since a positive response to anti-TNFα agents has also been observed, the precise pathogenetic role of IL- 1 β and TNFα is a matter for further investigations...|$|R

5000|$|Chronic {{recurrent}} multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) ("multifocal" [...] {{because it}} can erupt in different sites, primarily bones; [...] "osteomyelitis" [...] because it {{is very similar to}} that disease but appears to be without any infection), also known as chronic recurring multifocal osteomyelitis, is a rare condition (1:1,000,000), in which the bones have lesions, inflammation, and pain. Its definition is evolving. Many doctors and articles described CRMO as an autoimmune disease that has symptoms similar to osteomyelitis, but without the infection. Some doctors thought CRMO was related to <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Research now classifies CRMO as an inherited autoinflammatory disease but have yet to isolate the exact gene responsible for it. Some specialists believe they have discovered a link between CRMO with a rare allele of marker D18S60, resulting in a haplotype relative risk (HRR) of 18.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Synovitis-acne-pustulosis-hyperostosis-osteitis (<b>SAPHO)</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is a rare}} disorder. The {{etiology}} {{remains unknown}} and the treatment is still empirical. Synovitis {{is one of the}} major manifestations, but information on histopathological features is still lacking. In this case, we investigated the histopathological features of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> synovitis. Case presentation We present the case of a 53 -year-old Japanese woman with <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> accompanied by marked knee synovitis and palmoplantar pustulosis. We found abundant sterile joint fluid in the right knee, and a blood test showed abnormally high values of C-reactive protein (17. 26 mg/dl) and matrix metalloproteinase- 3 (800 ng/ml). Arthroscopic surgery revealed marked proliferation of villous synovial tissues similar to rheumatoid arthritis and standard microscopic findings were also similar to rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, for the first time, we demonstrated by immunohistochemistry the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) converting enzyme, TNF-α and matrix metalloproteinase- 3 in the proliferated synovial lining cells. After arthroscopic synovectomy, her knee symptoms immediately diminished and laboratory data (matrix metalloproteinase- 3 and C-reactive protein) normalized within 2 weeks of surgery. Conclusion We demonstrate the expression of TNF-α converting enzyme, TNF-α and matrix metalloproteinase- 3 in <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> synovitis for the first time and also show, both macro- and microscopically, the similarity between <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> and rheumatoid arthritis synovitis. These new findings support the recently reported successful treatment of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> with antirheumatic drugs, especially with anti-TNF-α agents. </p...|$|E
40|$|The <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{characterized}} by specific clinical manifestations of synovitis, acne pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis. It is a rare disease {{with a combination of}} osseous and articular manifestations associated with skin lesions. We describe a patient with <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> of the mandible and involvement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ ankylosis). The findings from orthopantomography, computed tomography (CT), and clinical and histopathological examinations are compared and analyzed to improve the final diagnosis. Our patient was submitted to a bilateral high condylectomy and coronoidectomy to correct the open mouth limitation. No previous report of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> associated with secondary TMJ ankylosis was found in the literature...|$|E
40|$|The <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{represents}} {{a variety of}} clinically similar disorders with the key features of hyperostotic bone lesions in combination with chronic pustular skin disease. The respective pathophysiology of bone and joint manifestations in <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> is still a matter of discussion. For example {{it does not appear}} to represent reactive arthritis and HLA B 27 antigen, with the latter being typically present in patients with spondyloarthopathies. Treatment of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> is also not well established and consists of various antiinflammatory and antirheumatic drugs. Here, we report a female patient with active <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> suffering from sternal swelling of unknown origin that had been known for 10 years and a 4 -year-history of severe lower back pain. Remarkable were also a typical pustulous palmar erythema associated with swelling and decreased motility of both MCP-I joints. Inflammation parameters were high with an ESR 68 mm/ 1 st hour and a CRP of 19. 6 mg/l. She was initially treated with rofecoxib and doxycycline, followed by sulfasalazine with only partial clinical response. Thereafter, both articular symptoms as well as cutaneous lesions responded well to a combination therapy with methotrexate and sulfasalazine. Thus, the case illustrates nicely that methotrexate in combination with another DMARD can be successfully applied to patients with long-term active <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|E

40|$|Summary: We {{report a}} case of {{arthritis}} of the temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) associated with sclerosing osteo-myelitis of the mandible and temporal bone, causing deaf-ness. The presence of a palmoplantar pustulosis established the diagnosis of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome.</b> SAPHO (an acronym referring to synovitis, acne, palmoplantar pustulosis, hy-perostosis, and osteitis) syndrome {{is defined by the}} associ-ation of characteristic osteoarticular and dermatologic manifestations, with diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis of the mandible being a part of this entity. We review the liter-ature of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> with mandibular manifesta-tions and discuss the mechanisms of inflammatory spread from the TMJ to the cochlea.

40|$|AbstractEven though {{increasing}} {{knowledge is}} emerging about synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis (<b>SAPHO)</b> <b>syndrome</b> its pathogenesis remains enigmatic. Women are preferentially affected by <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Here we present {{the case of}} a 39 -year-old woman suffering from this syndrome whose bone involvement was first interpreted as diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis of the mandible. As treatment with clindamycin did not improve the symptoms, {{the decision was made to}} administer bisphosphonates intravenously. This treatment led to a rapid improvement in symptoms, which could be explained by the apparent tendency of bisphosphonates to exert a positive effect on the jaw. With this case report we attempt to offer an explanation for the influence of this group of medications on patients suffering from <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> with mandibular involvement...|$|E

P. acnes is not often found in bone lesions of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome.</b> A bone biopsy may represent a procedure useful for corroborating the diagnosis or for excluding other diseases only in specific cases...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, {{hyperostosis}} and osteitis) is a {{rare disease}} combining skin, bone and joint manifestations. In recent years new therapeutic strategies have been tried, among them TNF-alpha-blocking agents. We report our experience with infliximab in four cases of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> refractory to conventional therapies. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2005, four cases of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> (two females and two males; mean age 49. 7 yr) responding poorly to conventional drugs were treated with infliximab. The dose was 5 mg/kg, according to the protocol used in spondyloarthropathies, with infusions at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by 6 weeks intervals. No active cutaneous manifestations were present {{at the time of}} starting therapy. RESULTS: Complete remission of osteoarticular involvement was achieved after the second or third infusion, and the positive response was maintained for up to 12 months. A patient relapsed after discontinuation of infliximab, because of infectious complication. Palmoplantaris pustulosis relapsed in two patients after three and six infusions, respectively; there was slight improvement after discontinuation of anti-TNF-alpha drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab seems to be a very effective therapy for osteoarticular complaints of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Cutaneous involvement responded less favourably, palmoplantaris pustulosis relapse being a possible complication...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{review the}} epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, treatment, pathogenesis, and {{genetics}} of the syndrome known under the acronym of SAPHO for Synovitis, Acne, Pustulosis, Hyperostosis, and Osteitis to heighten awareness of this entity. MethodsWe conducted a Medline search using <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome,</b> chronic recurrent multifocal osteitis/osteomyelitis, and related terms as keywords and extracted further relevant articles from the retrieved references. ResultsThe SAHPO acronym identifies a syndrome encompassing {{a variety of}} osteoarticular disorders that are frequently accompanied by dermatoses characterized by neutrophilic pseudoabscesses, but can also occur in isolation. <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> is rare, although probably underrecognized because its diagnosis may be challenging because of the wide variability in its musculoskeletal and cutaneous manifestations. This is especially true when atypical sites are involved and when specific skin lesions are absent. There are no standardized treatment protocols available. Current treatments are empirical and {{have the objective of}} providing relief from the at times debilitating pain associated with <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome.</b> They include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics as first-line agents. Systemic corticosteroids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, biologicals targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin- 1, and bisphosphonates have all been beneficial in some patients, but ineffective in others. This suggests that the pathogenesis of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> is multifactorial, but this aspect remains poorly explored, although bacteria and immunological dysfunction are hypothesized to play a role. ConclusionsThe early recognition, diagnosis, and prompt treatment of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> can prevent the unnecessary use of long-term antibiotics or invasive procedures, while rapidly alleviating pain in a majority of affected patients...|$|E

Symptoms recurred and a lesion were again detected on radiological follow-up, but improvement occurred following treatment with antibiotics and biphosphonate, achieving a low inflammatory activity, reduction in CNS lesions and relative clinical well-being. This is a first report in literature about {{the central nervous system}} involvement in a patient with <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the article by Zhao et al., 1 recently published in The Journal of Dermatology, regarding an emblematic case of synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis (<b>SAPHO)</b> <b>syndrome.</b> We fully agree with Zhao et al., both {{on the importance of}} an early diagnosis and on the detrimental consequences of a delayed diagnosis on various aspects of quality of life. In 1987, Chamot and Kahn suggested the acronym SAPHO in order to unify various conditions characterized mainly by the variable association of osteitic ⁄ hyperostotic lesions of the anterior chest wall (ACW) and several skin disorders, such as palmoplantar pustulosis,severe acne and hidradenitis suppurativa. Less commonly described are Sneddon–Wilkinson disease and other neutrophilic dermatoses, namely Sweet syndrome and pyoderma gangrenosum. Inclusion of psoriasis vulgaris as the only skin lesion is still being discussed and should be considered only in patients with a typical sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis. 2 We also agree with Zhao et al. that <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> could be underestimated because the cutaneous lesions may be transient, or also absent. Skin manifestations usually precede the onset of osteoarticular complaints, therefore an effort for greater awareness of the ACW pain syndromes is needed among dermatologists. The nosological framing of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> is still a matter of debate. Although it has repeatedly been related to the spondyloarthropathy family, emerging evidence suggests that <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> could be a primitive inflammatory osteitis, probably related to polygenic auto-inflammatory disorders. Our previous finding of a dysregulation of the extracellular adenosine triphosphate-dependent P 2 X 7 –IL 1 b axis in a case of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> effectively treated with the interleukin (IL) - 1 receptor antagonist anakinra seems to suggest that <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{should be included in the}} growing family of polygenic auto-inflammatory disorders. 3 Different stimuli have been implicated as possible inciting factors, in particular Propionibacterium acnes, either alive or as dead antigen. 4 So far, our work, previously published in Arthritis Care & Research, represents the largest published series since the 1980 s, with a median follow-up duration of 11 years. 5 In agreement with Zhao et al., we found that the course of the disease was variable. In particular, nine patients presented with a limited course lasting less than 6 months but more than 3 months, with a single episode that afterward faded away. In these subjects, no disease flares occurred during a median follow up of 8 years. In 25 cases, after a first, limited course of less than 6 months, the patients experienced multiple remissions and exacerbations. In these patients, the duration of the flares was 2 – 8 months and they did not demonstrate any apparent periodicity or recurrence. Thirty-seven patients, representing 52 % of our series, had a chronic course characterized by fluctuating intermittent periods of exacerbations and short improvements, requiring almost continuous treatment. We also demonstrated that female sex, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein values, ACW involvement, peripheral synovitis, and the occurrence of two or more skin lesions at the onset are associated with a chronic course. In conclusion, we agree that diagnostic delays are important and that early recognition of <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> is of great importance. Therefore, as Zhao et al. affirmed, we firmly hope that nonrheumatological specialists, such as dermatologists, but also general practitioners and internists, will have greater confidence in recognizing this condition...|$|E
30|$|Whether the <b>SAPHO</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{represents}} a clinical entity by itself, {{should be considered}} a subset within the family of spondyloarthropathies (due to the frequent affliction of the axial skeleton, enthesitis, and inflammatory bowel diseases), or be considered a variant of another rheumatic disease (i.e., psoriatic arthritis) is still unknown [2].|$|E
