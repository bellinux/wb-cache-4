5000|$|Dyũta samāhvaya, {{known as}} 'gambling and betting games,' is a {{traditional}} title of dispute first present in the earlier smŗtis with little change in the post smŗti period. The Mitāksarā {{is one of the}} only texts that presents a change, defining gambling as [...] "any transaction involving betting with stake money" [...] thus expanding the definition beyond games like dice and cockfighting. [...] According to Mathur, Manu's categorical command to the kings to completely prohibit all gambling influences many texts like the Vyavahāra Nirņaya and the Smŗti Candrikā. These texts reflect no desirability in having any law allowing gambling. However, there are other texts like the Bŗhaspati that find gambling law to be beneficial for purposes of taxation and to provide ease in the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>criminals.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "There {{is little}} {{authority}} in English law concerning {{the rights and}} duties {{of a member of}} the armed forces of the Crown when acting in aid of the civil power; and what little authority there is relates almost entirely to the duties of soldiers when troops are called upon to assist in controlling a riotous assembly. Where used for such temporary purposes it may not be inaccurate to describe the rights and duties of a soldier as being no more than those of an ordinary citizen in uniform. But such a description is in my view misleading in the circumstances in which the army is currently employed in aid of the civil power in Northern Ireland. In theory it may be the duty of every citizen when an arrestable offence is about to be committed in his presence to take whatever reasonable measures are available to him to prevent the commission of the crime; but the duty is one of imperfect obligation and it does not place him under any obligation to do anything by which he would expose himself to risk of personal injury, nor is he under any duty to <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>criminals</b> or seek out crime. In contrast to this a soldier who is employed in aid of the civil power in Northern Ireland is under a duty, enforceable under military law, to <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>criminals</b> if so ordered by his superior officer and to risk his own life should this be necessary in preventing terrorist acts. For the performance of this duty he is armed with a firearm, a self-loading rifle, from which a bullet, if it hits the human body, is almost certain to cause serious injury if not death." ...|$|E

40|$|Investigation of stains from {{crime scenes}} are {{commonly}} used in the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>criminals.</b> At The National Laboratory of Forensic Science, where these stains are examined, {{a number of questions}} of theoretical and practical interest regarding the databases of DNA profiles and the strength of DNA evidence against a suspect in a trial are not fully investigated. The first part of this thesis deals with how a sample of DNA profiles from a population is used in the process of estimating the strength of DNA evidence in a trial, taking population genetic factors into account. We then consider how to combine hypotheses regarding the relationship between a suspect and other possible donors of the stain from the crime scene by two applications of Bayes’ theorem. After that we assess the DNA profiles that minimize the strength of DNA evidence against a suspect, and investigate how the strength is affected by sampling error using the bootstrap method and a Bayesian method. In {{the last part of the}} thesis we examine discrepancies between different databases of DNA profiles by both descriptive and inferential statistics, including likelihood ratio tests and Bayes factor tests. Little evidence of major differences is found...|$|E
40|$|Room clearing, {{in which}} {{building}} surveillance is conducted to <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>criminals,</b> {{continues to be}} a dangerous and difficult problem in urban settings, for both the military as well as for police. In a typical setting, an unknown number of hostile forces may be located in a building, and they may be armed. Furthermore, there may be innocent civilians. The goal of the friendly units is to enter the room and secure it, but without loss of life of friendly forces, hostile forces, and most especially of innocent civilians. It would be beneficial to allow robots {{to be a part of}} the friendly team, however it is very challenging to have robots that do not either slow down or obstruct their human teammate. This is especially difficult since nearly all robots in use by the military and police today are tele-operated. In this paper, we describe work we have developed in cooperation with the army, for the room clearing domain. We constructed an algorithm whereby multiple agents, in the form of robots, can accomplish a room clearing task. We augmented the agent algorithms to introduce Adjustable Autonomy, allowing cooperation with humans. We describe simulated results of the algorithm on building maps, and furthermore we describe how we intend to next conduct hardware tests, and eventual plans to field the system. This agent-based solution has great potential to increase the acceptance and leverage of robotics in complex environments...|$|E
40|$|The ultra-wideband (UWB) is a radio {{technology}} {{which can be}} used at very low energy levels for short-range high-bandwidth communications by using {{a large portion of the}} radio spectrum. In February 2002, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) gave the permission for UWB to be used for imaging and radar production. The corresponding technology is continuing to be developed furthermore, especially the radar applications of life detection. In various situations, the life-detection system for vital parameter detection is a highly useful and important application. It can be used to search for living objects in collapsed buildings after an earthquake or trapped in buildings on fire, or avalanche victims. It can also be used to monitor patients in clinics or at home where it can provide remote measurements of the parameters of a patient's vital activity without having contact with them. In addition, it can be used by law-enforcement services to <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>criminals</b> hiding behind various covers. Consequently, there is a growing demand for remote monitoring appliances of human life detector systems. Unfortunately, most of those researches about life detection do not report that there arise four problems in practical situations. The first problem is that most of the articles also do not describe whether their researches could be used for an automatic system or not. The second problem is the error from obstacle effects. The third problem is that the chest movement is not fixed. The fourth problem is the different intensity of a human chest movement. Those are very important points to take into account especially in rescue operations. The challenges mentioned above are fulfilled with the system presented in this work. The UWB radar setup consists of a sub-nanosecond pulse generator, two wideband antennas and two low noise amplifiers. For a fast, robust and accurate algorithm, digital low pass filters are used to remove the background noise. The effect of human breath on the received signal is computed using the unbiased variance. This method is successful to find the expected data behind the noise. The FIR filtering is used to get the peak and interprets it as the position of a human being. Using the magnitude cycle rate with various numbers of averaged points, the breath frequency is determined easily. The more points used, the closer the frequency is to the real values. The system is used to perform one- and two-dimensional measurements for the position and breath frequency of a person behind a wall. The whole measurement times are less than 12 and 42 seconds respectively. It is also robust against multipath and jamming. The development of a reference breath simulator has been successful to achieve the characteristics of breathing at different angles. These results could be used for rescue operations to find persons quickly. Two setups would complete the sensitive angles. The system could also be used for medical measurement of patients in hospital or at home to get stable life data...|$|E

50|$|For certain situations, the {{law says}} that safe {{identification}} is needed, without saying how it should done.

When the police are <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>criminals</b> expected to have a car, they organise speeding checks or sobriety checks, since they are allowed to randomly ask for id only in this situation. <b>Searches</b> <b>for</b> illegal immigrants are often done in cooperation with guards checking local traffic tickets.

50|$|In March 1825, the Gallinipper was {{accompanied}} by the frigate HMS Dartmouth and the schooners HMS Lion and HMS Union in an operation against Cuban pirates. United States Navy Lieutenant Isaac McKeever commanded and led an attack against a pirate schooner {{at the mouth of}} the Sagua la Grande River. American and British forces took the ship, killed eight outlaws and captured nineteen others with the loss of only one man wounded. On the following day, another schooner was captured but the pirates escaped and the vessel was taken without bloodshed. This mission was one of the first joint operations conducted by British and American forces. Famed pirate Roberto Cofresí was defeated on March 2, by the USS Grampus and two Spanish sloops off Boca del Infierno. Cofresi was considered the last Caribbean pirate to be successful.
