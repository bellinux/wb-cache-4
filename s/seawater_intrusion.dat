5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; <b>seawater</b> <b>intrusion</b> in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{demographic}} {{explosion of}} many volcanic islands, with associated increasing drinking water needs, requires detailed investigation of their subsurface {{in order to}} provide sustainable solutions and for an adapted management of groundwater resources. In this context, hydrogeological studies are challenging due to difficulties in accessing the study sites (steep slopes, dense vegetation and a limited access), and to the geological complexity of volcanic deposits (lateral and vertical lithological variability with superimposed intense weathering). Furthermore, there are often few boreholes enabling detailed hydrogeological characterizations, which limit the detailed validation of the different approaches and methods. The SkyTEM dual-moment Time Domain Electromagnetic system was used {{for the first time in}} a volcanic context in 2006 over the Galapagos Islands by UPMC-Sorbonne University and Aarhus University, then by BRGM in 2009 over Mayotte Island (with Aarhus University as partner), in 2013 over Martinique and Guadeloupe Islands (Lesser Antilles) and in 2014 over Reunion Island. The SkyTEM helicopter-borne TDEM system allows detailed mapping of the internal geological structure of the upper 200 m of these volcanic islands, through a quasi- 3 D resistivity model. Based on a literature review, the main contribution of this SkyTEM method to volcanic island hydrogeology will be presented. In this context, this method: (i) could help to highlight the main geological structures, playing key roles on the hydrogeological functioning of such islands even on a complex geologic context, and (ii) allows identification of <b>seawater</b> <b>intrusions</b> and depth of saltwater interface. For instance, the presence of a perched aquifer, potentially strategic for the island water supply, is suspected on Santa Cruz Island and confirmed on San Cristobal (Galapagos Archipelago). On these islands, <b>seawater</b> <b>intrusions</b> are typical of Hawaiian model basal aquifer. On Mayotte Island, influences of successive phases of volcanic construction and erosion, and consequently structural controls on groundwater flows have been highlighted. At a smaller scale a buried valley also clearly plays a key role on the hydrogeological functioning in the south of the island. <b>Seawater</b> <b>intrusions</b> here are clearly different from Galapagos Island and don't penetrate far inland. In Martinique islands, preliminary results are also promising...|$|R

While much of this ExNa was lixiviated with the rainwater washes, the soil exhibited significant remaining exchangeable sodium percentages (ESP). Consequences of the residual ESP after intensive washings were exhibited in the enhanced dispersiveness (i. e., increased settling time) of the soil colloids.

The success of a particular time-lapse inversion scheme depends on the validity of several assumptions made by these inversion schemes. Difference inversion schemes generally assume that part of the noise contained in the data cancels out when working with temporal data differences. Process-based inversion requires a more advanced knowledge of the system prior the inversion. Temporally-constrained inversion on the other hand assumes that the changes are localized and minor. We show in this paper using data sets with different time and spatial scales, and with different degrees of geological complexity and resistivity contrasts, that the particular success of a time-lapse inversion scheme is highly dependent on the temporal behaviour of the noise estimation in the time-lapse data set and of the model-dependent resolution pattern of the survey.

Israel sells a limited part of the water to the Palestinians in Gaza.

The present study aimed at evaluating the effects of salinisation on soil ecosystems due to sea level rise. The reproduction and mortality of three standard soil invertebrate species (Folsomia candida, Enchytraeus crypticus, Hypoaspis aculeifer) in standard artificial OECD soil spiked with serial dilutions of seawater/gradient of NaCl were evaluated according to standard guidelines.

The exploitation of the coastal aquifer has resulted in continuous lowering of regional water levels and the worsening of water quality. The greatest threats to existing water supplies are <b>seawater</b> <b>intrusions</b> and up coning of deep brine fossil water. There are serious water quality problems in the Gaza Strip Aquifer.

40|$|Inorganic arsenic {{has been}} widely used during the {{production}} cycle of fertilizers and pesticides and leakage into subsoils and shallow groundwater {{has been reported in}} the recent literature. Despite of this, most of the scientific papers have focused on natural arsenic mobilization and geochemical cycling in the subsurface. Since the arsenic mobilization is usually driven by redox processes, pH changes and ionic strength of the water, it is of foremost importance to study its behavior in coastal aquifers where all of these factors essentially coincide. The study site is a former fertilizer plant located near the shore line in Italy, where a pump and treat remediation scheme has been active since 2001. A detailed characterization of arsenic in groundwater was performed to elucidate the mobilization/immobilization mechanisms actually occurring at the site. It was found that most of the arsenic was entrapped in the sediments located near to the source zone, while phosphorous (mainly phosphate) migrated further downstream. A marked vertical reverse trend of EC and Eh was found within the aquifer: the elevated EC was due to the <b>seawater</b> wedge <b>intrusion</b> enhanced by pumping wells, while anoxic conditions were due to organic matter oxidation by sulphate provided by seawater. The arsenic speciation in groundwater showed the net predominance of As(III) except in the upper portion of the aquifer, where post-oxic condition occurred due to continuous oxygen exchange with the vadose zone. In the deeper portion of the aquifer the As(III) concentrations increased up to 900 μg/l, while As(V) remained stable. This feature was probably due to the elevated ionic strength of deep groundwater, which can displace weakly bonded oxianions from exchange sites and also by reducing conditions which promoted As(III) mobilization. Phosphate was present almost only in groundwater due to the reducing conditions of the aquifer. This characterization confirmed that two different mechanisms for arsenic fate were active: (i) the oxidation and consequent sequestration in the upper oxidized zone, near the water table, with a marked decrease of total arsenic in groundwater with respect to the aquifer bottom, where (ii) the reduced and salinized conditions gave rise to very high arsenic concentrations with As(III) as the main groundwater species...|$|R

Two large-scale geochemical sampling programs were undertaken to investigate the spatial distribution of saline groundwater and to describe the geochemical evolution of groundwater in the fractured aquifer systems. Major ion chemistry indicates that cation exchange between calcium-rich waters and sodium-rich sites complicates a simple mixing trend, and saline waters appear to represent mixing either between fresh type (calcium bicarbonate) groundwater and <b>seawater</b> (recent saltwater <b>intrusion)</b> or sodium-rich groundwater and seawater (resident saline waters).

40|$|Les eaux souterraines qui représentent les seules {{ressources}} en eau de la Chaouia côtière, sont très minéralisées : intrusion marine, évaporation et recyclage des eaux d'irrigation chargées en sels. L'évolution spatio-temporelle piézométrique et hydrochimique de cet aquifère a été observée sur 179 puits, de 1991 à 1998 qui inclue une période exceptionnellement pluvieuse. Une comparaison {{par rapport}} à l'état de la nappe en 1971, date du début de l'exploitation des eaux souterraines, a été faite. Les suivis ont montré qu'à la suite des pluies importantes de 1996 (943 mm), un rehaussement important du niveau de la nappe et des dilutions plus ou moins retardées de tous les sels en solution dans l'eau, sont mesurés dans tous les puits. En effet, la nappe qui a accusé des baisses de 10 à 20 m entre 1971 et 1995, remonte en 1996 de 4, 5 à 12, 5 m en moyenne surtout au centre et à l'amont de la plaine. Quant à la qualité des eaux qui s'était dégradée, elle a connu des améliorations importantes avec des variations de 0, 5 à plus de 4 ms/cm {{au niveau de}} la conductivité électrique. Ces faits montrent une grande sensibilité de la nappe aux apports par les pluies qui constituent sa principale alimentation. A study of regional pollution in the coastal aquifer system between Oum-er-Rbia River and Bir Jdid (Coastal Moroccan Meseta, Morocco) was based on data gathered from 1995 to 1998. The study improved the hydrogeological and hydrochemical understanding of the aquifers. The study {{examined the effects of}} significant rains on {{the quantity and quality of}} coastal groundwater. These waters exhibited high sensitivity to the rain input. Measurements undertaken since 1991 on 179 wells in the study area reveal that the groundwaters are highly mineralized - conductivity reaches more than 10 mS/cm, depending on season and well location. These results also show high chloride concentrations (more than 3500 mg/l), sodium concentrations frequently in the 500 - 1000 mg/l range and nitrates between 150 and 250 mg/l. In coastal Chaouia, these high concentrations of dissolved mineral salts aggravate the problem of supplying quality water to the rural population for drinking or even market-gardening irrigation purposes. The area is characterized by increased irrigated surfaces (more than 16000 hectares with 4125 m 3 /s) and a demographic rise that has triggered the chaotic boring of more than 2000 wells into a heterogeneous aquifer sensitive to salinity. Possible sources of this high salinity include :Seawater intrusion into coastal aquifer sectors (mainly into a two-kilometre strip of coastline). The degree and the length of the marine intrusion were exacerbated by intensive pumping for irrigation needs, particularly during the dry season. Other factors such as coastal aquifer permeability, saturation zone thickness and basement depth also affect the degree and length of the marine <b>intrusion.</b> <b>Seawater</b> pollution is more marked in the southwestern coastal area. Reuse of irrigation saline waters, especially as groundwater circulates in the coastal and eastern sectors deep in the soil (to depths of 10 m). Several important factors have been highlighted concerning the origin of the chemical elements in solution and the mechanism of hydrochemical distribution: evaporation, lithology of tapped aquifers, water table depth, distance of wells from the coast, type of soil, use of fertilizers, frequency of pumping operations, and rainfall, among others. A regular network of 179 wells was monitored and surveyed in this study. Spatial and temporal changes in the water table and in the hydrochemistry of the aquifer were monitored between 1991 and 1998, a span which included an exceptionally rainy period (1996). Data are compared with those from 1971, the year groundwater exploitation began. The studied region is characterized by a semi-arid climate, mean annual rainfall of 391 mm (between 1977 and 1998), mean temperature of 17. 8 °C, and mean rainfall input of 142 mm. In the dry season, high temperature combined with low rainfall and intensive pumping operations give rise to salinization of shallow groundwater. Groundwater in the area of study circulates in two principal hydrogeological matrices : 1. Sandy-calcareous Plio-Quaternary and paleozoic strata in costal sectors and the eastern part located between Tnine Chtouka and Bir Jdid. These hydrogeological strata are characterized by significant porosity and permeability and are exploited at a shallow depth, generally less than 14 m, under sandy-clayed soil. 2. A Cretaceous aquifer in marly limestone located between Oum-er-Rbia River and Tnine Chtouka. This aquifer is characterized by a low permeability and a water table generally exceeding 24 m in depth. Monitoring showed that after the heavy rains of 1996 (943 mm, with infiltration of 142 mm), the water table rose markedly in all study wells and a lagged dilution (3 to 6 months) was noted for all mineral salts dissolved in water. In fact, the water table, which had dropped between 1971 and 1995 (10 m in the costal sectors and 20 m in the others parts of the studied region), rose by an average 4. 5 to 12. 5 m in the central and up-gradient parts of the plain. Several factors were at work between 1971 and 1995 : decreased pumping times (about 15 minutes) combined with sharp decreases in the thickness of the saturated zone; appearance of a closed piezometric level in the western region between Oum-er-Rbia River and Tnine Chtouka; and desiccation of 59 wells. With the aid of a polynomial model, annual level evolution of the five coastal test piezometers showed correlation factors of 0. 76 to 0. 93 respectively for years 1996 and 1997. Other quantitative effects of exceptional rains on groundwater identified include: increased pumping time (up from less than 15 minutes prior to the heavy rains of 1996); increased saturated zone thickness; rises in the water-table surpassing former sea-level heights in certain wells; general advancement of the piezometric levels towards the coastline; and increased aquifer thickness stemming from longer pumping times. In terms of quality, groundwater showed gradually increasing salinity (by a factor of 2) between 1971 and 1995 and significant improvements after the rains of 1996. Between 1971 and 1995, increased mineralization was observed mainly in coastal and eastern parts of the aquifer between Tnine Chtouka and Bir Jdid. Conductivity of the waters in some coastal wells increased from 5 mS/cm to more than 10 mS/cm. After the exceptional rains of 1996, differences ranging from 0. 5 to more than 4 mS/cm were observed in 71 % of the 179 wells analysed. Over the same period, chloride concentrations decreased by average values ranging from 150 to 500 mg/l (higher decreases surpassed 1000 mg/l). By contrast, spatial distributions of conductivity and of the main mineral salts remained unchanged and coastal and eastern groundwaters were still the most vulnerable to high salinity. The quantitative and qualitative effects of heavy rain point to the high sensitivity of these groundwaters to rain input, which is the principal recharge source of the studied aquifer...|$|R

Dong Nai River, which is regulated further upstream by two dams, has ample water resources to supply the growing city with more water. However, in dry years drinking water supply competes with agricultural uses that may together exceed water availability.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 20th Century, {{farmers in the}} Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, who {{depended}} on irrigating their fields with fresh water from the two rivers noticed an increase in salinity farther inland than before. It became obvious that fresh water was being pumped out of the Delta faster than it could be replenished by rain and snow during the wet season. Farmers, businessmen and politicians complained that allowing fresh water to flow to the ocean was wasteful. While many solutions were proposed, few appeared practical. A political consensus formed that damming the Carquinez Strait should solve the <b>seawater</b> <b>intrusion</b> problem.|$|E
50|$|On the Orontes River {{analyses}} of water samples for ammonia, suspended solids and BOD indicated thatconcentrations exceeded the allowable limits, {{particularly in the}} lower part of the river. In the upper part, water quality is acceptable. On the Quweiq River flowing through Aleppo concentrations of BOD, ammonia and heavy metals exceeded allowable limits. In the coastal region wells used for drinking purposes are contaminated with high concentrations of nitrates and ammonia because of sewage discharge and use of fertilizers. Water salinity is also high in some wells because of <b>seawater</b> <b>intrusion</b> into the fresh groundwater aquifers.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} that several building foundations and underground infrastructures in Dammam have been structurally weakened by a rising water table. Various sources, including precipitation, <b>seawater</b> <b>intrusion</b> and leakage from underground water networks and sewage pipes, were anecdotally suspected to be contributors to the rising shallow water-table problem. A recent study (T.M. Iwalewa et al., 2016) revealed that leakages from drinking-water supply and sewage-collection pipe networks are the major contributors to {{the rise in the}} water table in the city. The study showed that the rising shallow water-table problem represents a serious threat to the present and future development of the city.|$|E
