To keep the canal in Upper Canadian hands, the province had passed a law barring Americans from the company's directorate. The company was thus controlled by the Family Compact, even though they had few shares. By 1834, it was clear the canal would never make money and that the province would be on the hook for the large loans; the canal and the canal company thus became a political issue, as local farmers argued the huge expense would ultimately only benefit American farmers in the west and the merchants who transported their grain.|$|R

The route was laid along Buckeye Street at the insistence of the merchants who hoped to reduced drayage expenses. Samuel Mills built a large frame structure at the Howard flouring mills, which served as a warehouse for the company's freight and a passenger depot.

By 1895 the Yokohama Specie Bank opened a branch in Honolulu and the merchant importer/exporter Hackfeld & Co. went into banking. Following the annexation of Hawaii in July 1898, plans were set in motion to establish the First American Bank of Hawaii backed by investors in New York and California.

5000|$|The {{immediate}} {{impact of the}} decision was to throw the development of railroads {{in the state of}} Michigan into chaos and to call into question the validity of all municipal bonds already issued.

Cass County approved a large <b>stock</b> <b>subscription</b> for the Pacific Railroad Company. This corporation later surrendered the bonds to the new Saint Louis and Santa Fe Railroad, from whence they were still later assigned to the Land Grant Railroad & Construction Company of New York. Citizens of Cass County sought by injunction to prevent the funding of these bonds, but by legal maneuvering and collusion, a new set of bonds was issued secretly. Basically the outraged populace viewed this development as a sophisticated maneuver to benefit the holders of bonds that had become worthless by re-obligating the county to pay those same bonds. Three men who helped to perpetrate this swindle, including the county attorney and a judge of the county court, were shot and killed on April 24, 1872 while on board a Katy railroad spur between Bryson, Missouri and Paola, Kansas (in or near what is now known as Gunn City). Forty-one men were arrested and brought to trial for these killings, but there were no convictions. At the time of the shootings, a Republican newspaper, belonging to Mr. Porter J.

40|$|Contemporary {{debates about}} the {{development}} and production of new theatre writing are characterized by a friction between practitioners who primarily engage with the production of individually-authored play-texts – ‘text-based theatre’ – and practitioners who primarily engage with the collaborative devising of non-script-led works – ‘non-text-based performance’. From current perspectives, the ‘method’ espoused by Joint Stock in the 1970 s – engaging the critical efforts, creative imagination and somatic resources of actors {{in the creation of}} a work subsequently lodged as textually predicated - presents an example of a process that potentially bridges the gap between script-based and performance-led work. Yet Stafford-Clark’s continued emphasis upon the centrality of the writer – which continued during his tenure at the Royal Court and has found new expression in his company Out of Joint – serves to diminish and even occlude the contributions of the actors and designers who were active participants in the creation of original works for theatre. This paper argues that despite its collective ambit, Joint <b>Stock’s</b> <b>subscription</b> to, and active affirmation of, the symbolic and cultural capital that accrues around individual ‘authorship’ has – despite the company’s own methods - contributed to the discursive promulgation of a 'writer-led theatre' which itself has worked to position practices of playwriting in hostile opposition to practices of devising. Through an examination of contemporary play-texts collaboratively produced but individually ‘authored’, I will consider how ‘authorship’ functions within taxonomies of contemporary theatre practice...|$|R

By the end of the year, the Middle Division had reached Bridgeton, and the Eastern Division to Eldora (3 miles (4.8 km) northeast of Peach Bottom). The Middle Division reached Delta and the prospect of abundant slate traffic in 1876, while the Eastern Division pushed on to Dorsey (1 mile (1.6 km) north of Peach Bottom). A contretemps occurred when President Boyd opposed extension of the Middle Division to Peach Bottom, {{on the grounds that it}} would generate no local traffic and there was no prospect of bridging the Susquehanna in the near future.

40|$|Many {{scholars}} {{agree that}} a robust market for corporate control provides a critical check on managerial opportunism within public corporations. Even prior to a tender offer, {{the specter of a}} takeover provides a powerful mechanism for aligning the incentives of managers and shareholders. Conventional wisdom, therefore, views with suspicion any practice that retards the takeover threat looming over managers who perform poorly. One such practice that has garnered particular attention of late is managerial "favoritism" towards influential block shareholders. Favoritism can take any number of forms, ranging from preferential <b>stock</b> <b>subscriptions,</b> to selective information disclosure, to outright cash payments. But regardless of its form, the argument goes, favoritism is potentially harmful to firm value, as it co-opts one of the most plausible monitors of management. Thus, many argue that corporate law should proscribe (or at least discourage) all forms of favoritism towards block shareholders. In this Article, we question whether the case for prohibiting favoritism is as compelling as conventional wisdom suggests. Our arguments are both practical and conceptual. From a practical standpoint, we raise doubts as to whether piecemeal regulation is even capable of curtailing favoritism writ large, rather than simply relocating it to less verifiable (and less efficient) domains. From a conceptual standpoint, we argue that permitting favoritism would likely enhance outsiders incentives to form a large block in order to extract patronage. Predicting this enhanced incentive, a rational manager would have to choose ex ante between (1) acquiescing to a division of her control benefits with outsiders; or (2) imposing significant constraints on her own self-dealing so as to deter the initial formation of any block. Using a game-theoretic model, we demonstrate that under many plausible circumstances, managers would prefer the latter option to the former. Consequently, playing favorites with block shareholders may, ironically, be in all shareholders interests...|$|R
