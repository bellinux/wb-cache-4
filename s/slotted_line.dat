500|$|When the <b>slotted</b> <b>line</b> is {{terminated}} with {{a precision}} matching load {{there is no}} variation in the detected power along the line, other than a very small decrease due to losses in the line.

Among the most notable features of this circuit is a grounded uniplanar transition (in effect, a balun) between a <b>slot</b> <b>line</b> and one of two coplanar waveguides (CPWs). The design of this circuit is well suited to integration of the circuit into a microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) package.

The input CPW feeds the input signal to antiparallel flip-chip Schottky diodes connected to the edges of the <b>slot</b> <b>line.</b> Phase switching is effected by the combination of (1) the abrupt transition from the input CPW to the <b>slot</b> <b>line</b> and (2) CPW ground tuning effected by switching of the bias on the diodes. Grounding of the slot metal to the bottom metal gives rise to a frequency cutoff in the slot. This cutoff is valuable for separating different frequency components when the circuit is used as a mixer or multiplier. Proceeding along the <b>slot</b> <b>line</b> toward the output end, one encounters the aforementioned transition, which couples the <b>slot</b> <b>line</b> to the output CPW.

[...] However, to completely characterise the reflection coefficient, the phase of ρ must also be found.

[...] Moving the probe right up to the DUT is not practicable so a different approach is usually adopted. [...] The position of the first minimum when the reference short is in place is noted. [...] The distance back along the line from this reference point to the next minimum when the DUT is in place will be the same as the distance from the DUT to the first minimum.

[...] The parameter most commonly measured by a <b>slotted</b> <b>line</b> is SWR. This serves as a measure of the accuracy of the impedance match to the item under test.

[...] It is also necessary in waveguide slotted lines to place the slot at a position where the current in the waveguide walls is parallel to the slot. [...] The current will then not be disturbed by the presence of the slot as long as it is not too wide. [...] For the dominant mode this is on the centre-line of the broad face of the waveguide, but for some other modes it may need to be off-centre.
