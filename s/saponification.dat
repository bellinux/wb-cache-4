25|$|A cold-process soapmaker first {{looks up}} the <b>saponification</b> value for each unique fat on an oil {{specification}} sheet. Oil specification sheets contain laboratory test results for each fat, including the precise <b>saponification</b> {{value of the}} fat. The <b>saponification</b> value for a specific fat varies by season and by specimen species. This value {{is used to calculate}} the exact amount of sodium hydroxide to react with the fat to form soap. The <b>saponification</b> value must be converted into an equivalent sodium hydroxide value for use in cold process soapmaking. Excess unreacted lye in the soap results in a very high pH and can burn or irritate skin, whereas not enough lye leaves the soap greasy. Most soap makers formulate their recipes with a 2–5% deficit of lye, to account for the unknown deviation of <b>saponification</b> value between their oil batch and laboratory averages.|$|E
25|$|After the {{insulation}} period, the soap is firm {{enough to be}} removed from the mold and cut into bars. At this time, it is safe to use the soap, since <b>saponification</b> is in essence complete. However, cold-process soaps are typically cured and hardened on a drying rack for 2–6 weeks before use. During this cure period, trace amounts of residual lye are consumed by <b>saponification</b> and excess water evaporates.|$|E
25|$|In the hot process, the {{hydroxide}} and the fat are {{heated and}} mixed together at 80–100°C, a little below boiling point, until <b>saponification</b> is complete, which, before modern scientific equipment, the soapmaker determined by taste (the sharp, distinctive {{taste of the}} hydroxide disappears after it is saponified) or by eye; the experienced eye can tell when gel stage and full <b>saponification</b> has occurred. Beginners can find this information through research and classes. Tasting soap for readiness is not recommended, as sodium and potassium hydroxides, when not saponified, are highly caustic.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{alcohols}} can be stereochemically inverted by {{formation of}} a formyl ester followed by <b>saponification.</b> The secondary alcohol is mixed directly with DCC, formic acid, and a strong base such as sodium methoxide.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is traditionally}} used in soap making (cold process soap, <b>saponification).</b> It {{was made in}} the nineteenth century for a hard surface rather than liquid product because it was easier to store and transport.|$|E
25|$|Lutein {{is present}} in plants as fatty-acid esters, {{with one or two}} fatty acids bound to the two hydroxyl-groups. For this reason, <b>saponification</b> (de-esterfication) of lutein esters to yield free lutein may yield lutein in any ratio from 1:1 to 1:2 molar ratio with the saponifying fatty acid.|$|E
25|$|Hot-processed soaps {{are created}} by {{encouraging}} the <b>saponification</b> reaction by adding heat {{to speed up the}} reaction. In contrast with cold-pour soap which is poured into molds {{and for the most part}} only then saponifies, hot-process soaping for the most part saponifies the oils completely and only then is poured into molds.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} can be {{used for}} the base-driven hydrolysis of esters (as in <b>saponification),</b> amides and alkyl halides. However, the limited solubility of sodium hydroxide in organic solvents means that the more soluble potassium hydroxide (KOH) is often preferred. Touching sodium hydroxide solution with the bare hands, while not recommended, produces a slippery feeling. This happens because the oils of the hand are converted to soap.|$|E
25|$|Wet {{chemical}} (potassium acetate, potassium carbonate, or potassium citrate) extinguishes {{the fire}} by forming an air-excluding soapy foam blanket over the burning oil through the chemical process of <b>saponification</b> (an alkali reacting with a fat {{to form a}} soap) and by the water content cooling the oil below its ignition temperature. Generally class A and K (F in Europe) only, although older models also achieved class B and C fire-fighting capability in the past, current models are rated A:K (Amerex, Ansul, Buckeye and Strike First) or K only (Badger/Kidde).|$|E
25|$|Fat {{necrosis}} is specialized necrosis of fat tissue, {{resulting from}} the action of activated lipases on fatty tissues such as the pancreas. In the pancreas it leads to acute pancreatitis, a condition where the pancreatic enzymes leak out into the peritoneal cavity, and liquefy the membrane by splitting the triglyceride esters into fatty acids through fat <b>saponification.</b> Calcium, magnesium or sodium may bind to these lesions to produce a chalky-white substance. The calcium deposits are microscopically distinctive and may {{be large enough to}} be visible on radiographic examinations. To the naked eye, calcium deposits appear as gritty white flecks.|$|E
25|$|This reaction, {{which is}} {{conducted}} on large scale industrially, requires {{the removal of}} the water from the reaction mixture as it is formed. Esters react in the presence of an acid or base to give back the alcohol and a salt. This reaction is known as <b>saponification</b> because it is used in the preparation of soap. Ethanol can also form esters with inorganic acids. Diethyl sulfate and triethyl phosphate are prepared by treating ethanol with sulfur trioxide and phosphorus pentoxide respectively. Diethyl sulfate is a useful ethylating agent in organic synthesis. Ethyl nitrite, prepared from the reaction of ethanol with sodium nitrite and sulfuric acid, was formerly used as a diuretic.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{can be used}} {{to extinguish}} small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire, as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. However, it should not be applied to fires in deep fryers; the sudden release of gas may cause the grease to splatter. Sodium bicarbonate is used in BC dry chemical fire extinguishers {{as an alternative to the}} more corrosive diammonium phosphate in ABC extinguishers. The alkaline nature of sodium bicarbonate makes it the only dry chemical agent, besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale fire suppression systems installed in commercial kitchens. Because it can act as an alkali, the agent has a mild <b>saponification</b> effect on hot grease, which forms a smothering, soapy foam.|$|E
25|$|Scouring, is a {{chemical}} washing process {{carried out on}} cotton fabric to remove natural wax and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from the fibres and any added soiling or dirt. Scouring is usually carried in iron vessels called kiers. The fabric is boiled in an alkali, which forms a soap with free fatty acids (<b>saponification).</b> A kier is usually enclosed, so the solution of sodium hydroxide can be boiled under pressure, excluding oxygen which would degrade the cellulose in the fibre. If the appropriate reagents are used, scouring will also remove size from the fabric although desizing often precedes scouring and {{is considered to be}} a separate process known as fabric preparation. Preparation and scouring are prerequisites to most of the other finishing processes. At this stage even the most naturally white cotton fibres are yellowish, and bleaching, the next process, is required.|$|E
2500|$|Cold-process soapmaking {{requires}} exact {{measurements of}} lye and fat amounts and computing their ratio, using <b>saponification</b> charts {{to ensure the}} finished product does not contain any excess hydroxide or too much free unreacted fat. <b>Saponification</b> charts should also be used in hot processes, but are not necessary for the [...] "fully boiled hot-process" [...] soaping.|$|E
2500|$|Systemic {{complications}} include ARDS, multiple {{organ dysfunction}} syndrome, DIC, hypocalcemia (from fat <b>saponification),</b> hyperglycemia and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (from pancreatic insulin-producing beta cell damage), malabsorption due to exocrine failure ...|$|E
2500|$|Stearic acid is {{obtained}} from {{fats and oils}} by the <b>saponification</b> of the triglycerides using hot water (about 100°C). The resulting mixture is then distilled. [...] Commercial stearic acid is often a mixture of stearic and palmitic acids, although purified stearic acid is available.|$|E
2500|$|... α-Linolenic acid {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Rollett {{as cited in}} J. W. McCutcheon's synthesis in 1942, and referred to in Green and Hilditch's 1930s survey. [...] It was first artificially synthesized in 1995 from C6 homologating agents. [...] A Wittig reaction of the phosphonium salt of triphenylphosphonium bromide with methyl 9-oxononanoate, followed by <b>saponification,</b> completed the synthesis.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to the {{hydration}} of sulfuric acid, {{dissolution of}} solid sodium hydroxide in {{water is a}} highly exothermic reaction in which {{a large amount of}} heat is liberated, posing a threat to safety through the possibility of splashing. The resulting solution is usually colourless and odorless. [...] As with other alkaline solutions, it feels slippery when it comes in contact with skin due to <b>saponification.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Soaps for {{cleaning}} are obtained by treating vegetable or animal {{oils and fats}} with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in an aqueous solution. Fats and oils are composed of triglycerides; three molecules of fatty acids attach to a single molecule of glycerol. The alkaline solution, which is often called lye (although the term [...] "lye soap" [...] refers almost exclusively to soaps made with sodium hydroxide), induces <b>saponification.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the primary}} {{sedimentation}} stage, sewage flows through large tanks, commonly called [...] "pre-settling basins", [...] "primary sedimentation tanks" [...] or [...] "primary clarifiers". The tanks {{are used to}} settle sludge while grease and oils rise {{to the surface and}} are skimmed off. Primary settling tanks are usually equipped with mechanically driven scrapers that continually drive the collected sludge towards a hopper in the base of the tank where it is pumped to sludge treatment facilities. Grease and oil from the floating material can sometimes be recovered for <b>saponification</b> (soap making).|$|E
2500|$|The batch is then {{poured into}} molds, kept warm with towels or blankets, {{and left to}} {{continue}} <b>saponification</b> for 12 to 48 hours. (Milk soaps or other soaps with sugars added are the exception. They typically do not require insulation, {{as the presence of}} sugar increases the speed of the reaction and thus the production of heat.) During this time, it is normal for the soap to go through a [...] "gel phase," [...] wherein the opaque soap will turn somewhat transparent for several hours, before once again turning opaque.|$|E
2500|$|Stearic acid {{is mainly}} {{used in the}} {{production}} of detergents, soaps, and cosmetics such as shampoos and shaving cream products. Soaps are not made directly from stearic acid, but indirectly by <b>saponification</b> of triglycerides consisting of stearic acid esters. [...] Esters of stearic acid with ethylene glycol, glycol stearate, and glycol distearate are used to produce a pearly effect in shampoos, soaps, and other cosmetic products. They are added to the product in molten form and allowed to crystallize under controlled conditions. [...] Detergents are obtained from amides and quaternary alkylammonium derivatives of stearic acid.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{measurements}} of tissue and {{blood levels of}} reactive oxygen species {{have been used as}} markers of diseases in which these species are generated and may contribute to tissue injury and systemic disturbances; examples of such diseases include a wide range of neurological, cardiovascular, infectious, autoimmune, and genetic diseases (see oxidative stress). [...] HODEs measurements have been evaluated as markers for many of these oxygen stress-related diseases. [...] These measurements commonly use <b>saponification</b> methods to release HODEs bound by acylation to other molecules; they therefore measure not only free HODEs but also HODEs acylated to phospholipids, glycerides, cholesterol, and other lipids.|$|E
2500|$|Handmade soap {{from the}} cold process also differs from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the alkali (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called [...] "superfatting"), and the {{glycerol}} left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer and less resistant to becoming [...] "mushy" [...] if left wet. Since {{it is better to}} add too much oil and have left-over fat, than to add too much lye and have left-over lye, soap produced from the hot process also contains left-over glycerol and its concomitant pros and cons. Further addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat. However, if too much fat is added, it can leave a [...] "greasy" [...] feel to the skin. Sometimes, an emollient additive, such as jojoba oil or shea butter, is added [...] "at trace" [...] (i.e., {{the point at which the}} <b>saponification</b> process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken in the cold process method) in the belief that nearly all the lye will be spent and it will escape <b>saponification</b> and remain intact. In the case of hot-process soap, an emollient may be added after the initial oils have saponified so they remain unreacted in the finished soap. Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process known as [...] "lye discount" [...] in which the soap maker uses less alkali than required instead of adding extra fats.|$|E
2500|$|An {{advantage}} of the fully boiled hot process in soapmaking is the exact amount of hydroxide required need not be known with great accuracy. They originated when {{the purity of the}} alkali hydroxides were unreliable, as these processes can use even naturally found alkalis, such as wood ashes and potash deposits. In the fully boiled process, the mix is actually boiled (100+ °C), and, after <b>saponification</b> has occurred, the [...] "neat soap" [...] is precipitated from the solution by adding common salt, and the excess liquid is drained off. This excess liquid carries away with it much of the impurities and color compounds in the fat, to leave a purer, whiter soap, and with practically all the glycerine removed. The hot, soft soap is then pumped into a mold. The spent hydroxide solution is processed for recovery of glycerine.|$|E
2500|$|The lye is {{dissolved}} in water. Then, the oils are heated, or melted {{if they are}} solid at room temperature. Once the oils are liquefied and the lye is fully dissolved in water, they are combined. This lye-fat mixture is mixed until the two phases (oils and water) are fully emulsified. Emulsification is most easily identified visually when the soap exhibits some level of [...] "trace," [...] which is the thickening of the mixture. Many modern-day amateur soapmakers use a stick blender to speed up this process. Varying levels of trace can occur at each stage of the <b>saponification</b> process. Depending on how additives affect trace, they may be added at light trace, medium trace, or heavy trace. After much stirring, the mixture turns to the consistency of a thin pudding. [...] "Trace" [...] corresponds roughly to viscosity. Essential oils and fragrance oils can be added with the initial soaping oils, but solid additives such as botanicals, herbs, oatmeal, or other additives are most commonly added at light trace, just as the mixture starts to thicken.|$|E
50|$|<b>Saponification</b> value: {{the mass}} in milligrams of KOH {{required}} to saponify a fatty acid in one gram of sample. <b>Saponification</b> {{is used to}} determine average chain length of fatty acids in fat.|$|E

50|$|Zomepirac can be {{synthesized}} from diethyl 1,3-acetonedicarboxylate, chloroacetone, and aqueous methylamine (MeNH2) via {{modification of}} the Hantzsch pyrrole synthesis to give intermediate 1. <b>Saponification,</b> monoesterification, and thermal decarboxylation gives ester 2. This is acylated with N,N-dimethyl-p-chlorobenzamide, and finally <b>saponification</b> gives zomepirac (3).|$|E
50|$|Basic {{hydrolysis}} of esters, {{known as}} <b>saponification,</b> {{is not an}} equilibrium process; a full equivalent of base is consumed in the reaction, which produces one equivalent of alcohol and one equivalent of a carboxylate salt.The <b>saponification</b> of esters of fatty acids is an industrially important process, used {{in the production of}} soap.|$|E
50|$|N-Benzyl-4-piperidone is {{made when}} 1 {{equivalent}} of benzylamine is condensed with 2 molecules of ethylacrylate and the double conjugate addition product is {{subject of a}} Dieckmann cyclization followed by <b>saponification</b> and decarboxylation. Note that the intermediate 3-carboethoxy-N-Benzyl-4-piperidone prior to <b>saponification</b> {{can be used as}} a product to make Pimozide, Benperidol and droperidol.|$|E
