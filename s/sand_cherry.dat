60|$|I {{have looked}} after the wild {{stock of the}} town, which give a {{faithful}} herdsman {{a good deal of}} trouble by leaping fences; and I have had an eye to the unfrequented nooks and corners of the farm; though I did not always know whether Jonas or Solomon worked in a particular field to-day; that was none of my business. I have watered the red huckleberry, the <b>sand</b> <b>cherry</b> and the nettle-tree, the red pine and the black ash, the white grape and the yellow violet, which might have withered else in dry seasons.|$|E
60|$|My {{house was}} {{on the side of}} a hill, {{immediately}} on the edge of the larger wood, in the midst of a young forest of pitch pines and hickories, and half a dozen rods from the pond, to which a narrow footpath led down the hill. In my front yard grew the strawberry, blackberry, and life-everlasting, johnswort and goldenrod, shrub oaks and <b>sand</b> <b>cherry,</b> blueberry and groundnut. Near the end of May, the <b>sand</b> <b>cherry</b> (Cerasus pumila) adorned the sides of the path with its delicate flowers arranged in umbels cylindrically about its short stems, which last, in the fall, weighed down with good-sized and handsome cherries, fell over in wreaths like rays on every side. I tasted them out of compliment to Nature, though they were scarcely palatable. The sumach (Rhus glabra) grew luxuriantly about the house, pushing up through the embankment which I had made, and growing five or six feet the first season. Its broad pinnate tropical leaf was pleasant though strange to look on. The large buds, suddenly pushing out late in the spring from dry sticks which had seemed to be dead, developed themselves as by magic into graceful green and tender boughs, an inch in diameter; and sometimes, as I sat at my window, so heedlessly did they grow and tax their weak joints, I heard a fresh and tender bough suddenly fall like a fan to the ground, when there was not a breath of air stirring, broken off by its own weight. In August, the large masses of berries, which, when in flower, had attracted many wild bees, gradually assumed their bright velvety crimson hue, and by their weight again bent down and broke the tender limbs.|$|E

2500|$|Lake Michigan {{has many}} beaches. The region is often {{referred}} to as the [...] "Third Coast" [...] of the United States, after those of the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The sand is often soft and off-white, known as [...] "singing sands" [...] because of the squeaking noise (caused by high quartz content) it emits when walked upon. Some beaches have sand dunes covered in green beach grass and <b>sand</b> <b>cherries,</b> and the water is usually clear and cool, between , even in the late summer months. However, because prevailing westerly winds tend to move the surface water toward the east, there is a flow of warmer water to the Michigan shore in the summer.|$|R
5000|$|Following Bourne's {{acquisition}} of Rank Leisure, {{the company began}} integrating its Haven and British Holidays chains during a seven-year development phase. The individual brands [...] "Haven Holidays" [...] and [...] "British Holidays" [...] continued to trade individually until November 2004, when a final three Haven parks and two British Holidays resorts were disposed of, those being: Wemyss Bay, Pendine <b>Sands,</b> <b>Cherry</b> Tree, Warmwell and Torquay. These were relatively small parks, and Bourne Leisure eventually decided to sell these off, stating {{that they no longer}} fitted well in the Haven and British Holidays brands. This reduced the number of parks in the British Holidays chain to 17 and the number of Haven parks to 18. At the same time, both brands merged as [...] "Haven and British Holidays" [...] and released a new brochure and website under that name. Eventually, in November 2007, the company ceased trading as [...] "British Holidays" [...] and the Haven name is now used throughout the chain.|$|R

40|$|Curtonotum helvum (Loew) (Curtonotidae, Diptera), {{the only}} Nearctic {{representative}} of the Curtonotidae was reared in the laboratory from a decaying grasshopper egg pod. Curtonotum helvum can be collected from mid-June to Sep-tember throughout its wide Nearctic range. In a study of a population on the southern coast of Lake Huron, the species {{was found to be}} cre-puscular and possibly even nocturnal. Copula-tions were only observed at dusk. In captivity the flies readily consumed coyote dung, <b>sand</b> <b>cherries,</b> and insect carcasses, but failed to ovi-posit on any of these substrates. The female re-productive system is characterized by two scler-otized, scimitar-shaped spermathecae and an an-teroventral pouch arising from the vagina. The ventral receptacle is short and tubular with a sclerotized tip. The anteroventral pouch is also present in the remaining two genera of the fam-ily (Axinota Wulp, Cyrtona Seguy) and likely constitutes a new synapomorphy of the Curton-otidae whereas the two spermathecae are a groundplan feature of the Ephydroidea. First de-scriptions of curtonotid eggs are provided. The eggs of Curtonotum helvum and those of Axi-nota uniformis (Malloch) bear longitudinal ridg-es, have a cup-shaped micropyle, and aeropyles at the anterior pole.

50|$|Probably {{even before}} the Potawatomi came to the region, the area's {{abundant}} natural resources fed many other native peoples and animals. Among the Potawatomi and the first settlers, these abundant resources proved more than adequate for subsistence and very lucrative for trade. There were the cranberry marshes, from which bushel upon bushel was hauled to early market. There were numerous other sorts of berries and fruits as well, including mulberries, huckleberries, blackberries, strawberries, whortleberries, raspberries, roseberries, gooseberries, wintergreen berries, currants, <b>sand</b> hill <b>cherries,</b> red and yellow wild plum, crabapple, paw paw, haw, sassafras, and wild grape.|$|R
50|$|Denver {{at first}} was a mining settlement, where gold prospectors panned gold from the <b>sands</b> of nearby <b>Cherry</b> Creek and the South Platte River. Larimer, along with {{associates}} in the Denver City Land Company, laid out the roads parallel to the creek and sold parcels in the town to merchants and miners, {{with the intention of}} creating a major city that would cater to new immigrants. In the early years, land parcels were often traded for grubstakes or gambled away by miners in Auraria. However, the prospectors discovered that the gold deposits in these streams were discouragingly poor and quickly exhausted. When rich gold deposits were discovered in the mountains west of Denver in early 1859 it appeared that Denver City might become a ghost town as prospectors left for more lucrative claims. However, once the gold rush began there was a great need for materials that couldn't be produced locally, which assured Denver's future as a supply hub for the new mines.|$|R

50|$|Prunus pumila, {{commonly}} called <b>sand</b> <b>cherry,</b> is a North American species of cherry {{in the rose}} family. It is widespread in eastern and central Canada from New Brunswick west to Saskatchewan and the northern United States from Maine to Montana, south as far as Colorado, Kansas, Indiana, and Virginia, with a few isolated populations in Tennessee and Utah. It grows in sandy locations such as shorelines and dunes.|$|E
50|$|Blowouts {{are formed}} by the {{on-shore}} winds of Lake Michigan. The winds move sand and pile it into dunes. As the dunes form, plants begin to take hold, stabilizing the sand. Beach grasses form a large underground system of roots. This root system, creates stable areas of sand, from which the dune can grow. Slowly other plants take root in the protected areas, including bearberry (kinnikinnick) and small evergreens. Over time, larger plants like sumac, <b>sand</b> <b>cherry,</b> cottonwood, and juniper take hold and replace the grasses and smaller plants.|$|E
5000|$|Ten {{days after}} her win at Leicester the filly contested the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse and started the 40/1 {{outsider}} of the seven runners. The Phoenix Stakes winner Damson started odds-on favourite ahead of Soar and Dick Poole Fillies' Stakes winner Suez, whilst the other three runners were Jewel In The <b>Sand</b> (<b>Cherry</b> Hinton Stakes), Golden Legacy (Firth of Clyde Stakes and Slip Dance (Empress Stakes). Winston again took the ride after her intended jockey Jimmy Fortune had been kicked in the stomach by a horse at Salisbury Racecourse on the previous day. Magical Romance tracked the leader Suez before moving up to challenge for the lead approaching the final furlong. The race resulted in a blanket finish, with Magical Romance prevailing by a neck from Suez, with Damson, Golden Legacy and Slip Dance close behind. Winston admitted to some mixed feelings, saying [...] "It is really nice to win this but I do feel sorry for Jimmy, he's been very unlucky". Meehan explained We ran her in the Princess Margaret before Leicester where we thought she would finish {{in the first four}} but she got jarred up and her last win just helped to get her confidence back. She's a lovely filly and has always shown plenty at home. The rain probably helped her a little bit but she's a real nice filly.

The grafts were planted in the spring of 1893, and the budding was done during July of the same year. The trees of suitable size were taken up late in the fall of 1894, the grafts having had two seasons’ growth, and the buds one season’s growth. All the trees had a very strong root-system, consisting mainly of a dense cluster of long cylindrical roots from immediately beneath the crown, no special tap-root being formed.

40|$|During {{the past}} few years the use of the <b>Sand</b> <b>cherry</b> (Primus pumila), as a stock for the cherry and plum, has been much discussed, but as yet we have had no convincing {{experience}} favorable to its use in cherry propagation. But in Utah and {{in various parts of the}} prairie States we have plum trees on this stock of several years’ growth, which favor the belief that our cultivated varieties will unite perfectly with its wood, come into bearing earlier, and become dwarfed in size of tree. With a view to more exact conclusions we grew, in 1892, about five thousand stocks from seed gathered in northwest Nebraska. The seed was washed from the pulp, dried for three or four days in the shade, mixed with sand in boxes, and put out for winter freezing. The seedlings made a fine stand and their growth the first season was about equal in height and diameter of stem to our seedlings of native plum. In the fall of 1892 we took up the largest of the seedlings for crown-grafting, leaving the others for budding...|$|E

40|$|Open pit mining for iron-ore and {{magnetic}} taconite in northeastern Minnesota {{has produced a}} landscape with numerous overburden deposits or man-made plateaus which are susceptible to erosion and have a physical environment hostile to natural revegetation. Many of these plateaus are {{in close proximity to}} small municipalities. This study investigated the sprinkler application of secondary treated sewage effluent to the overburden material with respect to: 1) renovation effects on wastewater, and (2) potential amelioration benefits on such nutrient-poor sites. Two sites were evaluated, one was deposited 20 years ago and the other 2 months prior {{to the beginning of the}} study. Each site consisted of glacial tills of the Wisconsin Period and were of sandy-loam texture with 20 to 30 percent rock by volume. Compaction and poor drainage of the older site restricted irrigation rates to 0. 25 centimeters per hour; treatments consisted of 0, 3. 7 and 6. 0 centimeters in a total of 8 applications over a 9 week period. 'rhe newer site, more representative of recently deposited material, was irrigated at rates of 0, 5, and 10 centimeters per week for 12 weeks. Effluent and soil percolate were analyzed for total kjeldahl nitrogen, nitrate plus nitrite-nitrogen, total phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, chloride, specific conductance, and total alkalinity. Soil percolate samples were obtained at 30, 60 and 120 centimeter depths for the older site and at 50 and 100 centimeter depths at the newer site. The physical and chemical properties of soils were investigated before and after the irrigation season for both sites. The The effects of effluent irrigation on the establishment of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.), northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) eastern white pine (Pinus strobes L.) and a hybrid poplar were evaluated on the older site. On the newer site the establishment of green ash, <b>sand</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus pumila L.),,jack pine, red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) and Siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) were studied in addition to a grass-legume mixture. Irrigation of 6 cm over 9 weeks on the older, poorly drained site resulted in 98, 89 and 99 percent renovations of nitrate plus nitrite-nitrogen, total kjeldahl nitrogen, and total phosphorus, respectively. On the newly deposited material, irrigation of 60 and 120 cm over a 12 -week period resulted in renovations of 99 percent for phosphorus and 80 to 90 percent for total kjeldahl nitrogen. Nitrate plus nitrite-N, calcium, magnesium and potassium concentrations in soil percolate were higher at 1 meter depth than respective concentrations in the effluent. Effluent applications did not significantly affect the nutrient capital in the soil profiles except that Bray's phosphorus, ammonium nitrogen and sodium accumulations were detected near the soil surface. Although irrigation of 6 cm on the old site did not increase the first year survival or growth of planted trees, green ash and the hybrid poplar exhibited a greater growth response than the other species. Vegetation responses for the newer site were not measured at the time of publication. Water Resources Research Cente...|$|E
