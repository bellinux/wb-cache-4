The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Brutal and breathless, Quantum Of Solace delivers tender emotions along with frenetic action, but coming {{on the heels of}} Casino Royale, it's <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a disappointment." [...] On Metacritic, which assigns an average rating to reviews, {{the film has}} a score of 58 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". Critics generally preferred Casino Royale, but continued to praise Craig's depiction of Bond, and agree that the film is still an enjoyable addition to the series. The action sequences and pacing were praised, but criticism grew over the realism and serious but gritty feel that the film carried over.|$|E

500|$|Ryan Cracknell of Apollo Movie Guide, while {{echoing the}} praise for Holden's performance, {{nonetheless}} {{found that the}} film [...] "doesn't hold up so well today". Citing {{what he sees as}} slow pacing and [...] "long bouts of over-the-top dialogue", Cracknell compares the film to [...] "reading a textbook – not the most exciting thing in the world, but it does provide insights into and perspectives on the foundation of early horror movies and how many similarities carry over into movies half a century and more later." [...] Michael W. Phillips, Jr. concurs, calling the film [...] "a marked improvement on the original film [...] <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a snooze, relying too much on forced comedy and not enough on suspense or fright." [...] Phillips again praises Holden's performance and also Pichel's portrayal of Sandor, but finds the rest of the cast weak.|$|E

According to Nielsen Media Research, it was watched by 814,000 viewers and acquired a 0.4 rating in the 18–49 demographic. The episode slightly dropped {{in terms of}} total viewership from the previous episode, [...] "Callie and Her Sister", which was watched by 980,000 viewers. [...] "Ride Me to Hell" [...] received a positive review from Ology's Josh Harrison, who commented that it [...] "successfully redeemed" [...] the character Grimes, who was his least-favorite character up until this episode. Harrison wrote, [...] "I'm thrilled to see Grimes shine in his starring role. Admittedly this episode was a bit light on isolated funny incidents ... but Randall's director-speak was a solid throughline, and I'm always happy to see more demon politics." [...] Harrison graded the episode 8.7 out of 10 and remarked that [...] "it was a cut above its predecessors this season, but <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> shy {{of the very best}} UA [...] ".|$|E

[...] Chris Carter at Destructoid commented [...] "It's <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> weird that something this goofy was removed, especially with the design Laura has in general," [...] and noted that a character like Necalli is [...] "probably far more harmful" [...] for children's eyes. In another article by Destructoid, Carter stated [...] "It's such a weird thing to me, because R. Mika's butt is still very visible, she just doesn't lightly tap it a few times per match." [...] Likewise, ND Medina at iDigitalTimes expressed confusion over the change, noting that her full butt was still being exposed.

500|$|Pitchfork Media's Jordan Sagent viewed {{that the}} EP [...] "isn't blowing the doors off of anything, {{but plenty of}} rappers have trouble {{releasing}} records this tight and thematically consistent, and ultimately, Hodgy makes his name and money with MellowHype, and that group has shown no signs of slowing down."

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave a mostly positive review, {{giving it a}} 7.5 out of 10, indicating {{that it was a}} [...] "good" [...] episode. He stated, [...] "Things are <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> wobbly on Veronica Mars this season, though this episode had some elements that hopefully herald a turn in the right direction." [...] While criticizing the case-of-the-week, he was more laudatory to the subplots, calling Sheriff Lamb arresting Weevil [...] "the most entertaining scene of the episode" [...] and that [...] "the episode definitely picked up in the last act." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a very mixed review, commenting positively on Veronica and Weevil's relationship while criticizing other aspects of the episode. [...] "While 'President Evil' was not a favorite, and has a few annoying moments, it was generally a perfectly adequate episode of Veronica Mars. That is, until the ending. [...] The implication here is one that I've been dreading for a few episodes: that the radical feminist Lilith House has staged Claire's rape, and possibly others." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B-".|$|E

She's been slowly coming into her own, dealing with the challenges of navigating adulthood and being a super hero. But her training is over now and it's time for the big leagues; the question is can she handle it?... As much as Kamala has a right to be there—it's <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a culture shock.

500|$|Malick and Toll {{shot for}} 100 days in Australia using Panavision cameras and lenses, 24 {{days in the}} Solomon Islands and three days in the United States. They scouted the {{historic}} battlefields on Guadalcanal and shot footage, but health concerns over malaria limited filming to daylight hours only. Logistics were also difficult to shoot the entire film there: As director of photography John Toll put it, [...] "It's <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> difficult to get {{on and off the}} island, and we had some scenes that involved 200 or 300 extras. We would have had to bring everybody to Guadalcanal, and financially it just didn't make sense". The Thin Red Line was filmed predominantly in the Daintree Rainforest and on Bramston Beach, both in north Queensland, Australia. Filming also took place on Dancer Mountain, which had such rough terrain that trailers and production trucks could not make it up the hill. A base camp was set up and roads carved out of the mountain. Transporting 250 actors and 200 crew members up the hill took two hours. Filming took place in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California near Santa Catalina Island.|$|E
500|$|However, {{in a more}} mixed review, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the song [...] "seems {{as if it were}} written by a ninth-grader imagining her rebellious college sister’s lifestyle" [...] and felt that it lacked {{creativity}} within Cyrus' catalog. Writing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan was skeptical of Cyrus' increasingly provocative image, stating that the lyrics in the chorus would be [...] "an odd fit for any singer" [...] and opining that [...] "there's <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too much Disney in her voice to fill the track." [...] Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised the song, writing, [...] "Cyrus said in her recent MTV doc (...) , that she chose it to be her album's first single: 'Not everyone {{came to me and said}} okay, you've got the first single. I had to say no, I know this is it and I'll go to battle if I have to, against anyone who doesn't believe in it. Now I have this freedom to do whatever I want, because people trust me.' She was right about this one. The song's straightforward party is now tied to a sordid universe of visuals- the official video and the VMA performance." [...] Common Sense Media gave the song two stars out of five saying that [...] "After listening to the weird intro to [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] you'll kind of wish the song did just stop right there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anderson is [...] With her English {{accent and}} background, she was mocked and felt {{out of place}} as a {{teenager}} in the American Midwest and soon adopted a Midwestern accent. To this day, she easily shifts between her American and English accents. In May 2013, during an interview with BlogTalkRadio, Anderson addressed the matter of her national identity: [...] "I've been asked whether I feel more like a Brit than an American and I don't know what {{the answer to that question}} is.

2500|$|Currents {{appeared}} on several critics' {{lists of the}} best albums of 2015.

Spin ranked it as the year's fourth-best, calling it the group's [...] "best because its soul actually lies in Motown". The magazine said the album finds Parker [...] "coming to the epiphany {{that no amount of}} pitch- and time-shifting will screw with your perception of reality as much as a lyric that's as direct and true as 'They say people never change but that's bulls**t / They do.'" [...] Mojo also ranked the record as fourth-best of the year. Pitchfork ranked the album as the year's fifth-best, saying, [...] "There's <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of Parker's elegant guitar here, but he's mostly rerouted his perfectionistic craftsmanship to synthesizer tones and drum programming." [...] Paste ranked Currents at number eight on its list of the year's best albums, calling it a [...] "near-perfect album" [...] and [...] "a superb progression from their last efforts, a study in internal consistency." [...] Rolling Stone placed the album at number 13 on its list of the [...] "50 Best Albums of 2015", writing that Parker's [...] "musical rethink... is expansive, resulting in wide-screen adventures like 'Let It Happen'" [...] and that the record is [...] "full of weightless vocals and synthesized funk, for a set that's both blissed-out and mournful, like a set of diary entries from an astronaut floating off into oblivion". The album was also ranked fifth-best of the year by Consequence of Sound and NME, 15th-best by Stereogum, and 22nd-best by PopMatters, while Exclaim! named it the eighth-best pop/rock album of the year.|$|E
