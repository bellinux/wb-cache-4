We consider the numerical solution of the rendering equation by separation of integration domain. The hemispherical integration domain is symmetrically separated into 16 parts. First 9 sub-domains are equal size of orthogonal spherical triangles. They are symmetric each to other and grouped with a common vertex around the normal vector to the surface. The hemispherical integration domain is completed with more 8 sub-domains of equal size spherical quadrangles, also symmetric each to other. All sub-domains have fixed vertices and computable parameters. The bijections of unit square into an orthogonal spherical triangle and into a spherical quadrangle are derived and used to generate sampling points. Then, the <b>symmetric</b> <b>sampling</b> scheme is applied to generate the sampling points distributed over the hemispherical integration domain.

The model uses two assumptions: {{a large number of}} sampling points in the flow field and a <b>symmetric</b> <b>sampling</b> region around the origin. The algorithm estimates self-rotation parameters by calculating statistics whose expectations correspond to the rotation parameters. After the rotational components are removed from the retinal flow, the heading direction is recovered from the flow field. Performance of the model was compared with human data in three psychophysical experiments. In the first experiment, we generated stimuli which simulated self-motion toward the ground, a cloud or a frontoparallel plane and found that the simulation results of the model were consistent with human performance. In the second and third experiment, we measured the slope of the perceived versus simulated heading function when a perturbation velocity weighted according to the distance relative to the fixation distance was added to the vertical velocity component under the cloud condition. It was found that as the magnitude of the perturbation was increased, the slope of the function increased.

40|$|Disequilibrium mapping is an {{essential}} tool {{in the identification of}} genes underlying complex traits. DNA pooling is a technique that allows one to perform a case-control association study without genotyping the individual DNA samples, but rather a single pool of cases and a single pool of controls. Selecting from the extremes of the trait distribution for analysis greatly enhances power in a sample. However, from where in the trait distribution should we select the two pools, to achieve optimal power in a sample? Through analytical derivation and optimisation, we provide robust guidelines for optimal pooling fractions. Our studies suggest that in the absence of experimental error a <b>symmetric</b> <b>sampling</b> scheme of genotyping individuals from the 20 - 30 % tails of the trait distribution is optimal under a variety of possible genetic models underlying the trait of interest. We also consider the effects of experimental noise from sources such as measurement error and unequal DNA contribution from individuals.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the interplay between discrete-time and continuous-time signals and the question, whether certain {{properties}} of the signal in one domain carry {{over to the other}} domain. The Shannon sampling series and the more general Valiron interpolation series are the appropriate means to obtain the continuous-time, bandlimited signal out of its samples, i. e., the discrete-time signal. Furthermore, we investigate the <b>symmetric</b> <b>sampling</b> series and the behavior of the non-symmetric sampling series, which follows from the properties of the projection operator. It is well known, that the space of discrete-time signals with finite energy and the space of continuous- time, bandlimited signals with finite energy are isomorphic. Thus, discrete-time and continuous-time, bandlimited signals with finite energy can be used interchangeably. This interchangeability is not restricted to finite energy signals. It is valid for a considerably larger class, but not for the space of bounded signals: Even if the discrete-time signal is bounded, the corresponding bandlimited interpolation can be unbounded. For the proof we explicitly state such a bounded discrete-time signal. Furthermore, we show not only that the Shannon sampling series diverges for this signal, but also that there is no bounded, bandlimited interpolation at all...|$|E

I use a novel dataset of consumer online browsing and purchasing behavior, which tracks all consumer search prior to each transaction. Using observed search intensities from the online book industry, I estimate search cost distributions that allow for asymmetric consumer sampling. Research on consumer search often assumes a <b>symmetric</b> <b>sampling</b> rule for analytical convenience despite its lack of realism. Search behavior in the online book industry is quite limited: in only 25 percen of the transactions did consumers visit more than one bookstore's website. The industry is characterized by a strong consumer preference for certain retailers. Accounting for unequal consumer sampling halves the search cost estimates from 1. 8 to 0. 9 dollars per search in the online book industry. Analysis of time spent online suggests substitution between the time consumers spend searching and the relative opportunity cost of their time. Retired people, those with lower education levels, and minorities (with the exception of Hispanics) spent significantly more time searching for a book online. There is a negative relationship between income levels and time spent searching. consumer search, internet, search costs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Projective {{clustering}} is {{a problem}} with both theoretical and practical importance and has received a great deal of attentions in recent years. Given a set of points P in Rd space, projective clustering is to find a set F of k lower dimensional j-flats so that the average distance (or squared distance) from points in P to their closest flats is minimized. Existing approaches for this problem are mainly based on adaptive/volume sampling or core-sets techniques which suffer from several limitations. In this paper, we present the first uniform random sampling based approach for this challenging problem and achieve linear time solutions for three cases, general projective clustering, regular projective clustering, and Lτ sense projective clustering. For the general projective clustering problem, we show that for any given small numbers 0 < γ, < 1, our approach first removes γ|P | points as outliers and then determines k j-flats to cluster the remaining points into k clusters with an objective value no more than (1 +) times of the optimal for all points. For regular projective clustering, we demonstrate that when the input points satisfy some reasonable assumption on its input, our approach for the general case can be extended to yield a PTAS for all points. For Lτ sense projective clustering, we show that our techniques for both the general and regular cases can be naturally extended to the Lτ sense projective clustering problem for any 1 ≤ τ < ∞. Our results are based on several novel techniques, such as slab partition, ∆-rotation, <b>symmetric</b> <b>sampling,</b> and recursive projection, and can be easily implemented for applications. ar X i...|$|E
40|$|The ING Domestic Bank {{possesses}} around 22 % {{market share}} of Dutch mortgages. Normally, mortgage customers {{have to pay the}} interest or deposit monthly. But somehow, a considerable number of customers repay late, or default for one or even several months, which brings tremendous losses to ING. The Arrears department manages the arrears of mortgage payments, and it contacts defaulters by letters, SMS, Emails or phone calls. Comparing with the existing working process, the Arrears department aims at to make the treatments more intensive in order to push defaulters to repay as soon as possible, while keeping the current operational cost. We develop a classification model to predict the behaviour of the mortgage customers who were healthy in the last month but do not pay the debt {{at the beginning of the}} current month. One label with two possible values is assigned by our model: the delayers, who just pay late but not exceeding 1 month, and defaulters, who do not pay even at the end of the month. In this way, the Arrears department can only treat defaulters intensively, who really have payment problems. In this project, 400, 000 customers with more than 2, 000 features are collected from the ING data warehouse. Feature selection and data preprocessing are executed first. Then, we train several popular basic classifiers such as KNN, Naive Bayes, decision trees, logistic regression, and also some ensemble methods like bagging, random forests, boosting, voting and stacking. Since the two classes are highly imbalanced (the ratio of defaulters to delayers is around 1 : 9), we discuss the evaluation metrics of skewed data learning. The Area under the ROC curve is employed to compare the results of different classifiers. Besides, the impacts of sampling techniques are empirically studied as well. Our experiments show that ensemble methods increase the performance of basic classifiers remarkably. We also conclude that <b>symmetric</b> <b>sampling</b> improves the classification performance. Balanced random forests is chosen to build the model for the Arrears department, which gives an AUC value of around 0. 772. The model has already been deployed into the daily work of the Arrears department of the ING domestic bank since June 2013. Finally, cost matrix analysis and feature importance ranking are studied in order to guide the daily work of the Arrears department and give a deep insight to this problem.
