Devereux was again appointed on 2 July 1377 as Justice of the Peace for Herefordshire., and on 20 July, following the death of Edward III and ascension of Richard II, he was also among those assigned as keepers of the city of Hereford. They were instructed to stay upon its sage custody and for conservation of the peace therein, with full power to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> men of the city and suburbs, according to their condition and means, are suitably armed, arrayed, and kept ready to resist the king’s enemies, compelling them if need be, by distress or imprisonment.|$|E

500|$|Because rehearsals did {{not start}} until October 1874 and lasted longer than anticipated, the premiere was delayed. The final rehearsals went well, and in a {{generally}} optimistic mood the first night was fixed for 3 March 1875, the day on which, coincidentally, Bizet's appointment as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour was formally announced. The premiere, which was conducted by Adolphe Deloffre, was attended by many of Paris's leading musical figures, including Massenet, Offenbach, Delibes and Gounod; during the performance the last-named was overheard complaining bitterly that Bizet had stolen the music of Micaëla's act 3 aria from him: [...] "That melody is mine!" [...] Halévy recorded his impressions of the premiere {{in a letter to}} a friend; the first act was evidently well received, with applause for the main numbers and numerous curtain calls. The first part of act 2 also went well, but after the toreador's song there was, Halévy noted, [...] "coldness". In act 3 only Micaëla's aria earned applause as the audience became increasingly disconcerted. The final act was [...] "glacial from first to last", and Bizet was left [...] "only with the consolations of a few friends". The critic Ernest Newman wrote later that the sentimentalist Opéra-Comique audience was [...] "shocked by the drastic realism of the action" [...] and by the low standing and defective morality of most of the characters. According to the composer Benjamin Godard, Bizet retorted, in response to a compliment, [...] "Don't you <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> these bourgeois have not understood a wretched word of the work I have written for them?" [...] In a different vein, shortly after the work had concluded, Massenet sent Bizet a congratulatory note: [...] "How happy you must be at this time—it's a great success!".|$|E

2500|$|Despite its name, {{mathematical}} induction {{is a method}} of deduction, not a form of inductive reasoning. In proof by {{mathematical induction}}, a single [...] "base case" [...] is proved, and an [...] "induction rule" [...] is proved that establishes that any arbitrary case implies the next case. Since in principle the induction rule can be applied repeatedly starting from the proved base case, we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> (usually infinitely many) cases are provable. This avoids having to prove each case individually. A variant of mathematical induction is proof by infinite descent, which can be used, for example, to prove the irrationality of the square root of two.|$|E

The commission meets twice each month at Old City Hall in Old Town. The city commission appoints a city manager to serve at will for an infinite term. The main duty of the manager is to implement policy set by the city commission and manage the operations of the city on a daily basis. The city manager is to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> laws, provisions of the city charter, and any acts of the city commission are executed and enforced.

2500|$|Rabbi Israel Lipschitz of Danzig (19th century) gave {{a famous}} lecture on Torah and paleontology, which is {{printed in the}} Yachin u-Boaz edition of the Mishnah, after Massechet Sanhedrin. He writes that Kabbalistic texts teach {{that the world has}} gone through many cycles of history, each lasting for many tens of {{thousands}} of years. He links these teachings to findings about geology from European, American and Asian geologists, and from findings from paleontologists. [...] He discusses the wooly mammoth discovered in 1807 Siberia, Russia, and the remains of several then-famous dinosaur skeletons recently unearthed. [...] Finding no contradiction between this and Jewish teachings, he states [...] "From all this, we can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the Kabbalists have told us for so many centuries about the fourfold destruction and renewal of the Earth has found its clearest possible confirmation in our time." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{television}} show Roger Ebert & the Movies, director Martin Scorsese named Eyes Wide Shut his fourth-favorite film of the 1990s. For the introduction to Michel Ciment's Kubrick: The Definitive Edition, Scorsese wrote: [...] "When Eyes Wide Shut came out {{a few months after}} Stanley Kubrick's death in 1999, it was severely misunderstood, which came as no surprise. If you {{go back and look at}} the contemporary reactions to any Kubrick picture (except the earliest ones), you'll <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> his films were initially misunderstood. Then, after five or ten years came the realization that [...] or Barry Lyndon or The Shining was like nothing else before or since." [...] Mystery writer and commentator Jon Breen agreed. In 2012, Slant Magazine ranked the film as the second greatest of the 1990s. The BBC listed it number 61 in its list of the 100 greatest American films of all time.|$|E
