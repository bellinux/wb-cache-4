25|$|The {{military}} tribunal considered guilt and sentencing on June 29 and 30. Surratt's guilt was the second-last to be considered, as her case had problems {{of evidence and}} witness reliability. The sentence was handed down on June 30. The {{military tribunal}} found her guilty on all charges but two. A death sentence required six of the nine votes of the judges. Surratt was sentenced to death, the first woman executed by the federal government. The sentence was announced publicly on July 5. When Powell learned of his sentence, he declared that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> innocent of all charges. The night before the execution, Surratt's priests and Anna Surratt both visited Powell and elicited from him a strong statement declaring Mary innocent. Although it was delivered to Captain Christian Rath, who was overseeing the execution, Powell's statement {{had no effect on}} anyone with authority to prevent Surratt's death. George Atzerodt bitterly condemned her, implicating her even further in the conspiracy. Powell's was the only statement by any conspirator exonerating Surratt.|$|E
25|$|She {{was persuaded}} {{to return to}} work in 1914 for her company (Victor Film Company), which had been {{acquired}} by Universal Studios. During the filming of Pawns of Destiny in 1915, a staged fire got out of control. Lawrence was burned, her hair was singed, and she suffered a serious fall which fractured her spine. She went into shock for months. She returned to work, but collapsed after the film was completed. Blaming Solter for making her do the stunt in which she was injured, the two divorced. To add to her problems, Universal refused to pay her medical expenses, leaving Lawrence feeling betrayed. In mid-1916, she returned to work for Universal and completed another feature film, Elusive Isabel. However, the strain of working took its toll on her and she suffered a serious relapse. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> paralyzed for four months. In 1921, she traveled to Hollywood to attempt a comeback, but had little success. She received a leading role in a minor melodrama (The Unfoldment), and then two supporting roles. All her film work after 1924 would be in uncredited bit parts.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, {{she married}} flamenco singer Pepe Pinto. After the {{parenthesis}} of the Spanish Civil War, {{she came back}} to the stage, as part of several flamenco shows, together with artists like Concha Piquer. After this, she retired for a few years, and came back with a show called España y su Cantaora (Spain and her singer), together with her husband, which she toured for a few months and was acclaimed by the critics. Then she definitely retired again. In 1961 she received an homage in Córdoba, in which several well-known flamenco artists took part, such as Antonio Mairena, Juan Talega, Manuel Morao, or Fernando Terremoto. In 1968, a monument was built in her honour in her quarter of Alameda de Hércules. In the last three years of her life, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> retired owing to senile dementia. She died in 1969, {{a month and a half}} after her husband. In that same year, singer Anotnio Mairena recorded his album Honores a la Niña de los Peines in homage to her. In 1996, during the IX Bienal de Flamenco, the autonomous Andalusian government declared the voice of La Niña de los Peines Bien de Interés Cultural (Asset of Cultural Interest).|$|E

500|$|Kaiser Karl der Grosse {{served with}} the active fleet until 1908, {{participating}} in the normal peacetime routine of training cruises and fleet maneuvers. By 1908, the new [...] "all-big-gun" [...] dreadnought battleships were entering service. As <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> obsolete, Kaiser Karl der Grosse was withdrawn from active service {{and placed in the}} Reserve Division. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the ship was placed back in active duty as a coastal defense ship in the V Battle Squadron, though by February 1915 she was again placed in reserve. Kaiser Karl der Grosse was briefly used as a training ship and ended her career as a prison ship for prisoners of war in Wilhelmshaven. Following the German defeat in November 1918, she was sold to ship-breakers and scrapped in 1920.|$|E
500|$|She {{personally}} {{taught her}} own children and exposed them to new ideas and inventions. She gave lessons to her younger son, Louis, until he was ten years of age.

With his assistance and the addition of a few contemporary producers, she was able to make a subtle transition into the R market. Daydream was nominated for six Grammy Awards at the 38th annual ceremony, during which Carey performed live. Due to the album's critical and commercial success, critics believed Carey would be one of the night's big winners.

500|$|While {{working on}} the album, ideas began to {{circulate}} concerning Rihanna's image, extending into her music videos. She asked American music video director Chris Applebaum to send her [...] "something" [...] to work on. Def Jam representatives were expecting Applebaum of the treatment. In response, Applebaum hurriedly made a treatment for the video, {{one of his first}} ideas being the silver body paint that Rihanna is seen in. Applebaum was doubtful whether Rihanna would embrace the idea, but her [...] "positive response" [...] following a letter the director sent to the artist ensured its approval. Makeup artist Pamela Neal mixed a silver paint that would give Rihanna such a look. During the session, the paint was re-applied between takes to ensure <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> covered. The set was closed to Rihanna, Applebaum and a camera assistant. Rihanna also contributed her own ideas towards the video shoot, suggesting to Applebaum that she dance en pointe, an idea which he accepted.|$|E
500|$|In total, nine battlecruisers {{survived the}} Washington Naval Treaty, {{although}} HMS Tiger {{later became a}} victim of the London Naval Conference of 1930 and was scrapped. Because their high speed made them valuable surface units in spite of their weaknesses, most of these ships were significantly updated before World War II. [...] and [...] were modernized significantly in the 1920s and 1930s. Between 1934 and 1936, Repulse was partially modernized and had her bridge modified, an aircraft hangar, catapult and new gunnery equipment added and her anti-aircraft armament increased. Renown underwent a more thorough reconstruction between 1937 and 1939. Her deck armour was increased, new turbines and boilers were fitted, an aircraft hangar and catapult added and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> rearmed aside from the main guns which had their elevation increased to +30 degrees. The bridge structure was also removed and a large bridge similar to that used in the [...] battleships installed in its place. While conversions of this kind generally added weight to the vessel, Renowns tonnage actually decreased due to a substantially lighter power plant. Similar thorough rebuildings planned for Repulse and Hood were cancelled due to the advent of World War II.|$|E
500|$|Hutton {{stated that}} Murray had treated her source {{material}} with [...] "reckless abandon", {{in that she}} had taken [...] "vivid details of alleged witch practices" [...] from [...] "sources scattered across a great extent of space and time" [...] and then declared them to be normative of the cult as a whole. Simpson outlined how Murray had selected her use of evidence very specifically, particularly by ignoring and/or rationalising any accounts of supernatural or miraculous events in the trial records, thereby distorting the events that she was describing. Thus, Simpson pointed out, Murray rationalised claims that the cloven-hoofed Devil appeared at the witches' Sabbath by stating {{that he was a}} man with a special kind of shoe, and similarly asserted that witches' claims to have flown through the air on broomsticks were actually based on their practice of either hopping along on broomsticks or smearing hallucinogenic salves onto themselves. Concurring with this assessment, the historian Jeffrey Burton Russell, writing with the independent author Brooks Alexander, stated that [...] "Murray's use of sources, in general, is appalling". The pair went on to claim that [...] "today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong– <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises".|$|E

500|$|Yugoslavia had {{initially}} {{been given the}} ships of the old Austro-Hungarian Navy after {{the dissolution of the}} Empire in the closing days of World War I, but the Allied powers quickly seized the majority of the ships and allocated them to the various Allied countries. Left with only twelve modern torpedo boats, Yugoslavia sought more powerful vessels. The Royal Yugoslav Navy therefore purchased Niobe when Germany placed her for sale in 1925. Renamed Dalmacija (Dalmatia), <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> rearmed in 1926 before she entered Yugoslavian service, though the details are uncertain. According to Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, she was equipped with six Škoda 8.5cm /55 quick-firing guns, and initially four and later six [...] anti-aircraft guns were added. But naval historian Milan Vego states that she carried six [...] L/35 anti-aircraft guns, four 47mm guns, and six machine guns. After entering service, Dalmacija was employed as a gunnery training ship. In May and June 1929, Dalmacija, the submarines [...] and , the submarine tender [...] and six torpedo boats went on a cruise to Malta, the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea, and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia. According to the British naval attaché, the ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.|$|E
500|$|Elworthy {{suggested}} that the Ooser was a depiction of the Devil, an idea supported by Dewar, who believed that, as the Devil, its imagery was [...] "intended to inspire terror {{in the minds of}} the foolish and the wicked". Conversely, others have {{suggested that}} it is a depiction of a pre-Christian god. In her 1931 book The God of the Witches, Margaret Murray connected the Ooser to her version of the witch-cult hypothesis—the idea that those persecuted in the Early Modern witch trials were adherents of a surviving pre-Christian fertility religion—claiming that the mask was a cult item that reflected continuing worship of the cult's Horned God. Murray's hypothesis is now discredited. The historians Jeffrey B. Russell and Brooks Alexander have stated that [...] "today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong [...] <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises". The Ooser's pre-Christian origin theory was echoed in the Reader's Digest encyclopedia of British folklore, Folklore, Myths and Legends of Britain, where it was described as [...] "the idol of a former god of fertility". Although not believing that the Ooser was a specific depiction of a surviving pre-Christian deity, Dewar {{suggested that the}} imagery of the Devil, and thus of the Ooser, was originally drawn from the pre-Christian gods of [...] "phallic or fertility worship".|$|E
500|$|Gemma Arterton as MI6 agent Strawberry Fields, {{who works}} at the British {{consulate}} in Bolivia. Fields, who is merely an office worker as described by M, takes herself seriously and tries to overpower Bond when the pair meet. She is later seduced by Bond, infiltrates Greene's fund raiser party with him and ends up paying the ultimate price. Forster found Arterton a witty actress and selected her from a reported 1,500 candidates. One of the casting directors asked her to audition for the role, having seen her portray Rosaline in Love's Labour's Lost at the Globe Theatre. Arterton said Fields was [...] "not so frolicsome" [...] as other Bond girls, but is instead [...] "fresh and young, not... a femme fatale." [...] Arterton described Fields as a homage to the 1960s Bond girls, comparing her red wig to that of Diana Rigg, who played Tracy Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Rigg, alongside Honor Blackman, is one of her favourite Bond girls. Arterton had to film her character's death scene first day on the set, where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> covered head to toe in non-toxic black paint. Although she found the experience unpleasant, she believes the scene will be an iconic part of the film. The character's full name, which is a reference to the Beatles song [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", is never actually uttered on screen; when Bond asks her for her name, she replies, [...] "Just Fields." [...] Robert A. Caplen suggests that this is a conscious effort to portray a woman [...] "whose character attributes are neither undermined nor compromised" [...] by her name, even though her name may have sexual overtones reminiscent of earlier Bond girls.|$|E

The first was a [...] weapon dropped by a Hellcat that exploded on the roof of her [...] "Bruno" [...] main gun turret. The explosion destroyed the quadruple [...] anti-aircraft gun mount located on top of the turret, but did not cause any significant damage to the turret itself. The second bomb to strike the ship was a [...] armour-piercing weapon which penetrated through five decks, killed a sailor in a radio room and lodged near an electrical switch room. This bomb failed to explode, and German bomb disposal experts later determined that it had been only partially filled with explosives. The German report on the attack judged that if the bomb had gone off it would have caused [...] "immeasurable" [...] damage. British fighters also attacked other German ships and facilities in the Kaafjord area, damaging two patrol boats, a minesweeper and a radar station, as well as destroying an ammunition dump and three guns of an anti-aircraft battery. Tirpitzs last remaining Arado Ar 196 seaplane was attacked in Bukta harbour and damaged beyond repair. Four Corsairs and two Hellcats were shot down during the raid, and the battleship's crew suffered 8 fatalities and 18 men wounded. Casualties among the anti-aircraft units stationed around Kaafjord were heavy.|$|E

She explained, [...] "I'm so excited – this is my directorial debut. I am just thrilled that my fans are going to be in the theatre with me and I can't wait for everyone to see it. It took me nine months to edit because I wanted to show a little bit of each show, each performance on tour, and it was 116 shows, so you can only imagine how much work it was, [...] it was worth it."
