5|$|Floating {{storage and}} {{offloading}} units (FSO) are used worldwide by the offshore oil industry to receive oil from nearby platforms and <b>store</b> <b>it</b> until {{it can be}} offloaded onto oil tankers. A similar system, the floating production storage and offloading unit (FPSO), {{has the ability to}} process the product while it is on board. These floating units reduce oil production costs and offer mobility, large storage capacity, and production versatility.|$|E

5|$|The {{interactions}} of hydrogen with various metals {{are very important}} in metallurgy, as many metals can suffer hydrogen embrittlement, and in developing safe ways to <b>store</b> <b>it</b> {{for use as a}} fuel. Hydrogen is highly soluble in many compounds composed of rare earth metals and transition metals and can be dissolved in both crystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the metal crystal lattice.|$|E
5|$|British law {{requires}} that temazepam (but not midazolam) be stored in safe custody. Safe custody requirements ensures that pharmacists and doctors holding stock of temazepam must <b>store</b> <b>it</b> in securely fixed double-locked steel safety cabinets and maintain a written register, which must be bound and contain separate entries for temazepam and must be written in ink with no use of correction fluid (although a written register is not required for temazepam in the United Kingdom). Disposal of expired stock must be witnessed by a designated inspector (either a local drug-enforcement police officer or official from health authority). Benzodiazepine abuse ranges from occasional binges on large doses, to chronic and compulsive drug abuse of high doses.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, {{all three}} members of the class were {{modified}} to carry a pair of float planes for reconnaissance. They were equipped with an aircraft catapult to launch the planes and cranes to recover them after they landed in the water. The ships initially carried two Heinkel He 60 biplane float planes, replaced later in the decade with two Arado Ar 196 monoplane float planes. Only one aircraft could be stored on the catapult at a time; the second plane had to be disassembled and placed in storage, and the ships did not have a hangar to <b>store</b> <b>it</b> in.|$|E

It was released in Japan on May 30, 2003 and in North America on July 11, 2004, but only through the New York Pokémon Center and its online <b>store.</b> <b>It</b> is no longer available in either location. The game was released {{in some parts of}} Europe as Pokémon Memory Magic due to translation problems, and Europeans only could get the game by using points from Nintendo of Europe's loyalty program, or by buying the Pokémon Colosseum Mega Pack.|$|E

Through wood export, the wasp can spread to East Asia, West Australia {{and parts of}} Africa. Remote locations, such as the Horn of Africa, may be spared from the Sirex woodwasp, providing the area is controlled. The Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) of the IUCN has graded the wasp as heavily invasive.|$|E
5|$|The {{department}} store Liberty {{is on the}} corner of Great Marlborough Street and Regent Street. The founder, Arthur Lasenby Liberty, was unable to expand or modernise the existing shop front due to Crown planning restrictions, so he bought numerous properties on Great Marlborough Street in 1925, and rebuilt them in a Mock Tudor design {{as an extension of the}} <b>store.</b> <b>It</b> was Grade II* listed in 1972. Palladium House was built {{on the corner of}} Great Marlborough Street and Argyll Street in 1928 by Raymond Hood and Gordon Jeeves. It featured an Art Deco design inspired by the Paris Exhibition of 1925 and was extended in 1935. It is now a Grade II listed building.|$|E

5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, {{it would not have been}} a good idea to <b>store</b> <b>it</b> for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are large}} {{deposits}} of petroleum (as {{oil and natural}} gas) in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and <b>store</b> <b>it</b> for transport to land. Offshore {{oil and gas production}} can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead, and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage and oil may be spilt.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers often receive inquiries and demands about their investigations that stem from unrealistic portrayals on television. In a 2010 survey of Canadian police officers, some were frustrated by these CSI-affected queries, though most {{saw them as}} opportunities {{to inform the public}} about real police work. New technologies and the increased public awareness of forensic science have stimulated new interest in solving cold cases and encouraged higher accountability among police investigators. However, the increased demand for forensic evidence can cause an unmanageable workload for forensic laboratories. Some crime labs process several thousand cases every year. Many law enforcement agencies have insufficient storage space for the increasing amount of physical evidence they collect. In some investigations, DNA evidence is not collected simply because there is not enough space to <b>store</b> <b>it</b> properly.|$|E

5|$|Australian ravens are {{intelligent}} birds, {{and like}} many other corvids have innovative methods of seeking out food. Foraging {{takes place in the}} early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day. Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either finding objects while flying overhead, or by walking along and looking. However, they occasionally feed in trees—Australian ravens forage eucalypt foliage for Christmas beetles (Anoplognathus), and devote a substantial amount of time to look for nests and eggs to eat. They have also been known to take golf balls from fairways, possibly mistaking them for eggs. Ravens use their bill rather than their feet to explore or turn items on the ground (rocks or sticks) over, or hold or snatch food while flying. They have also been recorded using fence posts as anvils to bash snails against before eating them. Australian ravens most often eat food where they find it unless taking food back for nestlings. Occasionally they have been observed caching carrion or a killed animal in a hole nearby to <b>store</b> <b>it.</b> They can pack shredded meat in their mouth under their tongue. Australian ravens have adapted well to eating food scraps in urban areas, such as school playgrounds, rubbish tips, bins outside supermarkets or restaurants, abattoirs, piggeries and farmyards. In one isolated study, they were observed feeding on nectar from eucalypt flowers. Australian ravens sometimes forage in mixed-species flocks with any of the other four species of Australian corvids. Sometimes they are aggressive with little ravens if both are at a food source and drive them off, though not if the smaller species greatly outnumbers the larger.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster was {{released}} {{as a collection}} for the PlayStation 3 and as separate releases of each game for the PlayStation Vita. Alongside the standard PlayStation Vita releases in Japan, there was a Twin Pack that bundled both games and a Resolution Box collection which additionally contained the handheld console. A dual release was decided against for the Vita versions due to the limited storage capacity of the cartridges. Play Arts Kai figurines of Tidus and Yuna were produced and the original soundtracks were re-released. Two new Ultimania guide books were published for each game. Nojima wrote the tie-in novel Final Fantasy X-2.5: Eien no Daishō that bridges the gap between Last Mission and Final Fantasy X: Will. A Collector's Edition of the PlayStation 3 version was exclusively released in North America via Square Enix's online <b>store.</b> <b>It</b> contained both games, an artwork book, a Blu-ray disc for the rearranged soundtrack and five artwork lithographs. A special launch event was held at Gallery Nucleus in Alhambra, California during March 2014. It included a signing event with Kitase and Naora, and an artwork auction with all profits going {{to the victims of}} Typhoon Haiyan. The PlayStation 4 port of the remaster, officially announced at a PlayStation conference in China on December 11, 2014, was originally leaked in Square Enix France's online store earlier that same day. The PS4 release supports save transfers from the PS3 and Vita versions, remote play on the Vita, switching between the original and remastered soundtracks and further enhanced graphics now in full HD (1080p) with non-player NPCs and monsters receiving further treatment. It {{was released}} worldwide on PS4 in May 2015. It was later released on Microsoft Windows via Steam in May 2016 with an auto-save feature, 5 game boosters, 3 parameter changes, 4K resolution support, graphic and audio settings and the option to skip FMVs.|$|E
