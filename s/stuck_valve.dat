Spoilers alleviate the situation by allowing the aircraft to descend at a desired rate while letting the engine run at a power setting that keeps it from cooling too quickly (especially true for turbocharged piston engines, which generate higher temperatures than normally aspirated engines).|$|R
5000|$|On 25 July 1962, {{a second}} {{attempt was made}} to launch the Bluegill device, but ended in {{disaster}} when the Thor suffered a <b>stuck</b> <b>valve</b> preventing the flow of LOX to the combustion chamber.

With the Thor engulfed in flames, the Range Safety Officer sent the destruct command, which split the rocket and ruptured both fuel tanks, completely destroying the missile and badly damaging the launch pad. The warhead charges also exploded asymmetrically and sprayed the area with the moderately radioactive core materials.|$|E
50|$|Although a {{clean and}} unoiled valve of a well {{maintained}} instrument should move without unusual force, {{the inside of a}} musical instrument is a very inhospitable environment for a delicate valve mechanism. The musician constantly blows warm moist air through the valve. To make matters worse, impurities may be blown from the musician's mouth into the instrument. Even if nothing grows in the valve, the condensation and changing temperature of the metal can cause an untreated valve to bind, possibly resulting in a <b>stuck</b> <b>valve.</b> Even a minor binding of a valve affects the playability of the instrument and is at least very annoying. Also, woodwind musicians use valve oil (called key oil for woodwinds since they do not have valves, they have keys) to lubricate the mechanism of the keys to improve the springback action. However, woodwinds usually oil their keys only every few months, whereas some brass players lubricate their valves several times a week.|$|E

It had to be left standing because officials couldn't be sure the bacteria were truly gone. In fact, a large spill did occur in Building 470 in 1958. A technician, trying to pry open a <b>stuck</b> <b>valve</b> {{at the bottom of}} a fermentor, unintentionally released approximately 2,000 gallons of liquid B. anthracis culture. Because of the design of the building and the safety measures in place, it was possible to isolate the spill to one room. There was no contamination of Fort Detrick or the local community, and no one (including the technician) became ill. The outcome of the incident was taken to indicate the effectiveness of the biological safety practices pioneered during the early days of “bioweaponeering” at Fort Detrick.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{estimate}} {{that as much}} as 50 % of packaged air conditioning systems operate in faulty conditions that degrade system efficiency. Common faults include: under- and over-charged systems (too much or too little refrigerant), faulty expansions <b>valves</b> (<b>stuck</b> <b>valves,</b> valve hunting, poorly tuned valve controllers), and fouled evaporators and condensers. Furthermore, air conditioning systems can often be adjusted to improve efficiency while continuing to meet cooling loads (adjusting system pressures, decreasing superheat setpoints). This study presents the design of a low cost device that can non-invasively measure system operating conditions, diagnose faults, estimate potential energy savings, and provide recommendations on how the system should be adjusted or repaired. Using eight external temperature measurements, the device potentially can detect and diagnose up to ten faults commonly found in HVAC systems. Steady state temperatures are compared to threshold values obtained from literature and HVAC manufacturers to detect and determine the severity of faults and subsequent reductions in coefficient of performance. Preliminary tests reveal the potential for the device to detect and diagnose common efficiency-degrading faults in HVAC systems...|$|R

50|$|In 1996, Voas {{revealed}} all of America’s {{nuclear power}} plant reactor vessels are inexorably weakening and often cracking ~ posing a risk of ruptures that could spew radioactivity. The nuclear reactions in our 100+ power plants are contained in steel reactor vessels that are 4-story pressure cookers. They must never rupture. What no one knew when they built the mammoth plants is that when steel is bombarded by radioactivity, it becomes fragile and cracked. When Voas was at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Maryland, {{she picked up a}} tidbit of information and pursued it for months. There is no way to replace the gargantuan highly-radioactive vessels, nor any proven method to fix the increasing fragility of the steel. Utilities are all hoping to keep renewing their operation licenses for 40 years beyond their original operating licenses. But the longer the plants run, the more fragile the steel reactor vessels become.  NRC regulators said the increasing fragility of the steel raises the risk that something as small as a <b>stuck</b> <b>valve</b> may cause them to break open and spew radioactive materials into the environment, as happened at the Three-Mile Island. nuclear plant.|$|E
50|$|On December 12, {{the second}} attempt {{to launch a}} {{complete}} Titan (Missile C-2) took place at LC-16. One pad umbilical failed to detach at ignition, and an automatic shutoff signal terminated thrust before the missile could be released by the launcher mechanism. Ground crews quickly repaired the umbilical, and a second launch attempt was made two days later. Their relief at having avoided certain disaster on December 12 was short-lived when the Titan exploded {{almost as soon as}} it was released by the launcher mechanism. The mishap was quickly traced to the Range Safety destruct charges on the first stage inadvertently going off, as Martin technicians had moved the activator relay into a vibration-prone area during repair work on the missile. Testing confirmed that the shock from the pad hold-down bolts firing was enough to set off the relay. Because the RSO charges had spilled out the propellants and minimized mixing of them, the explosion was not as powerful as that of Titan B-5, and so damage to LC-16 was less extensive. The pad was repaired in only two months. On February 2, 1960, LC-19 returned to action as Missile B-7 marked the first successful flight of a Titan with a live upper stage. On February 5, LC-16 returned to action by hosting Missile C-4. The second attempt at a Lot C Titan failed at T+52 seconds when the guidance compartment collapsed, causing the RVX-3 reentry vehicle to separate. The missile pitched down and the first stage LOX tank ruptured from aerodynamic loads, blowing the stage to pieces. After the first stage destroyed itself, the second stage separated and began engine ignition, sensing that normal staging had taken place. With no attitude control, it began tumbling end-over-end and quickly lost thrust. The stage plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean some 30-40 miles downrange. After the successful flight of Missile G-4 on February 24, Missile C-1's second stage failed to ignite on March 8 due to a <b>stuck</b> <b>valve</b> preventing the gas generator from starting. On July 1, the newly opened LC-20 hosted its first launch when Missile J-2, an operational prototype, was flown. Unfortunately, a broken hydraulic line caused the Titan's engines to gimbal hard left almost as soon as the tower was cleared. The missile pitched over and flew onto a near-horizontal plane when Range Safety sent the destruct command at T+11 seconds. The burning remains of the Titan impacted 300 meters from the pad in an enormous fireball. The piece of plumbing responsible for the missile failure was retrieved—it had popped out of its sleeve resulting in loss of first stage hydraulic pressure. The sleeve was not tight enough to hold the hydraulic line in place, and the pressure being imparted into it at liftoff was enough to pop it loose. Examination of other Titan missiles found more defective hydraulic lines, and the Missile J-2 debacle caused a wholesale review of manufacturing processes and improved parts testing.|$|E

40|$|We {{combine a}} {{previously}} developed strategy for Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) with a supervisory controller in closed loop. The combined method {{is applied to}} {{a model of a}} pilot-scale cooling loop of a nuclear plant, which includes Kalman filters and a model-based predictive controller as part of normal operation. The system has two valves available for flow control meaning that some redundancy is available. The FDI method is based on likelihood ratios for different fault scenarios which in turn are derived from the application of the Kalman filter. A previously introduced extension of the FDI method is used here to enable detection and identification of non-linear faults like <b>stuck</b> <b>valve</b> problems and proper accounting of the time of fault introduction. The supervisory control system is designed so to take different kinds of actions depending on the status of the fault diagnosis task and on the type of identified fault once diagnosis is complete. Some faults, like sensor bias and drift, are parametric in nature and can be adjusted without need for reconfiguration of the regulatory control system. Other faults, like a <b>stuck</b> <b>valve</b> problem, require reconfiguration of the regulatory control system. The whole strategy is demonstrated for several scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Because of {{environmental}} pollution, forces {{the automotive industry}} constantly reduced emissions requirements legislated by the authorities. Improved techniques for engine control are a must for bringing down emissions. The use of an Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) reduces NOx emissions significantly. Faulty EGR valves affect the emissions negative and therefore needs to be eliminated. It is possible to create malfunctions on the EGR valve by modifying the software of the control unit (ECU), {{but it does not}} create realistic malfunctions. The problem by modifying the software is that flags and various parameters are set to confirm the malfunction of the ECU. To create actual failure of the EGR valve an external tool to modify the control signal is needed. The project's main objective is on a flexible way creating malfunctions on the EGR valve in a truck engine. By investigating engine behavior in a realistic and credible way, one can eliminate malfunctions on the EGR valve. The aim was achieved by a model that has been developed that can, using electronics and a microprocessor read and create a control signal. The electronic circuit is controlled by the microprocessor, which can modify the signal and create malfunctions {{in the form of a}} slow valve "slow-response". A graphical user interface is used to change and influence the error signal. The circuit with the microprocessor is placed safely in a box to both protect and preserve the components. Simulation of Slow response has resulted in an incorrect operated valve being created. Using two different methods a Slow-response can be created. One method is a delay in time, which occurs when the new position is given, the second method is a ramp function when the control signal is gradually increasing. The software can also create an error that mimics a <b>stuck</b> <b>valve</b> of a fixed value. With the above listed methods it is possible in theory to find unknown malfunctions on the EGR valve that influence emissions negatively. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and safety of thrombolytic therapy in stuck mitral bileaflet heart valves in the absence of high-risk thrombi. BACKGROUNDCurrent recommendations for the thrombolytic treatment of <b>stuck</b> prosthetic mitral <b>valves</b> are partially based on older valve models and inclusion of patients in whom high-risk thrombi were either ignored or not sought for. The feasibility and safety of thrombolysis in bileaflet models may be affected by the predilection of thrombi to catch the leaflet hinge. METHODSWe studied 12 consecutive patients (men/women = 5 / 7, age 58. 8 ± 14. 9 years) who experienced one or more episodes of <b>stuck</b> bileaflet mitral <b>valve</b> over a 33 -month period and received thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase, urokinase or tissue-type plasminogen activator. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed in all patients. Patients with mobile or large (> 5 mm) thrombi were excluded. Functional class at initial episode was I–II in 4 patients (33. 3 %) and III–IV in 8 patients (66. 6 %). RESULTSPatients receiving thrombolytic therapy achieved an overall 83. 3 % freedom from a repeat operation or major complications (95 % confidence interval 51. 6 – 97. 9 %). Minor bleeding occurred in three patients (25 %) and allergic reaction in one (8. 3 %). Transient vague neurologic complaints, without subjective findings, occurred in four patients (33. 3 %).
