40|$|Abstract: Automatic {{identification}} technology such as RFID {{promises to}} connect physical objects with virtual representations or even computational capabilities. However, even though RFID tags are continuously falling in price, their widespread use on consumer items is still several years away, rendering large-scale experiments {{with such an}} “internet of things ” difficult. Much more ubiquitous are printed bar codes, yet so far their recognition required either specialized <b>scanner</b> <b>equipment,</b> custom-tailored bar codes or costly commercial licenses – all equally significant deployment hurdles. We have developed a freely available EAN- 13 bar code recognition and information system that is both lightweight and fast enough for the use on camera-equipped mobile phones, thus significantly lowering the barrier for large-scale, real-world testing of novel information and interaction applications based on “connected ” physical objects. We hope that this “low tech ” version of bridging the gap will allow the community to quickly develop and try out more realistic and widespread applications, and thus gain real-world experiences for better jump-starting the future internet of things, today. 1 Today’s Role of Barcode Recognitio...|$|R

The company had {{increased}} sales from 3.6 million to 10.6 million pounds and profits from 0.2 million to 1.0 million pounds in the preceding 5 years. 85% of sales went abroad, with the US and Japan its largest markets, and CEL was a world leader in press control and colour <b>scanner</b> <b>equipment.</b> Bank borrowings had increased from 0.2 million to 1.1 million pounds in the same period and, although net equity had increased fourfold to 2.1 million pounds, the company required a larger capital base to finance production to satisfy the soaring demand for its colour scanners. The Stock Market crashed, the FTSE 30 losing 73% of its value, all new issues were pulled and the company found itself in a quandary: in this period of uncertainty neither banks nor Government were willing to make a loan to CEL. To ensure its future, Crosfield sold the company to De La Rue for 6 million pounds in September 1974. This proved to be an excellent investment for De La Rue. In 1988, just the scanner business of CEL made an operating profit of 21 million pounds on sales of 210 million. De La Rue sold the colour scanning business to a joint venture of Fuji and DuPont for 235 million pounds in 1989.|$|R

40|$|The {{pipeline}} {{industry has}} conducted {{a vast amount}} of research on the subject of mechanical damage. Mechanical damage makes up {{a large portion of the}} total amount of pipeline failures that occur each year. The current methods rely on engineering judgment and experience rather than scientific theory. The method for the assessment of mechanical damage introduced in this study uses a material property called critical strain to predict the onset of cracking within the pipe wall. The critical strain is compared to the strain within a dent using a ductile failure damage indicator (DFDI). To investigate the use of the DFDI to indicate the onset of cracking within a dent, the study attempted to accomplish three tasks. The first was to investigate the use of various techniques to locate the critical strain from the stress-strain curve. Five samples taken from the pipe material was used to generate both engineering and true stress-strain curves. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to show the effects of different variables on the critical strain value. The DFDI compares the critical strain value to the calculated strain at the deepest depth location within a dent. The strain calculations use the curvature of the dent and thus require a dent profile. A high resolution laser scanner was used to extract dent profiles from a pipe. The second task of the study was to investigate the reliability of the laser <b>scanner</b> <b>equipment</b> used for this study. The results from the investigation showed that the laser scanner could be used to scan the inside of the pipe despite its design for external scanning. The results also showed that the scans should be 1 mm in length along the axis of the pipe at a resolution of 0. 5 mm and 360 degrees around the pipe. The final task was to conduct the denting test. The test used a spherical indenter to dent the pipe at increments of 3 % of the outside diameter. The results from the test showed that a visible crack did not form on the inside pipe surface as expected from the DFDI method. This does not mean a crack did not form. During the denting test distinct popping sounds were observed possibly indicating cracks forming within the pipe wall...|$|R

In this study, a surveying trolley and a remote controlled (RC) car were used to determine the bumpiness of two different surfaces. The aim with this study was to test the accuracy of a surveying trolley and an RC car to see how the accuracy can be increased with different observation methods. Total station, GPS and laser <b>scanner</b> surveying <b>equipments</b> were used, and all observations obtained by them were analysed. The laser scanner data was found to have the best precision.

When they were used with GPS, the accuracy was much lower. It was concluded that using two total stations is not increasing the accuracy, the RC car and the trolley are good measuring methods but not capable to inspect 1, 2 mm tolerance for the floors, and finally, 2 - 3 cm positioning accuracy is obtainable when using GPS...|$|R

Given the accuracy declared by the manufacturer (± 0. 7 cm/s), unsatisfactory for low flow rates, we calibrated the phantom using the gravimetric method. From the digitized images of the Pulsed Doppler spectra over time, the mean velocities have been computed with the software package developed by the authors. Moreover, to test the calibration procedure in effective conditions, we carried out performance test on five different ultrasound platforms, equipped with phased array and convex array probes with a nominal mean velocity of the blood mimicking fluid ranging from 1. 1 cm/s to 12. 7 cm/s. The pooled data showed an overestimation of the mean velocity, from over 200 % down to about 50 %, depending on nominal flow rate and ultrasound equipment. The same data, corrected via the calibration curve, showed a sensible recovery of the estimated accuracy of the tested platforms at low flow rates (< 3 cm/s) ...|$|R
