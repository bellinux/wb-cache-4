Accordingly, <b>stress</b> can occur when individual deals with the unexpected environments or threatening situations. <b>Stress</b> can become eustress (positive) or distress (negative) for someone who perceives <b>stress.</b> If the ability to deal with <b>stress</b> is not sufficient and demands are excessive, <b>stress</b> will increase continuously.
