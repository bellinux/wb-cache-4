5|$|Kristoff, meanwhile, {{expressed}} {{disappointment with}} his second-place finish and {{his failure to}} defend his 2014 title. He suggested that another rider in the final part of the race could have given a better result, as Paolini's tiredness after a long spell {{at the front of}} the race meant that Kristoff had to start his sprint too early. Michael Matthews's third-place finish was the most <b>significant</b> <b>result</b> of his career, but he too was disappointed at having fallen short, after feeling strong on the climb of the Poggio.|$|E
5|$|Cancellara's 2015 {{campaign}} started strong with {{a victory}} on Stage 2 of the Tour of Oman. He outsprinted a leading ten-man group to take the honours. In the Italian race Tirreno–Adriatico, {{he had a good}} prologue, taking second place behind Adriano Malori by a single second. He {{went on to win the}} final 10km time trial of the race. In Milan–San Remo, Cancellara was in the leading group, sprinting to seventh place. The following week, Cancellara crashed badly in E3 Harelbeke, suffering two minor fractures in the transverse processes of his lower vertebrae. His injuries prevented him from defending his Tour of Flanders title, thereby ending his spring classics campaign. He came back at the Tour des Fjords in late May without registering a <b>significant</b> <b>result.</b> On home soil at the Tour de Suisse, he was second in the opening prologue and third in the final individual time trial, both times behind new time trial star Tom Dumoulin.|$|E
5|$|With his {{improved}} ranking (No. 37), Raonic earned direct {{entry to}} Grand Slam tournaments and other ATP World Tour events {{for the first}} time. He reached the third round at both the Indian Wells Masters and the Monte-Carlo Masters. In May, Raonic rose to a new career-high ranking of No. 25. He was seeded {{for the first time}} at a Grand Slam event at the French Open, but lost in the first round to Michael Berrer. At the Halle Open, Raonic reached his first ATP World Tour doubles final, partnered with Robin Haase. The pair lost to Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi in the deciding super tiebreak. During his second round singles match at Wimbledon against Gilles Müller, Raonic retired with an early lead after injuring his right hip when he slipped and fell on the grass. He underwent hip surgery which prevented him from competing until September. His only <b>significant</b> <b>result</b> in the latter half of 2011 after returning from injury was a semifinal appearance at the Stockholm Open, where he lost to Gaël Monfils.|$|E

25|$|In 2011 the OPERA Collaboration {{published}} (in a non-peer reviewed arXiv preprint) {{the results}} of neutrino measurements, according to which neutrinos are slightly traveling faster than light. The neutrinos apparently arrived early by ~60nbsp&ns. The standard deviation was 6σ, clearly beyond the 5σ limit necessary for a <b>significant</b> <b>result.</b> However, in 2012 {{it was found that}} this result was due to measurement errors. The end result was consistent with the speed of light, see Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly.|$|E

25|$|Bayern {{started the}} 2012–13 season by {{defeating}} Borussia Dortmund 2–1 in the DFL-Supercup. It was a <b>significant</b> <b>result</b> as the Bavarians {{had lost all}} three encounters with die Schwarzgelben in the previous season, and the last five encounters between the clubs overall. Bayern's Bundesliga campaign began with a record-breaking eight consecutive wins before they suffered their only league defeat of the season at Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern quickly regained form {{and went into the}} winter break nine points clear {{at the top of the}} table.|$|E
25|$|Significance {{testing has}} been the favored {{statistical}} tool in some experimental social sciences (over 90% of articles in the Journal of Applied Psychology during the early 1990s). Other fields have favored the estimation of parameters (e.g., effect size). Significance testing {{is used as a}} substitute for the traditional comparison of predicted value and experimental result {{at the core of the}} scientific method. When theory is only capable of predicting the sign of a relationship, a directional (one-sided) hypothesis test can be configured so that only a statistically <b>significant</b> <b>result</b> supports theory. This form of theory appraisal is the most heavily criticized application of hypothesis testing.|$|E
25|$|Hypothesis testing acts as {{a filter}} of {{statistical}} conclusions; only those results meeting a probability threshold are publishable. Economics also {{acts as a}} publication filter; only those results favorable to the author and funding source may be submitted for publication. The impact of filtering on publication is termed publication bias. A related problem is that of multiple testing (sometimes linked to data mining), in which a variety of tests {{for a variety of}} possible effects are applied to a single data set and only those yielding a <b>significant</b> <b>result</b> are reported. These are often dealt with by using multiplicity correction procedures that control the family wise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR).|$|E

25|$|As such, {{the only}} {{hypothesis}} {{that needs to}} be specified in this test and which embodies the counter-claim {{is referred to as the}} null hypothesis (that is, the hypothesis to be nullified). A result is said to be statistically significant if it allows us to reject the null hypothesis. That is, as per the reductio ad absurdum reasoning, the statistically <b>significant</b> <b>result</b> should be highly improbable if the null hypothesis is assumed to be true. The rejection of the null hypothesis implies that the correct hypothesis lies in the logical complement of the null hypothesis. However, unless there is a single alternative to the null hypothesis, the rejection of null hypothesis does not tell us which of the alternatives might be the correct one.|$|E
25|$|During the Dutch East Indies (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie) era, {{the number}} of Roman Catholicism {{practitioners}} fell significantly, due to VOC policy to ban the religion. Hostility of the Dutch toward Catholicism is due to its history where the Protestant Dutch gained their independence after the Eighty Years War against Catholic Spain's rule. The most <b>significant</b> <b>result</b> was {{on the island of}} Flores and East Timor, where VOC concentrated. Moreover, Roman Catholic priests were sent to prisons or punished and replaced by Protestant clergy from the Netherlands. One Roman Catholic priest was executed for celebrating Mass in a prison during Jan Pieterszoon Coen's tenure as Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. After the VOC collapsed and with the legalisation of Catholicism in the Netherlands starting around 1800, Dutch Catholic clergy predominated until after Indonesia's independence.|$|E
25|$|This era of {{colonialism}} ended peacefully in 1948 when Ceylon gained independence from Britain. Due to the tremendous impact this caused on the city's inhabitants {{and on the}} country as a whole, the changes that resulted {{at the end of the}} colonial period were drastic. An entire new culture took root. Changes in laws and customs, clothing styles, religions and proper names were a <b>significant</b> <b>result</b> of the colonial era. These cultural changes were followed by the strengthening of the island's economy. Even today, the influence of the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British is clearly visible in Colombo's architecture, names, clothing, food, language and attitudes. Buildings from all three eras stand as reminders of the turbulent past of Colombo. The city and its people show an interesting mix of European clothing and lifestyles together with local customs.|$|E

25|$|With {{no strong}} central nuclear energy source, the {{interior}} of a brown dwarf is in a rapid boiling, or convective state. When combined with the rapid rotation that most brown dwarfs exhibit, convection sets up conditions {{for the development of a}} strong, tangled magnetic field near the surface. The flare observed by Chandra from LP 944-20 could have its origin in the turbulent magnetized hot material beneath the brown dwarf's surface. A sub-surface flare could conduct heat to the atmosphere, allowing electric currents to flow and produce an X-ray flare, like a stroke of lightning. The absence of X-rays from LP 944-20 during the non-flaring period is also a <b>significant</b> <b>result.</b> It sets the lowest observational limit on steady X-ray power produced by a brown dwarf, and shows that coronas cease to exist as the surface temperature of a brown dwarf cools below about 2800K and becomes electrically neutral.|$|E
25|$|In {{a famous}} example of {{hypothesis}} testing, {{known as the}} Lady tasting tea, Dr. Muriel Bristol, a female colleague of Fisher claimed {{to be able to}} tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the number she got correct, but just by chance. The null hypothesis was that the Lady had no such ability. The test statistic was a simple count of the number of successes in selecting the 4 cups. The critical region was the single case of 4 successes of 4 possible based on a conventional probability criterion (<nbsp&5%; 1 of 70 ≈nbsp&1.4%). Fisher asserted that no alternative hypothesis was (ever) required. The lady correctly identified every cup, which would be considered a statistically <b>significant</b> <b>result.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} {{race of the}} 1997 Formula One season, David Coulthard {{produced}} victory for McLaren and ushered {{in a new era}} of success for the British based squad. Coincidentally this was the first race in which McLaren had competed with a silver livery due to West replacing Marlboro, who moved to Ferrari, as title sponsor. The colour drew inevitable comparisons to the Silver Arrows of a previous era, and the nickname was applied to the McLarens. This was a <b>significant</b> <b>result</b> in F1 racing, McLaren's first victory for three seasons and the first win for Mercedes-Benz since Juan Manuel Fangio's success at the 1955 Italian Grand Prix. McLaren and Mercedes-Benz still, however, finished fourth in the Constructors' Championship behind the same three teams as the previous two seasons, but they had collected {{more than twice as many}} points in '97 as they had in '95.|$|E
