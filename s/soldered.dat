5|$|Probably {{the easiest}} to recycle would be bismuth-containing fusible alloys {{in the form of}} larger objects, then larger <b>soldered</b> objects. Half of the world's solder {{consumption}} is in electronics (i.e., circuit boards). As the <b>soldered</b> objects get smaller or contain little solder or little bismuth, the recovery gets progressively more difficult and less economic, although solder with a higher silver content will be more worthwhile recovering. Next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair bismuth content, perhaps as bismuth phosphomolybdate, and then bismuth used in galvanizing and as a free-machining metallurgical additive.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{were often}} first sketched by Oliver, before {{she moved to}} {{construction}} in three dimensions. When preparing commissions, she would draw on the ideas of clients or {{the nature of the}} site. For large works she created maquettes (or models), sometimes in plasticine, on other occasions using copper wire or, in the case of her 2002 sculpture Globe, wood and metal. Oliver would produce the more delicate works herself. Many were created by crafting and joining wire to create abstract forms. These were built around moulds, twisting the metal into place with pliers, before severing it with wirecutters. Joins were <b>soldered</b> or brazed (though in some pieces, the wire was woven). In Web (2002), copper pieces were sewn together using wire.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{has many}} semiconductor-related applications. Some indium compounds, such as indium {{antimonide}} and indium phosphide, are semiconductors with useful properties: one precursor is usually trimethylindium (TMI), {{which is also}} used as the semiconductor dopant in II–VI compound semiconductors. InAs and InSb are used for low-temperature transistors and InP for high-temperature transistors. The compound semiconductors InGaN and InGaP are used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes. Indium is used in photovoltaics as the semiconductor copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), also called CIGS solar cells, a type of second-generation thin-film solar cell. Indium is used in PNP bipolar junction transistors with germanium: when <b>soldered</b> at low temperature, indium does not stress the germanium.|$|E
40|$|DE 10252577 A UPAB: 20040702 NOVELTY - Connecting a first <b>solder</b> partner (20) to {{a second}} <b>solder</b> partner (10) {{comprises}} placing the first <b>solder</b> partner, the second <b>solder</b> partner and a <b>solder</b> depot (30) so that one surface (20 a) of the first <b>solder</b> partner lies opposite one surface (10 a) of the second <b>solder</b> partner, and heating the <b>solder</b> partners so that the <b>solder</b> depot melts and is pulled by capillary forces into a joining region to join the <b>solder</b> partners through a joining layer.

ADVANTAGE - A reliable joint is formed between two <b>solder</b> partners...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of powder size in <b>solder</b> paste on the <b>solder</b> volume applied by paste printing has been examined. The applied <b>solder</b> volume {{increased with decreasing}} the average diameter of <b>solder</b> powder which are contained in the <b>solder</b> paste. The <b>solder</b> paste with fine <b>solder</b> powder easily caused a <b>solder</b> bridging failure between the electrodes for a fine pitch QFP after reflow <b>soldering.</b> The measurement value of the applied <b>solder</b> volume was good accordance with the approximate half of the calculated volume using the close-packed model in which the powder with the average diameter is close-packed in the opening space of the stencil...|$|R
25|$|A preform is a pre-made {{shape of}} <b>solder</b> {{specially}} {{designed for the}} application where {{it is to be}} used. Many methods are used to manufacture the <b>solder</b> preform, stamping being the most common. The <b>solder</b> preform may include the <b>solder</b> flux needed for the <b>soldering</b> process. This can be an internal flux, inside the <b>solder</b> preform, or external, with the <b>solder</b> preform coated.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} design {{was a simple}} solid plug filled with a slug of low-melting-point alloy. When this melts, it first melts as a narrow channel through the plug. Steam and water immediately begins to escape through this. The cored fusible plug {{was developed in the}} 1860s to give a wide opening as soon as the alloy softens. This version has a solid brass or bronze centre, <b>soldered</b> into place by a layer of the low-melting-point alloy. When overheated, the plug does not release any steam or water until the alloy melts sufficiently to release the centre plug. The plug now fails dramatically, opening its entire bore immediately. This full-bore jet is then more likely to be noticed.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by Owen Beattie, a professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta, began a series of scientific studies of the graves, bodies, and other physical evidence left by Franklin's men on Beechey Island and King William Island. They concluded that the men buried on Beechey Island most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, and that lead poisoning may have worsened their health, owing to badly <b>soldered</b> cans held in the ships' food stores. However, it was later suggested that the source of this lead may not have been tinned food, but the distilled water systems fitted to the ships. Cut marks on human bones found on King William Island were seen as signs of cannibalism. The combined evidence of all studies suggested that the crewmen did not all die quickly. Hypothermia, starvation, lead poisoning and diseases including scurvy, along with general exposure to a hostile environment whilst lacking adequate clothing and nutrition, killed everyone on the expedition in the years following its last sighting by Europeans in 1845.|$|E
5|$|Murrell used witch bottles {{as part of}} his magical practices, and, {{during the}} 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple {{encountered}} claims that Murrell was able to summon anyone he wished using them, including individuals who had gone overseas. Murrell experimented {{with the use of a}} witch bottle constructed out of iron; he had two such devices created by a local smith, Stephen Choppen, and had the plug at the mouth <b>soldered</b> up before the bottle was placed in a fire as part of an anti-bewitchment spell. The idea behind this was that the bottle itself would not explode under the heat, and that thus it could be reused on other occasions. According to folklore collected by Maple, the smith's attempts, which were initially unsuccessful, succeeded only after Murrell had recited a charm.|$|E
50|$|To simplify <b>soldering,</b> beginners {{are usually}} advised {{to apply the}} <b>soldering</b> iron and the <b>solder</b> {{separately}} to the joint, rather than the <b>solder</b> being applied direcly to the iron. When sufficient <b>solder</b> is applied, the <b>solder</b> wire is removed. When the surfaces are adequately heated, the <b>solder</b> will flow around the workpieces. The iron is then removed from the joint.|$|R
50|$|The {{required}} accuracy in alignment {{can also be}} achieved by controlling the flow of <b>solder</b> on the PWB during reflow <b>soldering.</b> For this purpose, {{the space between the}} pads is often coated with a <b>solder</b> mask. The <b>solder</b> mask materials have no affinity to the molten <b>solder</b> and hence, no positive bonding is formed between them as the <b>solder</b> solidifies. This process {{is often referred to as}} <b>Solder</b> Masking. The mask must be centered correctly. The mask protects the PWB against oxidation, and prevents unintended <b>solder</b> bridges from forming between closely spaced <b>solder</b> pads.|$|R
40|$|Voiding in <b>solder</b> joints poses {{a serious}} {{reliability}} concern for electronic products. The {{aim of this}} research was to quantify the void formation in lead-free <b>solder</b> joints through X-ray inspections. Experiments were designed to investigate how void formation is affected by <b>solder</b> bump size and shape, differences in reflow time and temperature, and differences in <b>solder</b> paste formulation. Four different lead-free <b>solder</b> paste samples were used to produce <b>solder</b> bumps on a number of test boards, using surface mount reflow <b>soldering</b> process. Using an advanced X-ray inspection system void percentages were measured for three different size and shape <b>solder</b> bumps. Results indicate that the voiding in <b>solder</b> joint is strongly influenced by <b>solder</b> bump size and shape, with voids found to have increased when bump size decreased. A longer soaking period during reflow stage has negatively affected <b>solder</b> voids. Voiding was also accelerated with smaller <b>solder</b> particles in <b>solder</b> paste...|$|R
25|$|<b>Soldered</b> tone holes: Tone-holes may {{be either}} drawn (by pulling the tube {{material}} outwards) or <b>soldered</b> (cutting {{a hole in}} the tube and soldering an extra ring of material on). <b>Soldered</b> tone-holes are thought by some to improve tone, but generally cost more.|$|E
25|$|CuproBraze is an {{alternative}} to <b>soldered</b> copper/brass plate fin, <b>soldered</b> copper brass serpentine fin, and brazed aluminium serpentine fin. The technology enables brazed copper serpentine fins {{to be used in}} copper-brass heat exchanger designs. These are less expensive to manufacture than <b>soldered</b> serpentine fin designs. They are also stronger, lighter, more durable, and have tougher joints.|$|E
25|$|The griffin-headed bracelets {{were also}} the most complex objects to manufacture, being cast in several elements, then worked in many {{different}} techniques, and <b>soldered</b> together. Some of the surfaces are very thin, and show signs of damage, and in one place repair with a <b>soldered</b> patch.|$|E
50|$|Modern circuit {{assembly}} {{techniques that}} use reflow <b>soldering</b> {{do not necessarily}} allow the <b>solder</b> to flow more than once. They guarantee that the granulated <b>solder</b> contained in the <b>solder</b> paste surpasses the reflow temperature of the <b>solder</b> involved.|$|R
50|$|Ultrasonic <b>soldering</b> uses either {{ultrasonically}} coupled heated <b>solder</b> iron tips (0.5 - 10 mm) or ultrasonically coupled <b>solder</b> baths {{as mentioned}} above. In these devices, piezoelectric crystals {{are used to}} generate high frequency (20 - 60 kHz) acoustic waves in molten <b>solder</b> layers or batch, to mechanically disrupt oxides that form on the molten <b>solder</b> surfaces. The tips for U/S <b>soldering</b> irons are also coupled to a heating element while the piezoelectric crystal is thermally isolated, not to degrade the piezoelectric element. Ultrasonic <b>soldering</b> iron tips can heat (up to 450 °C) while mechanically oscillating at 20 - 60 kHz. This <b>soldering</b> tip can melt <b>solder</b> filler metals as acoustic vibrations are induced in the molten <b>solder</b> pool. The vibration and cavitation in the molten <b>solder</b> then permits <b>solders</b> to wet and adhere to many metal surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|Each <b>solder</b> alloy has {{characteristics}} that {{work best for}} certain applications, notably strength and conductivity, and each type of <b>solder</b> and alloy has different melting temperatures. The term silver <b>solder</b> denotes the type of <b>solder</b> that is used. Some soft <b>solders</b> are [...] "silver-bearing" [...] alloys used to <b>solder</b> silver-plated items. Lead-based <b>solders</b> {{should not be used}} on precious metals because the lead dissolves the metal and disfigures it.|$|R
25|$|Another {{advantage}} of copper roofing systems {{is that they}} are relatively easy to repair. For small pits or cracks, affected areas can be cleaned and filled with solder. For larger areas, patches can be cut and <b>soldered</b> into place. For major areas, the affected copper can be cut out and replaced using a flat locked <b>soldered</b> seam.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} {{intermetallic compounds}} are formed during solidifying of solders and during their reactions with the <b>soldered</b> surfaces.|$|E

Responding to increasing environmental and health concerns over lead toxicity, Lead-Free <b>Soldering</b> in Electronics discusses <b>soldering</b> inspection and design, mechanical evaluation in electronics, lead-free <b>solder</b> paste and reflow <b>soldering,</b> plating lead-free <b>soldering</b> in electronics, and wave <b>soldering...</b>|$|R
40|$|Low-cycle {{isothermal}} mechanical {{fatigue testing}} of bulk <b>solders</b> and <b>solder</b> joints of eutectic Sn- 37 wt%Pb, Sn- 3. 5 wt%Ag, and Sn- 4. 0 wt%Ag- 0. 5 wt%Cu {{were carried out}} at room temperature {{over a wide range}} of strains (1 % 10 %). The fatigue results of both bulk and <b>solder</b> joints were compared and the eutectic Sn- 37 wt%Pb was used for reference. Concerning bulk <b>solders</b> and <b>solder</b> joints, the two lead-free <b>solders</b> displayed better fatigue properties than Sn- 37 Pb. For all three <b>solder</b> alloys tested, bulk <b>solders</b> showed better fatigue performance than <b>solder</b> joints when subjected to higher strains. The situation was the opposite at lower strains, resulting in bulk <b>solders</b> depicting larger values for the Coffin-Manson fatigue exponent and ductility coefficient compared to <b>solder</b> joints...|$|R

40|$|SnAgCu {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} candidates for lead-free <b>solders</b> to replace conventional eutectic SnPb <b>solders.</b> The effects of <b>solder</b> volume on interfacial reactions and microstructure evolution in Au/Ni-SnAgCu-Ni(P) <b>solder</b> joints have been investigated under <b>soldering</b> and thermal aging conditions. The results show that <b>solder</b> volume has a strong effect on the formation of Au-containing intermetallic compounds (IMCs) and their redeposition at the interfaces. The size and volume fraction of Au-containing IMCs dispersed in the <b>solder</b> bulk increased with decreasing the <b>solder</b> joint dimensions. For the small <b>solder</b> joint with 300 µm <b>solder</b> ball, the (Au,Ni) Sn 4 IMCs redeposited to the interfaces after thermal aging at 150 ℃ for 9 days, but this was not observed for the other two <b>solder</b> joints with large <b>solder</b> volume.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to gather and review all the {{important}} properties of the Sn–Ag–Cu (SAC) <b>solder</b> alloy. The SAC <b>solder</b> alloy has been proposed as the alternative <b>solder</b> to overcome the environmental concern of lead (Pb) <b>solder.</b> Many researchers have studied the SAC <b>solder</b> alloy and found that the properties such as melting temperature, wettability, microstructure and interfacial, together with mechanical properties, are better for the SAC <b>solder</b> than the tin – lead (SnPb) <b>solders.</b> Meanwhile, addition of various elements and nanoparticles seems to produce enhancement on the prior bulk <b>solder</b> alloy as well. These benefits suggest that the SAC <b>solder</b> alloy could be the next alternative <b>solder</b> for the electronic packaging industry. Although many studies have been conducted for this particular <b>solder</b> alloy, a compilation of all these properties regarding the SAC <b>solder</b> alloy is still not available for a review to say...|$|R

5|$|The {{life-cycle}} {{assessment of}} bismuth {{will focus on}} <b>solders,</b> {{one of the major}} uses of bismuth, and the one with the most complete information. The average primary energy use for <b>solders</b> is around 200 MJ per kg, with the high-bismuth <b>solder</b> (58% Bi) only 20% of that value, and three low-bismuth <b>solders</b> (2% to 5% Bi) running very close to the average. The global warming potential averaged 10 to 14kg carbon dioxide, with the high-bismuth <b>solder</b> about two-thirds of that and the low-bismuth <b>solders</b> about average. The acidification potential for the <b>solders</b> is around 0.9 to 1.1kg sulfur dioxide equivalent, with the high-bismuth <b>solder</b> and one low-bismuth <b>solder</b> only one-tenth of the average and the other low-bismuth <b>solders</b> about average.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{lead-free}} <b>solders</b> requires new fundamental {{information for}} flow <b>soldering.</b> Parameters, approved {{for many years}} with the <b>solder</b> SnPb, for wave height, flow speed and also the tear-off angle must be defined again for lead-free <b>solders.</b> In addition, the corrosion of substrate metallization and especially of machines (crucible and other parts in liquid <b>solder)</b> is under discussion for lead-free <b>soldering</b> today.

All assessed lead-free materials, besides the Ni/Au PCB finish, considerably reduce the toxic releases from PCBs into the environment. Lead-free <b>soldering</b> with SnAgCu and SnCu <b>solders</b> and current equipment increases the {{energy consumption}} in reflow <b>soldering.</b> To a minor degree it also enhances the energy demand for metal production. The energy consumption of the reflow oven is an environmental hot spot in the life cycle. The situation will improve with already available new oven technology. Evaluation with the Eco Indicator 95 and the Eco Point method show, that lead-free <b>soldering</b> with current <b>soldering</b> equipment and with the assessed lead-free <b>solders</b> and the tin PCB finish considerably reduces the overall burden to the environment.
