40|$|We uncover {{anisotropic}} permeability in microfluidic deterministic {{lateral displacement}} (DLD) arrays. A DLD array can achieve high-resolution bimodal size-based separation of microparticles, including bioparticles, such as cells. For an application with a given <b>separation</b> <b>size,</b> correct device operation {{requires that the}} flow remains at a fixed angle to the obstacle array. We demonstrate via experiments and lattice-Boltzmann simulations that subtle array design features cause anisotropic permeability. Anisotropic permeability indicates the microfluidic array's intrinsic tendency to induce an undesired lateral pressure gradient. This can cause an inclined flow and therefore local changes in the critical <b>separation</b> <b>size.</b> Thus, particle trajectories can become unpredictable and the device useless for the desired separation task. Anisotropy becomes severe for arrays with unequal axial and lateral gaps between obstacle posts and highly asymmetric post shapes. Furthermore, of the two equivalent array layouts employed with the DLD, the rotated-square layout does not display intrinsic anisotropy. We therefore recommend this layout over the easier-to-implement parallelogram layout. We provide additional guidelines for avoiding adverse effects of anisotropy on the DLD.

40|$|In the {{hypersonic}} regime scramjet engines offer a {{great potential}} for future propulsion systems of space transportation applications. The intake of a scramjet engine compresses the incoming air for an efficient combustion cycle while aiming to produce minimum drag and heat load. One feature of the scramjet intake’s flow field is the shock wave/boundary layer interaction (SWBLI) which causes high peak heat loads and affects the direction {{as well as the}} load of the aerodynamic force. The interaction occurs e. g. at compression corners and locations of shock wave impingement on boundary layers. The corresponding shock wave is generated due to flow deflection e. g. at the intake cowl. As space launcher propulsion device, the scramjet accelerates the launcher and with it increases its velocity and flight altitude. This affects the flow similarity parameters like Reynolds number, Mach number and total temperature all affecting the SWBLI so that the interaction changes during flight. The current understanding of SWBLIs allows the prediction of the aerodynamics and the heat load of a scramjet intake flow field with occurring SWBLI, if the size of the interaction is known. Since this size could so far not be estimated and varies during flight of a space launcher, the aim {{of this study was to}} provide a correlation for the <b>separation</b> <b>size</b> and to describe the variation of this size for the different flow similarity parameters. The approach of this study employed experimental testing as well as numerical simulations whereby the latter utilized the performed experiments during this study as well as experiments conducted by other investigators. Through such additional test cases, the number of covered similarity parameters could be increased so that the experiments and numerical simulations provided a good validation data base for the developed analytically based model of the SWBLI size. The hypersonic shock tunnel TH 2 produced the desired hypersonic free stream conditions at different total temperatures to test the employed models which were a double ramp configuration and a scramjet intake. Both permitted the investigation of different leading edge radii and of different wall temperatures which were provided by the installed electric heating. The double ramp configuration was a redesign of a previous model and addressed two-dimensional SWBLIs in the midspan of the model. To study three-dimensional effects on the SWBLIs and their influence on the scramjet intake’s flow field, at first the scramjet intake model had to be developed. This development included the improvement of the model heating technique which allowed wall pressure measurements during experiments with wall temperatures up to 1000 K. Regarding the model heating technique, two constraints had to be considered. First, for wall pressure measurements the employed transducers had to be placed as close as possible to the heated model surface. This placement ensured short transducer response times which were required because in the short measurement times of the shock tunnel. Second, because the transducers could not sustain the high experimental wall temperatures, the transducers had to be cooled. This cooling being concurrent with the wall heating restricted the maximum achievable wall temperature due to the short distance between the heated wall and the cooled transducers. Concluding, the maximum wall temperature was increased from 760 K for the double ramp experiments to 1000 K for the scramjet intake experiments. This was achieved due to increased heating power and an enhanced thermal insulation. The enhanced thermal insulation was the outcome of the developed sandwich construction resulting in maximum temperature gradients of 875 K/cm within the model. To observe the effect of the different flow similarity parameters on the flow field and with it on the aerodynamics and the heat load, different measurement techniques were employed: • wall pressure measurements,• heat flux measurements,• black-and-white schlieren images,• colour schlieren images and• infrared images. The potential of the black-and-white schlieren image technique for quantitative measurements was investigated and demonstrated its {{great potential for}} planar flows. The gained understanding permitted a more detailed interpretation of the schlieren image and thereby of the flow field. Moreover, this knowledge was used to increase the image quality by adaption of the optical setup and the digital display range thus making the invisible visible. The numerical simulations were conducted with the commercial code CFX which was validated for hypersonic flows by comparisons with analytical solutions and empirical correlations for various hypersonic flow phenomena. For this validation and the investigated SWBLI, grid convergence studies were performed to ensure grid independency. The SWBLI simulations were conducted with laminar, transitional and turbulent shear layer behaviour so that the experimental and numerical data set covered following influences on the SWBLI:• Reynolds number,• Mach number,• total temperature,• boundary layer state (laminar, transitional, turbulent),• wall temperature,• leading edge bluntness,• side flow and,• side wall installation. To describe the extent of the SWBLI, an analytically based model of the SWBLI was developed based on the momentum equation and employing several simplifications. The model explains the effects of the different flow similarity parameters on the SWBLI and was compared to the numerical simulations increasing the model’s accuracy. The pressure rise which is necessary to cause incipient separation, was considered in the model. This incipient separation pressure rise had already been correlated by different authors giving deviating results for a wide Mach number range and other flow similarity parameters so that a new correlation was developed. This correlation is the same as for the SWBLI model based on physical reasoning thus allows a more detailed understanding of the incipient separation process. The conducted experiments with the double ramp model and the employed experiments of other researchers addressed SWBLIs which were deemed to be two-dimensional in the midspan of the wind tunnel models. For laminar SWBLIs the increase of <b>separation</b> <b>size</b> with increasing Reynolds number, decreasing Mach number and decreasing total temperature were proven with the analytically based model. The influence of the shear layer state on the SWBLI is to decrease the <b>separation</b> <b>size</b> from laminar to turbulent shear layer behaviour whereby transitional interactions represent the separation sizes between the limiting laminar and turbulent cases. If the transition is completed more rapidly, the <b>separation</b> <b>size</b> is decreased due to the increased shear forces within a turbulent shear layer. Besides this effect on the <b>separation</b> <b>size,</b> the effects of elevated wall temperature increasing the <b>separation</b> <b>size</b> on the one hand and of increased leading edge radius on the other hand were investigated with the double ramp model. An increased leading edge radius enlarges the <b>separation</b> <b>size</b> for small leading edge radii and decreases the <b>separation</b> <b>size</b> for leading edge radii being larger than a critical radius. It was observed that this reversal trend of the <b>separation</b> <b>size</b> for increasing leading edge radius is the result of the entropy layer swallowing phenomenon. Since leading edge bluntness provokes the entropy layer, it also defines the position of entropy layer swallowing in downstream direction. Due to the fact that entropy layer swallowing at the separation of SWBLI causes the largest SWBLI, the corresponding leading edge radius is the critical one. All mentioned influences on the SWBLI were analysed based on physical reasoning with the developed analytically based model. The prediction of the separation length with the analytically based model showed good agreement with the experimental and numerical results whereby some limitations remain. The experiments conducted with the scramjet intake model focused mainly on the SWBLI at the kink of the compression ramps including three-dimensional effects. The flow field with omitted side walls showed clearly the effect of side flow leading to a smaller separation length of the SWBLI compared to the numerical simulation of the two-dimensional flow field. The observations concerning the side wall installation indicated a complex three-dimensional flow field with the separation and the reattachment line having a tongue shape compared to the almost straight line in the two-dimensional case. The corner flow between the side walls and the compression ramp geometry increased the heat load of the first ramp locally, but the heat load in the midspan part of the first compression ramp was decreased due to the prevented side flow. For the experiments with installed side walls the pressure level of the second ramp was increased significantly compared to the inviscid two-dimensional solution. This was due to the prevented spillage flow and the additional compression due to the corner flow and the boundary layers on the side walls. The SWBLI size for omitted and installed side walls increased for increasing wall temperature and for decreasing total temperature. The obtained results indicate clearly the importance to reproduce all flow similarity parameters of a scramjet intake flow field being Mach number, Reynolds number, total temperature, wall temperature and the boundary layer state. For future designs the decision to employ side walls for the outer compression will be a compromise between the spilled mass flow reducing the maximum thrust as well as the increased drag and heat load due to side wall installation. The side wall installation provokes additional shock waves and side wall boundary layers which causes drag and heat load increase. The investigation of the intake shoulder flow with omitted cowl by schlieren optical and numerical means indicated that the expansion at the shoulder reduced the turbulence significantly, which was generated by the SWBLI at the compression kink. Further downstream of the intake’s shoulder, boundary layer transition took place as observed by the schlieren images, thereby indicating a very fragile state of this new boundary layer developing from the shoulder. Since the boundary layer state has a large influence on the extent of the SWBLI, this observation represents a useful baseline information for the investigation of the interaction between this boundary layer and the impinging cowl shock. To round off this thesis with respect to the research training group supporting this research, the gained understanding of scramjet intake flows has been included in a new concept engine. Due to the stacking of several engine modules next to each other only the outer modules are affected by side flow, whereby the investigated scramjet intake represents the width of one module. To prevent this side flow, which reduces the captured mass flow and with it the thrust of the engine, the compression ramps’ width increases in upstream direction. This design feature avoids additional heat loads caused by corner flow and drag due to side wall installation so that such concept engine with enhancements of other engine parts has been determined to produce net thrust...|$|E
40|$|A more {{efficient}} classifying cyclone (CC) for fine particle classification {{has been developed}} in recent years at the JKMRC. The novel CC, known as the JKCC, has modified profiles of the cyclone body, vortex finder, and spigot when compared to conventional hydrocyclones. The novel design increases the centrifugal force inside the cyclone and mitigates the short circuiting flow that exists in all current cyclones. It also decreases the probability of particle contamination in the place near the cyclone spigot. Consequently the cyclone efficiency is improved while the unit maintains a simple structure. An international patent has been granted for this novel cyclone design. In the first development stage - a feasibility study - a 100 mm JKCC was tested and compared with two 100 mm commercial units. Very encouraging results were achieved, indicating good potential for the novel design. In the second development stage - a scale-up stage - the JKCC was scaled up to 200 mm in diameter, and its geometry was optimized through numerous tests. The performance of the JKCC was compared with a 150 mm commercial unit and exhibited sharper separation, finer <b>separation</b> <b>size,</b> and lower flow ratios. The JKCC is now being scaled up into a full-size (480 mm) hydrocyclone in the third development stage - an industrial study. The 480 mm diameter unit will be tested in an Australian coal preparation plant, and directly compared with a commercial CC operating under the same conditions. Classifying cyclone performance for fine coal could be further improved if the unit is installed in an inclined position. The study using the 200 mm JKCC has revealed that sharpness of separation improved and the flow ratio to underflow was decreased by 43 % as the cyclone inclination was varied from the vertical position (0 °) to the horizontal position (90 °). The <b>separation</b> <b>size</b> was not affected, although the feed rate was slightly decreased. To ensure self-emptying upon shutdown, {{it is recommended that}} the JKCC be installed at an inclination of 75 - 80 °.

This may be of benefit to operations that require improved performance from their classifying cyclones in terms of sharpness of separation and flow ratio, while tolerating slightly reduced feed rate.

Branch flow filtration is particularly promising because it has an unlimited dynamic range (ratio of largest passable particle to the smallest separated particle) but suffers from very poor volume throughput because when many branches are used, they cannot be identical if each is to have the same size cut-off. We describe a new iterative approach to the design of branch filtration devices able to overcome this limitation without large dead volumes. This is demonstrated by numerical modelling, fabrication and testing of devices with 20 branches, with dynamic ranges up to 6. 9, and high filtration ratios (14 - 29 %) on beads and fungal spores. The filters have a sharp size cutoff (10 x depletion for 12 % size difference), with large particle rejection equivalent to a 20 th order Butterworth low pass filter.

The wind tunnel tests are compared to the numerical results, which are obtained by using the CFD code TRACE.

The investigated hub extensions lead to a reduction of the separation zones downstream of the hubs end. This results in a better diffuser performance in terms of pressure recovery and pressure loss of all extensions compared to the baseline. As expected, the ellipsoidal extension gives the highest pressure recovery for an infinite Carnot diffuser length. At the given length of the Carnot in this case, the Hollow Cylinder lead to the best compromise for all performance parameters.

40|$|Oblique Shock-Wave Reflections or Shock Wave-Boundary Layer {{interactions}} (SWBLI) {{are complex}} phenomena which commonly occur in high speed flight. SWBLIs can have catastrophic consequences on the aircraft due to shock induced separation and unsteadiness of the interaction. These adverse {{effects can be}} mitigated by manipulating the boundary layer, either before it enters the interaction, or in the interaction region itself. Micro-ramp vortex generators or micro-ramps {{have been identified as}} promising boundary layer control methods in supersonic engine intakes. They are small ramp devices with heights less than the boundary layer thickness (typically 50 % of boundary layer thickness). It is known that, micro-ramps generate a counter-rotating vortex pair, due to which a fuller and more separation resistant boundary layer is obtained upstream of the SWBLI. They successfully prevent separation at their centrelines and their effectiveness reduces away from their centrelines. Since a micro-ramp generates a highly 3 D flow, the main aim {{of this study is to}} quantify the 3 D velocity fields in the micro-ramp controlled interaction. Further, this study is motivated by the fundamental question whether the total volume of separated flow in the interaction is reduced by employing micro-ramp control. The results from tomographic-PIV experiments confirm that micro-ramp control has a beneficial effect on SWBLI in reducing separation. For the experimental conditions and micro-ramp geometry used in this thesis, the total volume of separated flow is reduced to 31 % compared to the interaction without control. Further, the maximum separation probability is also reduced by using micro-ramp control, with the largest reductions occurring along the micro-ramp centreline. Additionally, the findings indicate that a moderately negative correlation coefficient exists between <b>separation</b> bubble <b>sizes</b> at spanwise stations on either side of the micro-ramp centreline. This indicates that the <b>separation</b> bubble <b>size</b> at a particular spanwise location is coupled to its size at another spanwise location in the micro-ramp controlled interaction. Along with the 3 D velocity fields in the interaction, these results extend the knowledge on micro-ramp control significantly. It is conjectured that the spanwise correlation between the <b>separation</b> bubble <b>sizes</b> may play an important role while using micro-ramp arrays for applications in supersonic engine intakes. Therefore, an immediate possible investigation would involve studies of 3 D effects of micro-ramp array control and the spanwise correlation of the <b>separation</b> bubble <b>sizes.</b> Aerospace EngineeringAerodynamics and Wind Energ...|$|R
40|$|In early 2006, the Cluster {{spacecraft}} {{crossed the}} dayside magnetopause twice each orbit with the spacecraft at their largest {{separation of the}} entire mission (~ 10 000 km). In this paper, we present in situ observations at this <b>separation</b> <b>size</b> of flux transfer events (FTEs), which are a signature of transient or time-varying magnetopause reconnection. We study a magnetopause crossing on 27 January 2006; for half an hour, the tetrahedron of Cluster spacecraft straddled the magnetopause and during this time {{a large number of}} flux transfer events were observed. Three particular FTEs were observed by all four spacecraft, enabling it to be shown that individual FTEs at the magnetopause can extend azimuthally for at least 10 000 km. By combining the Cluster tetrahedron geometry with the observed velocity of the FTEs, it can be shown that the poleward extent of one FTE is significantly smaller than its azimuthal extent. The location of the Cluster spacecraft when they observed this FTE suggests that it is inconsistent with the simple interpretation of an "elbow-shaped" flux tube. The FTE's azimuthal extent suggests that it was more likely generated at a comparatively long reconnection line or lines, although the magnetic shear across the magnetopause is not high enough to exclude the "elbow-shaped" model entirely.

40|$|Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes {{computations}} of a shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction (SWBLI) {{created by}} a Mach 2. 85 flow over an axisymmetric 30 -degree compression corner were carried out. The objectives were to evaluate four turbulence models commonly used in industry, for SWBLIs, and to evaluate the suitability of this test case for use in further turbulence model benchmarking. The Spalart-Allmaras model, Menter's Baseline and Shear Stress Transport models, and a low-Reynolds number k- model were evaluated. Results indicate that the models do not accurately predict the separation location; with the SST model predicting the separation onset too early and the other models predicting the onset too late. Overall the Spalart-Allmaras model did {{the best job in}} matching the experimental data. However there is significant room for improvement, most notably in the prediction of the turbulent shear stress. Density data showed that the simulations did not accurately predict the thermal boundary layer upstream of the SWBLI. The effect of turbulent Prandtl number and wall temperature were studied in an attempt to improve this prediction and understand their effects on the interaction. The data showed that both parameters can significantly affect the <b>separation</b> <b>size</b> and location, but did not improve the agreement with the experiment. This case proved challenging to compute and should provide a good test for future turbulence modeling work...|$|E
40|$|A new cytological tool, {{based on}} the micro Coulter {{particle}} counter (CPC) principle, aimed at diagnostic applications for cell counting and separation in haematology, oncology or toxicology is described. The device measures the spectral impedance of individual cells or particles and allows screening rates over 100 samples s(- 1) on a single-cell basis. This analyzer is intended to drive a sorting actuator producing a subsequent cell <b>separation.</b> <b>Size</b> reduction and integration of functions are essential in achieving precise measurements and high throughput. 3 D finite element simulations are presented to compare various electrode geometries and their influence on cell parameters estimation. The device {{is based on a}} glass-polyimide microfluidic chip with integrated channels and electrodes microfabricated at the length scale of the particles to be investigated (1 - 20 mum). A laminar liquid flow carries the suspended particles through the measurement area. Each particle's impedance signal is recorded by a differential pair of microelectrodes using the cell surrounding media as a reference. The micromachined chip and processing electronic circuit allow simultaneous impedance measurements at multiple frequencies, ranging from 100 kHz to 15 MHz. In this paper, we describe the microfabrication and characterisation of an on-chip flow-cytometer as the first building block of a complete cell- sorting device. We then discuss the signal conditioning technique and finally impedance measurements of cells and particles of different sizes and types to demonstrate the differentiation of subpopulations in a mixed sample...|$|E
