Fortschrittberichte : Reihe 12; Nr. 606. - ISBN 3 - 18 - 360612 - 7 The use of <b>scaled</b> <b>vehicles</b> can take advantages regarding risk and cost minimization within the experimental verification of vehicle dynamics development projects. Hence this work presents a development methodology including <b>scaled</b> <b>vehicles</b> and a fully functional <b>scaled</b> <b>vehicle</b> itself. To demonstrate the usage of <b>scaled</b> <b>vehicles</b> a flexible path planning method for future vehicle guidance systems is developed, whereas the vehicle path behaves like an elastic band which avoids obstacles while ensuring a smooth vehicle path. To ensure vehicle safety under vehicle dynamic aspects during the planed manoeuvre a path-oriented procedure to a priori predict vehicle dynamic states is presented. Verification of the path planning method is done by conducting several test drives with the <b>scaled</b> <b>vehicle...</b>|$|R

With the use of telematics we can make use of wide range of smart inter-vehicle communication applications like emergency message transmission, collision avoidance, congestion monitoring and intelligent parking space locator. In this paper we present certain requirements for adaptive context-aware information mediation in large <b>scale</b> <b>vehicle</b> networks.

40|$|INTRODUCTION As the use {{of control}} systems in {{vehicles}} has increased the past several yem-s. !the safety', per/'ormance, and reliability of vehicles has improved, primarily duc {{to the implementation of}} automated controllers. A significant amount of research has been done on vehicle control (Tomixuka and Hedrick, 1995, Shlado,/er, 1995), but much of this work has been limited to simulation because {{the use of}} a lull sze vehicle to test controllers is often prohibitively expcnsiw' as well as dangerous.

40|$|An {{approach}} {{for developing a}} tire suitable for performing small <b>scale</b> <b>vehicle</b> dynamics research is discussed. This will allow for physical verification of vehicle dynamics modelling and controls in environments where a full scale prototype is either not feasible or too large an investment. Currently, <b>scale</b> <b>vehicle</b> research {{is limited by the}} availability of tires on the desired scale, which are typically sourced from the radio controlled (RC) vehicle industry. Use of these tires, however, results in poor similitude between the representative <b>scale</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the full <b>scale</b> <b>vehicle.</b> This is due to variations in the behaviour of the scale tire to the full scale tire. An existing analytical tire model known as the cornering force self-aligning torque model (CF/SAT), is analyzed and modifications to the model are proposed to allow it to be used for non-dimensional tire parameterization. The model is then non-dimensionalized, using Buckingham Pi theory, to allow for comparison of small scale tire performance to large scale tire performance. A static load-deflection tire testing apparatus named the Windsor Automotive Tire Tester (WATT) is also developed. This machine is used to analyze if it is possible to determine the CF/SAT parameters for a given tire without the use of full scale tire dynamic studies and regression analysis. A DUBRO 5. 00 T. V. RC airplane tire is then parameterized and modelled using relationships derived from the static tire data. The results of the tire model are compared with experimental data of the DUBRO 5. 00 T. V. tire in order to analyze the effectiveness of the approach. It was found {{that it was possible to}} estimate some tire parameters using this method, however, more research is required to fully parameterize the tire using static load-deflection data...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{situations}} where physical testing {{of a vehicle}} or vehicle controller is necessary, yet use of a full-size vehicle is not practical. Some situations include implementation testing of novel actuation strategies, analyzing the behavior of chassis feedback control under system faults, or near-unstable situations such as limit handling under driver-assist feedback control. Historically, many have advocated the use of <b>scale</b> <b>vehicles</b> as surrogates for larger vehicles. This article presents analysis and experimental testing that examines the fidelity of using <b>scaled</b> <b>vehicles</b> for vehicle chassis dynamics and control studies. In support of this effort, this work introduces an experimental system called the Pennsylvania State University Rolling Roadway Simulator (the PURRS). In the PURRS, a custom-built scale-sized vehicle is freely driven on a moving roadway surface. While others have used scale-vehicle rolling roadway simulators in the past, this work {{is the first to}} attempt to directly match the planar dynamic performance of the scale-sized vehicle to a specific full-sized vehicle by careful design of the <b>scale</b> <b>vehicle.</b> This article explains details of this effort including vehicle dynamic modeling, detailed measurement of model parameters, conditions for dynamic similitude, validation of the resulting experimental vehicle in the time, frequency, and dimensionless domains. The results of the dynamic comparisons between scale- and full-sized vehicles clearly illustrate operational regimes where agreement is quite good, and other regimes where agreement is quite poor. Both are useful to understand the applicability of scale-vehicle results to full-size vehicle analysis...|$|R

50|$|The DC-X, {{short for}} Delta Clipper Experimental, was an {{unmanned}} one third <b>scale</b> SSTO <b>vehicle</b> which {{was too small}} to actually achieve orbit but was instead built to demonstrate vertical takeoff and landing.

Several other prototypes of this design were proposed, including the DC-X2 (a half-scale prototype) and the DC-Y, a full <b>scale</b> <b>vehicle</b> which would be capable of single stage insertion into orbit. Neither of these were built, but the project was taken over by NASA in 1995, and they built the DC-XA, an upgraded one third <b>scale</b> prototype. This <b>vehicle</b> was lost when it landed with only three of its four landing pads deployed, which caused it to tip over on its side and explode. The project has not been continued since.|$|R

For 1/10 <b>scale</b> R/C <b>vehicles,</b> 2 in ABS piping fits snug over the appropriate wheels for that <b>scale</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Drift tires can also be created out of white PVC piping due to the inherent frictionless behavior exhibited by PVC on concrete; however, the inherent white coloration of the material can be undesirable.
