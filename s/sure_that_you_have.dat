60|$|And I wish I {{was quite}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> all found these wanderings pleasant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I am very <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a mind {{capable of}} doing the most liberal justice to {{everything}} interesting and beautiful. You are extremely intelligent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{found out}} your own feelings?" [...] Staveley said at last; and {{his tone was}} then serious enough even for his friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "When, therefore, {{you told}} the jury <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were nearly <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{witnessed}} three signatures of Sir Joseph's in one day, that was truth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some strong spirit must go with you, Lord Macumazana," [...] he said, [...] "that {{you should}} live today, {{after we were}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been slain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know why}} I left you, father; and I {{had reason to}} {{distrust}} you, because I felt <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> deceived my mother. If I could <b>have</b> trusted <b>you,</b> I would <b>have</b> stayed with <b>you</b> and worked for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Once more Streuss felt {{an uneasy}} pang of incredulity. After all, was this Englishman playing with him? So he asked: [...] "You are quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Dom Clemente dryly, [...] "is another matter. I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> spoiled them. I would, however, like to {{hear your}} reasons for meddling with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and more}} bitter than before, since he cannot find the Pearl-Maiden, and is <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{spirited}} her away. Be advised {{by me and}} leave Rome quickly, lest worse things befall you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} bother {{any more about}} it," [...] Alice said decidedly. [...] "Uncle Harry and I are all quite, quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing to do with}} that horrible business, and that ought to be quite enough for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'MY DEAREST LUCY,--Until I met Mr. Prendergast yesterday, I was not [...] <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{actually}} returned, or I {{would not}} have delayed an [...] hour in assuring you, if you could doubt it, that my pardon is ever [...] ready for you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peste, Philip!" [...] Francois said, as {{he removed}} his helmet. [...] "I was not wrong when I said that, from your figure, I was <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> learned fencing. Maitre Charles {{interfered}} on my behalf, and to save me the mortification of defeat. I had nearly shot my bolt, and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> scarcely begun.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} to explain myself, papa; but we all know that it is very sad, and are quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> never meant for one moment to do {{anything}} that was wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true you are smaller, but I {{am not so}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> more enemies," [...] replied Jumper thoughtfully. [...] "It {{sometimes}} {{seems to me that}} I couldn't have more, especially in winter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{brought me}} to the right place?" [...] I asked the man who held the door open. [...] "This seems to be a warehouse. I think there must be some mistake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{time has}} not yet come," [...] he said. [...] "Confusion and {{misunderstanding}} must increase before they can diminish. But I <b>have</b> hopes of <b>you,</b> Hugh, or I shouldn't have spoken. I shan't be here now--of course I'll {{keep in touch with}} you. I wanted to be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> the right view of this thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I am heartily {{glad to see}} you again, Karl. I was by {{no means}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> got off safely at Hochkirch. I looked round for <b>you,</b> {{directly}} I <b>had</b> been captured; but could see nothing of you, and knew not whether <b>you</b> <b>had</b> ridden off, or had been killed by that volley that finished poor Turk, and brought about my capture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “When you did {{not return}} that evening, señor, Pita and I went out to search for you. We knew where you {{generally}} sat, but you were gone. We went to the mission, got some torches, and searching in the sand between the rocks we found traces of Indians’ feet, {{and were able to}} follow them up to a point nearly a mile below the falls. There they ceased, and we were <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been carried off in a canoe. As we found no sign whatever of blood or marks of a struggle we felt <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not been wounded, but concluded <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been suddenly seized, bound, and carried off. We roused some of the mission Indians, and I with three of them took to our canoe and paddled down the river for twelve hours. As we had no weight to carry and had four paddles, we felt <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> by that time we should <b>have</b> overtaken <b>you</b> <b>had</b> they held on down the river, for we concluded by the footmarks that there were but three of them, and they had your weight in the boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps because I like Hugh," [...] Lady Conyers went on quietly, [...] "perhaps, too, because I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done wisely. You haven't {{given me}} any reason yet, have you, for {{breaking}} your engagement?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be silly," [...] she protested. [...] "For one thing, it is splendid to be {{a capable}} soldier. You are {{just what the}} country wants to-day. But apart from that I am quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> brains." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can {{say that}} with most perfect truth. I do not blame you. It has been most unfortunate; but I do not blame you. I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{struggled}} {{to do the best}} that you could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{went away}} at once. After a time, {{he began to}} write to me, urging me to change my decision; and from this, {{although}} he never said so, I was <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> refused to sanction his marriage. However, I stuck to what I had said, though {{it was hard for}} me to do so, with my child growing thin and pale before my eyes, with all her bright happiness gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, my good friend," [...] he said, [...] "I am truly {{glad to see}} <b>you!</b> I made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were dead. You {{were not}} among those who came out, and gave {{themselves}} up, or among those who were captured when the city was taken; for I had careful inquiry made, thinking it possible <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might <b>have</b> lost my ring, and been unable to obtain access to me; then, at last, I made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> fallen. I am truly {{glad to see that}} it is not so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Mackinnor," [...] she said, [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must <b>have</b> {{heard of}} Mr. David Courtlaw. Permit {{me to make}} him known to you--Mr. Courtlaw--Lady Mackinnor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{you choose}} that! Well, {{that was a}} great {{favourite}} of poor Sir Thomas Lawrence. But for my part I have never seen any one in the least like it, and I think I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot understand," [...] she said, [...] "why {{he should}} have refused to share his {{knowledge}} with you. He is an American--it is almost {{the same thing as}} being an Englishman. And you are friends,--I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> helped him often." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And even that," [...] the Duchess remarked, smiling, [...] "has been yellow for {{the last}} few days. Prince, you know my {{daughter}} Grace, and I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> met Miss Penelope Morse? We are waiting for two other men, Sir Charles Somerfield and Mr. Vanderpole." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{are quite}} <b>sure,</b> Jacob, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done with Mr. Slippen? I should {{not like him}} to think <b>that</b> I <b>had</b> taken <b>you</b> away from him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't help it, Dick," [...] she said, [...] "so {{it is of}} no {{use your}} scolding me. This is a surprise. Who {{would have thought of}} your coming back so soon? But it is lucky you did. Your mother has been in a sad way, and she was so <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been in some terrible danger, that I have been almost as anxious as she has. And now, it seems that I need not have frightened myself at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I did {{not know}} what was best to do. It seemed to me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must {{certainly}} be killed. If I <b>had</b> been <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been wounded and taken prisoner I should have gone back; but even then I might, more likely than not, have been shot by the Austrians before I could explain matters. But I really thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were killed; and as, from the shouting and firing, {{it seemed to me that}} the enemy had it all their own way there, I rode back to the farmhouse.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{not what}} I {{intended}} to say. But if you are <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> enjoyed to the full the reaction of joy after despair with which I have kindly provided you free of charge, let us get down to our mail, as the saying goes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. De la Borne," [...] she said, [...] "I {{think that}} you have been very unjust and very rude to Major Forrest, who is an old friend of mine. I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been misled, and I am sure that some day you will ask his pardon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{every one}} of us!" [...] she answered. [...] "To you, even, who live in Thorpe. Remember my words {{when you get home}} to-night, or when you wake in the morning. As for you, Wilhelmina, I am not at all <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not already met with your adventure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{decided at}} once not {{to attempt to}} come to the rendezvous. In the first place, I felt <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> already {{followed}} out my instructions; and in the next place, <b>had</b> I joined <b>you,</b> I should <b>have</b> ruined your chance of escape. Being dismounted, I should have hampered your flight and, even had we escaped pursuit, your having a man with a broken arm with <b>you</b> would, everywhere, <b>have</b> roused suspicion. I therefore determined to go as far as I could, and then hide in a wood and shift for myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind indeed," [...] she said. [...] "I have never crossed before, and I am quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{the time to}} spare, you can be ever so useful to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> been wise if you had," [...] said Merril, with a {{whimsical}} grimace. [...] "I don't {{seem to have}} been very successful with my own affairs of late. Anyway, you haven't told me what I asked." ...|$|R
