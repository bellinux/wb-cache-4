5000|$|The next day, Ben and Chuck {{go down in}} the submarine. The Megalodon attacks a yacht, {{slamming}} into it a couple of times, knocking several people overboard. They escape to two large <b>safety</b> <b>rafts.</b> Ruiz steals a woman's life jacket and jumps off the yacht, only to be swallowed whole by the shark, as is one of the rafts. Tolley attempts to escape on a jet ski, but he ends up driving straight into the Megalodon's wide open maw[...] Chuck then goes into the water and tags the shark. Ben eventually launches the torpedo, which succeeds in destroying the creature. Ben swims to the surface with Chuck and climbs into the raft. They all celebrate their success. However, at a different location near a rocky island, another megalodon appears but Ben, Chuck and Cat and the other survivors are unaware of its presence.|$|R
60|$|The arm was chopped through, and {{the boat}} was freed from the tree which had, in the first place, so nearly {{destroyed}} it, but which, in the end, had proved their means of <b>safety.</b> The <b>raft</b> was fastened alongside by a rope, and the negroes betook themselves to it for the night, while the two white men, as before, lay down {{to sleep on the}} cabin-top.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the area, <b>safety</b> {{regulations}} covering <b>rafting,</b> {{both for}} the general do-it-yourself public as well as commercial operators, may exist in legislation. These range from the mandatory wearing of lifejackets, carrying certain equipment such as whistles and throwable flotation devices, to certification of commercial outfitters and their employees. It is generally advisable to discuss safety measures with a commercial rafting operator before signing on for that type of trip. The required equipment needed is essential information to be considered.|$|R
50|$|While Gus and Beeea free Noé {{from his}} cage, Newmann tries to draw Félix to him using Lincesa as bait. Unexpectedly, Newmann causes an {{explosion}} that starts to flood the ship, beginning an evacuation protocol of the caged animals. While fighting Newmann, Félix has an epiphany that by {{holding on to}} the hunter, he will be prone to injury by his own traps, thanks to Félix's bad luck. This leads to Newmann seemingly crushed to death by a large trap. Félix, Lincesa, the animals, and Noé make it to <b>safety</b> in life <b>rafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|On November 18, 2015 Le Boreal {{suffered}} a major engine room fire which caused {{the loss of}} all power and left her drifting. The captain ordered the ship, with 347 passengers and crew, to be abandoned early in the morning. A distress call was issued just after 2 a.m. while it was near Cape Dolphin, the northerly point of East Falkland, Falkland Islands. The news agency reported that 90 of the ship's 347 passengers and crew were air-lifted to <b>safety</b> from life <b>rafts.</b> The sister ship L'Austral responded to the distress call and took on some passengers.|$|R
50|$|Twenty-seven-year-old Donald Williamson was {{the first}} rescuer on the scene. After working a late shift at the Goodyear Tire plant, the former lake {{freighter}} deckhand wanted to see Noronic, which he knew was in port. He arrived {{to the sound of}} the ship’s distress whistle, as the fire was quickly growing and people were frantically jumping into the lake. Spotting a large painters’ raft nearby, he untied it and pushed it into a position near the ship’s port bow. As people leapt from the burning ship, he pulled them from the water to the <b>safety</b> of the <b>raft.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On Monday 5 July 1999 the Wolverhampton {{area was}} hit by storms which {{included}} a twister. This caused torrential flooding across Pendeford with water reaching depths of 5 ft in places. Just as families were recovering from the [...] "twister" [...] storms, some faced second insurance claims for new damage to their properties when a second storm hit on Sunday 1 August. Residents were ferried to <b>safety</b> on inflatable <b>rafts</b> by firemen as flood water up to 4 ft deep from torrential rain swept into their homes. Temporary accommodation was made available at Pendeford High School.|$|R
5000|$|Jessica Roux (born 10 November 1992 in Port Elizabeth) is a South African {{distance}} swimmer. Her club is the Swimcats/Bay Eagle Swim Team, and she {{is based}} in Durban. [...] She is also trained in hockey and water polo. At {{the time of the}} 2012 Olympics she was a student at Varsity College. She trained for the 2012 Summer Olympics in the bay at Cape Town where the water is colder. At the 2012 olympics in London she competed in the Women's marathon 10 kilometre, but didn't complete the race, and had to be taken to <b>safety</b> on a <b>raft</b> and taken away in a wheelchair.|$|R
5000|$|Unfortunately, the {{destroyer}} — an Asiatic Fleet flushdecker [...] "old enough to vote" [...] — could not elude her pursuers. Ultimately, damaged by Japanese bombs, from aircraft summoned from the Japanese carrier Ryūjō, and by shells from the Japanese force, Pope began to sink, {{but not before}} {{all but one of}} her men had reached <b>safety</b> in life <b>rafts</b> and {{the destroyer}}'s sole motor whaleboat. Antrim, wounded in the action, helped to gather the life rafts around the boat to facilitate the distribution of what meager supplies were available to the men. His devotion to duty during the ordeal inspired and sustained his shipmates' morale.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, a settlement-based method is {{proposed}} to design piled raft foundation. The proposed design method {{is found to}} be very efficient, economical and requires less calculation time. Simple software can be used to execute all the interactions and loop calculations. Unlike methods with numerical techniques, there are practically no limitations for the number of individual piles under the raft, size of the group and the group shape or layout. It can also be applied to piles with different length or piles that are located within multi-layered soils. The raft is designed first according to the allowable settlement that is pre-defined by the structural requirements and with the necessary factor of <b>safety.</b> When <b>raft</b> suffers excessive settlement, then the load that causes excess raft settlement beyond the required limit is to be transferred to the fully mobilised frictional piles. The fully mobilised shaft (with no end bearing) piles are designed with factor of safety close to unity since their function is only to reduce raft settlement and since the raft has an adequate bearing capacity. Geometry of these piles is chosen to fully mobilise their shafts capacity with low settlement level in order to comply with load/settlement requirement and reduce raft settlement to the pre-defined level.

5000|$|... "The President of the United States of America, in {{the name}} of Congress, takes pride in {{presenting}} the Medal of Honor (Posthumously) to Private George Watson, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in action on 8 March 1943, while serving with 29th Quarter Master Regiment, in action at Porloch Harbor, New Guinea. Private Watson was on board a ship which was attacked and hit by enemy bombers. When the ship was abandoned, Private Watson, instead of seeking to save himself, remained in the water assisting several soldiers who could not swim to reach the <b>safety</b> of the <b>raft.</b> This heroic action, which subsequently cost him his life, resulted in the saving of several of his comrades. Weakened by his exertions, he was dragged down by the suction of the sinking ship and was drowned. Private Watson's extraordinarily valorous actions, daring leadership, and self-sacrificing devotion to his fellow-man exemplify the finest traditions of military service." ...|$|R
40|$|State {{of the art}} Report:Selected {{topics in}} the field of pile {{foundations}} are addressed. The effects of the installation technique on the bearing capacity and the load-settlement response of a single pile are discussed. The latter effect is shown to be less significant; a settlement controlled design is thus less dependent on the technological factors. Monitoring of the installation parameters shows some potential for controlling the pile response. The available experimental evidence on the behaviour of pile foundations under vertical loads (settlement, load sharing, bearing capacity), by monitoring of full scale structures or by research experiments, is reviewed. Simple empirical methods for a preliminary evaluation of the settlement are suggested. The (more limited) evidence about horizontal loading is also reviewed and discussed. The methods for the analysis of pile foundations under vertical load are next reported. They may be considered satisfactory for engineering purposes, provided they are used paying due attention to the correspondence relations between theories and reality. The criteria for an optimum design, achieving maximum economy while keeping satisfactory performances, are different for different kinds of pile foundations (small groups, large <b>rafts).</b> <b>Safety</b> against a bearing capacity failure, average settlement, differential settlement, moment and shear in the raft and cost are the quantities to be controlled. It is claimed that the conventional capacity based approach, still prevailing in practice, is not suited to develop a proper design. Present codes and regulations, essentially based on this approach, at the time being act as a restraint rather than a stimulus and need some revision...|$|R
5000|$|In summer 2007, Li Ming Wong {{organised}} {{a tournament}} in Los Angeles. A few {{days into the}} trip, Jarvis arranged for him, Eric, Scrapper, Gerald, Fabian, Phil and Callum to have a plane tour of the Grand Canyon. However, plane trouble soon forced the pilots to crash-land in the water. Scrapper took the others on a raft to go for help. However, the strong current blew the raft off course, leaving the five in the raft in danger and Jarvis and the two pilots stranded. With a flare gun and a rope from the cockpit, Nick and the pilots were able to pull themselves to <b>safety.</b> The players' <b>raft</b> went down a waterfall, leaving the five stranded in a clearing. Scrapper and Callum went to find food, as Gerald told Eric, Fabian and Phil the legend of Bigfoot. The anxious players hear a gunshot from the woods. Three hillbillies emerge and engage in conversation with the players before Scrapper returns with Callum, attacks the hillbillies and escapes {{with the rest of}} the team. They find refuge in a cave, and Scrapper volunteers to search for the nearest town. When the others awaken, they find a large, gorilla-like monster standing at the cave's entrance. Gerald screams, only for the [...] "monster" [...] to pull off its fake head and reveal itself as Scrapper. The hillbillies, he explained, wanted him to wear this costume to bring back tourists and make people think a Bigfoot-type creature lived there. Openshaw wanted to leave, and looked for Scrapper. When he sees a gorilla-type monster searching through a bin and calls it, Scrapper asked why he was shouting. They turned to see the real monster, and ran for their lives.|$|R
