25|$|It {{is unclear}} {{to what extent}} fish {{played a role in}} the cuisine, but it is {{apparent}} that fish became steadily more available during the Israelite and Judean monarchies. Fish products were salted and dried and sent great distances. However, even in the later Persian, Greek and Roman periods, the cost of preserving and transporting fish must have meant that only wealthier inhabitants of the highland towns and cities could afford it, or those who lived close to the sources, where it was less expensive. In the Galilee, <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> was a fundamental component of the agrarian economy.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examined}} {{the efficiency of}} resource utilisation in pond fish production in Delta State, Nigeria, using a production function approach. Data for the study were obtained from {{a cross section of}} 72 farms using a multi-stage sampling procedure. The farms had a total water surface area of 101. 15 hectares. Regression results indicated that pond size, feeds, fingerlings, and labour were significant (p < 0. 05) determinants of output in pond fish production. The index of resource-use efficiency revealed that fish farmers were not only inefficient in the allocation of productive resources, but grossly over-utilised feeds, fingerlings, fixed costs, and labour with an allocative efficiency index of 0. 0025, 0. 00064, – 0. 00017, and 0. 00025 respectively. Pond size was however, under-utilised with an allocative efficiency index of 3. 22. Given the under-utilisation of pond size, strategies aimed at increasing farm size will thus significantly improve efficiency of utilisation of other resources. This, in addition to enhanced access to current technical and price information by farmers, will raise output and net returns in <b>small-scale</b> <b>fish</b> farming enterprises.

40|$|This booklet aims at {{providing}} {{basic information}} on how to set up a <b>small-scale</b> <b>fish</b> farm for subsistence purposes with regard to daily protein needs. Since practices are so diverse, this manual focuses on land-based, freshwater fish farming. In the tropics, pond fish farming is {{the most common form of}} aquaculture and so, the information provided concerns pond construction and pond management. The first part of this manual describes the principles of fish farming, including site selection and type of fish farm. Fish farming practices are presented, including the selection of species, nutrition, health aspects, reproduction, harvesting and pond maintenance. The second part gives specific information about the culture of common carp, tilapia and catfish. <b>Small-scale</b> freshwater <b>fish</b> farming Agrodok series no 15 by A van Eer, T van Schie and A Hilbrands available from CTASmall-scale freshwater fish farming Agrodok series no 15 by A van Eer, T van Schie and A Hilbrands available from CT...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} three areas: quality control at farm level, quality {{assurance}} at chain level, {{and the business}} relationships at farm level. The objective of this thesis is to explore the major challenges for the present quality management system to assure safety and quality standards in the export supply chain of <b>small-scale</b> <b>fish</b> farming in Vietnam. The findings show that problems of small-scale farmers involved in export supply chain {{can be dealt with}} through developing business relations between chain actors. To establish a well-organized fish supply chain, it is crucial to encourage small-scale farmers to develop horizontal co-operation. Through co-operation, farmers can access inputs and extension services more easily, can improve product quality, increase quantity and achieve economies of scale, and increase bargaining power with buyers. Farmers need to be trained, organized, and willing to innovate. It leads to the improvement of farmers’ awareness through increased information and knowledge (i. e. better management practices system). Similarly, it is vital for <b>small-scale</b> <b>fish</b> farmers to develop business relations with processing/export firms through flexible contract farming. In the Pangasius supply chain, the processing/export firms are generally the most powerful stakeholders, playing a leading role in organizing chain quality management. They get the information from the importers of fish quality standards. Government can contribute to provide an enabling environment, including transparent regulations concerning food safety and quality and availability of certified inputs [...] ...|$|R

The existence of two states, moving and holding, {{is suggested by}} anecdotal information from a large radio-tagging study; yet, data describing such observations of <b>small-scale</b> <b>fish</b> behavior are not adequate to estimate transition probabilities directly. Instead, we estimate the transition probability matrix from travel times within each of 11 river segments using a method of moments approach. Bootstrapped confidence intervals are presented. The precision of parameter estimates is improved by incorporating information on river velocity at each observation station. Results suggest differences in fish behavior between river segments.

40|$|There {{is now an}} {{increasing}} demand among consumers for high-quality and safe aquaculture products. However, in becoming an important contributor to the markets for seafood, the aquaculture industry has become increasingly subject to rigid food safety, traceability, and processing requirements (e. g. Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP), Good Aquaculture Practice (GAP) etc.). In these recent trends, <b>small-scale</b> <b>fish</b> farmers, especially in developing countries and countries in transition, have encountered difficulties in meeting such requirements. On the other hand, although traceability {{is one of the}} latest issue in food trade market, there are still different requirements (and definition) in different country and organization. This paper conducts questionnaire surveys and in-depth interviews, and examines the traceability system and supply chain system of the farmed fish industry. Otherwise, In order to reach the spirit of "traceability ", we also take Taiwan seafood industry as an example to show that how traceability and food safety conform the production responsibility, the independent management, food security. Empirical results show that with sustainability, traceability and food safety as the core components, there is a critical need for countries within the region (e. g. Asia) to forge international collaboration, harmonization and transborder policies to develop standards and mechanisms for HACCP, GAP/GHP/GMP, and/or traceability implementation. These standards must not only be accessible to large commercial/industrial production, but must also be beneficial to <b>small-scale</b> <b>fish</b> farmers. Finally, this research provides recommendations for integrating the producing and marketing channels, sustainable development and market strategy for the aquaculture industry are also discussed...|$|R
