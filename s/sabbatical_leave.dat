5|$|Charles Buller Heberden became {{principal}} in 1889. He saw sporting {{as a means}} to the institution of civility than an end in itself; together with Richard Lodge, it was this spirit that dominated his tenure as principal. Academic rigour was reintroduced to the college, and the staff of Brasenose were increasingly successful in maintaining discipline. Until the end of the century, however, the number of students achieving blues outnumbered those attaining firsts. Author John Buchan joined in 1895, a man of this new era– although his work continued to portray Brasenose as its previous muscular stereotype. Heberden was also the first lay principal, although he was personally committed to the church– purchasing an organ for the chapel out of his own personal funds. Brasenose was frequently represented as boasting no academic prowess at all. Three of the ten fellows were set aside for non-classicists; a Junior Common Room (JCR) was created in 1887; in 1897 the library was opened up to undergraduates; in 1899, Fellows were granted a right to <b>sabbatical</b> <b>leave.</b> The fellows themselves were increasingly secular; only four of fourteen fellows were clergy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractImproving the <b>Sabbatical</b> <b>leaves</b> {{of absence}} from the {{university}} by the faculty members as a continuing process; require assessment of outcomes or impacts and reorganization of influencing factors in comprehensive approach. Getting feedback from faculty members for integrating their perspectives in planning processes as a participatory and accountable action - reactioninteraction chain, is main objective of this research. Methodologically, surveying research using quantitative research paradigm based on questionnaire has been in concern. Researcher's designed questionnaire was collected from 120 selected faculty members, using statistical simple random sampling method. Data has been collected in the year 2004 and was analyzed by using factor analyzing technique using SPSS software. According to findings the impacts of <b>sabbatical</b> <b>leaves</b> of absence of faculty members, can be classified in five components. The first factor called the professionalization factor explained 32. 4 % of the total variance. The second factor called the psychological/ cultural effects explained 19. 3 % of the variances. The third factor called Social - scientific capacity-building factor explained 17. 8 % of the variances. The forth factor called institutional productivity explaining 10 % and finally the fifth factor was called individual motivation's factor explaining 8. 9 % of the Total variances. In conclusion, based on obtained findings, some appropriate mechanisms are suggested for improving the <b>sabbatical</b> <b>leaves</b> of absence for faculty members, such as strategic planning and proper policy making...|$|R
