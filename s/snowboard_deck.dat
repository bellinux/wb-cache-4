25|$|Bindings are {{separate}} components from the <b>snowboard</b> <b>deck</b> {{and are very}} important parts of the total snowboard interface. The bindings' main function is to hold the rider's boot in place tightly to transfer their energy to the board. Most bindings {{are attached to the}} board with three or four screws that are placed {{in the center of the}} binding. Although a rather new technology from Burton called Infinite channel system uses two screws, both on the outsides of the binding.|$|E

50|$|Mountainboard decks are {{the part}} {{that most of the}} {{components}} are attached to, and provide the base for the rider to stand on. They are generally from 90-110 cm in length, and can be made from a range of construction methods and materials. For example, high specification boards may be made from composite carbon and glass reinforced plastics, possibly with a wooden core, similarly made to a <b>snowboard</b> <b>deck.</b> Basic decks are generally made using laminated wood pressed into shape, comparable to a longboard deck with larger dimensions and a different shape. There are variable characteristics such as flex, weight, shape, length and tip angle that can be catered for in custom or stock boards from a variety of manufacturers.|$|E
