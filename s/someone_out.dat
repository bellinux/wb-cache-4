Most accounts tell the story that Shackleton saw Joyce on a bus that was passing his expedition offices, sent <b>someone</b> <b>out</b> to fetch him, and recruited him on the spot. To join the expedition, Joyce bought his release from the Navy; in later years he would claim that Shackleton had failed to recompense him for this, despite a promise to do so, one of several disputes over money and recognition which would strain [...] his relations with Shackleton. [...] Joyce, Shackleton and Frank Wild were the only members of the expedition with previous Antarctic experience, and {{on the basis of his}} Discovery exploits, Joyce was put in charge of the [...] new expedition's general stores, sledges and dogs. Before departure in August 1907, he and Wild took a crash course in printing at Sir Joseph Causton's printing firm in Hampshire, as Shackleton intended to publish a book or magazine while in the Antarctic.|$|E

500|$|The International Cricket Council (ICC), {{responsible}} for running the game worldwide, conducted {{a trial in}} 2002 where lbw appeals could be referred to a match official, the third umpire, to review on television replays. The third umpire could only use technology to determine where the ball had pitched and if the batsman hit the ball with his bat. The ICC judged the experiment unsuccessful and did not pursue it. More trials followed in 2006, although ball-tracking technology remained unavailable to match officials. After a further series of trials, in 2009 the Umpire Decision Review System (DRS) was brought into international cricket where teams could refer the on-field decisions of umpires to a third umpire who had access to television replays and technology such as ball tracking. According to the ICC's general manager, Dave Richardson, DRS increased {{the frequency with which}} umpires awarded lbw decisions. In a 2012 interview, he said: [...] "Umpires may have realised that if they give <b>someone</b> <b>out</b> and DRS shows it was not out, then their decision can be rectified. So they might, I suppose, have the courage of their convictions a bit more and take a less conservative approach to giving the batsman out. I think if we're totally honest, DRS has affected the game slightly more than we thought it would." ...|$|E

Instead, the character {{was supposed to be}} motivated only by enjoyment and free from mean spiritedness. He is generous, kind, and optimistic, and several of his plots involve helping <b>someone</b> <b>out.</b> He tries to please his sister Candace, carving her face into Mount Rushmore for her birthday in one episode and helping her retrieve a tape detailing his summer adventures even though she intended on using the footage as evidence to [...] "bust" [...] him and Ferb.

He offers Stewie a sip, and they both become so drunk that Brian agrees to pierce Stewie's ear with a pin from his sweater, leaving Stewie with a bloody ear {{for the rest of}} the episode. Stewie and Brian discuss The Dog Whisperer and Cesar Millan, and Brian {{explains}} that he is inspired by the philosophy about dogs' instinctive ability to live in the present and with purpose. Stewie, however, points out that Brian himself does not appear to live with any specific purpose. Angered at the implication, Brian begins insulting Stewie, who bitterly retaliates by revealing that he could have gone all day without having his diaper changed, and only thinks of Brian as a passing amusement and [...] "the best of a bad situation". Stewie dares Brian to shoot him with the revolver in the deposit, which Brian earlier said to be bullet-free. It is revealed that Brian lied, and he attempts to shoot Stewie. The two then find a security camera hanging on a wall of the vault. Brian tries to use it to call for help, but Stewie points out if there was <b>someone</b> <b>out</b> there, they would have been saved. Brian then realizes that the camera has recorded him cleaning Stewie, which amuses the infant, but Brian is upset about gaining a laughingstock reputation. Stewie then prematurely causes the gun to discharge, causing the bullet to randomly ricochet off the vault walls, smashing Stewie's already-broken phone and the bottle of Scotch, and forcing the two under the table.|$|E

500|$|The fifth {{match of}} the event was an Intercontinental Championship match between The Ultimate Warrior and the reigning {{champion}} The Honky Tonk Man, who was accompanied by Jimmy Hart. Before the match it had been announced that Honky's original challenger, Brutus Beefcake, was unable to wrestle due to being attacked the previous week by Outlaw Ron Bass who had raked his cowboy spurs repeatedly across Beefcake's forehead (television and even the PPV only showed the censored version of the attack). Prior to the match, the Honky Tonk Man refused to be informed about Beefcake's replacement and immediately before the match, even grabbed ring announcer Howard Finkel's microphone and said [...] "Give me <b>someone</b> <b>out</b> here to wrestle, I don't care who it is". His challenge was answered by The Ultimate Warrior. Warrior, who accidentally knocked Finkel to the floor when he rushed into the ring and hit the ropes, had the advantage from the beginning, attacking The Honky Tonk Man, who {{was still in his}} entrance attire. After body-slamming him to the mat and following it up with a clothesline, The Warrior bounded to the ropes and landed stomach-first on The Honky Tonk Man using his signature move, the Warrior Splash. The Ultimate Warrior then pinned The Honky Tonk Man after only thirty-one seconds to win the title. The longest Intercontinental title reign in WWF history had ended with one of the shortest IC title matches in history. This match was probably the one where the audience cheered the loudest; the moment the Warrior defeated the hapless Honky Tonk Man, the fans erupted with cheers, with many even voting it the match of the year.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1998, a {{young woman}} {{standing}} at a Los Angeles bus stop was taken at knife point to a deserted parking lot and raped by an unknown assailant. A bagel shop manager, Luis Vargas, {{was arrested and charged}} with this crime and with assaults on two other young women. Despite the fact that coworkers at the bagel shop placed him there at the time of the rape (which occurred 20 miles away), based upon ambiguous and contradictory identifications made by the three women, and upon a prior conviction for raping a former girlfriend, Vargas was convicted of the crimes. Vargas stated at the time of his sentencing to 55 years to life in prison on December 7, 1999, [...] "As far as I’m concerned, [...] individual [...] really did these crimes might really be raping <b>someone</b> <b>out</b> there, might really be killing <b>someone</b> <b>out</b> there." [...] Vargas' prophecy proved correct, as rapes and other assaults on women with a similar modus operandi continued to take place, not only after Vargas was sentenced, but even during the time between his arrest and conviction. The CIP became interested in Vargas' case in 2011, when Vargas sent the organization press clippings about recent assaults similar to those of 1998, which were attributed to a serial attacker known as the [...] "Teardrop Rapist." [...] The CIP requested that the clothes of the 1998 rape victim be examined for DNA, using technology not available at the time. The DNA samples did not match Vargas' DNA... but did match DNA taken from recent victims whose attacker matched the profile of the Teardrop Rapist. In September 2015, Vargas was exonerated of the crimes for which he had served nearly 16 years in prison. It was the CIP's third DNA exoneration and its 20th overall. Vargas is currently engaged in a civil suit against the Los Angeles Police Department, prosecutors and others, claiming that exonerating evidence was withheld at his original trial. Vargas' case was noted in an article citing the record number of exonerations that occurred in 2015.|$|E
2500|$|While Microsoft {{says that}} product {{activation}} benefits consumers by allowing Microsoft to produce higher quality software, it has nevertheless received much criticism regarding its design and implementation, effectiveness at stopping piracy and respect of privacy rights.

2500|$|Pantridge's {{article also}} {{energized}} Leonard Cobb in Seattle. He knew the Seattle Fire Department was already involved in first aid and therefore approached the Fire Chief, Gordon Vickery, {{to propose a}} new training program to treat cardiac arrest. The fire department already {{had one of the}} United States' first computerized systems for documenting first aid runs. Cobb realized that this system could provide scientific documentation for the efficacy (or lack thereof) of Pantridge's suggestions and suggested to Vickery that they pool their knowledge and resources. Cobb and his colleagues then provided instruction and training in cardiac emergencies including cardiac arrest to volunteer fire fighters. The program became operational in March 1970, nine months after Nagel's first save in Miami. The mobile unit was stationed outside the Harborview Hospital emergency department. As Cobb himself points out, the mobile unit was not the real innovation. Rather, it was the concept of a tiered response to medical emergencies. The idea was [...] "that we would get <b>someone</b> <b>out</b> there quickly"—via the fire department's already existing mobile first aid units—"and then a secondary response would come from the mobile intensive coronary care unit." [...] The beauty of the tiered response system was the efficient use of fire department personnel, which allowed aid personnel to reach the scene quickly (on an average of three minutes) to start CPR. Then a few minutes later the paramedics arrived to provide more definitive care such as defibrillation. In this way the brain could be kept alive until the electric shock converted the heart to a normal rhythm. After stabilization the paramedics would transport the patient to the hospital.|$|E
2500|$|... "Witness" [...] is not {{the only}} episode to be altered from its {{original}} concept. [...] "Dichotic" [...] began, in its early stages, as a story about a news reporter who had the ability—thanks to kryptonite—to split himself in half. The reporter would create the news {{at the same time that}} he was filming it. Ken Biller and Mark Verheiden discussed a teaser that involved the reporter pushing <b>someone</b> <b>out</b> of a window and as the body plummeted to the ground the audience saw the same person reporting the news as it happened. The main story would focus on the reporter attempting to assassinate Lex Luthor, but it eventually evolved into what Biller refers to as [...] "a metaphor on trying to super-achieve at high school". In the revamped version, a high school student uses his ability to duplicate himself so that he can take classes in high school and at the community college at the same time, in an effort to win a LuthorCorp scholarship and go to the university of his dreams. With Jonathan Taylor Thomas playing the over-achieving student, the character of Ian Randall was also used to stir up the Lana-Clark-Chloe triangle. Beeman explains that a problem exists in developing new storylines involving the characters: [...] "We want the characters we're familiar with, and on the other , you have to search for ways to change them up." [...] Even the ending was altered during filming, as both copies of Ian were to fall over the edge of a bridge; then, as the two Ians fall they touch each other's fingers slowly fusing together before hitting the ground. The team was so impressed with Thomas's performance they opted to keep the character alive.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the law on}} {{disclosure}} and misrepresentation aims to make contracting parties informed (or not disinformed), the law also says agreements may be avoided when, in a very general sense, a person's free will was impaired. Complete exercise of [...] "free will" [...] is rare for most people, because they make choices within a constrained range of alternatives. The law still holds people to nearly all contracts (if consumer, employment, tenancy, etc. legislation is not activated) except where someone was under duress, unduly influenced or exploited while in a vulnerable position. Like misrepresentation, the victim may avoid the contract, and the parties restore their property to reverse unjust enrichment, subject to the victim's claim for damages, so long as none of the four equitable bars to rescission lie (i.e. no excessive lapse of time, affirmation of the contract, intervention of an innocent third party's rights and counter-restitution is possible). The most straight forward claim, for duress, involves illegitimate threats. The common law long allowed a claim if duress was of a physical nature. So long as a threat {{is just one of}} the reasons a person enters an agreement, even if not the main reason, the agreement may be avoided. Only late in the 20th century was escape allowed if the threat involved illegitimate economic harm. A threat is always [...] "illegitimate" [...] if it is to do an unlawful act, such as breaking a contract knowing non-payment may push <b>someone</b> <b>out</b> of business. However, threatening to do a lawful act will usually not be illegitimate. In Pao on v Lau Yiu Long the Pao family threatened to not complete a share swap deal, aimed at selling their company's building, unless the Lau family agreed to change a part of the proposed agreement to guarantee the Paos would receive rises in the swapped shares' prices on repurchase. The Laus signed the guarantee agreement after this threat, and then claimed it was not binding. But the Privy Council advised their signature was only a result of [...] "commercial pressure", not economic duress. The Laus' considered the situation before signing, and did not behave like someone under duress, so there was no coercion amounting to a vitiation of consent. However, contrasting to cases involving business parties, the threat to do a lawful act will probably be duress if used against a vulnerable person. An obvious case involving [...] "lawful act duress" [...] is blackmail. The blackmailer has to justify, not doing the lawful act they threaten, but against a person highly vulnerable to them, the demand of money.|$|E
