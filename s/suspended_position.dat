60|$|At this time, however, while Edgar Berrington stood {{watching}} them, {{these two men}} seemed to have found an apple of discord of unusual size--to judge from the energetic display of feeling which it occasioned. Edgar never ascertained what the bale in dispute contained, but he saw them appear rather suddenly and simultaneously, dragging it between them. The violent gesticulations of the two showed that their spirits were greatly roused, both having evidently resolved to claim and keep possession of the bale. At last one of them struck the other a severe blow on the chest, which, though it did not hurt him, caused him to stumble and fall. From his smaller size Edgar judged the striker to be Rooney. Before the other could recover, he had fastened his slings to the bale, and given the signal to hoist--intending to go up with it, but Maxwell caught him by the legs and attempted to drag him off, whereupon Rooney kicked as hard as his <b>suspended</b> <b>position</b> would admit of, and in his struggles kicked {{in one of the}} glasses of his comrade's helmet.

The paddy straw mushroom (VV) was cultivated on Se-rich paddy straw collected from seleniferous sites. Se-rich paddy straw was arranged in bundles of 40  cm length and 10  cm width (Fig.  3.2). Bundles were soaked in running water overnight. After wetting, the bundles were stacked in layers of four followed by spawning with the active culture. The spawned stacks were incubated at 35  °C till emergence of fruiting bodies. Similar protocol was followed for non-Se paddy straw.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—An {{external}} {{web service}} may evolve without prior notification. In {{the course of}} the regression testing of a workflow-based web service, existing test case prioritization techniques may only verify the latest service composition using the not-yet-executed test cases, overlooking high-priority test cases that have already been applied to the service composition before the evolution. In this paper, we propose Preemptive Regression Testing (PRT), an adaptive testing approach to addressing this challenge. Whenever a change in the coverage of any service artifact is detected, PRT recursively preempts the current session of regression test and creates a sub-session of the current test session to assure such lately identified changes in coverage by adjusting the execution priority of the test cases in the test suite. Then, the sub-session will resume the execution from the <b>suspended</b> <b>position.</b> PRT terminates only when each test case in the test suite has been executed at least once without any preemption activated in between any test case executions. The experimental result confirms that testing workflow-based web service {{in the face of such}} changes is very challenging; and one of the PRT-enriched techniques shows its potential to overcome the challenge.

40|$|The {{effects of}} being {{suspended}} motionless in an upright position is commonly termed suspension trauma. It {{has been reported}} that following rescue some patients are at risk of immediate sudden death from a cardiac arrest when they are laid flat. Although there is little evidence into the causes of this condition a number of authors have written guidelines for the care of these patients and whilst opinions differ, this quote from the UK Health and Safety Executive represents the majority view: “Important! The casuality must never be laid down after being rescued from the <b>suspended</b> <b>position,</b> not even in the recovery position. ” This advice is clear, yet it is counter to the conventional approach to trauma care and creates difficulty for transportation and subsequent care if taken literately. It is hypothesised that lying patients down results in a sudden return of pooled blood to the heart resulting in a cardiac arrest, yet this could be explained by other mechanisms which are not related to lying patients down but could result in sudden death, for example, the release of potassium resulting from ischemic areas (e. g. after femoral vessel compression by a safety harness), similar to the mechanism in crush injury. The response of the UK ambulance service as to what guidance to issue to paramedics must be measured. In order to support this decision process a systematic review was undertaken...|$|E

40|$|Background: Complex {{regional}} pain syndrome (CRPS) is {{a clinical}} entity that develops after a precipitating injury. It involves dysfunction of the sensory, autonomic, and motor systems and frequently is missed on initial presentation. The {{purpose of this}} report was to describe a simple clinical sign that can aid in its diagnosis. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of 39 consecutive patients with CRPS type I or II seen in a foot and ankle clinic between October, 2001, and May, 2005. The diagnosis was based on clinical findings. Results: Twenty-six patients had type I (67 %) and 13 patients had type II (33 %) CRPS. The most common nerve involved in type II was the superficial peroneal nerve. Each patient, while sitting on the exam table, held the affected extremity with the knee extended against gravity. When the leg was pushed back to a relaxed and <b>suspended</b> <b>position,</b> the patient eventually involuntarily resumed the extended position. This position in which the patients held their legs was termed the “kick-off” position sign. Nine patients were seen at the foot and ankle clinic within 6 weeks of the initial inciting event and had an established “kick-off ” position sign within 3 months {{from the time of}} injury. The disappearance of this sign correlated with the subsidence of pain. Conclusions: Patients with CRPS have variable clinical presentations. The awareness of this simple observation in the right clinical setting should raise the index of suspicion of CRPS in the differential diagnosis. Early treatment of this syndrome is associated with better outcome...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} is to investigate the existing photovoltaic antenna integration techniques and develop a new solar antenna integration topology in order to address the drawbacks of these techniques. With the increasing demands for low-profile antennas and a growing move towards the microgeneration of electricity, primarily by photovoltaics, photovoltaic antennas are of increasing importance with a growing amount of research in this area being developed. At present {{there are a number of}} designs for photovoltaic antennas which could be divided into two distinct categories. The first type is the use of solar cells as an RF ground plane, whilst the second type involves the use of solar cells as an RF radiating element. Both techniques bring significant challenges if they are to be widely adopted. Considering the first technique, using a solar cell as an RF ground plane introduces an optical shading problem, which significantly reduces the solar efficiency of the solar antennas using this integration topology. To this end, meshing the RF radiating element is investigated in this thesis to achieve optical transparency at the expense of increasing the cost and complexity of the fabrication process of photovoltaic antennas. Conversely, using a solar cell as an RF radiating element limits the ability to modify the resonance response using traditional RF bandwidth enhancement techniques due to the fact that solar cells need to have a homogeneous structure to achieve optimum solar performance. In order to address these challenges, a third solar antenna integration topology is proposed in this thesis. This method is based upon the use of solar cells as an RF stacked parasitic patch element suspended above the conventional RF radiating element of the integrated antennas. This integration topology enables the integrated solar cells to achieve an optimum solar efficiency due to their <b>suspended</b> <b>position</b> eliminating the shading problem. It also enables the RF radiating element to be modified to excite multiple TMmn propagation modes to achieve enhanced resonance response for multiband and wideband applications. This new topology has been further developed and applied to design a dual-polarised photovoltaic antenna for polarisation diverse communication systems, which has been extended to produce a photovoltaic array antenna for beam steering applications. This thesis addresses a major knowledge gap in the field of photovoltaic antennas. As a result of this, greater understanding of the design procedures of photovoltaic antennas and associated trade-offs from such designs is developed. Using this knowledge, novel designs that overcome the associated problems of current photovoltaic antennas are presented...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a fully contactless high precision magnetically <b>suspended</b> <b>position</b> stage with large planar stroke. This stage is the first which is suitable for practical application in vacuum. The underlying electromechanical working principles, modelling and analysis, the mechanical and electrical design, real-time control, and the experimental results of a test set-up are presented. The possibility to combine magnetic suspension and propulsion in a single actuator was proven experimentally by a PhD investigation performed by Frank Auer in the years 19901995 at the Laboratory for Micro Engineering at Delft University of Technology. Prototypes showed low cross-coupling of suspension and propulsion, and sensor-limited accuracy. In 1995, this research started as a follow-up, with the goal: improvement of the practical applicability of linear Active Magnetic Bearings (ambs) {{in the field of}} Precision Engineering. Therefore, an investigation into the state-of-the-art in ambs was performed, which revealed that, due to the high development costs, ambs can be applied best for either high end applications (e. g. linear motion stages with high precision and throughput) or for high volume consumer products (e. g. bearings for hard disk drives). These applications then profit of the general advantages of ambs, like contactless operation (no wear, no maintenance, possibly application in vacuum, absence of stick-slip), and adjustable bearing characteristics (servo position, variable stiffness and damping, active vibration isolation). Disadvantages that may limit the applicability are the limited dynamic stiffness and bearing force, with its accompanying break-through risk, and the heat development by the coils. While rotational amb actuators are mature, and have become commercially available for several years, major development effort is focused on advanced control, reliability, modularity, and cost reduction there. In contrast, linear amb actuators are still evolving. Compared to their rotational counterparts, linear systems offer only one additional degree-of-freedom, but this leads to much more freedom of the electromechanical actuator design. Since no specific application was predefined for this research, a market investigation was performed. The results were combined into the definition of a target application. When the requirements for such an application were compared to the performance delivered by the stage that was developed by Auer, {{it turned out that the}} range of the planar stroke, the positioning accuracy, the propulsion force, and the acceleration all needed to be improved, before practical application could be considered. Moreover, for application in vacuum, the development of heat should be minimized, and the power dissipation on the suspended object needs to be negligible. This can only be accomplished by a thorough re-design or a completely new principle. Based on an investigation of the principles of electromechanics, and the status and applications of electromechanical actuators in general, a number of desirable capabilities was defined at the beginning of the work described. Six possibilities are identified that appear promising for improvement. 1. Developing an integrated Lorentz drive with reluctance bearing 2. Exploiting the ongoing improvement of rare earth permanent magnets for applying them for biasing 3. Applying crossing flux-guidance bars introducing a lateral freedom of motion 4. Applying a wireless propulsion (moving iron) removing both the heat of the coils of the rotor as well as avoiding the flying umbilical wires 5. Applying high permeability coil winding material, improving the number of ampere-turns in the air gap Some of these possibilities are new, while others are known from the state-of-the-art but are new in the combined or integrated application presented. For all of them, experimental demonstrators were built to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness. The first four possibilities are combined into a novel integrated planar active magnetic motor-bearing concept, the pamb, for which a patent application was granted. The basic pamb configuration can control two to four degrees-of-freedom. Numerous, differently shaped actuators can be derived from it, that all allow for a long, principally unlimited, planar or angular stroke. The novelty lies therein that the advantages of a list of magnetic bearing and motor aspects are combined into an indivisible, integrated solution. The novel configuration integrates: * energy efficient variable reluctance type suspension, * permanent magnet biasing for fast acceleration and hence high position stability, of both bearing and motor, * extended, crossing flux guidance bars that enable motion over a long stroke, while freedom of motion is allowed for long orthogonal linear or angular strokes, * saturation of parts of the yoke, which simplifies dimensioning and fine-tuning of the permanent magnets, and ensures an optimal bias flux level, all over the long stroke, * direct Lorentz propulsion without any wires on the flat iron rotor bars, but instead with wire on the fixed stator yoke, where conduction can cool the windings, which makes the stage applicable in vacuum, * simple shaped yoke parts that are easy to produce, and * a high evolvability, meaning that the system can be scaled up to even larger strokes without changing the maximum obtainable acceleration. Based on this configuration concept, a 6 dof experimental set-up was built that demonstrated the practical feasibility. The set-up, called the pamb, shows a robust behavior of the suspension, over a full planar stroke that covers 130 mm 130 mm. The novel moving iron propulsion, with magnets and coils on the stator only, proved to work equally well as the common engineering solution with coils on the moving part. Thus, all advantages of the system by Auer are maintained, while the planar stroke has been enlarged 16 times, the dissipation during suspension is decreased from 84 W to 0. 8 mW, and the heat generation and flying wires associated with the propulsion force are taken away from the rotor. Currently, a propulsion of 0. 2 g can be reached at a total of 200 W dissipation in four propulsion coils on the stator. It should be noted that the experimental system was not optimized for a high acceleration. When, as a follow up towards practical application, a prototype is to be built, acceleration can be improved by a factor five at least through the addition of windings. In addition, by switching of coil segments, the dissipation can be decreased a factor five. Since the acceleration that can be obtained with the homopolar Lorentz force within the pamb set-up is limited, it is recommended that, to further improve the acceleration in propulsion direction, salient poles are applied instead of the flat wound propulsion coils. Although, compared to the current pamb, both motor types are stronger, they have the following drawbacks. Firstly, cogging forces are introduced, secondly costs increase, and thirdly start-up of the bearings is complicated. The advantage remains that the maximum bias flux which can be controlled by the magnetic bearings is utilized still; even employed for both functions. Based on the outcome of the experiments, it is concluded that merging two basic pamb elements leads to non-linear couplingboth mechanic as well as magnetic that complicates improvement of the sub-micron position stability as achieved with the experimental set-up realized. Therefore, an alternative actuator layout is suggested that can control four degrees-of-freedom at max, which may serve as a building block for contactless positioning systems. The work presented demonstrates the large potential in electromechanical actuator design, to achieve compact and low cost solutions for integrated motor-bearings. Since the pamb actuator concept meets the requirements set by a number of practical applications, it is recommended to start a technological research project with the aim to develop an application dedicated prototype. For this, a list of suggestions for improvement is given, of which many are combined into the alternative planar motor-bearing design mentioned above. Finally, several suggestions are given to continue this research project by a dedicated research of either the force-current relation under the influence of yoke saturation and stray flux, or of a zero intrinsic stiffness motor-bearing actuator suitable for long linear or planar stroke.
