25|$|Some {{invertebrate}} {{species that}} feature (partial) sexual reproduction {{in their native}} range are found to reproduce solely by parthenogenesis in areas {{to which they have}} been introduced. Relying solely on parthenogenetic reproduction has several advantages for an invasive species: it obviates the need for individuals in a very sparse initial population to search for mates, and an exclusively female <b>sex</b> <b>distribution</b> allows a population to multiply and invade more rapidly, potentially up to twice as fast. Examples include several aphid species and the willow sawfly, Nematus oligospilus, which is sexual in its native Holarctic habitat but parthenogenetic where it has been introduced into the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
500|$|Studies {{suggest that}} slow lorises are polygynandrous. Infants are either parked on {{branches}} while their parents find food or else are carried {{by one of}} the parents. [...] Due to their long gestations (about six months), small litter sizes, low birth weights, long weaning times (three to six months), and long gaps between births, slow loris populations have one of the slowest growth rates among mammals of similar size. Pygmy slow lorises are likely to give birth to twins—from 50% to 100% of births, depending on the study; in contrast, this phenomenon is rare (3% occurrence) in Bengal slow lorises.

40|$|A {{decline in}} {{response}} rates in traditional household surveys, combined with increased internet coverage and decreased research budgets, {{has resulted in}} increased attractiveness of web survey research designs based on purposive and voluntary opt-in sampling strategies. In the study of hidden or stigmatised behaviours, such as cannabis use, web survey methods are increasingly common. However, opt-in web surveys are often heavily criticised due to their lack of sampling frame and unknown representativeness. In this article, we outline {{the current state of}} the debate about the relevance of pursuing representativeness, the state of probability sampling methods, and the utility of non-probability, web survey methods especially for accessing hidden or minority populations. Our article has two aims: (1) to present a comprehensive description of the methodology we use at Global Drug Survey (GDS), an annual cross-sectional web survey and (2) to compare the age and <b>sex</b> <b>distributions</b> of cannabis users who voluntarily completed (a) a household survey or (b) a large web-based purposive survey (GDS), across three countries: Australia, the United States, and Switzerland. We find that within each set of country comparisons, the demographic distributions among recent cannabis users are broadly similar, demonstrating that the age and <b>sex</b> <b>distributions</b> of those who volunteer to be surveyed are not vastly different between these non-probability and probability methods. We conclude that opt-in web surveys of hard-to-reach populations are an efficient way of gaining in-depth understanding of stigmatised behaviours and are appropriate, as long as they are not used to estimate drug use prevalence of the general population...|$|R

Although recurrence rates are high, excisional therapy is the best first approach. An exception is the case in which tumor excision is either particularly dangerous or likely to result in significant physical handicap.

50|$|Lethal {{sampling}} {{is required}} to obtain age information and precise dietary composition. The age of a whale can be reliably gathered by examining the ear plug in {{the head of the}} dead animal, which accumulates as annual growth rings. Japan initially argued that simple population distribution of whale species is enough to determine the level of sustainability of the hunt and argued that certain species of whale, particularly minke whales, are in sufficient number to be hunted. The anti-whaling side countered by arguing that more accurate composition of population distribution in term of age and <b>sex</b> <b>distribution</b> is needed to determine the sustainability, which ironically provided the justification for the Japanese hunt under the scientific research exemption.

However, deputy whaling commissioner of Japan, Joji Morishita, told BBC News that the reason for the moratorium on commercial whaling was scientific uncertainty about the number of whales, and they were asked to collect more data.|$|E
