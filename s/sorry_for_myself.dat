I don't want to do that... Nobody likes a sore loser." [...] McCain said, [...] "I spent a period of time feeling <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself.</b> It's wonderful. It's one of the most enjoyable experiences that you can have. But the point is: You've got to move on ... I'm still a senator from the state of Arizona.

[...] "Perhaps ye mean it this time, and I'm {{a little}} <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> him <b>myself.</b> There are men who get sent off with bands and speeches and dinners to do a smaller thing, but Mr. Austin he just slips {{away with his}} box o' {{dynamite}} and his few sailormen." ...|$|R
5000|$|Niven later {{recalled}} the movie without affection:Bonnie Prince Charlie {{was one of}} those huge, florid extravaganzas that reek of disaster from the start. There was never a completed screenplay, and never during the eight months we were shooting were the writers more than two days ahead of the actors. In confusion we suffered three changes of directors, with Korda himself desperately taking over, and at one point I cabled Goldwyn: [...] "I have now worked every day for five months on this picture and nobody can tell me how story ends. Advise." [...] He didn't. He didn't even bother to answer. I loved Alex Korda, a brilliant, generous creature, but with this film he was wallowing in confusion. I felt <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> him, but <b>sorrier</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> as the Bonnie Prince who would assuredly bear the blame for the impending debacle.However, Niven did meet his second wife during filming.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't be silly! Can't {{you realize}} that I've grown up? And if I hadn't as much sense as Robert and Mrs. Fenwood, I'd feel very <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself.</b> But we had better be practical--I suppose you see what you ought to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{imagine it}} was largely due to absence of mind. I felt very <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> when I stood between the ties and watched the train vanish into the dark. What made it worse, {{was that of the}} joint two dollars only fifty cents was his.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry for}} you, boys," [...] he said slowly, [...] "and" [...] (diffidently) [...] "kinder <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself,</b> too. You see, I {{reckoned}} on goin' over to Skinner's to-morrow, {{to fill up}} the pork bar'l and vote for Mesick and the wagon-road. But Skinner can't let me have anything more until I've paid suthin' on account, as he calls it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ethelbertha {{wanted me}} to go to Sandgate camp and inquire for her. I was <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> the girl <b>myself,</b> but the picture of a young and innocent-looking man {{wandering}} about a complicated camp, inquiring for a lost domestic, presenting itself to my mind, I said that I'd rather not.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{desire that}} she should be treated as a relation,' said the Canon decidedly. 'There is nothing against her character,' and, as his wife was about to interrupt,--'nothing but an indiscretion to which she was almost driven many years ago. She was cruelly treated, and I for one am heartily <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> having let <b>myself</b> be guided by others.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{think it}} was about five days that {{followed}} without any change. I saw her scarce ever but at meals, {{and then of course}} in the company of James More. If we were alone even for a moment, I made it my devoir to behave the more distantly and to multiply respectful attentions, having always in my mind's eye that picture of the girl shrinking and flaming in a blush, and in my heart more pity for her than I could depict in words. I was <b>sorry</b> enough <b>for</b> <b>myself,</b> I need not dwell on that, having fallen all my length and more than all my height in a few seconds; but, indeed, I was near as <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> the girl, and sorry enough to be scarce angry with her save by fits and starts. Her plea was good: she was but a child; she had been placed in an unfair position; if she had deceived herself and me, it was no more than was to have been looked for.|$|R
60|$|I shrank then--I shrink still--from invading the {{innermost}} sanctuary of her heart, and laying it open to others, as I have laid open my own. Let it {{be enough to}} say that the time when she first surprised my secret was, I firmly believe, the time when she first surprised her own, and the time, also, when she changed towards me in the interval of one night. Her nature, too truthful to deceive others, was too noble to deceive itself. When the doubt that I had hushed asleep first laid its weary weight on her heart, the true face owned all, and said, in its own frank, simple language--I am sorry for him; I am <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am afraid}} {{she will not}} feel me much like her own mother, poor child! But {{it will not be}} for want of the will. When I look back now I feel <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> for the early loss of my mother, for though we were all merry enough as {{children}} and young people, there always {{seems to have been a}} lack of something fostering and repressing. There was a kind of desolateness in our life, though we did not understand it at the time. I am thankful you have not known it, my dears.' There was a strange rush of tears nearly choking her voice, and she shook them away with a sort of laugh. 'That I should cry for that at this time of day!' ...|$|E
6000|$|If liquor {{is worth}} drinking, {{it is worth}} taking a little trouble to come at--such trouble as a man will undergo to compass his own desires. It is not good that we should let it lie before the eyes of children, and I have been a fool in writing to the contrary. Very <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself,</b> I sought a hotel, and found in the hall a {{reporter}} who wished to know what I thought of the country. Him I lured into conversation about his own profession, and from him gained much that confirmed me in my views of the grinding tyranny of that thing which they call the Press here.

But I'm really afraid we shall be late to supper if we don't get on," [...] I broke off; though I was not {{altogether}} sorry to arrive after the porter had disposed of the baggage. I dreaded another display of active sympathy on the part of my strange companion; I have often felt <b>sorry</b> <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> the porters of hotels, but I have never thought of offering to help them handle the heavy trunks that they manage.|$|R

6000|$|Twenty-five--thirty-five--a man's in {{his prime}} then, they say--forty-five--a middle-aged man just {{entering}} politics--fifty-five--"died at the comparatively early age of fifty-five," [...] according to the newspapers. Bah! How these Christians funk death! Sixty-five--we're only getting on in years. Seventy-five is just possible, though. Great hell, cat O! fifty years more of solitary confinement in the dark! You'll die, and Beeton will die, and Torp will die, and Mai--everybody else will die, but I shall be alive and kicking with nothing to do. I'm very <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself.</b> I should like some one else to be sorry for me. Evidently I'm not going ma before I die, but the pain's just as bad as ever. Some day when you're vivisected, cat O! they'll tie you down on a little table and cut you open--but don't be afraid; they'll take precious good care that you don't die. You'll live, and you'll be very sorry then that you weren't sorry for me. Perhaps Torp will come back or... I wish I could go to Torp and the Nilghai, even though I were in their way.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{was not to}} blame. She's so {{kind and}} free with every one, I thought I had a chance. I was {{conceited}} enough {{to feel sorry for}} the other fellows, and now I can't even feel <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself.</b> I'm just dazed and hanging to the ropes. She was mighty gentle about it--you know how sunny her face is--well, she just got grave and kind o' faint-voiced, and said--Oh, you know what she said! She let me know there was another man. I didn't ask her who, and when I found out, I lost my grip entirely. At first I thought I'd resign {{and get out of the}} country; but I couldn't do it--I can't yet. The chance of seeing her--of hearing from her once in a while--she never writes except on business for her father; but--you'll laugh--I can't see her signature without a tremor." [...] He smiled, but his eyes were desperately sad. [...] "I ought to resign, because I can't do my work as well as I ought to. As I ride the trail I'm thinking of her. I sit here half the night writing imaginary letters to her. And when I see her, and she takes my hand in hers--you know what a hand she has--my mind goes blank. Oh, I'm crazy! I admit it. I didn't know such a thing could happen to me; but it has." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Sir Launcelot wist {{not what}} to do, albeit {{his heart was}} rent with love and pity. Then by and by he came close to her and he said: [...] "Lady, lady! What is this you do! May God have pity on us both, for you tear my heart strings with your grief." [...] Therewith, they two being alone, he sank down upon his knees before her, and he took her hands into his and strove to draw them away from her face. And for a while she would not let him {{withdraw}} her hands and then {{after a while she}} did let him, and so he held them imprisoned very tight in his own. Yet ever she kept her face turned away from him so that he could see but little of it. So with her face turned away she said after a while, [...] "Launcelot! Launcelot! Art thou not sorry for me?" [...] He said: [...] "Yea, lady, I am sorry for thee and I am <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself,</b> and for which of the two I am more sorry I cannot tell. For God knoweth I would abide by my duty and my faith, and mefeareth thou wouldst have me do otherwise." [...] Then the Queen said: [...] "Launcelot, what is duty and what is faith when we measure these things with the measurement of happiness and unhappiness?" [...] And Sir Launcelot said, [...] "Lady, for God's sake, forbear." ...|$|E
5000|$|Luce {{recalls her}} own {{experience}} with the chronically insecure Astaire: [...] "I actually felt more <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Fred than I did <b>for</b> <b>myself,</b> despite the horrendous schedules of rehearsals that he kept up. He was a very worried man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But for all that, Millicent," [...] Mark said, [...] "Mrs. Cunningham is right. We quite {{agree that}} there is no {{occasion}} whatever for you to go about labeled 'A good estate and over 70,000 pounds in cash,' but I do think that it is right that you should go into society. With the exception of Philip Cotter, Dick Chetwynd, and two or three other of my friends, you really know very few people. You have now gone out of mourning, and I think that Mrs. Cunningham's proposal that you should go down to Bath is a very good one. I shall not be <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> a change <b>myself,</b> <b>for</b> I have been engrossed in my work for a long time now. I can go down a day or two before you, and get you comfortable lodgings, and will myself stay at a hotel. Although I have no intimate friends beyond those from Reigate, I know a large number of men of fashion from meeting them at the boxing schools and other places, and could introduce you both, and get you into society." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Much to deplore in it {{from the}} social stand-point. And unhappily, we cannot leave the social stand-point out of our reckoning. But so far as I may speak <b>for</b> <b>myself,</b> you have done nothing to feel <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> or be ashamed of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean, Doctor, {{it would}} be foolish of other people, but I don't think it is foolish of him. Of course he could have done no good staying in the boat--he would have simply thrown away his life; and yet I think, I feel sure, that there are many men who would have thrown away their lives in such a case. Even at that moment of terror I felt a pang, when, without a word, he sprang overboard. I thought of it many times that long night, in spite of my grief for my uncle and the others, and my horror of being a {{prisoner}} {{in the hands of the}} Sepoys. I did not blame him, because I knew how he must have felt, and that it was done in a moment of panic. I was not so <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> as for him, for I knew that if he escaped, the thought of that moment would be terrible for him. I need not say that in my mind the feeling that he should not have left me so has been wiped out a thousand times by what he did afterwards, by the risk he ran for me, and the infinite service he rendered me by saving me from a fate worse than death. But I can enter into his feelings. Most men would have jumped over just as he did, and would never have blamed themselves even if they had at once started away down the country to save their own lives, much less if they had stopped to save mine as he has done.|$|E
6000|$|Arthur Berkeley {{laid the}} letter {{down with a}} quiet sigh, and folded his hands despondently before him. He hadn't seen very much of Edie, yet the {{disappointment}} was to him a very bitter one. It had been a pleasant day-dream, truly, and he was both to part with it so unexpectedly. 'Poor little Miss Butterfly,' he said to himself, tenderly and compassionately; 'poor, airy, flitting, bright-eyed little Miss Butterfly. I must give you up, must I, and Ernest Le Breton must take you for better, for worse, must he? La reyne le veult, it seems, and her word is law. I'm afraid he's hardly the man to make you happy, little lady; kind-hearted, well-meaning, but too much in earnest, too much absorbed in his ideas of right for a world where right's impossible, and {{every man for himself}} is the wretched sordid rule of existence. He will overshadow and darken your bright little life, I fear me; not intentionally--he couldn't do that--but by his Quixotic fads and fancies; good fads, honest fads, but fads wholly impracticable in this jarring universe of clashing interests, where he who would swim must keep his own head steadily above water, and he who minds his neighbour must sink like lead to the unfathomable bottom. He will sink, I doubt not, poor little Miss Butterfly; he will sink inevitably, and drag you down with him, down, down, down to immeasurable depths of poverty and despair. Oh, my poor little butterfly, I'm sorry for you, and <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>myself.</b> It was a pretty dream, and I loved it dearly. I had made you a queen in my fancy, and throned you in my heart, and now I have to dethrone you again, me miserable, and have my poor lonely heart bare and queenless!' ...|$|E

5000|$|Pickett later reflected:Perhaps {{the film}} would've done better if they'd used someone {{different}} - a Bo Derek for example. Because people {{did go to}} see Vadim's latest discovery and obviously I wasn't {{the sort of person}} they expected. The film was a disappointment, too. It {{was supposed to be a}} psychological thriller, but it wound up as a soft porn film. That wasn't Vadim's fault; he didn't have final cut. Many of my best scenes were cut out altogether. When I saw the finished version I knew it would do nothing for me. Nobody would walk away impressed. In fact, not many would even sit through the picture, which was a pity because my best work came at the end. I was <b>sorry</b> not just <b>for</b> <b>myself</b> but also <b>for</b> Vadim.
