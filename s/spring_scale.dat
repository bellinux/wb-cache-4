25|$|Nevertheless, close {{examination}} of the results shows, {{that many of them}} contradict with laws of physics, which were already known {{at the time of the}} flights. Prof. L.W. Gilbert discussed the results published by Robert in his Annalen der Physik. and showed why Robert was wrong. For example, Robert claimed, that a <b>spring</b> <b>scale</b> with attached weights showed a lower weight at altitude as compared to the ground. Such an effect is existing, but only becomes apparent at altitudes in excess of 70,000 feet (20,000 metres).|$|E
50|$|Although records {{dating to}} the 1700s refer to <b>spring</b> <b>scales</b> for {{measuring}} weight, the earliest design for such a device dates to 1770 and credits Richard Salter, an early scale-maker. <b>Spring</b> <b>scales</b> came into wide usage in the United Kingdom after 1840 when R. W. Winfield developed the candlestick scale for weighing letters and packages, required after {{the introduction of the}} Uniform Penny Post. Postal workers could work more quickly with <b>spring</b> <b>scales</b> than balance scales because they could be read instantaneously and {{did not have to be}} carefully balanced with each measurement.|$|R

25|$|In 1932, Bossi {{heard of}} an {{airplane}} which had successfully flown while powered only by a 1-horsepower (0.75kW) engine. This prompted Bossi to calculate the minimum power that a manned aircraft would need to fly. The calculation yielded a value of approximately 0.94-horsepower (0.70kW), which convinced Bossi that Human-powered flight might be possible. During a trip to Philadelphia, Bossi tested {{the speed at which}} a glider would take off under tow. The experiment consisted of hiring a professional bicyclist to tow a glider. A <b>spring</b> <b>scale</b> was attached to the tow line to sense the force exerted by the bicyclist.

500|$|A static {{equilibrium}} {{between two}} forces {{is the most}} usual way of measuring forces, using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances. For example, an object suspended on a vertical <b>spring</b> <b>scale</b> experiences {{the force of gravity}} acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the [...] "spring reaction force", which equals the object's weight. Using such tools, some quantitative force laws were discovered: that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant density (widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights); Archimedes' principle for buoyancy; Archimedes' analysis of the lever; Boyle's law for gas pressure; and Hooke's law for springs. These were all formulated and experimentally verified before Isaac Newton expounded his Three Laws of Motion.|$|E
2500|$|Weight is {{commonly}} measured {{using one of}} two methods. A <b>spring</b> <b>scale</b> or hydraulic or pneumatic scale measures local weight, the local force of gravity on the object (strictly apparent weight force). [...] Since the local force of gravity can vary by up to 0.5% at different locations, spring scales will measure slightly different weights for the same object (the same mass) at different locations. [...] To standardize weights, scales are always calibrated to read the weight an object would have at a nominal standard gravity of 9.80665m/s2 (approx. 32.174ft/s2). [...] However, this calibration is done at the factory. [...] When the scale is moved to another location on Earth, {{the force of gravity}} will be different, causing a slight error. [...] So to be highly accurate, and legal for commerce, spring scales must be re-calibrated at the location at which they will be used.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{locomotives}} were {{fitted with}} a valve controlled by a weight suspended from the end of a lever, with the steam outlet being stopped by a cone-shaped valve. As there was nothing to prevent the weighted lever from bouncing when the locomotive ran over irregularities in the track, thus wasting steam, the weight was later replaced by a more stable spring-loaded column, often supplied by Salter, a well-known <b>spring</b> <b>scale</b> manufacturer. The danger of these devices was that the driving crew could be tempted to add weight to the arm to increase pressure. Most early boilers were {{fitted with a}} tamper-proof [...] "lockup" [...] direct-loaded ball valve protected by a cowl. In the late 1850s, John Ramsbottom introduced a safety valve that became popular in Britain during {{the latter part of the}} 19th century. Not only was this valve tamper-proof, but tampering by the driver could only have the effect of easing pressure. George Richardson's safety valve was an American invention introduced in 1875, and was designed to release the steam only at the moment when the pressure attained the maximum permitted. This type of valve is in almost universal use at present. Britain's Great Western Railway was a notable exception to this rule, retaining the direct-loaded type until the end of its separate existence, because it was considered that such a valve lost less pressure between opening and closing.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spring</b> <b>scale</b> {{will only}} read {{correctly}} in {{a frame of}} reference where the acceleration in the spring axis is constant (such as on earth, where the acceleration is due to gravity). This can be shown by taking a <b>spring</b> <b>scale</b> into an elevator, where the weight measured will change as the elevator moves up and down at changing velocities.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spring</b> <b>scale</b> or {{spring balance}} or newton meter {{is a type}} of {{weighing}} scale. It consists of spring fixed at one end with a hook to attach an object at the other. It works by Hooke's Law, which states that the force needed to extend a spring is proportional to the distance that spring is extended from its rest position. Therefore, the scale markings on the spring balance are equally spaced. A <b>spring</b> <b>scale</b> can not measure mass, only weight.|$|E
50|$|As {{found by}} a new {{research}} expedition, the circumference of Gallia was 2320 km. The mass of the comet was calculated by Rosette. He determined it at 209,346 billion tonnes.

However, {{the owner of the}} scales, Isaac Hakkabut, had rigged the instrument, so the results had to be cut by a quarter.|$|R
50|$|The Earth's {{gravitational}} field is not uniform but can vary {{by as much}} as 0.5% at different locations on Earth (see Earth's gravity). These variations alter the relationship between weight and mass, and {{must be taken into account}} in high precision weight measurements that are intended to indirectly measure mass. <b>Spring</b> <b>scales,</b> which measure local weight, must be calibrated at the location at which the objects will be used to show this standard weight, to be legal for commerce.|$|R
50|$|In {{electronic}} {{versions of}} <b>spring</b> <b>scales,</b> the deflection of a beam supporting the unknown weight is measured using a strain gauge, {{which is a}} length-sensitive electrical resistance. The capacity of such devices is only limited by {{the resistance of the}} beam to deflection. The results from several supporting locations may be added electronically, so this technique is suitable for determining the weight of very heavy objects, such as trucks and rail cars, and is used in a modern weighbridge.|$|R
50|$|Spring scales {{have two}} sources of error that {{balances}} do not: the measured weight {{varies with the}} strength of the local gravitational force (by as much as 0.5% at different locations on Earth), and the elasticity of the measurement spring can vary slightly with temperature. With proper manufacturing and setup, however, spring scales can be rated as legal for commerce. To remove the temperature error, a commerce-legal <b>spring</b> <b>scale</b> must either have temperature-compensated springs or be used at a fairly constant temperature. To eliminate the effect of gravity variations, a commerce-legal <b>spring</b> <b>scale</b> must be calibrated where it is used.|$|E

50|$|Spring {{balances}} come {{in different}} sizes.

50|$|This is {{the basis}} by which masses are {{determined}} by weighing. In simple <b>spring</b> <b>scales,</b> for example, the force F {{is proportional to the}} displacement of the spring beneath the weighing pan, as per Hooke's law, and the scales are calibrated to take g into account, allowing the mass M to be read off.

50|$|One {{device for}} {{measuring}} weight or mass {{is called a}} weighing scale or, often, simply a scale. A <b>spring</b> <b>scale</b> measures force but not mass, a balance compares weight, both require a gravitational field to operate.

50|$|Weighing scales (or weigh scales or scales) are {{devices to}} measure weight or {{calculate}} mass. Spring balances or <b>spring</b> <b>scales</b> measure weight (force) by balancing the force {{due to gravity}} against the force on a spring, whereas a balance or pair of scales using a balance beam compares masses by balancing the weight due to the mass of an object against {{the weight of a}} known mass or masses. Either type can be calibrated to read in units of force such as newtons, or in units of mass such as kilograms, but the balance or pair of scales using a traditional balance beam to compare masses will read correctly for mass even if moved to a place with a different (non-zero) gravitational field strength (but would then not read correctly if calibrated in units of force), while the spring balance would read correctly in force in a different gravitational field strength (but would not read correctly if calibrated in units of mass).|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} speculated that the prophetic powers of Pythia, the woman of the Delphic Oracle, at the Temple of Apollo in Greece, were induced by {{hydrocarbon}} vapors, specifically ethylene, rising from bedrock fissures {{at the intersection of}} the E-W Delphi fault with the NNW-SSE Kerna fault, and producing neurotoxic effects, including trance and delirium. New surveys including gas flux from soil, gas in groundwater, and isotopic analyses of <b>spring</b> <b>scales,</b> provide the experimental confirmation of the gas release in the Delphi area. Presently, methane, ethane, and carbon dioxide are being released from a thermogenic (catagenetic) hydrocarbon-prone environment. This environment is not prone to biogenic production of ethylene in amounts inducing neurotoxic effects (hundreds or thousands of ppmv). A WNW-ESE–trending subsidiary fault within the Delphi fault zone, extending for 2 km, passes under the Temple of Apollo and shrine of Athena. The Temple of Apollo, located above this fault, may have been the site of enhanced degassing in the past. If gas-linked neurotoxic effects upon Pythia need to be invoked, they should be sought in the possibility of oxygen depletion due to CO 2 -CH 4 exhalation in the indoor temple.
