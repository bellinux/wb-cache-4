Specifically, we look at the interaction of prefixation and the theta role scale and the case scale in Russian and Czech. We argue that there is a correlation between the type of (crossings in) the complex scale tree, morphological marking, syntactic operations and the grammatical status <b>of</b> <b>sentences.</b> We show that only certain types of (crossings in) the complex scale tree, which correspond to certain types of syntactic processes, are allowed in the grammar. We argue that the theta role scale and the case scale belong to the syntactic structure and that they are determined by syntacticosemantic properties of the clause structure.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to investigate whether, or not, two factors, namely the type <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> frame (bizarre or common) and the image <b>of</b> the <b>sentence</b> frame (image or nonimage) determined the occurrence of a self-choice elaboration effect on incidental memory. A self-choice elaboration effect refers to the superiority of self-choice elaboration to experimenter-provided elaboration. In all experiments, the subjects performed an orienting task involving two conditions (choice and rating) followed by an unexpected free recall and cued recall tests. In the choice condition the subjects selected one sentence frame (from two) into which a specific target could fit more congruously or which, with a target, would arouse a more vivid image. In the rating condition the subjects were required to rate the congruity of each target to its sentence frame, or the vividness of the image that was aroused by each target and its sentence, on a 5 -point <b>scale.</b> Four types <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> frames were provided : bizarre image sentences; bizarre nonimage sentences; common image sentences; and common nonimage sentences. In Experiment I the image <b>of</b> the <b>sentence</b> frame {{was treated as a}} between-subjects factor and the type <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> frame was treated as a within-subjects factor, whereas in Experiment II, the type <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> frame was treated as a between-subjects factor and the image <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> frame was treated as a within-subjects factor. In Experiment I self-choice elaboration effects on free and cued recall were not observed in any <b>of</b> the <b>sentence</b> frames. However in Experiment II self-choice elaboration effects on free recall were observed in all except the common image sentence frames. Experiment II also showed that self-choice elaboration effects on cued recall were observed in nonimage sentence frames but not in image sentence frames.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether, or not, the type of orienting task (congruity and image) and the image <b>of</b> the <b>sentence</b> frame (image or nonimage) determined the occurrence of a self-choice elaboration effect on incidental memory. A self-choice elaboration effect refers to the superiority of self-choice elaboration to experimenter-provided elaboration. Two types of orienting tasks were provided: congruity task and image task. The subjects performed one of the two orienting tasks involving two conditions (choice and rating) followed by an unexpected free recall and cued recall tests. In the choice condition the subjects selected one sentence frame (from two) into which a specific target could fit more congruously or which, with a target, would arouse a more vivid image.

In the conguity task, the choice condition led to a better free recall than the rating condition in both types <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> frames, namely a self-choice elaboration effect on incidental memory did occur. Whereas in image task, the choice condition led to a better free recall than the rating condition in nonimage sentence frames, but the difference of the two conditions was not observed in image sentence frames.

The data {{are based on the}} Supreme Court’s decisions during the period of 2001 - 2009 which available in public domain in www. putusan. mahkamahagung. go. id. The data comprise of 549 cases, which involved 831 defendants. The defendants have been classified into five groups depending on their alleged <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> corruptions (i. e. petty, small, medium, large and grand <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> corruptions). The explicit cost of corruption during the period of 2001 - 2009 was Rp 73. 1 trillion (about US $ 7. 86 billion). In this paper, total financial punishment was estimated as the summation of the value of fines, seizure of assets (monetary only), and the compensation order sentenced by judges. The total financial punishment sentenced by the supreme judges during the period of 2001 - 2009 was Rp 5. 33 trillion (about US$ 573. 12 million), therefore Rp 67. 77 trillion (US$ 7. 28 billion) gap between the explicit cost of corruption and total financial punishment sentenced shall be borne by the tax payers. Logistic and Tobin’s logistic (TOBIT) regressions have been used to analyse both the likelihood and the intensity <b>of</b> <b>sentencing</b> offenders, respectively, with particular punishments (i. e. imprisonment, fines, compensation order, etc.). The results show that the probability and the intensity <b>of</b> <b>sentencing</b> across various types of punishment do not correspond to the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> corruptions.

It was found that successive F 0 maxima in the NP were subject to evidence lowering (also known as downstep). The results for the VP were more heterogeneous. Here, the occurrence of the downstep pattern was apparently blocked by two factors: the presence of an accent preceding the prosodic head of a constituent, or a deviation from the canonical order of constituents.
