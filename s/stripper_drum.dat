5000|$|Despite their name, Eagles of Death Metal {{are not a}} death metal band, and {{the name}} is {{intended}} to be humorous. In a 2003 interview, Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of [...] "bluegrass slide guitar mixed with <b>stripper</b> <b>drum</b> beats and Canned Heat vocals." [...] Hughes is known for his enthusiastic interaction with audiences at live performances. While the band were on stage at the Bataclan in Paris, France, on November 13, 2015, the audience was attacked by terrorists wielding automatic rifles, grenades and suicide vests. The death toll inside the venue was 89, including the group's merchandise manager, but the band members escaped safely out of the venue via a door backstage.|$|E

However, recently the production of a 97-round drum has started. This drum was designed to be use with the AK-107 but can also be used in any 5.45×39mm weapon with compatible magazines, such as the RPK-74 and RPK-74M. They were also testing with experimental conventional drums, a prototype 100-round belt fed drum magazine was also created. It attaches into the regular magazine well, but the cartridges are stored on a 100-round belt inside a box. A fed system removes them from the belt and puts them {{in a position where they}} can be loaded through the regular magazine well. This system is actuated by a lever from the magazine that clips around the charging handle. It is unknown if this ever went into service.|$|R
