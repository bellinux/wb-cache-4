The {{results of a}} survey of three hundred buyers find a generally high level of satisfaction with the overall experience of accommodation daily deals. The research {{contributes to the literature}} by identifying five factors, which underpin guest <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>accommodation</b> daily deals. It presents the first published research, which identifies the factors which significantly influence the level of satisfaction reported by guests for accommodation daily deals. The five factors identified are trade-offs associated with purchasing via a daily deal; the value and integrity of the deal; customer delight with the stay; hotel staff’s knowledge of the deal; and redemption challenges. With the exception of redemption challenges, all other factors are shown to have a significant influence on the guest’s overall satisfaction with their accommodation deal stay experience...|$|E

Other factors, such as nearness of the destination to the market, prior experience, sociodemographics, and additional trip characteristics, also play a role. Multiple regression analyses were used to show the factors that determine six different aspects of holiday outcome: <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> three separate <b>accommodation</b> elements (price, service, and standard), overall <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> the <b>accommodation,</b> overall <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> the holiday, and intention to return.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Survey of English Housing (SEH) was a continuous annual survey series, which began in 1993. The survey provided key housing data on tenure, owner occupation and the social rented sector, and regular information about the private rented sector. The survey was originally sponsored by the Department of the Environment, which became the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions {{in time for the}} 1996 - 1997 survey, then the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, by 2000 - 2001. Responsibility for the SEH was transferred to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister after the fieldwork for the 2002 - 2003 survey commenced, and on 5 May 2006 the series became part of the remit of the newly-established Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). The main aims of the SEH were to provide regular information about the main features of people's housing and their views about their circumstances, and information about the private rented sector (not covered by routine administrative statistics like the owner-occupied and social rented sectors). From 2008, the SEH merged with the English House Condition Survey (EHCS) to form the new English Housing Survey (EHS). The last SEH dataset is the 2007 - 2008 study. The EHS data are available at the UK Data Archive under GN 33422. Further information about the SEH and the EHS may be found on the DCLG web site Survey of English Housing and English Housing Survey web pages. Main Topics : The SEH comprises a main core of factual questions that remain largely unchanged from year to year, and cover tenure, housing costs and difficulties with mortgage/rent payments, housing history, moving intentions, and the type of home desired. The survey also carries a set of attitudinal questions which are revised/rotated each year. Nearly all of the questions asked in the 1993 / 94 survey were repeated in the 1994 - 1995 survey. Some extra questions were asked about respondents' attitudes to various aspects of their housing. Household Interview: All Households: classification section, demographic data; second homes; housing tenure; details of accommodation; sharing (if any); moves and housing history, reasons for moving; repossessions; age at which HOH left parents' home; satisfaction with present accommodation; relatives in area; public sector housing waiting lists; letting/sub-letting. Owner Occupiers: details of mortgages; cost of housing; difficulties with mortgage payments; repairs; sale of previous property; trading up and trading down. Public Sector Tenants: rents and rent arrears; receipt of housing benefit; expectations of buying; <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>accommodation</b> and landlord; satisfaction with landlord; interest in part-ownership; All Households: employment and income. Private Renters Module All Tenancy Groups: type of tenancy agreement, security of tenure; rents, changes in rent, what is included in rent; rent arrears, difficulties in paying rent; repairs and getting them done; relations with landlord; satisfaction with landlord; interest in part-ownership; satisfaction with accommodation; housing history in last 10 years; buying/moving expectations and future expectations; employment details (if head of tenancy group is not HOH), income...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{health status of}} and health risks to male Nepalese migrant {{construction}} and factory workers in the Middle East (West Asia) and Malaysia. After the more seasonal migration to India, the Middle East and Malaysia are the second most popular destinations for Nepalese workers. Differences in the health status and health risks for Nepalese workers associated {{with the type of}} work-place, demographic, socio-economic and health characteristics have been investigated in this Ph. D. This study adopted self-reported tools to measure general physical and mental health. These health risks have been measured in terms of perceived health risks and experience of work-related accidents at work. This study uses a mixed-methods approach including questionnaires and in-depth interviews with male Nepalese migrant workers, upon their return to, or prior to their departure from Nepal. Questionnaire data (n= 403) estimated the health status of migrant workers and the level of risk to which they are exposed. The interviews (n= 20) with a sub-sample of the survey population has offered detailed. Ethical approval granted by the Nepal Health Research Council. Nearly half of the respondents (46 %) were aged 20 to 29, most were married (91 %), without formal education or only had completed primary education (71 %). Most (87 %) rated their health as “very good/good or fair”. More than three quarters (79 %) perceived their work environment as “very good/good or fair”. Two-thirds (65 %) were satisfied with their accommodation abroad. The majority had semi-skilled jobs (69 %) and 71 % had registered with a doctor; 62 % had national insurance; 17 % had experienced a work accident. Overall, age was associated with self-reported poor health status as health appeared to worsen with increasing age. Perceived diet, health risks and the work environment were strongly associated with self-reported poor health status. Age, <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>accommodation,</b> work environment and country of work were strongly associated with accidents at work. Country of work and health insurance were significantly associated with not visiting a doctor abroad. The qualitative findings focus on six main themes: (a) push factors of migration; (b) pull factors; (c) living abroad; (d) working abroad; (e) health and health services; and (f) suggestions to improve health and well-being. The in-depth interviews confirmed that Nepalese migrant workers experienced accidents at work, skin problems, heart attacks, mental health issues and even death. In general, employers were perceived not to value the health of migrant workers enough and due to the pressures of work many workers took risks. A significant minority of Nepalese migrant workers working in the Middle East and Malaysia have experienced work-related risks, unsafe and stressful working and living environments and delayed medical treatment. Health and safety at work should focus on encouraging employers to provide safe work environments by giving health and safety training to ensure potential harm reduction. However, the main evidence from this study is that the majority of Nepalese male migrant workers do report a fairly positive experience e. g. with their health, health insurance and access to health services, of living and working abroad. This phenomenon coupled with the poor living and working conditions in Nepal helps explain why workers are willing to work in high risk jobs and in relatively poor working conditions abroad...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that immigrants’ approachorientation positively predicts their attitudes towards contact with host nationals. The present research builds on this previous work by investigating the extent to which immigrants’ independent vs. interdependent problem-solvingstyle moderates the relation between approach–avoidanceorientation and socialintegration. Interdependent problem-solvers rely on other people to achieve their goals. This interdependence was expected to reduce the influence of approach–avoidanceorientation on integration amongst immigrants. Immigrants to Australia (N = 137) completed a questionnaire that included measures of approach–avoidanceorientation and problem-solving style. Participants also completed three measures of socialintegration: (1) proportion of Australian friends, (2) feelings of inclusion in Australian society, and (3) <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> employment, <b>accommodation,</b> and life in Australia. Consistent with previous research, there was a positive relation between approach and socialintegration and a negative relation between avoidance and socialintegration. Consistent with predictions, problem-solvingstyle moderated the relation for approachorientation: Only immigrants who were independent problem-solvers showed a significant positive relation between approach and socialintegration. The results are discussed in relation to Gable's model of approach and avoidance social goals and motives, and the implications for immigration services are considered...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Although {{studies on}} student {{residential}} satisfaction abound, {{yet there are}} limited studies conducted on students’ satisfaction in respect of hostel accommodation facilities undertaken through public-private partnerships (PPPs) in Nigeria. The {{purpose of this study}} is to assess the level of students’ <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> the provision of university hostel accommodation facility using build-operate-transfer (BOT) model at University of Lagos (Unilag), Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach - The study adopted literature review and questionnaire survey within the case study of a BOT hostel accommodation facility at Unilag in Nigeria. The students who reside at the case study were the respondents. Hence, 153 self-administered questionnaires were purposively distributed face-to-face to the entire student population that live in the BOT hostel. Thus, a total of 96 completed questionnaires representing 63 per cent were collected and found suitable for the analysis. The data collected were analysed using the mean score and chi-square (χ 2) test. Findings - The study revealed a total mean satisfaction level of 3. 46 (on a 5 -point Likert scale), which indicates that students are “somehow satisfied” with the university hostel accommodation facility undertaken through BOT. The study further established that age and level of students have no significant influence on the overall students’ <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> their hostel <b>accommodation</b> facility undertaken through BOT. Practical implications - The study would provide valuable feedback to private investors, university authorities and facility managers of higher education institutions to improve their services in the near future. Originality/value - The identified variables that have tested to be significant in assessing students’ level of satisfaction in BOT hostel accommodation facilities could be used to assess users’ satisfaction in similar facilities delivered through PPPs in other countries...|$|R

Results: IOP significantly decreased <b>with</b> <b>accommodation</b> in both the myopic and emmetropic subjects (mean change 1. 861. 1 mm Hg, p 0. 05) between myopes and emmetropes in terms of baseline IOP or the magnitude of change in IOP <b>with</b> <b>accommodation.</b> OPA also decreased significantly <b>with</b> <b>accommodation</b> (mean change for all subjects 0. 560. 5, p< 0. 0001). The myopic subjects (baseline OPA 2. 060. 7 mm Hg) exhibited a significantly lower baseline OPA (p¼ 0. 004) than the emmetropes (baseline OPA 3. 261. 3 mm Hg),and a significantly lower magnitude of change in OPA <b>with</b> <b>accommodation.</b> Conclusion: IOP decreases significantly <b>with</b> <b>accommodation,</b> and changes similarly in progressing myopic and emmetropic subjects. However, differences found between progressing myopes and emmetropes in the mean OPA levels and the decrease in OPA associated <b>with</b> <b>accommodation</b> suggested some changes in IOP dynamics associated with myopia...|$|R

A multilayer framework of tourist satisfaction in the package tour context is proposed. Tourist satisfaction was conceptualized to include three aspects/layers: <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> guiding service, <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> tour services, and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> the overall tour experience. Tour guide performance was found to have a significant direct effect on tourist <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> guiding service and an indirect effect on <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> tour services and <b>with</b> tour experience. <b>Satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> guiding service positively affected <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> tour services but showed no direct effect on <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> the overall tour experience. However, indirect effect of <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> guiding service on <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> tour experience mediated by <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> tour services was significant.

40|$|University students’ housing has {{received}} {{a good deal of}} emphasis in previous research. Much of this early research focused on the relationship between the environment, facilities, residence hall layout and students’ satisfaction. The current study tried to view students’ housing from a different perspective. It hypothesized that when students perceive the attributes of the home in the university (which we call sense of similarity to the home) residence hall their <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> residence is improved. The current paper is {{based on the premise that}} the home is a multidimensional construct. It examined whether the residence hall is also multidimensional in the way it is described by the students. The study also aimed to understand the students’ perception of the attributes which make the residence hall similar to the home. This paper which reported the results of a pilot study on graduate female students was a qualitative study which employed an inductive approach. Eighteen (18) individual unstructured interviews were conducted with female graduate students who were living in a university residence hall March to May 2010. Twenty (20) open ended questionnaires were distributed among students of this residence hall who were not willing to be interviewed. The selected residence were occupied by graduate (both national and international) students and had single rooms with a shared bath room for each pair of rooms. Participants were, selected according to their university year, age, cultural background and nationality. The analysis carried out revealed that there were 4 major themes: Physical facilities and Comfort; Security; Privacy; and Warmth and Friendly Environment. These themes revealed the students’ perceptions of the attributes which make the residence hall comparable to the home environment. It was found that when students were asked to talk about a residence hall in terms of a home, they usually compared the present residence hall with their own home. The results also revealed that their comparisons of home and the residence hall were highly dependent on their background and previous experiences and were indicative of <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> their current <b>accommodation.</b>  </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{seeks to}} examine the effects of {{workplace}} bullying, <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> supervisor, and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> co-workers on affective commitment. Design/methodology/approach: A survey approach was used in this research. Partial least squares analyses on data from 142 full-time schoolteachers in China were used to determine whether workplace bullying, <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> supervisor, and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> co-workers have unique effects on affective commitment. Findings: The paper reveals that workplace bullying has a significant negative correlation with affective commitment while <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> supervisor and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> co-workers each have a significant positive correlation with affective commitment. Furthermore, workplace bullying, <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> supervisor, and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> co-workers all have significant unique effects on affective commitment. Research limitations/implications: Limitations are the use of self-report and cross-sectional data. Future research could adopt samples from different industries, include multi-rater data, and a longitudinal research design. Various other workplace factors that may influence affective commitment could also be examined. Practical implications: The findings highlight the need for anti-bullying policies in organisations. Neither <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> supervisor nor <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> co-workers nullifies the negative effects of bullying on the target’s affective commitment. Preventing bullying is therefore fundamental to sustaining affective commitment. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature by providing an examination of the effects of workplace bullying, <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> supervisor, and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>with</b> co-workers on affective commitment. To the authors’ knowledge, no workplace bullying research has been conducted previously in China...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{changes in}} the retinal image quality <b>with</b> <b>accommodation</b> in the human eye were studied by using a {{near-infrared}} double-pass apparatus. A slightly better modulation transfer function (MTF) in the unaccommodated eye {{with respect to the}} accommodated eye was found when using an artificial pupil with a fixed diameter. The technique allows the estimation of the MTF of the accommodated eye discounting the effect of the accommodative defocus error. Most of the reduction found in the MTF <b>with</b> <b>accommodation</b> could be explained in terms of the accommodative defocusing error. However, the shape of the retinal images clearly changes <b>with</b> <b>accommodation,</b> indicating that other aberrations are also altered <b>with</b> <b>accommodation.</b> In general, the double-pass image for the accommodated eye tends to be more symmetric than that of the unaccommodated eye. This is probably due to either a decrease in the amount of coma-like aberrations <b>with</b> <b>accommodation</b> or to an increase of other symmetric aberrations, such as defocus or spherical aberration, that hide the asymmetries present in the retinal image of the unaccommodated eye...|$|R
