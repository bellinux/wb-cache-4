50|$|The main {{taxes in}} Chile {{in terms of}} revenue {{collection}} are the value added tax (45.8% of total revenues in 2012) and the income tax (41.8% of total revenues in 2012). The value added tax is levied on sales {{of goods and services}} (including imports) at a rate of 19%, with a few exemptions. The income tax revenue comprises different taxes. While there is a corporate income tax of 20% over profits from companies (called First Category Tax), the system is ultimately designed to tax individuals. Therefore, corporate income taxes paid constitute a credit towards two personal income taxes: the Global <b>Complementary</b> <b>Tax</b> (in the case of residents) or the Additional Tax (in the case of non-residents). The Global <b>Complementary</b> <b>Tax</b> is payable by those that have different sources of income, while those receiving income solely from dependent work are subject to the Second Category Tax. Both taxes are equally progressive in statutory terms, with a top marginal rate of 40%. Income arising from corporate activity under the Global <b>Complementary</b> <b>Tax</b> only becomes payable when effectively distributed to the individual. There are also special sales taxes on alcohol and luxury goods, as well as specific taxes on tobacco and fuel. Other taxes include the inheritance tax and custom duties.|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} effect of income {{mobility}} and the persistence of redistributive tax policy {{on the level of}} redistribution in democratic societies. An infinite-horizon theoretical model is developed, and the properties of the equilibrium tax rate and the degree of after-tax inequality are characterized. Mobility and stickiness of tax policy are both negatively related to the equilibrium tax rate. However, neither is sufficient by itself. Social mobility has no effect on equilibrium taxes if tax policy is voted on in every period, and tax persistence has no effect in the absence of social mobility. The two forces are <b>complementary.</b> <b>Tax</b> persistence leads to higher levels of post-tax inequality, for any amount of mobility. The effect of mobility on inequality is less clear-cut and depends on the degree of tax persistence.

40|$|Identification of transcription-factor binding {{sites is}} a {{critical}} first step in studying transcriptional regulation of genes. The comparative genomics method of phylogenetic footprinting is based on identifying sequence elements that are conserved across multiple genomes, and, thus, likely to be functional. We have developed a systematic high throughput screening pipeline to first search for conserved motifs using two different phylogenetic footprinting methods (motifdiscovery and alignment-based), and then rapid evaluate the motifs as potential transcription-factor binding sites. The results are displayed in an interactive graphical user interface, FactorScan, which integrates three <b>separate</b> <b>complementary</b> databases (conservedsequence motifs, transcription-factor binding site motifs, TRANSFAC). We applied this pipeline for transcription-factor binding site analysis to the orthologous gene regions of prion-protein family genes from vertebrate lineages, taking account of the gene annotations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Contemporary picture {{archiving}} {{and communication}} systems {{are limited in}} managing large and varied image collections, because content-based image retrieval (CBIR) methods are unavailable. In this paper, an XML-based data and resource exchange framework is defined using open standards and software to enable specialized CBIR systems to act as geographically distributed toolkits. The approach enables communication and collaboration between two or more geographically <b>separated</b> <b>complementary</b> systems with possibly different architectures and developed on different platforms, and specialized for different image modalities and characteristics. The resulting synergy provides the user with a rich functionality operating within a familiar Web browser interface, making the combined system portable and independent of location and underlying user operating systems. We describe the coupling of the Image Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA) system and the Spine Pathology and Image Retrieval System (SPIRS) as proof of this concept. ...|$|R
40|$|Federal {{transfers}} {{can depend}} on local fiscal capacity which is measured by local tax bases. The aim {{of this paper is}} to understand to what extent and how these transfers affect local tax decisions. We develop a model with two provinces producing one mobile good. The good is taxed according to the destination principle. Final consumers decide to buy the good from the province where it is cheaper. The two provinces engage in tax competition. The introduction of scale economies into the shopping technology generates nonlinear tax reaction functions which make it possible to test the effect of a transfer equalizing local tax bases on tax competition in two <b>complementary</b> <b>tax</b> regimes. Used for this purpose are cigarette and gasoline tax data from Canada. In the case of cigarette tax it is found that nonlinearity in tax competition is almost entirely offset when equalization holds: tax competition in the two tax regimes become closer. The shopping technology for gasoline gives less scope for scale economies, so that equalization does not affect reaction functions. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} the general flow in the neocortex. The basic process, called "sequence-seeking," is a search for a sequence of mappings or transformations, linking source and target representations. The search is bi-directional, "bottom-up" as well as "top-down," and it explores in parallel a large numbe rof alternative sequences. This operation is implemented in a structure termed "counter streams," in which multiple sequences are explored along two <b>separate,</b> <b>complementary</b> pathways which seeking to meet. The first part of the paper discusses the general sequence-seeking scheme and a number of related processes, such as the learning of successful sequences, context effects, and the use of "express lines" and partial matches. The second part discusses biological implications of the model in terms of connections within and between cortical areas. The model is compared with existing data, and a number of new predictions are proposed...|$|R

We then describe how, rather than a unitary “Stop” process, {{there appear to be}} <b>separate,</b> <b>complementary</b> “Pause” and “Cancel” mechanisms. We discuss the implications of these stopping subprocesses for the interpretation of the stop-signal reaction time – in particular, some activity that seems too slow to causally contribute to stopping when assuming a single Stop processes may actually be fast enough under a Pause-then-Cancel model. Finally, we suggest that combining complementary neural mechanisms that emphasize speed or accuracy respectively may serve more generally to optimize speed-accuracy trade-offs...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} make {{sensitive}} measurements of protein–protein interaction kinetics in single neurons is critical for understanding the molecular and cellular basis of neuronal function. We have developed a reporter technology based on the differential induction of Escherichia coli TEM- 1 β-lactamase (Bla) enzymatic activity that can function as a sensor of the interaction state of two target proteins within single neurons in vivo. To modulate Bla enzymatic activity, we first split the enzyme into two <b>separate,</b> <b>complementary</b> protein fragments that we identified by using a functional screening approach based on circular permutation of the Bla enzyme. The split enzyme was then brought together by the phosphorylation-dependent association of the kinase inducible domain of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and the KIX domain of the CREB binding protein. Using an intracellular substrate whose fluorescence spectrum changes after hydrolysis by Bla, we performed time-lapse ratiometric imaging measurements of Bla enzymatic induction after association of the CREB and CREB binding protein interaction domains. This approach permits direct imaging of protein–protein interactions in single cells with high signal discrimination...|$|R

40|$|Embryonic heart cell {{aggregates}} were irradiated with {{ultraviolet light}} at wavelengths between 260 and 310 nm. Spontaneous beat rate was monitored {{with the aid}} of a closed-circuit TV camera and, in separate experiments, electrophysiological changes were assayed by intracellular recording. The characteristic response of 7 -day aggregates was an increase in spontaneous beat rate to a maximum plateau level, followed by a rather abrupt cessation of beating. Intracellular recordings during irradiation showed a marked decline in the maximum rate of rise, overshoot, and repolarization phase of the action potential, and a significant change in threshold toward zero. The action spectrum for the termination of beating peaked between 290 and 295 nm; it fell off sharply at longer wavelengths and more slowly at shorter wavelengths. The maximum increase in beat rate was increasingly greater for shorter wavelengths and exhibited no peak in the wavelength range investigated. The sensitivity of aggregates to 295 -nm light, as measured by the inverse of irradiation time required to terminate beating, decreased with increasing aggregate size and external potassium concentration, was relatively independent of temperature, and increased with embryonic age. The ultraviolet-induced increase in beat rate and termination of beating are attributed to <b>separate</b> <b>complementary</b> processes, a depolarization of the membrane, and a decline in "fast" sodium conductance...|$|R
40|$|Large {{branched}} DNA {{structures are}} constructed by two-step reassociation of <b>separated</b> <b>complementary</b> strands from restriction fragments of different lengths. The displacement of DNA strands initially annealed to longer complementary DNA sequences, a process mediated by branch migration, is very rapid and {{has thus far}} been followed only under conditions which are second order, DNA reassociation rate limiting. The average lifetime of branched DNA leading to displacement of 1. 6 Kb strands {{is estimated to be}} less than 10 seconds under conditions of DNA reassociation, Tm- 25 degrees C. Several DNA-binding drugs, including intercalating dyes, have been tested to determine their influence, if any, on the kinetics of DNA strand displacements by branch migration. Only actinomycin D was found to have significant effect under the conditions we have described. The kinetics of the strand displacement in the presence of low concentrations of actinomycin D remain second order and slower rate of strand displacement must be attributed to decreased rate of reassociation of DNA strands to form the branched intermediates. Consideration is given to the potential manipulation of DNA structures at site-directed branches and the limitations due to rapid strand displacements. The feasibility of constructing sufficiently large branched DNA regions to approach first order, branch migration rate limiting kinetics is also discussed...|$|R
