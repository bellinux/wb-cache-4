40|$|Precursors of B cells, which {{constitute}} a subpopulation of the lymphocytes in bone marrow, {{can be identified}} by their surface expression of nonimmunoglobulin markers {{and the absence of}} immunoglobulin kappa and lambda light chains. Most pre-B cells synthesize mu heavy chains but, without light-chain partners, these undergo rapid cytoplasmic degradation. In the present study, we demonstrate that late stage pre-B cells, like their neoplastic counterparts, express low levels of a surface receptor composed of mu chains paired with a <b>surrogate</b> <b>light-chain</b> <b>complex</b> formed by Vpre-B and lambda 5 -like proteins. The data define a previously suspected but unrecognized stage in normal pre-B-cell differentiation. Expression of a clonally diverse receptor renders this population of immature B-lineage cells potentially vulnerable to clonal selection by antigens and idiotypic interactions...|$|E

40|$|B-lymphocyte {{development}} involves sequential DNA rearrangements of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy (μ) {{and light}} (κ, λ) chain loci and {{is dependent on}} transient expression of μ containing pre-antigen receptor complexes (pre-BCR). To date, genetic analysis has not identified transcription factors that coordinate the pre-B-to-B transition. We demonstrate that the related interferon regulatory factors IRF- 4 (Pip) and IRF- 8 (ICSBP) are required for Ig light but not heavy-chain gene rearrangement. In the absence of these transcription factors, B-cell development is arrested at the cycling pre-B-cell stage and the mutant cells fail to down-regulate the pre-BCR. On the basis of molecular analysis, we propose that IRF- 4, 8 function as a genetic switch to down-regulate <b>surrogate</b> <b>light-chain</b> gene expression and induce conventional light-chain gene transcription and rearrangement...|$|R
40|$|Five stromal-cell-dependent {{lymphocyte}} clones {{are described}} {{that correspond to}} late pre-B or early B-cell stages of differentiation. They are useful for determining the molecular requirements for pre-B replication, for studying the stromal cells that supply those factors, and for delineating the final sequence of differentiation events as newly formed lymphocytes prepare to exit the bone marrow. The efficiency of lymphocyte growth at limiting dilution varied substantially on different stromal-cell clones and may reflect functional heterogeneity of stromal cells. Most lymphocyte clones were similar to uncloned lymphocytes from Whitlock-Witte cultures in that they responded only transiently to interleukin- 7 (IL- 7) and then died, unless maintained on a stromal-cell clone. One unusual lymphocyte clone (2 E 8) was propagated for more than 1 year in IL- 7 alone and was selectively responsive to that cytokine. Most of the lymphocyte clones were not tumorigenic in immunodeficient mice. However, one pre-B clone (1 A 9) ’grew autonomously in culture when held at high density, responded to conditioned medium {{from a number of}} cell lines, and was tumorigenic. Tumors derived from this clone were infiltrated by stromal cells and lymphocytes taken from the tumors' retained characteristics of the original clone. Ly- 6 antigens were inducible on 2 E 8 and 1 A 9 cells, but the lymphocytes were otherwise arrested in differentiation. The 2 E 8 cells had rearranged and expressed κ light-chain genes but displayed them on the surface along with surrogate light chains and μ heavy chains. Thus, expression of authentic Tight chain need not coincide with termination of <b>surrogate</b> <b>light-chain</b> utilization in newly formed B cells. Several glycoproteins have recently been demonstrated to be associated with surface immunoglobulin (Ig) on mature B-lineage cells and plasma-cell tumors. We now show that one member of this family (approximately 33 kD) was associated with the μ+surrogate <b>light-chain</b> <b>complex</b> on the 1 A 9 pre-B-cell clone. When compared to mature B lymphomas, fewer bands coprecipitated with the surface-labeled Ig isolated from pre-B- and early B-cell lines, suggesting that components of the antigen receptor are sequentially acquired during development. The normal replication and differentiation of pre-B cells is probably regulated by complex interactions with multiple cytokines and matrix components of the marrow microenvironment. Cloned lymphocyte lines that are dependent on stromal cells should continue to be important tools for molecular definition of those interactions...|$|R
40|$|The t(12; 21) translocation, which {{generates the}} TEL-AML 1 (ETV 6 -RUNX 1) fusion gene, {{is the most}} common {{structural}} chromosome change in childhood cancer and is exclusively associated with the common B cell precursor subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Evidence suggests that the translocation usually occurs in utero during fetal hemopoiesis and most probably constitutes an initiating or first-hit mutation that is necessary but insufficient for the development of overt, clinical leukemia. The mechanism by which TEL-AML 1 contributes to this early stage of leukemogenesis is unknown. To address this question we have analyzed hemopoiesis in mice syngeneically transplanted with TEL-AML 1 -transduced bone marrow stem cells. TEL-AML 1 expression was associated with an accumulation/expansion of primitive c-kit-positive multipotent progenitors and a modest increase in myeloid colony-forming cells. TEL-AML 1 expression was, however, permissive for myeloid differentiation. Analysis of B lymphopoiesis revealed an increase in early, pro-B cells but a differentiation deficit beyond that stage, resulting in reduced B cell production in the marrow. TEL-AML 1 -positive B cell progenitors exhibited reduced expression of the <b>surrogate</b> <b>light-chain</b> component λ 5 and the IL- 7 receptor, both of which may contribute to impedance of differentiation in vivo and account for their reduced in vitro clonogenicity in IL- 7. A selective differentiation deficit of B lineage progenitors (i) is consistent with the phenotype of TEL-AML 1 -associated leukemia in children and (ii) provides a potential mechanism for the protracted preleukemic state that often precedes ALL. These results provide mechanistic insight into the role of the t(12; 21) translocation in the initiation of common B cell precursor ALL...|$|R
5000|$|The {{two sources}} for cytosolic [...] in smooth muscle cells are the {{extracellular}} [...] entering through calcium channels and the [...] ions that are {{released from the}} sarcoplasmic reticulum. The elevation of cytosolic [...] results in more [...] binding to calmodulin, which then binds and activates myosin light-chain kinase. The calcium-calmodulin-myosin <b>light-chain</b> kinase <b>complex</b> phosphorylates myosin on the 20 kilodalton (kDa) myosin light chains on amino acid residue-serine 19, initiating contraction and activating the myosin ATPase. Unlike skeletal muscle cells, smooth muscle cells lack troponin, even though they contain the thin filament protein tropomyosin and other notable proteins - caldesmon and calponin. Thus, smooth muscle contractions are initiated by the -activated phosphorylation of myosin rather than [...] binding to the troponin complex that regulates myosin binding sites on actin like in skeletal and cardiac muscles.|$|R
40|$|Many {{neurohormones}} {{alter the}} force of cardiac contraction by variations in the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration. alpha 1 -Adrenergic and muscarinic stimulations, rather, modify the sensitivity of contractile proteins to Ca(2 +) -calmodulin-myosin <b>light-chain</b> kinase (MLCK) <b>complex</b> induces a large increase in Ca 2 + sensitivity (0. 14 pCa unit) of these easily accessible myofilaments. This increase is further enhanced by up to 0. 19 pCa unit when protein kinase C (PKC) is added together with MLCK. Similarly, the Ca 2 + ATPase activity of skinned cells in suspension is increased {{in the presence of}} MLCK and further in the presence of both kinases. 32 P-labelling and SDS/PAGE show that these changes are associated with light-chain 2 (LC 2) phosphorylation together with phosphorylation of troponin I and troponin T when PKC is added. Although to a smaller extent than in smooth muscle, phosphorylation of cardiac myosin LC 2 may be involved in the modulation of heart contractility...|$|R

Potent VRC 01 -like (PVL) HIV- 1 antibodies derived from the VH 1 - 2 * 02 germ-line allele target the conserved CD 4 binding site on gp 120. A bottleneck for design of immunogens capable of eliciting PVL antibodies is that VH 1 - 2 * 02 germ-line BCR interactions with gp 120 are uncharacterized. Here, we report {{the structure of a}} VH 1 - 2 * 02 germ-line antibody alone and a germ-line heavy-chain/mature <b>light-chain</b> chimeric antibody <b>complexed</b> with HIV- 1 gp 120. VH 1 - 2 * 02 residues make extensive contacts with the gp 120 outer domain, including all PVL signature and CD 4 mimicry interactions, but not critical CDRH 3 contacts with the gp 120 inner domain and bridging sheet that are responsible for the improved potency of NIH 45 - 46 over closely related clonal variants, such as VRC 01. Our results provide insight into initial recognition of HIV- 1 by VH 1 - 2 * 02 germ-line BCRs and may facilitate the design of immunogens tailored to engage and stimulate broad and potent CD 4 binding site antibodies...|$|R
40|$|In plasma, {{antihemophilic factor}} (factor VIII) exists as a 200 -kilodalton heavy-chain {{polypeptide}} {{in a metal}} ion association with an 80 -kilodalton <b>light-chain</b> polypeptide. This <b>complex</b> is bound by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions to a large multimeric glycoprotein, von Willebrand factor (vWF). Accumulation of secreted human factor VIII activity expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells requires the addition of serum in the growth medium, which provides vWF. Here we report that coexpression of vWF with factor VIII in Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in increased stable accumulation of factor VIII activity {{in the absence of}} serum in the growth medium. In the coexpressing cells, the vWF cDNA transcription unit was transcribed to yield mRNA which was efficiently translated. vWF was properly processed and secreted to yield disulfide-bonded high-molecular-weight multimers similar to those observed in vWF secreted from human endothelial cells. Nuclear run-on assays showed that the factor VIII gene was transcribed at a level {{similar to that of the}} vWF gene, but the mRNA did not accumulate to high levels in the cytoplasm. In addition, although the translation efficiency of the factor VIII mRNA was similar to that of vWF, the processing and secretion of the factor VIII primary translation product was dramatically reduced compared with vWF. These results demonstrate that in Chinese hamster ovary cells both factor VIII mRNA accumulation and the processing and secretion of the primary factor VIII translation product are inefficient processes...|$|R
