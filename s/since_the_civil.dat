5|$|Another {{contentious}} financial {{issue at}} the time was the protective tariff. While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Butler {{violated}} diplomatic norms by publicly recounting {{gossip about}} Benito Mussolini {{in which the}} dictator allegedly struck and killed a child with his speeding automobile in a hit-and-run accident. The Italian government protested and President Hoover, who strongly disliked Butler, forced Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams III to court-martial him. Butler became the first general officer to be placed under arrest <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War. He apologized to Secretary Adams and the court-martial was canceled with only a reprimand.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl dealt {{a double}} {{blow to the}} state's economy, which had {{significantly}} improved <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War. Migrants abandoned the worst hit sections of Texas during the Dust Bowl years. Especially from this period on, blacks left Texas in the Great Migration to get work in the Northern United States or California and to escape the oppression of segregation. In 1940, Texas was 74 percent Anglo, 14.4 percent black, and 11.5 percent Hispanic.|$|E
5|$|The United States has {{operated}} under a two-party system {{for most of}} its history. For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.|$|E
5|$|The saloon keepers, who {{received}} word that Hobbs {{was accompanied by}} law enforcement officers only shortly before her arrival, greeted her by dressing up the town with bunting, blue and pink ribbons, and flowers. A town meeting was arranged at 2:30 p.m. on January 3. Hobbs renewed the call for the resignation of city officials, but the request was refused. Hobbs' escorts then arrested the city leaders and ordered Lawson to declare martial law. It {{was the first time}} in Oregon <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War that martial law was put into effect.|$|E

5|$|His {{time in the}} Senate allowed Blaine {{to develop}} his foreign policy ideas. He {{advocated}} expansion of the American navy and merchant marine, which had been in decline <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War. Blaine also bitterly opposed {{the results of the}} arbitration with Great Britain over American fishermen’s right to fish in Canadian waters, which resulted in a $5.5 million award to Britain. Blaine’s Anglophobia combined with his support of high tariffs. He had initially opposed a reciprocity treaty with Canada that would have reduced tariffs between the two nations, {{but by the end of}} his time in the Senate, he had changed his mind, believing that Americans had more to gain by increasing exports than they would lose by the risk of cheap imports.|$|E
5|$|Sherman and Hayes {{agreed to}} {{stockpile}} gold {{in preparation for}} the exchange of greenbacks for specie. The Act remained unpopular in some quarters, leading to four attempts to repeal it in the Senate and fourteen in the House—all unsuccessful. By this time, public confidence in the Treasury had grown to the extent that a dollar in gold was worth only $1.05 in greenbacks. Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for gold, few actually did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were redeemed. Greenbacks were now at parity with gold dollars, and the nation had, for the first time <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, a unified monetary system.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{replaced}} Richardson as Treasury Secretary with Benjamin H. Bristow, a {{man known}} for his honesty, who {{began a series of}} reforms in the department. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, whiskey distillers and corrupt treasury agents falsified figures on the amount of liquor produced, while certifying bogus returns, denying the treasury of revenue. Discovering that millions of gallons of whiskey escaped taxation, and having Grant's endorsement to act ("Let no guilty man escape"), Bristow in May 1875 struck at the Whiskey Ring. He ordered federal marshals to seize 32 installations and arrest 350 men; Bristow obtained 176 indictments that led to 110 convictions, and giving $3,150,000 to the Treasury. Bristow's investigation implicated Babcock and Missouri treasury agent John McDonald as part of the Whiskey Ring. When informed on separate occasions, Grant became defensive concerning Babcock, but concerning McDonald, the ringleader, Grant believed he had been betrayed. In 1876, a jury acquitted Babcock at a trial influenced by Grant's deposition in Babcock's favor. After the trial, Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House. Grant freed some Ring members after a few months in prison, including McDonald, released after serving 17 months in jail.|$|E

5|$|Randall {{stood against}} this measure, {{as he had}} against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of {{consensus}} delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session beginning in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority {{for the first time}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Cleveland's {{return to}} office, hard times struck {{the nation with}} the Panic of 1893. A {{businessman}} in Youngstown, Robert Walker, had lent money to McKinley in their younger days; in gratitude, McKinley had often guaranteed Walker's borrowings for his business. The governor had never kept track {{of what he was}} signing; he believed Walker a sound businessman. In fact, Walker had deceived McKinley, telling him that new notes were actually renewals of matured ones. Walker was ruined by the recession; McKinley was called upon for repayment in February 1893. The total owed was over $100,000 and a despairing McKinley initially proposed to resign as governor and earn the money as an attorney. Instead, McKinley's wealthy supporters, including Hanna and Chicago publisher H. H. Kohlsaat, became trustees of a fund from which the notes would be paid. Both William and Ida McKinley placed their property {{in the hands of the}} fund's trustees (who included Hanna and Kohlsaat), and the supporters raised and contributed a substantial sum of money. All of the couple's property was returned to them by the end of 1893, and when McKinley, who had promised eventual repayment, asked for the list of contributors, it was refused him. Many people who had suffered in the hard times sympathized with McKinley, whose popularity grew. He was easily re-elected in November 1893, receiving the largest percentage of the vote of any Ohio governor <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War.|$|E
