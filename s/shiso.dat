25|$|In Makidani, Yamasaki, <b>Shisō</b> District, Harima Province (now within <b>Shisō,</b> Hyōgo Prefecture), a tale {{was passed}} down {{about a person}} in Karakawa who was a bakeneko. The same kind of tale was also found in Taniguchi, Fukusaki village, Jinsai District, of the same province, where {{it is said that}} in Kongōjō-ji, a bakeneko who troubled a {{villager}} was killed by someone from the temple. This bakeneko was protected from arrows and bullets by a chagamas lid and an iron pot. These, like the legend of Susanoo's extermination of Yamata no Orochi, have a commonality in that the local old families of the area played a role.|$|E
25|$|As {{a country}} that had much to gain by eclipsing Chinese power in East Asia, Japan in more recent times has perhaps been most ardent in {{identifying}} and demolishing what it dismissively calls Chūka <b>shisō</b> (中華思想), loosely meaning 'Zhonghua ideology'. One manifestation of Japanese resistance to Sinocentrism was the insistence {{for many years in}} the early 20th century on using the name Shina (支那) for China, based on the Western word 'China', in preference to Chūgoku (中国 Central Country) advocated by the Chinese themselves.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{main dish}} has been cooked, spices such as minced ginger and various pungent herbs may be added as a garnish, called tsuma. With certain milder items, {{a dollop of}} wasabi and grated daikon (daikon-oroshi), or Japanese mustard are {{provided}} as condiments. A sprig of mitsuba {{or a piece of}} yuzu rind floated on soups are called ukimi. Minced <b>shiso</b> leaves and myoga often serve as yakumi, a type of condiment paired with tataki of katsuo or soba. Finally, a dish may be garnished with minced seaweed in the form of crumpled nori or flakes of aonori. Shichimi is also a very popular spice mixture often added to soups, noodles and rice cakes, Shichimi is a chilli based spice mix which containing 7 spices: chilli, sansho, orange peel, black sesame, white sesame, hemp, ginger, and nori.|$|E
500|$|In some languages, {{including}} old Chinese, Thai, old Japanese, and Vietnamese, {{the same}} word can mean either blue or green. The Chinese character [...] (pronounced qīng in Mandarin, ao in Japanese, and [...] in Sino-Vietnamese) has a meaning that covers both blue and green; blue and green are traditionally considered shades of [...] "". In more contemporary terms, they are [...] (lán, in Mandarin) and [...] (lǜ, in Mandarin) respectively. Japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green, [...] (midori, which {{is derived from the}} classical Japanese descriptive verb midoru [...] "to be in leaf, to flourish" [...] in reference to trees) and グリーン (guriin, which is derived from the English word [...] "green"). However, in Japan, although the traffic lights have the same colors as other countries have, the green light is described using {{the same word}} as for blue, aoi, because green is considered a shade of aoi; similarly, green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples, green <b>shiso</b> (as opposed to red apples and red <b>shiso)</b> will be described with the word aoi. Vietnamese uses a single word for both blue and green, , with variants such as xanh da trời (azure, lit. [...] "sky blue"), lam (blue), and lục (green; also xanh lá cây, lit. [...] "leaf green").|$|E

2500|$|Umeboshi (...) are pickled {{and dried}} plums. They are a Japanese specialty. Pickled with coarse salt, {{they are quite}} salty and sour, and {{therefore}} eaten sparingly. They are often red in colour when purple <b>shiso</b> leaves are used. [...] Plums used for making umeboshi are harvested in late May or early June, while they are still green, and layered with salt. [...] They are weighed down with a heavy stone (or some more modern implement) until late August. [...] They are then dried in the sun on bamboo mats for several days (they are returned to the salt at night). The flavonoid pigment in <b>shiso</b> leaves gives them their distinctive colour and a richer flavour. Umeboshi are generally eaten with rice {{as part of a}} bento (boxed lunch), although they may also be used in makizushi (rolled sushi). Umeboshi are also used as a popular filling for rice balls (onigiri) wrapped in laver. Makizushi made with plums may be made with either umeboshi or bainiku (umeboshi paste), often in conjunction with green <b>shiso</b> leaves. A byproduct of umeboshi production is umeboshi vinegar, a salty, sour condiment.|$|E
2500|$|Cise or cisey (houses) in a kotan {{were made}} of cogon grasses, bamboo grass, barks, etc. The length lay east to west or {{parallel}} to a river. A house was about seven meters by five with an entrance at the west end that {{also served as a}} storeroom. The house had three windows, including the [...] "rorun-puyar," [...] a window located on the side facing the entrance (at the east side), through which gods entered and left and ceremonial tools were taken in and out. The Ainu have regarded this window as sacred and have been told never to look in through it. A house had a fireplace near the entrance. The husband and wife sat on the fireplace's left side (called <b>shiso)</b> [...] Children and guests sat facing them on the fireplace's right side (called harkiso). The house had a platform for valuables called iyoykir behind the <b>shiso.</b> The Ainu placed sintoko (hokai) and ikayop (quivers) there.|$|E
2500|$|Cooked bits of tempura {{are either}} eaten with dipping sauce, salted without sauce, or used to {{assemble}} other dishes. Tempura is commonly served with grated daikon and eaten hot immediately after frying. In Japan, {{it is often}} found in bowls of soba or udon soup often {{in the form of}} a shrimp, <b>shiso</b> leaf, or fritter. [...] The most common sauce is tentsuyu sauce (roughly three parts dashi, one part mirin, and one part shoyu). Alternatively, tempura may be sprinkled with sea salt before eating. Mixtures of powdered green tea and salt or yuzu and salt are also used.|$|E
