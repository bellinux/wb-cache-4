500|$|When the {{campaign}} ran low on adult volunteers, James Bevel, SCLC's Director of Direct Action, {{thought of the}} idea of having <b>students</b> <b>become</b> the main demonstrators in the Birmingham campaign.

This resulted in over a thousand arrests, and, as the jails and holding areas filled with arrested students, the Birmingham Police Department, led by Eugene [...] "Bull" [...] Connor, used high-pressure water hoses and police attack dogs on the children and adult bystanders. Not all of the bystanders were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of SCLC to hold a completely nonviolent walk, but the students held to the nonviolent premise. King and the SCLC drew both criticism and praise for allowing children to participate and put themselves in harm's way.|$|E

2500|$|Although self-verification strivings tend to {{stabilize}} people's self-views, changes in self-views may still occur.
