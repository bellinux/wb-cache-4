5000|$|... 1 July: Lawrence O'Donnell, <b>senior</b> MSNBC <b>political</b> <b>analyst</b> on The McLaughlin Group, stated: [...] "And I know I'm {{going to}} get pulled into the grand jury for saying this but the source of...for Matt Cooper was Karl Rove, {{and that will be}} {{revealed}} in this document dump that Time magazine's {{going to do with the}} grand jury." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{monologue}} {{segment is}} often {{followed by a}} segment featuring an exchange with a correspondent—typically introduced as the show's [...] "senior" [...] specialist in the subject at hand—either at the anchor desk with the host or reporting from a false location {{in front of a}} greenscreen showing stock footage. Their stated areas of expertise vary depending on the news story that is being discussed, and can range from relatively general (such as <b>Senior</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Analyst)</b> to absurdly specific (such as Senior Religious Registry Correspondent). The cast of correspondents is quite diverse, and many often sarcastically portray extreme stereotypes of themselves to poke fun at a news story, such as [...] "Senior Latino Correspondent", [...] "Senior Youth Correspondent" [...] or [...] "Senior Black Correspondent". They typically present absurd or humorously exaggerated takes on current events against the host's straight man.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013, Axelrod {{established}} a bipartisan Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago, where {{he serves as}} director. On 23 January 2013, La Stampa reported that Axelrod was helping Italian prime minister Mario Monti with his election campaign and had flown to Italy to meet with Monti ten days earlier.

On February 19, 2013, Axelrod joined NBC News and MSNBC as a <b>senior</b> <b>political</b> <b>analyst,</b> a position he held until September 2015 when he moved to CNN.|$|E
2500|$|While the Clinton {{campaign}} chose {{a strategy}} that emphasized experience, Axelrod helped to craft the Obama campaign's main theme of [...] "change." [...] Axelrod criticized the Clinton campaign's positioning by saying that [...] "being the consummate Washington insider is not {{where you want to}} be in a year when people want change... initial strategic positioning was wrong and kind of played into our hands." [...] The change message played a factor in Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses. [...] "Just over half of [...] Democratic caucus-goers said change was the No. 1 factor they were looking for in a candidate, and 51 percent of those voters chose Barack Obama," [...] said CNN <b>senior</b> <b>political</b> <b>analyst</b> Bill Schneider. [...] "That compares to only 19 percent of 'change' caucus-goers who preferred Clinton." [...] Axelrod also believed that the Clinton campaign underestimated the importance of the caucus states. [...] "For all the talent and the money they had over there," [...] says Axelrod, [...] "they—bewilderingly—seemed to have little understanding for the caucuses and how important they would become." [...] In the 2008 primary season, Obama won a majority of the states that use the caucus format.|$|E
