50|$|Someone aged {{at least}} 16 years and 9 months may receive a Type B driver's licence. After {{receiving}} both a medical and eye checkup, an applicant {{can take a}} 30 question multiple-choice test, of which they must answer at least 26 correctly. Before taking the actual <b>driving</b> <b>test,</b> they must receive at least 28 lessons at a certified driving school. After passing the internal <b>driving</b> school <b>test,</b> the instructor will arrange the road test, which will be taken in the driving school's vehicle. If someone fails either the written or <b>driving</b> <b>test,</b> they must wait {{at least two weeks}} before retaking the <b>driving</b> <b>test,</b> and one day before retaking the written <b>test.</b> Once the <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> has been passed, the licensing authority will issue a temporary licence together with a payment voucher.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Driving is {{a complex}} form of {{activity}} involving especially cognitive and psychomotor functions. These functions may be impaired by Parkinson's disease. The relation between Parkinson's disease and driving ability is still obscure and clinicians {{have to make decisions}} concerning the driving ability of their patients based on insufficent information. Until now no studies have compared different methods for evaluating the driving ability of patients with Parkinson's disease.  METHODS—The driving ability of 20 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 20 age and sex matched healthy control subjects was evaluated by a neurologist, psychologist, vocational rehabilitation counsellor, and driving instructor using a standard 10 point scale. The patients and controls also evaluated their own driving ability. Cognitive and psychomotor laboratory tests and a structured on road <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> were used for evaluating the subjects' driving ability.  RESULTS—The patients with Parkinson's disease performed worse than the controls both in the laboratory tests and in the <b>driving</b> <b>test.</b> There was a high correlation between the laboratory <b>tests</b> and <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> both in the patient group and in the control group. Disease indices were not associated with the <b>driving</b> <b>test.</b> The neurologist overestimated the ability of patients with Parkinson's disease to drive compared with the driving ability evaluated by the structured on road <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> and with the <b>driving</b> related laboratory <b>tests.</b> Patients themselves were not capable of evaluating their own ability reliably.  CONCLUSION—Driving ability is greatly decreased in patients with even mild to moderate Parkinson's disease. The evaluation of patients' driving ability is very difficult to carry out without psychological and psychomotor <b>tests</b> and/or a <b>driving</b> <b>test.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In the British {{practical}} <b>driving</b> <b>test,</b> {{serious or}} dangerous faults are those judged to involve potential or actual danger, {{and a single}} such fault results in test failure. As part of a wider project to review the <b>driving</b> <b>test,</b> TRL conducted a study of test-retest reliability. Test and retest outcomes differed for a substantial proportion of candidates. The paper argues that inconsistent performance {{on the part of}} the candidate is likely to explain much of this apparent unreliability. Faults that are less serious are also recorded during the test but few candidates make the 16 of them necessary to fail. Self-reported accidents during the first six months of post-test driving were analysed together with <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> records for approximately 30, 000 drivers. Statistical modelling suggested that people who pass the <b>driving</b> <b>test</b> having made large numbers of the less serious faults may be intrinsically less safe as drivers, but that they also tend to drive less overall, and less often at night. This reduces (and for men removes) the association between test faults and the actual number of accidents reported...|$|R
