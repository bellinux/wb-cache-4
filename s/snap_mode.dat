40|$|Rock {{fractures}} play {{an important}} role in flow and contaminant transport in fractured aquifers, production of oil from petroleum reservoirs, and steam generation from geothermal reservoirs. In this dissertation, phenomenological aspects of flow in unsaturated fractures were studied in visualization experiments conducted on a transparent replica of a natural, rough-walled rock fracture for inlet conditions of constant pressure and flow rate over a range of angles of inclination. The experiments demonstrated that infiltrating liquid proceeds through unsaturated rock fractures along non-uniform, localized preferential flow paths. Even in the presence of constant boundary conditions, intermittent flow was a persistent flow feature observed, where portions of the flow channel underwent cycles of snapping and reforming. Two modes of intermittent flow were observed, the pulsating blob mode and the rivulet <b>snapping</b> <b>mode.</b> A conceptual model for the rivulet <b>snapping</b> <b>mode</b> was proposed and examined using idealized, variable-aperture fractures. The frequency of intermittent flow events was measured in several experiments and related to the capillary and Bond numbers to characterize this flow behavior...|$|R

40|$|Although the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) can be {{considered}} {{as one of the most}} extensively investigated carnivorous plants, knowledge is still scarce about diversity of the snap-trap motion, the functionality of snap traps under varying environmental conditions, and their opening motion. By conducting simple snap-trap closure experiments in air and under water, we present striking evidence that adult Dionaea snaps similarly fast in aerial and submersed states and, hence, is potentially able to gain nutrients from fast aquatic prey during seasonal inundation. We reveal three <b>snapping</b> <b>modes</b> of adult traps, all incorporating snap buckling, and show that millimeter-sized, much slower seedling traps do not yet incorporate such elastic instabilities. Moreover, opening kinematics of young and adult Dionaea snap traps reveal that reverse snap buckling is not performed, corroborating the assumption that growth takes place on certain trap lobe regions. Our findings are discussed in an evolutionary, biomechanical, functional–morphological and biomimetic context...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVarious {{static and}} dynamic aspects of post-buckled thin plates, {{including}} {{the transition of}} buckled patterns, post-buckling dynamics, secondary bifurcation, and dynamic <b>snapping</b> (<b>mode</b> jumping phenomenon), are investigated systematically using asymptotical and non-stationary finite element methods. In part I, the secondary dynamic instability and the local post-secondary buckling behavior of thin rectangular plates under generalized (mechanical and thermal) loading is investigated using an asymptotic numerical method which combines Koiter’s nonlinear instability theory with the finite element technique. A dynamic multi-mode reduction method—similar to its static single-mode counterpart: Liapunov–Schmidt reduction—is developed in this perturbation approach. Post-secondary buckling equilibrium branches are obtained by solving the reduced low-dimensional parametric equations and their stability properties are determined directly by checking the eigenvalues of the resulting Jacobian matrix. Typical post-secondary buckling forms—transcritical, supercritical and subcritical bifurcations are observed according to different combinations of boundary conditions and load types. Geometric imperfection analysis shows that not only the secondary bifurcation load but also changes in the fundamental post-secondary buckling behavior are affected. The post-buckling dynamics and the global analysis of mode jumping of the plates are addressed in part II...|$|R

40|$|For {{the last}} decade Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) {{demonstrated}} his huge capabilities in many applications. In particular, it provides the refocusing of objects recorded out of focus and the quantitative phase contrast imaging. We implemented several types of DHM using optical sources of reduced coherence that largely improve the image quality by removing the coherent artifact noise. Different microscope implementations are described up to a color version with LED illumination allowing to record color holograms in <b>snap</b> shot <b>mode.</b> With respect to classical microscopy, DHM provides an enlarged amount {{of information on the}} sample under test that can be exploited to implement powerful processing as automated 3 D detection and automated holographic classification. The developed automated processes have been applied to life sciences applications, as the water monitoring for environmental analysis and the dynamical behavior of red blood cells.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new {{application of the}} snapdrift algorithm [1]: feature discovery and clustering of speech waveforms from nonstammering and stammering speakers. The learning algorithm is an unsupervised version of snapdrift which employs the complementary concepts of fast, minimalist learning (snap) & slow drift (towards the input pattern) learning. The SnapDrift Neural Network (SDNN) is toggled between <b>snap</b> and drift <b>modes</b> on successive epochs. The speech waveforms are drawn from a phonetically annotated corpus, which facilitates phonetic interpretation of the classes of patterns discovered by the SDNN...|$|R
40|$|One {{way that}} {{software}} transactional memory implementations {{attempt to reduce}} synchronization conflicts among transactions is by supporting different kinds of access modes. One such implementation, Dynamic Software Transactional Memory (DSTM), supports three kinds of memory access: WRITE access, which allows an object to be observed and modified, READ access, which allows an object to be observed but not modified, and RELEASE access, which allows an object to be observed for a limited duration. In this paper, we examine the relative performance of these modes for simple benchmarks on a small-scale multiprocessor. We find that on this platform and for these benchmarks, the READ and RELEASE access benchmarks do not substantially increase transaction throughput (and sometimes reduce it). We blame the extra bookkeeping inherent in these access modes. In response, we propose a new <b>SNAP</b> access <b>mode.</b> This mode provides almost the same behavior as RELEASE mode, but admits much more efficient implementations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} the snap-drift modal learning algorithm developed {{in recent years by}} Lee and Palmer-Brown (Lee, 2004 a). The application involves phrase recognition using a set of phrases from the Lancaster Parsed Corpus (LPC) (Garside, 1987). The learning algorithm is the classifier version of snap-drift. The twin modes of minimalist learning (snap) and slow drift towards the input pattern are applied alternately. Each neuron of the Snap-Drift Neural Network (SDNN) swaps between <b>snap</b> and drift <b>modes</b> when declining performance is indicated on that particular node, so that each node has its learning mode toggled independently of the other nodes. Learning on each node is also reinforced by enabling learning with a probability that decreases with increasing performance. The simulations demonstrate that learning is stable, and the results have consistently shown similar classification performance and advantages in terms of speed in comparison with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and back-propagation neural networks applied to the same problem...|$|R
40|$|Micro-scale, {{whispering}} gallery mode (WGM) resonators {{are important}} devices for trapping, slowing down, and intensifying light in opto-electronic applications. Of the many available silica-based devices, surface nanoscale axial photonics (SNAP) resonators are {{a new generation of}} WGM microresonators, consisting of an optical fiber with nanoscale variations of its effective radius. They have received great attention owing to their advantages over conventional silica-based devices, such as flexibility and ultra-low losses, which lead to ultra-high quality factors. They have demonstrated great potential as photonic micro-devices in switching, slowing light, filtering, lasing, and sensing with high precision, as well as for research on Anderson localization and tunnelling. In this thesis, we present a new fabrication method for SNAP devices using a regular hydrogen-oxygen torch, requiring less equipment than current techniques. We have characterized our SNAP devices with evanescent spectroscopy, utilizing a tapered optical fiber as an excitation source. The transmission spectroscopy results show that our flame fabricated <b>SNAP</b> devices have <b>modes</b> with very high quality factors (10 ^ 7) which can show significant thermal non-linear effects...|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{result is}} {{presented}} on chaotic oscillations of a buckled beam under an axial spring. The beam with a concentrated mass is clamped at both ends. The beam is compressed to the post-buckled configuration by the axial spring. The beam {{is subjected to}} periodic lateral acceleration. Introducing a mode shape function to a basic equation, nonlinear ordinary differential equations of multiple-degree-of-freedom system is reduced to by the Galerkin procedure. Changing a stiffness of the axial spring, an internal resonance condition of one to two is selected. First, steady-state resonance responses are calculated by the harmonic balance method. The chaotic responses are obtained by a numerical integration. The chaotic responses are examined by the Poincare projection, the maximum Lyapunov exponent and bifurcation diagrams. The chaos due to the internal resonance is easily generated by a small amplitude of excitation. As the exciting frequency decreased, transition to the chaos from a periodic response needs larger amplitude of excitation. In a lower range of frequency, the chaotic oscillations are mixed with the internal resonance and the dynamic <b>snap</b> buckling. Two <b>modes</b> of vibration contribute to the chaos related to the internal resonance. Number of the modes increases more than three for the chaos involved the dynamic snap buckling...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{peripheral}} chemoreceptor sensitivity is enhanced in both clinical and experimental heart failure (HF) and that impairment of nitric oxide (NO) production contributes to this enhancement. In order to understand the cellular mechanisms associated with the alterations of chemoreceptor function and the actions of NO in the carotid body (CB), we compared the outward K+ currents (IK) of glomus cells in sham rabbits with that in HF rabbits and monitored the effects of NO on these currents. Ik was measured in glomus cells using conventional and perforated whole-cell configurations. IK was attenuated in glomus cells of HF rabbits, and their resting membrane potentials (− 34. 7 ± 1. 0 mV) were depolarized as compared with those in sham rabbits (− 47. 2 ± 1. 9 mV). The selective Ca 2 +-dependent K+ channel (KCa) blocker iberiotoxin (IbTx, 100 nm) reduced IK in glomus cells from sham rabbits, but had no effect on IK from HF rabbits. In perforated whole-cell mode, the NO donor SNAP (100 μm) increased IK in glomus cells from HF rabbits {{to a greater extent than}} that in sham rabbits (P < 0. 01), and IbTx inhibited the effects of SNAP. However, in conventional whole-cell <b>mode,</b> <b>SNAP</b> had no effect. Nω-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, NO synthase inhibitor) decreased Ik in sham rabbits but not in HF rabbits. The guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazole[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ) inhibited the effect of SNAP on Ik. These results demonstrate that IK is reduced in CB glomus cells from HF rabbits. This effect is due mainly to the suppression of KCa channel activity caused by decreased availability of NO. In addition, intracellular cGMP is necessary for the KCa channel modulation by NO...|$|R
5000|$|Wesley {{shows up}} at the spa and helps Angel by {{translating}} the Kungai's last words, which identify Barney as his murderer. At Angel's place, Barney permanently dispenses with his mild-mannered persona and starts to terrorize Cordelia. Physically overmatched by Barney's demon strength, Cordelia is unable to prevent him from tying her wrists behind her. Still, she fights back by pretending to get a vision and, in the demon's moment of distraction, kicks him squarely between the legs. Originally wishing to empathically savor Cordelia's fear, Barney has worked her into such a frenzied state that she now refuses to leave quietly. With mild regret for damaging merchandise (and with maybe a tinge of vengefulness), Barney knocks Cordelia unconscious with a punch to the jaw and takes her from the building. Returning to the empty apartment, Angel and Wesley both feel responsible for Cordelia's fate. As Angel hunts for clues, Wesley collapses in despair over losing yet another young woman from his care. [...] "I'm a fraud," [...] he tells Angel. [...] "The Council was right to sack me." [...] Angel, initially annoyed, now listens with more patience, even as he continues to comb the place for evidence. When Angel finds the crumpled drawing Cordelia made from her vision, he rotates the paper ninety degrees and recognizes it as the gray, blobby sculpture, [...] "Maiden with Urn," [...] by an artist with whom he's familiar. Finally getting a clue, he and Wesley both <b>snap</b> into research <b>mode.</b> Angel queries the web and finds that the sculpture is currently owned by a hotel chain with many establishments in the L.A. area. Wesley, having looked up the one Kungai phrase he hadn't been able to translate, finally figures out that [...] "caller sale" [...] means [...] "auction." [...] This gives the guys the last piece of the puzzle and, taking only moments to arm themselves, they race to Cordy's rescue.|$|R
