Satisfactory agreement with experimental results at 1111 °K is obtained if the nearly symmetric top expressions for integrated intensities are used in conjunction with the just-overlapping line model. Part II. The general equations of radiative energy transfer are presented. When the absorption coefficients and/ or the gas volume are sufficiently large, the general transport equation can be approximated by the "diffusion approximation". This approximation is applied to a two-phase system consisting of carbon- particles dispersed in a gas. The Rosseland mean absorption coefficients are calculated for spherical carbon particles of 200 and 987 A radius at temperatures of 1000 and 2000 °K, and a comparison is made of the relative magnitudes of conductive and radiative heat transfer for this system. In the special case when scattering may be neglected, and the temperature and pressure of the gas are constant, the transport equation can be integrated for a particular direction.
