50|$|Excess {{waste heat}} created on the {{spacecraft}} is rejected to space {{by the use}} of radiators. Radiators come in several different forms, such as spacecraft structural panels, flat-plate radiators mounted {{to the side of the}} spacecraft, and panels deployed after the spacecraft is on orbit. Whatever the configuration, all radiators reject heat by infrared (IR) radiation from their surfaces. The radiating power depends on the surface's emittance and temperature. The radiator must reject both the spacecraft waste heat and any radiant-heat loads from the environment. Most radiators are therefore given surface finishes with high IR emittance to maximize heat rejection and low <b>solar</b> <b>absorptance</b> to limit heat from the sun. Most spacecraft radiators reject between 100 and 350 W of internally generated electronics waste heat per square meter. Radiators weight typically varies from almost nothing, if an existing structural panel is used as a radiator, to around 12 kg/m2 for a heavy deployable radiator and its support structure.|$|E

Instruments of this type can be operated in two different ways, according to whether spectral or integrated reflectances are measured. Though <b>solar</b> <b>absorptances</b> derived from spectral data are inherently more accurate, some commercially available reflectometers are found which are conceived for measuring integrated rather than spectral reflectances. Since these instruments are often provided with radiation sources which do not match the solar spectrum and/or detectors showing a spectrally selective response, they could in principle be affected by errors when dealing with selective surfaces. With the aim of giving an error estimate, {{the theory of the}} measurement was analyzed with reference to some selective samples well characterized for their reflectance properties.

The <b>solar</b> <b>absorptances</b> were 95 %, 71 % and 84 % for the C–SiO 2, C–ZnO and C–NiO samples, respectively.

Duplicate collectors were placed inside the vacuum canisters that provided protection from the launch, ascent, deployment, and recovery environments. Analyses of the samples show small quantities of molecular deposition on both the leading and trailing edge trays. Silicone deposits are negligible. The aluminized fused silica, second surface mirrors showed small changes in <b>solar</b> <b>absorptances.</b> This is consistent with the small quantities of molecular deposits deduced from the FTIR measurements.

40|$|One of the {{traditional}} approaches to reduce costs of solar energy is to use inexpensive reflectors to focus the light onto highly efficient solar cells. Several research projects have resulted in designs, where the excess heat is used as solar thermal energy. Unlike a solar thermal system, which has a selective surface to reduce the radiant heat loss, a CPV/T (Concentrating PhotoVoltaic/Thermal) system uses a receiver covered with solar cells with high thermal emittance. This project analyzes whether the heat loss from the receiver can be reduced by covering parts of the receiver surface, not already covered with solar cells, with an optically selective coating. Comparing different methods of applying such a coating and the long-term stability of low cost alternatives {{are also part of}} the objectives of this project. To calculate the heat loss reductions of the optically selective surface coating a mathematical model was developed, which takes the thermal emittances and the <b>solar</b> <b>absorptances</b> of the different surfaces into account. Furthermore, a full-size experiment was constructed to verify the theoretical predictions. The coating results in a heat loss reduction of approximately 20 % in such a CPV/T system and one of the companies involved in the study is already changing their design {{to make use of the}} results...|$|R
40|$|Data {{from three}} cloudy days (March 3, 21, 29, 2000) of the ARM Enhanced Shortwave Experiment II (ARESE II) were analyzed. Grand averages of {{broadband}} absorptance among {{three sets of}} instruments were compared. Fractional <b>solar</b> <b>absorptances</b> were approx. 0. 21 - 0. 22 {{with the exception of}} March 3 when two sets of instruments gave values smaller by approx. 0. 03 - 0. 04. The robustness of these values was investigated by looking into possible sampling problems with the aid of 500 nm spectral fluxes. Grand averages of 500 nm apparent absorptance cover a wide range of values for these three days, namely from a large positive (approx. 0. 011) average for March 3, to a small negative (approximately - 0. 03) for March 21, to near zero (approx. 0. 01) for March 29. We present evidence suggesting that {{a large part of the}} discrepancies among the three days is due to the different nature of clouds and their non-uniform sampling. Hence, corrections to the grand average broadband absorptance values may be necessary. However, application of the known correction techniques may be precarious due to the sparsity of collocated flux measurements above and below the clouds. Our analysis leads to the conclusion that only March 29 fulfills all requirements for reliable estimates of cloud absorption, that is, the presence of thick, overcast, homogeneous clouds...|$|R

A study {{was made of}} the effect of rocket pulse duration on exhaust damage to S 13 G white coatings. Two pulse lengths were used - 14 msec and 50 msec. An MMH/N 204 bipropellant 5 -lb thrust rocket was fired into a simulated space environment with a vacuum of 0. 00001 torr, a liquid helium temperature enclosure, and solar radiation.

In rural Africa, in particular, the demand for domestic energy is even higher. This is exacerbated by inadequate grid electricity infrastructure. This state of affairs has culminated in massive deforestation and desertification of some parts of Africa. One technology solution is to harness the energy from the sun through solar absorbers. This has applications in domestic heating – such as heating water (solar geysers) and cooking food. Early solar energy technologies were not readily accepted in Africa because of high initial investment cost and low efficiency, particularly so for the less affluent rural populace. Presently, there is a re–look into the solar energy technologies with emphasis on cost effectiveness and sustainability. In this paper we present new results on a novel selective solar absorber material. Laboratory tests show that it is about 30 % more efficient than the best alternative on the market.

40|$|Vertical {{semiconductor}} nanowires {{have gained}} considerable {{attention in the}} last decade for their attractive optical and electronic properties. Their high surface to volume ratio and their ability to confine charge carriers and photons in one dimension has enabled them to be a promising candidate for improved as well as novel devices in nanophotonics and optoelectronics. However, it is necessary to achieve high quality nanowires with controllable features to fully understand and fine-tune the optical properties of the nanowires to achieve desired applications. In this study, various semiconductor materials like Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Silicon and Amorphous Silicon (a-Si) were chosen to analyze and compare their optical properties using reflection measurements and finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations. The nature of modal excitations in nanowires with the change in their diameter, pitch, shape and length are understood through simulation studies and verified using the measure- ments. Optical waveguiding, near field coupling, Fabry-Perot modes are comprehensively understood {{for the first time in}} the nanowire arrays. The ordered nanowires arrays are fabricated using Inductively Coupled Plasma Reactive Ion Etching (ICP-RIE) and a good understanding of the etching chemistries of chosen materials is achieved to fabricate high aspect ratio (length to diameter ratio) nanowire arrays. For GaAs nanowires, the aspect ratio of up to 73 is achieved with the controlled diameters for the very first time. For a variety of hard masks, etching parameters have been developed to get a good control over the sidewalls, diameters, and shapes of the nanowires. The silicon nanowires etching parameters are modified to achieve different shapes in lateral and longitudinal directions. Lastly, Gallium Nitride (GaN) nanowires are fabricated using chlorine chemistry with nitrogen as a clean passivation gas and wide varieties of masks and their combinations have been tested to achieve vertical morphology. iii Based on the understandings we achieved for the nanowires, a new platform is introduced for a-Si nanowires by etching them on a glass substrate and by integrating thin film with them to achieve the <b>solar</b> weighed <b>absorptance</b> 200 - 250 % higher than the thin film of the same thickness.

As the comprehensive studies were done on the optical properties of the nanowire, the thesis presents a complete picture of various optical modes and phenomena, which emanate in them due to their interaction with light.
