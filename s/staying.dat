The Purpose of this research is to study the principal theory of under deck cable <b>stayed</b> and combined cable <b>stayed</b> system and analyses the behavior of the system and compared with the conventional cable <b>stayed</b> system. In this research 2 D static analysis of highway bridge have been investigated to determine the maximum and minimum stress on cable and deck, resultant moment and deflection of the bridge. Five model of the bridge with single and multiple spans are considered in this research which are the conventional design, Under-deck cable <b>stayed,</b> Intradosed, Combined cable <b>stayed</b> and Extradosed-intradosed design. The research intended to analyses the effect of the location of the cable <b>stays</b> to the overall behavior of the bridge. The manipulated variable in this analysis shows that cable <b>stay</b> above the deck produced better result than below the deck. But under-deck cable <b>stayed</b> system still produce an acceptable result that gives an option to the engineer. The analysis is successfully done using finite element software, LUSAS...|$|R
