50|$|On the {{question}} of fairness, the decisive evidence was that witnesses (for the <b>seedsmen)</b> had said the industry's practice had always been to negotiate damages claims if they seemed genuine and justified.

60|$|I {{have reason}} to think that Joe's intellects were brightened by the {{encounter}} they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook's he invented a subtle and deep design.

60|$|Now the {{response}} {{came with a}} promptness which at least testified of the lingering compunction of Miss Simpson.

It appeared {{to me that he}} must be a very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop; and I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and saw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and bloom.|$|E

To force the note, to press fantasy too hard, to deepen the gloom with black over the indigo, that was the failing which proved you mortal. To take an instance in little: when Pip went to Mr. Pumblechook's, the boy thought the <b>seedsman</b> 'a very happy man to have so many little drawers in his shop.' The reflection is thoroughly boyish; but then you add, 'I wondered whether the flower-seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails and bloom.' That is not boyish at all; that is the hard-driven, jaded literary fancy at work.|$|E

60|$|But this spare {{return was}} richly enough for Langbourne; {{it would have}} sufficed, {{if there had been}} nothing in the letter, that the {{handwriting}} proved Miss Simpson to have been the one who had made the entry of her name and her friend's in the hotel register. This was most important as one step in corroboration {{of the fact that he}} had rightly divined her; that the rest should come true was almost a logical necessity. Still, he was puzzled to contrive a pretext for writing again, and he remained without one for a fortnight. Then, in passing a seedsman's store which he used to pass every day without thinking, he one day suddenly perceived his opportunity. He went in and got a number of the catalogues and other advertisements, and addressed them then and there, in a wrapper the <b>seedsman</b> gave him, to Miss Barbara F.

60|$|Where {{could we}} turn, and {{not find a}} desolation {{pregnant}} with the dire lesson of example? The fields had been left uncultivated, weeds and gaudy flowers sprung up,--or where a few wheat-fields shewed signs of the living hopes of the husbandman, the work had been left halfway, the ploughman had died beside the plough; the horses had deserted the furrow, and no <b>seedsman</b> had approached the dead; the cattle unattended wandered over the fields and through the lanes; the tame inhabitants of the poultry yard, baulked of their daily food, had become wild--young lambs were dropt in flower-gardens, and the cow stalled {{in the hall of}} pleasure. Sickly and few, the country people neither went out to sow nor reap; but sauntered about the meadows, or lay under the hedges, when the inclement sky did not drive them to take shelter under the nearest roof. Many of those who remained, secluded themselves; some had laid up stores which should prevent the necessity of leaving their homes;--some deserted wife and child, and imagined that they secured their safety in utter solitude. Such had been Ryland's plan, and he was discovered dead and half-devoured by insects, in a house many miles from any other, with piles of food laid up in useless superfluity. Others made long journies to unite themselves to those they loved, and arrived to find them dead.|$|E
60|$|If you are {{a farmer}} or any sort of horticulturist, a fruit or flower grower, let us say, or a <b>seedsman,</b> you will {{probably}} find yourself still farming under Socialism--that is to say, renting land and getting what you can out of it. Your rent will be fixed {{just as it is}} to-day by what people will give. But your landlord will be the Municipality or the County, and the rent you pay will largely come back to you in repairs, in the guiding reports and advice of the Agricultural Department, in improved roads, in subventions to a good electric car service to take your produce to market; in aids and education for your children. You will probably have a greater fixity of tenure and a clearer ownership in improvements than you have to-day. I am inclined to think that your dairying and milking and so forth will be done for you wholesale in big public dairies and mills because of the economy of that; you will send up the crude produce and sell it, perhaps, to the county association to brand and distribute. It is probable you will sell your crops standing, and the public authority will organize the harvesting and bring out an army of workers from the towns to gather your fruit, hops and corn. You will need, therefore, only a small permanent staff of labourers, and these {{are much more likely to}} be partners with you in the enterprise than wage workers needing to be watched and driven.|$|E
60|$|The {{present one}} {{is timed to}} leave the town {{at four in the}} {{afternoon}} precisely, and it is now half-past three by the clock in the turret {{at the top of the}} street. In a few seconds errand-boys from the shops begin to arrive with packages, which they fling into the vehicle, and turn away whistling, and care for the packages no more. At twenty minutes to four an elderly woman places her basket upon the shafts, slowly mounts, takes up a seat inside, and folds her hands and her lips. She has secured her corner for the journey, though there is as yet no sign of a horse being put in, nor of a carrier. At the three-quarters, two other women arrive, in whom the first recognizes the postmistress of Upper Longpuddle and the registrar's wife, they recognizing her as the aged groceress of the same village. At five minutes to the hour there approach Mr. Profitt, the schoolmaster, in a soft felt hat, and Christopher Twink, the master-thatcher; and as the hour strikes there rapidly drop in the parish clerk and his wife, the <b>seedsman</b> and his aged father, the registrar; also Mr. Day, the world-ignored local landscape-painter, an elderly man who resides in his native place, and has never sold a picture outside it, though his pretensions to art have been nobly supported by his fellow- villagers, whose confidence in his genius has been as remarkable as the outer neglect of it, leading them to buy his paintings so extensively (at the price of a few shillings each, it is true) that every dwelling in the parish exhibits three or four of those admired productions on its walls.|$|E
40|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century and {{in the early years of}} the twentieth century wattle was {{circulated}} by botanists, botanical institutions, interested individuals, commercial <b>seedsmen</b> and government authorities. Wattle bark was used in the production of leather and was the subject of debate regarding its commercial development and conservation in Australia. It was also trialled in many other locations including America, New Zealand, Hawaii and Russia. In the process, South Africa became a major producer of wattle bark for a global market. At the same time wattle was also promoted as a symbol of Australian nationalism. This paper considers this movement of wattles, wattle material and wattle information by examining the career of one active agent in these botanical transfers: Joseph Maiden. In doing so it demonstrates that these seemingly different uses of the wattle overlap transnational and national spheres...|$|R
60|$|There were no real vegetables, {{but only}} the ideals of a firm of <b>seedsmen,</b> made of wax and splendidly coloured, with {{something}} of the boldness and vigour of Michael Angelo about the modelling of them.

At last we felt replete with food stuffs, {{and went on to}} see the models to illustrate ventilation, and the exhibits of hygienic glazed tiles arranged around a desert lecture-theatre. Hygienic tiles stimulate the eye vigorously rather than relax it by any Ã¦sthetic weakness; and the crematory appliances are so attractive as they are, and must have such an added charm of neatness and brightness when alight, that one longs to lose a relative or so forthwith, for the mere pleasure of seeing them in operation.|$|R
