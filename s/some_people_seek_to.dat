Harold Napoleon is a Yup'ik Eskimo who wrote his book to try to make sense of the profound sadness of his people, and to understand how he came to cause the death of his own son as a result of alcohol abuse. In the book, Harold suggests that his people were suffering from a kind of post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of the [...] "Great Death" [...] in which his culture and people were nearly wiped out by disease and other traumatic experiences resulting from contact with European settlers. He further suggests that denial, nallunguarluku, literally ‘pretending it didn’t happen,’ has become something of a cultural trait, one manifestation of which is difficulty in talking about painful circumstances…which can lead to alienation, anger, and self-destructive behavior that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> numb with alcohol" [...] (Napoleon, viii).|$|E
30|$|There are two {{important}} points here regarding {{the role of}} these concepts. First, co-management and co-existence are invoked, for better or worse, by many different institutions in contexts where {{they are trying to}} collaborate across cross-cultural and cross-situational divides. Second, the example of co-existence I gave {{is an example of how}} <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> use concepts to improve collaboration by inviting people to consider alternatives that may not have been on their conceptual radar before. The concept of TEK and its synonyms plays a somewhat analogous role to the term co-existence. As in the first point, various definitions of TEK are used in collaborative contexts, for better or worse. As in the second point, those who bring new definitions of TEK into dialogue are inviting others to consider new possibilities for thinking about the function of knowledge systems in environmental governance.|$|E
40|$|The "State of the Air 2017 " found {{continued}} {{improvement in}} air quality in 2013 - 2015 in ozone and year-round particle pollution, but an unrelenting increase in dangerous spikes in particle pollution. These trends demonstrate the continued {{need to support}} and enforce the Clean Air Act to protect the nation from unhealthy air. The "State of the Air 2017 " report shows that cleaning up pollution continues successfully {{in much of the}} nation. In the 25 cities with the worst ozone and year-round particle pollution, the majority saw improvements from last year. Many again reached their lowest levels ever of these widespread air pollutants. Yet, even as most cities experienced strong improvement, too many cities suffered worse episodes of unhealthy air. While most of the nation has much cleaner air quality than even a decade ago, many cities reported their highest number of unhealthy days since the report began, including some that experienced extreme weather events. The "State of the Air 2017 " report shows that, even with continued improvement, too many people in the United States live where the air is unhealthy for them to breathe. Despite that continued need and the nation's progress, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> weaken the Clean Air Act, the public health law that has driven the cuts in pollution since 1970, and to undermine the ability of the nation to fight for healthy air. The "State of the Air 2017 " report looks at levels of ozone and particle pollution found in official monitoring sites across the United States in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The report uses the most current quality-assured nationwide data available for these analyses. The report examines particle pollution (PM 2. 5) in two different ways: averaged year-round (annual average) and over short-term levels (24 -hour). For both ozone and short-term particle pollution, the analysis uses a weighted average number of days that allows recognition of places with higher levels of pollution. For the year-round particle pollution rankings, the report uses averages calculated and reported by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). For comparison, the "State of the Air 2016 " report covered data from 2012, 2013 and 2014...|$|E

Principles of personal responsibility, autonomy and free will should prevail to deny a negligence claim. The risk of obesity and concomitant health problems from eating fast food to excess is an obvious risk which the plaintiff should not have ignored and which he or she has voluntarily assumed. It is for the Australian Government, not the courts, to regulate the behaviour of the fast-food industry. The government should take action by requiring all major fast-food chains to label their products with nutritional information, and by imposing restrictions on the advertising of food to children...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that favorable intergroup contact experiences reduce prejudice. We were interested in identifying personality variables that might lead <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> out favorable intergroup contact experiences and others to avoid them. Broadly, this process is called situational selection. Our main proposition is that the personality traits of openness, agreeableness, and authoritarianism influence the extent <b>to</b> which <b>people</b> <b>seek</b> out and enter into favorable intergroup contact situations, which, in turn, lead to favorable intergroup attitudes. The specific outgroups we examined {{for this study were}} Muslims, refugees, immigrants, the military, and Christian fundamentalists. To test our predictions, we asked 293 participants to complete measures of personality, intergroup contact experiences, and intergroup attitudes. Our main hypothesis was supported. Intergroup attitudes were significantly affected by the personality traits of openness, agreeableness, and authoritarianism, and these relationships were mediated by contact experiences. However, the strength of the relationships was also dependent on which outgroup was being evaluated. These results have implications for contact theory, which has generally neglected the potential role of personality. In addition, our results reveal a potential mechanism (intergroup contact) that may help explain why certain personality traits are associated with intergroup attitudes. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Although tumors on {{the surface}} of the skin are {{considered}} to be easily recognizable, neglected advanced skin neoplasms are encountered even in the 21 st century.

40|$|Individual {{differences}} in reward drive and sensitivity, reward preference, and impulsivity lead <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> more frequent, and less healthy reward (e. g., energy-dense foods and illicit substances). Healthy lifestyle choices {{tend to be}} associated with higher well-being and overall life satisfaction, yet the links between reward traits, health-related behaviours and well-being remain unclear. The current study investigated the link between reward approach traits, behaviours, and quality of life outcomes in an online panel (n = 1619, ages 18 – 50). Reward drive (RD), based on the revised behavioural activation system (rBAS) was associated with higher overall well-being. This relationship was partially mediated by fruit and vegetable intake, exercise, and volunteering. Rash impulsivity (RI) was positively associated with drug, alcohol and tobacco use, poor diet, lack of sleep and gambling problems; and was also related to lower overall well-being. This relationship was partially mediated by lack of sleep. This suggests that individuals high in RD are likely to enjoy increased levels of overall well-being, partly due to their tendency to engage in healthy behaviours. Those high in RI are more likely to risk their health for hedonic risky pursuits; however, such risky pursuits appear to have little impact on well-being...|$|R

5000|$|Self-awareness theory, {{developed}} by Duval and Wicklund in their 1972 landmark book A theory of objective self awareness, states {{that when we}} focus our attention on ourselves, we evaluate and compare our current behavior to our internal standards and values. This elicits a state of objective self-awareness. We become self-conscious as objective evaluators of ourselves. However self-awareness {{is not to be}} confused with self-consciousness. Various emotional states are intensified by self-awareness. However, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> may <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> increase their self-awareness through these outlets. People are more likely to align their behavior with their standards when made self-aware. People will be negatively affected if they don't live up to their personal standards. Various environmental cues and situations induce awareness of the self, such as mirrors, an audience, or being videotaped or recorded. These cues also increase accuracy of personal memory. In one of Demetriou's neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development, self-awareness develops systematically from birth through the life span and it is a major factor for the development of general inferential processes. Moreover, a series of recent studies showed that self-awareness about cognitive processes participates in general intelligence on a par with processing efficiency functions, such as working memory, processing speed, and reasoning. Albert Bandura's theory of self-efficacy builds on our varying degrees of self-awareness. It is [...] "the belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations." [...] A person's belief in their ability to succeed sets the stage to how they think, behave and feel. Someone with a strong self-efficacy, for example, views challenges as mere tasks that must be overcome, and are not easily discouraged by setbacks. They are aware of their flaws and abilities and choose to utilize these qualities to the best of their ability. Someone with a weak sense of self-efficacy evades challenges and quickly feels discouraged by setbacks. They may not be aware of these negative reactions, and therefore do not always change their attitude. This concept is central to Bandura's social cognitive theory, [...] "which emphasizes the role of observational learning, social experience, and reciprocal determinism in the development of personality." ...|$|R
40|$|Society as a {{whole is}} {{becoming}} more immersed in the age of technology and people are taking severe weather sheltering decisions into their own hands more than ever before. People are going through a complex process when a warning is received, a process that is still not well understood by scientists. In this study, an online survey was used to evaluate various parameters including basic demographics, weather knowledge and experience, and thought-processes during severe weather, to help gain an understanding of this social process and make better connections between why <b>some</b> <b>people</b> choose <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> shelter and why others do not. Through statistical analysis, significant relationships were found corresponding to the presence of family and friends increasing shelter-seeking behaviors, especially for males. Individuals who use three or more warning information sources to make sheltering decisions during the warning-response process were found to be more likely to shelter than those using fewer. Respondents who had a general fear of tornadoes tended to have increased sheltering behavior when compared to those who said they did not fear tornadoes. Likeliness to shelter tended to increase with age. The findings of this study also brought to light communication issues between the public and the meteorology community, including confusion revolving around outdoor warning sirens and county-based warnings. The public relies on outdoor warning sirens, but there isn’t a clear understanding of their purpose and use. County-based warnings are perceived as false warnings to unaffected portions of the county, sometimes decreasing an individual’s likeliness to shelter in the future...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol-related health {{outcomes}} show strikingly high inci-dence in Hungary. The effects of alcohol consumption are influenced {{not only by}} the quantity, but also the quality of drinks; therefore, wine production can have an important effect on public {{health outcomes}}. Nevertheless, the Hungarian wine sector faces several vital problems and challenges influenced by the country’s accession to the European Union and by the need for restructuring. A comprehensive health impact assessment (HIA) based on the evaluation of the Hungarian legislation related to the wine sector has been carried out, aiming {{to assess the impact of}} the production of quality wine versus that of table wine, using a range of public health and epidemiolo-gical research methods and data as well as HIA guidelines. The study finds that the toxic effects of alcohol can be reduced with an increased supply of quality wine and with decreased overall consumption due to higher cost, although this might drive <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> illegal sources. Quality wine production allows for improved use of land, creates employment opportunities and increases the incomes of producers and local communities; however, capital-scarce producers unable to manage restructuring may lose their source of subsistence. The supply of quality wine can promote social relations, contribute to a healthy lifestyle and reduce criminality related to alcohol’s influ-ence and adulteration. In general, the production and supply of quality wine can have an overall positive impact on health. Nevertheless, because of the several possible negative effects expected without purposeful restructuring, recommendations for the maximization of favourable outcomes and suggestions for monitoring the success of the analysis have been provided. Key words: health impact assessment; quality wine; wine productio...|$|R
40|$|This poster {{describes}} {{research that}} examines how film {{may be used}} to communicate the value and importance of subsistence hunting for Inuit to non-Indigenous populations in a case study of seal hunting among Inuit in Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, Canada. Subsistence hunting is the basis for food production among Inuit and has strong economic, dietary and cultural importance. The value and importance of subsistence hunting for Inuit, however, is sometimes not reflected in the decisions of non-Indigenous populations such as the ban on the importation of seal products to several countries with negative impacts for Inuit communities. Th e objectives of the research are to use film to: (1) document and explain the value and mportance of subsistence seal hunting for Inuit; (2) portray subsistence seal hunting through the eyes of Inuit hunters and their families; and (3) preserve and promote the value and importance of subsistence seal hunting to younger generation Inuit and non-Indigenous populations. A short documentarystyle film will be created in partnership with Inuit in the hamlet of Ulukhaktok. Th is will involve conducting filmed interviews with community members about the importance of seal to their diet and culture and through participant observation and filming of seal hunting, fur and meat preparation, food sharing, and sewing. Th e project responds to the anti-sealing protests of <b>some</b> non-Indigenous <b>peoples</b> and <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> communicate an honest and accurate presentation of the value and importance of seal hunting for Inuit.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons why {{workplaces}} should focus on problems related to alcohol use and misuse. These include the associated risk of greater ill-health, accidents leading to injury, absenteeism, and negative effects on the atmosphere in the workplace. The main purpose of this thesis was to examine the feasibility and limitations of alcohol screening as part of regular health examinations. A further aim was to examine the feasibility, limitations and effects of brief intervention in a workplace. The pilot project was carried out in workplaces in the paper, pulp and wood industry. The main project, a randomized controlled study, was carried out at a large workplace in the transport sector over a period of 48 months. In the main project, employees who came to the occupational health service (OHS) for a regular health examination were given the opportunity to undergo voluntary alcohol screening. The screening and follow-up consisted of self-reporting, using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and the carbohydrate deficient transferrin in serum (CDT) blood test. The serum gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) test was also used for comparison purposes. The results from the pilot study suggest that alcohol screening is not time-consuming for the OHS. Offering employees voluntary alcohol screening in conjunction with a health examination may well encourage <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> advice and support for their alcohol problems. The results from the main study suggest that the AUDIT and CDT should be regarded as complementary test for alcohol screening in a routine workplace health examination, and that each is of value for identifying different segments of the at-risk drinking population. Our data indicate that individuals with moderately elevated or risky levels of alcohol consumption show an increase in sick-days. Individuals who screened positive on the AUDIT andlor CDT test did not demonstrate more long, continuous periods of sickness absence or absence on Monday or Fridays. Shift workers did not drink more alcohol than permanent day workers, according to the AUDIT, CDT and GGT results. In fact, the opposite was observed for 2 -shift workers according to CDT. Of those employees who participated in the follow-up, almost 50 % had negative test results. Despite this, {{there were no significant differences}} at screening and follow-up between the intervention groups and the control group, neither in relation to the AUDIT, CDT, or GGT. Nor was there any difference in the number of sick-days during the study period between those who screened positive and those who screened negative. In summary: it appears to be feasible to carry out alcohol screening and brief intervention as part of regular health examinations and there is a good reason to use a more systematic approach to alcohol screening in conjunction with routine workplace health examination...|$|R
