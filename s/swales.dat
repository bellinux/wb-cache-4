5|$|Fire {{response}} {{may also}} furnish {{an explanation for}} the evolution of this species. The differences in fire regime between dune crests and <b>swales</b> would have created different evolutionary pressures, with plants on crests adapting to frequent hot fires by becoming strongly serotinous, and plants in <b>swales</b> adapting to patchier, cooler fires with weaker serotiny. Speciation would be made possible by the much reduced genetic exchange between crest plants and swale plants, although evidence suggests that there was some introgression at first. Eventually, however, the need for weakly serotinous plants to produce ripe seed by the bushfire season would have brought forward its flowering season until the flowering seasons no longer overlapped; thus a phenological barrier to exchange was erected, allowing the two populations to drift independently of each other.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes occurs {{throughout}} much of the Southwest Botanical Province, occurring both along the west coast and well inland, and ranging from Shark Bay (25°30′S) in the north, to Kojonup (33°50'S) and Jerramungup (34°24'S 118°55'E) in the south and south-east respectively. It grows among tall shrubland or low woodland, mostly in the <b>swales</b> and lower slopes of dunes, and shows a very strong preference for deep white or yellow sand.|$|E
5|$|In the 1996–97 season, {{even the}} {{turnover}} {{rate of the}} <b>Swales</b> years was surpassed, with five managers (three permanent appointments and two caretakers) taking charge of first team affairs {{during the course of}} the season. The third of these was Steve Coppell, the shortest serving manager in the club's history, who resigned on ill health grounds after 32 days as manager. The final of the five, Frank Clark, saw out the season but did not last much longer, losing his job in February 1998 with the club on the brink of relegation to the third tier of English football. Joe Royle was unable to prevent relegation, but subsequently achieved successive promotions to restore top flight status, though relegation a year later resulted in his sacking.|$|E
50|$|South <b>Swale</b> is {{a nature}} reserve between Faversham and Whitstable in {{southeast}} England. It is a Local Nature Reserve (called South Bank of the <b>Swale)</b> {{and it is}} part of The <b>Swale</b> Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|R
50|$|From {{here the}} route {{continues}} across the flat plains of <b>Swale,</b> past Bobbing(on the left), Kemsley and Milton Regis(on the right). As it approaches <b>Swale</b> railway {{station on the}} southern banks of the <b>Swale,</b> the road now becomes the Sheppey Way which now bridges the <b>Swale</b> via the Sheppey Crossing, opened in 2006, having previously used the Kingsferry Bridge which has to be lifted to allow ships {{to pass on the}} <b>Swale.</b> Non-motorised traffic still uses the old route and rejoins the A249 on the island.|$|R
50|$|The trail {{consists}} of two sections; one along the Klickitat river, from Lyle to <b>Swale</b> Canyon, and the remainder which continues through <b>Swale</b> Canyon to Warwick. The <b>Swale</b> Canyon section is closed during fire season, approximately July 1 - October 1.|$|R
5|$|Lying {{within a}} coastal plain, the St. Johns River passes through {{an area that}} was at one time barrier islands, coastal dunes, and estuary marshes. The Florida Peninsula was created {{primarily}} by forces and minerals from the ocean. It lies so low that minor fluctuations in sea levels can have a dramatic effect on its geomorphology. Florida was once part of the supercontinent Gondwana. Lying underneath the visible rock formations is a basement of igneous granite and volcanic composition under a sedimentary layer formed during the Paleozoic era 542 to 251 million years ago. During the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 million years ago), the basement and its sedimentary overlay were further covered by calcium carbonate and formations left by the evaporation of water called evaporites. What covers the peninsula {{is the result of}} simultaneous processes of deposits of sands, shells, and coral, and erosion from water and weather. As ocean water has retreated and progressed, the peninsula has been covered with sea water at least seven times. Waves compressed sands, calcium carbonate, and shells into limestone; at the ocean's edge, beach ridges were created by this depositional forming. North-south axis rivers, such as the St. Johns, were created by past beach ridges which were often divided by <b>swales.</b> As ocean water retreated, lagoons formed in the <b>swales,</b> which were further eroded by acidic water. Barrier islands, furthermore, formed along the Atlantic Coast, surrounding the lagoon with land and forming a freshwater river.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.prionotes {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.prionotes is unusual in that it does not fit neatly into either of these groups. It lacks a lignotuber or thick bark, and so cannot be considered a resprouter; yet it may survive or escape some fires because of its height, the sparseness of its foliage, and because it occurs in dune <b>swales</b> where fire are cooler and patchier. On the other hand, it is not a typical reseeder either, because of its relatively low fire mortality rates, and because it is only weakly serotinous: although fire promotes seed release, seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} almost totally {{restricted}} to the <b>swales</b> and lower slopes of dunes. Various reasons for this have been proposed; on the one hand, {{it has been argued}} that its dependence on ground water necessitates that it grow only where ground water is relatively near the surface; on the other hand, it has been suggested that it cannot survive in higher parts of the landscape because fires are too frequent there. The latter hypothesis is supported by the recent expansion of B.prionotes along road verges of the Brand Highway, where fires are relatively rare. Despite B.prionotes occurrence in lower parts of the landscape, it does not occur in areas prone to flooding, because of its intolerance of heavy soils, and because extended periods of flooding kill seedlings. However, recent falls of the water table on the Swan Coastal Plain have seen B.prionotes replace the more water-loving Banksia littoralis in some areas that were previously flood-prone.|$|E
50|$|Beyond the <b>Swale</b> Way, {{the area}} towards the <b>Swale</b> is still marshland. The Murston Lakes {{connected}} to the <b>Swale</b> and were initially constructed for earlier brickworks, were later used for oyster rearing and {{are now part of}} 'Little Murston Nature Reserve'. They are designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA). Passing along the <b>Swale</b> along the Milton Creek towards Sittingbourne is the Saxon Shore Way (a long-distance path around most of Kent).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Swale</b> Baronetcy, of <b>Swale</b> Hall in the County of York, was a {{title in}} the Baronetage of England. It was created on 21 June 1660 for Solomon <b>Swale,</b> Member of Parliament for Aldborough. The title became either extinct or dormant {{on the death of}} the fourth Baronet some time after 1741.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Swale</b> is a {{strip of}} sea {{separating}} North Kent from the Isle of Sheppey. The <b>Swale</b> was originally part of a river valley facing eastwards. As sea-levels rose, water occupied the whole length of the valley, dividing today's Isle of Sheppey from the mainland. The <b>Swale</b> forms both a National Nature Reserve and a Special Protection Area.|$|R

25|$|Edwin Essery <b>Swales</b> {{was one of}} four {{children}} born in Inanda, Natal, South Africa to Harry Evelyn <b>Swales,</b> who was a farmer in the Heatonville district, and Olive Miriam Essery. Following the death of her husband in the influenza epidemic of 1918-19, Mrs <b>Swales</b> and her children moved to the Berea, Durban. Here, Edwin <b>Swales</b> attended Durban High School (DHS). As a young lad, Edwin had also {{been a member of the}} Boy Scout movement (4th Durban Scout Troop). After leaving school, and prior to the Second World War, Edwin <b>Swales</b> worked for Barclays Bank (Dominion Colonial and Overseas - DCO) in Durban. <b>Swales</b> had joined the Natal Mounted Rifles before the War, rising to the rank of Sergeant Major, (officially, a Warrant Officer, 2nd Class). With the N.M.R., in the early part of the War, he saw action in Kenya, Abyssinia and in North Africa. He then transferred to the South African Air Force on 17 January 1942.|$|E
25|$|<b>Swales</b> can be {{incorporated}} in urban designs along streets or parklands {{and add to the}} aesthetic character of an area. Typical <b>swales</b> are created with longitudinal slopes between 1% and 4% in order to maintain flow capacity without creating high velocities, potential erosion of the bioretention or swale surface and safety hazard. In steeper areas check banks along <b>swales</b> or dense vegetation can help to distribute ﬂows evenly across <b>swales</b> and slow velocities. Milder-sloped <b>swales</b> may have issues with water-logging and stagnant ponding, in which case underdrains can be employed to alleviate problems. If the swale is to be vegetated, vegetation must be capable of withstanding design ﬂows and be of sufficient density to provide good ﬁltration). Ideally, vegetation height should be above treatment ﬂow water levels. If runoff enters directly into a swale, perpendicular to the main ﬂow direction, the edge of the swale acts as a buffer and provides pre-treatment for the water entering the swale.|$|E

25|$|Bioretention <b>swales,</b> {{similar to}} buffer strips and <b>swales,</b> are placed within {{the base of}} a swale that is {{generally}} located in the median strip of divided roads. They provide both stormwater treatment and are. A bioretention system can be installed in part of a swale, or along the full length of a swale, depending on treatment requirements. The runoff water usually goes through a fine media filter and proceeds downwards where it is collected via a perforated pipe leading to downstream waterways or storages. Vegetation growing in the filter media can prevent erosion and, unlike infiltration systems, bioretention <b>swales</b> are suited {{for a wide range of}} soil conditions.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, {{while with}} the RAF Pathfinders (No. 582 Squadron), <b>Swales</b> was the Master Bomber and captain of Avro Lancaster III PB538.

25|$|The {{original}} set of miniature medals belonging to <b>Swales,</b> {{and a silver}} model Lancaster Bomber, are now housed in an exhibition honouring <b>Swales</b> at his old school, Durban High School. Many years ago, the miniature medals and the model had been sold {{by a member of}} the <b>Swales</b> family. After changing hands a few times, the group came up for auction in London in July 2004, at which time the medals and model were sold to a UK collector. A medal collector and D.H.S. Old Boy tracked down the buyer and convinced him to sell his recent acquisitions to the School. After four months of negotiations, the medals and model were delivered to their new home at DHS, where they were first displayed on Armistice Day, 11 November 2004.|$|E

25|$|Bioretention systems {{involve the}} {{treatment}} of water by vegetation prior to filtration of sediment and other solids through prescribed media. Vegetation provides biological uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus and other soluble or ﬁne particulate contaminants. Bioretention systems offer a smaller footprint than other similar measures (e.g. constructed wetlands) and are commonly used to filter and treat runoff prior to it reaching street drains. Use on larger scales can be complicated and hence other devices may be more appropriate. Biorentention systems comprise bioretention <b>swales</b> (also referred to as grassed <b>swales</b> and drainage channels) and bioretention basins.|$|E
