I have a great [...] reverence for antiquity. I rejoice in the great deeds of our [...] fathers in England and in Scotland. It may be said, however, that [...] this does not go very far towards making a man a liberal. I find, [...] however, that the tories when it suits their purpose have much [...] less reverence for antiquity than I have. They make changes with [...] great rapidity, provided they are suitable to the promotion of [...] tory interests. But the basis of my liberalism is this. It is the [...] lesson which I have been learning ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young.</b> I am a [...] lover of liberty; and that liberty which I value for myself, I [...] value for every human being in proportion to his means and [...] opportunities. That is a basis on which I find it perfectly [...] practicable to work {{in conjunction with a}} dislike to unreasoned [...] change and a profound reverence for everything ancient, provided [...] that reverence is deserved.

"Let Me Know" [...] is a ballad {{written by}} Way, who had {{previously}} written songs {{as a member of}} indie band N.Dolphin, and the lyrics are based on her and Choa's struggle to become singers.

When she arrived in Montevideo, she knew one name through a relative and asked if he would like to manufacture menswear. When he agreed, the ecstatic Cecile began Tricot. While in Uruguay, Cecile stayed in the resort town of Punte del Este. She was so taken with the country and the places she had been that she named her company after her favorite hotel in Montevideo, The Hotel St. Raphael.

5000|$|Always gigging, The Rumble Strips found {{themselves}} {{at the front of}} the then exploding live music scene. Often performing in the early clubs and parties of East London. It was at such a gig that the independent record label Transgressive Records - who have produced singles for The Young Knives and Regina Spektor - noticed the band, eventually offering to release the band's first single. It was over this period that Waller had left the band, but decided to not pass up this opportunity of a first release and so together they released [...] "Motorcycle" [...] on 12th December 2005. Waller said at this time [...] "It was like, What have I to lose? - <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young</b> I'd always been in bands until a few months ago and now i'm just working on a building site.". The band moved further into the public eye with a number of key support dates for Dirty Pretty Things and fellow Transgressive artists The Young Knives in early 2006, and then the release of their second single, [...] "Hate Me (You Do)" [...] on 5 June. A further tour supporting The Zutons, and the release of the band's first EP, Cardboard Coloured Dreams, followed this in November 2006.|$|E

For {{the past}} four years, I have had the {{opportunity}} to continue learning and studying to become a special education teacher. In addition, I have been fascinated by technology and believe it is important to stay up-to-date with the current trends. Therefore, I wanted my honors thesis to incorporate education and technology. I decided to focus on assistive technology and how it is used in Indiana schools. The purpose of my honors thesis was to learn more about assistive technology (AT) and then to share that knowledge with others. There were several components to my thesis. Through reading articles from the Internet and books and by taking a technology class (SpeED 331) at Ball State University, my understanding about assistive technology greatly increased. I also surveyed some Indiana public high school teachers about their knowledge and use ofAT. During the fall semester of 2011, I gave two presentations about assistive technology and the survey results at club meetings on campus. In addition, I invited Daniel McNulty, associate director of professional development and northeast regional coordinator for Promoting Achievement through Technology and Instruction for all Students (PA TINS) Project, to give a presentation at Ball State University.
