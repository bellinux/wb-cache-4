2500|$|A voltage {{regulator}} under a black, cylindrical cover was mounted {{low on the}} back of frame 11, directly behind the pilot's seat:starting in the N30xx series this was repositioned higher, appearing low in the rear transparency. From N32xx the regulator was mounted directly behind the pilot's headrest on frame 11. Other changes were made later in 1939 when a simplified design of pitot tube was introduced and the [...] "rod" [...] aerial mast was replaced by a streamlined, tapered design. To improve protection for the pilot and fuel tanks a thick laminated glass bulletproof plate was fitted to the curved, one piece windscreen and a 3mm thick cover of light alloy, capable of deflecting small calibre rounds, was fitted {{over the top of the}} two fuel tanks. From about mid-1940, 73 pounds (33kg) of armoured steel plating was provided in the form of head and back protection on the seat bulkhead and covering the forward face of the glycol header tank.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} operation of a fraction collector used to direct flow of separated biological materials from 197 capillary tubes to either a collection tray or to a waste tank. This mechanism uses a 28 -volt dc gear motor driving twin cams to force 197 needles through a <b>self-sealing</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> septum, where they inject the material in 197 separate pockets in a collection tray. The position of the collector tray is sensed by two optical limit switches. The time sequences are controlled automatically by an electronics control monitoring module...|$|R

Their fuel tanks were also well {{protected}} by layers of <b>self-sealing</b> <b>rubber,</b> although the tracer ammunition which was carried by RAF fighters could sometimes ignite fuel vapour in empty tanks.|$|E

40|$|During anaesthesia, {{drugs are}} {{frequently}} adminis-tered i. v. via the <b>self-sealing</b> <b>rubber</b> injection site at the patient {{end of an}} i. v. administration set. If, during surgery, {{the position of the}} i. v. cannula is inaccessible, the injection site can be moved to a more convenient place by the use of extension tubing. When this was done during clinical investigations involving neostigmine, it was noted that, on several occasions following its injection, there was an unexpected delay of over 6 min before the effect of neostigmine was seen. Therefore it was decided to investigate the delivery time of drugs injected via extension tubing and to see how this varied with the rate of the i. v. infusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental investigation A 1 -litre container of physiological saline was connected to a cannula (Abbocath 16 -gauge) via a standard i. v. fluid administration set (Avon Medicals type A 100) and extension tubing (Avon Medicals type A 60, length 1250 mm, volume 15 ml) as shown in figure 1. The infusion rate was controlled over a wide range by raising or lowering the bag of saline and adjusting a gate clamp on the tubing of the giving set. Injections were made with physiological saline coloured with bromophenol blue, the concentration of which was measured by absorption at 590 nm on a u. v. spectrophotometer (Cecil Instruments type CE 595). The following procedure was used to establish the delivery time of a given fraction of the injectate. First, the nominal infusion rate was set by adjusting the gate clamp on the tubing (fig. 1) ...|$|E
30|$|Gas {{sampling}} for methane started 0  days after rice transplanting (DAT) {{and ended}} 14  days after harvest, {{and the gas}} samples were collected once weekly from 8 : 00 to 10 : 00  a.m. The measurement of methane emissions were measured using the static closed chamber technique (Crill et al. 1988; Wang and Wang 2003). The chamber of 50 -cm length, 30 -cm breadth and 70 -cm height made of 6 -mm thick acrylic sheets were used. The height of the chambers ranging from 90 to 120  cm was used during the later crop-growing period to accommodate the increasing plant height. To accommodate the chamber, rectangular U-shaped aluminum channels (50  cm[*]×[*] 30  cm) were used. The aluminum channels were inserted into the soil {{to a depth of}} 15  cm well ahead of gas sample collection. Each aluminum channel enclosed six plants of rice and covered an area of 0.25  m 2 (0.5  m[*]×[*] 0.5  m) to a height of 0.5 or 1.2  m (according to plant height). Each chamber was equipped with interior circulating fans to ensure complete gas mixing and to minimise changes in air temperature inside the chamber during sampling. For rice-growing season, an aluminum channel was inserted in each treatment field plot and remained there during the entire monitoring period. The top edge of the frame had a groove that could be filled with water to seal the rim of the chamber. Four gas samples were collected at 15 -min intervals over the course of 45  min. Gas samples were drawn from the chambers using a 50 -ml airtight syringe fitted with a three-way stop-cock and a fine needle inserted through the other <b>self-sealing</b> <b>rubber</b> septum. The samples were brought to the laboratory immediately after collection and methane concentration in the gas samples were analysed using a gas chromatograph (Varian, CP- 3800 GC, USA) equipped with a flame ionisation detector (FID) and a chromopack capillary column. Column, injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 50, 90 and 150  °C, respectively. The gas chromatographic system was calibrated periodically with a standard obtained from National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi, India. Nitrogen (99.999 % pure) was used as a carrier gas whereas hydrogen and zero air were used for ignition of the flame in the FID. Methane fluxes (CH 4 mg/m 2 /h) were calculated from the temporal increase in the gas concentration inside the box using the equation of Parashar et al. (1996).|$|E
