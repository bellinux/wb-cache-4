5|$|Australian National Airways (ANA) never {{recovered}} from {{the crash of the}} Amana. Since the beginning of 1945, 77 people had been killed in accidents in aircraft operated by ANA. In late 1948, ANA suffered 4 crashes in 4 months. The loss of ANA's reputation as a safe airline, together with the unblemished <b>safety</b> <b>record</b> and growing commercial success of its rival Trans Australia Airlines, sent ANA into decline. In 1957 ANA was taken over by Ansett Transport Industries Limited and merged with Ansett Airways to form the domestic airline Ansett-ANA.|$|E

In 1995, the airline posted its first profit on revenues of US$1.05 billion, one year ahead of schedule. Internationally, EVA Air's rapid expansion and increased passenger volume was boosted by its <b>safety</b> <b>record,</b> {{in contrast to}} its primary competitor, China Airlines. In addition to receiving IOSA (IATA Operational Safety Audit) certification, EVA Air in 1997 achieved simultaneous official ISO 9002 certification {{in the areas of}} Passenger, Cargo, and Maintenance Services.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{frequent}} derailments, {{low speed}} meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} <b>safety</b> <b>record.</b> The locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks {{from one of the}} Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety {{presented}} a challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, {{not to mention the}} largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since it did not matter where accidents occurred, this included safety off the job, in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included in job training, and safety training courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its <b>safety</b> <b>record.</b> The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic Safety Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road <b>safety</b> <b>record</b> than other towns of comparable size.|$|E

The USAF did not reveal whether any other officer involved in the chain of events leading to the crash received any type of administrative or disciplinary action. Critics of USAF's <b>safety</b> <b>record</b> stated that this crash was an example of a pattern of problems related to enforcement of safety procedures within USAF.|$|E

5|$|A {{particular}} {{influence was}} the speech made by President Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983 announcing the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) which, using ground-based and space-based systems, proposed protecting the United States from attack by nuclear missiles. One of {{the supporters of}} SDI was one-time US presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche, on whom Kennedy Martin based the character of Jerry Grogan, owner of the Fusion Corporation of Kansas. Kennedy Martin was also influenced by the culture of secrecy surrounding the UK's policy regarding nuclear power {{in light of the}} inquiry into the construction of the Sizewell B nuclear power station and the concerns about the <b>safety</b> <b>record</b> of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant; this led him to conceive International Irradiated Fuels and its chief executive Robert Bennett.|$|E
5|$|According to the Aviation Safety Network, Ethiopian Airlines records {{there have}} been 60 {{accidents}} and incidents since 1965, plus six more for Ethiopian Air Lines, the airline's former name. , these occurrences resulted in 337 deaths. One hijacking is the carrier's deadliest accident, when the plane plunged into the Indian Ocean due to fuel starvation in 1996. The second-deadliest accident occurred in 2010, when an aircraft crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, shortly after it departed Beirutâ€“Rafic Hariri International Airport, killing all 90 people on board. The crash of a Boeing 737-200 in 1988 led to 35 fatalities and ranks as the third most deadly accident experienced by the company. Despite this, Ethiopian Airlines has a good <b>safety</b> <b>record,</b> in contrast to other African airlines.|$|E
5|$|In October 2007, Time Magazine ran {{an article}} condemning the V-22 as unsafe, overpriced, and {{completely}} inadequate; the Marine Corps responded {{by arguing that}} parts of the article's data were dated, obsolete, inaccurate, and reflected expectations too high for any new field of aircraft. In 2011, it was reported by the controversial defense industry supported Lexington Institute that the average V-22 mishap rate per flight hour over the past 10 years was {{approximately half of the}} average accident rate for the USMC fleet; the V-22's accident rate was the lowest of any Marine rotorcraft. In 2011 Wired Magazine reported that the <b>safety</b> <b>record</b> was achieved by excluding ground incidents; the USMC responded that MV-22 reporting was to the same standards as other aircraft in the Department of the Navy.|$|E

5|$|It {{is largely}} an {{empirical}} procedure, {{and has a}} reasonable <b>safety</b> <b>record</b> {{within the scope of}} its intended application. Advantages are reduced overall decompression time and for some versions, easy estimation of decompression by the use of a simple rule-based procedure which can be done underwater by the diver. It requires the use of specific gas mixtures for given depth ranges. The advantages claimed are flexibility in that if the depth is not known accurately, the schedule can be adjusted during the dive to allow for the actual depth, and that it allows deep dives without the use of an expensive trimix dive computer.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 777 was {{introduced}} in 1994 and is generally regarded as having an excellent <b>safety</b> <b>record.</b> Since its first commercial flight in June 1995, the type has suffered only five other hull losses: British Airways Flight 38 in 2008; a cockpit fire in a parked EgyptAir Flight 667 at Cairo International Airport in 2011; the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 in 2013, in which three people died; and Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which was shot down over Ukraine with 298 people aboard in July 2014; in August 2016, the sixth hull-loss of the type occurred, when a 777-300 crashed while landing and caught fire at Dubai Airport {{at the end of}} its flight as Emirates Flight 521.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the short}} line to Chesham {{generally}} {{had a good}} <b>safety</b> <b>record,</b> despite its sharp curves and relatively steep gradient, it suffered two significant accidents in this period. On 19August 1909 the Aclass engine hauling the 7.53am train from Chesham broke an axle and derailed outside Chesham. There were no injuries but the track was blocked; a passenger service was maintained by operating shuttle services from {{each end of the}} branch to the crash site, where passengers were obliged to walk around the derailed engine to change trains. On 6November 1909 a backdraught from a locomotive firebox enveloped Robert Prior, the train's driver, in flames. (The type of locomotive is not recorded, but it is likely to have been a Metropolitan Railway D Class, which are known to have had a problem with backdraughts.) The locomotive's fireman managed to drive the train to Chesham, where Prior died from his injuries two days later. An inquest found that Prior had failed to turn on the blower, and a verdict of accidental death was recorded.|$|E
25|$|The Boeing 777, which entered {{commercial}} service on 7 June 1995, {{has one of}} the best <b>safety</b> <b>records</b> in commercial aircraft. In June 2014 there were about 1,212 aircraft in service, with 340 more on order.|$|R

50|$|The Pilot Record Improvement Act (PRIA) of 1996 was a United States {{federal law}} created in {{response}} to several fatal aviation accidents attributed to pilot error. Many of the accidents {{could have been avoided}} if the current operator was made aware of the pilot's past <b>safety</b> <b>records.</b> The act allows operators to see an applicant's flight qualifications and other <b>safety</b> related <b>records,</b> as provided by the FAA and the applicant's previous employers.|$|R
5|$|An Associate Professor of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, Stafford L. Warren, was {{commissioned}} as a {{colonel in the}} United States Army Medical Corps, and appointed as chief of the MED's Medical Section and Groves' medical advisor. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos. The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, {{but also for the}} MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its <b>safety</b> <b>record.</b> Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below the rate of private industry.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer <b>safety</b> <b>record,</b> such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria Airways had {{its heyday}} {{in the early}} 1980s, just before the {{departure}} of a KLM team that had been hired to make the airline efficient and profitable. At that time, its fleet consisted of about 30 aircraft, but the carrier was two years behind with its accounts {{to the extent that}} aircraft were acquired for cash. Owned or leased, the carrier operated a variety of aircraft during its history, including the Airbus A310, the Boeing 737, and the Douglas DC-10, of which it flew the last one ever built. Plagued by mis-management, corruption, and overstaffing, at the time of closure the airline had debts totalling , a poor <b>safety</b> <b>record,</b> and its operative fleet comprised a single aircraft flying domestic routes as well as two leased aircraft operating the international network. Nigeria Airways was succeeded by Virgin Nigeria, and the ground facilities were taken over by Arik Air.|$|E
