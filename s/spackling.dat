50|$|Phenolphthalein's pH {{sensitivity}} is exploited {{in other}} applications: Concrete has naturally high pH {{due to the}} calcium hydroxide formed when Portland cement reacts with water. As the concrete reacts with {{carbon dioxide in the}} atmosphere, pH decreases to 8.5-9. When a 1% phenolphthalein solution is applied to normal concrete, it turns bright pink. However, if it remains colorless, it shows that the concrete has undergone carbonation. In a similar application, <b>spackling</b> used to repair holes in drywall contains phenolphthalein. When applied, the basic <b>spackling</b> material retains a pink coloration; when the <b>spackling</b> has cured by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide, the pink color fades.|$|E

5000|$|Hammer {{paint is}} often used to beautify {{technical}} apparatus and not so commonly as a protective coating. The optical advantage of hammer paint is that surfaces look acceptable even if the underlying surface is not flat and smooth. To get a regular paint to look smooth the surface would have to be prepared first, for example by <b>spackling,</b> sanding, [...] grinding or polishing. With hammer paint, this step can be omitted. Some hammer paints (e.g. by Hammerite) are formulated to be usable directly on rusted steel without surface preparation other than brushing to remove the loose rust.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{bacteriophage}} T 4 e gene encodes lysozyme (e-lysozyme), which releases progeny phage after normal {{infection of}} Escherichia coli cells. A mutation in the <b>spackle</b> gene suppresses the defect in e-lysozyme (Emrich, 1968). The <b>spackle</b> gene was mapped between genes 41 and 61, but its precise location has not previously been determined. In the current study, we constructed an amber mutant of gene 61. 3, amST 14, by site-directed mutagenesis. The gene 61. 3 mutant shares phenotypes with <b>spackle</b> mutants: The amST 14 mutant forms large plaques with sharp edges and exhibits truncated lysis inhibition, and furthermore, the mutation can suppress the defect in e-lysozyme activity. In addition, cloned gene 61. 3 can rescue (by homologous recombination) {{as well as}} complement the S 12 mutation in the <b>spackle</b> gene. These results strongly suggest that gene 61. 3 is the <b>spackle</b> gene. Indeed, the S 12 mutant has one base deletion of five in a consecutive A tract in the gene 61. 3 coding region, substituting an unrelated 6 -amino acid sequence for the 9 C-terminal amino acids in the gene 61. 3 protein. The gene 61. 3 protein is predicted to localize in the periplasmic space after cleavage of a signal sequence...|$|R
5000|$|The term is a neologism, {{coined by}} Remy Sharp, who {{required}} {{a word that}} meant “replicate an API using JavaScript (or Flash or whatever) if the browser doesn’t have it natively” while co-writing the book Introducing HTML5 in 2009. [...] Formally, [...] "a shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment.", and polyfills exactly fit this definition; the term shim was also used for early polyfills, such as HTML5 Shiv.

[...] "His images are fresh and direct in part because he approaches industrial materials as if they were tubes of paint, feeling free to use anything as long as he uses it directly, in the form in which he finds it."

[...] “My father was a physical person", he explained, [...] "I just felt most comfortable making things and moving things.

40|$|Motivated by {{issues at}} a {{manufacturer}} of customized- and standard messenger bags, we develop an iterative two-stage framework (involving marketing and operations models) to determine {{the conditions under which}} a firm benefits from production <b>spackling.</b> With <b>spackling,</b> the firm uses flexible capacity to produce custom products as demanded each period, and then fills in, or spackles, the production schedule with make-to-stock output of standard products to restock inventory. <b>Spackling</b> broadly addresses market preferences, while mitigating the effects of "bumpy" demand for custom products by smoothing production, thereby improving capacity utilization as compared to a focused approach, where standard items are made with efficient capacity and custom products with flexible capacity. The marketing model employs logit-based choice and, given product costs and customer preferences, identifies optimal pricing, expected demand, and demand variability. Interestingly, we find that, under certain assumptions, the firm should price all products to achieve a constant absolute dollar markup. The resultant demand parameters are fed into an operations model, which specifies optimal efficient and flexible capacities (and decides between <b>spackling</b> and focus), thereby determining product costs, which are fed back into the marketing model to solve iteratively. That is, we link operations decisions regarding capacity to marketing decisions regarding price, and vice-versa. We examine conditions under which convergence of the two models is achieved, and illustrate our framework with data from the messenger bag manufacturer...|$|E

40|$|We present Resource <b>Spackling,</b> a {{framework}} for integrating register allocation and instruction scheduling {{that is based on}} a Measure and Reduce paradigm. The technique first measures the resource requirements of a program and then uses these measurements to distribute code for better resource allocation. The technique is general in that it is applicable to both local and global scheduling and the allocation of different types of resources. A program's resource requirements for both register and functional unit resources are first measured using a unified representation. These measurements are used to find areas where resources are either under-utilized or over-utilized, called resource holes and excessive sets, respectively. Conditions are determined for increasing resource utilization in the resource holes. A local scheduler that moves sets of instructions into resource holes to reduce the excessive sets for all resources is presented. We develop a global scheduling algorithm that mo [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} assessed children 2 ̆ 7 s {{interpretations of}} novel words applied to nonsolid substances. In particular, {{the principle of}} mutual exclusivity was tested. This principle holds that, if a child already knows a label for an object, then a new label for that object should be rejected. The present research extended {{the study of the}} mutual exclusivity principle to children 2 ̆ 7 s acquisition of words for nonsolid substances and tested for age-related changes in children 2 ̆ 7 s reliance upon mutual exclusivity. ^ In Experiment 1, 48 children between 3 and 5 years viewed substances that were either familiar (e. g., playdoh) or unfamiliar (e. g., <b>spackling</b> compound). Each substance possessed some distinctive property (e. g., glitter) and was referenced with a novel word. A forced choice assessment was made of whether the children interpreted the novel word as a name for a substance or its distinctive property. Children extended novel words to the distinctive property more often in the familiar than in the unfamiliar condition. This result is consistent with the principle of mutual exclusivity. ^ Experiment 2 was a more stringent test of the mutual exclusivity principle. As in Experiment 1, 48 children between 3 and 5 years viewed substances that were either familiar or unfamiliar. Again, each substance possessed some distinctive property and was referenced with a novel word. An assessment using sequential presentation was made of whether the children were willing to extend the novel word to the substance, the distinctive property, both substance and property, or neither. In the familiar substance condition, children extended novel words more to the distinctive property than to the substance. In the unfamiliar substance condition, children extended novel words more to the substance than to the distinctive property. These patterns are those predicted by mutual exclusivity. However, in Experiment 2 {{there was no evidence that}} the youngest preschoolers used the mutual exclusivity assumption, and the strongest evidence occurred in the oldest age group tested. The results were discussed in terms of age-related changes in children 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on the mutual exclusivity principle and directions for further research. ...|$|E
