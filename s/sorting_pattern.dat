5000|$|The genus Dictyostelium is in {{the order}} Dictyosteliida, the {{so-called}} cellular slime molds or social amoebae. In turn the order {{is in the}} infraphylum Mycetozoa. Members of the order are Protista of great theoretical interest in biology because they have aspects of both unicellularity and multicellularity. The individual cells in their independent phase are common on organic detritus or in damp soils and caves. In this phase they are amoebae. Typically, the amoebal cells grow separately and wander independently, feeding mainly on bacteria. However, they interact to form multi-cellular structures following starvation. Groups of up to about 100,000 cells signal each other by releasing chemoattractants such as cyclic AMP (cAMP) or glorin. They then coalesce by chemotaxis to form an aggregate that becomes surrounded by an extracellular matrix. The aggregate forms a fruiting body, with cells differentiating individually into different components of the final structure. In some species, the whole aggregate may move collectively - forming a structure known as a grex or [...] "slug" [...] - before finally forming a fruiting body. Basic processes of development such as differential cell <b>sorting,</b> <b>pattern</b> formation, stimulus-induced gene expression, and cell-type regulation are common to Dictyostelium and metazoans. For further detail see family Dictyostelid.|$|E

Sixty Australian construction professionals participated in the research, including 15 architects, 15 engineers, 15 constructors and 15 OHS professionals. Participants were asked to sort photographs depicting different building systems into a grid based upon their judgement of the likelihood of accidental injury resulting from the construction of each of the building systems depicted. Responses ranged from Rare (- 2) to Almost certain (+ 2). Sorting patterns relating to eight photographs of different façade systems were analysed using Q factor analysis. Three distinct <b>sorting</b> <b>pattern</b> types were identified in the data, representing clusters of participants whose sorting patterns were similar. These <b>sorting</b> <b>pattern</b> types cut across occupational/professional groups. Interpretation of the factors revealed substantial differences between the OHS judgements made by participants in the three clusters. Qualitative explanatory information revealed participants in the three clusters used different attributes when considering the likelihood of accidental injury. These attributes shaped their sorting patterns. The results suggest shared mental models (SMMs) are unlikely to exist in construction project teams, as each individual uses their own frame of reference to understand OHS. Opportunities exist to understand these different frames of reference and create more consistent team mental models of OHS. However, incorporating a diversity of viewpoints into project decision-making is recommended in order to produce effective decision-making in the choice or specification of building systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{dopamine}} transporter (DAT) mediates reuptake of released dopamine and is {{the target}} for psychostimulants, such as cocaine and amphetamine. DAT undergoes marked constitutive endocytosis, but {{little is known about}} the fate and sorting of the endocytosed transporter. To study DAT sorting in cells lines, we fused the one-transmembrane segment protein Tac to DAT, thereby generating a transporter (TacDAT) with an extracellular antibody epitope suited for trafficking studies. TacDAT was functional and endocytosed constitutively in HEK 293 cells. According to an ELISA-based assay, TacDAT intracellular accumulation was increased by the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin and by monensin, an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation and recycling. Monensin also reduced TacDAT surface expression consistent with partial recycling. In both HEK 293 cells and in the dopaminergic cell line 1 Rb 3 An 27, constitutively internalized TacDAT displayed primary co-localization with the late endosomal marker Rab 7, less co-localization with the “short loop” recycling marker Rab 4, and little co-localization with the marker of “long loop” recycling endosomes, Rab 11. Removal by mutation of N-terminal ubiquitination sites did not affect this <b>sorting</b> <b>pattern.</b> The <b>sorting</b> <b>pattern</b> was distinct from a bona fide recycling membrane protein, the β 2 -adrenergic receptor, that co-localized primarily with Rab 11 and Rab 4. Constitutively internalized wild type DAT probed with the fluorescently tagged cocaine analogue JHC 1 - 64, exhibited the same co-localization pattern as TacDAT in 1 Rb 3 An 27 cells and in cultured midbrain dopaminergic neurons.
