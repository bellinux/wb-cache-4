500|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of PCD (2005), {{and over the}} course of two years (2005–07), Scherzinger recorded 75-100 songs for Her Name Is Nicole, her planned solo debut album. [...] Her work as lead singer furthered Scherzinger's popularity as she began work on her own music. She stated that she enjoyed collaborating with many different artists, and that although she had been writing songs for over ten years, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she was at a different level while working with such A-list writers and producers. Following the moderate success of [...] "Baby Love", the complete lack of success of the singles such as [...] "Whatever U Like" [...] and numerous push backs, Scherzinger decided to put the release of the on hold. She then returned her focus back on the Pussycat Dolls, and recording commenced for their second studio album. Scherzinger cited that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the songs were more suited as a Pussycat Dolls song than her own.|$|E
2500|$|She {{regretted that}} she had to give up journalism, and could only write about {{tradition}} and culture. In her articles collected later into [...] "Mother's Words of Old", she bemoaned the loosening of social cohesion, morals, and traditional values in dress and manner which she blamed on economic disorder, consumerism and globalisation, and Chinese immigration. She once wrote that the Chinese had occupied Mandalay without firing a shot, and had dubbed the present Lawpan [...] (boss in Chinese) era; <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Mandalay was an undeclared colony of Yunnan Province. Daw Amar was a staunch defender of Burmese history, culture, religion and sovereignty embodied in her birthplace, the last royal capital of Burma, Mandalay - thus broadly nationalistic, religious and ethnocentric traditionalist in her perspective, and yet she had been in the forefront of modernising the written language, fostering mutual understanding and friendship between the dominant Bamar and the ethnic minorities in tandem with her husband, promoting sex education and public awareness of the HIV/AIDS problem, and voicing complaints regarding unpaid labour contributions of women in society.|$|E
2500|$|... “At first I had {{no desire}} to write screenplays. I kind of wished I had because I was {{reaching}} the end of my time producing music videos. I was struggling so hard {{to figure out what it}} was that I was supposed to be doing. I kept thinking I’m supposed to be doing something creative. I can’t believe I have such a knack for the vernacular and I don’t have anywhere to apply it." [...] “I felt I had not found my true path. And then a series of events occurred that led me to the point where I didn’t have anything to lose if I wrote a screenplay." [...] She began writing sitcoms with a comedian friend but was plagued by second thoughts about her work. Khouri was frustrated and kept [...] "contemplating and meditating" [...] until she got this idea of [...] "two women going on a crime spree." [...] <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a light bulb had gone on over her head, making her more interested in the idea.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dalton roused herself. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> breathless, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had been}} carried along at an unusual pace.|$|R
60|$|She tied up the packet, {{and held}} it in her hand, meditating over it. <b>She</b> half <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if,</b> in opening it, she had {{violated}} a confidence.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{make little}} {{mistakes}} {{of a century}} or two,' Laura Wing remarked, laughing. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> now <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had known Mr. Wendover a long time.|$|R
2500|$|In February 1996, Gordeeva {{returned}} to the ice, this time as a solo performer. Her first solo performance was a tribute to her late husband, skated to the 'Adagietto' section of Gustav Mahler's 'Symphony No. 5'. The number was publicly performed only twice, first at a preview performance at the Minto Skating Club in Ottawa Ontario, [...] and then on February 27, 1996, in a televised tribute to Grinkov, called [...] "Celebration of a Life", in which numerous skating luminaries took part. Gordeeva has said that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she skated with Sergei that night, that she was [...] "double strong" [...] because she felt him with her. The same year, {{with the aid of}} author E. M. Swift, she told her story in a book titled [...] In February 1998, CBS aired an eponymous docudrama based on the book. She published a second book in April 1998, titled A Letter for Daria. In 1998, she told an interviewer that [...] "My life of great skating, and skating with him, is over, ... I don't try to go now for Olympics. I take skating for a job." ...|$|E
2500|$|One Ojibwa {{woman from}} the far western end of Lake Superior, Oshahgushkodanaqua, who married in 1793 John Johnston, a British fur trader based in Sault St. Marie working for the North West Company, later gave an account in her old age of how she came {{to be married to}} a British writer named Anna Brownell Jameson. According to Jameson's 1838 book Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada, Oshahgushkodanaqua told her when she was 13, she {{embarked}} on her [...] "vision quest" [...] to find her guardian spirit by fasting alone in a lodge painted black on a high hill. During Oshahgushkodanaqua's [...] "vision quest": [...] "She dreamed continually of a white man, who approached her with a cup in his hand, saying [...] "Poor thing! Why are you punishing yourself? Why do you fast? Here is food for you!" [...] He was always accompanied by a dog, who looked up at her like he knew her. Also, she dreamed of being on a high hill, which was surrounded by water, and from which she beheld many canoes full of Indians, coming to her and paying her homage; after this, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she was being carried up into the heavens, and as she looked down on the earth, she perceived it was on fire and said to herself, [...] "All my relations will be burned!", but a voice answered and said, [...] "No, they will not be destroyed, they will be saved!", and she knew it was a spirit, because the voice was not human. She fasted for ten days, during which time her grandmother brought her at intervals some water. When satisfied that she had obtained a guardian spirit in the white stranger who haunted her dreams, she returned to her father's lodge". About five years later, Oshahgushkodanaqua first met Johnston, who asked to marry her, but was refused permission by her father who did not think he wanted a long-term relationship. When Johnston returned the next year and again asked to marry Oshahgushkodanaqua, her father granted permission, but she herself declined, saying she disliked the implications of being married until death, but ultimately married under strong pressure from her father. Oshahgushkodanaqua came to embrace her marriage when she decided that Johnston was the white stranger she saw in her dreams during her vision quest. The couple stayed married for 36 years with the marriage ending with Johnston's death, and Oshahgushkodanaqua {{played an important role in}} her husband's business career. Jameson also noted Oshahgushkodanaqua was considered to be a strong woman among the Ojibwa, writing [...] "in her youth she hunted and was accounted the surest eye and fleetest foot among the women of her tribe".|$|E
60|$|Olivia frowned. She was not jealous, but {{sometimes}} <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Jacinta's popularity swamped hers.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite {{held her}} breath. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> now <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the whole {{universe}} must stand still during the next supreme moment, until she had heard what Chauvelin's next words would be.|$|R
60|$|Gudrun envied {{him almost}} painfully. Even this {{momentary}} possession of pure isolation and fluidity {{seemed to her}} so terribly desirable that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> herself <b>as</b> <b>if</b> damned, {{out there on the}} high-road.|$|R
60|$|Catherine blushed, for <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{they were}} making sport of her. What {{in the world could}} this {{beautiful}} young man have said? He looked at her still, in spite of her blush; but very kindly and respectfully.|$|R
60|$|But to {{this the}} girl gave no reply. Indeed, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> any word now might choke her.|$|E
60|$|Carol {{was so much}} {{pleased that}} <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she must talk to somebody, so she turned to Ruth.|$|E
60|$|As Theodora {{moved her}} stately neck <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a thunder-bolt had fallen; but the gentleman's manner was {{particularly}} pleasing.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} flaming hours of wonder, {{she did not}} know what <b>she</b> <b>felt.</b> <b>She</b> was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> tied to the stake. The flames were licking her and devouring her. But the flames were also good. They seemed to wear her away to rest. What <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> in her heart and her womb {{she did not know}}. It was a kind of swoon.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are other}} people in the world besides the Colonel," [...] Ermine began to say, though <b>she</b> hardly <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there were, and at any rate a sense of rescue crossed her. The persons {{admitted}} took them equally by surprise, being Conrade Temple and Mr. Keith.|$|R
6000|$|... "Margaret, {{you hurt}} me!" [...] he exclaimed, suddenly. In the {{intensity}} of the emotion excited by what she had discovered, her finger-nails had nearly penetrated through his skin. <b>She</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would hold him and hold him forever, but she released his hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> even Leonard's death {{could be}} {{accepted}} thankfully as the captive's release. But that sorrow was spared her.|$|E
60|$|But {{she walked}} away from him. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had trapped her. He was angry and depressed, he felt again despised.|$|E
60|$|Try as she might, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she had had}} a blow which {{knocked her}} down. She felt {{she had had a}} blow.|$|E
60|$|Then she paused. The cry {{of welcome}} died on her lips, leaving them dry and parted. <b>She</b> {{suddenly}} <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> some fearful talons had gripped {{her heart and}} were tearing at it with sharp, long nails; the blood flew from her cheeks and from her limbs, leaving her {{with a sense of}} icy numbness.|$|R
60|$|Something {{made the}} girl look at Treherne. He stood gazing, {{his head a}} little bent, {{and one of his}} black elf-locks had fallen forward over his forehead. And again she had the sense of a shadow over the grass; <b>she</b> almost <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the grass were a host of fairies, and that the fairies were not her friends.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> {{no shame}} at her present miserable appearance; she was past {{personal}} pride. <b>She</b> hardly <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the tall, strong girl, attractive with health and hope, {{could be the}} same soul as the woman who now sat in utter despair listening to the heavy breathing of the happy cows, grateful for the relief from their burden of milk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] murmured Ursula, {{under her}} breath and without {{attempting}} to move, for <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> her knees would give way under her.|$|E
60|$|She stopped, quivering. Betty {{was cold}} with a nameless dismay. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were {{standing}} in the dark on the brink of an abyss.|$|E
60|$|Virginia trembled, a cold shudder {{ran through}} her, {{and for a}} few moments there was silence. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she was in a terrible dream.|$|E
60|$|Thoughtfully the Jew {{rubbed his}} dirty chin. Marguerite's {{heart was beating}} well-nigh to bursting. She had heard the {{peremptory}} question; she looked anxiously at the Jew, but could not read his face beneath the shadow of his broad-brimmed hat. Vaguely <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> somehow <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he held Percy's fate in his long dirty hands.|$|R
60|$|Through all {{the rather}} long walk, Clara still kept close to her, telling who every one was, and talking incessantly, till <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> almost confused, and {{longed for the}} {{quietness}} of the church. Mr. Lyddell's pew was a high, square box, curtained round, with a table and a stove, so that <b>she</b> hardly <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was in church, and she was surprised not to see Elliot Lyddell there.|$|R
60|$|But {{later on}} in the night, milor--her milor, as she soon got to call him--came and talked so beautifully that <b>she,</b> poor girl, <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> no music could ever sound quite so sweetly in her ear.|$|R
6000|$|... "There 's {{philosophy}} for you," [...] said Polly, smiling, {{even while}} <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> adversity {{was going to}} do more for Tom than years of prosperity.|$|E
60|$|When she {{had signed}} and sealed this letter <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she had torn out {{a chapter of}} her young life and thrown it upon the fire.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not till}} Sunday that Lilias {{felt as if}} she could ever be comforted. Her heart was indeed ready to break as she walked {{at the head of the}} school {{children}} behind the white-covered coffin, and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she did not deserve to dwell upon the child's present happiness; but afterwards she was relieved by joining in prayer for the pardon of our sins and negligences, and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she was forgiven, at least by man, when she joined with Mrs. Eden in the appointed feast of Easter Day.|$|E
50|$|On August 15, 2016, lead vocalist Kristen May {{announced}} her {{departure from the}} band, citing a growing desire {{to stay at home}} with her family and that <b>she</b> never really <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was part of the band.|$|R
50|$|Zard's most {{successful}} single, Makenaide (負けないで) {{has been used}} as a theme song for Nippon Television program 24-hour TV, an annual Japanese television programming in which a celebrity host is on screen continually for a whole day. Sakai said that she was honored and looked forward to watching 24-hour TV. She also said that since Makenaide was widely appreciated by the public, <b>she</b> often <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> that song was not hers to keep.|$|R
60|$|For {{the pure}} and pious child had heard {{enough of the}} words of these men, as she walked behind them, to fill her with horror. She had never before heard an oath, but there came back from these men coarse, brutal tones and words of blasphemy that froze her blood with horror. And Moses was going with them! <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> somehow <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they must be a company of fiends bearing him to his ruin.|$|R
