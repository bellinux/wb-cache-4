2500|$|On September 24, 2002 in {{downtown}} Minneapolis, Minnesota, Moss was driving and {{was preparing to}} make an illegal turn. A traffic control officer (Amy Zaccardi), noticing {{what he was about}} to do, stood in front of his 2002 Lexus car, ordering him to stop. Eyewitness accounts of the event differ at this point, but Moss did not comply with the officer's order, and she was bumped by his vehicle and fell to the ground. Moss was arrested, and a search of his vehicle revealed a joint amounting to less than a gram of marijuana in his ashtray. Initially charged with felony Suspicion of Assault with a Deadly Weapon and a misdemeanor marijuana possession, Moss spent the night in jail and was released the following morning. [...] Moss pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor traffic violation and was ordered to pay a $1,200 fine and perform 40 hours of community service.

50|$|Examples of defined {{contribution}} {{plans in}} the USA include Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans. In such plans, the employee is responsible, to one degree or another, for selecting the types of investments toward which the funds in the retirement plan are allocated. This may range from choosing one of {{a small number of}} pre-determined mutual funds to selecting individual stocks or other securities. Most self-directed retirement plans are characterized by certain tax advantages, and some provide for a portion of the employee's contributions to be matched by the employer.

5000|$|Returns of {{your regular}} {{contributions}} from your Roth IRA(s) are always withdrawn tax and penalty-free. Eligible (tax and penalty-free) distributions of earnings must fulfill two requirements. First, the seasoning period {{of five years}} since {{the opening of the}} Roth IRA account must have elapsed, and secondly a justification must exist such as retirement or disability. The simplest justification is reaching 59.5 years of age, at which point qualified withdrawals may be made in any amount on any schedule. Becoming disabled or being a [...] "first time" [...] home buyer can provide justification for limited qualified withdrawals. Finally, although one can take distributions from a Roth IRA under the substantially equal periodic payments (SEPP) rule without paying a 10% penalty, any interest earned in the IRA will be subject to tax—a <b>substantial</b> <b>penalty</b> which forfeits the primary tax benefits of the Roth IRA.|$|E

5000|$|Nunn-Lugar {{established}} the Defense Enterprise Fund (DEF) as a self-sustaining {{venture capital fund}} that would create profitable joint ventures with former Russian WMD production enterprises agreeing to convert from production of WMD to peaceful businesses.In July 1999, a DEF employee, Matthew Maly, a US citizen, sent a confidential letter of concern to the US Department of State claiming that up to $20M may have been mismanaged or stolen from DEF by its American top management. 5Maly's allegations were supported by an August, 2000 DoD audit. The audit revealed that the fund's original $67 million was then worth around $31 million, that mismanagement was widespread, and that no plan for sustainability had been developed or implemented.6 DEF was eventually closed, with its entire $67M grant apparently lost.DEF originally claimed to have employed 3,370 former Soviet WMD scientists. Maly disputed this figure, claiming that no more than 200 of them could have been employed. After an article in Defense Week, the figure was reduced to 1,250, but Maly kept the pressure on, until the figure was reduced to [...] "there has been a clerical error".As an officer of DEF, Maly was required by his contract with the US government to report abuses. Indeed the contract had very <b>substantial</b> <b>penalty</b> provisions for failing to do so. And yet, Maly was fired, blacklisted, and his accounts were frozen worldwide for nine months, until the Defense Week article.Another aspect of DEF was that DEF was actually trying to strengthen Russian military capabilities with the US taxpayers money. For example, DEF was trying to build in Russia the most advanced microchip plant in the world (a $200M project).|$|E

40|$|This article {{concerns}} {{the use of}} village intermediaries to mitigate asymmetric information problems in rural credit delivery. We consider an example from Senegal and examine the intermediaries' screening of loan applicants. The results show that, when the intermediaries expected to incur a <b>substantial</b> <b>penalty</b> {{in the event of}} borrower default, they engaged in appropriate screening, allocating credit to borrowers likely to repay their loans. When the default penalty was lowered, however, the intermediaries engaged in opportunistic screening, emphasising political affiliation and consanguinity in their lending decisions. These results reveal both the potential efficacy of village intermediaries in allocating credit and their extreme sensitivy to penalty regimes. ...|$|E

To improve the power in this setting, a number of authors have considered using weighted p-values, with the motivation often based upon the scientific plausibility of the hypotheses. We review this literature, derive optimal weights and show that the power is remarkably robust to misspecification of these weights. We consider two methods for choosing weights in practice. The first, external weighting, is based on prior information. The second, estimated weighting, uses the data to choose weights.

40|$|Many new {{high-performance}} microprocessor {{designs are}} incorporating much shorter clocks, deeper pipelines and increased support for multiple instruction issue.

40|$|Abstract. Memory address traces are an {{important}} information source; they drive memory simulations for performance modeling, systems design and application tuning. For long running applications, the direct use of an address trace is complicated by its size. Previous attempts to reduce trace size incurred a <b>substantial</b> <b>penalty</b> with respect to trace accuracy. We propose a novel method of memory profiling that enables the generation of highly accurate synthetic traces with space requirements typically under 1 % of the original traces. We demonstrate the synthetic trace accuracy in terms of cache hit rates, spatial-temporal locality scores and locality surfaces. Simulated cache hit rates from synthetic traces are within 3. 5 % of observed and on average are within 1. 0 % for L 1 cache. Our profiles are on average 60 times smaller than compressed traces. The combination of small profile sizes and high similarity to original traces makes our technique uniquely applicable to performance modeling and trace driven simulation of large-scale parallel scientific applications. ...|$|E
40|$|We track faculty for 30 yr at five PhD-granting {{departments}} of economics. Two-thirds of faculty who take alternative employment move downward; less than one-quarter moves upward. We find a <b>substantial</b> <b>penalty</b> for seniority, even after richly controlling for faculty productivity, and the penalty is little changed when we allow wages {{and returns to}} seniority to differ by mobility status. Faculty who end up moving to better or comparable positions were penalized as severely for seniority {{while they were in}} our sample as faculty who stay. These results are incompatible with the raiding hypothesis. Faculty from top 10 programs are also punished for seniority but to a lesser degree than other faculty, which could reflect reduced monopsony power against such faculty if they are more marketable. All results persist when we control for prospective publications and allow lower returns for older publications. Match-quality bias has dissipated in the post-internet period, which may be the consequence of greater availability of information.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the tax penalty on volatile personal income under progressive tax rates. The phenomenon {{may have an}} effect on long-term entrepreneurial decisions as well as risky occupational choice. An options-based model is used to estimate the expected effective rate due from tax-payers at different income levels and volatilities under the current Czech legislation. A comparison is made to the system which has been in place until 2005, {{as well as to the}} Slovak flat-rate schedule. The model shows that volatile incomes incur a <b>substantial</b> <b>penalty</b> of up to 2 percentage points on the effective rate peaking just below the official income statistics mean. The effect is more pronounced than under the former parameters of the tax code. A severe impact on below-average earners due to the mandatory minimum tax-base regulation has been demonstrated. On the other hand, the Slovak flat tax with a single marginal rate bears virtually no sensitivity to income volatility, with the slight exception of very low incomes. income tax, option model, tax rate progression, personal income, income volatility, risk-taking, occupational choice...|$|E
40|$|A rocket engine's {{combustion}} chamber {{is lined with}} material that is highly conductive to heat in order to dissipate the huge thermal load (evident in a white-hot exhaust plume). Because of its thermal conductivity copper is the best choice of liner material. However, the mechanical properties of pure copper are inadequate to withstand the high stresses, hence, copper alloys are needed in this application. But copper and its alloys are prone to oxidation and related damage, especially "blanching" (an oxidation-reduction mode of degradation). The space shuttle main engine {{combustion chamber}} is lined with a Cu-Ag-Zr alloy, "NARloy-Z", which exhibits blanching.

40|$|Conviction {{rates are}} high in Japan. Why? First, Japanese {{prosecutors}} are badly understaffed. Able to bring only their strongest cases, they could be presenting judges only with the most obviously guilty defendants. High conviction rates would then follow naturally. Crucially, however, {{this is not the}} full story, for Japanese judges face seriously biased incentives. A judge who acquits a defendant runs significant risks of hurting his career and earns scant hope of positive payoffs. Using data on the careers and published opinions of 321 Japanese judges (all judges who published an opinion in a criminal case in 1976 or 1979), we find skewed incentives to convict. First, a judge who – trying a defendant alone- – acquits a defendant will spend during the next decade an extra year and a half in branch office assignments. Second, a judge who acquits a defendant but finds the acquittal reversed on appeal will spend an extra three years in branch offices. Conversely, a judge who finds a conviction reversed incurs no <b>substantial</b> <b>penalty.</b> Unfortunately for innocent suspects, the absence of an unbiased judiciary also reduces the incentives Japanese prosecutors have to prosecute only the most obviously guilty defendants...|$|E
