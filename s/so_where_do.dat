5000|$|All this {{familiar}} {{story is}} true, but it leaves out an irony. Bohr's version {{of quantum mechanics}} was deeply flawed, {{but not for the}} reason Einstein thought. The Copenhagen interpretation describes what happens when an observer makes a measurement, but the observer and the act of measurement are themselves treated classically. This is surely wrong: Physicists and their apparatus must be governed by the same quantum mechanical rules that govern everything else in the universe. But these rules are expressed in terms of a wave function (or, more precisely, a state vector) that evolves in a perfectly deterministic way. <b>So</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> the probabilistic rules of the Copenhagen interpretation come from?Considerable {{progress has been made in}} recent years toward the resolution of the problem, which I cannot go into here. It is enough to say that neither Bohr nor Einstein had focused on the real problem with quantum mechanics. The Copenhagen rules clearly work, so they have to be accepted. But this leaves the task of explaining them by applying the deterministic equation for the evolution of the wave function, the Schrödinger equation, to observers and their apparatus.|$|E

40|$|The views {{expressed}} in this paper {{are those of the}} authors and do not necessarily represent those of the BOT. This paper attempts to answer two questions arising in the present environment where traditional inflation indicators show no clear sign of price pressure despite robust economic growth. Firstly, are there any price pressures at present and, if <b>so,</b> <b>where</b> <b>do</b> they lie? Secondly, with several changes in the global and domestic environment, has the inflation process, in particular its speed of adjustment, changed? Both the newly proposed Kalman’s inflation indicator, which has a unique feature of time-varying weights, and the finding of relatively higher increase in PPI compared to CPI indicates some upward price pressure in the economy. Meanwhile, sectoral price data reveal that prices of consumer goods have been adjusted less frequently across sectors during the post-crisis period although there has been no change in the frequency of producer price adjustment. Inflation is also found to return quickly to its initial level in response to shocks. This result renders an undemanding role of monetary policy especially under the inflation targeting regime...|$|E

The risk of critical thresholds in the climate system being crossed where some irre-versible qualitative change sets in (such as a major ocean circulation change) is taken increasingly seriously in the discussion on anthropogenic climate change.
