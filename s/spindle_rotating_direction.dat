40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{magnetic}} field on the unsteady flow over a stretching surface in a rotating fluid has been studied. The unsteadiness in the flow field {{is due to the}} time-dependent variation of the velocity of the stretching surface and the angular velocity of the rotating fluid. The Navier-Stokes equations and the energy equation governing the flow and the heat transfer admit a self-similar solution if the velocity of the stretching surface and the angular velocity of the rotating fluid vary inversely as a linear function of time. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations is solved numerically using a shooting method. The rotation parameter causes flow reversal in the component of the velocity parallel to the strerching surface and the magnetic field tends to prevent or delay the flow reversal. The surface shear stresses dong the stretching surface and in the <b>rotating</b> <b>direction</b> increase with the rotation parameter, but the surface heat transfer decreases. On the other hand, the magnetic field increases the surface shear stress along the stretching surface, but reduces the surface shear stress in the <b>rotating</b> <b>direction</b> and the surface heat transfer. The {{effect of the}} unsteady parameter is more pronounced on the velocity profiles in the <b>rotating</b> <b>direction</b> and temperature profiles...|$|R

50|$|A {{differential}} screw is {{a mechanism}} used for making small, precise {{adjustments to the}} spacing between two objects (such as in focusing a microscope, moving the anvils of a micrometer, or positioning optics). A differential screw uses a spindle with two screw threads of differing leads (aka thread pitch), and possibly opposite handedness, on which two nuts move. As the <b>spindle</b> <b>rotates,</b> {{the space between the}} nuts changes based on the difference between the threads. These mechanisms allow extremely small adjustments using commonly available screws. A differential screw mechanism using two nuts incurs higher friction and therefore requires more torque to turn than a simple, single lead screw with an equivalent pitch.|$|R

D.), Washington State UniversityManaging crop load of {{commercial}} tree fruit species, such as sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.), apple (Malus domestica Borkh.), pear (Pyrus communis), by thinning bloom, {{is a common}} practice used to produce larger and better quality fruit. Targeted mechanical thinning may be preferential compared to current chemical and manual strategies and decrease production costs. This study aimed to develop a hand-held mechanical thinning device suitable for targeted thinning blossoms on sweet cherry trees regardless of tree architecture. Research prototypes of different configurations have been designed, fabricated, and tested in laboratory and in orchards. Field testing results from both research and commercial orchards verified the efficacy of these prototypes as blossom thinners - flowers were removed effectively {{with a range of}} configurations. I conducted a parametric study that investigated a range of configurations for thinning spindle evaluating the torque, speed variation and power consumption under laboratory conditions based on a developed platform and data acquisition system, which simulated different blossom thinning conditions in the orchard and let desired parameters measurable. Power consumption and torque variation to string stiffness were obtained to provide crucial information assisting motor and battery sizing for product commercialization. Another parametric study for evaluating flower removal percentage in relation to a set of key operation parameters - <b>spindle</b> <b>rotating</b> speed, swiping speed and thinning distance - was conducted in sweet cherry orchard. Results indicated that stiffness of thinning strings affected the controllability of flower removal percentage. Flower removal percentage could be better controlled when strings that were less rigid were utilized.
