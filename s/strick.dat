5|$|Burton {{originally}} did {{not want}} to direct another Batman film. Warner Bros. developed a script with Sam Hamm which had the Penguin and Catwoman going after hidden treasure. Burton agreed to return after they granted him more creative control and replaced Hamm with Daniel Waters. Wesley <b>Strick</b> did an uncredited rewrite, removing Harvey Dent and Robin and rewriting the climax. Annette Bening was originally cast as Catwoman but became pregnant and was replaced with Pfeiffer. Filming began in June 1991 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.|$|E
5|$|By 1956, she {{was working}} on films as well. Her first credit as a sound editor was for Fritz Lang's While the City Sleeps. She worked on the {{experimental}} documentary The Savage Eye (1959); the co-directors Ben Maddow, Sidney Meyers, and Joseph <b>Strick</b> and the other connections she made on this film were important to her subsequent career. In 1962 Fields won the Motion Picture Sound Editors' Golden Reel Award for the film El Cid (directed by Anthony Mann).|$|E

25|$|Several of Genet's plays {{were adapted}} into films. The Balcony (1963), {{directed}} by Joseph <b>Strick,</b> starred Shelley Winters as Madame Irma, Peter Falk, Lee Grant and Leonard Nimoy. The Maids was filmed in 1974 and starred Glenda Jackson, Susannah York and Vivien Merchant. Italian director Salvatore Samperi in 1986 directed another adaptation for {{film of the}} same play, La Bonne (Eng.Corruption), starring Florence Guerin and Katrine Michelsen.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{a remake}} was released, also titled A Nightmare on Elm Street, {{starring}} Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger. The film {{was produced by}} Michael Bay, directed by Samuel Bayer and written by the team of Wesley <b>Strick</b> and Eric Heisserer. The film {{was intended as a}} reboot to the franchise, but plans for a sequel never came to fruition after the film received mostly negative reviews.|$|E
500|$|Burton hired Wesley <b>Strick</b> {{to do an}} uncredited rewrite. <b>Strick</b> recalled, [...] "When I {{was hired}} to write Batman Returns (Batman II at the time), the big problem of the script was Penguin's lack of a 'master plan'." [...] Warner Bros. {{presented}} <b>Strick</b> with warming, or freezing Gotham City, a plot point they would later use in Batman & Robin. <b>Strick</b> gained inspiration from a Moses parallel that had Penguin killing the firstborn sons of Gotham. A similar notion was used when the Penguin's parents threw him into a river as a baby. Robin appeared in the script, but was deleted because Waters felt the film had too many characters. Waters called Robin [...] "the most worthless character in the world, especially with [...] the loner of loners." [...] Robin {{started out as a}} juvenile gang leader, who becomes an ally to Batman. Robin was later changed to a black teenage garage mechanic. Waters explained, [...] "He's wearing this old-fashioned garage mechanic uniform and it has an 'R' on it. He drives the Batmobile, which I notice they used in the third film!" [...] Marlon Wayans was cast, and signed for a sequel. The actor had attended a wardrobe fitting, but it was decided to save the character for a third installment.|$|E

500|$|Filming was {{originally}} {{set to begin}} in early 1998. In the summer of 1997, Superman Lives entered pre-production, with an art department employed under production designer Rick Heinrichs. Burton hired Wesley <b>Strick</b> to rewrite Smith's script. Smith was disappointed, stating, [...] "The studio was happy with what I was doing. Then Tim Burton got involved, and when he signed his pay-or-play deal, {{he turned around and}} said he wanted to do his version of Superman. So who is Warner Bros. going back to? The guy who made Clerks, or the guy who made them half a billion dollars on Batman?" [...] When <b>Strick</b> read Smith's script, he was annoyed with the fact that [...] "Superman was accompanied/shadowed by someone/something called the Eradicator." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brainiac's evil plot of launching a disk in space to block out the sun and make Superman powerless was reminiscent of an episode of The Simpsons, with Mr. Burns doing the Brainiac role." [...] However, after reading The Death and Return of Superman, <b>Strick</b> was able to understand some of the elements of Smith's script. Strick's rewrite featured Superman as an existentialist, thinking of himself to be an outsider on Earth. Superman is threatened by Brainiac and Lex Luthor, who later amalgamate into [...] "Lexiac," [...] described by <b>Strick</b> as [...] "a schizo/scary mega-villain." [...] Superman is later resurrected by the power of 'K,' a natural force representing the spirit of Krypton, as he defeats Lexiac.|$|E
500|$|The {{mainstream}} {{scientific community}} dismissed Reich's orgone theory as pseudoscience. James <b>Strick,</b> an historian {{of science at}} Franklin and Marshall College, wrote in 2015 that the dominant narrative since Reich's death has been that [...] "there {{is no point in}} looking more closely at Reich's science because there was no legitimate science from Reich." ...|$|E
500|$|Wesley <b>Strick</b> was {{initially}} hired to pen a script {{for a new}} Nightmare on Elm Street, after he impressed Emmerich with a prequel script he wrote for the 1995 film Seven; the film was never produced. Eric Heisserer was subsequently hired to provide a rewrite of Strick's script before the film moved into production. When Bayer came on board he received a script that reflected the combined efforts of <b>Strick</b> and Heisserer, and which still [...] "needed to be tinkered with". Bayer explained that the script goes deeper into [...] " [...] as a person [...] how he became the thing he was". Bayer expressed that, unlike the Friday the 13th remake that picked the best parts from the first four films, the Nightmare remake is coming straight from the first film. At one point there was a scene in an early draft of the script where some characters were playing Guitar Hero. Fuller explained that the scene was removed to keep the film from feeling dated. To him, if someone watched the film five years later, and Guitar Hero was not as popular as it once was, it would automatically make the film feel more dated upon viewing. At the same time, they wanted the film to feel relevant, and including things like the Internet, mobile phones, and text messaging would give the film a more timeless feel.|$|E

500|$|There was renewed {{interest}} in November 2007, when the Reich archives at the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine at Harvard University were unsealed; Reich had left instructions that his unpublished papers be stored for 50 years after his death. James <b>Strick</b> began studying Reich's laboratory notebooks from the 1935–1939 bion experiments in Norway. In 2015 Harvard University Press published Strick's Wilhelm Reich, Biologist, in which he writes that Reich's work in Oslo [...] "represented {{the cutting edge of}} light microscopy and time-lapse micro-cinematography." [...] He argues that the dominant narrative of Reich as a pseudoscientist is incorrect and that Reich's story is [...] "much more complex and interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Following El Cid, Fields was {{the sound}} editor on several lesser-known films, {{including}} the experimental film The Balcony (1963) with her Savage Eye colleagues <b>Strick</b> and Maddow. Peter Bogdanovich's first, low-budget film Targets (1968) {{was one of her}} last sound-editing projects, and represents her mature work. Bill Warren has described the scene in which the character Bobby starts sniping at freeway drivers from the top of a large oil storage tank: [...] "The sound is mono, and brilliantly mixed -- the entire sequence of Bobby shooting from the tanks was shot without sound. Verna Fields, then a sound editor, added all the sound effects. The result is seamlessly realistic, from the scrape of the guns on the metal of the tanks, to the crack of the rifles, to the little gasps Bobby makes just before firing." ...|$|E
500|$|Burton {{originally}} did {{not want}} to direct a sequel because of his mixed emotions over the previous film. Sam Hamm's first script had the Penguin and Catwoman searching for hidden treasure. Daniel Waters delivered a script that satisfied Burton, which convinced him to direct the film. Wesley <b>Strick</b> did an uncredited rewrite, deleting characterizations of Harvey Dent and Robin and rewriting the climax. Various A-list actresses lobbied hard for the role of Catwoman before Michelle Pfeiffer was cast, while Danny DeVito signed on to portray the Penguin. Filming started at Warner Bros. in Burbank, California in June 1991. Batman Returns was released with financial success, but Warner Bros. was disappointed with the film's box office run because it earned less than its predecessor. However, Batman Returns was released to generally positive reviews, although a [...] "parental backlash" [...] criticized the film for containing violence and sexual innuendos that were thought to be unsuitable for children. McDonald's shut down its Happy Meal tie-in for Batman Returns.|$|E
