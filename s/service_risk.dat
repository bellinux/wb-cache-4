5000|$|The National Appeals Division (NAD) of USDA was {{established}} by the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Title II of P.L. 103-354) to consolidate and improve the hearing procedures for USDA claims and disputes. The statute and regulations provide that certain sections of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (P.L. 79-404, as amended), including the hearing requirements, {{do not apply to}} NAD proceedings. The NAD procedures govern informal and formal hearings covering appeals of decisions made by the rural development agencies, Natural Resources Conservation <b>Service,</b> <b>Risk</b> Management Agency, and the Farm Service Agency. The statute and regulations set forth the procedures for hearings, requirements for the presiding officers, requirements for communications between the decision-maker and persons interested in the matter, and other important issues. After a decision is made by a hearing officer, both the appellant and the agency have the right to a review by the NAD director, who then issues a final determination. The final determination of the NAD is reviewable and enforceable by the U.S. District Court in accordance with the judicial review provisions of the APA.|$|E

5000|$|When {{computers}} {{used for}} normal business services {{are affected by}} a [...] "major incident" [...] that cannot be fixed quickly, then the Information Technology Service Continuity (ITSC) Plan is performed, by the ITSC recovery team. This plan will always assume that the production computing equipment and the wider geographic location they normally reside at might become completely out of bounds at an unpredictable time, without any warning. The location chosen to rebuild the service (the recovery site) must be distant (for example, at least 10 miles) from the normal Production site and suffer no threats {{in common with the}} production site (e.g. they should not be near the same coastline). The ITSC Plan must also satisfy two measurements- the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for any potentially affected services. These measures are determined by a team of people, called the Business Continuity (BC) team, that quantifies what losses might ensue if the services are not available. It is sobering to think that [...] "potential loss of life" [...] appears in far more IT <b>service</b> <b>risk</b> assessments than one might assume. The RTO and RPO are time intervals, typically expressed in number of hours, specified by the BC team to be the longest time the business can allow for without incurring significant risks or significant loss, allowing system designers to specify designs that are as cost effective as the RTO and RPO will permit.|$|E
30|$|We {{would like}} also to clarify {{one more time}} that we {{recommend}} categorizing events and incidents due to denial of service (DoS) attacks as in the <b>service</b> <b>risk</b> domain, because a DoS attack is designed to diminish the QoS or GoS, and therefore it is a <b>service</b> <b>risk</b> {{from the perspective of}} consequences.|$|E
30|$|We also {{examine the}} {{sensitivity}} of risk against the number of alternative services (i.e., available services for the same service type within the inter-cloud.) We observe {{that the number of}} alternative services does not change the security or privacy risks. However, it impacts on the <b>service</b> <b>risk.</b> When there is one alternative service in the average for each type of service in a mashup made up of 11 service types, the <b>service</b> <b>risk</b> is calculated as 0.0191. When the average number of alternatives becomes two, the <b>service</b> <b>risk</b> goes down to 0.0001. When it is three in the average, the risk becomes almost zero.|$|E

In such context, service experience becomes a key issue for determining the <b>service</b> <b>risk</b> drivers for operational disruptions and maintenance burden. This paper presents an industrial case study to produce new knowledge on the relationships between degradation and component design to manufacture. The study applied semantic data mining as a methodology for an efficient and the consistent data capture, representation, and analysis. The paper aims at identifying the <b>service</b> <b>risk</b> drivers based on service experience and event data. The analysis shows that the 3 top mechanisms accounting for 32 % of the mechanism references have a strong Pareto effect.

30|$|Since AS, AP and AG are {{stochastic}} processes, their result are not deterministic (i.e., includes uncertainty through random variables). Therefore, a TaaS {{using our}} model first needs to build confidence intervals for AS, AP and AG (i.e., u(AS)[*]<[*]AS <[*]v(AS), u(AP)[*]<[*]AP <[*]v(AP) and u(AG)[*]<[*]AG <[*]v(AG)) {{according to the}} confidence level λ given by the CC.

30|$|Risk {{and trust}} {{should not be}} treated as related only to {{security}} but also QoS and GoS. The centralization and mutualization of resources reduce the costs. However, shared resources may be congested from time to time. Congestion control, service differentiation, user differentiation and prioritization are complex challenges especially for large clouds with high scalability requirements. The CCs need to be assured that their SLOs on GoS and QoS requirements are fulfilled and their operations are not hampered due to congested cloud resources. Providing such an assurance, measuring and guaranteeing QoS/GoS are not trivial tasks. JRTM treats QoS and GoS related risks within the <b>service</b> <b>risk</b> domain based on the SLOs agreed in SLAs.|$|E
