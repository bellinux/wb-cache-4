50|$|The first {{theory that}} {{predicted}} the correct direction of rectification of the metal-semiconductor junction {{was given by}} Nevill Mott in 1939. He found the solution for both the diffusion and drift currents of the majority carriers through the semiconductor surface space charge layer which has been known since about 1948 as the Mott barrier. Walter H. Schottky and Spenke extended Mott's theory by including a donor ion whose density is spatially constant through the semiconductor surface layer. This changed the constant electric field assumed by Mott to a linearly decaying electric field. This semiconductor <b>space-charge</b> <b>layer</b> under the metal {{is known as the}} Schottky barrier. A similar theory was also proposed by Davydov in 1939. Although it gives the correct direction of rectification, it has also been proven that the Mott theory and its Schottky-Davydov extension gives the wrong current limiting mechanism and wrong current-voltage formulae in silicon metal/semiconductor diode rectifiers. The correct theory was developed by Hans Bethe and reported by him in a M.I.T. Radiation Laboratory Report dated November 23, 1942. In Bethe's theory, the current is limited by thermionic emission of electrons over the metal-semiconductor potential barrier. Thus, the appropriate name for the metal-semiconductor diode should be the Bethe diode, instead of the Schottky diode, since the Schottky theory does not predict the modern metal-semiconductor diode characteristics correctly.|$|E

The formation of nanodomains is not limited to bulk areas as previously reported but exists at grain boundaries as well. With enhanced ordering level, such nanodomains formed at grain boundaries will decrease the ionic conductivity as a result of hindered the mobility of oxygen vacancies in doped ceria.

However, several critical challenges impede {{the development of a}} practical Li-O 2 battery. One of these challenges is the sluggish transport of ions and/or electrons through the Li 2 O 2 discharge product. The purpose of this work is to develop a physics-based picture of transport phenomena within the Li-O 2 discharge product and to elucidate how different characteristics of the discharge product influence its apparent transport properties. To this end we employ density functional theory calculations in conjunction with continuum-scale transport models. Our calculations indicate that charge transport in bulk Li 2 O 2 is mediated by hole polarons and Li-ion vacancies, and that a low concentration of these species results in poor intrinsic ionic and electronic conduction. However, structural disorder, the presence of impurities, and the formation of <b>space-charge</b> <b>layers</b> are predicted to significantly enhance charge transport.

The underlying mechanism proposed is electric field-assisted generation and accommodation of defects in the <b>space-charge</b> <b>layers</b> adjacent to the grain surface.

To bring out the basic physics, we consider the simplest possible model of a symmetric binary electrolyte confined between parallel-plate blocking electrodes, ignoring any transverse instability or fluid flow. We analyze the resulting one-dimensional problem by matched asymptotic expansions {{in the limit of}} thin double layers and extend previous work into the strongly nonlinear regime, which is characterized by two features—significant salt depletion in the electrolyte near the electrodes and, at very large voltage, the breakdown of the quasiequilibrium structure of the double layers. The former leads to the prediction of “ac capacitive desalination” since there is a time-averaged transfer of salt from the bulk to the double layers, via oscillating diffusion layers. The latter is associated with transient diffusion limitation, which drives the formation and collapse of <b>space-charge</b> <b>layers,</b> {{even in the absence of}} any net Faradaic current through the cell.
