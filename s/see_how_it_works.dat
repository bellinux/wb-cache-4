500|$|The lyrics {{were written}} with Hoppus and DeLonge going into {{separate}} rooms—Hoppus writing the choruses and DeLonge writing the verses. The two {{had not spoken}} {{to each other about}} the lyrics ahead of time, {{and it turned out that}} the two had both written about sex. When put together, the song represents the lustful side of sex during the verses, the passionate side in the bridge and the romantic side in the chorus, creating a juxtaposition between both voices. It has been interpreted as a description for failed romance, one that [...] "illustrates a scenario of lust, ambivalence and regret." [...] For Barker, the song's drum track was [...] "super in respect to John Bonham. [...] We were kind of messing around with the verse. It’s like, 'Well, I want to do a four-bar drum intro and just <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> for the song.' And we never second-guessed it. We were like, 'That sounds rad.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|VA-11 HALL-A has {{received}} very positive pre-release reception. Carter Dotson of TouchArcade found VA-11 HALL-A to be [...] "kind of an odd one" [...] and [...] "certainly something unique", writing that [...] "I'm not completely {{sure what to}} make of it, and I'm interested to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> out when completed. After all, a game that's story-driven lives and dies on the quality of said story." [...] He compared it to Her Story as something that could [...] "prove to be [...] very cool." [...] This sentiment was echoed by Kyle LeClair of Hardcore Gamer, writing that [...] "VA-11 Hall-A sure looks great and has quite a unique hook to it, so we'll be sure to try and wet our whistles with it when it comes out on the PC". Graham Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun claimed that although [...] "VA-11 Hall-A, whose punctuation I already resent having to type, is skirting with genres I don't care about: anime-styled visual novels", he found VA-11 HALL-As branching-style plotline to be more engaging that an average [...] "linear and relatively uninteractive" [...] visual novel. Rock, Paper, Shotgun also chose VA-11 HALL-A {{to be one of the}} best games shown at EGX Rezzed 2016.|$|E

I {{remember}} one fellow that had it blazing up from a pipe through a flower-bed, just like a jet of water from a fountain. My, my, my!

You know, when they sink a well," [...] he went on to the company, [...] "they can't always most generally sometimes tell whether they're goin' to get gas or oil or salt water. Why, when they first began to bore for salt water out on the Kanawha, back about the beginning of the century, they used to get gas now and then, and then they considered it a failure; they called a gas-well a blower, and give it up in disgust; the time wasn't ripe for gas yet. Now they bore away sometimes till they get half-way to China, and don't seem to strike anything worth speaking of. Then they put a dynamite torpedo down in the well and explode it. They have a little bar of iron that they call a Go-devil, and they just drop it down on the business end of the torpedo, and then stand from under, if you please! You hear a noise, and in about half a minute you begin to see one, and it begins to rain oil and mud and salt water and rocks and pitchforks and adoptive citizens; and when it clears up the derrick's painted--got a coat on that 'll wear in any climate. That's what our honored host meant. Generally get some visiting lady, when there's one round, to drop the Go-devil. But that day we {{had to put up with}} Conrad here. They offered to let me drop it, but I declined. I told 'em I hadn't much practice with Go-devils in the newspaper syndicate business, and I wasn't very well myself, anyway. Astonishing," [...] Fulkerson continued, with the air of relieving his explanation by an anecdote, [...] "how reckless they get using dynamite when they're torpedoing wells. We stopped at one place where a fellow was handling the cartridges pretty freely, and Mr. Dryfoos happened to caution him a little, and that ass came up with one of 'em in his hand, and began to pound it on the buggy-wheel to show us how safe it was. I turned green, I was so scared; but Mr. Dryfoos kept his color, and kind of coaxed the fellow till he quit. You could see he was the fool kind, that if you tried to stop him he'd keep on hammering that cartridge, just to show that it wouldn't explode, till he blew you into Kingdom Come. When we got him to go away, Mr. Dryfoos drove up to his foreman. 'Pay Sheney off, and discharge him on the spot,' says he. 'He's too safe a man to have round; he knows too much about dynamite.'
