5|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>onion</b> Paranthus rapiformis {{lives on}} subtidal mud flats and burrows into the sediment, holding itself {{in place by}} {{expanding}} its basal disc to form an anchor. If it gets washed out of its burrow by strong currents, it contracts into a pearly glistening ball which rolls about. Tube-dwelling anemones which live in parchment-like tubes, are in the anthozoan subclass Ceriantharia, and are only distantly related to sea anemones.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the <b>sea</b> <b>onion</b> anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{researches}} showing interactions between olfaction and taste. Many of them supported that the interactions are not innate, but are learned through our daily eating experiences. Stevenson (2009) called this phenomenon as “learned synesthesia”. The authors also showed {{the interactions between}} flavor and taste are learned and processed by higher cognitive systems in rats and humans (Sakai et al., 2001; Sakai and Imada, 2003). Here the interactions between umami taste and dashi flavors are developed by the daily eating experience of Japanese traditional cuisine. Twenty flavors (such as <b>sea</b> weed, bonito, <b>onion,</b> garlic, ginger etc. by courtesy of YAMAHO CO. Ltd.) were used as flavor stimuli. Taste stimuli are monosodium glutamate (umami substance, MSG), miso soup, and Katsuo Dashi (bonito soup stock). Participants tasted these stimuli, 12 ∼ 20 stimuli in a day, and evaluated the strength of umami taste, the palatability, congruity between taste and flavor with 100 mm visual analogue scales. The results of evaluations analyzed with the participants' daily eating experience showed the interactions between taste and flavor are developed by their own daily intake of traditional Japanese cuisine, especially dashi soup...|$|R
50|$|Drimia maritima (syn. Urginea maritima) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Scilloideae (formerly the family Hyacinthaceae). This species is known by several common names, including squill, sea squill, <b>sea</b> <b>onion,</b> and maritime squill. It may also be called red squill, particularly a form which produces red-tinged flowers instead of white. It is native to southern Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.|$|E

40|$|Healing {{with plants}} of {{medicinal}} significance {{is as old}} as mankind itself. The awareness of usage of medicinal plants by human beings for the treatment of diverse ailments, is a result of thousands of years of struggles, since, by trial and error, man distinguished between the beneficial and poisonous plants. Ample evidence from various sources - be it written documents, preserved monuments, and even original plant medicines supporting the connection between man and his search for drugs innature dates from the far past. Be it the Indian Holy Books like the Vedas dating around 5000 B. C., or the Chinese book “Pen T’Sao,” written by Emperor Shen Nung in 2500 B. C. describing 365 drugs derived from various dried parts of medicinal plants - various such historical sources relevant for the study of medicinal plants’ use are present. The oldest written evidence of the use of medicinal plants for preparation of drugs has been found on a Sumerian clay slab from Nagpur, approximately 5000 years old (Kelly, 2009). The Ebers Papyrus written in 1550 B. C. refers to 700 plant species and drugs used for therapy such as pomegranate, castorbean, aloe, senna, garlic, onion, fig, willow, coriander, juniper, common centaury, etc. Homer's epics - The Iliad and The Odysseys created in 800 B. C. refer to 63 plant species from the Minoan, Mycenaean, and Egyptian Assyrian pharmacotherapy. Herodotus (500 B. C.) referred to castor oil plant, Orpheus to the fragrant hellebore and garlic, and Pythagoras to the <b>sea</b> <b>onion</b> (Scilla maritima), mustard, and cabbage. The works of Hippocrates (459 B. C. - 370 B. C.) contain about 300 medicinal plants classified by physiological action. Theophrast (371 B. C. - 287 B. C.) gained the epithet of “the father of botany” for his great merits for the classification and description of medicinal plants. He generated a classification of more than 500 medicinal plants known at the time in his books “De Causis Plantarium”— Plant Etiology and “De Historia Plantarium”—Plant History. Celsus (25 B. C. - 50 A. D.), the renowned medical writer quoted approximately 250 medicinal plants such as aloe, henbane, flax, poppy, pepper, cinnamon, the star gentian, cardamom, false hellebore, etc. in his work “De re medica”. In ancient history, the most prominent writer on plant drugs was Dioscorides, “the father of pharmacognosy” who wrote the work “De Materia Medica”. This classical work of ancient history offers plenty of data on the medicinal plants constituting the basic materia medica until the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Pliny the Elder (23 A. D. - 79 A. D.), a contemporary of Dioscorides, who travelled throughout Germanyand Spain, wrote about approximately 1000 medicinal plants in his book “Historia naturalis. ”...|$|E
