C. and Archaeology, Dr. Harisingh Gour University, Sagar on the monolithic pillar of Budhgupta. These small inscriptions reveal {{the name of}} a Samant Jesh and Kulajgupta. It has also been known from these inscriptions that samant Jesh had written the account of a war.

5000|$|The famous Chinese {{traveler}} Xuanzang {{mentioned in}} his travelogues about Lo-to-mo-chi (Raktamrittika) Mahavihara, an important centre of learning of Vajrayana Buddhists near Karnasuvarna. It {{has been identified}} with Rajbaridanga. The archaeological site of Rajbaridanga is about 2.4 km from Karnasubarna railway station in {{the bank of the}} Bhagirathi River. Local transport like cycle vans, e-rickshaws (Toto) are available. This site was first excavated by a team from the Department of Archaeology, University of Calcutta in 1962 under the direction of S.R. Das. [...] Amongst the findings, the most significant one was a monastic <b>sealing</b> <b>bearing</b> the legend Shri Rakta(m)rttika (Ma)havaiharik arya bhikshu (samgha)s(y)a (of the community of venerable monks residing in the Shri Raktamrittika Mahavihara). The other significant findings are terracotta figurines and ornamental stucco mouldings including human heads. Two other sites close by have been excavated at Rakshashidanga (in 1929-30 by K.N. Dixit of the Archaeological Survey of India) and Nil Kuthi. The whole area was ...|$|E
40|$|Industry {{sources have}} {{reported}} that over 90 percent of all rolling element bearings will not reach their projected design life. Millions will fail prematurely each year from such causes as dirt and moisture contamination. The overwhelming majority of these failures could be prevented {{through the use of}} appropriately engineered, properly selected, and suitably installed bearing housing seals. Associated savings in labor, materials, and energy would accrue due to extended oil change intervals and a portion of the energy savings component in this equation would consist of lubricant manufacturing cost avoidance. A second, significant portion would be {{associated with the use of}} synthetic lubricants. It has been ascertained that utilization of synthetic lubes would become far more practical if oil drain intervals could be extended. This paper reviews the shortcomings of traditional bearing housing sealing methods and explains available, cost-effective aerospace-derived state-of-art solutions which have proven to meet the objectives of hermetically <b>sealing</b> <b>bearing</b> housings on the widest possible spectrum of rotating machinery in virtually every industry...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} research is {{a contribution to}} the Geological-Geotechnical knowledge about the area where the PARCON project will be built. The first work was the investigation of existing information, both at the sector level, and the geology on a large scale. The field work involved the drainage basin areas, including Dam and Spillway site also lending areas and quarries. Geomorphological characteristics were analyzed, and lithological geoestructurales, taking into consideration the main objectives of the project is to build the biggest Dam reservoir on the Polytechnic Campus Gustavo Galindo. We conducted a detailed geological survey of the area of the Dam site and its abutments; information also was obtained for the reservoir and the strip of land site of the Spillway. The next step was field geophysical exploration and interpretation. It made plenty of observations and sampling at different points in taking advantage of the large number of excavations, with the stony ground of exploitation had been made across the sector. This thesis also includes a hydro-geological and geotechnical analysis aimed at determining the <b>sealing,</b> <b>bearing</b> and shear strength, plus the quality of materials for construction. The work provided information directly related to the design and construction process of the proposed Da...|$|E

50|$|Since the 1920s, the ever-growing {{dissemination}} of <b>sealed</b> <b>bearings</b> throughout the manufacturing industries {{has made the}} use of grease fittings less common. <b>Sealed</b> <b>bearings</b> are lubricated for life at the factory, and are sealed such that the lubricant is not lost or dirtied. Grease fittings are far from obsolete, however, and much new machinery is built with them every year (e.g., tractors, lawnmowers, industrial plant equipment, and still a few car and truck parts). As long as maintenance is even minimally attended to (via occasional lube jobs where new grease is pumped into the bearing), this type of bearing and lubrication setup is cost-effective, simple, and long-lasting.|$|R

5|$|The reigns of Djedkare Isesi and of Unas were a time {{of changes}} in Ancient Egyptian {{religion}} and in the ideology of kingship, changes that are first demonstrable under Unas.
