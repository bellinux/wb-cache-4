2500|$|On June 4, 2011, Wallenda {{completed}} a [...] high-wire crossing {{between the two}} towers of the ten-story Condado Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The [...] performance was a recreation of the act that had killed Karl Wallenda in 1978. For the performance, Wallenda's mother, Delilah (Karl's granddaughter), joined him. The mother and son team started {{at opposite ends of}} the wire. [...] When Delilah reached the middle of the wire, roughly the spot Karl had fallen, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the wire and Nik stepped over her before the two continued to opposite ends of the wire. At one point during the performance, Nik knelt down on the wire and blew a kiss in honor of his great-grandfather's memory.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{a slab of}} lichened granite, and Dick found a place beside her.|$|E
60|$|Selena gave {{a little}} gasp. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the lowest step and untied her bonnet strings.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> panting, <b>on</b> the tussocky grass. Her {{cheeks were}} flushed pink. He kissed her, {{and she gave}} way to joy.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> {{suddenly}} <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a rough wooden {{seat and}} commenced to cry. For {{the first time}} Wingrave {{looked at her with}} some apparent interest.|$|R
60|$|Anne had got to {{that point}} where an excited woman must go mad or cry. Anne cried. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> flatly <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a chair and burst into tears.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a log at {{the corner}} of the house, and pulled me down beside her.|$|E
60|$|So saying, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a low stool {{with her}} paper on her knees, and her pencil in her hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the edge}} of the sofa, and though the gong was about to sound, incited him to dawdle and stay with her.|$|E
60|$|Her {{face grew}} softer and more thoughtful. Suddenly she laughed {{outright}} to herself. <b>She</b> went and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the couch, where Wolfenden had been lying.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the floor}} for several minutes. She had probably, Tallente decided as he watched her, some way of {{suffering}} in secret, all the more terrible because of its repression. When she looked up, her face seemed pinched and older. Her voice, however, was steady.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> now <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a sofa, {{and pointed}} to a chair for him, but he {{remained}} standing, and did so during the whole interview; or rather, walking; for when he became energetic and impetuous, he moved about from place to place in the room, as though incapable of fixing himself in one position.|$|R
60|$|Madame Fontaine behaved admirably. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the window-seat {{at the end}} of the landing, and wrung {{her hands}} with a gesture of despair.|$|E
60|$|She {{drew him}} another glass. Then <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the bench {{at the table}} with him and the soldiers, and fixed him with her attention.|$|E
60|$|The {{light went}} out of Una's eyes. Her lips trembled. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> her stool again, a pathetic little figure of disappointment, and began to cry.|$|E
60|$|He {{expected}} her to move away, and wondered whether it was tactful for him to stop, but to his surprise <b>she</b> smiled and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the bridge.|$|R
60|$|Cousin Maria did {{not answer}} a word. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> right <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the door-step and took off her spectacles. She rubbed them with her apron, and then put them on again. But there was no mistake. There were the men. If she had seen four ghosts {{she could not have}} been more astonished.|$|R
6000|$|Instead {{of leaving}} me then, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> quietly <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the bench. [...] "Se√±or," [...] she said, [...] "if {{it is your}} {{intention}} to continue your journey to-morrow, let me advise you not to do so. You can safely remain here for a few days, for in this sad house we have no visitors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I surely will," [...] replied Columbine, gladly, and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the edge}} of the bed. [...] "Ben, you fetch that box and put his dinner on it." ...|$|E
60|$|After dinner {{she set the}} {{electric}} piano-player going. And he augured the worst when <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a cushion footstool at his knee, {{and put her hand}} on his.|$|E
60|$|They did flash; but Kate laughed {{immediately}} after, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a {{chair in}} front of me and cradled her long, thin, spirited dark face in her palms.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{think you}} {{understand}} {{better than most}} people," [...] <b>she</b> answered, and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a little chair placed beside a big leather chair so that Hewet {{had to sit down}} beside her.|$|R
60|$|Speech failed her, and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{suddenly}} <b>on</b> a {{chair at}} the table, glaring unutterable malevolence and misery. She arose with the abrupt stiffness of an automaton, poured herself a cup of cold coffee, and in the same jerky way <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again. As if too hot for her lips, she filled her saucer with the greasy-looking, nondescript fluid, and continued her set glare, her breast rising and falling with staccato, mechanical movement.|$|R
60|$|Then {{very nearly}} he kissed her, only {{he was in}} such a hurry, also the willow log, a large one, was between them; {{possibly}} she had arranged that this should be so. So he could only press her hand and depart, muttering something indistinguishable. She watched him vanish, after which <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>on</b> the log and really did laugh. Still, it was a queer kind of merriment, for by degrees it turned into little sobs and tears.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a {{piece of}} broken timber and put one arm across her face. He waited--then {{approaching}} his lips to her ear: [...] "Let us go," [...] he whispered.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the window-seat, {{with her}} elbows {{on her knees}} and her hands {{grasping}} her forehead. A long moaning cry burst from her. She said to herself bitterly the one word--"Farewell!" ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the grass}} {{and tried to think}} which way she had come, and which way she ought to return in order to get across the gulch to the farm-house.|$|E
6000|$|With a {{malicious}} smile, Gyp {{watched her}} retirement among the little tables and elaborately modern chairs till her tall figure had disappeared behind a column. Then <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>on</b> the lounge, pressing {{her hands to}} her burning ears. She had never till then known the strength of the pride-demon within her; at the moment, it was almost stronger than her love. She was still sitting there, when the page-boy brought her another card--her father's. She sprang up saying: ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Selina, {{when she}} saw that <b>she</b> was gone, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the sofa and took her book. She tried to make herself {{believe that she was}} going to read; but it was no use: the tears dimmed her eyes, and she put the book down.|$|R
6000|$|... "How hot {{the night}} is!" [...] she said: and sighed, and resumed {{the subject with}} a steady countenance. [...] "I am not {{surprised}} that your father never mentioned me--to you." [...] She spoke quietly, but her face was paler than ever. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>on</b> the bed. [...] "Is there anything I can do for you," [...] she asked, [...] "before I go away? Oh, I only mean some trifling service that would lay you under no obligation, and would not oblige you to keep up your acquaintance with me." ...|$|R
60|$|The lady ignored this advice, and {{by dint of}} much {{strength}} of mind regained her self-control. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the locker again, and folding her arms showed clearly her intention to remain.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{me there}} do seem {{something}} dreadful {{as well as}} grand in it," [...] said Nita, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a boulder beside Emma, near {{the lower end of}} the chaotic valley.|$|E
60|$|The slandered hens {{were nowhere}} near the pansy bed and Marilla did not even glance at it. Instead, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the cellar hatch and laughed until she was ashamed of herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "A very solemn sermon," [...] said Miss B., {{shaking her}} head impressively, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to table <b>on</b> Sunday noon; then giving a deep sigh, she added, [...] "I am afraid that if an account is to be {{rendered}} for all our idle words, some people will {{have a great deal}} to answer for." ...|$|R
6000|$|Biddy {{gave up her}} work, {{moving away}} from it to look at it. <b>She</b> came and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the long bench on which Sherringham had placed himself. Then she broke out: [...] "Oh Peter, it's a great trouble--it's a very great trouble; and I can't tell you, for I don't {{understand}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{suddenly}} <b>on</b> a stool near by, {{and shook}} with a silent tempest of sobs, unable to speak. He finished his meal, and remained idly thrown {{back in his}} chair, his eyes lost amongst the black rafters of the ceiling. Before him the tallow candle flared red and straight, sending up a slender thread of smoke. The light lay on the rough, sunburnt skin of his throat; the sunk cheeks were like patches of darkness, and his aspect was mournfully stolid, {{as if he had}} ruminated with difficulty endless ideas. Then he said, deliberately-- ...|$|R
