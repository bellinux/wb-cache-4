5|$|Rather {{than using}} a turn-based battle system like {{contemporaneous}} role-playing games, <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> Mana features real-time battles {{with a power}} bar mechanic. The game has a unique Ring Command menu system, which pauses the action and allows the player to make decisions {{in the middle of}} battle. An innovative cooperative multiplayer system allows a second or third player to drop {{in and out of the}} game at any time. <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> Mana was directed and designed by Koichi Ishii, programmed primarily by Nasir Gebelli, and produced by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka.|$|E

5|$|The {{real-time}} battle {{system used}} in <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> Mana {{has been described}} by its creators {{as an extension of the}} battle system used in the first three flagship Final Fantasy titles. The system for experience points and leveling up was taken from Final Fantasy III.

5|$|The {{story of}} <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> Evermore follows {{a boy and}} his pet dog as they are {{inadvertently}} transported to a fantasy world created by an eccentric inventor.

The gameplay shares many similarities with <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> Mana, such as real-time battles, a ring-shaped menu system, and the ability to switch control between the two characters. Despite similar game mechanics and a similar title, it is not an entry in the Mana series.|$|E
5|$|There was an {{apparent}} misconception among video game fans that the SNES title <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> Evermore {{was released in}} lieu of an English language version of Seiken Densetsu 3 in 1995. <b>Secret</b> <b>of</b> Evermore was developed by a new team at Square's office in Redmond, Washington called Square Soft. According to Fehdrau, no one {{who worked on the}} Evermore project would have been involved in a translation of Seiken Densetsu 3; the Redmond team was specifically hired to create Evermore. In 2000, a fan translation project for Seiken Densetsu 3 led by Neill Corlett was successfully completed and made available on the internet as an unofficial patch, which could be applied to ROMs of the game when played with an emulator or played on a Super NES console with a development kit or backup device.
