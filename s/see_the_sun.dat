5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men began to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> rise again over the Yukon—it {{was a very}} short day for them, and none {{had been able to}} sleep for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the stimulant benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The reader {{progressively}} learns their history. Dobroselova originally {{lived in}} the country, but moved to St. Petersburg (which she hates) when her father lost his job. Her father becomes very violent and her mother severely depressed. Her father dies and they move in with Anna Fyodorovna, a landlady who was previously cruel to them but at least pretends to feel sympathy for their situation. Dobroselova is tutored by a poor student named Pokrovsky, whose drunken father occasionally visits. She eventually {{falls in love with}} Pokrovsky. She struggles to save a measly amount of money to purchase the complete works of Pushkin at the market for his birthday present, then allows his father to give the books to him instead, claiming that just knowing he received the books will be enough for her happiness. Pokrovsky falls ill soon after, and his dying wish is to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> and the world outside. Dobroselova obliges by opening the blinds to reveal grey clouds and dirty rain. In response Pokrovsky only shakes his head and then passes away. Dobroselova's mother dies shortly afterwards, and Dobroselova is left in the care of Anna for a time, but the abuse becomes too much and she goes to live with Fedora across the street.|$|E

25|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the eclipse, many {{counterfeit}} glasses were put up for sale. Effective eclipse glasses must not only block most visible light, but most UV and infrared light as well. For visible light, the user should only be able to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> sunglint reflected off shiny metal, halogen bulbs, the filament in unfrosted incandescent bulbs, and similarly intense sources. Determining whether the glasses effectively block enough UV and infrared light requires the use of spectrophotometer, which is a rather expensive piece of lab equipment.|$|E
25|$|Many {{churches in}} the American South still hold {{traditional}} sunrise services in cemeteries {{as a sign of}} recognition that Jesus no longer lay in the tomb on Easter morning. The service starts {{early in the morning and}} is timed so that the attendants can <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> rise when the service is going. Services usually loosely follow the format of the church's normal service and can include music (hymns or praise band), dramatic scenes and the Easter message. After the service, the church may serve a breakfast for the attendees.|$|E

25|$|The {{shape of}} the Earth was not only {{discussed}} in scholarly works written in Latin; it was also treated in works written in vernacular languages or dialects and intended for wider audiences. The Norwegian book Konungs Skuggsjá, from around 1250, states clearly that the Earth is spherical—and that there is night {{on the opposite side}} of the Earth when there is daytime in Norway. The author also discusses the existence of antipodes—and he notes that (if they exist) they <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> in the north of the middle of the day, and that they experience seasons opposite those of people in the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Size is not {{the only}} factor in making red dwarfs {{potentially}} unsuitable for life, however. On a red dwarf planet, photosynthesis on the night side would be impossible, since it would never <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun.</b> On the day side, because the sun does not rise or set, areas in the shadows of mountains would remain so forever. Photosynthesis as we understand it would be {{complicated by the fact that}} a red dwarf produces most of its radiation in the infrared, and on the Earth the process depends on visible light. There are potential positives to this scenario. Numerous terrestrial ecosystems rely on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis, for instance, which would be possible in a red dwarf system. A static primary star position removes the need for plants to steer leaves toward the sun, deal with changing shade/sun patterns, or change from photosynthesis to stored energy during night. Because of the lack of a day-night cycle, including the weak light of morning and evening, far more energy would be available at a given radiation level.|$|E

500|$|After {{a series}} of delays, Black Lab asked to be {{released}} from Epic; legal problems with the record label ensued, but the band won the rights to the master recordings of the material they had been working on. While searching for a new label, the band self-released a six-song EP in 2003, first online and then on CD, which featured [...] "Learn to Crawl" [...] and the single [...] "See the Sun". However, the planned second full-length, called <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> wouldn't see light until 2005, after the band decided on an independent release. <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> did not receive any mainstream press coverage, but online reviews noted the band's turn toward increasing use of keyboards and synthesizers to introduce and underlay tracks, describing it as [...] "startling, but in a good way". The band benefited heavily from promotion from online rock site Alternative Addiction, who included the track [...] "Lonely Boy" [...] on one of its compilations, regularly reports on the band's music, and places them in heavy rotation on its internet radio station.|$|E
500|$|After the 1971 Lin Biao incident, the {{military}} attempted to improve Peng's living conditions, but {{the years of}} deprivation and torture from 1967–1970 had seriously weakened his physical health, and from late 1972 until his death Peng was seriously ill, probably with tuberculosis, thrombosis, or both. Peng was briefly hospitalized in 1973 before being returned to prison, {{the first time that}} he had been outside of prison since 1967. Peng's niece, Peng Meikui, visited Peng in the hospital and convinced his jailers to allow an operation, but the nature and results of this operation are unknown. Peng's medical condition deteriorated further in 1974; but, because of direct orders from Mao not to treat him, he received no substantial medical aid. Peng died at 3:35 PM on November 29, 1974. His last wish was to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> and trees outside the windows of his hospital room (the windows were covered with newspaper), but this request was denied.

500|$|The Toronto Star {{described}} the Codeine's music as slowcore, a style AllMusic stated {{was famous for}} having a slow pace and skeletal music with [...] "melodies linger forever and rhythms lurch forward, all shrouded in thick, dank atmospherics." [...] Stewart Mason of AllMusic {{described the}} music of Barely Real as {{a continuation of the}} style made on their previous album", while comparing a review of the compilation album When I <b>See</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> in Exclaim! proposed that the group's music [...] "didn't change much during their five years together ― all the songs are relentlessly slow and possess an emotional detachment verging on apathy." [...] When asked about the music's pace, on Barely Real, Immerwahr said the music was in contrast to grunge music of the era, and that slowing it down made it [...] "challenging for people and challenging for audiences. And I actually kind of like that." [...] In a contemporary review, Ned Raggett of AllMusic stated this style is exemplified on songs like [...] "Realize", which continued the hybrid of a deliberate pace with electric guitar playing with softly sung vocals. Some tracks contained a variation on Codeine's music, such as [...] "Promise of Love", which Raggett characterized as having a [...] "late-night jazz club style" [...] that only contains more traditional Codeine styled music towards the end. Other songs that veried the sound included the piano-based track [...] "W." [...] performed by David Grubbs and quick stuttering guitar riff on [...] "Jr". Immerwhar spoke about the tracks [...] "W." [...] and [...] "Promise of Love", [...] opining that [...] "W." [...] created a [...] "nice transition from the severity of 'Hard to Find' to the jazzy 'Promise of Love'" ...|$|E
