40|$|Copyright © 2004 Oxford University Press Gain-of-function {{missense}} {{mutations in}} FGF receptor 2 (FGFR 2) {{are responsible for}} a variety of craniosynostosis syndromes including Apert syndrome (AS), Pfeiffer syndrome (PS) and Crouzon syndrome (CS). Unlike the majority of FGFR 2 mutations, S 252 W and P 253 R AS mutations and a D 321 A PS mutation retain ligand-dependency and are also associated with severe limb pathology. In addition, a recently identified ligand-dependent S 252 L/A 315 <b>S</b> <b>double</b> mutation in FGFR 2 was shown to cause syndactyly in the absence of craniosynostosis. Here, we analyze the effect of the canonical AS mutations, the D 321 A PS mutation and the S 252 L/A 315 <b>S</b> <b>double</b> mutation on FGFR 2 ligand binding affinity and specificity using surface plasmon resonance. Both AS mutations and the D 321 A PS mutation, but not the S 252 L/A 315 <b>S</b> <b>double</b> mutation, increase the binding affinity of FGFR 2 c to multiple FGFs expressed in the cranial suture. Additionally, all four pathogenic mutations also violate FGFR 2 c ligand binding specificity and enable this receptor to bind FGF 10. Based on our data, we propose that an increase in mutant FGFR 2 c binding t...|$|R

40|$|Sensitivity {{experiments}} with an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) show that parameterized rain re-evaporation {{has a large}} impact on simulated precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific, especially on {{the configuration of the}} model s intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Weak re-evaporation leads t o the formation of a "double ITCZ" during the northern warm season. The double ITCZ is accompanied by strong coupling between precipitation and high-frequency vertical motion in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Strong reevaporation leads to a better overall agreement of simulated precipitation with observations. The model <b>s</b> <b>double</b> ITCZ bias is reduced. At the same time, correlation between high-frequency vertical motion in the PBL and precipitation is reduced. Experiments with modified physics suggest that evaporative cooling by rain near the PBL top weakens the coupling between precipitation and vertical motion. This may reduce the model s tendency to form double ITCZs. The strength of high-frequency vertical motions in the PBL was also reduced directly through the introduction of a diffusive cumulus momentum transport (DCMT) parameterization. The DCMT had a visible impact on simulated precipitation in the tropics, but did not reduce the model <b>s</b> <b>double</b> bias in all cases...|$|R
