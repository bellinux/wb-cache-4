25|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, Horowitz {{developed}} a close friendship with Huey P. Newton, {{founder of the}} Black Panther Party. Horowitz later portrayed Newton as equal parts gangster, terrorist, intellectual, and media celebrity. As part of their work together, Horowitz helped raise money for, and assisted the Panthers with, the running of a school for poor children in Oakland. He recommended that Newton hire Betty Van Patter as bookkeeper; she was then working for Ramparts. In December 1974, Van Patter's body was found floating in San Francisco Harbor; she had been murdered. Horowitz has <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> Panthers were behind the killing.|$|E

"Ghost of a Chance" [...] {{continues}} {{a common}} motif repeated throughout {{the first season}} of Crosetti discussing various conspiracy theories about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States. Crosetti <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> killing was arranged by the highest ranks of the Confederate States of America. Crosetti's fascination with the Lincoln assassination was based on Tom Fontana's real-life obsession with it. Throughout the episode, Lewis mournfully discussed the then-recent closing of Baltimore's Memorial Stadium.

"Son of a Gun" [...] {{continues}} {{a common}} motif repeated throughout {{the first season}} of Crosetti discussing various conspiracy theories about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States. Crosetti <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> killing was arranged by the highest ranks of the Confederate States of America. Crosetti's fascination with the Lincoln assassination was based on Tom Fontana's real-life obsession with it.

500|$|Scott has <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> {{underlying}} {{emotion of}} Hannibal is [...] "affection". [...] "In some instances, {{you might even}} wonder or certainly from one direction—is it more than affection? It is dark, because the story is of course essentially dark, but it's kind of romantic at the same time." [...] Scott openly admits to a [...] "romantic thematic" [...] running though the film. He told CNN that: [...] "Hannibal was quite a different target, essentially a study between two individuals. Funny enough, it's rather romantic and also quite humorous, but also there's some quite bad behaviour as well." [...] During the opera scene in Florence, Lecter attends an operatic adaptation of one of Dante's sonnets, and meets with Detective Pazzi and his wife, Allegra. She asks Lecter, [...] "Do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter?" [...] Lecter replies: [...] "Yes, I believe he could... but would she see through the bars of his plight and ache for him?" [...] This scene, in the film, is one which Scott claims most people [...] "missed" [...] the meaning of. It was in reference to Starling—to their encounter in The Silence of the Lambs. The New York Times, in its review of the film, said Hannibal, [...] "toys" [...] {{with the idea of}} [...] "love that dare not speak its name". Composer Hans Zimmer believes there to be [...] "many" [...] messages and subtext in each scene of the film. He said, [...] "I can score this movie truly as a Freudian archetypal beauty and the beast fairy tale, as a horror movie, as the most elegant piece, on corruption in the American police force, as the loneliest woman on earth, the beauty in renaissance..." [...] Zimmer ultimately believes it to be a dark love story, centering on two people who should never be together—a modern day Romeo and Juliet. During the film's post-production, Scott, Zimmer and the editor passionately argued about what a single shot meant, where a tear slides down Starling's cheek during a confrontation with Lecter. They could not agree if it was a tear of [...] "anguish", [...] "loneliness" [...] or [...] "disgust". Scott told the New York Post that, the affair of the heart between Lecter and Starling is [...] "metaphorical". Rolling Stone magazine even said in their review, [...] "Scott offers a sly parody of relationships—think 'When Hannibal met Sally'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like The Office, Parks and Recreation is filmed with a single-camera setup in a cinéma vérité style {{simulating}} {{the look}} of an actual documentary, with no studio audience or laugh track. Within {{the context of the}} show, the characters are being filmed by a documentary crew, the members of which are never seen or heard from on-screen. The actors occasionally look at and directly address the cameras, and in some scenes directly engage the cameras in one-on-one interviews with the documentary crew members. The episodes are scripted, but the production encourages the cast to improvise, and dialogue or performances the actors make up during filming often make the final cut of the episodes. Schur <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> mockumentary style is particularly fitting for a show about city government because, [...] "It's a device for showing the ways people act and behave differently when they're in public and private [...] the difference between what goes on behind closed doors and what people present to the public is a huge issue." ...|$|E
