25|$|By {{the summer}} of 1950 Randall had {{arranged}} for a three-year research fellowship that would fund Rosalind Franklin in his laboratory. Franklin was delayed in finishing her work in Paris. Late in 1950, Randall wrote to Franklin to inform her that rather than work on protein, she should take advantage of Wilkins's preliminary work and that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> X-ray studies of DNA fibers made from Signer's samples of DNA.|$|E
25|$|Maidens sing a delicate, sentimental song ("On {{the blue}} Vistula") to {{entertain}} Marina as her chambermaid dresses her hair. Marina declares her preference for heroic songs of chivalry. She dismisses everyone. Alone, she sings of her boredom ("How tediously and sluggishly"), of Dmitriy, {{and of her}} thirst for adventure, power, and glory. The Jesuit Rangoni enters, bemoans the wretched state of the church, attempts to obtain Marina's promise that when she becomes Tsaritsa she will convert the heretics of Moscow (Russian Orthodox Church) to the true faith (Roman Catholicism), and encourages her to bewitch the Pretender. When Marina wonders why <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> this, Rangoni angrily insists that she stop short of nothing, including sacrificing her honor, to obey the dictates of the church. Marina expresses contempt of his hypocritical insinuations and demands he leave. As Rangoni ominously tells her {{she is in the}} thrall of infernal forces, Marina collapses in dread. Rangoni demands her obedience.|$|E
500|$|For instance, Plutarch recounts, in his Sayings of Spartan Women, {{upon his}} departure, Leonidas' wife Gorgo asked what <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> {{if he did}} not return, to which Leonidas replied, [...] "Marry a good man and have good children." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nita is in now, senor. She has {{not told}} {{me why you}} wanted to see her. She said it was better that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not <b>do</b> so, but she thought she knew who it was." ...|$|R
60|$|M. le Duc sighed when {{he thought}} it all out. Though Lydie had done exactly what he himself wanted her to do, he hated the idea that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have <b>done</b> it because Gaston de Stainville had persuaded her.|$|R
500|$|... {{has become}} a {{bridgehead}} between East and West. It is now vital that Australia should understand {{the problems of the}} East, that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> whatever is in her power to alleviate those problems, and that she should interpret the nature of those problems {{to the rest of the}} world.|$|E
500|$|In November 2001, {{she became}} the first person other than a {{president}} to deliver the weekly presidential radio address. She used the opportunity to discuss the plight of women in Afghanistan leading up to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, saying, [...] "The brutal oppression of women is a central goal of the terrorists." [...] Her husband was originally to give the address but he felt that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> it; she later recalled, [...] "At that moment, it was not that I found my voice. Instead, it was as if my voice found me." [...] Her words summarized one of the goals and moral rationales of the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and it became one of the more famous speeches of his administration. In May 2002, she made a speech to the people of Afghanistan through Radio Liberty. [...] In March 2005, she made the first of three trips to that country as First Lady.|$|E
500|$|Lisa {{tries to}} {{convince}} Homer and Marge that college suits her, but {{they refuse to}} listen, saying that college {{is no place for}} her. Lisa is also ridiculed by Groundskeeper Willie and all of her friends at school, saying that she is too [...] "college for them". In the meantime, Bart gets used to his bubble, as it brings him a lot of popularity. Bart tells Lisa what <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> to get her friends back: she has to pull a prank on Principal Skinner. The next day, Chalmers is dedicating the Seymour Skinner parking annex. While Martin takes pictures of Skinner posing next to a giant chocolate cake in his dress polyester, Bart rolls Lisa (inside his bubble) {{to the edge of the}} school's roof. He then pushes her over the edge, splattering the cake all over Skinner. Lisa gets her friends back, while Bart goes paranoid after being outside of his bubble for the first time in days. He stays in an air vent, but gets sucked in.|$|E
60|$|Gudrun did {{not know}} what to say. What <b>should</b> <b>she</b> say? What <b>should</b> <b>she</b> feel? What <b>should</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> What did they expect of her? She was coldly at a loss.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{if it did}} {{not hurt}} her then, why should it hurt her again? There's old General M'Kinnon, my father's old friend, who runs about {{everywhere}} in a wheeled-chair with a leg-rest; and I can't think why <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not <b>do</b> the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Maurice Cumming did not rightly {{calculate}} all this; nor indeed did Miss Jack do so {{as thoroughly}} as <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have <b>done,</b> for Miss Jack knew more about such matters than did poor Maurice. [...] "If you like Marion, why don't you marry her?" ...|$|R
500|$|The {{redesign}} of the obverse {{has led to}} an enduring myth that the breast was covered up out of prudishness, or in response to public outcry. [...] Breen stated that [...] "through their Society for the Suppression of Vice, the guardians of prudery at once began exerting political pressure on the Treasury Department to revoke authorization for these 'immoral' coins". [...] Ron Guth and Jeff Garrett, in their book on US coins by type, aver that the covering up of Liberty was [...] "a change never authorized by MacNeil". [...] Numismatic historian David Lange concedes that {{there is no evidence of}} outcry from the public, but suggests that the decision to change the coin was [...] "more likely prompted by objections from the Treasury Department". Numismatist Ray Young, in his 1979 article in Coins magazine about the quarter, suggested that the redesign [...] "came from the symbolism. [...] If Liberty was going to stand up to her foes, <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> so protected—not 'naked to her enemies.' Thus the war probably had much more to do with the change than any alleged 'public indignation.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{credits include}} Clare Torry, a session singer and songwriter, {{and a regular}} at Abbey Road. [...] She had worked on pop {{material}} and numerous cover albums, and after hearing one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on Wright's composition [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky". [...] She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch Chuck Berry perform at the Hammersmith Odeon, but arranged to come in on the following Sunday. [...] The band explained the concept behind the album, but were unable to tell her exactly what <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do.</b> [...] Gilmour {{was in charge of}} the session, and in a few short takes on a Sunday night Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth, and wanted to apologise to the band – only to find them delighted with her performance. [...] Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track. [...] For her contribution she was paid £30, equivalent to about £ in , but in 2004 she sued EMI and Pink Floyd for songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky" [...] was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship. [...] The High Court agreed with her, but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. [...] All post-2005 pressings therefore credit Wright and Torry jointly for the song.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2015, Huang wrote a {{controversial}} advice {{article for the}} Science Careers website. A female postdoctoral scholar asked what <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> in response to her advisor looking down her shirt. Huang replied, [...] "I suggest you put up with it, with good humor if you can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{would have}} spoken to you at once--and {{it was due to}} you that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have <b>done</b> so--but <b>she</b> was timid; and not unnaturally so. And then it was right that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> see her father and me before she quite made up her own mind. But I may say that it is settled now." ...|$|R
60|$|Poor Mary Bold sat down, {{and sadly}} {{finished}} her note, {{saying that she}} would herself attend the party, but that her brother was unavoidably prevented from doing so. I fear {{that she did not}} admire as <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have <b>done</b> the self-devotion of his singular virtue.|$|R
60|$|But Edie {{would bear}} no refusal. It was HER money, she said, the first {{she had ever}} earned in her whole life, and <b>she</b> <b>should</b> {{certainly}} <b>do</b> as <b>she</b> herself liked with it. Sir Antony Wraxall, she was quite confident, would {{soon be able to}} make him better.|$|R
6000|$|At {{that touch}} {{of her old}} self, Winton smiled. <b>She</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> everything, pay for everything, bring a whole street of {{children}} down, if it would give her any comfort! ...|$|E
6000|$|Strether made a {{reflexion}} of his own. [...] "I see. That <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> something was, no doubt, inevitable, {{and your}} wife has therefore of course come out to act." ...|$|E
6000|$|But with sublime {{confidence}} in {{the man who had}} saved Pierre and who had given her explicit orders as to what <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do,</b> petite maman, backed by Rosette, reiterated quietly: ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few more}} {{questions}} elicited from Mrs. Hardy {{all that she}} knew of it, and then the warmest commendations were bestowed upon the girls. Ethel, however, generously disclaimed all praise, as she said that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have <b>done</b> nothing at all {{had it not been}} for Maud's steadiness and coolness.|$|R
60|$|Annora {{coloured}} furiously, {{and said}} she did not know what might be esteemed a disgrace in France, but <b>she</b> <b>should</b> certainly <b>do</b> nothing that would disgrace her English name. Then it flashed on me that what had passed in the carriage had been a reality, and I saw what she meant.|$|R
6000|$|Frank came in; {{found that}} Valencia was not down: and, too excited to eat, {{went out to}} walk till <b>she</b> <b>should</b> appear. Neither <b>did</b> Lord Scoutbush come. Where was he? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's fortunate," [...] said Mrs. Glegg. [...] "She {{can agree}} to the list o' things to be bought in. It's but right <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> her share when it's her own brother." ...|$|E
60|$|She bowed in reply, {{and took}} a seat beside the sofa. The Doctor gave her some {{directions}} as to what <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> in case her father should become conscious before his return.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{absolutely}} driven {{her away from}} you, and left her abruptly, so {{that she should have}} no opportunity of imploring you to spare her. And now you expect that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Indeed, I {{gathered}} {{that there}} was nothing coarse or bacchanalian about this worship of a prototype of Aphrodite; on the contrary, that it was more or less spiritual and ethereal. We sat down on the altar stone. I wondered a little that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have <b>done</b> so, but she read my thought, and answered: ...|$|R
6000|$|These {{were days}} of formless imaginings and ambitions. [...] "I will do! I will do!" [...] was her ceaseless cry to herself, {{but what could}} <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> What <b>should</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|R
50|$|It {{would appear}} that the High Court decision, and the dissenting Federal Court judge's opinion, was that {{technically}} whilst the Immigration Minister has the power to deport any non-citizen on grounds of bad character, <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not <b>do</b> so in Stefan's case. All three Federal Court judges were unanimous in their criticism of Senator Vanstone in this case.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well." [...] Marilla's {{crispness}} gave {{no sign of}} her relief. She {{had been}} wondering what under the canopy <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> if Anne did not give in. [...] "I'll take you down after milking." ...|$|E
60|$|She had no {{idea what}} <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>do.</b> If she spoke to a {{policeman}} she did not know what would ensue. Perhaps she would have to charge this man and appear in a police-court next day.|$|E

6000|$|Elizabeth had not forgiven, as <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have <b>done,</b> {{the being}} called stingy; it rankled on her {{feelings}} {{far more than}} those who said the word understood; and she presently went on, [...] "If they knew ever so much, they would only laugh at me, and call it all Bessie's nonsense. Miss Fosbrook, please, what is affectation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I said to Marian. Had {{she refused}} to go up the river with Marmaduke, as <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have <b>done,</b> all this would not have occurred. She will not see it in that light, but lays all the blame on her aunt Julia, whose offer fell {{somewhat}} short of her own notions of providing for the child's future." ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{advised by}} Mr Tenshi {{not to do}} so, Amélie decides to confront Ms Mori {{and talk to her}} personally.
