The club won their second Coppa Italia trophy in 1975–76, eliminating Milan and Fiorentina en route, before beating rivals Hellas Verona 4–0 in the final. In the Italian league, Napoli were <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> consistent top six side {{for much of the}} late 1970s. Even into the earliest two seasons of the 1980s, the club were performing respectably with a third-place finish in 1980–81. However, by 1983, they had slipped dramatically and were involved in relegation battles.|$|E
5|$|Because {{little was}} known about the region, the {{elements}} of its climate, citrus, water, and general ideas about illness and health, Stowe was possibly first among several authors and advertising schemes that portrayed Florida as an exotic place of natural wonders and powers that could rejuvenate frail health. What travel writers published on Florida were exaggerated claims, readily accepted by audiences hungry for escapist literature. Biographer Forrest Wilson considers the finished product, Palmetto Leaves—published in 1873—to be the first promotional writing about Florida ever. Occasionally letters about the state were printed in local newspapers in the North, but because Florida was <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> rugged wilderness, Northerners really had no concept of what the region was like. Rather besotted with the marvelous properties she saw in the orange, Stowe intended to call the book Orange Blossoms, but changed the title to better express the plant that proliferated the region the most.|$|E

25|$|Despite Belfast's {{seemingly}} growing {{significance to}} the English monarchy, it was <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> small settlement at this stage. John Speed's 1610 map of Ireland marks Belfast as an insignificant village, and the 1612 patent styles it a town, or village. Nearby Carrickfergus, successfully held by the English for much longer, was still the more prominent settlement and centre for trade. In 1640 Thomas Wentworth, then Lord Deputy of Ireland, purchased from Carrickfergus its trade monopolies (namely, one third import duty compared with other locations in the kingdom) and bestowed them upon Belfast. The customs house was also relocated to Belfast at around the same time, and new trade flooded into the town, much to {{the expense of the}} prosperity of Carrickfergus.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{generally}} agreed that Ensemble re-created the Halo universe's aesthetic well. Gillen said knowledge of the game universe could alleviate some issues of player ignorance regarding units' actions: [...] "It's not just the geek thrill of seeing a Scarab in action—it's that you understand what the Scarab means on the battlefield (trouble)," [...] he wrote. [...] "We know which characters are best against tanks, and which are probably best in special vehicles." [...] Nguyen said that, although the core units meshed well, the inclusion of Ensemble-developed units gave Halo Wars {{the feeling of a}} generic science-fiction title. While giving the game a mixed review, Anderson said that the authentic-looking units and environments went a long way to integrating the game {{with the rest of the}} series. Wilcox commented that with the Halo-inspired menu system and Rippy's score, [...] "before the campaign even begins, the message is clear: this is <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> Halo game." [...] Overall, Halo Wars was judged a fitting final game for Ensemble.|$|E

He {{attended}} Auckland Grammar School, and won a scholarship to Auckland University College (now the University of Auckland) a year before he was due to finish high school. Faced with a choice between studying history or the sciences, he chose the latter {{because he had a}} severe stammer and thought that it would be less of an impediment. He completed both a Bachelor's degree and a Master's qualification in science, securing Honours in both mathematics and physics, finishing his studies in 1937. Despite these achievements, he did not consider himself to be practically trained, saying: [...] "I was <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> theorist, with no practical physics at all.

500|$|Judicial review, {{the means}} by which the High Court {{controls}} the exercise of legislative and executive power, is part of the Court's supervisory jurisdiction. The basis of this jurisdiction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Ng Chye Huey v. Public Prosecutor (2007) as inherent in nature, that is, deriving from the common law rather than statute. The Court noted that this jurisdiction had [...] "existed historically at common law" [...] and [...] "is <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> part of our judicial system". The inherent power of the High Court to review the decisions of inferior courts and other administrative bodies does not, however, extend to co-ordinate bodies. In other words, one High Court judge may not exercise judicial review over a decision by another High Court judge. In addition, there are no provisions in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act which confer on the Court of Appeal the power to exercise supervisory jurisdiction over the High Court or – as pointed out in Ng Chye Huey – the Subordinate Courts.|$|E

[...] Jamieson Cox of Time and Lauren Murphy of The Irish Times agreed that the song {{is one of the}} album's highlights. Brennan Carley of Spin thought that the song [...] "revels convincingly in its vulnerability" [...] where as Lindsay Zoladz of New York cited [...] "Joan of Arc" [...] as one of the [...] "most affecting songs" [...] on the album for grappling with the feeling of being defeated and fatigued directly. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse was largely positive, declaring that the song [...] "is possibly Madonna’s best ballad since 'Miles Away'—or really since the Music or Ray of Light era." [...] On the other hand, Consequence of Sound's Sasha Geffen had mixed feelings about the song, calling it a [...] "lukewarm love [...] couples easy, inoffensive melodies with historical Christian imagery."

500|$|Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph {{discussed}} the episode's refreshing strong-women theme: [...] "Game of Thrones has been justly criticised for employing young actresses as wobbly-wobbly window dressing and, though the toplessness has been dialed back this season, it's <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> calling card. However {{there are reasons}} for suspecting that the series is attempting to make amends – by arguing that Westeros would be far better off with women in charge. Even as Sansa was turning the tide at Winterfell, in Meereen, Daenerys and Yara Greyjoy were striking up a lady bromance – and seemingly rock-solid alliance – for the ages." [...] Laura Prudom of Variety agreed: [...] "After seasons of criticism over the show's misogyny (sometimes earned, sometimes not), it's thrilling to see an episode like 'Battle of the Bastards', where women like Dany, Sansa and Yara — and emasculated men (either figuratively or literally) like Tyrion and Theon — break the gears {{of war and the}} familiar patterns of violence by attempting to 'leave the world better than we found it', despite the examples set by the evil white cisgendered men who came before them." [...] According to Sarah Larson of The New Yorker, [...] "Sansa watches calmly, then smiles. You've come a long way, baby. Or she's become a monster, and so have I. The women of Westeros are on the warpath." ...|$|E
500|$|Handlen {{felt that}} the {{character}} development of Carl Grimes was more stable than similar developments in the episode; [...] "Using Carl to both resolve the episode’s plot, and making him semi-responsible for Dale’s death, has a satisfying neatness, {{and serves as a}} reminder that for all their talk, Rick and the group have no idea what impact their choices will make." [...] Likewise, Jackson and Ryan Rigley of MTV noticed the darker transition of the character; [...] "Carl's moral compass has greatly shifted since being shot and seeing the walking corpse of his friend, Sophia," [...] asserted Rigley. Jackson concluded {{that it was one of}} the episode highlights, writing, [...] "He awakened from his coma talking about the beautiful doe, but ever since the dead body of Sophia limped its way out of that barn door, he's become colder and harder. When Carol sees him at Sophia’s gravesite, she tries to comfort him with talk of heaven, and he calls her an idiot. He's looking to emulate the men leading the group—the different kinds of toughness displayed by his father, Shane and Daryl. And he finds the chance to test his own bravery, playing near a zombie stuck in the mud by the creek, keeping the discovery to himself." [...] Jackson commented on Carl's reaction to the death of Dale, saying that despite a gradual change to a dark nature, he [...] "realizes [...] that he's <b>still</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> kid".|$|E
5000|$|Recording enough {{songs for}} an album between 1992 and Fall 1994, {{the group had}} to settle on only {{releasing}} two songs from those sessions {{because of a lack}} of funds and hard times for three of the members.
