40|$|During {{the life}} of any gas turbine, blade erosion is present, {{especially}} for those units that are exposed to unfiltered air, such as aviation turbofan engines. The effect of this erosion {{is to reduce the}} blade chord progressively from the midspan to the tip region and to roughen and distort the blade surface. The effects of roughness on rotor performance have been documented by Suder et al. and Roberts. These papers indicate that the penalty for leading-edge roughness and erosion can be significant. Turbofan operators, therefore, restore chord length at routine maintenance intervals to regain performance before deterioration is too severe to salvage blades. As the rotor blades erode, the leading edge becomes rough - blunt and distorted from the nominal shape - and the aerodynamic performance suffers. Nominal performance can be recovered by recontouring the leading edges. This process, which inherently shortens the blade chord, can be used until the blade chord erodes to the <b>stall</b> <b>limit.</b> Below this chord length, which varies among engine-compressor types, a decrease of stall margin is likely. After compressor blade rework that includes leading edge recontouring, the blades have different chord lengths, ranging from blades that are near nominal chord length down to those near the stall chord limit. Furthermore, as blades erode below the <b>stall</b> <b>limit,</b> they must be replaced with new blades that have the full nominal chord length. Consequently, a set of compressor blades with varying chord lengths will be installed into each turbofan engine that goes through a complete maintenance cycle.

40|$|A direct force {{measurement}} technique employing piezoelectric load cells {{is used to}} experimentally investigate a two-dimensional airfoil (NACA 0012) undergoing dynamic stall. The load cells are installed {{at each end of}} the airfoil and give the force response in two directions in the plane normal to the airfoil axis during oscillations. Experiments are carried out at a Reynolds number based on the airfoil chord equal to 7. 7 Ã— 104, and at four reduced frequencies, k= 0. 005, 0. 01, 0. 02, and 0. 04. Phase-averaged lift of the airfoil undergoing dynamic stall is presented. It is observed that hysteresis loops of the lift occur both when the airfoil is pitched to exceed its static <b>stall</b> <b>limit</b> and when it is still within its static <b>stall</b> <b>limit,</b> and they grow in size with increasing k at the same pitching mean angle of attack and pitching amplitude. Both the lift and the drag induced by the pitching motion are further analyzed using the methods of higher order correlation analysis and continuous wavelet transforms to undercover their nonlinear and nonstationary features, in addition to classical FFT-based spectral analysis. The results are quantitatively illustrated by an energy partition analysis. It is found that the unsteady lift and drag show opposite trends when the airfoil undergoes transition from the pre-stall regime to the full-stall regime. The degree of nonlinearity of the lift increases, and the lift show a nonstationary feature in the light-stall regime, while the nonlinearity of the drag decreases, and the drag shows nonstationary feature in both the light-stall and the full-stall regimes.

40|$|A two-spool {{turbojet}} engine was operated in the Lewis {{altitude wind tunnel}} to study the inception of compressor surge. In addition to the usual steady-state pressure and temperature measurements, the compressors were extensively instrumented with fast-response interstage pressure transducers. Thus {{it was possible to}} obtain maps for both compressors, pressure oscillations during rotating stall, effects of stall on efficiency, and stage-loading curves. In addition, with the transient measurements, it was possible to record interstage pressures and then compute stage performance during accelerations to the <b>stall</b> <b>limit.</b> Rotating stall was found to exist at low speeds in the outer spool. Although the stall arose from poor flow conditions at the inlet-stage blade tips, the low-energy air moved through the machine from the tip at the inlet to the outer spool to the hub at the inlet to the inner spool. This tip stall ultimately resulted in compressor surge in the mid-speed region, and necessitated inter-compressor air bleed. Interstage pressure measurements during acceleration to the compressor <b>stall</b> <b>limit</b> indicated that rotating stall was not a necessary condition for compressor surge and that, at the critical stall point, the circumferential interstage pressure distribution was uniform. The exit-stage group of the inner spool was first t o stall; then, the stages upstream stalled in succession until the inlet stage of the outer spool was stalled. With a sufficiently high fuel rate, the process repeated with a cycle time of about 0. 1 second. It was possible to construct reproducible stage stall lines as a function of compressor speed from the stage stall points of several such compressor surges. This transient stall line was checked by computing the stall line from a steady-state stage-loading curve. Good agreement between the stage stall lines was obtained by these two methods...|$|E

In the tested impeller, the separation bubble on the blade suction surface extends alongthe blade leading edge from the blade root to a radial position of the root-mean-square radius at the <b>stall</b> <b>limit</b> flow rate.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and field experimental {{program has been}} carried out to investigate the use of tip devices on horizontal axis wind turbine rotors. The objective was to improve performance by the reduction of tip losses. While power output can always be increased by a simple radial tip extension, such a modification also results in an increased gale load both because of the extra projected area and longer moment arm. Tip devices have the potential to increase power output without such a structural penalty. A vortex lattice computer model was used to optimize three basic tip configuration types for a 25 kW <b>stall</b> <b>limited</b> commercial wind turbine. The types were a change in tip planform, and a single-element and double-element nonplanar tip extension (winglets). A complete data acquisition system was developed which recorded three wind speed components, ambient pressure, temperature, and turbine output. The system operated unattended and could perform real-time processing of the data, displaying the measured power curve as data accumulated in either a bin sort mode or polynomial curve fit.

In the nominally 2 -D configuration, single-pulse actuation can significantly increases the lift over most of the oscillation cycle not only at post-stall but also at angles of attack that are below stall. In the 3 -D configuration, a single pulse can increase the lift during a significant fractions of the oscillation cycle despite the massive separation on the outboard segments of the unactuated airfoil.

40|$|During an {{investigation}} of the J 57 -P- 1 turbojet engine in the Lewis altitude wind tunnel, effects of inlet-flow distortion on engine stall characteristics and operating limits were determined. In addition to a uniform inlet-flow profile, the inlet-pressure distortions imposed included two radial, two circumferential, and one combined radial-circumferential profile. Data were obtained over a range of compressor speeds at an altitude of 50, 000 and a flight Mach number of 0. 8; in addition, the high- and low-speed engine operating limits were investigated up to the maximum operable altitude. The effect of changing the compressor bleed position on the stall and operating limits was determined for one of the inlet distortions. The circumferential distortions lowered the compressor stall pressure ratios; this resulted in less fuel-flow margin between steady-state operation and compressor stall. Consequently, the altitude operating Limits with circumferential distortions were reduced compared with the uniform inlet profile. Radial inlet-pressure distortions increased the pressure ratio required for compressor stall over that obtained with uniform inlet flow; this resulted in higher altitude operating limits. Likewise, the stall-limit fuel flows required with the radial inlet-pressure distortions were considerably higher than those obtained with the uniform inlet-pressure profile. A combined radial-circumferential inlet distortion had effects on the engine similar to the circumferential distortion.

40|$|Airplanes and {{helicopters}} use high aspect ratio wings {{to reduce the}} power required to fly, but must operate at low angle of attack to prevent flow separation and stall. Animals capable of slow sustained flight, such as hummingbirds, have low aspect ratio wings and flap their wings at high angle of attack without stalling. Instead, they generate an attached vortex along {{the leading edge of}} the wing that elevates lift. Previous studies have demonstrated that this vortex and high lift can be reproduced by revolving the animal wing at the same angle of attack. How do flapping and revolving animal wings delay stall and reduce power? It has been hypothesized that stall delay derives from having a short radial distance between the shoulder joint and wing tip, measured in chord lengths. This non-dimensional measure of wing length represents the relative magnitude of inertial forces versus rotational accelerations operating in the boundary layer of revolving and flapping wings. Here we show for a suite of aspect ratios, which represent both animal and aircraft wings, that the attachment of the leading edge vortex on a revolving wing is determined by wing aspect ratio, defined with respect to the centre of revolution. At high angle of attack, the vortex remains attached when the local radius is shorter than four chord lengths and separates outboard on higher aspect ratio wings. This radial <b>stall</b> <b>limit</b> explains why revolving high aspect ratio wings (of helicopters) require less power compared with low aspect ratio wings (of hummingbirds) at low angle of attack and vice versa at high angle of attack...|$|E

The rotor aerodynamic performance was measured at 100, 80, and 60 % of design speed for three blade installation configurations: nominal-chord blades in half of the disk and short-chord blades in half of the disk; four alternating quadrants of nominal-chord and short-chord blades; nominal-chord and short-chord blades alternating around the disk. No significant difference in performance was found between configurations, indicating that blade chord variation is not important to aerodynamic performance above the <b>stall</b> chord <b>limit</b> if leading edges have the same shape. The <b>stall</b> chord <b>limit</b> for most civil aviation turbofan engines is between 94 - 96 % of nominal (new) blade chord...|$|R
50|$|Stall was {{a common}} problem on early jet engines with simple {{aerodynamics}} and manual or mechanical fuel control units, but has been virtually eliminated by better design {{and the use of}} hydromechanical and electronic control systems such as Full Authority Digital Engine Controls. Modern compressors are carefully designed and controlled to avoid or <b>limit</b> <b>stall</b> within an engine's operating range.|$|R
