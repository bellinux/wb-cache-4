Transparent paper is affixed to the verso of these sheets so that light can shine through.

6000|$|But {{go to the}} old Galleries, {{and look}} now at a great Christian painter's {{portrait}} of this fish; for he succeeds {{no better than the}} antediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido's picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his own [...] "Perseus Descending," [...] make out one whit better. The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate leading from the Thames by water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of the old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah's whale, as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these? As for the book-binder's whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor-- as <b>stamped</b> <b>and</b> <b>gilded</b> on the backs and titlepages of many books both old and new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} {{we report on the}} {{restoration}} work for the <b>gilded</b> <b>and</b> painted <b>leather</b> from the Sanctuary of the Santissimo Crocifisso di Papardura in Enna, Italy. The work started with a historical and stylistic examination of the artwork which dates back to 18 th Century. The study of the leather and its decoration was deepened thanks to specific scientific analysis (such as XRF spectroscopy, Raman and SEM) in order to assure the integrity of the material during the restoration work. To this end, a diagnostic procedure was set up to provide a clear picture of constitutive materials (type of leather, silver leaf and pigments), technique, and state of preservation...|$|R

50|$|Memmi's Maestà at San Gimignano is {{striking}} {{in the various}} methods of pastiglia <b>and</b> <b>gilding</b> work used. Golden tin on the throne cusps, laminated tin with gold foil for the halos which are carefully rendered with intricate punchwork, his application of these materials described as “a neat perfection rarely encountered elsewhere”. Examination of the motifs and degree of complexity in the punchwork has allowed historians to recognize the hand of Lippo Memmi and gives a clearer idea of his place in collaborations with Simone Martini. <b>Stamp</b> designs, <b>gilding</b> <b>and</b> the execution of rayed halos are similar, yet show that Lippo Memmi's mature <b>gild</b> <b>and</b> scribe work patterns in the 1317 San Gimignano Maestà {{are rooted in the}} simpler patterns and less developed line he applied to Martini's Maestà of 1315 at the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena.|$|R
