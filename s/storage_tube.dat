25|$|Where {{a single}} brief event is {{monitored}} by an oscilloscope, {{such an event}} will be displayed by a conventional tube only while it actually occurs. The use of a long persistence phosphor may allow the image to be observed after the event, {{but only for a}} few seconds at best. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a direct view storage cathode ray tube (<b>storage</b> <b>tube).</b> A <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> will continue to display the event after it has occurred until such time as it is erased. A <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> is similar to a conventional tube except that it is equipped with a metal grid coated with a dielectric layer located immediately behind the phosphor screen. An externally applied voltage to the mesh initially ensures that the whole mesh is at a constant potential. This mesh is constantly exposed to a low velocity electron beam from a 'flood gun' which operates independently of the main gun. This flood gun is not deflected like the main gun but constantly 'illuminates' the whole of the storage mesh. The initial charge on the storage mesh is such as to repel the electrons from the flood gun which are prevented from striking the phosphor screen.|$|E

The arithmetic unit was built using EF50 pentode valves, which had been widely used during wartime. The SSEM used one Williams tube to provide 32 by 32-bit words of random-access memory (RAM), a second to hold a 32-bit accumulator in which the intermediate results of a calculation could be stored temporarily, and a third to hold the current program instruction along with its address in memory.

A Taiwan {{official}} announced on March 16, 2011 that Taiwan believed China had begun deploying the missiles. The DF-16 represents an increased threat to Taiwan {{because it is more}} difficult to intercept for anti-ballistic missiles systems such as the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-3. [...] Due to its increased range, the missile has to climb to higher altitudes before descending, giving more time for gravity to accelerate it on re-entry, faster than a PAC-3 could effectively engage it. The DF-16 is an MRBM longer and wider than previous models with a [...] warhead and 5-10 meter accuracy. [...] Its bi-conic warhead structure leaves room for potential growth to include specialized terminally guided and deep penetrating warheads.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the pre-analytical factors contributing to uncertainty in thyroglobulin measurement in fluids from fine-needle aspiration (FNA) washout of cervical lymph nodes. We studied pre-analytical stability, in different conditions, of 41 samples prepared with concentrated solutions of thyroglobulin (FNA washout or certified standard) diluted in physiological saline solution or buffer containing 6 % albumin. In this buffer, over time, no changes in thyroglobulin concentrations were observed in all storage conditions tested. In albumin free saline solution, thyroglobulin recovery rates depended on initial sample concentrations and on modalities of their conservation (in conventional <b>storage</b> <b>tubes,</b> recovery mean was 56 % after 3 hours-storage at room temperature and 19 % after 24 hours-storage for concentrations ranged from 2 to 183  μg/L; recovery was 95 %, after 3 hours or 24 hours-storage at room temperature, for a concentration of 5, 656 μg/L). We show here that these results are due to non-specific adsorption of thyroglobulin in <b>storage</b> <b>tubes,</b> which depends on sample protein concentrations. We also show that possible contamination of fluids from FNA washout by plasma proteins do not always adequately prevent this adsorption. In conclusion, non-specific adsorption in <b>storage</b> <b>tubes</b> strongly contributes to uncertainty in thyroglobulin measurement in physiological saline solution. It is therefore recommended, for FNA washout, to use a buffer containing proteins provided by the laboratory...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Storage</b> <b>tubes</b> {{were based}} on CRTs, {{sometimes}} unmodified. They relied on two normally undesirable principles of phosphor used in the tubes. One was that when electrons from the CRT's electron gun struck the phosphor to light it, some of the electrons [...] "stuck" [...] to the tube and caused a localized static electric charge to build up. The second was that the phosphor, like many materials, also released new electrons when struck by an electron beam, {{a process known as}} secondary emission.|$|R
