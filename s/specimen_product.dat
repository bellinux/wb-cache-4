50|$|The {{instruments}} {{produced by}} <b>Specimen</b> <b>products</b> have become highly regarded as both ornate works and quality sound.

50|$|Shrimp Boat was an American {{rock band}} formed in Chicago in 1987. After the band {{dissolved}} in 1993, Sam Prekop and Eric Claridge formed The Sea and Cake.

2500|$|The <b>Specimen</b> <b>Products</b> line of tube-driven {{amplifiers}} {{began with}} the Petimor model, a 10-watt birchwood based amplifier designed to accommodate classical guitar. [...] Also available is the Stereo Amp, which is essentially two Petimors in one case, angled at 25 degrees apart. [...] After a variety of smaller-scale experiments, Specimen released the Horn Amp, a single-tube amplifier fitted with a 24 inch horn {{in order to produce}} stage-performance level volumes.|$|R
50|$|The {{precursor}} to Tar was a hardcore punk outfit called Blatant Dissent, which formed in DeKalb, Illinois where singer/guitarist John Mohr and drummer Mike Greenlees were attending Northern Illinois University. Joining Mohr and Greenlees in Tar were original bassist Tim Mescher (only until 1991 and who also played for Snailboy), bassist Tom Zaluckyj and guitarist Mark Zablocki. Zaluckyj and Mohr played unique instruments, crafted of aluminum, designed by Ian Schneller of <b>Specimen</b> <b>Products.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>Specimen</b> <b>Products</b> employs an {{octagonal}} resonance horn on all speaker boxes, {{intended to}} increase the spatial effect of music played through it. [...] Horn Speakers {{have been made in}} varying sizes, from 3 to 8 feet tall. [...] Specimen has made Horn Speakers in a variety of powers, ranging from 10 or less watt speakers for personal use (such as with an MP3 player) to 70 watt pieces intended for stage performance. [...] Andrew Bird uses a specially-designed Horn Speaker known as the Janus Horn, featuring a two-mouthed horn that spins during operation, giving music played through it a Doppler effect.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, Specimen {{moved to}} a {{storefront}} on Division Street in the Wicker Park neighborhood. At this point Specimen's plans for a production run of 10-Watt amps materialized in the Petimor amplifiers. The Division Street shop allowed for an expanded repair business. Repairing so many guitars from big manufacturers impressed upon Schneller the need for minimalist designs with very durable construction. These tenets have become the standard of <b>Specimen</b> <b>Products</b> designs. The Division Street shop became a prominent show room for the custom instruments, establishing a customer base with many local musicians, {{as well as those}} travelling through the area.|$|R

2500|$|The brand <b>Specimen</b> <b>Products</b> was {{conceived}} by company founder Ian Schneller in 1981, during his undergraduate {{study at the}} Memphis College of Art. [...] After completing his graduate studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Schneller began producing instruments in favor of sculpture. [...] In 1986, as he began producing more instruments for friends and band mates, Schneller established his workshop on Chicago's south-side Archer Street, in a loft rented by his band Shrimp Boat. [...] The first commissioned project Specimen undertook was fulfilling Tar guitarist John Mohr's request for an [...] "indestructible guitar," [...] a task that would develop the company's longstanding experiments with aluminum guitars. [...] The Archer Street facility was creatively productive but Schneller states that he only sold a single unit out of the many produced.|$|R

40|$|Computational design, modeling, and {{simulation}} {{can play}} {{a leading role in}} the development of func-tional nanosystems. Computational methods can describe with useful accuracy a broad range of components that have not yet been realized; hence they can in many instances be used to guide experimental in fruitful directions. Further, computational methods can be used to design multiple components that will fit together to make a functional system. This means of coordinating exper-imental efforts can enable the development of components that gain value from their integration with other components. Scientific and design-oriented applications of computational methods are fundamentally distinct. Although they frequently describe similar physical systems and use simi-lar methods, science, and design address problems that exhibit an inverse relationship between abstract descriptions (theories, designs) and physical systems (<b>specimens,</b> <b>products).</b> This dis-tinction has broad consequences for methodology and for judging the adequacy of computational models. The distinction between the classical protein-folding problem (a scientific challenge) and the inverse folding problem (a design challenge) provides a concrete illustration. Among functional nanosystems, those that perform fabrication have a special role because they can enable the pro-duction of other systems. Ribosomes are a widely exploited example.

40|$|Several {{preparations}} of urobilin and stercobilin {{were investigated}} {{with regard to}} their value as standards for the determination of urobilinogen and urobilin in biologic <b>specimens.</b> <b>Products</b> of commercial origin were found to be impure and therefore unsuitable for this purpose. Absorptivities were measured for solutions of the pigments in 3 % FICI in methanol and for the chromogens, obtained by ferrous hydroxide reduction, in the “quantitative ” and “semiquantitative ” methods for urobilinogen. Ascorbic acid was shown to be effective as a protective agent in filtrates from reduction mixtures. Spectra of urobilinogen-aldehyde, phenolsulfonphthalein, Pontacyl dye mixture and phenolphthalein were compared. Phenolsulfonphthalein is recommended as the artificial standard of choice. The independenceof this procedurefrom instru-mentalconsiderations,within limits, is demonstratedwith the useof this dye. COMMERCIAL UNAVAILABILITY of pure urobilin or stercobiin in the past led to adoption of artificial reference standards in determination of these pigments in biologic specimens by the urobiinogen-aldehyde reaction. Phenolphthalein (1 - 3), phenol red (PSP) (4, 5), bromo-auric acid (6) and a mixture of Pontacyl dyes have been used as artificial standards for this purpose. In 1944, Watson et al. (7) in troduced the mixture of Pontacyl Carmine 2 B and Pontacyl Violet 6 R and, several years later, Watson and Hawkinson (8) corrected the calibration with this mixture for use with the Evelyn photometer. Watson and Hawkinson published absorption curves of urobiinogen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{rapid and}} {{reliable}} method of dolphinfish species identification was designed based on PCR ampli-fication of diagnostic DNA fragments from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. It consisted in a tetra-plex reaction producing a positive control amplicon and species-specific fragments in Coryphaena hippurus and C. equiselis. It was successfully tested in specimens of known identity and in nominal C. hippurus samples among which two C. equiselis were discovered. This approach has significant advantages over other molecular species iden-tification methods and may help in determining species composition of mixed catches, and in forensic and food control applications of dolphinfish <b>specimens</b> or <b>products...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Highly {{abundant}} {{proteins in}} biological fluids such as serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can hinder {{the detection of}} proteins in lower abundance, e. g., potential biomarkers. Commercial products are available for the depletion of albumin and immunoglobulins (Igs), although most of these kits have not been validated for dog samples. The present study therefore examines the use {{of different types of}} depletion kits for dog CSF. FINDINGS: Three kits, with different mechanisms for the depletion of albumin and Igs, were tested with dog CSF <b>specimens.</b> One <b>product</b> significantly decreased the amount of albumin; with all kits, IgG was less efficiently removed than albumin. Mass spectrometry of the fractions eluted from the depletion columns revealed considerable co-depletion of other CSF proteins. CONCLUSIONS: A commercially available depletion kit was identified which depletes albumin and (to a lower extent) immunoglobulins from dog CSF. However, the limited efficacy and the concomitant loss of other proteins from the sample should be taken into account when using this product...|$|R
