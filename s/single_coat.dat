25|$|With 80–90% of {{oil spill}} costs {{invested}} in shoreline cleanup, {{there is a}} search for more efficient and cost-effective methods to extract oil spills from the shorelines. Biodiesel has displayed its capacity to significantly dissolve crude oil, depending on {{the source of the}} fatty acids. In a laboratory setting, oiled sediments that simulated polluted shorelines were sprayed with a <b>single</b> <b>coat</b> of biodiesel and exposed to simulated tides. Biodiesel is an effective solvent to oil due to its methyl ester component, which considerably lowers the viscosity of the crude oil. Additionally, it has a higher buoyancy than crude oil, which later aids in its removal. As a result, 80% of oil was removed from cobble and fine sand, 50% in coarse sand, and 30% in gravel. Once the oil is liberated from the shoreline, the oil-biodiesel mixture is manually removed from the water surface with skimmers. Any remaining mixture is easily broken down due to the high biodegradability of biodiesel, and the increased surface area exposure of the mixture.|$|E

The long-length TFA-MOD YBCO coated conductors have been fabricated by multi-turn reel-to-reel system. Increasing the thickness per <b>single</b> <b>coating</b> in the multi-turn reel-to-reel system is a cost-effective technique for fabrication of the precursor films in the calcination process since it reduces the number of coatings and shortens the processing time.

The narrow road and small curve radius were considered major factors in the accidents, and there was roughness in the road surface between the original and widened sections.

After each accident, damaged sections of the bridge – usually the guardrails, handrails, or bridge entry section – needed to be repaired. A 1989 prime mover accident severely damaged the footpath. Rather than repair the narrow footpath, and given that the railway had been removed, a new pedestrian path was constructed on the ground below the bridge.|$|E

The lag time for release from the double-coated tablets was further reduced to 5 min when the inner coat was neutralised to pH 6. 0 in the presence of 10 % citric acid.

40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of various application methods of one-step self-etch adhesives to microtensile resin-dentin bond strength. Materials and Methods Thirty-six extracted human molars were used. The teeth were assigned randomly to twelve groups (n = 15), according to the three different adhesive systems (Clearfil Tri-S Bond, Adper Prompt L-Pop, G-Bond) and application methods. The adhesive systems were applied on the dentin as follows: 1) The <b>single</b> <b>coating,</b> 2) The double coating, 3) Manual agitation, 4) Ultrasonic agitation. Following the adhesive application, light-cure composite resin was constructed. The restored teeth were stored in distilled water at room temperature for 24 hours, and prepared 15 specimens per groups. Then microtensile bond strength was measured and the failure mode was examined. Results Manual agitation and ultrasonic agitation of adhesive significantly increased the microtensile bond strength than <b>single</b> <b>coating</b> and double coating did. Double coating of adhesive significantly increased the microtensile bond strength than <b>single</b> <b>coating</b> did and there was no significant difference between the manual agitation and ultrasonic agitation group. There was significant difference in microtensile bonding strength among all adhesives and Clearfil Tri-S Bond showed the highest bond strength.

The longitudinal tensile strength of the as-prepared composites was measured at room temperature. In order to study the interfacial thermal stability and microstructure evolution characteristics of the composites, vacuum thermal exposures of the composites were carried out at 800, 900 or 940 °C for different durations. The interfacial microstructures of the as-prepared and thermally-exposed composites were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The results indicate that the C/Mo duplex coating does not only have better thermal stability, but also can further slow down the interfacial reaction of the composites in comparison with the C <b>single</b> <b>coating.</b> The diffusion of a small amount of Mo atoms made the matrix close to the interface have better plasticity, so the tensile strength of the composites can be further improved.
