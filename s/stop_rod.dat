[...] In many ways, the patent of the new Thor washer sounds modern, even today. The patent states that a 'perforated cylinder is rotatably mounted within the tub containing the wash water'. A series of blades lifted the clothes as the cylinder rotated. After 8 rotations on one direction, the machine would reverse rotation to 'prevent the cloths from wadding up into a compact mass'. [...] Drive belts attached to a Westinghouse motor connected to three wheels of different sizes, which moved the drum during operation. The design also included a clutch, which allowed the machine to switch direction, and an emergency <b>stop</b> <b>rod.</b> The new Thor washer was mass marketed throughout the United States beginning in 1908.|$|E
50|$|Rod is {{then sent}} to gain {{intelligence}} on the Lords who have assembled at the fortress of Duke Loguire. On {{his way to the}} fortress Rod encounters a witch of his own age named Gwendylon. Gwen and Rod fall in love but Big Tom tells Rod he should stay away from her. Passing themselves off as minstrels they gain entrance to the fortress and find the old Duke losing his grasp on the other lords. Rod discovers each lord has a new advisor, who are PEST agents. Rod seeks more answers by exploring the haunted areas of the fortress and he encounters ghosts. Thanks to Fess the ghosts give up trying to <b>stop</b> <b>Rod</b> and allow him free access. Rod discovers a passageway behind the Duke's seat in the great hall, which he later uses to save the Duke when the lords turn on him. However the ghosts discover that Gwen had followed Rod and return her to him. Upon saving the Duke, who is then replaced by his son Anselm, they make their escape into the forest and back to the Queen's castle. However, not having the full story, the Queen imprisons the old Duke Loguire for high treason and attempts to imprison Rod and Tom for aiding him until Brom comes to their aid and Cathrine lets them free.|$|E
40|$|A reactor startup is in progress. The Primary Plant Operator (PPO) {{has just}} started {{withdrawing}} regulating group CEAs in Manual-Sequential mode, when the "Withdraw-Insert " switch fails in the WITHDRAW mode (indicative {{of holding the}} switch in the withdraw position). The PPO releases the control switch and notes that regulating group CEAs are continuing to withdraw. The PPO then attempts to trip the reactor by pressing ALL four (4) TCB trip buttons and receives the following indication: * All four (4) "K-relays " on RPS have deenergized. * TCB # 1 and TCB # 2 green lights lit, red light out. * TCB # 3, # 4, # 5, # 6, # 7, # 8 and # 9 red lights lit, green lights out. All other indications are normal for a reactor startup. Which {{one of the following}} describes the result of the above TCB status? A The action taken will trip the main turbine, which will then deenergize the CEA busses stopping the rod withdrawal. B The present TCB configuration will immediately trip all CEAs stopping the rod withdrawal. Do D C Both of the MG Set feeder breakers must be opened from C 04 to <b>stop</b> <b>rod</b> withdrawal. D The main turbine Trip pushbutton on C 05 must be pushed to <b>stop</b> <b>rod</b> withdrawal. Justification A; Wrong- the indication given has only TCBs # 1 & # 2 open and the rest closed. These TCBs are in series and will NOT deenergize either CEA bus if they are the only TCBs open. Therefore the undervoltage trip of the turbine will not occur. B; Wrong- only one of the two lines to one of the two CEA busses has been opened. As each CEA bus has two supply lines, both busses are still powered. C; Correct- EOP- 2525 states that the MG set breakers are to be opened on C 04 if the TCBs don't open when the trip buttons are pushed. D; Wrong- Tripping the main turbine will NOT do anything different than pushing the four trip buttons on C 04, it operates the same circuit...|$|E

25|$|Beginners tend {{to point}} with the rod {{to where they}} want to throw, but the {{movement}} of the hand has to be a controlled speed-up and then come to an abrupt <b>stop.</b> The <b>rod</b> will then start to unfurl and the tip of the rod will reach a high speed in the required direction. The high speed of the rod tip toward the target gives the impulse to make the cast, the abrupt stop and retreat of the rod tip is essential for the formation of a loop. Experienced fishermen also improve the speed of the line leaving the rod tip by a technique called hauling, applying a quick fast pull with the hand holding the line. At the end of the cast when the line is stretched the line as a whole will still have speed and the fisherman can let some extra line through their fingers making a false throw, either forward or backward or to finish the cast and start fishing.|$|R

500|$|Plutonium-238 is {{potentially}} more efficient isotope for nuclear reactors, {{since it has}} smaller critical mass than uranium-235, but it continues to release much thermal energy (0.56 W/g) by decay even when the fission chain reaction is <b>stopped</b> by control <b>rods.</b> [...] Its application {{is limited by the}} high price (about 1000 USD/g).

Finally Kathy tells Donna that the reason she gave her up was because she was the product of rape. Unhinged by this bombshell, Donna goes into a downward spiral. She stalks Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) who only uses her for sex, and when he pits her against his new fling, Cindy Williams (Michelle Collins), the subsequent fights mean she loses her job at the pub; by August 1988, she is homeless. Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) and Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) take pity and allow her to stay with them but after Donna tries to come between them, they throw her out. By September, she is living in an abandoned squat on the Square. After Donna's manipulations are discovered, the community shuns her.

40|$|Thirty {{control and}} 121 brain-damaged {{patients}} with injury restricted to one hemisphere {{were presented with}} a test requiring the placing of a rod, fixed on a support by a hinged joint, {{in the same position}} as a model. Two versions of the test were given, one to be performed with the aid of vision and the other only by touch. The brain-damaged patients were subdivided into the following groups: right hemisphere patients without visual field defect (VFD) : 30; right hemisphere patients with VFD: 20; left hemisphere patients without VFD: 46; left hemisphere patients with VFD: 25. The test modality did not differentially affect the performance of the groups. Both on the visually and on the tactually guided version of the test the right hemisphere group with VFD did significantly worse not only with respect to controls but also with respect to the three other braindamaged groups. The latter, in turn, were not significantly inferior to patients without cerebral damage. It appears, therefore, that when spatial perception is tested at a very basic and simple level, such as the detection of orientation in space of a rod, there is an almost complete dominance of the posterior region of the so-called minor hemisphere. This result must be contrasted with the less striking asymmetry of functions shown in more complex spatial tasks—for example, route finding, copying drawings, block designs—that are failed also by patients with damage to the left posterior area. Normal subjects reproduced the orientation of the rod on the horizontal plane with a constant error which was found to be dependent on the position of the model. Clockwise deviations were made when the model was on the left and counterclockwise deviations when the model was on the right. The constant error was present in left brain-damaged patients too, while it was not significantly different from zero in right brain-damaged patients.

5000|$|While {{there are}} many {{variations}} of the Spey cast, the basic technique is broken down into a few simple actions. With the fly line floating directly downstream, the angler first lifts the line off the water {{with the tip of}} the rod. The angler then sweeps the line backwards just above the water, and allows just the fly and leader to [...] "anchor" [...] the cast by touching the water one to two rod lengths away. This back-cast {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "D-loop", from the curving shape of the line between the anchor and the tip of the rod. While swinging the [...] "D-loop," [...] it is important to make one continuous, deliberate motion with the rod tip climbing at a 45-degree angle off the water. As the D-loop comes around, the cast is completed by firing the line forward with a sharp two-handed [...] "push-pull" [...] motion on the handle of the rod while making an abrupt <b>stop</b> with the <b>rod</b> tip at the end of the cast. The cast is most easily compared to a roll cast in one-handed fly fishing, although by using the fly as an anchor, a Spey cast allows a greater loading of the rod and thus achieves greater distance than a one-handed cast.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether the results of the three-rods test would correlate with the results of static stereopsis tests, used in ophthalmic practice. Methods: This study involved 54 normal subjects, 9 women and 45 men, with ages ranging from 18 to 25 (mean, 20. 8) years. All had visual acuity of 0. 8 or better with or without glasses or contact lenses correction and had no strabismus at the distant (5 m) or near (0. 3 m) fixation.

5000|$|The major {{application}} of plutonium {{has been in}} nuclear weapons, where the isotope plutonium-239 was a key component due to its ease of fission and availability. Plutonium-based designs allow reducing the critical mass to {{about a third of}} that for uranium-235. The [...] "Fat Man"-type plutonium bombs produced during the Manhattan Project used explosive compression of plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal, combined with a central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency. Thus only 6.2 kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. (See also Nuclear weapon design.) Hypothetically, as little as 4 kg of plutonium—and maybe even less—could be used to make a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs. Plutonium-238 is potentially more efficient isotope for nuclear reactors, since it has smaller critical mass than uranium-235, but it continues to release much thermal energy (0.56 W/g) by decay even when the fission chain reaction is <b>stopped</b> by control <b>rods.</b> Its application is limited by the high price (about 1000 USD/g).

40|$|When a globiferous pedicellaria of Sphaerechinus granularis injects its venom, {{the head}} autotomizes whereas the stalk {{remains on the}} test and enters a {{regression}} process with concomitant resorption of its supporting ossicle (i. e. the rod). Scanning electron microscope investigations of the morphological changes undergone by the stereom of resorbing rods show that: (1) resorption proceeds both axially and laterally, and leads to a reduction of approximately 80 % of the original length of the rod, (2) secondary growth of new stereom processes occurs concomitantly with resorption but never ensures even a partial regeneration of the rod, and (3) resorption and secondary growth <b>stop</b> before the <b>rod</b> is totally destroyed leaving a static stump that remains in place up to 190 days. Particular resorption figures result from either the axial or the lateral resorption of the rod shaft. These consist chiefly of terraced conical cupules, dense cylinders and concentric lamellae whose walls or edges are typically made of closely piled and/or aligned subprismatic crystallites. Whatever their location along the rod, these crystallites always organize strictly parallel to the rod axis. Whether the crystallites are mosaic blocks composing larger monocrystalline units or discrete monocrystals themselves is for the moment unclear. A growth model, which accounts for the observed resorption figures, is proposed for the shaft of pedicellarial rods. According to this model, the early growth of the shaft would produce elongated, interconnected trabeculae (initial trabeculae) made of densely piled and perfectly aligned crystallites. Thickening and coalescence of adjoining trabeculae would progressively occur by adjunction around the initial trabeculae of successive and concentric layers of similarly arranged crystallites. Coalescent trabeculae would then be cemented together in a perforate stereom layer by the final deposition of larger crystallite layers surrounding the whole shaft periphery. Growth of secondary stereom processes occurs both in the resorbing rod (here the newly formed processes are resorbed soon {{after they have been}} produced) and in rods where resorption has stopped. These are always irregular processes that localize near or on the actual sites of resorption. It is suggested these processes result from an uncontrolled activation of the skeleton-forming cells in areas where the concentration of calcium ions increases as a consequence of calcite resorption...|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, back on Earth, {{with their}} members running low on energon and slowly being {{captured}} by Skywatch, tension is high amongst the Autobots. After a rescue raid led by Hot Rod results in Ironhide's death, Optimus Prime gives up {{his position as}} leader and surrenders to Skywatch, causing a schism between the Autobots, who split into two groups: one led by Hot Rod, who, taking the name [...] "Rodimus", joins forces {{with a group of}} Decepticons fronted by Swindle in an effort to build a ship and leave the planet, and a second who elect Bumblebee as their new leader, and are soon joined by Ultra Magnus, who determines to arrest Rodimus for treason. More Autobots, fearing they will be arrested by Magnus, also go AWOL, but most of them are captured by Skywatch and used as a bargaining tool by Spike Witwicky to force information out of Optimus Prime. Thundercracker, having been shot down by Skywarp three years previously, starts to develop admiration for Earth and its inhabitants. Although Bumblebee was elected as Autobot leader, he gets little respect, as Autobots strike out on their own or disrespect his authority. A rogue faction within Skywatch contacts the Autobots and sets up a meeting with Bumblebee to enlist the Autobots' help in capturing Decepticons. Bumblebee agrees and the bots are fitted with special badges to cloak them from the main Skywatch force, but when the Colonel orders the capture of Blurr and resentment ensues, the Autobots learn that the badges also have the ability to immobilize them. Meanwhile, Magnus arrives at Hot Rod's camp and attempts to capture Swindle, but is <b>stopped</b> by Hot <b>Rod.</b> He also fails in trying to get Hot Rod to disassemble the ship his party is building to get off Earth. In the battle that follows, Swindle betrays Rodimus and reveals his new creation, Menasor, but the day is saved thanks to Skywatch, with whom Optimus Prime has brokered an alliance, and some timely side-switching from the disillusioned Thundercracker. The disgraced Rodimus flees Earth alone, and the Autobots rally under Bumblebee.|$|R
