40|$|High ambient {{temperatures}} {{affect the}} secretion of sexual hormones in cows and heifers. As a result, {{the frequency of}} <b>silent</b> <b>estrus</b> can reach a high level during summer. In order to analyze the effects of heat stress on sexual behavior in Black and White Romanian heifers, a {{research has been conducted}} on four groups of animals in the pre- and post-AI interval. During spring, in conditions of thermal comfort and under the stimulating influence of increasing photoperiod, 83. 3 % of the heifers showed clear signs of estrus. Exposure to temperatures of 36 - 42 ○C by day and 21 - 31 ○C by night caused anoestrus: the heifers did not respond to repeated estrus-induction treatment. When hot days (33 - 38 ○C) alternated with tolerable temperatures by night (18 - 21 ○C), a normal expression of estrus was noticed in 16. 7 % of the animals, while 33. 3 % experienced weak estrus and 50 % did not exhibit sexual behavior. In conditions of moderate thermal stress, with peaks of daily temperature ranging from 28 to 34 ○C, clear signs of estrus were detected in 25 % of the heifers and weak symptoms in 41. 7 %, while 33. 3 % had silent heat, clinically diagnosed.

40|$|Ten cycling Nigerian West African Dwarf (WAD) ewes {{were used}} to {{determine}} the effect of Trypanosoma congolense infection on the estrous cycle. The estrus of ewes were synchronized using intravaginal progesterone sponges and divided into 2 groups (A and B) of 5 ewes each after 54 days (3 cycles). The ewes in group A were inoculated with blood containing approximately 5 × 105 trypanosomes per ml of blood while ewes in group B served as the uninfected control. All the ewes were monitored from infection till {{the end of the study}} (56 days). Ewes in the infected group had <b>silent</b> <b>estrus</b> with clinical trypanosomosis that was characterized by undulating parasitemia, intermittent pyrexia, anemia and weight loss. There was no statistical (p > 0. 05) difference between the mean estrous cycle length of the infected and the control groups. Estrus behavior of seeking the male, tail wagging, bleating, restlessness, edema of the vulva and mucus discharge from the vulva were observed in both groups at estrus, the basal progesterone profile corresponded with a true estrus rate of 60 % and 90 % for the infected and control groups respectively. However, there were statistical (p < 0. 05) differences in the duration and intensity of estrus between the infected and control groups. The study shows that T. congolense infection affects the estrous cycle of Nigerian WAD but not detrimental to cause serious infertility...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine the relationship between the incidence of anestrus post calving cows and the ambient temperature, months and calving seasons. This study was carried out on an imported dairy herd. The herd comprises of Holstein, Friesian crossbreeds. The results of the study indicated that a total percentage 49. 36 % of the cows suffering from delayed reestablishment of estrus till day 45 post calving while 33. 19 % were suffering from delayed estrus reestablishment till day 65 post calving. Meanwhile, the results of the study revealed an inverse relationship between the ambient temperature and the percentage of cows that showed a delayed in re-establishment of post calving estrus. According to seasonal classification, a higher percentage (66. 3 and 47. 28 %) of anestrus cows post calving till day 45 and 65 post calving subsequently were recorded during winter whereas lower percentage (22. 77 and 1. 98 %) subsequently were recorded during summer. The result of clinical examination (rectal palpation of ovaries) of 241 cows failed to exhibit estrus symptoms revealed that 64. 73 % of these cows were with group inactive ovaries (without corpus luteum) whereas 35. 27 % of these cows were with active ovaries (with corpora lutea), this of cows is recognized as cows with silent and unobserved estrus, statistical analysis of the data indicated that there is no relationship between the unobserved estrus (or <b>silent</b> <b>estrus)</b> with the ambient temperature. The results also showed that high percentage of anestrus post calving cows with inactive ovaries were recorded during winter and autumn (73. 11 and 71. 78 %) subsequently whereas high percentage of anestrus post calving cows with active ovaries were recorded during summer...|$|E
40|$|Reduced {{fertility}} of sows {{during the}} warmer {{period of the}} year is a well-known occurrence in practical production. Namely, during summer months gilts become sexually mature later, the interval from weaning to estrus is prolonged, there is a greater number of postlactation <b>silent</b> <b>estruses</b> anestrias and ovarian cysts, the value of conception is lower, there are more irregular failed fertilizations, there is a higher degree of embryo mortality, and the litter size is smaller. This is why this occurrence presents an important zootechnological, veterinary-medical and economic problem. Most scientific research shows that this phenomenon is a consequence of the effects of an extended daily photoperiod and a higher ambient temperature. However, the degree of the individual effect of these factors has not been determined clearly, or the physiological and endocrinological mechanisms of their action. It is probably not possible completely to avoid the negative influence of seasonal factors on reduced fertility in sows during the summer period. However, it can be significantly alleviated with a regular maintenance technology, diet, hygiene and medical protection of sows. This paper presents knowledge acquired so far on the manifestation of this phenomenon, its physiological and endocrine bases, as well as possibilities for its practical resolving...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{determine}} the cyclicity in yak through plasma progesterone estimation during breeding season as well as non-breeding season because <b>silent</b> or non-detected <b>estrus</b> is very common in this species. Blood samples were collected from yak (n = 8) during peak breeding season (July to November) and from the same animals in non-breeding season (February to March) at a two-day interval for 30 days. Progesterone in plasma was estimated using radioimmunoassay. During breeding season, a high proportion (68 %) of heats went unnoticed as confirmed by plasma progesterone profiles which indicated that <b>silent</b> or weak <b>estrus</b> was prominent in yak cows. The common signs of estrus were, followed and mounted by male yak, standing to be mounted, frequent urination, rising of tail, swelling of vulva, congestion of vulvar mucous membrane, restlessness and alertness, loss of appetite. But no bellowing was observed in any yak at estrus. The plasma progesterone at estrus was very low and reached a peak at day 15 of the cycle and thereafter declined rapidly from four days before estrus to basal levels at estrus. During non-breeding season, although no behavioral symptom of estrus was found in any yak cow, three animals were found to be cycling as confirmed by cyclic change in plasma progesterone concentration in those animals. Our observation throws every doubt on the so called seasonal breeding pattern of yak and warrants more detailed investigation...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} 17 dairy herds in NE Kansas to determine the effectiveness of prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF) for reducing intervals to conception for cows with <b>silent</b> or unobserved <b>estrus.</b> Cows that failed {{to be seen in}} heat so they could be inseminated after calving (Exp. 1) and cows that did not return to estrus after AI and were not pregnant when presented to veterinarian for pregnancy examination (Exp. 2) were assigned alternately to be given PGF or to receive no treatment after detection of a palpable corpus luteum. Cows were inseminated at 72 and 96 hr after PGF treatment if not detected in heat. Intervals from treatment to conception were reduced after PGF treatment. Cows with unobserved estrus can be inseminated sooner and have shorter intervals to conception if PGF is used for reproductive management in association with a routine herd health program...|$|R
30|$|Parity CI and DO were {{significantly}} (p <  0.01) affected by parity. In contrast, Kefena (2006) reported non-significant effect of parity on CI and DO. The general declining trend was observed with {{the advance of}} parity number {{for the length of}} CI and DO after the first parity except for the 3 rd parity which showed a slight but non-significance increase compared to the 2 nd parity. This may calls for preferential treatments of cows for shorter CI and DO. According to Bulman and Wood (1980), the general declining trend of the length of CI and DO with the advance of parity and the incidence of <b>silent</b> <b>estrus</b> was highest in the primiparous cows and decreased with the advance in parity number and higher nutrient requirement for growth in addition to milk production and maintenance thus delays the onset of postpartum heat. The observed general trend of influence of cow parity on CI and DO is in general agreement with the results reported for indigenous and crossbred cows in Ethiopia (Negussie et al. 1998; Demeke et al. Demeke et al. 2004). The cows in their first parity had longest DO (289.02  ±  9.93) (at least P <  0.05) and CI (18.79  ±  0.33) (at least P <  0.05) whereas cows in fifth parity showed shortest DO (212.12  ±  15.54) and CI (16.08  ±  0.52) from the other parities. This result is in agreement to a number of workers, who reported the longest DO (Asheber 1992; Giday 2001) and CI (Giday 2001; Getinet et al. 2009) in young cows which might be due to lower energy balance as they are not able to consume more for their own growth, production, reproduction and maintenance, thus lower energy balance delays the onset of postpartum heat. The shortest calving interval in fifth parity might be due to their physiological maturity that contributed to have shorter CI and DO. Similar significant effect of parity on DO (Giday 2001; Getinet et al. 2009) and CI (Mureda and Zeleke 2007) has also been reported.|$|E
40|$|Because of poor {{reproduction}} {{after the}} lifting of an 8 -year breeding moratorium, a biomedical survey of female lions in U. S. zoos was initiated in 2007. Fecal estrogen (FEM), progestagen (FPM) and glucocorticoid (FGM) metabolites were analyzed in samples collected 3 - 4 times per wk from 28 lions at 17 facilities (0. 9 - 13. 8 yr of age) for 4 mo- 3. 5 yr and body weights were obtained ~monthly from 17 animals at eight facilities (0. 0 - 3. 0 yr of age). Based on FEM, estrous cycle length averaged 17. 5 ± 0. 4 d in duration, with estrus lasting 4. 4 ± 0. 2 d. All but one female exhibited waves of estrogenic activity indicative of follicular activity; however, not all females expressed estrous behaviors (73 %), suggesting <b>silent</b> <b>estrus</b> was common. Female lions experienced puberty earlier than expected; waves of estrogenic activity were observed as young as 1. 1 yr of age, which {{may be related to}} a faster growth rate of captive vs. wild lions. Mean gestation length was 109. 5 ± 1. 0 d, whereas the non-pregnant luteal phase was less than half (46. 0 ± 1. 2 d). Non-mating induced increases in FPM were observed in 33 % of females housed without a male, consistent with spontaneous ovulation. A number of study animals had been contracepted, and the return to cyclicity after treatment withdrawal, while variable, was ~ 4. 0 yr and longer than the 1 -yr expected efficacy, especially for those implanted with Suprelorin. For FGM, there were no differences in overall, baseline or peak mean concentrations among the age groups or across seasons, nor were there any relationships between reproductive parameters and FGM concentrations. Overall, results suggest that poor reproduction in lions after the breeding moratorium was not related to altered adrenal or ovarian steroid activity, but for some females may have been a consequence of individual institutions' management decisions...|$|E
40|$|One {{of the big}} {{obstacles}} in management of reproductive activity in water buffaloes is their <b>silent</b> <b>estrus.</b> This characteristic prevents the determination of time for artificial insemination (AI), resulting in lengthening of the calving interval (Nguyen et al. 1990 Proc. FAO Workshop, Bulgaria, 210 – 216). Pregnancy-associated glycoprotein (PAG) measurement in maternal blood is an effective method of early pregnancy diagnosis in ruminant species (Zoli et al. 1992 Biol. Reprod. 46, 83 – 92). The present study describes a preliminary attempt to improve buffalo reproductive performance by association of three different approaches: synchronization of estrus by hormonal treatment, followed by two AI, and finally pregnancy diagnosis based on PAG measurements. A total of 33 buffalo females (4 to 15 years old), with no apparent estrus {{during a period of}} 9 to 36 months after last calving, were used. Each female received 2 injections of 5 mL of PGF 2 α (Intervet, France) 10 days apart (Day - 12 and Day - 2), one injection of 500 IU of PMSG (SABC, Vietnam) at Day - 5, and 1000 IU of hCG (Intervet, France) on the day of AI (Day 0). A second AI was performed 8 h after hCG injection. Blood samples (9 mL) were collected from each female at Days 20, 25, 40, and 45 after AI. Blood samples were withdrawn by jugular venipuncture (heparinized Vacutainer tubes) and kept in a cool box until centrifugation (500 g, 10 min). Plasma samples were stored at - 20 °C until assayed for PAG. Pregnancy diagnosis was considered negative, doubtful, or positive according to the PAG concentrations (0. 8 ng mL- 1, respectively). Clinical observation of females after insemination showed that the total rate of animals that exhibited signs of estrus until Day 45 was 9. 1 % (3 / 33). These 3 females were not considered for pregnancy diagnosis. Table 1 shows the results of pregnancy diagnosis in 30 water buffalo females. These results show that fertilization is easily obtained after estrus synchronization in buffaloes and that measurement of PAG concentrations in maternal plasma can be used for pregnancy diagnosis from Day 40 after AI.

40|$|Background: In bovines, more {{efficient}} management practices {{are important for}} maximizing profitability. In order to increase the pregnancy rates in artificial insemination (AI) programs, several hormonal protocols were developed to synchronize the follicular wave and the moment of ovulation in beef and dairy cattle. In dairy cattle, detection of estrus can be difficult due {{to a number of}} factors including the incidence of <b>silent</b> <b>estrus.</b> Hormonal treatments designed to control both luteal and follicular function has permitting efficient synchronizations of time of ovulation. Thus, the AI can be performed in a large number of animals on a fixed schedule without the need for detection of estrus. Using these management techniques, the fixed-time artificial insemination (TAI) can overcome the problem of accurate estrus detection and help in reducing the incidence of repeat breeding. In addition, with TAI in cattle operations, it is possible to facilitate management practices and commercialization, and to reduce the time and semen wasting with animals inseminated at incorrect times. The investigation of practical and efficient TAI protocols is important for reducing the labor and animal handling of TAI in dairy cattle, as well as for increasing the profitability of the cattle management system. This study was carried out in order to investigate the effectiveness of TAI in dairy heifers treated with a practical progesterone-based protocol. Materials, Methods & Results: This experiment was conducted at the university farm located in southwestern Brazil, during May 2009. Thirty-nine cycling crossbred dairy heifers were employed in this study. All animals received a single intramuscular injection of estradiol benzoate and intravaginal progesterone releasing device in a random stage of the estrous cycle (Day 0). on day 7 the animals were treated with PGF 2 a analogue and on day 9 the device was removed. Forty-eight hours after the device removal (day 11) a synthetic analogue of GnRH was administered and the animals were fixed-time artificially inseminated at the time of GnRH injection. The inseminations were performed using four different batches from the same Holstein bull. Among the heifers that were synchronized (87. 2 %), 30. 8 % ovulated until 24 h after TAI and 56. 4 % ovulated between 24 and 32 h after TAI. The conception rate was 61. 5 %. No effects of ovulation time in conception rates were detected. The conception rate from heifers that ovulated until 24 h after TAI was 58. 3 % and from heifers that ovulated between 24 and 32 h after TAI was 77. 3 %. The mean of ovulatory follicle in heifers that ovulated until 24 h was 14. 3 mm and in heifers that ovulated between 24 and 32 h was 11. 9 mm. Discussion: Taking together, the findings of the present study, along with those of others, emphasize the concept that development of practical methods for TAI offers significant advantages to dairy producers if conception rates are close or greater to those obtained after breeding at detected estrus. Thus, {{the results of the present}} study reinforce the possibility of making dairy cattle production more cost-effective using TAI. In conclusion, with the progesterone-based TAI protocol of the present experiment all synchronized animals ovulated up to 32 h after GnRH+TAI and no effects of ovulation time related to conception rate was detected. The exogenous control of luteal and follicular development facilitated the reproductive management and animal handling. Also, inseminating the heifers at the moment of GnRH injection in a progesterone-based TAI protocol is a practical strategy and provided satisfactory results regarding ovulation and conception rates in dairy heifers...|$|E
