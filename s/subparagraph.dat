2500|$|Forced child begging {{is a type}} of begging {{in which}} boys and girls under the age of {{eighteen}} are forced to beg through psychological and physical coercion. Begging is defined by the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review as [...] "the activity of asking for money as charity on the street". There is evidence to suggest that forced begging is one industry that children are trafficked into, with a recent UNICEF study reporting that 13% of trafficking victims in South Eastern Europe have been trafficked for the purpose of forced begging. The United Nations protocol affirms that [...] "the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered 'trafficking in persons' even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in <b>subparagraph</b> (a) of this article." [...] With this definition the transportation of a child to an urban center for the purposes of begging constitutes trafficking regardless of whether this process was enforced by a third party or family member. The severity of this form of trafficking is starting to gain global recognition, with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the European Union, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the United Nations, among others, beginning to emphasize its pertinence. [...] The European Union's Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking includes child begging as one form of trafficking, stating [...] "trafficking in human beings is an abhorrent and worrying phenomenon involving coercive sexual exploitation, labor exploitation in conditions akin to slavery, exploitation in begging and juvenile delinquency as well as domestic servitude." [...] This issue is especially difficult to regulate given that forced begging is often imposed by family members, with parental power leveraged over a child to ensure that begging is carried out.|$|E

30|$|All {{substrates}} used in {{this work}} were commercial 2 -in. wafers consisting of a 4 -μm GaN (0001) layer grown on sapphire by MOVPE (Lumilog, Les Moulins, Vallauris, France). These substrates were cleaned in N-methyl-pyrrolidone [NMP] at 90 °C for 30 min, rinsed in isopropanol [IPA], and thoroughly cleared with deionized [DI] water. The mask material always consisted of a 5 - to 10 -nm Ti layer deposited on a clean GaN template by e-beam evaporation. The root mean square [RMS] roughness of the wafer surface before and after Ti deposition was 0.4 ± 0.1 nm {{in an area of}} 1 μm 2. The various techniques used to pattern the Ti mask with ordered arrays of nanoholes are described in detail in the following <b>subparagraphs.</b> Prior to each PA-MBE growth, the distribution, diameter, and depth of the nanoholes were characterized by atomic force miscroscopy [AFM] (Nanoscope III Multimode AFM, Veeco Instruments Inc., Plainview, NY, USA) and scanning electron microscopy [SEM] (CABL- 9500 C, Crestec Co.
