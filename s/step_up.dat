5|$|Heading {{into the}} game against Mike Bellotti's Oregon Ducks, Oklahoma {{defensive}} coordinator Brent Venables made some major changes to the defensive depth chart after giving up four long running plays {{through the heart of}} the defensive line against Washington. The starters at defensive tackle, cornerback, and strong safety were all demoted, opening opportunities for some freshmen to <b>step</b> <b>up.</b> D.J. Wolfe was replaced by Marcus Walker at cornerback while senior Jason Carter started in place of Keenan Clayton at strong safety. Carter replaced Clayton in the game against Washington after a missed tackle by the freshman led to a Husky touchdown on their first offensive play. Even though all four players at defensive tackle had almost the same number of plays, Steven Coleman was moved {{off the top of the}} depth chart as well.|$|E

The use of hemp for rope and fabric later became ubiquitous throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States.

40|$|Background and Purpose. To {{describe}} the timings and ranges of linear displacements of the pelvis and feet occurring {{in a healthy}} older population when <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> onto a <b>step,</b> and to describe variations noted in {{a small sample of}} subjects with hemiplegia. Method. An observational case series study design was used and the study took place in a gait laboratory in a general hospital. A convenience sample of 54 healthy volunteers (mean age 57. 6 years, range 40 - 90 years; 26 males, 28 females) and six subjects with chronic hemiplegia (mean age 61. 7 years, range 47 - 70 years; five males, one female) was recruited. Participants <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> onto an 18 cm step. The following outcome measures were made: kinematic measures of <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> cycle time; pelvic lateral displacement; width of foot base; and height of heel clearance by use of CODA (a three-dimensional movement analysis system). Results. The mean (standard deviation, SD) <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> cycle of healthy subjects was 1. 68 seconds (± 0. 22 seconds). The total range of pelvic lateral displacement during one <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> cycle was 70 mm. Pelvic lateral displacement was asymmetrical, being significantly greater towards the initial weightbearing leg (p< 0. 0001). Older subjects (aged 60 + years) had less heel clearance (p< 0. 03) than younger subjects (aged < 60 years). <b>Stepping</b> <b>up</b> performance by subjects with hemiplegia showed wide inter-subject variability, and was observed to be as much as three times slower, to use as much as four times the range of pelvic lateral displacement and twice the foot base, and to be asymmetrical in timing of the <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> cycle. Conclusions. This kinematic study describes a healthy <b>stepping</b> <b>up</b> pattern not previously reported. Age and hemiplegia influenced the amount and speed of movement adopted during the task. Information about the movement strategies used by the elderly and those with hemiplegia should guide physiotherapists in their management of physical function.
