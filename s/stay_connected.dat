Most forage fish are pelagic fish, {{which means they}} form their schools in open water, and not {{on or near the}} bottom (demersal fish). Forage fish are short-lived, and go mostly unnoticed by humans. The predators are keenly focused on the shoals, acutely aware of their numbers and whereabouts, and make migrations themselves, often in schools of their own, that can span thousands of miles to connect with, or <b>stay</b> <b>connected</b> with them.|$|E

500|$|Berry told {{interviewer}} Kimberly Grant, [...] "The {{hard part}} {{for me was}} to try to <b>stay</b> <b>connected</b> to Phillips and Welson." [...] This was because, Grant writes, [...] "she had to spend an entire day reading 21 pages of dialogue, rattling off in quick succession 911-operator jargon, that would be cut and edited to fit the film... In film terms, that means Berry performed for 21 minutes straight with no breaks, not an easy feat for any actor." [...] Though she enjoyed working with Chestnut, Berry told Grant that it was difficult being unable to see her co-stars for most of the film: [...] "That was my constant challenge; to stay on such an emotional level , so that I would be on the same level as they [...] were. I used that feeling of frustration and of being stuck to fuel my character." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some theorists {{suggest that}} this blurred {{boundary}} of work and life {{is a result of}} technological control.

This type of control, as Barker argues, replaces the more direct, authoritarian control, or simple control, such as managers and bosses. As a result, communication technologies in the temporal and structural aspects of work have changed, defining a [...] "new workplace" [...] in which employees are more connected to the jobs beyond the boundaries of the traditional workday and workplace. The more this boundary is blurred, the higher work-to-life conflict is self-reported by employees.|$|E
