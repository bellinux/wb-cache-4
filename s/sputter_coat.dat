Although {{sputter deposition}} has been largely confined to metals and metal oxides, at least one polymeric material, poly-tetra-fluorethylene, has been demonstrated to produce sputtered fragments which repolymerize upon deposition to produce a highly cross-linked fluoropolymer resembling that of the parent target Fluoropolymer-filled silicon dioxide and fluoropolymer-filled aluminum oxide coatings have been deposited by means of ion beam <b>sputter</b> <b>coat</b> deposition resulting in films having material properties suitable for aerospace and commercial applications.

40|$|The present {{research}} focuses on the coupling of mechanical and electrical properties of materials and culminates in a direct connection between applied strain to thin-films, thin-film electron binding energy, the energy loss via plastic deformation provided by an indentation, and the substrate resistance. The methods used in this research include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nanoindentation, digital optical microscopy, and <b>sputter</b> <b>coat</b> deposition. It is discovered {{that there is a}} shift in electron binding energy on the scale of 0. 2 eV to 1. 4 eV in gold and palladium thin-films sputtered on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) through the application of strain induced by a convex shape. There is a change in the area beneath the load-displacement curve measured via indentation from 5. 55 x 10 ^- 10 J to 4. 78 x 10 ^- 10 J when the gold-palladium thin-film sputtered on PVDF is changed from the flat arrangement to the convex arrangement. Furthermore, the strain also changed the electrical resistance of aluminum foil, which indicates that the substrate electrical resistance is affected by the induced strain. The internal resistance of a circuit developed for this research changed from 7. 76 ohms for flat samples to 8. 03 ohms and 8. 33 ohms for flat and convex samples, respectively. It is expected that the research can be used to estimate the strain in nanogears and other devices at small length scales...|$|E

MATERIALS & METHODS: One hundred and twenty bars of Titanium grade V (25 ± 1 x 3 ± 0. 5 x 0. 5 ± 0. 05 mm) were divided randomly into twelve groups: group 1 no surface treatment, group 2 Gold <b>sputter</b> <b>coating,</b> group 3 TiN <b>sputter</b> <b>coating,</b> group 4 Sandblasting Al 2 O 3 125 μm, group 5 Sandblasting Al 2 O 3 180 μm, group 6 Sandblasting Al 2 O 3 250 μm, group 7 Sandblasting Al 2 O 3 125 μm then gold <b>sputter</b> <b>coating,</b> group 8 Sandblasting Al 2 O 3 180 μm then gold <b>sputter</b> <b>coating,</b> group 9 Sandblasting Al 2 O 3 250 μm then gold <b>sputter</b> <b>coating,</b> group 10 Sandblasting Al 2 O 3 125 μm then TiN <b>sputter</b> <b>coating,</b> group 11 Sandblasting Al 2 O 3 180 μm then TiN <b>sputter</b> <b>coating,</b> group 12 Sandblasting Al 2 O 3 250 μm then TiN <b>sputter</b> <b>coating.</b> Vita Titankeramik porcelain was applied for all groups and built up manually with dimensions limited to 8 x 3 x 1 mm and fired on Ti bars following the manufacturer’s instructions and ISO 9693 recommendations, and tested for bond strength by Schwickerath crack initiation test (ISO 9693) using an Instron universal testing machine (Model: 5566 A). The mode of failure and bond interface were evaluated by SEM / EDS. RESULTS: The mean bond strength values of groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 were 2. 31 MPa (± 0. 2), 24. 3 MPa (± 0. 78), 46. 94 MPa (± 1. 29), 6. 18 MPa (± 0. 98), 9. 46 MPa (± 1. 08), 15. 14 MPa (± 0. 74), 24. 84 MPa (± 1. 73), 36. 24 MPa (± 1. 43), 41. 49 MPa (± 2. 13), 49. 45 MPa (± 0. 96), 69. 36 MPa (± 0. 96), 94. 45 MPa (± 1. 51), respectively. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons test was performed to determine the groups that are statistically different. All tested groups (1 - 12) showed statistically significant difference except groups 2, and 7, P< 0. 05. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1 - Surface finish significantly affects the bond strength of low fusing porcelain to Ti grade V. 2 - Larger Al 2 O 3 particle size corresponded to higher bond strengths. 3 - Sandblasting in combination with Au or TiN coatings produced the highest bond strength values. 4 - Groups 1, 4, 5, & 6 showed Adhesive failure at the ceramic – metal interface; for groups 3, 10, 11, & 12 were found to be Cohesive failure within the porcelain layers; and for groups 2, 7, 8, & 9 were found to be mixed Adhesive / Cohesive failure. 2018 - 09 - 28 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to demonstrate the ability to generate and characterize a nanometer sized aerosol using solutions, suspensions, and a bulk nanopowder, and to research the viability of using an acoustic dry aerosol generator/elutriator (ADAGE) to aerosolize a bulk nanopowder into a nanometer sized aerosol. The research compares the results from a portable scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) to the more traditional method of counting and sizing particles on a filter sample using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Sodium chloride aerosol was used for the comparisons. The <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> thickness, a conductive coating necessary for SEM, was measured on different sizes of polystyrene latex spheres (PSLS). Aluminum oxide powder was aerosolized using an ADAGE and several different support membranes and sound frequency combinations were explored. A portable SMPS was used to determine the size distributions of the generated aerosols. Polycarbonate membrane (PCM) filter samples were collected for subsequent SEM analysis. The particle size distributions were determined from photographs of the membrane filters. SMPS data and membrane samples were collected simultaneously. The <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> thicknesses on four different sizes of PSLS, range 57 nanometers (nm) to 220 nm, were measured using transmission electron microscopy and the results from the SEM and SMPS were compared after accounting for the <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> thickness. Aluminum oxide nanopowder (20 nm) was aerosolized using a modified ADAGE technique. Four different support membranes and four different sound frequencies were tested with the ADAGE. The aerosol was collected onto PCM filters and the samples were examined using SEM. The results indicate that the SMPS and SEM distributions were log-normally distributed with a median diameter of approximately 42 nm and 55 nm, respectively, and geometric standard deviations (GSD) of approximately 1. 6 and 1. 7, respectively. The two methods yielded similar distributional trends with a difference in median diameters of approximately 11 - 15 nm. The <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> thickness on the different sizes of PSLSs ranged from 15. 4 - 17. 4 nm. The aerosols generated, using the modified ADAGE, were low in concentration. The particles remained as agglomerates and varied widely in size. An aluminum foil support membrane coupled with a high sound frequency generated the smallest agglomerates. A well characterized sodium chloride aerosol was generated and was reproducible. The distributions determined using SEM were slightly larger than those obtained from SMPS, however, the distributions had relatively the same shape as reflected in their GSDs. This suggests that a portable SMPS is a suitable method for characterizing a nanoaerosol. The sizing techniques could be compared after correcting for the effects of the <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> necessary for SEM examination. It was determined that the <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> thickness on nano-sized particles and particles up to approximately 220 nm can be expected to be the same and that the <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> can add considerably {{to the size of a}} nanoparticle. This has important implications for worker health where nanoaerosol exposure is a concern. The <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> must be considered when SEM is used to describe a nanoaerosol exposure. The performance of the modified ADAGE was less than expected. The low aerosol output from the ADAGE prevented a more detailed analysis and was limited to only a qualitative comparison. Some combinations of support membranes and sound frequencies performed better than others, particularly conductive support membranes and high sound frequencies. In conclusion, a portable SMPS yielded results similar to those obtained by SEM. The <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> was the same thickness on the PSLSs studied. The <b>sputter</b> <b>coating</b> thickness must be considered when characterizing nanoparticles using SEM. Finally, a conductive support membrane and higher frequencies appeared to generate the smallest agglomerates using the ADAGE technique...|$|R
