40|$|Acid sulfate (a. s.) soils {{constitute}} a major environmental issue. Severe ecological damage {{results from the}} considerable amounts of acidity and metals leached by these soils in the recipient watercourses. As even small hot spots may affect large areas of coastal waters, mapping represents a fundamental step in the management and mitigation of a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> environmental risks (i. e. to target strategic areas). Traditional mapping {{in the field is}} time-consuming and therefore expensive. Additional more cost-effective techniques have, thus, to be developed in order to narrow down and define in detail the areas of interest. The primary aim of this thesis was to assess different spatial modeling techniques for a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> mapping, and the characterization of soil properties relevant for a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> environmental risk management, using all available data: soil and water samples, as well as datalayers (e. g. geological and geophysical). Different spatial modeling techniques were applied at catchment or regional scale. Two artificial neural networks were assessed on the Sirppujoki River catchment (c. 440 km 2) located in southwestern Finland, while fuzzy logic was assessed on several areas along the Finnish coast. Quaternary geology, aerogeophysics and slope data (derived from a digital elevation model) were utilized as evidential datalayers. The methods also required the use of point datasets (i. e. soil profiles corresponding to known a. s. or non-a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> occurrences) for training and/or validation within the modeling processes. Applying these methods, various maps were generated: probability maps for a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> occurrence, as well as predictive maps for different soil properties (sulfur content, organic matter content and critical sulfide depth). The two assessed artificial neural networks (ANNs) demonstrated good classification abilities for a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> probability mapping at catchment scale. Slightly better results were achieved using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) -based ANN than a Radial Basis Functional Link Net (RBFLN) method, narrowing down more accurately the most probable areas for a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> occurrence and defining more properly the least probable areas. The RBF-based ANN also demonstrated promising results for the characterization of different soil properties in the most probable a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> areas at catchment scale. Since a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> areas constitute highly productive lands for agricultural purpose, the combination of a probability map with more specific soil property predictive maps offers a valuable toolset to more precisely target strategic areas for subsequent environmental risk management. Notably, the use of laser scanning (i. e. Light Detection And Ranging, LiDAR) data enabled a more precise definition of a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> probability areas, as well as the soil property modeling classes for sulfur content and the critical sulfide depth. Given suitable training/validation points, ANNs can be trained to yield a more precise modeling of the occurrence of a. s. soils and their properties. By contrast, fuzzy logic represents a simple, fast and objective alternative to carry out preliminary surveys, at catchment or regional scale, in areas offering a limited amount of data. This method enables delimiting and prioritizing the most probable areas for a. <b>s</b> <b>soil</b> occurrence, which can be particularly useful in the field. Being easily transferable from area to area, fuzzy logic modeling can be carried out at regional scale. Mapping at this scale would be extremely time-consuming through manual assessment. The use of spatial modeling techniques enables the creation of valid and comparable maps, which represents an important development within the a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> mapping process. The a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> mapping was also assessed using water chemistry data for 24 different catchments along the Finnish coast (in all, covering c. 21, 300 km 2) which were mapped with different methods (i. e. conventional mapping, fuzzy logic and an artificial neural network). Two a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> related indicators measured in the river water (sulfate content and sulfate/chloride ratio) were compared to the extent of the most probable areas for a. s. soils in the surveyed catchments. High sulfate contents and sulfate/chloride ratios measured in most of the rivers demonstrated the presence of a. s. soils in the corresponding catchments. The calculated extent of the most probable a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> areas is supported by independent data on water chemistry, suggesting that the a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> probability maps created with different methods are reliable and comparable...|$|E

This study aimed at assessing a. <b>s.</b> <b>soil</b> probability maps using two chemical indicators measured in the recipient waters (i. e. sulfate content and sulfate/chloride ratio) for 24 catchments along the Finnish coast.
