25|$|By then, the Spanish Empire {{was engaged}} in the {{political}} aftermath of the Seven Years' War, and colonial priorities in far away California afforded only a minimal effort. Alta California was to be settled by Franciscan Friars, protected by troops in the California missions. Between 1774 and 1791, the Crown <b>sent</b> <b>forth</b> a number of expeditions to further explore and settle Alta California and the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
25|$|The 21 {{northern}} {{missions in}} present-day California (U.S.) were established along California's El Camino Real from 1769. In {{an effort to}} exclude Britain and Russia from the eastern Pacific, King Charles III of Spain <b>sent</b> <b>forth</b> from Mexico a number of expeditions to the Pacific Northwest between 1774 and 1793. Spain's long-held claims and navigation rights were strengthened and a settlement and fort were built in Nootka Sound, Alaska.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventh}} year (of Nebuchadnezzar, 599 BCE) {{in the month}} Chislev (Nov/Dec) the king of Babylon {{assembled}} his army, and after he had invaded the land of Hatti (northern Syria and southern Anatolia) he laid siege {{to the city of}} Judah. On {{the second day of the}} month of Adar (16 March) he conquered the city and took the king (Jeconiah) prisoner. He installed in his place a king (Zedekiah) of his own choice, and after he had received rich tribute, he <b>sent</b> <b>forth</b> to Babylon.|$|E

25|$|The Noldor {{for a time}} besieged Morgoth's {{stronghold of}} Angband, {{resulting}} in the Long Peace. This Peace lasted hundreds of years; during which time Men arrived over the Blue Mountains. But the peace was not to last; {{and one by one}} the kingdoms—even the hidden ones of Gondolin and Doriath—fell. The initial battle that allowed Morgoth's forces to break free of the Siege of Angband was aptly named Dagor Bragollach, or The Battle of Sudden Flame. Morgoth issued flames and lava from Angband which enveloped the surrounding area. A mighty force was then <b>sent</b> <b>forth</b> to break their centuries long siege.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{carried on}} with minor {{variations}} {{for the next}} two nights, with half-hearted parleys carried out in daytime since the Japanese apparently did not dare to attack during the day. In addition to repeating the manoeuvers of the first night, Arima tried a variety of different methods to subdue the ship. First he tried sending two samurai to board the ship in disguise and kill Pessoa on deck, but this failed as the two were not allowed onto the ship. He then sent divers to cut the cables of the ship's anchor, but this was also unsuccessful. On the third night Arima <b>sent</b> <b>forth</b> a flotilla of fire ships, but they all drifted off in the wind save one, which slammed into the bow cable of the carrack but was cleared without much difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Vijaya {{was made}} the prince-regent by his father, {{but he and}} his band of {{followers}} became notorious for their violent deeds. After their repeated complaints failed to stop Vijaya's acts, the prominent citizens demanded that Vijaya be put to death. King Sinhabahu then decided to expel Vijaya and his 700 followers from the kingdom. The men's heads were half-shaved and they were put on a ship that was <b>sent</b> <b>forth</b> on the sea. The wives and children of these 700 men were also sent on separate ships. Vijaya had his followers landed at a place called Supparaka; the women landed at a place called Mahiladipaka, and the children landed at a place called Naggadipa. Vijaya's ship later reached Lanka, in the area known as Tambapanni, on the same day Gautama Buddha died in northern India. Those who believe that Vijaya set out from the west coat of India (i.e. Sinhapura was located in Gujarat) identify the present-day Sopara as the location of Supparaka. Those who believe that Sinhapura was located in Vanga-Kalinga region identify it with places located off the eastern coast of India. For example, S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar speculates that Supparaka might have been same as Sumatra.|$|E

25|$|The Ruta de los Conventos or Monastery Route is {{concentrated}} {{in the south of}} the state, where a number of large religious complexes were built in the early colonial period for evangelization purposes. The Agustino de San Pablo Church and Monastery is located in Yuriria founded by the Augustinians who arrived from Michoacán in the 16th century. It is a monumental fortress-like construction designed by Friar Diego de Chávez y Alvarado and Pedro del Toro and constructed in an area with relatively little population. The monastery became a center from which missionaries would be trained and then <b>sent</b> <b>forth</b> and its size and battlements helped to protect it from Chichimeca attacks. The church retains its original function and Plateresque facade, but the monastery area has been converted into a museum. The Las Capucinas Church and Convent is in Salvatierra and is one of only three complexes built for nuns in the entire state during the colonial period. It has a fortress like appearance and its construction is attributed to Joaquin de Heredia, of the San Carlos Academy. During the Porfirio Díaz presidency, the convent was used as a Civil Hospital and later as a school, which still remains with the name of Colegio José María Morelos. The San Francisco Church and Monastery is in Acámbaro and built between 1734 and 1743. Its facade is Baroque of light pink stone. Inside, the church contains one of the most notable main altars in the Bajio region. It is Neoclassical built of gray and pink stone with gilded details, with an image of the Virgen María Refugio de Pecadores (Virgin Mary Refuge of Sinners), which is replica of an image in Zacatecas.|$|E
25|$|The 1994 {{was to see}} {{yet another}} memorable weekend. Following his win at the Japanese Grand Prix, Damon Hill was now one point behind {{championship}} leader Michael Schumacher. Nigel Mansell, returning to Formula One {{in place of the}} late Senna, was on pole but a poor start resulted in the two championship rivals Hill and Schumacher battling for the lead. But on lap 36, Schumacher went off the track, a result of oversteer, and this allowed Hill to catch up with Schumacher and take the inside line for the next corner. Schumacher turned in on Hill's Williams (whether on purpose or accidentally remains unknown) which sent the Benetton up on two wheels and into the tyre barrier, Schumacher retiring on the spot. Hill came out of the incident with a broken wishbone on his front-left suspension, he pitted and retired from the race, handing the title to Schumacher. The sister Williams of the 41-year-old Nigel Mansell {{went on to win the}} race, becoming the oldest Grand Prix winner since Jack Brabham in 1970. In 1995, Mika Häkkinen suffered a tyre failure at the early part of the first qualifying session at the high speed Brewery Bend between Jones and Brabham Straights, which resulted in him crashing heavily into the outside wall. He was critically injured in the crash and was saved only due to an emergency cricothyroidotomy that was performed by the side of the track by Sid Watkins. This incident forged a strong bond between Häkkinen and team principal Ron Dennis, and also <b>sent</b> <b>forth</b> a new movement for extra safety in the sport. Luckily, Häkkinen recovered fully and was fit to race again in 1996, thus missing only one race. Häkkinen climbed back into a Formula One car at Paul Ricard three months after the accident. The final F1 race at Adelaide was won by Damon Hill in a Williams, almost all of his main rivals including Schumacher retired, and Hill finished two laps ahead of second-placed Olivier Panis.|$|E
500|$|Within {{months of}} Hákon's {{abortive}} campaign, embassies were <b>sent</b> <b>forth</b> from Norway to discuss terms of peace. Meanwhile, Alexander seized {{the initiative and}} made ready to punish the magnates who had supported Hákon. In 1264, Alexander assembled a fleet and made ready to invade Mann. Without any protection from his Norwegian overlord, or from Henry III (who was held captive at the time), Magnús {{had no choice but}} to submit to the demands of the powerful King of Scots. The two monarchs met at Dumfries, where Magnús swore oaths to Alexander, rendered homage, and surrendered hostages. In return for Alexander's promise of protection against Norwegian retribution, Magnús was forced to provide Alexander's navy with several [...] "pirate type galleys"five of twenty oars and five of twelve oars. Alexander then ordered an invasion of the Western Isles, led by Uilleam, Earl of Mar (died ×1281), Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan (died 1289), and Alan Durward (died 1275). According to the thirteenth-century Gesta Annalia I, the Scots invaders plundered and killed throughout the islands; the expedition itself is corroborated by the late thirteenth century Magnúss saga lagabœtis ("The Saga of Magnús the Lawmender"), which indicates that Scottish forces went into the Hebrides and secured the submission of Aonghus Mór amongst others. Another punitive expedition, possibly led by the Earl of Ross, was launched into Caithness and Ross. The submission forced upon the island-magnates, particularly that of Magnús, marked the complete collapse of Norwegian influence in the Isles.|$|E
