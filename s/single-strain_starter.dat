They can be used in <b>single-strain</b> <b>starter</b> cultures, or in mixed-strain cultures with other lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Streptococcus. Special interest is placed on the study of L. lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, as they are the strains used as starter cultures in industrial dairy fermentations. Their main purpose in dairy production is the rapid acidification of milk; this causes a drop in the pH of the fermented product, which prevents the growth of spoilage bacteria. The bacteria also {{play a role in the}} flavor of the final product.Lactococci are currently being used in the biotechnology industry. They are easily grown at industrial scale on whey-based media. As food-grade bacteria, they are used in the production of foreign proteins that are applied to the food industry.|$|E

Food grade gene transfer systems {{were used to}} sequentially superimpose different phage defense systems on this background, resulting in a gradual increase in resistance to bacteriophage in the derivatives. pLP 712, encoding Lac and Prt, was then transferred {{to one of these}} hosts, into which plasmids encoding adsorption inhibition, restriction modification, and abortive infection had already been introduced.

40|$|The {{undefined}} microbial floras {{derived from}} the surface of ripe cheese which are used for the ripening of commercial red smear cheeses have a strong impact on the growth of Listeria spp. In some cases, these microbial consortia inhibit Listeria almost completely. From such undefined industrial cheese-ripening floras, linocin M 18 -producing (lin+) (N. Valdés-Stauber and S. Scherer, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60 : 3809 - 3814, 1994) and -nonproducing Brevibacterium linens strains were isolated and used as <b>single-strain</b> <b>starter</b> cultures on model red smear cheeses to evaluate their potential inhibitory effects on Listeria strains in situ. On cheeses ripened with lin+ strains, a growth reduction of L. ivanovii and L. monocytogenes of 1 to 2 log units was observed compared to cheeses ripened with lin strains. Linocin M 18 activity was detected in cheeses ripened with lin+ strains but was not found in those ripened with lin strains. We suggest that production of linocin M 18 contributes to the growth reduction of Listeria observed on model red smear cheeses but is unsufficient to explain the almost complete inhibition of Listeria caused by some undefined microbial floras {{derived from the}} surface of ripe cheeses...|$|E
40|$|Cheese {{making is}} {{a process in which}} enzymatic {{coagulation}} of milk is followed by protein separation, carbohydrate removal, and an extended bacterial fermentation. The number of variables in this complex process that influence cheese quality is so large that the developments of new manufacturing protocols are cumbersome. To reduce screening costs, several models have been developed to miniaturize the cheese manufacturing process. However, these models are not able to accommodate the throughputs required for systematic screening programs. Here, we describe a protocol that allows the parallel manufacturing of approximately 600 cheeses in individual cheese vats each with individual process specifications. Protocols for the production of miniaturized Gouda- and Cheddar-type cheeses have been developed. Starting with as little as 1. 7 mL of milk, miniature cheeses of about 170 mg can be produced and they closely resemble conventionally produced cheese in terms of acidification profiles, moisture and salt contents, proteolysis, flavor profiles, and microstructure. Flavor profiling of miniature cheeses manufactured with and without mixed-strain adjunct starter cultures allowed the distinguishing of the different cheeses. Moreover, <b>single-strain</b> adjunct <b>starter</b> cultures engineered to overexpress important flavor-related enzymes revealed effects similar to those described in industrial cheese. Benchmarking against industrial cheese produced from the same raw materials established a good correlation between their proteolytic degradation products and their flavor profiles. These miniature cheeses, referred to as microcheeses, open new possibilities to study many aspects of cheese production, which will not only accelerate product development but also allow a more systematic approach to investigate the complex biochemistry and microbiology of cheese makin...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} peptide accumulation and bitterness in reduced- and full-fat Cheddar cheeses that were manufactured with <b>single-strain</b> Lactococcus lactis <b>starters</b> that had distinct cell envelope proteinase specificities. Micellar electrokinetic capillary electrophoresis of aqueous cheese extracts detected three large peaks, designated O, P, and Q, that eluted with peptide standards and increased in area during cheese maturation {{in a pattern}} that was distinct for each starter. Regression analysis of bitter flavor scores from trained sensory panels and individual OQ peak areas suggested that peaks P and Q had a negative and positive correlation, respectively, to this defect. Then, HPLC, capillary electrophoresis, peptide sequencing, and mass spectrometry were used to identify five peptides from αS 1 -casein (CN), one from β-CN, and one from αS 2 -CN that accumulated in 6 -mo-old cheeses. Most of the peptides derived from αS 1 -CN (f 1 – 23) accumulated {{in a manner that}} corresponded with starter proteinase specificity. All of the peptides identified in the study except αS 2 -CN (f 1 – 21) eluted in the O-P-Q region of micellar electrokinetic capillary electropherograms. The αS 1 -CN (f 1 – 16), αS 1 -CN (f 1 – 17) and β-CN (f 193 - 209) eluted in peak O, αS 1 -CN (f 1 – 13) and αS 1 -CN (f 1 – 14) eluted in peak P, and αS 1 -CN (f 1 – 9) eluted in peak Q...|$|R

The content of {{carbonyl compounds}} produced by kefir starter {{was greater than}} that produced by kefir grains. The maximum acetaldehyde concentration (18. 3 mg g 1) in kefir with starter culture was mainly due to the metabolic activity of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP 1 isolated from kefir grains. The highest diacetyl production activity was recorded in the starter culture (1. 87 mg g 1) and the single-strain culture St. thermophilus T 15 (1. 62 mg g 1), followed by Lb. helveticus MP 12 (0. 85 mg g 1) and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis C 15 (0. 42 mg g 1). The lactobacilli Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP 1 and Lb. helveticus MP 12 produced acetone, which was {{not found in the}} cocci cultures. The presence of 2 -butanone was related to the production ability of Lb. helveticus MP 12. In comparison, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis C 15 synthesized ethyl acetate more actively than the other single-strain cultures included in the starter. S. cerevisiae A 13 produced ethanol and CO 2 in amounts (3975 mg g 1; 1. 80 gL 1) that lent cultured kefir distinctive flavour and aroma characteristic of authentic kefir...|$|R

Sodium reduction from foods {{has been established}} {{as a public health}} priority. Cheddar cheese is a food targeted for this reduction because of its relatively high salt content of 600 mg sodium/ 100 g cheese. Among the roles of salt in Cheddar cheese, inhibition of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms is a critical one. Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen commonly found in dairy processing facilities that could easily contaminate Cheddar cheese. Additionally, a bioterrorism agent that is able to survive pasteurization, such as Bacillus anthracis could be intentionally added to cheese. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of sodium reduction on the ability of L. monocytogenes and B. anthracis to survive in Cheddar cheese. Stirred curd Cheddar cheese was manufactured at full, reduced, and low sodium concentrations using two separate, <b>single-strain</b> <b>starter</b> cultures. In the reduced and low sodium treatments, curds received an application of either sodium chloride only, or sodium chloride with potassium chloride (KCl) to replace the effect of sodium chloride on water activity. After manufacture, cheese was analyzed for composition and aged. One week after manufacture, cheese samples were separately inoculated with L. monocytogenes and with spores of B. anthracis (at a level of 4 and 3 log CFU/g respectively), and stored at 4 ° or 12 °C for 27 to 63 days. Microbiological testing of the cheese for pathogen survival, and natural microbial counts took place in three phases. Naturally present microorganisms included total aerobic count, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) count, and and natural spore forming bacteria count The first stage of testing was run immediately after manufacturing, and simulates results of contamination during the cheesemake. During the first phase of testing, the L. monocytogenes population declined by 4 log CFU/g over 60 days of storage at 4 °C. No difference based on starter culture or salt treatment was observed. The count of B. anthracis spores declined by 1. 25 log CFU/g during this same storage period. The second and third phases were conducted shortly after the completion of phase one and simulate post aging contamination of the cheese—both accidental and intentional. In the second and third phases of testing, the pH of the cheese had risen from an initial measurement of 4. 7 to 5. 1 and continued to rise throughout testing to 5. 3. The survival of L. monocytogenes and B. anthracis was improved during these stages. The population of L. monocytogenes declined by only 1. 5 to 2. 5 log CFU/g (depending on stage), with few differences in population based on salt treatment. Under these same conditions, the B. anthracis spore counts declined by only 0. 5 to 1 log CFU/g (depending on the stage), with few differences based on salt treatment. The survival of total aerobic, LAB and spore-forming bacterial counts was not affected by sodium reduction. These data suggest that the low salt levels used in this study did not affect the survival of L. monocytogenes or B. anthracis at the experimental incubation temperatures, compared to controls. It follows that sodium reduction may not compromise the safety of food products like Cheddar cheese. These results may offer some assurance for the food industry to move forward in meeting sodium reduction initiatives. However, this progression must take place with caution. Although sodium reduction did not enhance the survival of the organisms, L. monocytogenes and B. anthracis were still capable of surviving in Cheddar cheese. This observation stresses the requirement of pH control during cheese manufacture, adherence to good manufacturing practices, careful handling of products to prevent them from becoming contaminated in post processing operations such as slicing or shredding, and protection of product from intentional adulteration...|$|E
40|$|Yeast is {{the main}} driving force behind many food {{fermentation}} processes, including the production of beer, wine, sake and bread. Historically, these processes originate from uncontrolled, spontaneous fermentation reactions that rely on a complex mixture of microbes present in the environment. Because such spontaneous processes are inherently inconsistent, inefficient {{and the presence of}} undesired spoilage microbes regularly leads to the formation of off-flavors, most of todays industrial production utilizes defined starter cultures, often consisting of a specific domesticated strain of S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus, or S. pastorianus. Although this practice greatly improved process consistency, efficiency, and overall quality, the choice for a particular yeast strain for a specific industrial application is often based on historical, rather than scientific grounds, often resulting in the commercial application of a suboptimal strain. Moreover, new biotechnological yeast applications, such as the production of second-generation biofuels and other biochemicals, or the controlled fermentation of cocoa for the production of chocolate, confront yeast with completely new environments and challenges. Therefore, this study aims to identify or develop novel, superior yeast variants for both new and traditional fermentation processes. In the first chapter, we give a detailed, comprehensive literature overview of the natural biodiversity of Saccharomyces yeasts, describe the history of <b>single-strain</b> yeast <b>starter</b> cultures and discuss several methods to developed artificial yeast variants with altered characteristics. In Chapter 2, we describe the large-scale phenotypic investigation (mainly focusing on stress tolerance, aroma production and fermentation characteristics) of a broad collection of genetically diverse Saccharomyces yeasts originating from various niches. This way, we were able to identify some interesting patterns and correlations, and revealed some systematic differences between natural strains (so-called non-domesticated or wild strains) and strains from synthetic (man-made) fermentation environments (domesticated strains). For example, we were able to show that the production of fruity acetate esters is significantly higher in domesticated compared to natural strains, hinting towards positive selection for this trait during domestication. Moreover, the resulting dataset allowed selection of phenotypically interesting yeast strains directly employable in specific industrial settings, such as the selection of highly osmo- and ethanol-tolerant wine and wild strains for the production of second generation bioethanol. In Chapter 3 and 4, we further use this dataset as a platform to select parental strains for further phenotypic improvement through large-scale breeding programs. In these experiments, we mainly target the yeasts ability to produce high concentrations of isoamyl acetate (IA), the main responsible for the fruity flavors in fermented foods and beverages. This way, novel hybrid strains were developed for the production of highly aromatic ale beers (Chapter 3). Interestingly, many of these newly developed beer yeasts showed a strong heterosis effect for IA production, while retaining their overall fermentation performance. Additionally, novel hybrid yeasts for the production of specialty chocolate were produced (Chapter 4). These new variants combine beneficial traits from both parental strains: robustness in a cocoa environment and a high production of fruity aroma compounds. In a final chapter, we used Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping to identify genetic factors underlying the immense differences in IA production observed in S. cerevisiae strains. The genetic mechanisms underlying this complex (but industrially highly relevant) trait are currently insufficiently studied and identification of superior alleles might enable more targeted approaches of strain improvement, such as genetic engineering or marker-assisted breeding. In conclusion, this work provides a global overview of the Saccharomyces phenome (with the main focus on industrially relevant traits) and the exploitation of the resulting dataset for the development of superior yeast variants and the investigation of the genetic factors underlying natural diversity of aroma production. nrpages: 172 status: publishe...|$|R
