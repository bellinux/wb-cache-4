40|$|During {{the current}} global {{financial}} crisis, <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> spreads for both developed and emerging market economies widened dramati-cally. This deterioration has {{been attributed to}} the adverse impact of both large public interventions in support of domestic financial systems and fiscal stimulus packages, which led to rapidly growing public debt and balance sheet risks. Countries with large debt stocks and unsound banking sectors were affected the most. These developments have prompted renewed interest in the determination of <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> spreads. This chapter sheds light on this topic by investi-gating the short- and long-run effects of fundamental (macroeconomic) and temporary (financial market) factors on <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> spreads. Many studies have examined the relationship between <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> spreads and various macroeconomic indicators and variables (see, for exam-ple, Baldacci, Gupta, and Mati 2008; Eichengreen and Mody 1998; Kamin and Kleist 1999; and Min 1998).

40|$|The paper {{examines}} contagion {{between the}} <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> markets of six Eurozone countries (France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and Portugal) {{in the period}} from January 2000 to August 2011. A multinomial logistic model is applied to analyze contagion based on measuring joint occurrences of large yield changes (i. e., co-exceedances), while controlling for developments in common and regional factors th at affect all <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> markets simultaneously. I found that the Eurozoneʼs stock markets (EUROSTOXX 50) returns, United Statesʼ Treasury note yields, and the Euro - U. S. dollar (EUR - USD) exchange rate significantly impact the probability of extreme posi tive yield moves in the Eurozoneʼs <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> markets. Positive EUROSTOXX 50 returns and upside moves in U. S. Treasury note yields increased the probability of extreme positive <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> yield moves in the Eurozone, whereas {{an increase in the}} EUR-USD exchange rate significantly reduced the probability. Conditional volatility in the Eurozone stock markets and the money market interest rate do not significantly impact the probability of extreme yield increases in the Eurozoneʼs <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> markets. Furthermore, the probability of observing exceedance across Eurozone <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> markets increased dramatically during the Eurozone debt crisis compared to the pre-crisis period.

Asymmetry of correlation is investigated pair-wise by applying the test of Yongmiao Hong, Jun Tu, and Guofu Zhou (2007). Whereas the test of Hong, Tu, and Zhou (2007) is static, the present paper provides also a dynamic version of the test and identifies time periods when the correlation of Eurozone <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> yield dynamics became asymmetric. We identified seven pairs of <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> markets for which the null hypothesis of symmetry in correlation of <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> yield dynamics can be rejected.

We also test for ˝pure˝ spillovers between <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> yield dynamics, i. e. the spillovers after controlling for common and regional factors that impact the <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> yield changes of all countries simultaneously. To verify if the nature of spillovers has changed {{after the start of}} the euro are sovereign debt crisis, we test for the nonlinear spillovers for the whole observed period and separately for the period be fore and after the start of the euro area sovereign debt crisis (period from the start of April 2010 until the end of our sample, i. e. 31 August 2011). The results of our study show that strong bi-directional Granger causality exists between the investigated <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> markets. Very similar results are obtained whether the regional and world factors are or are not controlled for. We find strong bi-directional non-linear Granger causality for the investigated euro area countries prior the euro area sovereign debt crisis. After the start of the euro area sovereign debt crisis the interdependence be- tween the markets has reduced. We can no longer detect non-linear spillovers running from Germany and France to the ˝periphery˝ euro area countries. The findings of this study have important implications for the policymakers as they show that shocks spill-over quickly across the <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> markets and the intensity and nature of spillovers can change throughout time.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{applies the}} Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012) {{spillover}} methodology to euro area <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> markets. Our analysis identifies different phases of interaction in those markets in recent years. We find {{a substantial increase}} in spillover between euro area <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> markets coinciding with the bailout of Bear Stearns in March 2008. The phase of the euro area crisis from the first Greece bailout in May 2010 until the end of 2011 saw a reversal of the longstanding pattern whereby events in core euro area member state <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> markets exercised a positive net influence on the periphery. In particular, the first Greece bailout coincided with significant positive net spillover from peripheral member states to the core countries. More recently, improved market conditions have seen the pre- 2008 pattern re-established with the core having a stronger net impact on peripheral euro area <b>sovereign</b> <b>bond</b> markets. The analysis points to Greece having become relatively detached from other bond markets since its second bailout in March 2012. The spillover index and its components can be updated on an ongoing basis as new data become available and can provide useful information to policymakers and analysts alike. ...|$|R
