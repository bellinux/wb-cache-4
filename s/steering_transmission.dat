40|$|The main {{target of}} a {{steering}} system is that the driver can change vehicle trajectory {{in accordance with the}} desired direction.  Power steering has become a standard feature in automobile.   It provides assisting power when the driver turns the steering wheel. The well-known power steering types include; Hydraulic Power Steering (HPS), Electro - Hydraulic Power Steering (EHPS), and Electric Power Steering (EPS). EHPS or EPS uses an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) which is specific for each vehicle. The ECU should be able to regulate power of electric motor to provide corresponding assisting power for the steering wheel. Therefore ECU requires input signals, one of which is vehicle wheel angle that can be indicated from the vehicle steering wheel angle. Incremental type of Rotary Encoder (RE) is used in steering angle sensor on a minibus. RE specification used was 60 pulses per rotation and the minibus <b>steering</b> <b>transmission</b> specification is 3. 5 round of right wheel off angle to the left wheel off angle. So we get the RE angular resolution 6 ºper pulse and 105 number of pulses to half of the <b>steering</b> <b>transmission</b> ratio. Repeatability then tested against to a steering angle counter module. Testing is done with a test cycle consisting of 3 repetitions: condition center of the steering wheel, the steering wheel is turned to full right, then to the full left, then back to the right up to the steering wheel center. The results obtained 2 pulses deviation, or equivalent to 12 º of steering angle. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} {{application of}} a quantum-inspired adaptive wavelet shrinkage (QAWS) technique to mechanical vibration signals {{with a focus on}} noise reduction is studied in this paper. This quantum-inspired shrinkage algorithm combines three elements: an adaptive non-Gaussian statistical model of dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) coefficients proposed to improve practicability of prior information, the quantum superposition introduced to describe the interscale dependencies of DTCWT coefficients, and the quantum-inspired probability of noise defined to shrink wavelet coefficients in a Bayesian framework. By combining all these elements, this signal processing scheme incorporating the DTCWT with quantum theory can both reduce noise and preserve signal details.

40|$|Through {{the work}} of {{researchers}} {{and the development of}} commercially available products, automated guidance has become a viable option for agricultural producers. Some of the limitations of commercially available technologies are that they only automate one function of the agricultural vehicle and that the systems are proprietary to a single machine model. The objective of this project was to evaluate a controller area network (CAN bus) as the basis of an automated guidance system. The prototype system utilized several microcontroller-driven nodes to act as control points along a system wide CAN bus. Messages were transferred to the <b>steering,</b> <b>transmission,</b> and hitch control nodes from a task computer.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} satisfy the {{agricultural}} demond of rice transplanting, the transplanter work should guarantee the escapement even in straight line transplanting that is convenient for field management and harvest later. Because of variable soil conditions and hard work environment, the driver driving level and the long boring driving to follow line is a big influence {{to the accuracy of}} the rice transplant. It is easy to produce overline, leak line and cause losses in yield. Aimed at above problem, this text introduces an automatic navigation system developed on PZ 60 rice transplanter based on global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The <b>steering,</b> <b>transmission</b> and transplanting control system of the rice transplanter were modified from manual control system to electro-hydraulic control system using electro-hydraulic proportional valve. According to the position information of the rice transplanter acquired from GNSS receiver and vehicle sensors, the close-loop feedback control system of steering was builded. The system can accurately control rice transplanter to follow row navigating and turn around at the end of field by the self-adaptive fuzzy control method. The road and field experiment results indicated that the lateral tracking error could be kept within 100 mm when the speed of the rice transplant is not greater than 1. 0 m/s. The control system can satisfy the requirment of rice transplanting...|$|E
40|$|As {{compared}} to driving on Earth, {{the presence of}} lower gravity and uneven terrain on planetary bodies makes high speed driving difficult. In order to maintain ground contact and control vehicles need to be designed with special attention to dynamic response. The challenge of maintaining control on the Moon was evident during high speed operations of the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) on Apollo 16, as at one point all four tires were off the ground; this event {{has been referred to}} as the Lunar Grand Prix. Ultimately, computer simulation should be used to examine these phenomena during the vehicle design process; however, experimental techniques are required for the validation and elucidation of key issues. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the methodology for developing a scale model of a lunar vehicle using similitude relationships and to test how vehicle configuration, six or eight wheel pods, and local tire compliance, soft or stiff, affect the vehicles dynamic performance. A wheel pod consists of a drive and <b>steering</b> <b>transmission</b> and wheel. The Lunar Electric Rover (LER), a human driven vehicle with a pressurized cabin, was selected as an example for which a scale model was built. The scaled vehicle was driven over an obstacle and the dynamic response was observed and then scaled to represent the full-size vehicle in lunar gravity. Loss of ground contact, in terms of vehicle travel distance with tires off the ground, was examined. As expected, local tire compliance allowed ground contact to be maintained over a greater distance. However, switching from a six-tire configuration to an eight-tire configuration with reduced suspension stiffness had a negative effect on ground contact. It is hypothesized that this was due to the increased number or frequency of impacts. The development and testing of this scale model provided practical lessons for future low-gravity vehicle development...|$|E
