Soon after, Peter returns to find the dance almost abandoned except for Mary Jane, who is dancing with another boy. Downtrodden, he is reassured when Mary Jane walks up to him and tells him that she saved the last dance for him.|$|E

With no information on how the disease was spread, hospital staff were often reluctant to handle AIDS patients, and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all.|$|E

5|$|Although O'Malley was {{loyal to}} his {{employees}}, {{he did not}} take kindly to demands from employees such as manager Charlie Dressen's request for a three-year contract. When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. Then when he hired Walter Alston as a replacement, he made it clear to the press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in the national media. There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts in the fall and <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the spring to find out his salary. O'Malley also did not support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{discharge}} from military service, Groza {{reported to the}} Browns' training camp in Bowling Green, Ohio. He <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> army fatigues carrying all his clothes in a duffel bag. There, he joined quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie to form {{the core of the}} new team's offense. Groza was mainly a placekicker in his first two years with the Browns, but he played a big part in the team's early success. In his first season, he set a professional football record for both field goals and extra points. The Browns, meanwhile, advanced to the AAFC championship against the New York Yankees. Groza sprained his ankle in the game and missed three field goals, but Cleveland won 14–9. Behind a powerful offense led by Graham, Motley and Lavelli, the Browns finished the 1947 season with a 12–1–1 record and made it back to the championship game. Groza, however, was injured and could only watch as the team won its second championship in a row.|$|E

5|$|On St Andrew's Hill, to the north-west of Cullompton town centre, two Roman forts were {{discovered}} in 1984 by aerial photography carried out for Devon County Council. The earlier, smaller fort (the boundary ditches of which <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> cropmarks) was later replaced by a second, larger fort. The ramparts of this second fort are preserved on two sides as modern field boundaries with substantial earthen banks with hedges on top. The banks on the other two sides were removed shortly before the site was recognised as Roman. The site was made a scheduled monument in 1986. The aerial photography also revealed two subsidiary military enclosures or annexes to each fort. In 1992 a geophysical survey {{was made of the}} fort and areas to the east and west and this was followed by a trial excavation {{to the west of the}} site. These confirmed the existence of two forts, and the ditch of the second fort was excavated. Pottery from the site was dated from around 50–70 AD, which is consistent with a previous date of before 75 AD based on finds from fieldwalking. A Roman settlement near Shortlands Lane was excavated in 2009. A large quantity of Roman pottery, burial remains and fragments of hypocaust tile from the second and third century was found.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} matches was between John Cena versus Sabu in an Extreme Rules lumberjack match, a standard match {{with the exception}} that the ring {{is surrounded by a}} group of wrestlers not directly involved in it and competed under hardcore rules. On the television debut of ECW on Sci Fi on June 13, a brawl broke out between Rob Van Dam and Edge. Edge, who stormed through the ECW crowd, was attacked by Cena, who cost Cena the WWE Championship at ECW's One Night Stand, and written into the storyline, sought revenge against Edge. Following the attack, Cena went to ringside where he knocked ECW Representative Paul Heyman unconscious, after Heyman awarded the pinfall win to Van Dam at One Night Stand. Following the attack, Heyman announced that all ECW superstars would be at Raw the following week. The following week on Raw, Heyman appeared alongside ECW superstar, Balls Mahoney, who was booked to face Cena in a singles match. The match was won by Cena after he made Mahoney submit. After the match, Cena was attacked by ECW superstar Sabu, who in the premiere of ECW on Sci Fi won a 10-man Extreme Battle Royal, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner, where the winner would face Cena at Vengeance in a singles match. Sabu assaulted Cena in which he performed a leg drop on Cena, diving onto him and putting Cena through the Raw announcers' table. The following night on an episode of ECW on Sci Fi, Cena <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the ECW locker room, where he challenged Sabu to an Extreme Rules lumberjack match, for which Sabu accepted.|$|E
