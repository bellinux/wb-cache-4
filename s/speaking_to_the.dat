5|$|After impressing {{with the}} {{reserves}} in 2001, Hall {{was drafted by}} Essendon with the 46th selection in the 2002 AFL Rookie Draft, thereby placing him on the Bombers' rookie list. <b>Speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Mercury, Hall described the opportunity as exciting said that {{it has always been}} his dream to play in the AFL. In the lead-up to the 2002 season Hall played in all three of Essendon's pre-season matches, of which the Bombers lost every game. Rookie listed players must be promoted to the senior list before they play a senior AFL match, so Hall began the 2002 season playing in the VFL for Essendon's reserves team.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{shortly before}} the U.N. Headquarters {{underwent}} major renovations, Del Toro and Soderbergh shot the scenes of Guevara <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.N. General Assembly in 1964. The director wanted to shoot {{the first part of}} The Argentine in Cuba, but was prevented from travelling there by the U.S. government's embargo. Doubling Santa Clara proved to be difficult because it was a certain size and had a certain look. Soderbergh spent four to five months scouting for a suitable replacement, looking at towns in Veracruz/Yucatán before settling on Campeche, which had the elements they needed.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Thursday, April 16, 1948, the Leaf players were greeted by thousands of Toronto fans as they got off the train from Detroit. They then rode open cars through a cascade of multi-coloured paper and ticket tape through Toronto's business district {{to arrive at a}} civic reception at City Hall. <b>Speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> huge crowd, Conn Smythe announced that Kennedy was succeeding Syl Apps as captain who was retiring.|$|E
5|$|The media hype he has {{encountered}} has led Tavares to remain guarded when <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media, while his teammates and family attempt to shield {{him from the}} spotlight where they can. However, Tavares {{is regarded as a}} natural leader on the ice, and a player who puts his team first. The Oshawa Generals named Tavares their team captain in 2008, while he also served as the alternate captain with the Canadian junior team in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of the 2004 NRL rookies, including Hunt, had been much anticipated. After a few games, his peers and the media singled Hunt out as the next superstar of the game. To minimise the impact of excessive media pressure on Hunt's performance, Bennett banned him from <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media. Hunt scored four tries in the Round 17 clash with the South Sydney Rabbitohs, equalling the team record. His form earned him the Brisbane Broncos and Dally M Rookie of the Year awards.|$|E

5|$|The series {{attracted}} {{criticism for}} making generalizations about sexual identity, namely that homosexual men are inherently more fashionable and stylish than heterosexuals. Among those making this critique were Tom Shales in the Washington Post ("stereotypes on parade"), Richard Goldstein in Village Voice ("Haven't fags always been consigned {{to the role}} of body servant?") and United States Congressman Barney Frank <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New York Post.|$|E

He holds her hand as he raps his verse, the milk package falls from her hand as she holds his, thus spilling milk on the floor. When Drake's verse is over, Rihanna pushes him and walks away with a smile.|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{also served}} as a charter member of the first American Civil Liberties Union chapter {{organized}} in the South in the 1950s. She lent her support to the Equal Rights Amendment, <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> legislature in Tallahassee urging them to ratify it. In the 1980s Douglas lent her support to the Florida Rural Legal Services, a group that worked to protect migrant farm workers who were centered on Belle Glade, and who were primarily employed by the sugarcane industry. She wrote to Governor Bob Graham in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions the migrant workers endured. The same year, Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center, which had been housed in hot dog stands, needed a building of its own. The center received a portable building until 1991 when the Florida Department of Education endowed $1.8million for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center in Crandon Park. Douglas co-founded the Friends of the Miami-Dade Public Libraries with her longtime friend Helen Muir, and served as its first president.|$|E

5|$|In 1842 England, a {{young boy}} builds a snowman, but refuses {{to play with the}} other {{children}}. The snowman starts <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boy, repeating his assertions that the other children are silly. Fifty years later, the boy has grown up to be Dr. Walter Simeon, proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute. He hires men to collect samples of snow, which he places in a large snow-filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated snowmen. The Doctor, still despondent after losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams, has parked his TARDIS above Victorian London among the clouds. He uses his allies Vastra, Jenny, and Strax to keep people away from him. They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{motorcyclist}} fires {{shots at}} the moving car of Lewis and Falsone; the two narrowly avoid injury and the motorcyclist escapes. Almost immediately afterward, Lewis and Falsone are called to investigate {{the shooting death of}} a woman on a nearby street. At the scene they find Stivers (Toni Lewis), who was <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woman when she was shot; police later conclude Stivers was the real target. While Munch and Kellerman are leaving the hotel, somebody opens fire on them and shoots Kellerman in the arm. Falsone suggests the shooter is targeting the detectives {{who were involved in the}} previous fatal shooting of drug dealer Luther Mahoney. Kellerman becomes angry when Falsone questions the report of Mahoney's death, which indicates Kellerman shot Mahoney to save Lewis; Falsone said autopsy reports indicate Mahoney was beaten badly.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{signed off}} on all of Zahorchak's proposals except for his call to remove four principals in exchange for up to $15million in federal grants that mandate leadership or staff changes {{as a condition for}} receiving the money. Zahorchak proposed transferring the principals from the Allen and Dieruff high schools, Central Elementary and Harrison-Morton Middle School to the district's nonprofit foundation, then use the federal grant money to open a special school for advanced placement and honors students. The committee did not vote or comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak said he still planned to pursue the plan but apologized for <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media about it on October 12 before discussing it with the district and staff, a move that caused angst among the staff and some members of the public.|$|E

5|$|The gender-based {{criticism}} has also affected younger male {{fans of the}} show, such as with Michael Morones above. Another story that gained national attention was that of Grayson Bruce, a nine-year-old fan who was told to stop bringing a Rainbow Dash backpack to school to prevent bullying that he was receiving. An online campaign to show support for Grayson gained over 32,000 supporters on its Facebook page, and the brony fanbase, the show's creators and voice actors, and various news commentators like Glenn Beck, Ronan Farrow and Eugene Volokh have stood up for the boy's actions. The school later revised its decision after <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> family and clarifying it {{was not trying to}} blame the student for the incident.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{served as}} {{chairman}} from 1955 to 1961; under him were three other selectors, who varied throughout his period as chairman, and the serving England captain. Among Allen's priorities were to promote attacking batsmanship, good fielding, and for the team to bowl overs more quickly. While looking for new batting talent, Allen often promoted young amateur batsmen; several emerged in this period, including Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey, who had successful careers and {{were part of a}} strong English batting line-up. At least one member of the England team, Jim Laker, resented the preference of amateurs, whom he believed were paid more for playing than the professionals. Many professional cricketers thought that Allen was a snob who preferred to keep them in their place; critics believed that he deliberately restricted the career of Les Jackson for reasons of class. Allen also played the role of disciplinarian. Several of the England players enjoyed a hectic social life; it was often left to Allen to issue warnings when they transgressed. He played an active role in home Test matches, generally attending at least three of the five days of every game, discussing tactics with the captain, and <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press. In his first season, Allen was involved in the appointment of a new captain; Len Hutton, the serving captain, retired from the team with injury. In his place, the selectors appointed May, who served until 1959 and again in 1961; he and Allen established a good working relationship. When May was absent from the team with illness during parts of 1960 and 1961, Cowdrey replaced him.|$|E
