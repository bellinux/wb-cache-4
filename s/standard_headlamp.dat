5000|$|The 1969 restyle [...] "added more heft to {{the body}} as width and length again increased. Weight went up {{markedly}} too." [...] Due to the larger body and revised front end styling, the 1969 models (but less so in 1970) had a notable aggressive stance. The 1969 models featured [...] "quad headlamps" [...] which disappeared {{to make way for}} a wider grille and a return to <b>standard</b> <b>headlamps</b> in the 1970 models. This switch back to <b>standard</b> <b>headlamps</b> was an attempt to tame the aggressive styling of the 1969 model, which some felt was too extreme and hurt sales, but 1969 production exceeded the 1970 total.|$|R
2500|$|Headlamps {{must be kept}} {{in proper}} {{alignment}} (or [...] "aim"). Regulations for aim vary {{from country to country}} and from beam specification to beam specification. In the US, SAE <b>standard</b> <b>headlamps</b> are aimed without regard to headlamp mounting height. This gives vehicles with high-mounted headlamps a seeing distance advantage, at the cost of increased glare to drivers in lower vehicles. By contrast, ECE headlamp aim angle is linked to headlamp mounting height, to give all vehicles roughly equal seeing distance and all drivers roughly equal glare.|$|R
50|$|Also new for the 2014 model year, the Grand Caravan R/T gained <b>standard</b> auto <b>headlamps</b> {{with black}} bezels and the Security Group {{featuring}} remote start and security alarm.|$|R

50|$|Challenger and Commander models came <b>standard</b> {{with single}} <b>headlamps,</b> {{the first time}} since 1961 that a Lark-based vehicle offered them. Dual lamps were an extra-cost option.|$|R
50|$|In 1984, the Department {{changed the}} rule to allow replaceable-bulb {{headlamps}} of nonstandard shapes. However, some automaker could equip a vehicle {{with the same}} type of headlamps in the US as {{in the rest of the}} world. US <b>headlamp</b> <b>standards</b> are governed by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, which is incompatible with the UNECE standards, used in most of the rest of the world. Canada has its own <b>headlamp</b> <b>standards</b> that are similar to the US standard but allows UNECE-compliant headlamps. Headlamps were used in cars but also for traffic violation stops.|$|R

50|$|On 1 December 1976, a van {{version of}} the Reliant Kitten was announced, sharing {{the profile of the}} Kitten Estate but using a {{prototype}} nose of the original Reliant Kitten using 7 inch lucas round headlamps (instead of the Kitten's <b>standard</b> square <b>headlamps)</b> along with blank panels in place of the rear windows behind the B-pillar thus making a van, other changes included a black vinyl interior with an optional extra of a rear bench seat which folded flat.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 42 - 48) Night {{vision enhancement}} systems (NVES, which use infrared (IR) cameras, {{are designed to}} supplement the visibility provided by <b>standard</b> <b>headlamps.</b> There are two main NVES systems: active, near infrared (NIR) systems, which require an IR source but give a complete picture of the scene {{in front of the}} driver, and passive, far infrared (FIR) systems, which do not need an IR source but only enhance relatively warm objects (such as people and animals). There are three main display alternatives: a contact analog display with the camera view superimposed on the direct view of the road by means of a head-up display (HUD), a separate HUD {{on the top of the}} dashboard, and a head-down display (HDD) in the dashboard. This report analyses what a NVES should do to improve night visibility based on night crash statistics, driver vision and visibility conditions in night driving, driver tasks and behavior, technological approaches, costs, and regulations. Potential problems with using NVES are also discussed. Finally, issues requiring future research are presented. The six main questions that need to be answered concerning NVES are: What kind of information should be presented? To whom should the information be presented? Which technological approach should be used? When should the information be presented? How should the information be presented? Where should the information be presented...|$|R
50|$|For 1965, the Commander {{was offered}} in two- and four-door sedan form {{along with a}} Wagonaire. The Cruiser four-door sedan was still available, as was the Daytona Wagonaire. The Daytona convertible, hardtop and four-door sedan models were all discontinued, however. Aside from the Wagonaire, the only other 1965 Daytona was the vinyl-roofed two-door sports sedan, which drew its {{inspiration}} from the late-1964 Commander Special. All models continued the 1964 design with only minor detail changes, the most significant being that the Commander gained <b>standard</b> quad <b>headlamps,</b> replacing the dual lamps that had been standard the previous year.|$|R
25|$|There was no {{requirement}} in Europe for headlamps of standardized size or shape, and lamps could be designed in any shape and size, {{as long as}} the lamps met the engineering and performance requirements contained in the applicable European safety <b>standards.</b> Rectangular <b>headlamps</b> were first used in 1961, developed by Cibié for the Citroën Ami 6 and by Hella for the German Ford Taunus. They were prohibited in the United States where round lamps were required until 1975. Another early headlamp styling concept involved conventional round lamps faired into the car's bodywork with aerodynamic glass covers, such as those on the 1961 Jaguar E-Type, and on pre-1967 VW Beetles.|$|R
2500|$|... "Prest-O-Lite" [...] {{acetylene}} {{lights were}} {{offered by a}} number of manufacturers as standard equipment for 1904, and Peerless made electric <b>headlamps</b> <b>standard</b> in 1908. A Birmingham firm called Pockley Automobile Electric Lighting Syndicate marketed the world's first electric car lights as a complete set in 1908, which consisted of headlamps, sidelamps and tail lights and were powered by an eight-volt battery.|$|R
50|$|The <b>standard</b> Jewel-Eye LED <b>headlamps</b> each use 5 {{separate}} LED light sources (4 low beam, 1 high beam) with 10 polished lenses (8 low beam, 2 high beam). The headlights {{no longer}} swivel through corners {{as they did}} on the previous generation RL. The hood, front fenders, and outer door panels are made from aluminum, aluminum use in the RLX saves a total of 79.1 lbs over steel components.|$|R
50|$|Like the RLX and MDX, the TLX comes <b>standard</b> with LED <b>headlamps,</b> also amber LED {{turn signal}} {{indicators}} {{incorporated into the}} side mirrors and rear LED brake lamps. Overall length compared to the previous TL was reduced by 3.8 inches while the wheelbase maintains the same length. As with the 9th generation Accord the TLX loses the front double wishbone suspension of the TSX and TL {{replacing it with a}} MacPherson strut arrangement.|$|R
2500|$|The GS 450h (GWL10), {{rated at}} [...] and now using an Atkinson cycle design, has a 35 percent {{improvement}} in fuel economy {{over the previous}} generation GS 450h, and has a higher combined EPA fuel efficiency rating (31 mpg) than the 306 horsepower GS 350 (23 mpg). Trunk space is improved both for the hybrid and standard models. The GS 450h features <b>standard</b> full LED <b>headlamps</b> and a bamboo trimmed interior. The vehicle was unveiled in 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show.|$|R
25|$|The 2013 models gain a new {{front end}} sheet metal along with <b>standard</b> HID <b>headlamps,</b> {{along with a}} new LED tail light assembly. Performance changes include twin fuel pumps (a Mustang GT’s single supply pump, twice over), larger fuel injectors, a grippier and larger-diameter clutch, a larger fan, a three-row {{intercooler}} (the previous car used a double-row unit), a beefed-up Tremec 6060 six-speed with an internal oil pump, and a single-piece carbon-fiber driveshaft. Larger Brembo front disc brakes with six-piston calipers, reinforced axle tubes, and aero tweaks to help the car reach 200+mph safely. Ford says the changes {{have resulted in a}} 14-percent reduction in drag and a 66-percent increase in front-end downforce. Also new for 2013 is a larger front anti-roll bar and retuned springs. An rpm-adjustable electronic launch-control function is standard, as is four-mode electronic stability control.|$|R

Both models are mated to a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic transmission with sequential shift. It also gets power and economy modes. Existing variants received a <b>standard</b> halogen <b>headlamps</b> and keyless entry, while top of the line V gets LED projector headlamps and LED daytime running lights, as well as a push engine start/stop button. The Audio system unit is available for these existing models, while the latter is also gets touchscreen infotainment system. On the side, the 2016 Innova continued to be manufactured at Toyota's assembly plant in Santa Rosa, Laguna, rolled out on 14 April 2016 and went on sale across Toyota's Philippine dealerships later.|$|R
2500|$|Between 2009 and 2010, {{development}} {{took place}} on further updates to the second generation S-197. In late 2010 design work (by Robert Gelardi) was frozen, with prototypes being first spotted in May 2011. On November 2, 2011, Ford unveiled the 2013 model year Mustang. The 2013 model year Mustang exterior was updated with a new front fascia featuring a larger grille, <b>standard</b> HID <b>headlamps</b> and two LED accent strips adjacent to the headlamp lens. Models equipped with the Pony Package offered LED lighting mounted on the sideview mirrors that produce a projection of a running horse on the ground, 18" [...] wheels, and lower valence foglamps. In the rear, LED tail lamp clusters included sequential turn signals (as with 2010-2012 Mustangs) and a reverse indicator light integrated within the brake light. The trunk lid included a black panel that united {{the left and right}} tail lamp clusters. Several new wheel designs were offered.|$|R
50|$|The GH6 version {{produced}} a rated output of 6 V, 0.33 A (2 W) from a 20-pole ring magnet with a stator having a continuous winding. Original headlamp bulbs are 6 V, 0.25 A (1.5 W) (e.g., CRY5) and a rear bulb of 6 V 0.04A (0.24W) (e.g., CRY8). This {{is different from}} a modern standard bicycle dynamo, though replacements can still be had. Common substitutions are the modern <b>standard</b> 2.4 W <b>headlamp</b> bulb and a tail lamp bulb of 0.6 W. One rider reports much more light with a 6.3 V, 0.25 A (1.6 W) type 40 bulb.|$|R
25|$|The 2013 {{models have}} various {{improvements}} and differences {{compared to the}} GT500 of 2012 including new front end sheet metal along with <b>standard</b> HID <b>headlamps,</b> along with a new LED tail light assembly. The new 2013 Shelby GT500 also has no grill, due to the massive amount of cooling required for the vehicle. Performance changes include twin fuel pumps (a Mustang GT’s single supply pump, twice over), larger fuel injectors, a grippier and larger-diameter clutch, a larger fan, a three-row intercooler (the previous car used a double-row unit), a beefed-up Tremec 6060 six-speed with an internal oil pump, and a single-piece carbon-fiber driveshaft.

50|$|The most {{significant}} changes in the facelifted Perodua Myvi would amount to the increased equipment and kit levels across the range. The 1.3L and 1.5L models are differentiated with unique bumpers and alloy rims. The 1.3L Standard G model, the base model of the range, is fitted with a simple radio with CD-player head unit, while the more expensive 1.3L Premium X and 1.5L SE models add MP3/WMA, USB and Bluetooth functions. The range-topping 1.5L Advance variant is equipped with a multimedia system and navigation, as well as a reverse camera. Both 1.3L models are fitted with standard fabric seats, while the 1.5L SE sports fabric semi-bucket seats, which is leather-wrapped in the 1.5L Advance. Additionally, all models {{with the exception of the}} 1.3L Standard G feature front corner sensors. The 1.3L models are fitted with <b>standard</b> halogen <b>headlamps,</b> whereas the 1.5L variants feature projector headlamps with guide lights, a first for a B-segment Malaysian-made car. Other new additions include the well-received anti-snatch hook first seen in the Perodua Axia, as well as a retractable cup holder under the driver's right side air-cond vent.|$|R
2500|$|In 1983, {{granting}} a 1981 petition from Ford Motor Company, the US headlamp {{regulations were}} amended to allow replaceable-bulb, nonstandard-shape, architectural headlamps with aerodynamic lenses that could {{for the first}} time be plastic. This allowed the first US-market car since 1939 with replaceable bulb headlamps: the 1984 Lincoln Mark VII. These composite headlamps were sometimes referred to as [...] "Euro" [...] headlamps, since aerodynamic headlamps were common in Europe. Though conceptually similar to European headlamps with non-standardized shape and replaceable-bulb construction, these headlamps conform to the SAE <b>headlamp</b> <b>standards</b> of US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, and not the internationalized European safety standards used outside North America. Nevertheless, this change to US regulations largely united headlamp styling within and outside the North American market.|$|R
25|$|There are two {{different}} beam pattern and <b>headlamp</b> construction <b>standards</b> in use in the world: The ECE standard, which is allowed or required in virtually all industrialized countries except the United States, and the SAE standard that is mandatory only in the US. Japan formerly had bespoke lighting regulations similar to the US standards, but for {{the left side of}} the road. However, Japan now adheres to the ECE standard. The differences between the SAE and ECE <b>headlamp</b> <b>standards</b> are primarily in the amount of glare permitted toward other drivers on low beam (SAE permits much more glare), the minimum amount of light required to be thrown straight down the road (SAE requires more), and the specific locations within the beam at which minimum and maximum light levels are specified.|$|R
25|$|For the U.S. market {{only the}} Prius Two, Three, Four and Five will be offered. The Prius Two gains new 15-inch wheel covers and {{standard}} LED Daytime Running Lights (DRL). The Prius Three adds a standard three-door Smart Key entry system, and the Prius Four features <b>standard</b> auto on/off <b>headlamps.</b> The Prius Four also provides enhanced comfort with new SofTex-trimmed seats and an eight-way power adjustable driver's seat. The premium Prius Five model's Advanced Technology Package includes the Premium HDD Navigation System, plus the Head-up Display, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, Pre-Collision System and Lane Keep Assist. The Pre-Collision System retracts the front seatbelts and applies the brakes in certain conditions when it determines that a crash is unavoidable. Lane Keep Assist {{can help the}} driver stay within the lane.|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} market-weighted {{trends in}} the availability of daytime running lights (DRLs) on the best-selling vehicle models in the U. S. for model years 2000, 2004, and 2007. Also presented are analyses of how DRLs are implemented on current vehicles. The availability of DRLs as standard equipment in our samples has increased from 29 % in 2000 to 46 % in 2007. The current availability depends on vehicle type. For example, there are still few vans equipped with DRLs (13 %), but they have become a common feature on passenger cars (61 %). For vehicles with DRLs as <b>standard</b> equipment, low-beam <b>headlamps</b> {{are the most common}} type of implementation (39 %); in terms of trends by vehicle type, passenger cars most frequently use reduced-intensity high-beam headlamps (55 %) ...|$|R

50|$|The 1960 Cadillacs had smoother, more {{restrained}} styling. General changes {{included a}} full-width grille, {{the elimination of}} pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint {{in the application of}} chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. External variations on the Seville two-door hardtop and Biarritz convertible took the form of bright body sill highlights that extended across the lower edge of fender skirts and Eldorado lettering {{on the sides of the}} front fenders, just behind the <b>headlamps.</b> <b>Standard</b> equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows, six-way power seats, heater, fog lamps, Eldorado engine, remote control trunk lock, radio with antenna and rear speaker, power vent windows, air suspension, electric door locks, license frames, and five whitewall tires. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Chadwick cloth or optional Cambray cloth and leather combinations. The last Eldorado Seville was built in 1960.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flagship}} Ford Expedition Platinum will be {{more upscale}} and move further upmarket, with high-end interior fit-and-finish and luxury interior and exterior appointments.
