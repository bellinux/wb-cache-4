25|$|Salmon {{eggs are}} laid in {{freshwater}} streams typically at high latitudes. The eggs hatch into alevin or <b>sac</b> <b>fry.</b> The fry quickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical stripes. The parr stay {{for six months}} {{to three years in}} their natal stream before becoming smolts, which are distinguished by their bright, silvery colour with scales that are easily rubbed off. Only 10% of all salmon eggs are estimated to survive to this stage. The smolt body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in salt water. Smolts spend a portion of their out-migration time in brackish water, where their body chemistry becomes accustomed to osmoregulation in the ocean.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of an {{anadromous}} salmon begins and, if it survives the full course of its natural life, usually ends in a gravel bed in {{the upper reaches of}} a stream or river. These are the salmon spawning grounds where salmon eggs are deposited, for safety, in the gravel. The salmon spawning grounds are also the salmon nurseries, providing a more protected environment than the ocean usually offers. After 2 to 6 months the eggs hatch into tiny larvae called <b>sac</b> <b>fry</b> or alevin. The alevin have a sac containing the remainder of the yolk, and they stay hidden in the gravel while they feed on the yolk. When the yolk has gone they must find food for themselves, so they leave the protection of the gravel and start feeding on plankton. At this point the baby salmon are called fry. At {{the end of the summer}} the fry develop into juvenile fish called parr. Parr feed on small invertebrates and are camouflaged with a pattern of spots and vertical bars. They remain in this stage for up to three years.|$|E
500|$|Cutthroat trout usually inhabit and spawn {{in small}} to {{moderately}} large, clear, well-oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They are {{native to the}} alluvial or freestone streams typical of tributaries of the Pacific Basin, Great Basin and Rocky Mountains. They spawn in the spring, as early as February in coastal rivers and as late as July in high mountain lakes and streams. Spawning begins when water temperatures reach [...] Cutthroat trout construct a redd in the stream gravel to lay eggs. The female selects the site for and excavates the redd. Females, depending on size, lay between 200 and 4,400eggs. Eggs are fertilized with milt (sperm) by an attending male. Eggs hatch into alevins or <b>sac</b> <b>fry</b> in about a month and spend {{two weeks in the}} gravel while they absorb their yolk sack before emerging. After emergence, fry begin feeding on zooplankton. Juvenile cutthroat trout typically mature in three to five years. Lake-resident cutthroat trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation for good food production. Lake populations generally require access to gravel-bottomed streams to be self-sustaining, but occasionally spawn on shallow gravel beds with good water circulation.|$|E
40|$|Disease and {{parasite}} outbreaks cause {{mortality of}} fish, affecting mostly {{early stages of}} fish cycle. The outbreaks are usually prevented using a number of chemicals including salt (NaCl) for which protocols are lacking. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the efficacy of NaCl as a potential prophylactic treatment and its short term toxicity on African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) yolk-sac and swim-up fry during a 24 h exposure period. Three-day-old yolk sac and six-day-old swim-up fry (n = 50 for each stage) were subjected to static bath dip treatment in increasing concentrations of NaCl (0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 8, 1. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0, and 10. 0 g/L) for 15, 30 and 60 min. Toxic ranges were tested by exposing the fry stages to concentrations of 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0, 1. 25, and 1. 50 g/L NaCl for 24 h. Controls were not subjected to any concentration of NaCl. All experiments were executed in triplicate. Regardless of the concentrations and duration of exposure, survival of fish in NaCl treatment differed significantly (P < 0. 05) from the untreated controls. Effective concentration ranges of NaCl were 0. 2 – 0. 8 g/L and 0. 2 – 1. 0 g/L in the yolk <b>sac</b> and swim-up <b>fry</b> respectively at exposure duration of 15 min. No fry survival was recorded at a concentration of 10. 0 g/L for either stage of development. The mean 24 h LC 50 values for the yolk <b>sac</b> and swim-up <b>fry</b> were 0. 61 and 0. 70 g/L NaCl respectively. Sodium chloride may be used as prophylactic treatment in early stages of C. gariepinus but could be toxic at longer exposure times.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the efficacy of two procedures i. e. feeding and immersion followed by feeding, for masculinizing Blue Hap. Two experiments (experiments I and II) were conducted. In experiment I, feeding hormonal treatment was applied on post-yolk <b>sac</b> stage <b>fry</b> (10 days after fertilization at 27 ºC). Dosages of 30 mg (group A) and 60 mg (group B) of 17 α-methyltestosterone per kg of food were used during 60 -day periods (40 fry per treatment). The control group i. e. group C, received no hormone. In experiment II, one day post hatching larvae were exposed to an immersion treatment in 17 α-methyltestosterone at 1000 µg/l up to 2 h (16 larvae per treatment). Later, at the first day of post-yolk sac stage, the treatment was followed by oral procedure which was divided in 2 groups: group D and group E. In group D, 30 mg 17 α-Methyltestosterone per kg of food was used during a 60 -day period. In group E, fry received 60 mg of hormone per kg of food during the same period. The control group i. e. group F, did not receive any hormone. Change in sex proportion within each experiment as well as between experiments was analyzed by chi-square test (p< 0. 05). In experiment I, 60 mg feeding treatment significantly (p< 0. 05) increased the proportion of the males (85. 7 %) in comparison to the control group (46. 67 %). Lower male proportion (60 %), but still significant (p< 0. 05), was evaluated in 30 mg feeding treatment. In experiment II, in both groups (D and E), although sex ratio was different from the theoretical 1 : 1 sex ratio, fish skewed toward sterility rather than masculinization because of high hormonal dozes. In conclusion, this study confirms that it is possible to achieve high rates of hormonal masculinization in Blue hap...|$|R
40|$|Despite a {{long history}} of rearing Atlantic salmon in {{hatcheries}} in Norway, knowledge of molecular and physiological aspects of juvenile development is still limited. To facilitate introduction of alternative feed ingredients and feed additives during early phases, increased knowledge regarding the ontogeny of the digestive apparatus in salmon is needed. In this study, we characterized the development of the gastrointestinal tract and accessory digestive organs for five months following hatch by using histological, biochemical and molecular methods. Furthermore, the effects of a diet containing 16. 7 % soybean meal (SBM) introduced at start-feeding were investigated, as compared to a fishmeal based control diet. Salmon yolk <b>sac</b> alevins and <b>fry</b> were sampled at 18 time points from hatch until 144 days post hatch (dph). Histomorphological development was investigated at 7, 27, 46, 54 and 144 dph. Ontogenetic expression patterns of genes encoding key digestive enzymes, nutrient transporters, gastrointestinal peptide hormones and T-cell markers were analyzed from 13 time points by qPCR. At 7 dph, the digestive system of Atlantic salmon alevins was morphologically distinct with an early stomach, liver, pancreas, anterior and posterior intestine. About one week before the yolk sac was internalized and exogenous feeding was started, gastric glands and developing pyloric caeca were observed, which coincided with an increase in gene expression of gastric and pancreatic enzymes and nutrient transporters. Thus, the observed organs seemed ready to digest external feed well before the yolk sac was absorbed into the abdominal cavity. In contrast to post-smolt Atlantic salmon, inclusion of SBM did not induce intestinal inflammation in the juveniles. This indicates that SBM can be used in compound feeds for salmon fry from start-feeding to at least 144 dph and/or 4 - 5 g body weight...|$|R

For FY 2008, three objectives were 1) to repeat the 2006 - 2007 field effort to collect empirical data on TDG from the Ives Island and Multnomah Falls study sites; 2) to repeat the static laboratory toxicity tests on hatchery chum salmon fry to verify 2007 results and to expose wild chum salmon fry to incremental increases in TDG, above those of the static test, until external symptoms of gas bubble disease were clearly present; and 3) to assess physiological responses to TDG levels in wild chum salmon <b>sac</b> <b>fry</b> incubating below Bonneville Dam during spill operations. This report summarizes the tasks conducted and results obtained in pursuit of the three objectives. Chapter 1 discusses the field monitoring, Chapter 2 reports the findings of the laboratory toxicity tests, and Chapter 3 describes the field-sampling task. Each chapter contains an objective-specific introduction, description of the study site and methods, results of research, and discussion of findings. Literature cited throughout this report is listed in Chapter 4.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Acute {{toxicity}} bioassays (96 -hr TL₅₀) {{were employed}} to determine the tolerance of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to inorganic chloramines at the alevin (yolk <b>sac</b> <b>fry),</b> yolk absorption, and early juvenile life stages. Any influence of changes in temperature, pH, and total alkalinity on the tolerance of juvenile coho for chloramines was also investigated. The least tolerant stage occurred shortly after yolk absorption. No change in juvenile coho was found when temperature was increased from 10. 8 to 15. 0 C. Increasing alkalinity from 135 to 320 mg/l was not shown to affect tolerance of the juvenile stage. Increasing pH from 7. 0 to 7. 5 apparently did not change tolerance at this stage, but an increase from 7. 5 to 8. 1 resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} tolerance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract approved: Developing {{steelhead trout}} eggs and <b>sac</b> <b>fry</b> were {{examined}} for wet, dry and lipid weights and for fatty acid composition {{over the period}} from fertilization until {{the disappearance of the}} yolk sac, 69 days after fertilization. The yolk sac and embryo or fry were separated shortly before hatching, and the above determinations were made on each compartment for succeeding samples. Losses in the dry and lipid weights of the whole system were not apparent until the time of hatching. Yolk constituents decreased uniformly after hatching, while the embryo or fry gain in wet, dry and lipid weights ceased, 54 days after fertilization. After 54 days, consumption of lipid by the fry resulted in no net deposition of lipid in the fry, implying that the amount of lipid transported out of the yolk after this time was used for production of energy...|$|E
40|$|Background Atlantic salmon {{have been}} subject to {{domestication}} for approximately ten generations, beginning in the early 1970 s. This process of artificial selection will have created various genetic differences between wild and farmed stocks. Each year, hundreds of thousands of farmed fish escape into the wild. These escapees may interbreed with wild conspecifics raising concerns for both the fish-farming industry and fisheries managers. Thus, {{a better understanding of the}} interactions between domesticated and wild salmon is essential to the continued sustainability of the aquaculture industry and to the maintenance of healthy wild stocks. Results We compared the transcriptomes of a wild Norwegian Atlantic salmon population (Figgjo) and a Norwegian farmed strain (Mowi) at two life stages: yolk <b>sac</b> <b>fry</b> and post first-feeding fry. The analysis employed 44 k oligo-microarrays to analyse gene expression of 36 farmed, wild and hybrid (farmed dam x wild sire) individuals reared under identical hatchery conditions. Although some of the transcriptional differences detected overlapped between sampling points, our results highlighted the importance of studying various life stages. Compared to the wild population, the Mowi strain displayed up-regulation in mRNA translation-related and down regulation in nervous and immune system -related pathways in the <b>sac</b> <b>fry,</b> whereas up-regulation of digestive and endocrine activities, carbohydrate, energy, amino acid and lipid metabolism and down-regulation of environmental information processing and immune system pathways were evident in the feeding fry. Differentially regulated pathways that were common among life stages generally belonged to environmental information processing and immune system functional groups. In addition, we found indications of strong maternal effects, reinforcing the importance of including reciprocal hybrids in the analysis. Conclusions In agreement with previous studies we showed that domestication has caused changes in the transcriptome of wild Atlantic salmon and that many of the affected pathways are life-stage specific We highlighted the importance of reciprocal hybrids to the deconvolution of maternal/paternal effects and our data support the view that the genetic architecture of the strains studied highly influences the genes differentially expressed between wild and domesticated fish...|$|E
40|$|A closed, {{stirring}} respirometer {{was designed}} to agitate small egg mass samples of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus while measuring oxygen consumption by the eggs. Egg mass samples {{ranging in size from}} 15 to 46 g were placed on a screen platform above a magnetic stir bar in the respirometer; the degree of agitation was controlled with a magnetic stir plate. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and temperature were measured with a luminescent DO sensor and meter. The respirometer was used to determine routine metabolic rate and limiting oxygen concentration (the presumed hypometabolic transition zone) on egg mass samples from 10 different spawns at 0 to 5 d postfertilization. Routine metabolic rate increased from 4. 8 ± 1. 3 (0 d postfertilization) to 174. 0 ± 7. 8 mg O 2 ·kg- 1 ·h- 1 (5 d postfertilization). The limiting oxygen concentration increased similarly up to 87. 0 % ± 2. 7 % (maximum individual value = 95. 9 %) air saturation by 5 d postfertilization. The respirometer described could not be used for <b>sac</b> <b>fry,</b> but it proved effective with clumped channel catfish eggs. Preliminary channel catfish hatchery management recommendations are to maintain DO concentrations in hatchery troughs at air saturation at least during the last day of egg development...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{research conducted}} by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in FY 2007 for the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District, to characterize the effects of total dissolved gas (TDG) on the incubating fry of chum salmon (Onchorhynchus keta) in the lower Columbia River. The tasks conducted and results obtained in pursuit of three objectives are summarized: * to conduct a field monitoring program at the Ives Island and Multnomah Falls study sites, collecting empirical data on TDG to obtain a more thorough understanding of TDG levels during different river stage scenarios (i. e., high-water year versus low-water year) * to conduct laboratory toxicity tests on hatchery chum salmon fry at gas levels likely to occur downstream from Bonneville Dam * to sample chum salmon <b>sac</b> <b>fry</b> during Bonneville Dam spill operations {{to determine if there}} is a physiological response to TDG levels. Chapter 1 discusses the field monitoring, Chapter 2 reports the findings of the laboratory toxicity tests, and Chapter 3 describes the field-sampling task.

40|$|All {{water for}} the Ennis NFH is {{supplied}} from Blaine Spring which surfaces about 3 mile north of the hatchery. The water flows about 600 feet before it is collected into pipelines to the hatchery. Buildings and a hypalon cover have been placed over both arms of the spring. This water at the ground source is low in oxygen (6. 3 ppm, 71 % saturation) and supersaturated (130 %) with nitrogen gas. The water must be treated to make it suitable for fish production. Historically the untreated water, after flowing through about 1000 feet of pipe and entering tanks and raceways at the hatchery, contained about 7. 5 ppm oxygen (85 % saturation) and 110 % to 115 % nitrogen gas. Total gas averaged about 108 % saturation. Under the above conditions, the fish were severely stressed with gas bubble disease {{as evidenced by the}} presence of gas bubbles in blood vessels, under the skin, in the gills and behind the eyeballs. Mortality of <b>sac</b> <b>fry</b> and swim up fry was excessive. Prior to installation of packed columns, post spawning mortality was as much as 50 % among females and 50 % to 100 % of males. Stress from the gas bubble disease may have weakened the fish so that they were overcome by infection with bacteria an...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the tolerance of larval fish in the families Characidae, Cyprinidae, and Belontiidae to therapeutic doses of sodium chloride and formalin. Four species of fish were included in this study: zebra danio Brachydanio rerio (also known as Danio rerio), black tetra Gymnocorymbus ternetzi, Buenos Aires tetra Hemigrammus caudovittatus, and blue gourami (also known as threespot gourami) Trichogaster trichopterus. Representative species from each family for both yolk <b>sac</b> <b>fry</b> (2 – 3 d old) and free-swimming fry (5 – 7 d old) were tested. The treatments consisted of 1 or 3 g/L sodium chloride or 12. 5 or 25 mg/L formalin. Mortalities at 24 and 48 h were compared. Although 12. 5 – 25 mg/L of formalin appears to be safe for very young zebra danio fry, therapeutic doses of salt are not recommended. Yolk sac and free-swimming fry of the blue gourami are tolerant of therapeutic doses of salt (1 – 3 g/L) but very sensitive to formalin. Because there are significant differences in the tolerance of black tetras and albino Buenos Aires tetras to salt and formalin, neither treatment is recommended for use with the yolk sac and free-swimming fry of these species. Many species of freshwater ornamental fish are cultured in the United States, primarily in Florida...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the use of {{artificial}} and semi-artificial spawning substrates in the current breeding of common carp (Cyprinus carpio, L.) a literature review of this species was processed in relation to reproduction, {{as well as of the}} spawning methods (natural, semi-artificial, artificial). Results are drawn from the experimental part (2 spawns: a semi-artificial spawn in the institution for experiments at the Fishery School in Vodňany and an artificial spawn in the fish hatchery at the Research Institute of Fish Culture and Hydrobiology in Vodňany). In both spawns, hormonal stimulation of brood stock was carried out. In the artificial spawning the amount of obtained sex products of individual breeds was assessed. At the same time, a questionnaire survey was conducted at 11 fish-breeding companies engaged in their own production of yolk <b>sac</b> <b>fry.</b> The responses obtained from the survey and findings from the experimental part of spawnings were compared with bibliographic sources which the following conclusions were reached from. It was confirmed that at present a massive carp fingerling production from artificial spawn ensuring optimized conditions dominates over the Dubravius method of semi-artificial spawning which is used only rarely. The production of mirror carp is currently higher than the production of scaly carp. Among the bred mirror breeds the Hungarian mirror carp (M 2) prevails, nonetheless it depends on the individual fishery company which form of carp they choose to satisfy the market demand...|$|E
