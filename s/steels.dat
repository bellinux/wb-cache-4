5|$|Most {{high-strength}} steel alloys (for example, 41xx <b>steels)</b> contain 0.25% to 8% molybdenum. Even in these small portions, more than 43,000 tonnes of molybdenum are used {{each year in}} stainless <b>steels,</b> tool <b>steels,</b> cast irons, and high-temperature superalloys.|$|E
5|$|Stainless <b>steels</b> {{contain a}} minimum of 11% chromium, often {{combined}} with nickel, to resist corrosion. Some stainless <b>steels,</b> such as the ferritic stainless <b>steels</b> are magnetic, while others, such as the austenitic, are nonmagnetic. Corrosion-resistant <b>steels</b> are abbreviated as CRES.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum is also {{valued in}} steel alloys for its high {{corrosion}} resistance and weldability. Molybdenum contributes corrosion resistance to type-300 stainless <b>steels</b> (specifically type-316) and especially {{so in the}} so-called superaustenitic stainless <b>steels</b> (such as alloy AL-6XN, 254SMO or 1925hMo). Molybdenum increases lattice strain, thus increasing the energy required to dissolve iron atoms from the surface. Molybdenum {{is also used to}} enhance the corrosion resistance of ferritic (for example grade 444) and martensitic (for example 1.4122 and 1.4418) stainless <b>steels.</b>|$|E

5|$|Broaching {{works best}} on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, and plastic. However, {{it still has}} a good {{machinability}} rating on mild <b>steels</b> and free machining <b>steels.</b> When broaching, the machinability rating {{is closely related to}} the hardness of the material. For <b>steels</b> the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|E
5|$|Carbon <b>Steels</b> {{are often}} galvanized, through hot-dip or {{electroplating}} in zinc for protection against rust.|$|E
5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy <b>steels</b> contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed <b>steels,</b> also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy <b>steels,</b> containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E

5|$|Niobium is an {{effective}} microalloying element for steel, within which it forms niobium carbide and niobium nitride. These compounds improve the grain refining, and retard recrystallization and precipitation hardening. These effects in turn increase the toughness, strength, formability, and weldability. Within microalloyed stainless <b>steels,</b> the niobium content is a small (less than 0.1%) but important addition to {{high strength low alloy}} <b>steels</b> that are widely used structurally in modern automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Some {{more modern}} <b>steels</b> include tool <b>steels,</b> which are alloyed with {{large amounts of}} {{tungsten}} and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering <b>steels</b> such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. Maraging steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very strong but still malleable steel.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, machinability, heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly {{dependent on the}} temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time. The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool <b>steels,</b> because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy <b>steels.</b>|$|E
5|$|About 86% of {{molybdenum}} produced {{is used in}} metallurgy, {{with the}} rest used in chemical applications. The estimated global use is structural steel 35%, stainless steel 25%, chemicals 14%, tool & high-speed <b>steels</b> 9%, cast iron 6%, molybdenum elemental metal 6%, and superalloys 5%.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From that time on, vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool <b>steels</b> (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool <b>steels,</b> a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E

5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless <b>steels</b> and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic <b>steels</b> and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
5|$|In its raw form, {{tungsten}} {{is a hard}} {{steel-grey metal}} that is often brittle and hard to work. If made very pure, tungsten retains its hardness (which exceeds that of many <b>steels),</b> and becomes malleable enough {{that it can be}} worked easily. It is worked by forging, drawing, or extruding. Tungsten objects are also commonly formed by sintering.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{consists of}} the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape. Moulds can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made from tool <b>steels,</b> but stainless <b>steels</b> and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high volume production or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior mechanical properties and {{are more prone to}} wear, damage, and deformation during the injection and clamping cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced. Many steel moulds are designed to process well over a million parts during their lifetime and can cost {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to fabricate.|$|E
