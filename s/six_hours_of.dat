5|$|Initially, Hurricane Iris was {{forecast}} {{to remain}} a tropical cyclone while crossing Central America and to re-intensify in the eastern Pacific Ocean; had it done so, it would have retained the name Iris. Instead, the hurricane rapidly weakened after moving into the mountainous terrain of Guatemala, and within <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> landfall the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm. Late on October9, within sixteen hours of landfall, the circulation dissipated over extreme southeastern Mexico. As the remnants approached the Pacific Ocean, a new area of convection developed south of the original circulation of Iris. It gradually organized while continuing westward, developing into Tropical Storm Manuel; the new storm ultimately lasted until October18 before succumbing to cooler waters and wind shear.|$|E

5|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bradman added only eight before falling for 138 when he leg glanced an inswinger from Bedser to Hutton at short fine leg. Johnson and Tallon came and went, failing to pass 21. The scoring was slow during this passage of play—Young {{delivered}} 11 consecutive maiden overs. Lindwall {{came out to}} bat at 365/7 and he added 107 runs with Hassett for the eighth wicket. Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> batting. Both fell in quick succession, but Australia's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes before Bedser ended the innings on 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead. Yardley placed {{the majority of the}} bowling load on his spinners, with Young (1/79) and Laker (4/138) bowling 60 and 55 overs respectively. Bedser bowled 44.2 overs, taking 3/113.|$|E
5|$|With a mid-level {{ridge to}} its northwest, the {{subtropical}} depression was anticipated to parallel the coastline of the Gulf Coast of the United States. As a result, it was forecast to attain winds of 45mph (75km/h) and move ashore along southern Mississippi. The circulation became better defined as convection modestly {{increased over the}} center, and within <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> its development the system transitioned into a tropical depression. The cyclone continued tracking northwestward, making landfall around 0000UTC on September22 near Fort Walton Beach, Florida, with winds of 35mph (55km/h). The cloud pattern deteriorated as it tracked inland, and 3hours after it moved ashore the National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the depression. As the depression tracked into Alabama, it became increasingly disorganized, and the system dissipated as a tropical cyclone early on September 22. Its remnant surface low continued west-northwest before dissipating near the Louisiana/Texas border early on September23.|$|E
5|$|Within <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> its {{classification}} as Tropical Low 13U, {{the system}} developed a central dense overcast, {{which is an}} organized area of convection around the center. At 18:00UTC on February16, the BoM upgraded the low to a Category1 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, naming it Lam. At that time, the BoM anticipated the cyclone would intensify to peak 10 minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) within 72 hours, which proved very accurate. Also at 18:00UTC on February16, the JTWC began classifying the system as Tropical Cyclone 12P. Early on February17, an eye feature began forming within the convection. That day, Lam moved quicker to the west-northwest and slowed its rate of strengthening as it approached the Wessel Islands. Early on February18, the eye became better defined, moving over Cape Wessel. At 06:00UTC that day, the BoM upgraded Lam to a Category3 Severe Tropical Cyclone with 10 minute winds of 120km/h (75mph), equivalent to a minimal hurricane.|$|E

5|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bradman resumed on 130, before {{progressing}} to 132 and {{becoming the first}} player to pass 1,000 runs for the English season. His innings was soon terminated at 138 when he leg glanced an inswinger from Bedser to Hutton at short fine leg. Bradman had batted for 290 minutes and Johnson replaced him with Australia at 305/5. Johnson made 21 before being bowled by Laker, and Tallon took 39 minutes to compile 10 before hitting a return catch to the left arm orthodox spin of Young. The scoring was slow during this passage of play—Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26-over spell conceded only 14 runs. Lindwall came out to bat at 365/7 without a runner and he added 107 runs with Hassett for the eighth wicket. Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> batting, striking 20 fours and a six. The partnership was terminated when Bedser struck Hassett's off stump. Lindwall was caught by Evans down the leg side four runs later, but Australia's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes before Bedser trapped Toshack lbw to end the innings on 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead. Australia had batted for 216.2 overs, the longest innings in terms of overs and the highest total in the series. Yardley placed the majority of the bowling load on his spinners, with Young (1/79) and Laker (4/138) bowling 60 and 55 overs respectively. Bedser bowled 44.2 overs, taking 3/113.|$|E
