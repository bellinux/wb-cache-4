40|$|Effect of {{different}} concentrations of Paclobutrazol and dipping period on rooting of <b>softwood</b> <b>cutting</b> of Guava was studied at Ornamental Nursery, NWFP Agricultural University, Peshawar. Fresh softwood cuttings of Guava having 3 - 4 leaves were dipped in 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 ppm solution of Paclobutrazol for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h and were planted in plastic tubes {{and covered with}} polythene sheet for maintaining humidity. In various Paclobutrazol concentration 60 ppm resulted in maximum cutting success (73. 3 %), rooting (69. 5 %), shoot length (24. 3 cm), number of branches (4. 3), number of roots (87. 1) and root volume per plant (1. 64 cm 3). In various dipping period five hours dipping resulted in maximum cutting success (34. 9 %), rooting (30. 1 %), shoot length (10. 6 cm) and number of roots (47. 2) while four hours dipping resulted in maximum number of branches (2. 6) and root volume per plant (1. 05 cm 3). In interaction maximum cutting success (81. 7 %), shoot length (28. 8 cm) and number of branches (5. 3) was observed in 60 ppm Paclobutrazol concentration and 2 h dipping. 60 ppm Paclobutrazol concentration and 3 h dipping period gave maximum rooting (80 %), number of roots (102. 7) and root volume per plant (1. 76 cm 3) ...|$|E

This {{study was conducted in}} Agropark, University Malaysia Kelantan. By using the completely randomized block design, cuttings were taken in areas around University Malaysia Kelantan and planted in the medium containing soil (60 %), compost (20 %) and sand (20 %) after dipping in indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) for five minutes. Five different parameters were studied for number of leaves; branches and branch length were measured per week while number of root and root length were measured for four weeks interval. It was obvious that the root initiation of Chromolaena odorata is significantly (P < 0. 05) influenced by the interactive effect of cutting age and IBA concentration. Maximum number of leaves (19. 13), branches (4. 00), branch length (7. 43), number of root (45. 11), and root length (12. 87) was obtained in cuttings treated with 2000 ppm while minimum number of leaves (12. 6), branches (2. 47), branch length (5. 93), number of root (24. 33), and root length (6. 60), was recorded in control treatment. Meanwhile, the cuttings taken from softwood had higher number of leaves (19. 30), branches (3. 70), branch length (7. 25), number of root (45. 25), and root length (12. 40) than those taken from semi-hardwood and hardwood. <b>Softwood</b> <b>cutting</b> responded more positively to IBA and stimulated leaf and root formation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of a range of Indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) concentrations (250, 500 and 750 mg l- 1) alone and in combination with three strains of Agrobacterium rubi (A 1, A 16 and A 18) on the rooting capacity of wild sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) softwood and semi-hardwood cuttings. The bacterial strains {{used in the present study}} were isolated from the foliage of pome fruits (from apple and pear orchards) growing in the eastern Anatolia region of Turkey. No rooting was observed on the cuttings of wild sour cherry with control treatment (no IBA or bacterial treatment) in both types of cuttings, whereas different rooting percentages were observed on the cuttings treated with IBA and bacteria. The highest rooting percentages were 65 % for softwood and 70 % for semi-hardwood cuttings when they were treated with 250 mg l- 1 IBA + A 16 treatments. In <b>softwood</b> <b>cutting</b> treatments, the bacteria strains A 16 (43. 8 %) and A 1 (42. 5 %) were found to be more effective than the strain A 18 (18. 8 %) and the control (13. 1 %). Among the hormone doses, the best rooting percentage was found at the treatment of 250 mg l- 1 IBA (39. 4 %). In semi-hardwood cuttings the highest rooting percentage among the bacterial strains and hormone doses was obtained with the treatments of A 16 (49. 4 %) and 750 mg l- 1 IBA (46. 9 %). The results indicate that the combination of IBA + bacteria is highly effective in increasing rooting capacity when compared to the control, or bacteria and IBA treatments alone...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Three spineless phenotypes of Acacia wrightii G. Bentham ex A. Gray were identified with aesthetic landscape potential. Experiments in seed, cutting, grafting, and tissue culture propagation were undertaken to perpetuate this desired spineless phenotype. Germination percentages for mechanically scarified seeds ranged from 33 % to 94 %, however yield of spineless seedlings was low (0 to 34 %). Sulfuric acid scarification for 10, 20, 30, or 60 minutes hastened and unified germination compared to non-treated seeds by seven to eight days. Vegetative propagation was successful for softwood cuttings. Rooting measures increased with auxin concentration from 0 to 15000 mg? L??, with maximum rooting percentage, root number, and root length per <b>softwood</b> <b>cutting</b> of 70 %, 9. 2 roots, and 12. 4 cm, respectively, at 15000 mg? L?? auxin eight weeks after treatment. Rooting was not successful for semi-hardwood and hardwood cuttings. Whip-and-tongue and T-bud grafting were not successful with the treatments used, likely due to accumulation of phenolic compounds and inexperience in these techniques. Tissue culture of shoots from in vitro germinated seedlings indicated that shoot proliferation was greater in Murishige and Skoog (MS) medium with 15 to 20 [u]M zeatin in the first experiment. Shoot proliferation was greater on Woody Plant Medium with 20 [u]M benzyladenine in the second experiment. A weeping phenotype of Ulmus parvifolia Jacq. was identified with aesthetic landscape value. Cuttings at different growth stages using varied concentrations of a rooting hormone were compared to determine the most efficient method to perpetuate this desired phenotype. Softwood cuttings had a higher rooting percentage (84 %), more roots regenerated per cutting (18) and longer total root lengths (50 cm) than either semi-hardwood or hardwood cuttings using 10000 mg?L?? auxin. Semi-hardwood cuttings had greater height (153. 4 cm) and trunk diameter (12. 5 mm) at end of production in 6. 3 L containers than softwood and hardwood cuttings, however, the survival rates were lower for semi-hardwood cuttings (29 %) than for softwood cuttings (86 %).
