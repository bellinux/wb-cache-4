5|$|The Heart of a Woman, {{published}} in 1981, {{is the fourth}} installment of Maya Angelou's series of seven autobiographies. The success of her previous autobiographies and the publication of three volumes of poetry had brought Angelou {{a considerable amount of}} fame by 1981. And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise, her third volume of poetry, was {{published in}} 1978 and reinforced Angelou's success as a writer. Her first volume of poetry, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.|$|E

I mean, I <b>still,</b> <b>I</b> {{do the same things}} that I did before … I think about the same things, so … I'm the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous.|$|E
5|$|And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise {{is author}} Maya Angelou's third volume of poetry, {{published}} by Random House in 1978. It was published {{during one of}} the most productive periods in Angelou's career; she had written three autobiographies and published two other volumes of poetry up to that point. Angelou considered herself a poet and a playwright, but was best known for her seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, although her poetry has also been successful. She began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Although her poetry collections have been best-sellers, they have not received serious critical attention.|$|E

Poor mamma! <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E

To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E
25|$|On February 13, 1996, Shakur {{released}} his fourth solo album, All Eyez on Me. This double album {{was the first}} and second of his three-album commitment to Death Row Records. It sold more than nine million copies. The record was a general departure from the introspective subject matter of Me Against the World, being more oriented toward a thug and gangsta mentality. Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. Dr. Dre left his post as in-house producer to form his own label, Aftermath. Shakur continued to produce hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on his posthumous albums <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise, Until the End of Time, Better Dayz, Loyal to the Game and Pac's Life. He also began the process of recording an album, One Nation, with the New York-based Boot Camp Clik and their label Duck Down Records.|$|E
500|$|And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise {{is made up}} of 32 short poems, {{divided into}} three parts. The poems' themes focus on a hopeful {{determination}} to rise above difficulty and discouragement, and on many of the same topics as Angelou's autobiographies and previous volumes of poetry. Two of her most well-known and popular poems, [...] "Phenomenal Woman" [...] and [...] "Still I Rise", are found in this volume. She speaks for her race and gender in many of the poems, and again emphasizes the strength and resiliency of her community. Like her previous volumes of poetry, the reviews of And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise were mixed.|$|E

500|$|And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise {{consists}} of 32 poems, {{divided into three}} parts. [...] The first part, entitled [...] "Touch Me, Life, Not Softly", has been called [...] "joyful" [...] and affirms the poet's strength as a woman and as a lover. Part Two, [...] "Traveling", focus on the hardships, such as drug addiction, child abuse, inner-city life, and conditions in the Old South, that the author and others have experienced. Part Three, [...] "And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise", which gets {{its name from the}} volume's title poem, reiterates the themes in Part One and emphasizes the strength she finds in herself and in her community. [...] The volume is dedicated to Jessica Mitford, Gerard W. Purcell, and Jay Allen, whom Angelou calls [...] "a few of the Good Guys".|$|E
500|$|Two of {{the poems}} in And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise, [...] "Phenomenal Woman" [...] and [...] "Just For a Time", {{appeared}} in Cosmopolitan in 1978. [...] In 1994, the title poem, [...] "Still I Rise", {{was part of an}} advertising campaign for the 50th anniversary of the United Negro College Fund.|$|E
500|$|Critic Robert B. Stepto {{states that}} the poem [...] "One More Round", in And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise is heavily {{influenced}} by the work and protest songs of the past. The even-number stanzas in the eight-stanza poem create a refrain like those found in many work songs and are variations of many protest poems. Stepto is impressed with Angelou's {{creation of a new}} art form out of work and protest forms, but does not feel that she develops it enough. He places Angelou's work in the tradition of other Black poets, and compares the poems in And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise to the works of Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Sterling Brown. Stepto also praises Angelou for borrowing [...] "various folk rhythms and forms and thereby buttresses her poems by evoking aspects of a culture's written and unwritten heritage". Despite Angelou's strong criticism of racism, she also asserted in all her writings what Hagen calls a recurring theme, that [...] "we are more alike than unalike".|$|E

I spent my childhood in New York, riding on subways and buses. And you know what you learn if you're a New Yorker? The world doesn't owe you a damn thing." ...|$|R
500|$|Angelou began, {{early in}} her writing career, {{alternating}} the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. By the time And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise was published in 1978, she had published three autobiographies, eventually going on to publish seven. In 1993, she read her poem [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] at President Bill Clinton's inauguration. The following year, her publisher, Random House, placed the poems in And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise in her first collection of poetry, The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou. Also in the 1994 collection were her two previous collections, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971) and Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well, along with her two volumes published afterwards, Shaker, Why Don't You Sing? (1983) and I Shall Not Be Moved (1990). Angelou's publisher placed four poems in a smaller volume, entitled Phenomenal Woman, in 1995.|$|E
500|$|And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise is Maya Angelou's third {{volume of}} poetry. She studied and began writing poetry {{at a young}} age. [...] After her rape {{at the age of}} eight, as recounted in her first {{autobiography}} I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), she dealt with her trauma by memorizing and reciting great works of literature, including poetry, which helped bring her out of her self-imposed muteness.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{consider}} Angelou's autobiographies to be {{more important}} than her poetry, including William Sylvester, who states that although Angelou's books have been best-sellers, her poetry has not been perceived as seriously as her prose. Despite her popular and critical acclaim garnered by her autobiographies, her poetry has been understudied, even after her recitation of [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] in 1993. Like many reviewers of Angelou's poetry, Ellen Lippmann in her review of And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise in School Library Journal finds Angelou's prose stronger than her poetry, but found her strength more apparent in the poems in this volume than in Caged Bird. In his negative review of And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise, Stepto expresses disbelief that Angelou's poems would be produced by a major publishing house while poetry written by other lesser-known talents could not. He explains her popularity as a poet with her autobiographies, which he calls [...] "marvelous" [...] and the real reason for her success as a poet. He states that her poetry serves as explanatory texts for her prose works, which he calls [...] "more adeptly rendered self-portraits".|$|E

500|$|Opeth {{returned}} to Sweden after touring {{in support of}} Blackwater Park, and began writing for the next album. At first, Åkerfeldt had trouble putting together new material: [...] "I wanted to write something heavier than we'd ever done, <b>still</b> <b>I</b> had all these great mellow parts and arrangements which I didn't {{want to go to}} waste." [...] Jonas Renkse of Katatonia, a long-time friend of Åkerfeldt, suggested writing music for two separate albums—one heavy and one soft.|$|E
500|$|Stepto {{considers}} the poems in And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise as slight and [...] "thin stuff", and expresses his disbelief that Angelou's poems would {{be produced by}} a major publishing house while poetry written by other lesser-known talents could not. He is {{able to see the}} possibilities of what he considered good poetry in her writing, and states that her best poems borrow [...] "various folk rhythms and forms and thereby buttresses her poems by evoking aspects of a culture's written and unwritten heritage". [...] He places Angelou's work in the tradition of other Black poets, and compares the poems in And <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> Rise to the works of Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Sterling Brown. For example, many of Angelou's poems remind Stepto of Brown's poems. [...] "Still I Rise" [...] reminds Stepto of Brown's most famous poem, [...] "Strong Men". Stepto explains Angelou's success and popularity as a poet with her autobiographies, which he calls [...] "marvelous" [...] and the real reason for her success as a poet. He states that her poetry serves as explanatory texts for her prose works, which he calls [...] "more adeptly rendered self-portraits".|$|E
500|$|After the game, Brandon Graham, {{who played}} with Robinson at Michigan in 2009 and also played with Michael Vick on the Philadelphia Eagles told reporters that Robinson is even quicker than Vick: [...] "Both of them are pretty fast, I just think Vick's older; he's not really that fast like how Shoelace is. I think Shoelace is more quick than Vick, but Vick, he gets away. He's pretty fast <b>still.</b> <b>I</b> think Shoelace might have got him by a couple steps." ...|$|E
