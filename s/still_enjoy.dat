In Malaysia, the right to vote is entrenched in Article 119 of the Federal Constitution, but suffrage is similarly denied to those serving prison terms. In Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia (2009), it was held that while detainees under the Internal Security Act 1960– who have not been convicted of any crime– <b>still</b> <b>enjoy</b> the right to vote in national elections, that right may only be exercised only in the constituencies they are registered in, and does not extend to allowing them to vote while incarcerated elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Ciphertexts {{produced}} by a classical cipher (and some modern ciphers) will reveal statistical information about the plaintext, and that information can often be used to break the cipher. After the discovery of frequency analysis, perhaps by the Arab mathematician and polymath Al-Kindi (also known as Alkindus) in the 9th century, nearly all such ciphers could be broken by an informed attacker. Such classical ciphers <b>still</b> <b>enjoy</b> popularity today, though mostly as puzzles (see cryptogram). Al-Kindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu'amma (Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages), which described the first known use of frequency analysis cryptanalysis techniques.|$|E
25|$|On {{the flight}} home, Musk {{realized}} that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed. According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson, Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. By applying vertical integration, producing around 85% of launch hardware in-house, and the modular approach from software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price {{by a factor of}} ten and <b>still</b> <b>enjoy</b> a 70 percent gross margin. SpaceX started with the smallest useful orbital rocket, instead of building a more complex and riskier launch vehicle, which could have failed and bankrupted the company.|$|E
25|$|Among {{other things}} in the recent update, the band said they were {{extremely}} surprised on how well their last album, Awake?, did in the market considering it had no tour support by them {{and that it was}} thrown onto Ferret's label in the 11th hour. Zao said the best thing to come out of it is that they learned a lot of the last release and it showed them that fans <b>still</b> <b>enjoy</b> their music and this inspired and motivated them to continue making music. According to social media reports, on July 11, 2014, Zao went into the studio, after a five-year unofficial hiatus and working on side projects like Lonely Ghost Parade and Young Fox, is currently, tracking and recording their 11th album.

25|$|Protected {{areas in}} {{developing}} countries, where probably {{as many as}} 70–80 percent of the species of the world live, <b>still</b> <b>enjoy</b> very little effective management and protection. Some countries, such as Mexico, have non-profit civil organizations and landowners dedicated to protecting vast private property, {{such is the case}} of Hacienda Chichen's Maya Jungle Reserve and Bird Refuge in Chichen Itza, Yucatán. The Adopt A Ranger Foundation has calculated that worldwide about 140,000 rangers are needed for the protected areas in developing and transition countries. There are no data on how many rangers are employed at the moment, but probably less than half the protected areas in developing and transition countries have any rangers at all and those that have them are at least 50% short This means {{that there would be a}} worldwide ranger deficit of 105,000 rangers in the developing and transition countries.|$|E
25|$|The 86 riders {{remaining}} in the race took off from the Al Thakhira harbour. It would be another day across the peninsula {{under the influence of}} strong winds. Despite several attempts, the pack remained bunched all the way to Al Zubara, north-west of Qatar. The first hour had an avarege speed of 48 kilometres per hour. The first bonus sprint was won by Kirsten Wild As the pack headed up north and the wind started blowing sideways, several riders failed {{to keep up with the}} pace. While a crash occurred in the peloton, a group of 18 ladies pulled away including race leader Chloe Hosking, Ellen van Dijk, Wild, Gracie Elvin, and Trixi Worrack. The front group enjoyed a 40” lead at km 83 on a group of 22 including Cromwell, Gilmour and Bronzini. With 25 kilometres to go, as the riders entered the final circuit, the first two groups bunched up together again. 8 riders gave it a go but where rapidly caught before reaching Madinat Al Shamal for the second bonus sprint won by Lisa Brennauer ahead of Chantal Blaak, who had both broken away just before crossing the line. Wild powered to third spot ahead of the pack, 5” adrift. With 10 kilometres to go, Brennauer and Blaak could <b>still</b> <b>enjoy</b> a 10” lead. Both were first caught by Fahlin and Cantele and then by the whole golden jersey group with 5 kilometres to go. Just under 40 riders moved closer to the finish line. With under 3 kilometres to go, race leader Hosking suffered a puncture. Despite being eventually given the winner’s time, she could no longer hope for stage victory and extra bonus seconds. Well helped out by her Team Argos-Shimano teammates, Wild powered to a second consecutive stage win, beating Ellen van Dijk and Giorgia Bronzini.|$|E

500|$|... "Elmo's World" [...] stopped {{production}} in 2009, when {{the producers of}} Sesame Street began taking steps to increase the age of their viewers and to increase the show's ratings, and because the show's curriculum was not designed for a younger audience. They were successful; {{by the end of}} the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, 3-year-old viewers had increased by 41 percent, 4-year-olds by 4 percent, and 5-year-olds by 21 percent. In 2012, [...] "Elmo's World" [...] was replaced by [...] "Elmo the Musical"; even though it was designed for older viewers, the producers hoped that younger children would <b>still</b> <b>enjoy</b> it.

Parker commented that, while the episode did deal with some issues they had with the show, they particularly enjoyed creating [...] "You're Getting Old", and that despite not knowing what upcoming episodes would be about, they would figure it out upon resuming production in August 2011.

500|$|Among other composers {{whose work}} carries the {{influence}} of Mahler, Mitchell lists America's Aaron Copland, the German song and stage composer Kurt Weill, Italy's Luciano Berio, Russia's Dmitri Shostakovich and England's Benjamin Britten. The American composers Leonard Bernstein and Samuel Barber were also influenced by Mahler's work. In a 1989 interview the pianist-conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy said that the connection between Mahler and Shostakovich was [...] "very strong and obvious"; their music represented [...] "the individual versus the vices of the world." [...] Mitchell highlights Britten's [...] "marvellously keen, spare and independent writing for the wind in... the first movement of the Cello Symphony of 1963 [...] clearly belongs to that order of dazzling transparency and instrumental emancipation which Mahler did so much to establish." [...] Mitchell concludes with the statement: [...] "Even were his own music not to survive, Mahler would <b>still</b> <b>enjoy</b> a substantial immortality in the music of these pre-eminent successors who have embraced his art and assimilated his techniques." ...|$|E
500|$|Although it was {{omitted from}} a number of concerts because of short time allotments, Slayer have often said that they enjoy playing the album in its entirety. According to Hanneman: [...] "We <b>still</b> <b>enjoy</b> playing these songs live. We play these songs over and over and over, but they're good songs, intense songs! If it were melodic songs or some kind of boring 'clap your hands' song, you'd be going crazy playing those every night. But our songs are just bam-bam-bam-bam, they're intense." [...] The band was on stage for 70 minutes, which only allowed seven or eight {{additional}} songs to be played following the album's play. King stated this arrangement [...] "alienates too many people". In the Unholy Alliance Tour of 2004, however, the album was played in its entirety during Slayer's set as the last ten songs to end the show. The album was performed live at the I'll Be Your Mirror London festival in May 2012. In May 2014, it was announced that Slayer would perform the album in its entirety at Riot Fest in Chicago and Denver.|$|E

In 1999, when Betty was celebrating 30 years on-screen, Alison Boshoff of the Daily Mail praised the character's never changing style: [...] "for 30 years, one favourite fixture of Coronation Street has remained exactly the same [...] barmaid Betty Turpin. With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing homespun advice – and, of course, those celebrated hotpots – at the Rovers Return for more than a generation." [...] Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty Driver said, [...] "It is just amazing that I've been here for 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, because I <b>still</b> <b>enjoy</b> it so much and am always looking forward rather than back.

500|$|Seekers has {{received}} generally positive reviews. Publishers Weekly praised the suspenseful {{ending of the}} first book and thought readers would find great interest in the bears' struggle to survive. Booklist found {{the plot of the}} first book to have an [...] "interesting balance of cute anthropomorphic characterization and realistic attention to bear behaviors." [...] School Library Journal wrote [...] "from the first page, this story is exciting and refreshing" [...] and [...] "he plot is fast paced, and the author is apt at creating and sustaining the adrenaline-charged mood of these youngsters on their own." [...] Kirkus Review found that [...] "Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty, beauty, tenderness, savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery." [...] However, the reviewer also felt that too much detail went into developing the characters and setting and there was very little plot.

500|$|The Princess Royal was {{the only}} {{daughter}} {{who was able to}} marry while relatively young. The rest of the princesses were not without suitors, but most of the various men's efforts were stopped by Queen Charlotte. Most of the girls longed for families and children of their own, and often asked the Prince of Wales, to whom they remained close, for help, either in finding spouses, allowing them to marry their loves, or allowing them to live outside of Queen Charlotte's household. A grateful Sophia once jokingly wrote to her brother, saying [...] "I wonder you do not vote for putting us in a sack and drowning us in the Thames." [...] Before George became regent, he had little power to oblige his sisters. His ascension to the regency in 1811 led to Sophia and the other remaining unmarried princesses to receive increases in their allowances, from £10,000 to £13,000. He also supported their desire to venture out into society. Queen Charlotte was outraged at these attempts, and the Prince-Regent had to reconcile the two parties carefully so that his sisters could <b>still</b> <b>enjoy</b> some independence.|$|E
500|$|Early in the {{following}} season, on October 18, 2008, Crosby scored one goal and three assists to surpass benchmarks of 100goals, 200assists, and 300points for his career. On the play in which Crosby scored, teammate Malkin assisted to record his own 200th point. As a result, Crosby had a team trainer cut the puck in half so both players could commemorate the achievement. Minor injury troubles kept Crosby from five games {{early in the season}} as he was listed day-to-day, but he was, for the most part, able to bounce back from the previous injury-riddled season and stay healthy. He recorded 33 goals and 70 assists to finish third in league scoring, as Evgeni Malkin captured his first career Art Ross Trophy. Entering the 2009 playoffs as the defending Prince of Wales Trophy winners, the Penguins defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the opening round before meeting the Washington Capitals for a highly publicized second-round matchup. The series was heavily followed as it pitted Ovechkin of the Capitals against both Crosby and Malkin, who together finished as the league's top three scorers that season. In the second game, Crosby and Ovechkin recorded matching three-goal efforts for their first career playoff hat tricks in a 4–3 Capitals victory. Despite being down 2–0 in the series, Crosby and the Penguins won the next three games and eventually defeated the Capitals in a seventh and deciding game, in which Crosby added another two goals. Following a sweep of the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference Final, Crosby opted against recent NHL tradition and picked up the Prince of Wales Trophy, which he had left untouched the previous year. In explanation of the change of heart, Crosby said, [...] "We didn't touch the trophy last year, and obviously we didn't have the result we wanted ... Although we haven't accomplished exactly what we want ... we can <b>still</b> <b>enjoy</b> it." ...|$|E
