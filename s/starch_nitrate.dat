The accessions were grown in short days, moderate light, and high nitrate, and analyzed for rosette biomass, levels of structural components (protein, chlorophyll), total phenols and major metabolic intermediates (sugars, <b>starch,</b> <b>nitrate,</b> amino acids), and the activities of seven representative enzymes from central C and N metabolism. The largest variation was found for plant weight, reducing sugars, starch {{at the end of}} the night, and several enzyme activities. High levels of one sugar correlated with high levels of other sugars and starch, and a trend to increased amino acids, slightly lower nitrate, and higher protein. The activities of enzymes at the interface of C and N metabolism correlated with each other, but were unrelated to carbohydrates, amino acid levels, and total protein. Rosette weight was unrelated or showed a weak negative trend to sugar and amino acid contents {{at the end of the}} day in most of the accessions, and was negatively correlated with starch at the end of the night.

The use of delayed applications of nitrogen appears to be the best approach to the solution of the problem;No nitrogen should be applied to the soil until the plants have become established. Then, providing that a loss of soil nitrates is probable because of leaching due to heavy rainfall, an initial application of nitrogen should be made at this time. Further applications should be made if the plants continue to show symptoms of nitrogen deficiency or if other rainy periods follow. Several inorganic fertilizers and possibly uramon are suitable sources of nitrogen for side-dressing;Phosphorus and potassium are definitely limited in the soils used in the investigation and these nutrients must be supplied before beneficial effects can be secured from the use of nitrogen;Nitrogen fertilizer applications showed no consistent or pronounced effect on the storage qualities and the sugar, <b>starch</b> or soluble <b>nitrate</b> content of sweet potatoes. The use of delayed applications of nitrogen increased the colloidal nitrogen content of the roots and in one year materially reduced the loss from storage rots...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} the influence of the O 2 concentration on the combustion behaviour of a fuel/oxidizer mixture. The material tested is a ternary mixture of lactose, <b>starch</b> and potassium <b>nitrate,</b> which has already been used in an attempt of estimating the heat release rate using the FM-Global Fire Propagation Apparatus. It provides a wellcontrolled combustion section to study the evolution of the combustion products when varying the O 2 concentration, from air to low oxidizer conditions. Different chemical behaviours have been exhibited. When the O 2 concentration was reduced beyond 18 %, large variations were observed regarding CO 2 and CO concentrations. This critical O 2 concentration seems to set the distinction where the material only uses its own oxidizer to react. On the other hand, mass loss did not highlight the change in chemical reactions and remained similar whatever the test conditions. This presumes that the oxidation of CO into CO 2 are due to reactions occurring in the gas phase especially for large O 2 concentrations. This actual behaviour can be verified using a simplified model of flammability limit adapted for the current work. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out to underline the influence of CO concentration in the evaluation of heat release rate using typical calorimetric methods. The results of this study provide critical basis for the investigation of the combustion of a fuel/oxidizer mixture and for the validation of future numerical model...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn plants, the {{partitioning}} {{of carbon}} resources between growth and defense is detrimental for their development. From a metabolic viewpoint, growth is mainly related to primary metabolism including protein, amino acid and lipid synthesis, whereas defense is based notably on the biosynthesis of {{a myriad of}} secondary metabolites. Environmental factors, such as nitrate fertilization, impact the partitioning of carbon resources between growth and defense. Indeed, experimental data showed that a shortage in the nitrate fertilization resulted in a reduction of the plant growth, whereas some secondary metabolites involved in plant defense, such as phenolic compounds, accumulated. Interestingly, sucrose, a key molecule involved in the transport and partitioning of carbon resources, appeared to be under homeostatic control. Based on the inflow/outflow properties of sucrose homeostatic regulation we propose a global model on how the diversion of the primary carbon flux into the secondary phenolic pathways occurs at low nitrate concentrations. The model can account for the accumulation of starch during the light phase and the sucrose remobilization by starch degradation during the night. Day-length sensing mechanisms for variable light dark regimes are discussed, showing that growth {{is proportional to the}} length of the light phase. The model can describe the complete starch consumption during the night for plants adapted to a certain light/dark regime when grown on sufficient nitrate and can account for an increased accumulation of <b>starch</b> observed under <b>nitrate</b> limitation...|$|R

500|$|The Group's {{aim was to}} find a {{replacement}} for black-powder rocket motors—units consisting of charcoal, sulfur and potassium nitrate with a binding agent. The mixture was unstable and there were frequent explosions damaging military aircraft. The solid JATO fuel invented by Parsons consisted of amide, corn <b>starch,</b> and ammonium <b>nitrate</b> bound together in the JATO unit with glue and blotting paper. It was codenamed GALCIT-27, implying the previous invention of 26 new fuels. The first JATO tests using an ERCO Ercoupe plane took place in late July 1941; though they aided propulsion, the units frequently exploded and damaged the aircraft. Parsons theorized that this was because the ammonium nitrate became dangerously combustible following overnight storage, during which temperature and consistency changes had resulted in a chemical imbalance. Parsons and Malina accordingly devised a method in which they would fill the JATOs with the fuel in the early mornings shortly before the tests, enduring sleep deprivation to do so. On August 21, 1941, Navy Captain Homer J. Boushey, Jr.—watched by Clark Millikan and William F. Durand—piloted the JATO-equipped Ercoupe at the March Air Force Base in Moreno Valley, California. It proved a success and reduced takeoff distance by 30%, but one of the JATOs partially exploded. Over the following weeks 62 further tests took place, and the NAS increased their grant to $125,000. During a series of static experiments, an exploding JATO did significant damage to the rear fuselage of an Ercoupe; one observer optimistically noted that [...] "at least it wasn't a big hole", but necessary repairs delayed their efforts.|$|R
40|$|Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris is {{the main}} cause of most {{spoilage}} problems in fruit juices and acidic products. Since soil borne species often contaminate fruit juices and do not need strict extreme requirements for survival, it is a great concern to investigate whether and how soil species could evolve from their ecological niches in microbial community to new environments as fruit juices. In this study, 23 isolates of thermo-acidophilic, spore-forming bacteria from soil were characterized by cultural and molecular methods. In addition, 2 strains isolated from a spoilage incident in pear juice were typed. Strains phenotyping showed that they could be grouped into 3 different clusters, and some isolates showed identical or quite similar patterns. Analyzing pH and temperature ranges for growth, the majority of strains were able to grow at values described for many species of Alicyclobacillus. Qualitative utilization of lysine, arginine and indole production from tryptophan revealed, for the first time, deamination of lysine and decarboxylation of arginine. Resistance to 5 % NaCl as well as the ability to hydrolyze <b>starch</b> and gelatin, <b>nitrate</b> reduction, catalase and oxidase activities confirmed literature evidences. Examining of 16 S rRNA, showed that isolates were divided into three blocks represented by effectively soil species and strains that are moving from soil to other possible growing source characterized by parameters that could strongly influence bacterial survival. RAPD PCR technique evidenced a great variability in banding patterns and, although {{it was not possible to}} obtain genotypically well-distinguished groups, it was feasible to appreciate genetic similarity between some strains. In conclusion, the investigation of a microbial community entails a combination of metagenomic and classic culture-dependent approaches to expand our knowledge about Alicyclobacillus and to look for new subspecies...|$|R
