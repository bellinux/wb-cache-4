25|$|One of {{the most}} {{universal}} behaviors in the furry fandom {{is the creation of}} a fursona – an anthropomorphic animal representation or avatar. More than 95% of furries have a fursona – an anthropomorphic avatar or representation of themselves. Nearly half of furries report that they have only ever had one fursona to represent themselves; relatively few furries have had more than three or four fursonas; in part, {{this is due to the}} fact that, for many furries, their fursonas are a personally significant, meaningful representation of their ideal self. The most popular fursona species include wolves, foxes, dogs, large felines, and dragons. Data suggest that there are generally no associations between personality traits and different fursona species. However, furries, along with <b>sport</b> <b>fans,</b> report different degrees of personality traits when thinking of themselves in their everyday identity compared with their fan identity. Some furries identify as partly non-human: 35% say they do not feel 100% human (compared with 7% of non-furries), and 39% say they would be 0% human if they could (compared with 10% of non-furries).|$|E
25|$|The International Anthropomorphic Research Project, a team {{of social}} {{scientists}} from various disciplines led by Plante, Reysen, Roberts, and Gerbasi, has been collecting data on the furry fandom using numerous methodologies. Their 2016 publication collects several peer-reviewed and self-published studies into a single volume. Among their findings: The average adult furry is between 23–27 years of age, with more than 75% of adult furries reporting being 25 {{years of age or}} younger, and 88% of adult furries being under the age of 30. Minors {{were not included in the}} study for professional ethics reasons. Gender identity: 78-85% of furries identify as male, nearly 2% of furries identify as transgender, the remaining identify as female. Ethnicity: 83-90% of furries self-identify as White, with small minorities of furries self-identifying as Asian (2-4%), Black (2-3%), and Hispanic (3%). Furries' participation in other fandoms: 21% of furries consider themselves to be a , 44% consider themselves to be anime fans, and 11% consider themselves <b>sport</b> <b>fans.</b> Furries, as a group, are more politically liberal and less religious than the average American or other comparable fan groups such as anime fans, while still containing contentious groups such as neo-Nazis and alt-right activists whose affiliation is partly in jest and partly in earnest. Religion: 54% of furries self-identified as atheist or agnostic, 23% as Christian, 4% as Pagan, 2% as Wiccan, and the remainder identified with other religions. Approximately 70% of adult furries have either completed, or are currently completing post-secondary education.|$|E
40|$|The {{scale of}} {{professional}} sports leagues and mega sports events has expanded recently. Many <b>sports</b> <b>fans</b> travel to foreign countries to watch international events featuring the world’s top athletes or players. The number of international <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourists has increased, and understanding their behaviour {{is very important}} for stakeholders and those involved in marketing, such as sports organisations, travel companies, and government tourist organisations. This study examines the motivations and constraints of Japanese international <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourists and Japanese Rugby World Cup <b>fan</b> tourists. <b>Sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourists are tourists as well as <b>sports</b> <b>fans.</b> Many researchers have examined motivation either from a sports fan’s perspective or a tourist perspective. However, a motivation scale for international <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourists (combining both <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> and tourist motivations) has been not developed as there has been a lack of research into the behaviour of the international <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourist. The main research aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the motivation and constraint factors of both Japanese international <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourists and Japanese Rugby World Cup tourists. The methodology aims to: 1. profile Japanese international <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourists and Japanese Rugby World Cup tourists; 2. develop a motivational scale for actual <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourists and a constraints scale for potential <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourists (those who considered going but did not go); 3. analyse these factors according to demographics; 4. examine factors related to motivations and constraints on fans’ satisfaction, or their intention to attend future events. A quantitative approach was employed. The main data collection methods were three email surveys: 1. Study 1 collected data about actual international <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourists (N= 338) and potential <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourists (N= 292). 2. Study 2 collected data about actual Rugby World Cup 1987 - 2007 tourists (N= 101) and potential tourists (N= 297). 3. Study 3 collected data about actual Rugby World Cup 2011 tourists (N= 84) and potential tourists (N= 115). In previous studies, the sample was collected either from actual fans or potential fans separately; however, in this study, samples were collected not only from actual <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourists but also from potential <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourists from the same database. The data analysis predominantly used explanatory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), independent t-test, ANOVA, regression analysis, and structure equation modelling (SEM) including interaction effects analysis. The results of this study were analysed using four steps: 1. Showing the demographic profiles and behavioural patterns of Japanese international <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourists and Japanese Rugby World Cup fan tourists. 2. Developing motivation and constraints scales: • an International <b>Sports</b> <b>Fan</b> Motivation Scale • an International <b>Sports</b> <b>Fan</b> Tourist Motivation Scale • an International <b>Sports</b> <b>Fan</b> Constraints Scale • a Rugby World Cup <b>Sports</b> <b>Fan</b> Motivation Scale • a Rugby World Cup Fan Tourist Motivation Scale • a Rugby World Cup Fan Constraints Scale. 3. Comparing the mean scores of extracted factors by demographics such as gender, age, sports experiences etc. 4. Analysing the impact on satisfaction or future intention using interaction effect methods. The results showed some interesting academic and practical implications. This study has thus made a significant and unique contribution to the knowledge of international <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> behaviour by researching the combined <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> motivation factors and tourist motivation factors of actual <b>sports</b> <b>fans,</b> and the constraints of potential <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> tourists. The study has also provided an academic contribution to the sports and tourism fields, and has provided a practical contribution to the areas of <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> behaviour, tourism, leisure constraints, and sports events management...|$|R

Chad later strikes up a romance with Abigail Deveraux despite his new family's disapproval. Chad briefly moves into the mansion until he is shot in August 2011 and moves out for his own good. Chad then falls for Abigail's best friend Melanie Jonas after they share a kiss at the town's Halloween party. Meanwhile, Chad, Will and Sonny Kiriakis launch an internet website for <b>sport</b> <b>fans</b> at Salem University. However, {{they are forced to}} shut it down when criminals begin using it for illegal gambling. The criminals then kidnap Chad and Melanie and believing they are about to die, the two confess their feelings. Fortunately, they are rescued; however, Chad and Abigail break up. Abigail is initially upset about Chad and Melanie's romance, but she later gives them her blessing. Meanwhile, Chad and Gabi (Camila Banus) are forced to work together when they are both hired as models for Countess Wilhelmina. When Billie Reed (Lisa Rinna) mistakenly assumes they are dating, Gabi begins scheming to win Chad's affections. Melanie is uncomfortable with the attention Chad and Gabi are getting for their modeling campaign and their chemistry, but Chad assures her that he only has eyes for her. In the meantime, Gabi {{goes so far as to}} plant her earring in Chad's bed which interrupts Chad and Melanie's first attempt at making love. Gabi assures Melanie that her earring in Chad's bed was an accident and nothing more.|$|E

2500|$|Hawk-Eye is now {{familiar}} to <b>sport</b> <b>fans</b> {{around the world}} for the views it brings into sports like cricket and tennis. Although this new technology has for the most part been embraced, it has been criticised by from some quarters. In the 2007 Wimbledon Championships men's singles final between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, a ball that appeared out was called in by , a distance smaller than the advertised margin of error (...) [...] Some commentators have criticised the system's [...] statistical margin of error as too large. Others have noted that while [...] is extraordinarily accurate, this margin of error is only for the witnessed trajectory of the ball. In 2008, an article in a peer-reviewed journal consolidated many of these doubts. The authors acknowledged the value of the system, but noted that it was probably fallible to some extent, and that its failure to depict a margin of error gave a spurious depiction of events. The authors also argued that the probable limits to its accuracy were not acknowledged by players, officials, commentators or spectators. They hypothesised that Hawk-Eye may struggle with predicting the trajectory of a cricket ball after bouncing: the time between a ball bouncing and striking the batsman may be too short to generate the three frames (at least) needed to plot a curve accurately. However, the paper did not attempt to establish the accuracy of the system, and the only technical information presented was taken from an article on the Cricinfo website.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I offer a {{critical}} feminist interrogation of how sports fandom has been defined. Much {{of the literature}} on gender and sports fandom has been based on assumptions about the `proper 2 ̆ 7 ways to be a <b>sports</b> <b>fan.</b> Since <b>sports</b> fandom has traditionally been coded as a masculine activity that has historically excluded women, these assumptions about sports fandom in the literature often reproduce that gendered exclusion. Using semi-structured interviews with eleven women who identified as <b>sports</b> <b>fans,</b> I argue that rather than relying on dominant understandings {{of what it means to}} be a <b>sports</b> <b>fan,</b> scholars should instead foreground the voices of <b>sports</b> <b>fans</b> themselves as they describe their own understandings of what sports fandom means. Those meanings are multiple, contradictory, and profoundly gendered. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the sports}} industry, media rights, sponsorships and gate {{revenues}} are the predominant engines {{for growth and}} {{are based on the}} support of loyal fans that drive the profit potential for teams, corporate sponsors and broadcasters alike. A declining fan base can result in low revenues and disappointing profits. Literature to date has focused predominantly on the determiners and motivational aspects of fan loyalty, at the expense of understanding the deterioration {{of the relationship between the}} <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> and the <b>sports</b> team. This research investigated the concept of <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> detachment and the dissolution process of lapsed season ticket holders of the Blue Bulls rugby franchise. An extensive review of team identity and fan loyalty literature was undertaken together with the integration of brand detachment theories into a conceptual model. A qualitative study with 14 lapsed Blue Bulls season ticket holders resulted in the <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> dissolution process being defined and characterised. In-depth interviews provided a means to probe and understand the respondents’ experiences and insights. The research confirmed that <b>sports</b> <b>fans</b> progress through a three stage process of dissolution including the dissolution stage (breakdown trigger, breakdown phase and decision trigger), exit stage and post dissolution stage. The breakdown triggers were characterised as interpersonal, intrapersonal or structural in nature. The breakdown phase of <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> detachment takes place over time and is iterative in order to break the bonds with the sports object. The process is largely sequential in nature. A model of the <b>sports</b> <b>fan</b> dissolution process was developed to illustrate and summarise the findings of the research.
