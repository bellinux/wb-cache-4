5|$|In <b>soft</b> corals, {{there is}} no stony {{skeleton}} but the tissues are often toughened {{by the presence of}} tiny skeletal elements known as sclerites, which are made from calcium carbonate. <b>Soft</b> corals are very variable in form and most are colonial. A few <b>soft</b> corals are stolonate, but the polyps of most are connected by sheets of coenosarc. In some species this is thick and the polyps are deeply embedded. Some <b>soft</b> corals are encrusting or form lobes. Others are tree-like or whip-like and have a central axial skeleton embedded in the tissue matrix. This is composed either of a fibrous protein called gorgonin or of a calcified material. In both stony and <b>soft</b> corals, the polyps can be retracted, with stony corals relying on their hard skeleton and cnidocytes for defence against predators, with <b>soft</b> corals generally relying on chemical defences in the form of toxic substances present in the tissues known as terpenoids.|$|E

5000|$|Where a {{hard outer}} layer of rock covers <b>softer</b> rocks, erosion removes the <b>softer</b> {{minerals}} relatively quickly, {{and they are}} washed away from under the harder rock. The harder rocks eventually collapse under their own weight and a crater-like valley structure is formed. In Negev and Sinai makhteshim, the hard rocks are limestone and dolomite, while the inner <b>softer</b> rocks are chalk or sandstone.|$|R

5|$|According to Sugiura, Monolith Soft's {{relations}} with Namco {{had undergone a}} negative change after Nakamura retired as head of Namco in 2002, three years before the merger with Bandai. The company underwent changes and Monolith <b>Soft</b> felt they were being given less creative freedom, and the newly-created Namco Bandai was less willing to take creative risks. The company then received consultation from Shinji Hatano, an executive director at Nintendo, who advised them to continue creating innovative projects. Spurred on by Hatano's supportive attitude, Monolith <b>Soft</b> decided {{to break away from}} Namco Bandai to become a Nintendo subsidiary; this provided Monolith <b>Soft</b> creative freedom in exchange for software development exclusivity for Nintendo platforms. Nintendo's purchasing of the majority of Monolith Soft's shares from Bandai Namco Holdings was publicly announced in April 2007. Nintendo became the majority shareholder of Monolith <b>Soft</b> with 80% of shares, while Bandai Namco retained 16% and remained as a development partner. Namco Bandai stated that the exchange of Monolith <b>Soft</b> shares would strengthen their relationship with Nintendo. The remaining shares were divided between Takahashi, Sugiura and Honne. Nintendo's acquisition of Monolith <b>Soft</b> contrasted against the company's previous publicized approach of not taking part in mergers and acquisitions of other studios and companies. In a statement on the matter, then-CEO of Nintendo Satoru Iwata said that the deal was initiated due to the positive relations between Sugiura and Nintendo, and the two company's parallel design and development philosophies.|$|E

5|$|In {{a further}} change of regulations, tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli now made three {{instead of two}} tyre compounds available for each Grand Prix. For the Australian Grand Prix, these were the super-soft, <b>soft</b> and medium compounds. With Pirelli providing every driver with two sets of tyres for the race (of which one must be used) and an additional one for the third part of qualifying, drivers were able to choose ten additional sets of tyres out of the three compounds available. Notably, Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg made different choices, with Rosberg opting for an additional set of mediums instead of <b>soft</b> tyres. The two Manor drivers chose the most conservative way, taking on four sets each of the medium and <b>soft</b> compounds.|$|E

5|$|Tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli revised their tyre compounds for the 2012 {{season in}} an effort to encourage teams to use each of the compounds supplied for individual races. Pirelli predicted that the changes would translate into 0.7 seconds' difference per lap between the harder and <b>softer</b> compounds, down from 1.5 seconds per lap in 2011. According to Pirelli, the hardest tyre compound available is just 31% harder than the <b>softest</b> compound on offer; by comparison, the hardest tyres used in 2011 were 70% harder than the <b>softest.</b>|$|R
