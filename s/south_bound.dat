500|$|As soon as Soleil {{realised}} that he {{had been}} spotted he gave orders for his ships to sail to the southwest as fast as possible, hoping to outdistance the British squadron. However his convoy were all heavily laden and were therefore slower than they would normally be, while the heavy swell and strong winds favoured the large ships of the line. The chase continued throughout the night, until by 04:00 Monarch was clearly gaining on the convoy, with Centaur [...] behind. At 05:00, Captain Richard Lee was close enough to fire his bow-chasers, small guns situated at the front of his ship, at the rearmost French frigate, the Armide. Captain Jean-Jacques-Jude Langlois returned the fire with his stern-chasers and the French ships raised the Tricolour in anticipation of battle. Recognising that he was facing an overwhelming British force, Soleil split his ships, sending Thétis and the corvettes Lynx and Sylphe southwards and Infatigable to the north. This had limited success in achieving the desired effect of dividing the pursuit, with Captain William Lukin taking HMS Mars out of the British line in pursuit of Infatigable while the slow HMS Windsor Castle was sent after the three <b>south</b> <b>bound</b> ships, but {{the main body of the}} Royal Navy squadron remained on course.|$|E
500|$|North Bridge Road {{is carried}} over the railway {{and then the}} {{navigation}} at Doncaster Town Lock by North Bridge, and over the Don by St Mary's Bridge. North Bridge Road was previously part of the Great North Road. [...] Until 1910, this crossed the railway on the level before crossing the Don Navigation. [...] After 1910, a lengthy iron bridge took the road over the railway, navigation and river. [...] This bridge {{was replaced by the}} current North Bridge in 2003. [...] Its use was restricted to buses, taxis, cyclists and pedestrians from the time the new St George's Bridge opened, until 2015, when all northbound traffic was allowed to use the bridge again to help with congestion problems on St George's Bridge. <b>South</b> <b>bound</b> traffic still carries the same traffic restrictions. The new bridge was constructed {{over the top of the}} old one while it was still in situ. Once the old bridge had been stripped of its surface trimmings the deck was cut up into 25-tonne sections, which were suspended from the new structure. A pulley system was used to transport these sections along the underside of the new bridge, so that they could be lowered onto the towpath, where they were cut up further before removal from the site.|$|E
