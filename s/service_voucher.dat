50|$|Vouchers {{are sold}} {{to people who}} want to use the service. The price is subsidised, so that on the one hand the service is {{affordable}} - and for instance can compete with informal (illegal) work - and on the other provides decent condition working for the employees (including social insurance cover, holiday pay etc.). An example of this kind of subsidy regime can be found in Belgium, where service vouchers for house cleaning, laundry, ironing, sewing, cooking, running errands, and transport for people with reduced mobility are sold to people who require these services. Each person residing in Belgium with an ID card and SIS card is entitled to a quota of 500 service vouchers a year, with the first 400 service vouchers sold at a rate of 9 EUR each, and remaining 100 service vouchers sold at a rate of 10 EUR. In addition, each household has a quota of maximum 1000 service vouchers, with exceptions given to single parents and people with disabilities, who may be entitled to 2000 service vouchers, depending on the circumstances. Mothers who have just given birth, are also entitled to 105 extra service vouchers for a certain period of time. This initiative was made in order to combat the black market and has resulted in the creation of many jobs. This subsidy scheme allows for domestic workers to be declared and benefit from a legal salary, health insurance, paid holidays, and a pension; benefits that were not all possible when working on the black market. For each <b>service</b> <b>voucher,</b> a domestic servant receives a salary of 22.05 EUR, paid by both the customer and the state. In addition, tax breaks are also given to each <b>service</b> <b>voucher,</b> creating another incentive to purchase these services. Similar systems exists in France and in Sweden.|$|E

40|$|In 2000, the Belgian {{government}} {{introduced the}} <b>service</b> <b>voucher</b> system for domestic cleaning with two key objectives: (1) to promote regular {{employment in the}} neighbourhood services for groups at risk of social exclusion (2) to formalise undeclared work. Service vouchers are used as a payment system for cleaning services offered by organisations to private persons. <b>Service</b> <b>voucher</b> companies may be profit as well as not-for-profit (public or private) organisations. In the EU FP 7 project WALQING - Work and Life Quality in New and Growing Jobs –the effects of this formalisation on the job quality of domestic cleaners were assessed. To this aim, a sector study and an in-depth case study in a not-for-profit <b>service</b> <b>voucher</b> company were carried out. The formalised employment relationship between the <b>service</b> <b>voucher</b> company and the domestic cleaner that is established {{as a result of}} the <b>service</b> <b>voucher</b> system may create opportunities for improving the job quality. The analysis shows that this is indeed the outcome in the social profit organisations which use the system in line with its original objectives. These companies offer decent employment conditions (permanent contracts, decent working hours, holidays, [...] .) as well as professional human resources services (training, mediation with the client) for groups of workers that are typically deprived of such benefits. The position of the workers remains, however, at risk in small for-profit cleaning organisations entering the sector. In response to the rapid growth of the number of <b>service</b> <b>voucher</b> companies and in order to tackle these problems, the industrial relations system and the legal framework for the <b>service</b> <b>voucher</b> companies have gradually become more institutionalised and regulated. The system is, however, under threat for a number of reasons. One is the fact that, due to the explosive growth of the system, costs are escalating for the federal budget (while abolishing the system would lead cleaners getting into informality again). Another danger is that regular jobs in adjacent domestic services, such as elderly care, may be driven out by the system. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Few {{studies in}} Africa have {{explored}} {{in detail the}} ability of output-based aid (OBA) voucher programs to increase access to gender-based violence recovery (GBVR) services. Methods A qualitative {{study was conducted in}} 2010 and involved: (i) in-depth interviews (IDIs) with health managers, <b>service</b> providers, <b>voucher</b> management agency (VMA) managers and (ii) focus group discussions (FGDs) with voucher users, voucher non-users, voucher distributors and opinion leaders drawn from five program sites in Kenya. Results The findings showed promising prospects for the uptake of OBA GBVR services among target population. However, a number of factors affect the uptake of the services. These include lack of general awareness of the GBVR <b>services</b> <b>vouchers,</b> lack of understanding of the benefit package, immediate financial needs of survivors, as well as stigma and cultural beliefs that undermine reporting of cases or seeking essential medical services. Moreover, accreditation of only hospitals to offer GBVR services undermines access to the services in rural areas. Poor responsiveness from law enforcement agencies and fear of reprisal from perpetrators also undermine treatment options and access to medical services. Low provider knowledge on GBVR services and lack of supplies also affect effective provision and management of GBVR services. Conclusions The above findings suggest {{that there is a need}} to build the capacity of health care providers and police officers, strengthen the community strategy component of the OBA program to promote the GBVR <b>services</b> <b>voucher,</b> and conduct widespread community education programs aimed at prevention, ensuring survivors know how and where to access services and addressing stigma and cultural barriers. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to structurally poor job {{prospects for the}} least skilled, a number of European countries have introduced measures to boost domestic services employment. No country has done so with more fervor than Belgium. Belgian consumers can use the so-called "Service Vouchers" {{to pay for a}} limited but high volume range of domestic services like cleaning, washing and ironing. It is probably the most heavily subsidized scheme of its kind in Europe 9 ̆ 6 more than 70 per cent of the cost of services rendered to individual consumers is borne by the state. Not surprisingly, the scheme has proved tremendously popular. This contribution argues that the scheme is facing a number of particular problems and challenges. While initially many of the people employed under the scheme had experienced past unemployment spells, new recruitment has increasingly drawn on the ranks of those already in work. Furthermore, entrapment in <b>service</b> <b>voucher</b> jobs is rife, going against the purported objective of the scheme in offering a stepping stone to the regular market. Another worrying aspect is that there is some evidence of partial displacement of regular skilled workers.

40|$|Belgian anti-THB {{policy is}} often pointed as {{exemplary}} given its broad {{definition of the}} crime of trafficking for labour exploitation, as being the work or service carried out in conditions contrary to human dignity, in which the coercion element is not compulsory. However, hardly any policy initiatives in Belgium tackle specifically demand-side aspects in labour exploitation and THB in the domestic work sector. Recent policy changes in the domain of domestic work at diplomatic households and the formalisation of live-out domestic work with a <b>service</b> <b>voucher</b> policy have positive effects on the sector. Undocumented domestic workers in the shadow market and possibly regular migrants under temporary work permits are, though, still largely unprotected. The main obstacles to prevent exploitative situations within the sector are the migration and employment policies applying to domestic work. Indeed, this paper argues that when migrant workers are without the possibility to regularise their migration status maintain them in a vulnerable situation: migration status is a key issue for giving people the real possibility to access and defend their rights. Only the full respect of (all) workers’ rights will reduce their vulnerability to labour exploitation and trafficking.

50|$|Social {{protection}} measures {{to ensure that}} piped water remains affordable can be broadly classified into income support measures and tariff-related measures. Income support measures address the individual customer’s ability to pay from the income side (through income assistance, water <b>services</b> <b>vouchers,</b> tariff rebates and discounts, bill re-phasing and easier payment plans, arrears forgiveness). An example of income assistance to poor users is the subsidy system applied in Chile. Tariff-related measures keep the size of water bills low for certain groups (e.g. refinement of increasing-block tariffs, tariff choice, tariff capping). Examples of increasing block tariffs with a price of zero in the first block are found in Flanders and South Africa. Another measure is the cross-subsidization using different tariffs for different neighborhoods, as practiced in Colombia. A similar approach has been used {{at the national level}} in Portugal. The Portuguese economic water regulator carried out an affordability study that found out that 10.5% of the population paid more than 3% of their income for water and wastewater services. As a result, the regulator showed flexibility concerning tariff increases and tariff solutions in municipalities where affordability was a particular issue.|$|R

We have counted only those deliveries which were reimbursed under the voucher scheme, but non-voucher clients also accessed delivery <b>services</b> at these <b>voucher</b> <b>service</b> providers. Anecdotally, service providers reported attending non-voucher clients in approximately one quarter of total clients, so the actual difference is likely to be higher than 25 %.|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} and financial environment has become much gloomier in recent months, with the slowdown in activity and international trade, the dramatic worsening of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area {{and its impact on}} financial institutions, and the plummeting confidence of business leaders and consumers. The prospects for the euro area have therefore been sharply downgraded since all the main categories of demand are likely to contribute to the weakness of activity, including public expenditure on consumption and investment in the countries implementing fiscal consolidation measures. In Belgium, during the summer of 2011, the deterioration in the external environment, the rising financial tensions and the accompanying heightened uncertainty halted the recovery apparent since mid- 2009. According to the NAI’s flash estimates, GDP stagnated in the third quarter and growth is expected to remain close to zero {{at the end of the}} year and in early 2012. Activity is expected to pick up thereafter, but the revival is likely to be modest. GDP growth is estimated at 2 % in 2011 and 0. 5 % in 2012. These figures have been revised downwards by 0. 6 and 1. 8 percentage points respectively since the projections published in June. The slowdown in activity has brought a marked reduction in job creation, even though the figures are still supported by the expansion in the number of persons employed under the <b>service</b> <b>voucher</b> system and in the health sector and other non-market services. In net terms, the increase in the number of persons employed is expected to fall from around 56 000 units in the course of 2011 to 5 000 in 2012. The declining trend in unemployment, down from 8. 5 % in the spring of 2010 to 6. 6 % in October 2011, will be reversed in 2012. On average, the harmonised unemployment rate is put at 7 % for that year. While the recovery of GDP gradually spread to all factors of demand up to the second quarter of 2011, the resurgence of financial tensions and the widespread deterioration in the business climate and the outlook will probably affect both exports and demand for household consumption and private investment. The rise in energy prices has propelled overall inflation to more than 3 % since the beginning of 2011. Taking account of the assumption of a slight dip in oil prices compared to the previous year, inflation should gradually subside during 2012. As an annual average, inflation is forecast at 3. 5 % in 2011 and 2. 4 % in 2012, which will fuel the rise in labour costs. The projections for public finances presented in this article do not go beyond 2011, since the budgetary agreement concluded on 26 November 2011 in connection with the formation of the federal government came after the cut-off date for the projections. Public finances are expected to record a deficit of 4. 2 % of GDP at the end of 2011. The government debt ratio has increased as a result of the loans contracted by the Belgian State to finance the purchase of Dexia Bank Belgium and by the loans granted to Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

40|$|The context Quasi-market {{regulation}} {{is on the}} rise in Europe, among others in the field of personal services sector, where there are mainly low-skilled workers (Henry and al. 2009). One of the main feature of the quasi-market form of {{regulation is}} the introduction of competition between different types of providers, whether for-profit organizations or social economy organizations. One of the specificity of social economy is their social mission rather that pursuing financial return. Meanwhile, unemployment remains high in the European Union and non-standard work arrangements, precariousness tend to increase. With the Europe 2020 strategy, the EU re-opens the debate about employment. In this institutional context, the question of the links between the mission of the organization and quality of work is crucial, not only for policy objectives, but also for theory. And there is an obvious lack of fundamental research. Locating the concern within a wider literature, The quality of work is a controversial question in the empirical literature: some argue that the quality of job is worse in social economy organizations, other better. McMullen and Schellenberg (2003) have shown that non-profit-organizations in Canada offer lower wages but a better work-family balance. The presence of lower wages has been confirmed by Frank (1996), Preston (1989) and Weisbrod, (1983) but not by par Leete (2000) and Ruhm & Borkoski (2003) while Mocan & Teikin (2003) have even observed higher wages in social economy organizations. Petrella & all (2010) have shown that politics in risk prevention and the establishment of formal social dialogue are generally insufficient in the social economy sector in France and Tortia (2008) found that Italian social economy organizations offer higher autonomy and recognition to their workers. Nevertheless, the literature is agreed to say that workers in social economy organizations are generally more satisfied of their jobs, even in the presence of lower job quality. This higher satisfaction should be due to the socials values sustained by the mission of the organizations which correspond to the intrinsic motivations of their workers and therefore constitute an additional source of satisfaction for them (Frey & Goette, 1999). Analytical framework The economic literature identified two main sources of differentiation between social economy organizations and for-profit organizations (FPO) which may have an impact on job quality: First, the literature has shown that social economy organizations attract the most intrinsically motivated workers who have generally very specific motivations (Borzaga & Tortia, 2006; Meier & Stutzer, 2008; Prouteau & Wolff, 2004). Hence, social economy organizations have some interest to develop organizational practices adapted to the motivations of their workers. However, since low-skilled workers are generally in a precarious situation on the labour market and considering the nature of the tasks usually assigned to this type of worker, we may have some doubt on the capacity of these workers to be intrinsically motivated by their work. Our first contribution to the literature will be to check if social economy organizations employ low-qualified workers who are more intrinsically motivated than their counterparts in FPO. We will then be able to identify clearly the source(s) of the workers’ satisfaction. Second, the mission would have a direct impact on employment quality. In fact, the aim of the incentive structure established by any type of organization is to motivate the workers {{in the direction of the}} organization’s mission (Fehr & Falk, 2002). Since the mission of the social economy organizations and FPO are quite different, we could easily imagine that their incentive structure would not be identical. Moreover, social economy organizations would respect some principles, like the primacy of persons and work over capital in the income distribution and the process of democratic decision, which will highlights some aspects of job quality (Borzaga & Tortia, 2006). In this paper, we will contribute to the economic literature by comparing social economy organizations with FPO on the job quality in the particular case of low-skilled workers. For this study, we defined the job quality on the basis of the Munoz’s work (2009). Job quality is the combination of the following dimensions: Wages, carrier opportunities, working hours and work-family balance, job security, participation, skills development, relational aspects, autonomy, variety and creativity of the task and physical working conditions. Each of these dimensions will be captured by objective, but also subjective indicators like satisfaction. Methodology The Belgian ‘voucher system’ offers a unique field to test the impact of the mission of the organization since it is designed to foster the creation of regular salaried jobs for low-skilled persons doing housework and is open to all kinds of organizations: a variety of for-profit and not-for-profit providers compete on the market. In order to collect data, we have designed two questionnaires which will be submitted to a sample of 50 organizations during the last two months of 2011. The first one is targeted to a representative of the employer, and will be addressed in face-to-face interviews, with a view to seize job quality. The second questionnaire is targeted to a sample of workers in order to complement the information about job quality of their organization and to assess their motivations. We will also compare the socio-economic profiles of the workers between the different organizations. Finally, we will use administrative data from a database of the national Belgian office for employment that provides annual information on the contracts of all the workers involved in the <b>service</b> <b>voucher</b> system...|$|E
40|$|Luxembourg {{has been}} a country of {{immigration}} for more than 50 years. Located {{in the heart of}} Europe, it holds a strong attraction for EU citizens and nationals from countries all around the world, who {{play a central role in}} the national economy, making an important contribution to the population growth and the labour market. Over the course of 2015, Luxembourg’s population has continued its steady growth of approximately 13. 000 people per year, increasing by 2, 36 %, from 562. 958 on 1 st January 2015 to 576. 249 on 1 st January 2016. Foreign citizens have continued to play an essential role in Luxembourg’s population growth, both in terms of net migration and births. The total net migration amounted to + 11. 159 individuals in 2015, which signifies a surplus of arrivals over departures. Foreign EU citizens accounted for 76, 1 %; third-country nationals represented 32, 9 %, while Luxembourgish nationals’ contribution was negative, at - 9 %. The number of births in 2015 was the highest on record, equal to that in 2013, with 6. 115 births in total. Foreigners contributed a birth surplus of 2. 150 to Luxembourg’s natural increase, while a birth deficit of - 18 was recorded for Luxembourgish nationals. 2015 also marked a record year regarding naturalisations, with Belgians remaining the citizens that obtain citizenship most frequently, followed by the French and the Portuguese. On 1 st January 2016, 46, 7 % of Luxembourg’s residents were foreigners. Representing 34, 6 % of the total foreign population, Portuguese remained the most represented nationality, followed by France (15, 5 %) and Italy (7, 5 %), while the most numerous third-country nationals were Montenegrins. Due to the war in Syria and the influx of applicants for international protection that followed, the Syrian population living in Luxembourg showed the highest proportional increase during 2015, growing by 461, 5 % from January 2015 to January 2016. A look at Luxembourg’s labour market also reveals the central role that foreigners play in the national economy. In the first quarter of 2016, residents of Luxembourg represented 55 % of the country’s salaried workforce. Of these, 27, 5 % were Luxembourgish nationals, while EU nationals represented 24, 2 % and third-country nationals 3, 3 %. Cross-border workers from France, Belgium and Germany represented 45 % of all salaried workers in Luxembourg. They mainly work in the manufacturing industries, construction and commerce. A majority of recruitments in the HORECA sector are of foreign residents. Third-country nationals who do not benefit from free movement must be issued with a residence permit in order to enter Luxembourg. An increase in first issues of residence permits was recorded for most categories compared to the preceding year, which had experienced a decrease in almost all categories. In 2015, residence permits were most frequently issued in the “family member”, “salaried worker” and “European Blue Card” categories. 2015 was marked by a significant increase in the number of applications for international protection, which has more than doubled when compared to 2014 (2. 447 applications in 2015). While there was a strong increase at the end of 2015, the trend slowed down in 2016. Nonetheless, the number of applications for international protection remains higher than levels in 2013 / 2014. Most applications were from Syrians and Iraqis (27, 3 % and 22 % respectively), who accounted for only 9 % and 1 % respectively in 2014. Moreover, both the rate of status recognition (refugee and subsidiary protection status) and of return decision increased. In 2015, Luxembourg pledged to relocate 557 individuals to Luxembourg in the framework of the EU Council decision to relocate 160. 000 international protection applicants from Greece and Italy. Within this framework, 114 refugees have been relocated from Greece and 20 from Italy up until mid-August 2016. Furthermore, 46 refugees were resettled from Turkey in 2015, followed by 52 further refugees as a result of Luxembourg’s pledge to resettle 194 refugees from Turkey in the context of the EU-Turkey agreement of March 2016. Additionally, 44 Syrians were welcomed in 2015 following a request for assistance by German authorities. Faced with the increased inflow of applicants for international protection, an emergency reception plan was developed in 2015. The plan included the establishment of first-instance reception centres and the strengthening of the capacity in human resources of both the Luxembourg Reception and Integration Agency (OLAI) and the Directorate of Immigration, which is under the authority of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The OLAI also strengthened the collaboration with stakeholders at inter-ministerial and local levels. A strong focus has also been put on integration, where major developments include the setting up of integration projects by the municipalities in the context of the ‘Communal Integration Plan’ project and the creation of Luxembourg’s Centre for Integration and Cohesion (LISKO), a service supporting the beneficiaries of international protection in their process of integration in Luxembourgish society. Over the course of 2015 and 2016, Luxembourg continued to transpose and implement several EU directives. The law of 18 th December 2015 on the reception of applicants for international protection and temporary protection transposes Directive 2013 / 33 /EU (re-cast reception conditions) into national law. The law of 18 th December 2015 on international protection and temporary protection transposed Directive 2013 / 32 /EU (re-cast procedure), establishing the procedures for granting and withdrawing international and subsidiary protection and the standardisation of the content of this protection. The bill implementing Directive 2013 / 55 /EU on the recognition of professional qualifications was introduced into parliament in 2015 and the bill implementing Directive 2014 / 36 /EU on seasonal workers and Directive 2014 / 66 /EU on intra-corporate transferees and investors’ residence permits was introduced in 2016. Regarding the transposition of the Blue Card Directive, a Government Decree was issued on 22 nd May 2015 establishing the professions to which the lower salary threshold for hiring highly qualified workers applies. On the national level, a number of legislative changes address some of the challenges set by Luxembourg’s heterogeneity. The bill no. 6410 on youth, introduced into parliament on 6 th February 2015, gives cross-border workers access to the care <b>service</b> <b>voucher</b> system which was previously only available to Luxembourgish residents. Bill no. 6893 on the recognition of qualifications was introduced in parliament in October 2015. At the referendum of 7 th June 2015, the proposal to extend the right to vote of non-Luxembourgish residents was rejected by a large majority, who argued in favour of the acquisition of nationality as the more appropriate way to acquire the right to vote. Consequently, the government took steps towards reforming the law on nationality in order to soften the requirements for acquisition of nationality, and in this way enable the broadening of participation in elections. Bill no. 6977 on nationality was introduced in parliament on 24 th March 2016. It includes the reduction of the required duration of residency from seven to five years and the reintroduction of procedure of option in cases of close links with Luxembourg. The level of fluency in Luxembourgish required has become a central focus of the debate on the bill on nationality, some fearing that linguistic requirements would become an obstacle to foreigners’ acquisition of nationality, others underlining the command of the language as a central factor in integration and thus also in the acquisition of nationality. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Current {{assessments}} on Output-Based Aid (OBA) {{programs have}} paid limited {{attention to the}} experiences and perceptions of the healthcare providers and facility managers. This study examines the knowledge, attitudes, and experiences of healthcare providers and facility managers in the Kenya reproductive health output-based approach voucher program. Methods: A total of 69 in-depth interviews with healthcare providers and facility managers in 30 voucher accredited facilities were conducted. The study hypothesized that a voucher program {{would be associated with}} improvements in reproductive health service provision. Data were transcribed and analyzed by adopting a thematic framework analysis approach. A combination of inductive and deductive analysis was conducted based on previous research and project documents. Results: Facility managers and providers viewed the RH-OBA program as a feasible system for increasing service utilization and improving quality of care. Perceived benefits of the program included stimulation of competition between facilities and capital investment in most facilities. Awareness of family planning (FP) and gender-based violence (GBV) recovery <b>services</b> <b>voucher,</b> however, remained lower than the maternal health <b>voucher</b> <b>service.</b> Relations between the voucher management agency and accredited facilities as well as existing health systems challenges affect program functions. Conclusions: Public and private sector healthcare providers and facility managers perceive value in the voucher program as a healthcare financing model. They recognize that {{it has the potential to}} significantly increase demand for reproductive health services, improve quality of care and reduce inequities in the use of reproductive health services. To improve program functioning going forward, there is need to ensure the benefit package and criteria for beneficiary identification are well understood and that the public facilities are permitted greater autonomy to utilize revenue generated from the voucher program...|$|R

30|$|By linking {{facility}} reimbursements to {{the demand}} for specific <b>services,</b> the <b>voucher</b> programme was able to work on both the demand- and supply-side to improve uptake of important but underutilised health services in the target areas. In the current context of continuing instability and increasing scarcity of basic commodities in Yemen, the principal supply-side effects of the voucher programme in Yemen were to enable continued funds flow to the facilities when government funds were unreliable or ceased; continuity of service provision, even during the worst days of the crisis; the flexibility and capacity {{at the local level}} to address stock-outs of drugs and supplies; and support for quality assurance of both public and private providers.|$|R
30|$|Against this backdrop, the Yamaan Foundation for Health and Social Development in Yemen (Yamaan), {{with support}} from Options Consultancy Services (Options), {{developed}} a voucher programme that facilitates access to a highly subsidised package of reproductive and safe motherhood services for poor Yemeni women in two governorates. In addition to <b>services,</b> the <b>vouchers</b> provide access to free transport to the health facility for delivery and a contribution towards the costs of accommodation and food for a chaperone. In this way, the vouchers reduce financial and other barriers to accessing care while channelling funds to contracted public and private service providers {{that can be used}} to fill financing gaps at the local level and improve service quality.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Geographical inaccessibility, lack of transport, and {{financial}} burdens {{are some of}} the demand side constraints to maternal health services in Uganda, while supply side problems include poor quality services related to unmotivated health workers and inadequate supplies. Most public health interventions in Uganda have addressed only selected supply side issues, and universities have focused their efforts on providing maternal services at tertiary hospitals. To demonstrate how reforms at Makerere University College of Health Sciences (MakCHS) can lead to making systemic changes that can improve maternal health services, a demand and supply side strategy was developed by working with local communities and national stakeholders. Methods This quasi-experimental trial is conducted in two districts in Eastern Uganda. The supply side component includes health worker refresher training and additions of minimal drugs and supplies, whereas the demand side component involves vouchers given to pregnant women for motorcycle transport and the payment to service providers for antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care. The trial is ongoing, but early analysis from routine health information systems on the number of services used is presented. Results Motorcyclists in the community organized themselves to accept vouchers in exchange for transport for antenatal care, deliveries and postnatal care, and have become actively involved in ensuring that women obtain care. Increases in antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care were demonstrated, with the number of safe deliveries in the intervention area immediately jumping from Conclusions Transport and <b>service</b> <b>vouchers</b> appear to be a viable strategy for rapidly increasing maternal care. MakCHS can design strategies together with stakeholders using a learning-by-doing approach to take advantage of community resources. </p...|$|R
40|$|Storage systems manage quota {{to ensure}} that each user gets the storage they need, {{and that no one}} user can—even by accident—use up all {{available}} storage. This is difficult for large, distributed systems, especially those used for high-performance computing applications, because resource allocation occurs on many nodes concurrently. We present a scheme where quota is enforced asynchronously by intelligent storage servers: storage clients contact a shared management <b>service</b> to get <b>vouchers,</b> a capabilitylike certificate that the clients can redeem at participating storage servers to allocate storage space. This approach produces low load on the shared management service, promotes good scaling, and allows the client to make decisions about which storage server(s) to use without communicating with the management service for further approval. Storage servers and the management <b>service</b> periodically reconcile <b>voucher</b> usage {{to ensure that}} clients do not cheat by spending the same voucher at multiple storage servers. We report on a simulation study that shows that this approach gives performance nearly as good as not enforcing quota at all, and that the load on the shared management server is remarkably low. ...|$|R
