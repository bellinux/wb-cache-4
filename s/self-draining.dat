5000|$|Flooding: Almost {{all working}} mines require pumps to remove water, with the {{exception}} of those being <b>self-draining</b> via deep drainage adits. Once a mine is abandoned, the pumps are usually turned off and the mine slowly fills with water until a level is reached where water can drain out: this is usually the lowest adit. However, it is possible to find flooded sections in mines which are above a dry adit as workings are often very complex: in some cases reservoirs may have been created in higher chambers to provide power for machinery below.|$|E
50|$|Sole-the {{floor of}} a cabin or cockpit. Often the cabin floor is made in {{sections}} that can be lifted quickly {{to gain access to}} the bilges in the event of a leak. Cockpit floors on yachts are often <b>self-draining</b> so that water will drain out even when the vessel is sailing at an extreme angle. In many high speed skiffs the craft is fitted with a sole angled aft to rapidly drain the spray through an open transom. Often this type of sole is called a false floor.|$|E
50|$|The Laser 4000 was {{designed}} in 1994 by yacht designer Phil Morrison. It is a sloop rigged dinghy constructed from fiberglass. It features a single trapeze {{as well as}} an open, <b>self-draining</b> cockpit. Instead of a conventional kicking strap it features a gnav system, which pushes down on the boom from the top, instead of pulling from the bottom. This allows greater space for the crew to move from side to side.Boat manufacture is well known to be of a very high quality and durability, thus hulls from the very first molds are still competing effectively.|$|E
50|$|She {{had a long}} flat floor, flared out {{to project}} at both head and stern. She was steered by a long sweep over the stern. Fourteen {{copper-clad}} water-tight cases, five on each side and four down the mid line provided buoyancy. Oars and two foul-weather sprit-sails provided propulsion and there was provision for <b>self-draining</b> when she was fully waterlogged. About 30’ overall and 7’ breadth, she was capable of supporting 25 men even when flooded. Her normal crew was six oarsmen and a coxswain. Gower remarked very emphatically that a coxswain should be in constant charge of her; for without such an experienced man, she would be almost useless.|$|E
50|$|The {{full-length}} deckhouse {{is built}} of Georgia pine, with a similarly constructed pilothouse on top, set slightly {{back from the}} front of the deckhouse.

A saloon fills the front of the deckhouse, finished with oak match board. Aft of a bulkhead a companionway ladder leads to the pilothouse. The middle of the deckhouse covers the boiler and engine room spaces. The rear of the deckhouse contains the galley, provided with a Shipmate coal-burning stove. The deckhouse ends at toilets, officers to port and crew to starboard.|$|E
50|$|Fisher's second {{innovation}} was {{the notion}} that the target CPU architecture should be designed to be a reasonable target for a compiler; that the compiler and the architecture for a VLIW processor must be codesigned. This was inspired partly by the difficulty Fisher observed at Yale of compiling for architectures like Floating Point Systems' FPS164, which had a complex instruction set computing (CISC) architecture that separated instruction initiation from the instructions that saved the result, needing very complex scheduling algorithms. Fisher developed a set of principles characterizing a proper VLIW design, such as <b>self-draining</b> pipelines, wide multi-port register files, and memory architectures. These principles made it easier for compilers to emit fast code.|$|E

5000|$|In early 1953, Saunders-Roe at Anglesey {{completed}} the Mark 3 airborne lifeboat to be fitted underneath the Avro Shackleton maritime reconnaissance aircraft. The Mark 3 was made entirely of aluminium unlike the Fox Mark 1 {{which was made}} of wood. Dropped from a height of 700 ft, the Mark 3 descended under four 42 ft parachutes {{at a rate of}} 20 ft per second into the rescue zone. As the lifeboat dropped, pressurized bottles of carbon dioxide inflated the self-righting chambers at the bow and stern. Upon touching the water, the parachutes were released to blow away, and a drogue opened to slow the boat's drift and aid in the survivors reaching the lifeboat. At the same time, two rockets fired, one to each side, sending out floating lines to provide easier access to the lifeboat for ditched airmen. Doors that opened from the outside provided access to the interior, and the flat deck was made to be <b>self-draining.</b> The craft was powered by a Vincent Motorcycles HRD T5 [...] engine with enough fuel to give a range of 1250 mi. Sails and a fishing kit were provided, as well as an awning and screen to protect against sun and sea spray.

In the 1930s, he designed the 'Galleon Wing' extension to Said House, Chiswick Mall for Sir Nigel Playfair incorporating a huge curved plate-glass window for the first floor Drawing Room (the location for Series One of the BBC reality programme The Apprentice) and, presumably through his step-daughter Veronica Pease's father-in-law Lord Gainford, a cousin of Beaumont Pease and first chairman of the BBC, Studio 3A at Broadcasting House. For competition entries and other connections of his wife including Lord Strathcona and Sir Evelyn Wrench, Wells submitted some very advanced designs ahead of contemporary modernism for a series of London sites through the 1920s and 30s, none of which was built. Beaumont Pease, as chairman of Lloyds Bank, also commissioned Wells for the bank's branch at Teddington, Middlesex.|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) with dry feeds has been examined with different fuel cell flow channel designs as functions of pressure, temperature and flow rate. Auto-humidified (or self-humidifying) PEMFC operation is improved at higher pressures and low gas velocities where axial dispersion enhances back-mixing {{of the product}} water with the dry feed. We demonstrate auto-humidified {{operation of}} the channel-less, <b>self-draining</b> fuel cell, based on a stirred tank reactor; data is presented showing auto-humidified operation from 25 to 115 degrees C at 1 and 3 atm. Design and operating requirements are derived for the auto-humidified operation of the channel-less, <b>self-draining</b> fuel cell. The auto-humidified <b>self-draining</b> fuel cell outperforms a fully humidified serpentine flow channel fuel cell at high current densities. The new design offers substantial benefits for simplicity of operation and control including: the ability to self-drain reducing flooding, the ability to uniformly disperse water removing current gradients {{and the ability to}} operate on dry feeds eliminating the need for humidifiers. Additionally, the design lends itself well to a modular design concept. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the power output from a PEM fuel cell can be directly regulated by limiting the hydrogen feed to the fuel cell. Regulation is accomplished by varying the internal resistance of the membrane–electrode assembly in a <b>self-draining</b> fuel cell with the effluents connected to water reservoirs. The fuel cell functionally operates as a dead-end design where no gas flows out of the cell and water is permitted to flow {{in and out of}} the gas flow channel. The variable water level in the flow channel regulates the internal resistance of the fuel cell. The hydrogen and oxygen (or air) feeds are set directly to stoichiometrically match the current, which then control the water level internal to the fuel cell. Standard PID feedback control of the reactant feeds has been incorporated to speed up the system response to changes in load. With dry feeds of hydrogen and oxygen, 100 % hydrogen utilization is achieved with 130 % stoichiometric feed on the oxygen. When air was substituted for oxygen, 100 % hydrogen utilization was achieved with stoichiometric air feed. Current regulation is limited by the size of the fuel cell (which sets a minimum internal impedance), and the dynamic range of the mass flow controllers. This type of regulation could be beneficial for small fuel cell systems where recycling unreacted hydrogen may be impractical...|$|E
40|$|Agranovski and Braddock [AIChE J. 4 (1998) 2784] {{investigated}} {{a process}} of filtration of ultra small liquid particles on wettable fibrous filters. They found that liquid droplets captured by a wettable filter spread along the fibres and create a thin liquid film covering each fibre. These films of liquid establish a <b>self-draining,</b> tapered equilibrium flow down the filter. The thickness of the liquid film is an important parameter altering the physical characteristics and performance of the filter. The properties of the film depend on the density, viscosity and amount of liquid present, the physical parameters, wettability and dimensions of the filter and also on the orientation and angle of inclination of the filter. The thickness of the liquid film can be increased by increasing the angle of inclination of the filter and by selecting the orientation. It leads {{to the possibility of}} increasing the efficiency of wet filtration without any increase in the amount of irrigating liquid involved. It is especially important for industries where, due to some technological or economical reasons, the amount of fresh irrigating liquid available for the process, is limited. In the current paper, the results of theoretical and experimental analysis of inclined wettable filtration systems are presented and further steps towards industrial design are discussed.

40|$|During operations, NOvA {{produces}} between 5, 000 and 7, 000 raw files per {{day with}} peaks {{in excess of}} 12, 000. These files must be processed in several stages to produce fully calibrated and reconstructed analysis files. In addition, many simulated neutrino interactions must be produced and processed through the same stages as data. To accommodate the large volume of data and Monte Carlo, production must be possible both on the Fermilab grid and on off-site farms, {{such as the ones}} accessible through the Open Science Grid. To handle the challenge of cataloging these files and to facilitate their off-line processing, we have adopted the SAM system developed at Fermilab. SAM indexes files according to metadata, keeps track of each file's physical locations, provides dataset management facilities, and facilitates data transfer to off-site grids. To integrate SAM with Fermilab's art software framework and the NOvA production workflow, we have developed methods to embed metadata into our configuration files, art files, and standalone ROOT files. A module in the art framework propagates the embedded information from configuration files into art files, and from input art files to output art files, allowing us to maintain a complete processing history within our files. Embedding metadata in configuration files also allows configuration files indexed in SAM to be used as inputs to Monte Carlo production jobs. Further, SAM keeps track of the input files used to create each output file. Parentage information enables the construction of <b>self-draining</b> datasets which have become the primary production paradigm used at NOvA.

40|$|AbstractScrap tyre derived {{aggregates}} (TDA) {{have been}} used in civil engineering since 1990 -ties, mainly in the USA. The material may be used in various forms and sizes – from powder, through granulates, tyre shreds, chips. The TDA applications include: lightweight fills in embankments over soft soils, lightweight backfills behind retaining walls, insulation and drainage layers etc. In most of the works the material needs to be compacted to decrease the void ratio of the aggregate and reduce future settlement. This paper presents a study on compactness of four different fractions of scrap tyre rubber (A: 0. 1 – 1 mm, B: 0. 5 – 2 mm, C: 2 – 5 mm and D: 10 – 40 mm) in the standard Proctor test. The results in the form of dependency of dry and bulk density on water content are compared also with adequate results obtained for a clean uniform medium sand. It turns out that the optimum moisture content can be clearly estimated only {{in the case of the}} finest fraction (sample A) and it is equal to about 40 %. The variability of dry density is however small – it changes from 0. 54 to 0. 61 g/cm 3. Coarser TDAs behave more like <b>self-draining</b> materials – they retain much less water and the maximum moisture content equals to about 18 %, 23 % and 38 % in case of tyre chips (D), 2 – 5 mm grains (C) and 0. 5 – 2 mm grains (B) respectively.

40|$|AbstractA {{prerequisite}} for vaccine-mediated induction of CD 8 + T-cell responses is the targeting of dendritic cell (DC) subsets specifically capable of cross-presenting antigen epitopes to CD 8 + T cells. Administration {{of a number}} of cationic adjuvants via the intraperitoneal (i. p.) route has been shown to result in strong CD 8 + T-cell responses, whereas immunization via e. g. the intramuscular (i. m.) or subcutaneous (s. c.) routes often stimulate weak CD 8 + T-cell responses. The hypothesis for this is that self-drainage of the adjuvant/antigen to the lymphoid organs, which takes place upon i. p. immunization, is required for the subsequent activation of cross-presenting lymphoid organ-resident CD 8 α+ DCs. In contrast, s. c. or i. m. immunization usually results in the formation of a depot at the site of injection (SOI), which hinders the self-drainage and targeting of the vaccine to cross-presenting CD 8 α+ DCs. We investigated this hypothesis by correlating the biodistribution pattern and the adjuvanticity of the strong CD 8 + T-cell inducing liposomal cationic adjuvant formulation 09 (CAF 09), which is composed of dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide/monomycoloyl glycerol liposomes with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid electrostatically adsorbed to the surface. Biodistribution studies with radiolabeled CAF 09 and a surface-adsorbed model antigen [ovalbumin (OVA) ] showed that a significantly larger fraction of the vaccine dose localized in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and the spleen 6 h after i. p. immunization, as compared to after i. m. immunization. Studies with fluorescently labelled OVA+CAF 09 demonstrated a preferential association of OVA+CAF 09 to DCs/monocytes, as compared to macrophages and B cells, following i. p. immunization. Administration of OVA+CAF 09 via the i. p. route did also result in DC activation, whereas no DC activation could be measured within the same period with unadjuvanted OVA and OVA+CAF 09 administered via the s. c. or i. m. routes. In the dLNs, the highest level of activated, cross-presenting CD 8 α+ DCs was detected at 24 h post immunization, whereas an influx of activated, migrating and cross-presenting CD 103 + DCs to the dLNs could be measured after 48 h. This suggests that the CD 8 α+ DCs are activated by <b>self-draining</b> OVA+CAF 09 in the lymphoid organs, whereas the CD 103 + DCs are stimulated by the OVA+CAF 09 at the SOI. These results support the hypothesis that the self-drainage of OVA+CAF 09 to the draining LNs is required for the activation of CD 8 α+ DCs, while the migratory CD 103 + DCs {{may play a role in}} sustaining the subsequent induction of strong CD 8 + T-cell responses...|$|E
