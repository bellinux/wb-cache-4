40|$|Sequence {{analysis}} was performed of an ovine hypothalamic 41 -residue polypeptide that had been postulated to be a putative corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) because of its high intrinsic corticotropin releasing activity. The NH 2 -terminal 39 residues of CRF were determined by Edman degradation of 0. 6 - 3. 5 nmol of peptide in a Wittmann-Liebold modified Beckman 890 C <b>spinning</b> <b>cup</b> sequencer with reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography for the identification of amino acid phenylthiohydantoins (direct micro-sequence analysis). Evidence for residue 40 (isoleucine) was provided by direct micro-sequence analysis of 2. 0 nmol of acetylated CRF selectively cleaved at its arginine residues by trypsin prior to analysis. The thermolytic COOH-terminal fragment isoleucyl-alanineamide was characterized as its dansyl derivative. Based on the analytical data, the following primary structure is proposed for ovine hypothalamic CRF: H-Ser-Gln-Glu-Pro-Pro-Ile-Ser-Leu-Asp-Leu-Thr-Phe-His-Leu-Leu-Arg-Glu-Val-Leu-Glu-Met-Thr-Lys-Ala-Asp-Gln-Leu-Ala-Gln-Gln-Ala-His-Ser-Asn-Arg-Lys-Leu-Leu-Asp -Ile-Ala-NH 2.

40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of superphosphate by the acidulation of phosphate rock with sulphuric acid, fluorine is evolved, mainly as silicon tetrafluoride, along with carbon dioxide and steam. This environmentally unacceptable fluoride is required to be removed before being vented to the atmosphere. This is usually done by absorbing the gas in water. However, industrially the absorption {{is complicated by the}} presence of entrained phosphate rock dust, mist particles and condensing steam in the gas stream, and by the silica formed from the reaction between silicon tetrafluoride and water. The absorption of dry silicon tetrafluoride in water under laboratory conditions is reasonably well understood. However, information on the absorption under industrial conditions is lacking. In all industrial measurements of the mass transfer coefficient the liquid-gas interfacial area is not known accurately and hence what is usually obtained is a coefficient per unit volume of the absorption equipment. This value is of limited use in exploring the effect of particulates and surface reaction as it is a complex average for different drop sizes and scrubber volumes and the chemical composition of the gas stream. Gas absorption, particulate collection and surface reaction need to be considered separately in comparing industrial scrubbers. Therefore {{in order to be able}} to translate the performance of a given scrubber from one works to another, the measurement of the mass transfer coefficient for one standard geometry in industrial conditions is needed. Thus the aim of this work is to establish a method of providing this information. By using a <b>spinning</b> <b>cup</b> sampling apparatus we were not only able to establish a method of determining a mass transfer coefficient for the absorption of the industrial effluent gas stream fluorides, but were also able to establish a method for determining the size of the particulate fluorides present in the gas stream. The main points arising from this work include: (1) The absorption is "gas" phase controlled (under normal conditions surface silica is unimportant) and the particulate fluorides in the gas stream will often be the controlling factor in scrubber performance. Thus the collection of particulate fluorides must be a primary concern in scrubber design, and high liquid to gas ratios in some section of a scrubber will promote this collection. (2) The particulate fluorides are small, of the order of 2 micrometers in diameter. (3) In the <b>spinning</b> <b>cup</b> apparatus used in this study, the mass transfer coefficient for a "gas" stream containing 25 % particulate fluorides at 90 to 100 °C is approximately 55 m h-¹...|$|R

Polybrene was used as a substrate coating to better anchor proteins and peptides,and the purification of reagents was improved. HPLC analysis techniques were used to reduce analysis times and extend the technique's applicable range.The amount of protein required for an analysis decreased, from 10-100 nanomoles for Edman and Begg's protein sequencer, to the low picomole range, a revolutionary increase in the sensitivity of the technology. The new sequencer offered significant advantages in speed and sample size compared to commercial sequencers of the time, the most popular of which were built by Beckman Instruments.Commercialized as the Model 470A protein sequencer, it allowed scientists to determine partial amino acid sequences of proteins that had not previously been accessible, characterizing new proteins and better understanding their activity, function, and effects in therapeutics. These discoveries had significant ramifications in biology, medicine, and pharmacology.|$|R

50|$|Teacups is an {{amusement}} ride characterized by cup-style spinning vehicles atop a turntable-like floor. Typically, {{each set of}} six teacups has a center bearing mounted underneath, similar to a car wheel bearing mounted on a circular floor capable of turning 360°. The circular floor of the cup sits on a larger turntable-like floor. This is driven by a motor through a starting device; the ride when started begins to spin slowly and build up speed as the operator applies more power. When in operation, the ride operator <b>spins</b> each <b>cup</b> while the turntable spins the entire ride base. They are driven by a motor fixed to the base in either the middle or the outside, the motor fixed in the middle has a gearbox which changes direction, as well as gives the correct ratio to the desired speed.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{wrinkling}} {{failure in}} conventional spinning of a cylindrical cup {{has been investigated}} by using both finite element (FE) analysis and experimental methods. FE simulation models of a spinning experiment have been developed using the explicit finite element solution method provided by the software Abaqus. The severity of wrinkles is quantified by calculating the standard deviation of the radial coordinates of element nodes {{on the edge of}} the workpiece obtained from the FE models. The results show that the severity of wrinkles tends to increase when increasing the roller feed ratio. A forming limit study for wrinkling has been carried out and shows that there is a feed ratio limit beyond which the wrinkling failure will take place. Provided that the feed ratio is kept below this limit, the wrinkling failure can be prevented. It is believed that high compressive tangential stresses in the local forming zone are the causes of the wrinkling failure. Furthermore, the computational performance of the solid and shell elements in simulat-ing the spinning process are examined and the tool forces obtained from wrinkling and wrinkle-free models are compared. Finally, the effects of the feed ratio on variations of the wall thickness of the <b>spun</b> cylindrical <b>cup</b> are investigated...|$|R

50|$|When {{water in}} a {{circular}} bowl or cup is moving in circular motion the water displays vortex flow - the water {{at the center of}} the bowl or <b>cup</b> <b>spins</b> at relatively high speed, and the water at the perimeter spins more slowly. The water is a little deeper at the perimeter and a little more shallow at the center, and the surface of the water is not flat but displays the characteristic depression toward the axis of the spinning fluid. At any elevation within the water the pressure is a little greater near the perimeter of the bowl or cup where the water is a little deeper, than near the center. The water pressure is a little greater where the water speed is a little slower, and the pressure is a little less where the speed is faster, and this is consistent with Bernoulli's principle.|$|R
