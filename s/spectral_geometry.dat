40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of solutions}} to the partial differential equation (D + λ W) f_λ = 0 is discussed, where D is a normal hyperbolic partial differential operator, or pre-normal hyperbolic operator, on n-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The potential term W is a C_ 0 ^∞ kernel operator which, in general, will be non-local in time, and λ is a complex parameter. A result is presented which states that there are unique advanced and retarded Green's operators for this partial differential equation if |λ| is small enough (and also for a larger set of λ values). Moreover, a scattering operator can be defined if the λ values admit advanced and retarded Green operators. In general, however, the Cauchy-problem will be ill-posed, and examples {{will be given to}} that effect. It will also be explained that potential terms arising from non-commutative products on function spaces can be approximated by C_ 0 ^∞ kernel operators and that, thereby, scattering by a non-commutative potential can be investigated, also when the solution spaces are (2 nd) quantized. Furthermore, a discussion will be given which links the scattering transformations, which thereby arise from non-commutative potentials, to observables of quantum fields on non-commutative spacetimes through "Bogoliubov's formula". In particular, this helps to shed light on the question how observables arise for quantum fields on Lorentzian <b>spectral</b> <b>geometries.</b> Comment: Latex 2 e, 18 pp. Contribution to the proceedings of the conference "Quantum Mathematical Physics" (Regensburg, October 2014...|$|R
