The symptoms that are seen most often are the typical <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> the individual autoimmune diseases and include Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, myositis and scleroderma. Treatment {{of these patients}} is symptomatic and is similar to treatment for the individual autoimmune disease, often involving either immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs.|$|E

5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.|$|E
30|$|Conclusions HFNC can {{ameliorate}} the <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> {{the mild}} to moderate ARDS, but the effect in the severe ARDS isn't certain. So, the <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> patients must have been monitored frequently {{in order to avoid}} missing the chance of intubation.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Generalized anxiety {{disorder}} (GAD) is a commonly occurring {{anxiety disorder}} {{that many times}} is characterized by an onset in adolescence and symptoms that increase in severity Into adulthood Due to the persistent nature of the disorder's primary <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> worry, which appears more related to a personality trait than an anxiety state, the current DSM-IV nosology of GAD has been debated. Recently, evidence is accumulating that suggests that the GAD <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> worry is strongly related to the personality trait of neuroticism. This study investigates whether the GAD <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> worry and neuroticism are best explained as 1 general factor or as 2 distinct entities in adolescents. Additionally, the Interrelation over time between the GAD <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> worry and neuroticism in adolescents is examined. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The {{clinical}} signs and <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> AML {{result from the}} growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere {{with the development of}} normal blood cells in the bone marrow. This leads to neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML can develop a chloroma, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow, which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E
5|$|The motor <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> PD are {{the result}} of reduced {{dopamine}} production in the brain's basal ganglia. Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so it cannot be taken as a medicine to boost the brain's depleted levels of dopamine. However a precursor of dopamine, levodopa, can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to dopamine, and administration of levodopa temporarily diminishes the motor <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> PD. Levodopa has been the most widely used PD treatment for over 40 years.|$|E

When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>of</b> a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E

5|$|Amanita bisporigera was {{described}} as a new species in 1906. It is classified in the section Phalloideae of the genus Amanita together with other amatoxin-containing species. Amatoxins are cyclic peptides which inhibit the enzyme RNA polymerase II and interfere with various cellular functions. The first <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> poisoning appear 6 to 24 hours after consumption, followed by a period of apparent improvement, then by <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> liver and kidney failure, and death after four days or more. Amanita bisporigera closely resembles a few other white amanitas, including the equally deadly A.virosa and A.verna. These species, difficult to distinguish from A.bisporigera based on visible field characteristics, do not have two-spored basidia, and do not stain yellow when a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide is applied. The DNA of A.bisporigera has been partially sequenced, and the genes responsible for the production of amatoxins have been determined.|$|E
