5|$|Harvard had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> {{finding a}} {{replacement}} for Gray that they considered hiring a European, but they found an American and hired George Lincoln Goodale in late 1872. Goodale had a medical degree from Harvard and a solid knowledge of botany. By late June 1873 Goodale had enough experience that Gray was exalted to pronounce he had taught his last class. William Gilson Farlow also had a medical degree from Harvard and had studied botany. He became Gray's assistant in 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in Europe for a few years. He returned to Harvard in 1874 and became a botany professor. Sereno Watson began helping Gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became the herbarium curator. The reorganization of botany at Harvard in the early 1870s was a major accomplishment of Gray's.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the family}} have all {{begun to take}} extra jobs to pay for Chris's tuition; Peter sells butt scratchers at the ballpark, Lois and Meg begin working as prostitutes, and Stewie decides to follow {{overweight}} park-goers, while playing the tuba, making them fall. As this is happening, Chris starts to feel uncomfortable with his membership at the Skull and Bones, especially after one of their activities involves teasing an orphan they had pretended to adopt. Feeling his family should not go through <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> to keep him satisfied, Chris asks Carter {{to help him get}} back into his old school. Carter complies with his request, and Chris moves back home, and returns to James Woods High School. At the end of the episode, Stewie plays the tuba for Chris, making him fall.|$|E

While there, he played clarinet {{in the school}} band and became a co-editor (along with [...] Madelyn Pugh) for the Tuesday edition of the school newspaper, The Shortridge Echo. Vonnegut said his tenure with the Echo allowed him to write for a large audience—his fellow students—rather than for a teacher, an experience he said was [...] "fun and easy". [...] "It just turned out that I could write better {{than a lot of}} other people", Vonnegut observed.

500|$|As an {{advocate}} for campaign finance reform, Mathias refused to accept any contribution over $100 to [...] "avoid the curse of big money {{that has led to}} <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> in the last year". However, he still managed to raise over $250,000, nearly five times Mikulski's total. Ideologically, Mikulski and Mathias agreed on many issues, such as closing tax loopholes and easing taxes on the middle class. On two issues, however, Mathias argued to reform Congress and the U.S. tax system to address inflation and corporate price fixing, contrary to Mikulski. In retrospect, The Washington Post felt the election was [...] "an intelligent discussion of state, national, and foreign affairs by two smart, well-informed people".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} {{newspaper}} pieces about the K Foundation appeared in The Guardian the following Monday, correctly {{pointing out that the}} shortlist and exhibition were actually for the 1993 Turner Prize, the controversial £20,000 annual award given by the UK art establishment to the best young contemporary artist, but assuming that the K Foundation prize was a hoax. [...] "As for the K Foundation", the newspaper wrote, [...] "it stands unmasked as the current performing face of those cherished old friends of pop pranksterdom, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty", formerly known as The KLF. In September, the organisers of the Turner Prize responded publicly that [...] "It proves the validity of our prize that somebody would take <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> to set up this award".|$|E

In {{an interview with}} Noisey's Rebecca Haithcoat, Keef told Haithcoat his favorite part about Los Angeles is, [...] "the quiet." [...] After moving to Los Angeles, Keef began indulging in his new-found hobby of art collecting, once he discovered the paintings of art teacher Bill da Butcher, while in rehab. Once acquainted, da Butcher began working on paintings personally meant for Keef. Keef believed that his move to Los Angeles benefited him; {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Keef stated [...] "I got away from all the unnecessary trouble. It's better out here [...] than in Chicago, because I got in <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble.</b> I like living out here. I think it improved me.

500|$|Frank Spotnitz was {{assigned}} writing duties for [...] "Nisei", which was {{originally intended to}} be a stand-alone mythology story and to air as the seventh episode of the third season. However, as Spotnitz developed his script, the episode hit several logistical snags. Most notably, Spotnitz's script featured several scenes filmed on trains: Chris Carter explained, [...] "We found {{that we were going to}} have some trouble shooting with trains." [...] Eventually, the sheer scope of the episode caused co-executive producer R. W. Goodwin <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> that he wanted to scrap the story. Spotnitz explained, [...] "Goodwin called Chris and said, 'This is unproducable. [...] you've got to throw out the script, basically.' I was devastated, and Chris [...] 'Let's make it a two-parter.'" [...] So, the episode was bumped back to number nine and was lengthened to a two parter, resulting in it being delayed several weeks.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Misery" [...] {{details the}} {{feelings}} one receives following a new relationship. Stefani sings: [...] "Hurry up, {{come see me}} / Put {{me out of my}} misery", which shows the singer debating whether she wants to relive the pain or experience the pleasure. Elsewhere, she compares her boyfriend to medications: [...] "You're like drugs to me / You're like drugs to me", and warns him that their newfound relationship is becoming a bit much: [...] "You're in <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> / Yeah, you're in so much trouble". Additionally, she requests that the lover should come visit her: [...] "You're at the door / I'm thinking things I never thought before / Like what your love would taste like / Give me more". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that Stefani's ex-husband Gavin Rossdale was not the track's subject, despite the misleading use of the word [...] "Misery".|$|E

500|$|Unable to fire {{her main}} or {{secondary}} batteries {{at the three}} destroyers causing her <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble,</b> Hiei instead concentrated on SanFrancisco, which was passing by only [...] away. Along with Kirishima, Inazuma, and Ikazuchi, the four ships made repeated hits on SanFrancisco, disabling her steering control and killing Admiral Callaghan, Captain Cassin Young, {{and most of the}} bridge staff. The first few salvos from Hiei and Kirishima consisted of the special fragmentation bombardment shells, which reduced damage to the interior of SanFrancisco and may have saved her from being sunk outright. Not expecting a ship-to-ship confrontation, it took the crews of the two enemy battleships several minutes to switch to armor-piercing ammunition, and SanFrancisco, almost helpless to defend herself, managed to momentarily sail clear of the melee. She had landed at least one shell in Hieis steering gear room during the exchange, flooding it with water, shorting out her power steering generators, and severely inhibiting Hieis steering capability. Helena followed SanFrancisco to try to protect her from further harm.|$|E
500|$|At {{no time in}} {{his life}} did Mercator claim to be a Lutheran but there are many hints that he had sympathies in that direction. As a child, called Geert, he was {{surrounded}} by adults who were possibly followers of Geert Groote, who placed meditation, contemplation and biblical study over ritual and liturgy—and who also founded the school of the Brethren of the Common Life at 's-Hertogenbosch. As an adult Mercator had family connections to Molanus, a religious reformer who would later have to flee Leuven. Also he was a close friend and correspondent of Philip Melanchthon, one of the principal Lutheran reformers. Study of the bible was something that was central to Mercator's life and it was the cause of the early philosophical doubts that caused him <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> during his student days, doubts which some of his teachers would have considered to be tantamount to heresy. His visits to the free thinking Franciscans in Mechelen may have attracted the attention of the theologians at the university, amongst whom were two senior figures of the Inquisition, Jacobus Latomus and Ruard Tapper. The words of the latter on the death of heretics convey the atmosphere of that time: ...|$|E
500|$|Lasance {{explained}} that {{a common theme}} in Aden's life is something bad happening just after each time he rebuilds his life. One such bad event is the re-emergence of his alcoholic father, Larry. His arrival sets Aden [...] "on the back foot" [...] again, as most of Aden's childhood issues stemmed from his father's addiction to alcohol. He also {{explained that}} alcohol abuse is often seen in victims of abuse, so Aden is angered when Larry admits Aden's grandfather abused him too. [...] "Aden loses it" [...] with Larry, because he has had his last chance in Aden's view. Aden holds his father hostage and withdraws his medication to punish him. Aden has had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> from Larry that those [...] "experiences have made him {{the way he is}} now", and the story comes to a culmination with Aden giving up on his father. Aden is admitted into psychiatric care after the incident. However he initially makes little progress and prefers to help fellow patient Melody Jones (Celeste Dodwell) with her treatment. Lasance said that Aden had been [...] "protective of Melody after Axel Hay (Trent Dalzell) took advantage of her." [...] The pair share an [...] "unspoken bond" [...] because of their past experiences and he [...] "understands exactly what she's going through." ...|$|E

500|$|When older Neighbours viewers {{expressed}} their concern {{about a young}} unwed couple moving in together, producers decided to have them marry instead. On-screen, neither family approved of Scott and Charlene's plan to move in together, but when Scott learned his father was only 18 when he got married, Scott found the solution to their problem and asked Charlene to marry him. Minogue said Charlene was shocked at first, but she became [...] "very excited" [...] {{about the idea of}} getting married. She continued, [...] "She knows they want to live together and they have had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> getting their parents' approval that I suppose getting married seems the logical thing to do. They will be together anyway, so they may as well finalise it." [...] After getting over her initial shock, Madge gave the couple her blessing to get married. Minogue and Donovan both agreed that they would not get married so young, and Donovan thought that younger couples should live together first. He also believed that Scott was rushing into things. Scott and Charlene were married during [...] "Episode 523", which was first broadcast on 1 July 1987 to two million Australian viewers. The episode became [...] "a TV phenomenon" [...] and Minogue said it was what Scott and Charlene's romance had been building up to.|$|E
