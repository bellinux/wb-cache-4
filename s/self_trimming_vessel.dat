40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors {{investigate}} {{the problems of}} predicting the fuel consumption and of providing the best value for the <b>trim</b> of a <b>vessel</b> in real operations based on data measured by the onboard automation systems. Three different approaches for the prediction of the fuel consumption are compared: White, Black and Gray Box Models. White Box Models (WBM) {{are based on the}} knowledge of the physical underling processes. Black Box Models (BBMs) build upon statistical inference procedures based on the historical data collection. Finally, the authors propose two different Gray Box Model (GBM) which are able to exploit both mechanistic knowledge of the underlying physical principles and available measurements. Based on these predictive models of the fuel consumption a new strategy for the optimisation of the <b>trim</b> of a <b>vessel</b> is proposed. Results on real world operational data show that the BBM is able to remarkably improve a state-of-the-art WBM, while the GBM is able to encapsulate the a-priory knowledge of the WBM into the BBM so to achieve the same performance of the latter but requiring less historical data. Moreover, results show that the GBM can be used as an effective tool for optimising the <b>trim</b> of a <b>vessel</b> in real operational conditions...|$|R
50|$|The ship's launch {{set a new}} world's {{record for}} rapid construction. The ship, and sister , were built on the {{patented}} Isherwood System of longitudinal framing with propulsion machinery in the stern. Cargo space was provided by six large, <b>self</b> <b>trimming,</b> coal holds for 2,248 ST of coal and four deep tanks forward under the lower deck combined with tanks in the inner bottom under the holds for 772,400 gal L of oil cargo. The coal holds had two hatches each, except for the one hatch for the forward hold, and the contract requirement was for each hatch being able to handle 100 ST per hour which was met in the official test by a figure of 137.5 ST per hour. An advantage of the Isherwood framing was a weight saving that allowed Orion to carry the specified deadweight on a draft of 26 ft instead of the contracted draft at that load of 27 ft allowing for an increase of 500 ST of coal at specified draft. Propulsion was by two triple expansion steam engines with cylinders of 27 in, 46 in and 76 in diameter and a 48 in stroke with steam from three double ended Scotch boilers driving two 16 ft three bladed propellers with 18 ft mean pitch with average trial speed of 14.468 kn achieved.|$|R

60|$|The skipper {{was so far}} right.

He had scarcely made the remark, when I was half stunned by a shock under my feet, which seemed to rend the yacht asunder. There followed a terrific report, and the deck was instantly deluged with water. There could be no doubt what had occurred. We had touched a torpedo, and the yacht was already sinking.

But Varney was as bold-faced and ready-witted as he was cunning and unscrupulous--a skilful pilot in extremity, and fully conscious of the advantages which he would obtain could he extricate Leicester from his present peril, and of the ruin that yawned for himself should he fail in doing so.|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{efficiency}} {{is an important}} factor for the shipping industry both regarding new build vessels and existing vessels. A method to reduce the fuel consumption of existing vessels operating in off design conditions is to <b>trim</b> a <b>vessel</b> in the most optimum trim condition. The current approach to determine the most efficient trim condition is to perform propulsion tests under different trim conditions in a towing tank. To determine the usability of the CFD program PARNASSOS a trim variation study is performed on a vessel that is already tested in one of the tanks of MARIN. The trend of the propulsion from the tank tests is used to validate the trend of the resistance from the CFD calculations. Before validating the trend of the resistance with the trend of the propulsion it was checked whether or not the change of the resistance is dominant over the change in propulsive efficiency. It turned out that the change of the resistance is dominant over the change of the propulsive efficiency and therefore the trend of the propulsive power can be used to validate the trend of the resistance. The uncertainty of the CFD calculations is determined using a grid refinement study according to the method developed by Luis Eça and Martin Hoekstra [Eça andHoekstra, 2014]. According to this method the uncertainty of the performed calculations is estimated at 3. 5 %. The uncertainty of the tank tests is estimated at 0. 9 % according to Martijn van Rijsbergen [van Rijsbergen, 2014]. Unfortunately the uncertainty value obtained using the current method for estimating the uncertainty is not small enough to validate the trend of the resistance with the trend of the propulsion from the towing tank tests. The fact that the uncertainty determined is not small enough to validate the trend obtained from the CFD calculations doesn’t necessarily invalidate the assumption that the results of the CFD calculations are correct. It is expected that the uncertainty of the difference is smaller than the relative uncertainty, an expectation that is supported {{by the fact that the}} fits of the power series estimation for the resistance coefficients of the even keel condition and the 1. 5 m aft trim condition show the same trend and the two fits do not cross each other. There are at least two ways to further reduce the estimate of the uncertainty. The first one is to use finer grids. The second one is to further optimize the method to determine the uncertainty of these CFD calculations and reduce the influence of data scatter and non-similarity of the grids on the estimate of the uncertainty. The results of the CFD calculations are analyzed as if the data is validated. <b>Trimming</b> the <b>vessel</b> aft resulted in an increase of the total resistance. <b>Trimming</b> the <b>vessel</b> forward reduced the total resistance. The total resistance, the frictional resistance and the hydrodynamic pressure resistance increase when the <b>vessel</b> is <b>trimmed</b> aft while the hydrostatic pressure resistance reduces. These results show that the change in frictional resistance and the hydrodynamic pressure resistance are dominant over the change in hydrostatic pressure resistance. For moderate changes of trim the change in wetted surface is dominant over the change of shear stress regarding the change in frictional resistance. For extreme changes in trim the cause of the increase of the frictional resistance is a sheet vortex developing at the bow of the vessel and running aft along the bilge of the vessel. This sheet vortex influences the local thickness of the boundary layer and therefore influences the local shear stress. At the transom of the vessel the local hydrodynamic pressure resistance is reduced caused by the submergence of the transom. <b>Trimming</b> the <b>vessel</b> aft reduced the pressure recovery at the stern of the vessel, which has a negative influence on the local hydrodynamic pressure resistance. At the forward shoulder of the vessel the hydrodynamic pressure resistance increases as well when the <b>vessel</b> is <b>trimmed</b> aft. <b>Trimming</b> the <b>vessel</b> aft resulted in an increase of the hydrodynamic pressure resistance, which shows that the effect of the pressure recovery at the stern of the vessel and the increase of hydrodynamic pressure at the forward shoulder of the vessel are dominant over the effect of the presence of a dead water zone behind the transom of the vessel.

But by and by, when they had got fairly out to sea, there came a stiff breeze from the north-west, and drove them along as merrily over the white-capped waves {{as if they had been}} going on the most delightful errand imaginable. And though it was a sad business enough, I rather question whether fourteen young people, without any old persons to keep them in order, could continue to spend the whole time of the voyage in being miserable. There had been some few dances upon the undulating deck, I suspect, and some hearty bursts of laughter, and other such unseasonable merriment among the victims, before the high blue mountains of Crete began to show themselves among the far-off clouds. That sight, to be sure, made them all very grave again.|$|R
60|$|Austin {{accordingly}} busied {{himself with}} his papers, {{and it was an}} hour later when he went on deck. The Estremedura had gone to sea by then, and the lights of the little Spanish town blinked above the broad fringe of surf astern. High above her the great black cordillera cut hard and sharp against the luminous blueness of the night, and the long heave of the Atlantic flashed, white-topped, beneath the moon ahead. She swung over it with slanted spars and swaying funnel, while the keen trade-breeze sang in her rigging, and now and then a flying-fish ricocheted, gleaming, from sea-top to sea-top beneath her side. She was very well kept above decks, a <b>trim,</b> yacht-like <b>vessel,</b> and for a while Austin leaned over her quarter-rails, smoking a cigarette, and wondering when Miss Jacinta Brown would come up on deck. There was a very deaf Englishman, who insisted on conversing with him in stentorian tones in the saloon, and he had no desire for his company. In the meanwhile, it was pleasant to lounge there and watch the moonlight gleam upon the tumbling seas.|$|R
