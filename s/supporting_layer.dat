The epithelial cells proliferate and crowding results in a pseudo-multilayer appearance.

The latter can be demonstrated with special staining techniques (immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins) to identify the basal cells forming the <b>supporting</b> <b>layer</b> of the acinus. In prostate cancer, the abnormal cells spread beyond the boundaries of the acinus and form clusters without basal cells. In HGPIN, the basal cell layer is disrupted but present.

40|$|Recently forward osmosis (FO) has {{attracted}} growing attention on many potential {{applications such as}} wastewater treatment, desalination and power generation. FO performance is primarily limited {{by the presence of}} internal concentration polarization (ICP), which significantly reduces the permeate flux. This study explores the relationship between the physicochemical properties of the solution against the membrane <b>support</b> <b>layer</b> and ICP by incorporating constrictivity. Four solutions with different diffusivities, ion/molecule sizes and viscosities were systematically investigated using a bench-scale FO system. It is found that ICP in the <b>support</b> <b>layer</b> is strongly dependent on the physicochemical properties of the solution facing the <b>support</b> <b>layer.</b> When the solution against the membrane <b>support</b> <b>layer</b> has a lower aqueous diffusivity but larger ion/molecule size and higher viscosity, The ICP phenomenon will be more severe, resulting in lower water flux. The identical diffusion direction of the feed solute and the water flux may reduce the effective diffusivity of the solute in the <b>support</b> <b>layer</b> when the feed solution facing the membrane <b>support</b> <b>layer,</b> resulting in high concentrative ICP.

40|$|Wedge shaped blocks (WSB) are {{attracting}} increasing {{attention as}} protection against overtopping for earth and rock-fill dams. However, there are limited examples of application and {{some aspects of}} the technology merit additional research and improvement. One key issue is the design of drainage and <b>supporting</b> <b>layer</b> for WSB protections. During overtopping, part of the overflow leaks through the joints between blocks, hence circulating through the granular material. The permeability and thickness of the <b>supporting</b> <b>layer</b> must be sufficient to prevent the flow from generating pressure on the bottom side of the blocks, which contributes to its destabilization.
