5|$|The greater melampitta is {{reported}} to be very shy and wary, but also inquisitive and may approach people <b>sitting</b> <b>quietly</b> to investigate. It is usually revealed by its calls, and can be very difficult to locate if it is not calling.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{responsible}} for more snakebite fatalities than any other African snake. This {{is due to a}} combination of factors, including its wide distribution, common occurrence, large size, potent venom that is produced in large amounts, long fangs, their habit of basking by footpaths and <b>sitting</b> <b>quietly</b> when approached.|$|E
5|$|As {{the elder}} sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection, but spares no {{opportunity}} to tease him. Together, they share the simple joys of life: <b>sitting</b> <b>quietly</b> under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's bioscope, running after the candy man who passes through the village, and watching a jatra (folk theatre) performed by a troupe of actors. Every evening they are delighted {{by the sound of}} a distant train's whistle. One day, they run away from home {{to catch a glimpse of}} the train, only to discover Indir lying dead on their return.|$|E

25|$|From {{the age of}} seven, Nadia Boulanger studied hard in {{preparation}} for her Conservatoire entrance exams, sitting in on their classes and having private lessons with its teachers. Lili often stayed in the room for these lessons, <b>sitting</b> <b>quietly</b> and listening.|$|E
25|$|Many {{survivors}} found {{a temporary}} haven in the First Precinct station house. After a Brooklyn Eagle reporter found her dazed near the Washington Street entrance, Kate Claxton was taken there. Dressed only in thin theatrical garb, she {{huddled in the}} station house. The enormous disaster would occur to her only in small, incongruous pieces. <b>Sitting</b> <b>quietly</b> in Captain Smith's office, she would suddenly mourn for some lost article of clothing, her seal skin sacque or jewelry. Later on, the thought that {{she had lost her}} purse and was penniless would haunt her. From time to time people would enter and she would ask them about H. S. Murdoch, the actor who had been on stage with her during her final minutes inside and who had rushed to his dressing room for outerwear. No one had seen him; she would beseech the person to go look for him. Eventually a waterproof cloak was found for her and she was driven to her rooms at Pierrepoint House.|$|E
500|$|The Oliviers' {{marriage}} was disintegrating {{during the late}} 1950s. While directing Charlton Heston in the 1960 play The Tumbler, Olivier divulged that [...] "Vivien is several thousand miles away, trembling {{on the edge of}} a cliff, even when she's <b>sitting</b> <b>quietly</b> in her own drawing room", at a time when she was threatening suicide. In May 1960 divorce proceedings started; Leigh reported the fact to the press and informed reporters of Olivier's relationship with Plowright. The decree nisi was issued in December 1960, which enabled him to marry Plowright in March 1961. A son, Richard, was born in December 1961; two daughters followed, Tamsin Agnes Margaret—born in January 1963—and Julie-Kate, born in July 1966.|$|E

500|$|The album artwork for Mediocre {{meant to}} emulate the theme of mediocrity. Sariñana elaborated, [...] "The cover is a take {{on the idea that}} women in the ‘40s and ‘50s had to be ‘perfect.’ Perfect hair, perfect clothes, <b>sitting</b> <b>quietly</b> and making perfect meals and {{embroidering}} perfectly. And, ironically, they were all perfect in the same, uninteresting way so that ended up making them all mediocre. That was the idea." [...] Sariñana stressed that she did not intend to produce mediocre content for the album: [...] "It’s {{not to say that the}} material is mediocre, but rather that it’s a message of irony, and I think the public gets that, but there are some people out there who like to poke fun at the title." ...|$|E
500|$|The ways {{in which}} St Vincent chose to {{communicate}} the rejections often depended {{on the number of}} letters, the individual concerned, or the demands made by their respective well wishers. To the Earl of Portsmouth he wrote: [...] "I cannot possibly agree in opinion with your Lordship, that a person <b>sitting</b> <b>quietly</b> by his fireside, and enjoying very nearly a sinecure, during such a war as we have been engaged in, has the same pretensions to promotion with the man who has exposed his person, and hazarded his constitution in every clime." [...] A harsh rebuff to a peer of the realm. Yet to a lady of no discernible rank or influence he wrote: [...] "Although I cannot admit the force of your argument in favour of Captain (name unknown) , there is something so amiable and laudable in a sister contending for the promotion of her brother that no apology was necessary for your letter of the 24th, which I lose no time in acknowledging;" ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{the closure}} of Dunn's {{facility}} in 2004, Bubbles has been kept at the Center for Great Apes in Wauchula, Florida, where {{he is said to}} enjoy painting and listening to flute music. The center for apes, where the annual care for each animal costs around $17,000 as of 2009, also houses 41 other chimpanzees and orangutans. Patti Ragan, director for the Center for Great Apes, commented on the animals' daily routine at the sanctuary. [...] "They relax. They take naps together. They might go up {{in the top of the}} cupola. They go out in the chutes and lie under a tree in the tunnel system. They groom each other and they fight and they have arguments, too." [...] According to animal keepers at the center, the 160pound (73kg) Bubbles—whose facial features have changed since his time with Jackson—is now [...] "huge and ugly" [...] but has a [...] "sweet character". The ape now spends most of his time <b>sitting</b> <b>quietly</b> in trees with his best friend Sam, a 40-year-old chimpanzee.|$|E

5000|$|After {{filming the}} scene where Fred dies, Whedon, Acker, and Denisof [...] "went out for drinks and ended up just <b>sitting</b> around <b>quietly,</b> {{exhausted}} from the day's events". Whedon would later use this moment as inspiration for the post-credits scene in The Avengers in which the Avengers silently eat in a shawarma restaurant after the film's climactic battle.|$|R
500|$|On 28 July 1937, at {{the evening}} performance, Davidson gave his usual speech before {{entering}} the cage in which two lions, Freddie and Toto, were <b>sitting</b> <b>quietly.</b> Then, according to Blythe: [...] "in scarcely credible terms, the little clergyman from Norfolk and the lion acted out the classical Christian martyrdom to the full". Eyewitnesses later reported that after Davidson had cracked his whip and shouted, Freddie became agitated and knocked Davidson over, before seizing him by the neck and running with him around the cage. Somner struggled to pacify the snarling Freddie, who eventually dropped the unconscious Davidson, enabling her to drag him to safety; he was badly gashed, and had suffered a broken bone in his neck. [...] An uncorroborated story circulated that {{while waiting for the}} ambulance, Davidson asked that the London newspapers be alerted in time for next day's first editions. According to some press reports he sat up in hospital and asked visitors for their impressions of his ordeal in the cage. Most historians of the affair, however, believe that Davidson never recovered consciousness. He died on 30 July, his death possibly hastened by an insulin injection administered by a doctor who believed that Davidson was a diabetic. The coroner's verdict was death by misadventure.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} first covered by Welsh {{alternative}} metal band Lostprophets, recorded in a BBC Radio One session. It {{appears as a}} b-side of the single Last Train Home, released in 2004.

American indie pop duo Jack and White covered the song on their 2012 extended play Undercover. Recording artist Kelly Clarkson covered the song on September 1, 2012, as a fan request during her 2012 Summer Tour with The Fray. Alternative rock band Coldplay revealed that the single was an inspiration for the drumbeat of their song [...] "Lost!". In January 2013, American singer Selena Gomez performed an acoustic version of [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] at the UNICEF charity concert in New York City.

2500|$|Bryce then {{ordered the}} arrest of Te Whiti, Tohu and Hiroki, a Waikato Māori who had sought refuge at Parihaka after killing a cook {{travelling}} with a survey party in south Taranaki in late 1878.

60|$|We {{will not}} speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities here; how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his {{undivided}} attention to beefsteaks, done rare.

You have a pint or two of Guinness with a slim volume of Yeats, not eight mates and a 19 pint bender which ends in tattoos, A [...] and herpes from a hen party." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1925, Kirchner became {{close friends}} with fellow artist, Albert Müller and his family. Rot-Blau, a new art {{group based in}} Basle, was formed by Hermann Scherer, Albert Müller, Paul Camenisch and Hans Schiess, who all visited Kirchner and worked under his guidance. At the end of 1925, Kirchner {{returned}} to Germany and made his rounds to Frankfurt, Chemnitz (where he mother was living), and Berlin where he met with Karl Schmidt-Rottluff who wanted Kirchner {{to form a new}} artist's group; Kirchner politely refused. He then returned to Frauenkirch and wrote to Dr. Hageman on 26 March 1926: [...] "Now I’m <b>sitting</b> <b>quietly</b> at home again and I’m happy {{to be able to work}} undisturbed. I made a lot of sketches of life in Germany and it was very intriguing to see life there. I was also glad to see the old pictures of Rembrandt, Dürer, etc. again and to have the confirmation and encouragement they gave me. As for the moderns, I saw damned little that gripped me". In December 1926, Kirchner's close friend, Albert Müller, died of typhus along with his wife, Anni Müller. In 1927, Kirchner organized a memorial exhibition for Albert Müller at the Kunsthalle Basel. There was a major exhibition of Kirchner's work at the schoolhouse in Davos; the reviews were positive.|$|E
