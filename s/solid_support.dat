5|$|In {{solid-phase}} synthesis, an oligonucleotide being assembled is covalently bound, via its 3'-terminal hydroxy group, to a <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> {{material and}} remains {{attached to it}} over the entire course of the chain assembly. The <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> is contained in columns whose dimensions depend {{on the scale of}} synthesis and may vary between 0.05mL and several liters. The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized on small scale ranging from 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis where the <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> is contained in the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method of choice for parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides on small scale. At the end of the chain assembly, the oligonucleotide is released from the <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E
5|$|Universal supports. In a more recent, more convenient, {{and more}} widely used method, the {{synthesis}} {{starts with the}} universal support where a non-nucleosidic linker {{is attached to the}} <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> material (compounds 1 and 2). A phosphoramidite respective to the 3'-terminal nucleoside residue is coupled to the universal <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> in the first synthetic cycle of oligonucleotide chain assembly using the standard protocols. The chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which the solid support-bound oligonucleotide is deprotected. The characteristic feature of the universal solid supports is that the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal nucleotide residue to the universal linker as shown in Scheme 6. The critical advantage of this approach is that the same <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> is used irrespectively of the sequence of the oligonucleotide to be synthesized. For the complete removal of the linker and the 3'-terminal phosphate from the assembled oligonucleotide, the <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> 1 and several similar solid supports require gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, or their mixture and are commercially available. The <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> 2 requires a solution of ammonia in anhydrous methanol and is also commercially available.|$|E
5|$|At {{the current}} time, the most-adopted method is an {{automated}} synthesis on a <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> (e.g., polystyrene beads), using protecting groups (e.g., Fmoc and t-Boc) and activating groups (e.g., DCC and DIC).|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{investigation}} of ion translocating membrane proteins is presented. Protein containing membrane fragments or vesicles are adsorbed to a <b>solid</b> <b>supported</b> membrane. The <b>solid</b> <b>supported</b> membrane consists of a lipid monolayer on a gold evaporated or gold sputtered glass substrate which is coated with a long chained mercaptan (CH 3 (CH 2) mSH, m = 15, 17). Specific conductance and specific capacitance of the <b>solid</b> <b>supported</b> membrane are {{comparable to those of}} a black lipid membrane. However, the <b>solid</b> <b>supported</b> membrane has the advantage of a much higher mechanical stability. The electrical activity of bacteriorhodopsin, Na,K-ATPase, H,K-ATPase, and Ca-ATPase on the <b>solid</b> <b>supported</b> membrane is measured and compared to signals obtained on a conventionally prepared black lipid membrane. It is shown that both methods yield similar results. The <b>solid</b> <b>supported</b> membrane therefore represents an alternative method {{for the investigation}} of electrical properties of ion translocating transmembrane proteins...|$|R
40|$|A {{solution}} phase synthesis {{method for}} preparing an oligonucleotide, wherein {{at least some}} of the reagents are <b>solid</b> <b>supported.</b> The method suitable for large- scale synthesis comprises coupling a protected compound with a nucleotide derivative having a protection group in the presence of a <b>solid</b> <b>supported</b> activator to give an elongated oligonucleotide with a P(III) -internucleotide bond; optionally processing the elongated oligonucleotide by capping by reaction with a <b>solid</b> <b>supported</b> capping agent and/or by oxidizing or sulfurizing by reaction of the oligonucleotide with a <b>solid</b> <b>supported</b> oxidizing or sulfurization reagent, and removing the protection group. The coupling may include reacting and 3 '-protected compound of formula: with a nucleotide derivative having a 5 '-protection group, or reacting a 5 '-protected compound of formul...|$|R

5|$|Nucleosidic solid supports. In a {{historically}} first and still popular approach, the 3'-hydroxy {{group of the}} 3'-terminal nucleoside residue {{is attached to the}} <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> via, most often, 3’-O-succinyl arm as in compound 3. The oligonucleotide chain assembly starts with the coupling of a phosphoramidite building block respective to the nucleotide residue second from the 3’-terminus. The 3’-terminal hydroxy group in oligonucleotides synthesized on nucleosidic solid supports is deprotected under the conditions somewhat milder than those applicable for universal solid supports. However, the fact that a nucleosidic <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> has to be selected in a sequence-specific manner reduces the throughput of the entire synthetic process and increases the likelihood of human error.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> {{material}} suitable for oligonucleotide synthesis, non-nucleosidic linkers or nucleoside succinates are covalently {{attached to the}} reactive amino groups in aminopropyl CPG, LCAA CPG, or aminomethyl MPPS. The remaining unreacted amino groups are capped with acetic anhydride. Typically, three conceptually different groups of solid supports are used.|$|E
5|$|Richard Bowers' master's thesis (2012), updated to book form by Bowers and Moffett (2012), {{asserts that}} NVC has been absent from {{academic}} programs {{due to a}} lack of research into the theoretical basis for the model and lack of research on the reliability of positive results. Bowers' thesis meets the first objection through an analysis of existing theories which provide <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> for each element of the NVC (mediation) model. Without this theoretical understanding, it would not be clear what aspects of the NVC model make it work or even if it can be effectively applied by anyone other than Marshall Rosenberg. This theoretical analysis can provide a foundation for further empirical research on the effectiveness and reliability of the model.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{conventional}} solution-phase Chemical Cleavage of Mismatch (CCM) {{method is}} time-consuming, as the protocol requires purification of DNA after each reaction step. This paper describes {{a new version}} of CCM to overcome this problem by immobilizing DNA on silica <b>solid</b> <b>supports.</b> Results DNA test samples were loaded on to silica beads and the DNA bound to the <b>solid</b> <b>supports</b> underwent chemical modification reactions with KMnO 4 (potassium permanganate) and hydroxylamine in 3 M TEAC (tetraethylammonium chloride) solution. The resulting modified DNA was then simultaneously cleaved by piperidine and removed from the <b>solid</b> <b>supports</b> to afford DNA fragments without the requirement of DNA purification between reaction steps.

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS, see below) {{does not involve}} the oxidation with I2/water, and, respectively, does not suffer from the side reaction described above. On the other hand, if the capping step is performed prior to sulfurization, the <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> may contain the residual acetic anhydride and N-methylimidazole left after the capping step. The capping mixture interferes with the sulfur transfer reaction, which results in the extensive formation of the phosphate triester internucleosidic linkages {{in place of the}} desired PS triesters. Therefore, for the {{synthesis of}} OPS, it is advisable to conduct the sulfurization step prior to the capping step.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving as}} a county judge, Truman wanted to run for Governor or Congress, but Pendergast {{rejected}} these ideas. Truman then thought he might serve out his career in some well-paying county sinecure, but circumstances changed when Pendergast reluctantly backed him in the 1934 Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate after four other potential candidates turned him down. In the primary, Truman defeated Congressmen John J. Cochran and Jacob L. Milligan with the <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> of Jackson County, which was crucial to his candidacy, as were the contacts he had made statewide as a county official, Mason, military reservist, {{and member of the}} American Legion. In the general election, Truman defeated incumbent Republican Roscoe C. Patterson by nearly 20 percentage points as part of a continuing wave of pro-New Deal Democrats elected in response to the Great Depression.|$|E

In joint debates across the state, McCreary stressed what many Kentuckians felt were abuses of power by Republican President Ulysses S. Grant during the Reconstruction Era. Harlan countered by faulting the state's Democratic politicians for continuing to dwell on war issues almost a decade after the war's end. He also attacked what he perceived as Democratic financial extravagance and the high number of pardons granted by sitting Democratic governor Preston Leslie. Harlan claimed these as evidence of widespread corruption in the Democratic Party. McCreary received <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> from the state's newspapers, nearly all of which had Democratic sympathies. Despite a late infusion of cash and stump speakers in favor of his opponent, McCreary won the general election by a vote of 130,026 to 94,236.|$|E

5|$|The {{obvious choice}} for a supreme {{commander}} in the Pacific was General Douglas MacArthur.

MacArthur had <b>solid</b> <b>support</b> from the President, the Army and the American people, but not the Navy. The Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest King, saw the Pacific lines of communication primarily as a naval responsibility and would not yield command to an Army officer and proposed a division placing all of the Solomons within the Australian area, but excluding the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, and New Zealand. While the Army planners, led by Brigadier General Dwight Eisenhower, were willing to compromise on a divided command, they objected to placing Australia and New Zealand in separate theatres. The Joint Chiefs of Staff discussed the matter between 9 and 16 March, the result {{of which was a}} decision to adopt the Navy's plan, with only minor amendments.|$|E
