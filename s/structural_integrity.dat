5|$|Later, {{the rains}} caused the worst {{flooding}} in over 20years in Swaziland, which {{damaged or destroyed}} more than 100bridges. Disrupted transport left areas isolated for several days. In South Africa, rainfall peaked at 950mm (37in), which flooded 29river basins, notably the Pongola River which altered its course after the storm. Flooding caused the Pongolapoort Dam to reach 87% of its capacity; when waters were released to maintain the <b>structural</b> <b>integrity,</b> additional flooding occurred in Mozambique, forcing thousands to evacuate. Throughout the region, Domoina caused widespread flooding that damaged houses, roads, and crops, leaving about $199million in damage. There were 242deaths in southeastern Africa.|$|E

30|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{impedance test}} was also measured {{to examine the}} kinetic process. In Fig. S 7 a–c, the electrochemical impendence spectra of Bi@NC, bare Bi, and Bi@C half-cells are presented. The semicircle’s diameter stands for charge-transfer resistance. Although the Bi@NC half-cells had larger internal resistance {{than the other two}} in the initial stage, its rate of increase in resistance is slower, which can be clearly observed in Fig. S 7 d. This is attributed to the differences in the structures of Bi@NC, bare Bi, and Bi@C. In Bi@NC, the Bi nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in the carbon matrix and most maintain their <b>structural</b> <b>integrities</b> with few SEI layers on the surface after cycling (Fig. S 5 a, b). In bare Bi and Bi@C, the pulverization of Bi nanoparticles and continuous growth of SEI layers on Bi particle surfaces result in fast growth of resistance.|$|R

5|$|Over time, {{numerous}} structural modifications {{were made}} to suit the needs of tenants in the Twin Towers. Modifications were made {{in accordance with the}} Port Authority's Tenant Alteration Review Manual and were reviewed by the Port Authority to ensure the changes did not compromise <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> of the buildings. In many instances, openings were cut in the floors to accommodate new stairways to connect tenant floors. Some steel beams in the core were reinforced and strengthened to accommodate heavy live loads, such as large amounts of heavy files that tenants had on their floors.|$|E
5|$|The dam and reservoir, {{along with}} other {{treatment}} structures built at and below the mine, have successfully reduced the dry weather pollution of Spring Creek by up to ninety-five percent. Problems, though, still occur mainly {{in the form of}} large uncontrolled spills from the reservoir. Several concerns about the <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> and safety of the dam, both physically and biologically, arose in the 1990s. Emergency releases from Shasta Lake, often in the value of thousands of acre feet of water, have occurred {{from time to time to}} dilute massive acid spills from the Spring Creek drainage.|$|E
5|$|The {{normal force}} {{is due to}} repulsive forces of {{interaction}} between atoms at close contact. When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects. The normal force, for example, {{is responsible for the}} <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMost of {{in-service}} welded built-up structures, {{which contain}} many welded joints as fatigue crack initiation sites, {{are subjected to}} many types of loading and these loadings have different axial components with different phases. However, the <b>structural</b> <b>integrities</b> are evaluated according to design codes based on theoretical and experimental investigations under a uniaxial loading condition. Most of these codes {{are based on the}} S-N curves approach. On the other hand, authors proposed the numerical simulation method of fatigue crack propagation histories of a cracked plate subjected biaxial loadings with phase difference of each loading component. Fracture mechanics approach is applied to establish our method. In this study, fatigue crack growth behaviour of an out-of-plane gusset welded joint under biaxial loading with two different phase conditions were investigated. The phase difference effect for fatigue crack shape evolution under biaxial loading was confirmed by measured ones. Besides, comparisons of measured crack evolution with the numerical simulation results were performed to validate of our fatigue crack growth simulation for welded joints...|$|R

40|$|Membrane {{proteins}} {{are notoriously}} challenging to analyze using mass spectrometry (MS) {{because of their}} insolubility in aqueous solution. Current MS methods for studying intact membrane proteins involve solubilization in detergent. However, detergents can destabilize proteins, leading to protein unfolding and aggregation, or resulting in inactive entities. Amphipathic polymers, termed amphipols, {{can be used as}} a substitute for detergents and have been shown to enhance the stability of membrane proteins. Here, we show the utility of amphipols for investigating the structural and functional properties of membrane proteins using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The functional properties of two bacterial outer-membrane β-barrel proteins, OmpT and PagP, in complex with the amphipol A 8 - 35 are demonstrated, and their <b>structural</b> <b>integrities</b> are confirmed in the gas phase using ESI-MS coupled with ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). The data illustrate the power of ESI-IMS-MS in separating distinct populations of amphipathic polymers from the amphipol-membrane complex while maintaining a conformationally "nativelike" membrane protein structure in the gas phase. Together, the data indicate the potential importance and utility of amphipols for the analysis of membrane proteins using MS...|$|R

The North Tower collapsed at 10:28a.m. after burning for 102minutes. When the North Tower collapsed, debris fell on the nearby 7 World Trade Center building (7WTC), damaging it and starting fires.

5|$|An {{estimated}} 5,000 {{buildings were}} damaged beyond repair. In the Qazvin province, 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage. In the neighboring Hamadan province, 45 villages were destroyed. A {{large majority of}} houses in the region were single-story masonry buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. As non-engineered structures, these could not withstand seismic forces, with structural failure and collapse resulting from wall-to-wall separation {{and the lack of}} <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> and of a proper lateral system of resisting. Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian code of practice for seismic-resistant design fared much better.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the damages of microbial cell structures, {{as well as the}} relationships between these damages and the release of cellular organic matter in the pretreatment of waste activated sludge (WAS) by using alkaline pretreatment as model. In the alkaline pretreatment of WAS, the most damage of bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), cell walls, cell membranes, and cell nuclei occurred at pH 11. 5 - 12. 0 (46. 2 %), pH 11. 0 - 11. 5 (27. 3 %), pH 9. 0 - 10. 0 (34. 2 %), and pH 11. 5 - 12. 0 (44. 4 %), respectively. The damage percentages of these cell structures in the pH stabilization stage were low because most of the damages occurred when the pH increased. The <b>structural</b> <b>integrities</b> of sludge microorganisms were all damaged in the pH increase stage. The damages of EPS, cell walls, and cell membranes were significantly correlated with the release of cellular organic matter, and these damages were necessary to release the cellular matter in WAS.

5|$|Apoptosis is a {{controlled}} {{process in which}} the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' <b>structural</b> <b>integrity.</b> Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.|$|E
