5|$|Tavares {{has been}} praised by his coaches {{for his ability}} to {{anticipate}} the play since he joined the OHL. A lack of speed had been the most common criticism of Tavares' play, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> spent his junior career attempting to improve. Tavares' skating speed is <b>something</b> <b>he</b> greatly improved since turning professional, and his speed is no longer considered an issue on the ice.|$|E
5|$|In heavy rain, Baker {{took off}} and began to level off at 600 feet. A {{quarter of a mile}} into the flight, the engine failed. The plane was {{generally}} easy to crash-land if necessary, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> had done previously at the cost of a few broken ribs.|$|E
5|$|A farmworker heard Jeremy leave around 9:30 pm. Barbara Wilson, the farm's secretary, telephoned Nevill {{at around}} that time, and {{was left with}} the {{impression}} that she had interrupted an argument. She said he was short with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E
50|$|Sutherland has {{detailed}} his {{process as}} a director, casting extensively and immersing cast in entire worlds, <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> experienced personally as an actor.|$|R

50|$|The film {{concludes with}} Byron {{deciding}} {{to strike out}} on his own and 'do <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> proud of for a change'. He gives Holly his card and heads out.|$|R
5|$|After leaving school, Macartney {{worked for}} a fruit and {{vegetable}} merchant near Sydney's Sussex Street docks, honing his batting skills by practising without pads on a wooden wharf during his lunch break. At this stage in his career, he possessed a copybook technique and defensive style, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> was to discard for an audacious, self-styled and attacking outlook.|$|E
5|$|Cattle {{were raised}} at the farm. Eisenhower would often poke the rump of a bull with his shotgun {{to show what}} quality of steak the animal would {{eventually}} produce, alarming the Secret Service agents that were protecting him. Once, while barbecuing (<b>something</b> <b>he</b> loved {{to do on the}} farm), he made the mistake of announcing which cow he was cooking. As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, she was brought to tears.|$|E
5|$|Following graduation, {{he applied}} for a {{position}} as a medical auxiliary, but the offer required him to enroll in the Peronist Party, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> did not accept. He then moved to a small town named Jacinto Aráuz in La Pampa Province after being offered a job as the town's doctor; when the resident doctor died, he succeeded him and brought his brother Juan José into the clinic. He married María Antonia Delgado in 1951.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} kept it {{specially}} dark," [...] said Horne Fisher to himself. [...] "It must be <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> really ashamed of. Hang it all! {{what is a}} man ashamed of nowadays?" ...|$|R
30|$|My physics {{teacher was}} {{explaining}} solenoids…he’s not just saying <b>something,</b> <b>he’s</b> asking us questions {{so we can}} think about it as he’s teaching. …If we don’t get it, he can explain it further (18).|$|R
5000|$|... {{making a}} person do {{something}} embarrassing, or, for example, achieve instant orgasm, whenever <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> defined beforehand happens, like the subject hearing music, while being {{fully aware of}} what they're doing, but unable to affect it.|$|R
5|$|Marsh joined Alexander's Hippodrome Company, {{travelling}} around Australia in a sideshow, {{where his}} cricketing fame brought much attention. His activities thereafter are unclear, {{but it is}} likely that he became an itinerant worker. In retirement, Marsh drank heavily and was jailed for 14 days for committing an assault in Melbourne in 1909, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> blamed on alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Meechum remains Underwood's {{bodyguard}} once {{he becomes}} the president, and there {{does not appear to}} be any continuing sexual relationship. Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks) not to write anything that would damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's hand with a marker on one of the walls of the White House when he wants to replace a Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up <b>something</b> <b>he</b> likes instead.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{said that}} Spira {{deviates}} from {{the worlds of}} past Final Fantasy games most notably {{in the level of}} detail incorporated, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he's {{all right}} I guess," [...] replied Grayson grudgingly. [...] "A feller's {{got to be}} some good at <b>something.</b> <b>He's</b> {{probably}} one of these here paper-collar, cracker-fed college dudes thet don't know nothin' else 'cept writin' in books." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{think its}} only <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> {{got in his}} head." [...] said Mrs. Cohen the younger. [...] "He's been turning over writing continually, and when I speak to him it takes him ever so long to hear and answer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Critics praised Ivan Bunin's traveler's sketches, {{seeing them}} as an {{integral}} and highly important part of his legacy. Bunin's [...] "longing for the ceaseless, unrelenting wandering" [...] and his [...] "insatiable perceptiveness" [...] (as he himself put it, in the foreword to The Scream, 1921 Paris compilation) was <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> been long obsessed with. Later scholars saw {{it as part of}} his artistic philosophy, aiming at [...] "the understanding of all times and peoples' tribulations." [...] In his [...] "Liberation of Tolstoy" [...] essay Bunin wrote about some artists' ability to [...] "feel other times... better than that of their own" [...] and, critics argued, this [...] "transformational" [...] quality was <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> made very much of his own.|$|R
5|$|The most noted of Bauer's {{pictures}} are his watercolors, the technique he used when illustrating for books and magazines; he alternated between aquarelle and gouache. When he created illustrations the two mediums were sometimes mixed, since he needed both {{the speed of}} the aquarelle and the contrast and impasto that the gouache provided. These water-soluble, and fast drying, media allowed Bauer to work on his pictures until the last minute before deadline, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> was prone to do.|$|E
5|$|Alice and the Redfields {{board the}} Arcadia, {{discovering}} it functional but abandoned. Claire then remembers Arcadia is an Umbrella trap to get test subjects; they release the survivors, among them K-Mart (Spencer Locke). Alice follows {{a trail of}} blood deeper into the ship, where she finds Wesker. The T-virus revived him, but it battles Wesker for control, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> believes fresh human DNA can pacify; the Umbrella staff fled when he began eating test subjects. Alice's DNA is superior to his, since she retained control despite her bonding with the virus at a cellular level; Wesker believes eating her will help him regain control of his body over {{the effects of the}} T-virus.|$|E
5|$|At {{work one}} day, Esquire meets John Garnett (Keith David), a millionaire {{who heads a}} {{successful}} business venture called the United Express. The two quickly become friends, with Garnett's admiration for Esquire's ambition and Esquire's respect for Garnett's success driving the relationship. Esquire sees an opportunity to obtain the letter of recommendation that would bring about his acceptance to his primary college choice. When Esquire goes to Garnett's house {{to pick up the}} letter, he meets his daughter Erin, who, to his surprise, turns out to be New-New, whose real name is Erin. Erin says that she will reveal where Esquire is really from (<b>something</b> <b>he</b> lied to her father about) if he tells Rashad about her.|$|E
50|$|Nora {{reveals that}} Tom doesn't {{want to work}} in {{advertising}} anymore, <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> never told Lynette. Instead of confronting him about it, Lynette tells Tom maybe it's time to think about pursuing whatever dream job he gave up on a long time ago.|$|R
5000|$|... "He (being Holden, the film's narrator) {{feels like}} <b>he's</b> seeing <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> seen {{thousands}} of times before", Holden says, [...] "and in fact he has." [...] As {{a result of being}} witness to so many violent images, [...] "we grow insensitive to death and violence. It becomes devastatingly normal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{there is}} <b>something</b> that <b>he</b> has not read, <b>something</b> that <b>he</b> {{has not been}} invited to read. Let it not remain so. Tell it to him all even though {{you may have to}} support his anger, and for a time to pine in the shadow of his displeasure." ...|$|R
5|$|Baker, de Francisci, and Moore met in Washington on December 15. At that time, Baker, who {{hoped to}} start Peace dollar {{production}} in 1921, outlined the tight schedule {{for this to}} be accomplished, and requested certain design changes. Among these was the inclusion of the broken sword from the sculptor's alternate reverse design, to be placed under the eagle, on the mountaintop on which it stands, in addition to the olive branch. Baker approved the designs, subject to these changes. The revised designs were presented to President Harding on December 19. Harding insisted on the removal of a small feature of Liberty's face, which seemed to him to suggest a dimple, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> did not consider suggestive of peace, and the sculptor then did so.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was <b>something</b> <b>he</b> sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Foster enlists Homer to help Ned {{learn how}} to {{appropriately}} express emotions. After several failed scripted insults, Homer manages to get Ned to open up about some of his repressed dislikes, finally admitting he hates his parents, after which he immediately feels better. Dr. Foster declares Flanders cured and he is immediately released. Outside the hospital, Ned is greeted by the townsfolk of Springfield. Ned promises that from now on, if anyone does <b>something</b> <b>he</b> does not like, they will hear about it, which Dr. Foster tells him is very healthy.|$|E
6000|$|... "They think a rare lot of Athelny down here," [...] {{said his}} wife. [...] "Why, Mrs. Bridges said to me, I don't {{know what we}} should do without Mr. Athelny now, she said. He's always up to <b>something,</b> <b>he's</b> more like a schoolboy than the father of a family." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hart has {{mentioned}} in interviews that his songs reflect <b>something</b> <b>he's</b> lived through, and the while 2007's [...] "Cigarettes and Gasoline" [...] dealt more with rocky relationships and personal struggles, his latest release [...] "Beauty in Disrepair" [...] reflects Hart's {{picking up the}} pieces and moving on, learning, and happiness re-evolving.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing! What can I! There isn't {{anything}} to do anything about. If it's there, he knows it, and he's left it there because he didn't care what we thought. He was just trying <b>something.</b> <b>He's</b> always treated me like a perfect--child. That's all there is of it, and you know it." ...|$|R
5|$|During McCartney's {{early years}} with the Beatles, he {{primarily}} used a Höfner 500/1 bass, though in 1965, he began sporadically using a Rickenbacker 4001S for recording. While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967 he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him play more thick-sounding basslines, {{in contrast to the}} much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason. He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live.|$|E
5|$|Ford ran {{to succeed}} Mark Sanford as Governor of South Carolina in the 2010 gubernatorial election. His {{platform}} included reinstating video poker {{to the state}} to generate returns from taxes on the gaming industry {{in an effort to}} balance the state budget, <b>something</b> <b>he</b> has proposed since the late 1990s. A law Ford sponsored in 2008 to make gambling legal failed to advance; he planned a voter referendum to repeal the ban. Ford faced state senator Vincent A. Sheheen of Camden and State Superintendent of Education Jim Rex in a primary election. Sheheen's campaign has raised $33,000 as of January 2009, while Ford's campaign raised $6,000. On June 8, 2010, Ford finished in third place in the primary election with 18percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Henrik {{is married}} to Johanna Sedin; they have two sons: Valter, {{who was born in}} 2006 in Vancouver and Harry, who was born on 12 May 2010. They live {{together}} in the city's Yaletown neighbourhood, and return to Sweden during the off-season. In March 2010, Henrik and Johanna made a joint $1.5million donation, with Daniel and his wife Marinette, to the BC Children's Hospital's $200 million project for a new building; the two families requested that it be put towards a pediatric intensive-care unit and a diagnostic imaging area. Henrik commented that it was <b>something</b> <b>he</b> and his wife had wanted to do since Valter was born.|$|E
