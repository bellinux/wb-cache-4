5000|$|Friday 18 December 1896, The Ferry Manly {{struck a}} sliding blow with the collier Merksworth which {{commenced}} to promptly start sinkingBetween 1 and 2 pm yesterday the steam collier Merksworth, bound from the Wallarah Coal Company’s mine, laden with coal, was {{heading up the}} harbour making a course for Miller's Point or somewhere about there, where she usually gets orders as to what wharf or ship she is to discharge her cargo at, when she met with a disastrous collision. She had rounded Bradley's Head, and was making an inside course to pass Pinchgut. Following her came the Manly Beach Company's new steamer Manly, {{one of the fastest}} ferry steamers in the harbour, and soon after passing Bradley's these two steamers, presumably under complete control, came so close that the one hit the other what is technically known as a [...] "sliding blow" [...] That graceful act proved sufficient for the <b>struck</b> <b>ship</b> to almost immediately sink, and cause an almost miraculous escape of her crew. It would, {{in the absence of the}} official reports and the official inquiry which the Marine Board must hold, be improper to speculate as to which ship was the offender. The fact remains that the well-found steam collier the Merksworth received such injury as ended her career for the time being in her particular sphere of usefulness. The accounts given by some of those who were aboard the Merksworth differ in minor details, though they are unanimous in that they were ahead until the nose of the Manly was poked into the midship part of their ship, smashing the bridge and some of the upper works It came as a surprise, and after realising that they had been struck nobody suggested that the blow was serious until the hissing caused by the inrush of water below into the boiler room was heard, and it came in quickly, for before the Merksworth could reach Kirribilli Point she was doomed, and the best that could be done was done under the circumstances, namely, head her for the nearest land and jam her head there, thus saving risking the lives of the men The other steamer, Manly, was by that time well up tho harbour on her way to the Manly wharf “They hit us on our starboard side," [...] said one of the crew of the Merksworth, “and we didn't think there was much in it, but she has a projecting propeller head, and that must have rammed us underneath" [...] And that is the accepted theory of the cause of the sinking of the MerksworthAll were silent on the ferry-boat when official reports were asked for, but the passengers were less disposed to be reticent [...] "The thing was all done in a moment," [...] said one [...] " [...] There was some whistling and singing out, but the hit was not a loud one, and we really thought the other boat was but little damaged Imagine when, after arriving in the city, we heard that the collier had sunk We had no idea of such a. thing As to who was in the right or the wrong I should be sorry to say Naturally we were a bit scared, and there was some excitement, but nothing very, sensational [...] " [...] On being seen by a reporter, the master of the Manly declined to make a statementThe steamer Merksworth lies a little to the westward of the entrance to Mosman’s Bay Her stem is sticking a few feet above water on rock The stern is in eight fathoms on a sandy bottom A foot or so of her mizzenmast was visible yesterday afternoon, and a little more of the foremast, but the top of her funnel was at least 15ft under water A lot of boats were out in the evening to inspect the place in which the steamer sank, and, judging from the rugged formation of that part of the harbour, the idea forces itself on one's mind that it was a case of [...] "touch and go," [...] of beaching or sinking in deep waterThe water police were quickly on the scene Inspector Hyem, in reply to an inquiry, said [...] " [...] It was lucky there were no lives lost We brought ashore eight of the crew, the captain and four others remained by the wreck The men brought their baggage, and they saved the Merksworth cat, s which seemed to have been a sort of pet on board”The Manly, the new Steamer which originally was built for the now Co-operative Company and the name changed subsequent.) from Emancipator to Manly, was so little damaged that she continued her timetable service throughout the remainder of the day at the company 's office it was stated that tile damage would he covered by £5The steam collier Merksworth was once a crack steamer on this coast carrying mails and passengers. like many other well-built ships, when she became a bit old her place was taken by younger, larger, and more imposing steamers she was launched at Paisley, Scotland, 22 years ago, an iron steamer of 270 tons, 10 horsepower nominal, and is now owned by the Wallarah Coal CompanyThe prime policy on the Merksworth is held by the South British Insurance Company, with re insurances ...|$|E

The damage and deformation are widely distributed to almost side structures including inner structure. The width between outer and inner shells is very affecting the damage mode where the width below the two meters will make inner shell experience damage beyond plastic deformation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a user-friendly rapid prediction tool {{of damage to}} struck and striking vessels in a ship collision event. To do this, the so-called upper bound theorem is applied to calculate internal forces and energies of any substructure involved in the ships crushing process.

As a first step, the paper gives {{a brief description of}} the upper bound method originally developed for perpendicular collisions and recently enhanced for oblique ones. Then, the theory developed in MCOL program for large rotational ship movements is detailed. By comparing results obtained with and without MCOL, the importance of hydrodynamic effects is highlighted. Some simulation results are compared with results provided by classical nonlinear finite element calculations. Finally, by using the developed analytical tool, which mixes internal and external dynamics, different crushing scenarios including oblique collisions are investigated and the influence of some collision parameters like longitudinal and vertical impact location, impact angle, and <b>struck</b> <b>ship</b> velocity is studied...|$|E

The geometry of {{the bow of the}} striking ship is idealised such that it can be described by only few parameters, still covering with sufficient accuracy almost all existing ship bows with and without bulbs. The model for the internal mechanics of the <b>struck</b> <b>ship</b> side is based on a set of so-called super-elements. Each super-element represents an assembly of structural components and contains solutions for the structural behaviour of this assembly under deep collapse. By summing up the crushing force of each super-element, it is possible to determine the total contact load between the two involved ships. A number of parameter studies are presented where the sensitivity of the damage to the loading conditions and striking positions are illustrated. Furthermore, the difference between longitudinal and transverse bow stiffening has been examined. Transversely stiffened bows are shown to be significantly softer than longitudinally stiffened bows. Thirty collision events with five different striking vessels and six different struck vessels have been examined. The examples illustrate that the usual assumption of a rigid bow only holds true for certain categories of struck and striking vessels. 2...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMaritime {{accidents}} involving ships carrying passengers may pose {{a high risk}} with respect to human casualties. For effective risk mitigation, an insight into the process of risk escalation is needed. This requires a proactive approach {{when it comes to}} risk modelling for maritime transportation systems. Most of the existing models are based on historical data on maritime accidents, and thus they can be considered reactive instead of proactive. This paper introduces a systematic, transferable and proactive framework estimating the risk for maritime transportation systems, meeting the requirements stemming from the adopted formal definition of risk. The framework focuses on ship–ship collisions in the open sea, with a RoRo/Passenger ship (RoPax) being considered as the <b>struck</b> <b>ship.</b> First, it covers an identification of the events that follow a collision between two ships in the open sea, and, second, it evaluates the probabilities of these events, concluding by determining the severity of a collision. The risk framework is developed with the use of Bayesian Belief Networks and utilizes a set of analytical methods for the estimation of the risk model parameters. Finally, a case study is presented, in which the risk framework developed here is applied to a maritime transportation system operating in the Gulf of Finland (GoF). The results obtained are compared to the historical data and available models, in which a RoPax was involved in a collision, and good agreement with the available records is found...|$|E

Further it was and it is still highly desirable to develop design tools which could provide guidance for the construction of ship hulls which will minimize as far as possible the risk in case of a collision. In order to assess the collision behaviour of a ship, {{there is a need to}} test her under specific collision incidents, which are described by a number of parameters, such as the particulars of the striking ship including the stiffness of her bow, the speeds and relative orientation of the two vessels, sea conditions, etc. The assessment methodologies are deterministic, i. e. they are based on one or a few severe collision scenarios, or probabilistic, i. e. they consider distribution functions of one or more collision parameters. The paper presents and discusses existing codes concerning collision scenarios for floating and fixed marine structures, presents data that can be used for the determination of the level of the loading that a ship may experience if she is involved in a collision and gives examples of relevant calculations. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.
