40|$|The three {{cities of}} Hong Kong, Taipei and Kaohsiung all feature {{state-of-the-art}} transit systems, but transit commuting rates are markedly different, ranging {{from less than}} 10 per cent in Kaohsiung to about 90 per cent in Hong Kong. This paper looks at the effect of transit <b>station</b> <b>accessibility</b> on housing prices in these three cities, which are all located on the south-eastern edge of the Greater China region. The key finding is that accessibility impacts stand in an inverse relationship to the size and popularity of the transit system. The results illustrate how intraregional variability in overall transit accessibility declines with increases in the spatial coverage of transit systems. The price premium for housing near transit stations is therefore greatest in Kaohsiung and smallest in Hong Kong, with Taipei exhibiting intermediate levels. Conversely, average land values are highest in Hong Kong and lowest in Kaohsiung...|$|E

40|$|A hedonic {{pricing model}} is {{estimated}} to analyse the impact of railways on house prices in terms of distance to railway station, frequency of railway services and distance to the railway line. Correcting {{for a wide range}} of other determinants of house prices we find that dwellings very close to a station are on average about 25 % more expensive than dwellings at a distance of 15 kilometres or more. A doubling of frequency leads to an increase of house values of about 2. 5 %, ranging from 3. 5 % for houses close to the station to 1. 3 % for houses far away. Finally we find a negative effect of distance to railways, probably due to noise effects. Two railway station references were used in the analysis: the nearest and most frequently chosen station in the post code area. This distinction indicates that railway <b>station</b> <b>accessibility</b> is a more complex concept than one might think.

40|$|While {{there are}} many {{proposals}} for fixing congestion between San Francisco and Oakland in California by adding a new bridge or tube, these solutions will take decades to implement even though a solution is needed now. This thesis assesses sixteen different strategies for reducing congestion in the short-term in the four categories of improving transit, promoting carpooling, implementing intelligent transportation systems practices, and incentivizing alternatives to using the Bay Bridge. Top priorities include HOV improvements on the West Grand Avenue and Powell Street onramps, altering WestCAT Lynx and BART transit services, partnering with rideshare apps to increase transit <b>station</b> <b>accessibility</b> (last mile problem), partnering with vanpool/minibus apps, promoting carpooling and implementing a citizen report system for carpool violators, shifting corporate cultures away from requiring employees to drive and drive alone, and lastly, altering land-use planning practices.

Ridership and capacity data for the various modes of transportation across the bay were assessed for shortfalls and opportunities. Through this research and its resultant conclusions, focus can {{be placed on the}} best strategies to pursue in the near-term, while the Bay Area waits on a second bridge or tube in the long-term...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this paper}} is to gain further insight into the way in which resi-dential ocation choice {{behavior}} is related to the existence of public transport facilities and to distance to the workplace. More specifically, the objectives of this paper are two-fold. The first objective is to gain more insight into the influence of the characteristics of residential locations on residential location choice behavior. The selected characteristics are related to three aspects: (a) the residence itself (dwelling type, costs, type of neighbor-hood); (b) the transportation facilities in the residential neighborhood (frequency of bus services, availability of railway <b>station,</b> <b>accessibility</b> to main road system); and (c) the travel time from the residential location to the workplace (car, public transportation, and bike). The second objective is to test a model of joint (multi-person) decision making behavior. The results of this research indicate that the preference for a particular residen-tial location is highly dependent on the characteristics of the dwelling and its environ-ment, and to a lesser extent on the travel time to the workplace. The characteristics pertaining to transportation facilities eem to be less important. These results imply that transportation policy is not necessarily an effective instrument to influence residential choice behavior and the associated mobility. 1...|$|E

Intercept surveys are used to collect data on factors affecting train <b>station</b> <b>accessibility</b> for patrons aged 60 years or older, at seven highly dispersed train stations. Overall accessibility is measured separately using a composite index based on three travel modes (walk-and-ride, park-and-ride and bus-and-ride). The results illustrate that key variables, such as distance from an origin to a station, walking or driving route directness, land-use diversity, service and facility quality, bus connection to train stations, all affect the accessibility to train stations for the elderly. This implies that improvements to these factors will improve accessibility for this population group...|$|E

40|$|Electric vehicle-sharing {{systems have}} been {{introduced}} {{to a number of}} cities as a means of increasing mobility, reducing congestion, and pollution. Electric vehicle-sharing systems can offer one or two-way services. One-way systems provide more flexibility to users since they can be dropped-off at any station. However, their modeling involves a number of complexities arising from the need to relocate vehicles accumulated at certain stations. The planning of one-way electric vehicle-sharing systems involves a host of strongly interacting decisions regarding the number, size and location of stations, as well as the fleet size. In this paper we develop and solve a multi-objective MILP model for planning one-way vehicle-sharing systems taking into account vehicle relocation and electric vehicle charging requirements. For real world problems the size of the problem becomes intractable due to the extremely large number of relocation variables. In order to cope with this problem we introduce an aggregate model using the concept of the virtual hub. This transformation allows the solution of the problem with a branch-and-bound approach. The proposed approach generates the efficient frontier and allows decision makers to examine the trade-off between operator’s and users’ benefits. The capabilities of the proposed approach are demonstrated on a large scale real world problem with available data from Nice, France. Extensive sensitivity analysis was performed by varying demand, <b>station</b> <b>accessibility</b> distance and subsidy levels. The results provide useful insights regarding the efficient planning of one-way electric vehicle-sharing systems and allow decision makers to quantify the trade-off between operator’s and users’ benefits...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) {{has long}} been a {{powerful}} tool for improving sustainable urban development. A well-designed TOD project enhances the accessibility to different kinds of activities, decreases transportation cost, and increases the travel comfort level, thereby expanding the willingness to pay for the properties around it. This study measures the impact of Transit-Oriented Development on single-family property value within 1. 5 mile radius around Renton Transit Center, a TOD project implemented 18 years ago in King County, WA. Using time-series Hedonic Price Analysis (HPA), results of this study corroborate the mainstream view that TOD has premium effects on surrounding property values. Controlling other variables affecting housing price, increasing the accessibility to the Transit Center by one standard deviation distance (1890 feet, or about 0. 36 mile) is associated with an 11 % increase of the housing price during TOD-construction time. In post-TOD time, increasing the accessibility by one standard deviation distance (1781 feet, or about 0. 33 mile) is linked to a 13 % increase of the housing price. Results for time-series dummy variables show that properties sold at a lower price in pre-TOD time than those after TOD took into effect. Then, Hedonic Method is used for three time intervals of before-TOD, during-TOD, and post-TOD. Results show that the insignificant influence of TOD accessibility before TOD operation becomes significantly positive after TOD took place. However, the premium effect of TOD could be reduced due to TOD-related nuisance. Properties located in areas with high percentage of commercial uses and very compact street network systems were sold at a discount. This suggests that besides benefiting from <b>station</b> <b>accessibility,</b> station area properties may also have suffered from TOD-related nuisance that can reduce the benefits to some extent. Findings suggest that local government under fiscal stress could generate additional revenue source through innovative TOD projects and programs, yet to find an appropriate strategy for mixed land use development near the station also needs to be considered...|$|E
40|$|Executive summaryThe Council of Social Service of New South Wales (NCOSS) report {{discusses}} {{findings from}} a small qualitative study exploring public and community transport use in the inner Sydney suburb of Newtown and its surrounds. The study had a focus on accessible public transport and linked with the ‘All Aboard NSW’ social media campaign. A total of 137 public and community transport passengers participated in the study; 68 rail passengers at Newtown Station, 51 participants of Newtown Neighbourhood Centre (NNC) and 18 Community Transport passengers on the Marrickville Jetstream. They were asked questions relating to the physical upgrade at Newtown <b>station,</b> <b>accessibility,</b> disability, social inclusion, safety and their experiences as consumers of public and community transport. Responses from the study’s participants about the recent upgrade of Newtown Station were very positive, identifying improved elements of accessibility, safety, and information. There was {{an emphasis on the}} station’s newly installed lift; respondents said the lift had improved access for people with disability (especially people in wheelchairs), older people with mobility limitations, and parents with young children and prams. Focus groups conducted at Newtown Neighbourhood Centre identified a range of issues with bus usage, including criticism directed at the unreliability of buses within Newtown and surrounding areas. Participants were also critical of some bus driver behaviour, commenting on lack of courtesy and unwillingness to assist patrons. Other feedback affirmed the importance of transport for social inclusion, as well as fostering independence for older users of public transport. Social inclusion and independence were key themes raised by Community Transport passengers. Interviews conducted on board the Marrickville Jetstream showed there are many barriers to using public transport for older people with limited mobility and/or health issues. Community Transport fills an important gap and niche for this population group. The report makes the following four key conclusions:The importance of lifts within train stations The need for bus services to improve frequency and driver behaviour Public and community transport is an enabler of independence for older people, and The critical role of public transport (which includes Community Transport) in fostering social inclusion. Our study found that the Newtown station upgrade has improved public transport users’ access to trains, and this in turn enables people to be included in their wider community. We found that working lifts not only provide access to people using wheelchairs; they also provide access for the growing demographic of older people, many of whom have limited mobility. We recommend that lifts be prioritised as an essential piece of infrastructure for train stations across the Sydney Trains (previously CityRail) network. NCOSS hopes that this report contributes to further improvement in transport across Sydney neighbourhoods, specifically regarding the accessibility of train stations...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Much {{analysis}} of rail travel demand in Great Britain has been undertaken using time-series direct demand models, for example Jones and Nichols (1983), and Owen and Phillips (1987). In these models, changes in demand {{over time are}} explained {{as a function of}} independent variables that change incrementally over the same time period. However, such an incremental approach is of no use for forecasting the demand from new stations, or for other new rail services. Furthermore, this approach does not handle competition between different stations, nor the impact of access on either rail demand or rail elasticities. There is, therefore, a need for cross-sectional models which can forecast demand for journeys from new stations, or in response to population changes, changes in <b>station</b> <b>accessibility</b> or radical service quality changes. Previous examples include Tyler and Hassard (1973), Holt and White (1981), Shilton (1982), Jones and White (1994), and Wardman (1996). These authors were unable, for obvious reasons, {{to take advantage of the}} new opportunities for developing such models which have been presented by the increased availability of machine-readable Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data on populations and road networks. Such data can be combined with data on rail passenger flows and revenues and on rail service quality, these latter data being those already used to develop time-series models. Arising on the growth of computing power, a further opportunity is now presented for potentially more sophisticated cross-sectional models, which may not be amenable to linear regression, to be calibrated using non-linear regression. Some initial attempts to build more sophisticated models have already been reported (Lythgoe and Wardman, 2002; 2004). The objective of this paper is to generalise the station choice model from the earlier work and to show how various limitations have been overcome. There is an emphasis on replacing the MNL station choice form by a particular cross-nested logit form, with different dissimilarity parameters between given station i and each of its competing stations. Introducing such a cross-nested logit form enables the proportion of new journeys from station i abstracted from its competitors to be dependant, inter alia, on the proximity of station i to each of those competitors. In particular, what we propose here is an improvement in that the previous model could only be applied to a subset of origin stations, namely Parkway stations. Also, when fitting the data, a specification error that had been previously identified is remedied by introducing a population elasticity. The origin station choice model described in this paper builds on the original Parkway station model (Lythgoe and Wardman, 2002; 2004) and can predict the demand for inter-urban rail journeys of over 40 km between pairs of stations in Great Britain. It is based upon 10, 324 observed demand levels from 329 existing stations to 334 destination stations. The aim is that it should be more straightforward to apply than existing techniques for forecasting demand from new or greatly revised stations and services, and that it should provide consistent results...|$|E
5000|$|Phase II of this project, {{completed}} in November 2002, {{consisted of the}} construction of new station facilities {{on the other side of}} Woodbourne Road, adjacent to the new parking lot.

New gooseneck style lighting fixtures were installed throughout the <b>station</b> area. <b>Accessibility</b> features include new tactile edging, a mini-high level platform, signage, and an AVPA system. Due to the configuration of this three-track territory (2 passenger tracks and one freight track), cross track boarding platforms were installed in order to reach the center (outbound) passenger track.
