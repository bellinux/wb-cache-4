60|$|It was a {{heavy mass}} of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, with a large stone {{courtyard}} before it, <b>and</b> two <b>stone</b> sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony business altogether, with heavy <b>stone</b> balustrades, <b>and</b> <b>stone</b> urns, <b>and</b> <b>stone</b> flowers, <b>and</b> <b>stone</b> faces of men, <b>and</b> <b>stone</b> heads of lions, in all directions.

5|$|The {{reasons for}} the runestone {{tradition}} are {{a matter of debate}} but they include inheritance issues, status and the honouring of the deceased.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the prevalence of calcified carotid artery atheromas detected on panoramic radiographs of patients with renal <b>stones</b> <b>and</b> to assess the correlation of renal <b>stones</b> <b>and</b> carotid artery calcifications (CAC). Panoramic radiographs of 120 renal stone patients (76 males and 44 females) and 120 controls (68 males and 52 females) were examined for any calcifications in the carotid artery. The mean age of the patients with renal <b>stones</b> <b>and</b> controls was 40. 6 ± 7. 8 years and 41. 1 ± 6. 7 years, respectively. A total of 25 (20. 8 %) patients with renal <b>stones</b> <b>and</b> 16 (12. 3 %) patients from the control group showed CAC. The calcifications were however higher in the patients with renal stones, but there was no statistically significant difference (P > 0. 05) between the two groups. CAC was found in 15 males and ten females with renal <b>stones</b> <b>and</b> nine males and seven females of the control group, and this difference was not statistically significant (P > 0. 05). In the present study, no significant relationship was found between the presence of CAC in the patients with renal <b>stones</b> <b>and</b> the control group. However, there was a trend for higher prevalence of CAC in renal stone patients...|$|R

5|$|At Lulworth Cove, {{the waves}} have cut {{their way through}} the {{resistant}} Portland <b>stone</b> <b>and</b> created a horseshoe-shaped cove by eroding the softer sands and clays behind.

5|$|Both of {{the country}} club's Route 9 entrances have a gatehouse. Both are small, two stories high, three bays wide, and one bay deep, and were {{constructed}} along with {{the house in the}} 1890s. The gatehouses resemble Woodlea in materials and simplified stylistic detail. Both gatehouses have gable roofs and a shed-roofed one-story high rear addition. The houses have <b>stone</b> <b>and</b> brick pedimented porticos over their entranceways. The lower-level windows have flat-arched surrounds with keystones; the oculi break the cornice lines beneath segmentally arched pediments. The northern gatehouse has another one-story rear addition and a small one-car garage. The club's two tall gateways are made of French-imported carved <b>stone</b> <b>and</b> ironwork.|$|E

5|$|Despite his proclaimed lack of {{interest}} in the gubernatorial nomination, Brown's name was entered as a candidate on the first ballot, along with Parker Watkins Hardin, former Congressman William J. <b>Stone,</b> <b>and</b> William Goebel, President Pro Tempore of the state senate. The convention was thrown into chaos when a widely known agreement between <b>Stone</b> <b>and</b> Goebel – designed to get Hardin out of the race – broke down. As balloting continued over the next four days (Sunday excepted) with no candidate receiving a majority, Brown continued to receive a few votes on each ballot. Finally, the convention delegates decided to drop the candidate with the lowest vote total until one candidate received a majority; this resulted in the nomination of Goebel a few ballots later.|$|E
