25|$|There is {{debate as}} to whether the higher rate of breast cancer {{associated}} with obesity is due to a biological difference in the cancer itself, or differences in other factors such as health screen practices. It has been suggested that obesity may be a determinant for breast cancer screening by mammography. Seventeen scientific <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> have found that as obesity increases in women over 40 years of age the rate of mammography reported decreases significantly. When stratified by race (white vs. black) there was a stronger relationship between obesity and lack of mammography screening among white women. Another study also found lower rates of mammography among those who were overweight and obese compared to those women who were of normal body mass index—this effect was only seen in white women. Obese {{women are more likely to}} list pain associated with mammograms as a reason for not getting screened; however, leaner women also list this as a reason for avoiding mammograms. Other reasons obese women may avoid mammography are due to lack of insurance, low income, or embarrassment at the procedure, although when these factors are accounted for, the effect of lower rates of screening are still significant. In contrast, other studies have shown that mammography patterns did not differ among women who were obese compared to those at a healthy weight indicating that there may be biological differences in cancer presentation between these groups.|$|E

500|$|Because {{of a lack}} {{of clarity}} about laws about {{psilocybin}} mushrooms, retailers in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade) commercialized and marketed them in smartshops in the Netherlands and the UK, and online. Several websites emerged that have contributed to the accessibility of information on description, use, effects and exchange of experiences among users. Since 2001, six EU countries have tightened their legislation on psilocybin mushrooms in response to concerns about their prevalence and increasing usage. In the 1990s, hallucinogens and their effects on human consciousness were again the subject of scientific study, particularly in Europe. Advances in neuropharmacology and neuropsychology, and the availability of brain imaging techniques have provided impetus for using drugs like psilocybin to probe the [...] "neural underpinnings of psychotic symptom formation including ego disorders and hallucinations".

500|$|The {{book was}} used to teach {{literary}} theory at universities beginning not long after publication and remained dominant into the mid-1960s, at which time an increasingly heterogeneous academia questioned the universal value of literature; literary theorist Terry Eagleton finds that, after the 1960s, [...] "it was {{no longer possible to}} take for granted what what literature was, how to read it, or what social functions it might serve". Steven Mailloux describes Theory of Literature as crystallizing an American movement towards intrinsic literary criticism, as dominated by New Criticism, while van Rees credits the book with popularizing a text-oriented interpretation. Grabowicz writes that its importance for both American and general literary studies is [...] "indisputable". Writing in 1987, Jeremy Hawthorn described the book as an [...] "excellent introductory study", despite extrinsic studies having become more dominant in literary criticism, while Holquist found that the book could still [...] "be usefully invoked" [...] in literary debates of the early 21stcentury.

2500|$|Contemporary Korean historians {{trace the}} roots of {{nationalist}} historiography to the Korean independence movement, which emerged {{in response to the}} rise of Japanese influence in Korea after Japan's victory in the Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895). Starting in 1895, Korean newspapers started to foster new ways of imagining Korea. In 1896 Seo Jae-pil (1864–1951) and Yun Chi-ho (1864–1945) founded the bilingual (English-Korean) Tongnip Sinmun (the Independent), which was the first Korean newspaper to be published in Hangul. Seo and Yun, who had both come into contact with ideas of [...] "nation" [...] and [...] "independence" [...] during their <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> tried to promote national consciousness among Koreans, partly through historical education. In 1899 the newspaper translated into vernacular Korean an essay [...] "On Patriotism" [...] that Chinese journalist and historian Liang Qichao had recently published in Japan. But such calls for [...] "Korean political unity and racial solidarity" [...] in turn-of-the-century newspapers were censored by Japanese colonial authorities. The Tongnip Sinmun was thus forced to close later in 1899. Japanese authorities also suppressed private schools that tried to promote patriotism through the teaching of Korean history, language, and customs.|$|E
