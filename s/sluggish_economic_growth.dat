40|$|From Preface] Since 1989, the {{countries}} of Central and Eastern Europe have faced both challenges and opportunities {{in the field of}} human resource development. The challenges arise from major structural changes, such as economic restructuring and privatization and their adverse effects on <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> and employment. <b>Sluggish</b> or unstable <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> and the associated drop in labour demand, accompanied by an expansion of the informal economy, have contributed to high unemployment and the proliferation of precarious, poor quality jobs. This has resulted in significant waste of human resources. Apathy has spread among the emerging group of the working poor in formal and informal economies alike, undermining individual motivation to attend training and improve employability. At the same time, opportunities have emerged with the introduction of new forms of work organization and technologies, demanding high levels of skill and flexible working attitudes. As aspirations for high educational attainment remain strong across the region, there are good prospects for a high 2 ̆ 2 social and economic return 2 ̆ 2 on future investments in human resource development and training...|$|R
40|$|MBA 2014 ABSTRACT In a {{socio-economic}} era characterised by <b>sluggish</b> global <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> {{as well as}} wide-spread social challenges, businesses, {{governments and}} society at large seek ways and means to create economic value {{in a way that}} is also socially responsible. It is against this backdrop that Porter and Kramer (2011), in their ground breaking article, “The big Idea: Creating shared value”, argue that a concept they coin as “shared value”, has the ability to address the globes <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> concerns whilst also addressing its societal challenges. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which Multinational Corporations based in South Africa regard shared value as a strategic imperative when expanding business operations into the African continent. In order to achieve this end, 5 top-of-mind South African based companies were studied, based on their broad African footprint, and sustained success on the African continent. Semi-structured guided interviews were then conducted with senior executives and strategy professionals at these organisations in order to ascertain the strategic concerns regarded by their organisations as imperative in nature. Content analysis was then used to extract emergent themes and outcomes from the transcribed interviews conducted. It was found that although shared value, as it is very specifically defined by Porter and Kramer (2011), was generally quite poorly understood, varying degrees of overall understanding of shared value as a whole were observed between organisations. This main finding serves as key evidence to all affected and interested parties of the possible beginnings of a paradigm shift in business thinking as it pertains to defining its role within society at large...|$|R

He also insisted that actual living standards in Japan were {{much lower than the}} impression given by statistics such as per capita GDP.

In an attempt to cope with the difficult economic situation, the currency was devalued, but correcting the persistent current account deficit proved difficult. A severe housing shortage prompted the introduction of state funding for housing mortgages implemented through Landsbanki’s mortgage division to help rectify the situation. [...] Concerned about <b>sluggish</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth,</b> the government sought ways to support industry - recognising that fisheries was the key sector - and a Fisheries Credit Department was established under Landsbanki’s auspices. As a result of its open-handed lending policy to the fishing industry, borrowing by this sector doubled in the following decades, rising from 23% of total loans outstanding in 1941 to 46% in 1960. The development was reflected in the major surge in the contribution of fisheries to GDP.|$|E

40|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding {{the direction of}} causality between saving and <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> motivated this study. The author employed the Granger-causality and co-integration techniques to analyze the relationship between saving and <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> in Nigeria during the period 1970 - 2007. The Johansen co-integration test indicates that the variables (<b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> and saving) are co-integrated, and that a long-run equilibrium exists between them. In addition, the granger causality test reveals that causality runs from <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> to saving, implying that <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> precedes and granger causes saving. Thus, we reject the Solow’s hypothesis that saving precedes <b>economic</b> <b>growth,</b> and accept the Keynesian theory that t is <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> that leads to higher saving. The author recommends that government and policy makers should employ policies that would accelerate <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> so as to increase saving. <b>economic</b> <b>growth,</b> saving, granger causality, co-integration. ...|$|R
