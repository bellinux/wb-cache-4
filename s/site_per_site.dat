40|$|AbstraktiAt its {{northern}} distribution limits, growth of Scots pine is generally driven by summer temperature. However, some studies found a decoupling of tree growth and summer temperature {{in certain parts}} of boreal Eurasia and propose reduced water availability as a possible explanation (e. g. Wilmking et al. 2005). Moreover, Düthorn et al. (e. g. 2016) demonstrated that differing micro-site conditions influence Scots pine growth in Fennoscandia. To investigate the effect of differing micro-site conditions on a broader spatial scale, we analyzed tree-ring width (TRW) and maximum latewood density (MXD) over six sites, spanning three latitudinal gradients in Eurasia (Finland, Western and Central Russia), and included dry and wet micro-site conditions at each <b>site.</b> <b>Per</b> <b>site</b> and proxy we performed a Principal Component Gradient Analysis (PCGA) to explore the existence of sub-populations with different growth patterns. For each identified sub-population proxy, climate-growth relationships were calculated. At five out of six sites, PCGA showed a clear distinction between dry and wet micro-sites. Corresponding climate correlations were stronger on dry than on wet sites with more pronounced effects for TRW in comparison to MXD. Concluding, our preliminary results corroborate the assumption that Scots pine growth might be affected by micro-site conditions, which certainly has implications for dendroecological and –climatological studies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAir Pollution {{monitoring}} and measurement are generally done using sampling techniques and analysis equipment often heavy, complex and expensive. Although these methods offer a high measurement precision which is essential to answer standards requirements, they are not adapted for quality oriented applications where simple information with low precision can be sufficient. The use of semiconductor gas sensors networks can provide the answer for a “low cost” system intended for such applications in air pollution detection fields. Three identical portable autonomous sensors arrays were built, each containing nine commercial semiconductor sensors especially chosen to detect a large range of pollutants usually encountered in ambient air and for {{a large part of}} them regulated. In order to overcome the temporal instability and the lack of reproducibility of these sensors, a calibration and normalisation procedure was developed. The obtained systems were used for on-site pollution monitoring in association with the French National Network of Accredited Associations for Air Quality Monitoring (AASQA). Gathered data from sensors systems and network data (NO, NO 2, CO, PM 2, 5, …) were treated using nonlinear regression algorithms like Neural Networks with an original “fuzzy logic” type pre-treatment in order to compute a model able to predict the membership degree for three predefined pollution categories: traffic, urban and photochemical pollution, along with a pollution index describing the severity of the predominant pollution.

We {{have shown}} that intracerebroventricular injection of N/OFQ reverses the hypophagic effect induced by stress or by CRF given intracerebroventricularly. To shed {{new light on the}} mechanisms involved in the anti-CRF action of N/OFQ, we investigated the ability of N/OFQ to prevent CRF-induced anorexia after microinjection studies into brain areas of potential interest in the control of feeding behavior and coexpressing NOP and CRF receptors. These areas include the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), the central amygdala (CeA), the locus ceruleus (LC), the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the dorsal raphe (DR). The results demonstrated that the anorectic effect of 0. 04 nmol of CRF per rat (200 ng per rat) given intracerebroventricularly is reversed by pretreatment with 0. 01 – 0. 21 nmol of N/OFQ per rat (25 – 500 ng per rat) injected into the BNST but not into the CeA, LC, VMH, PVN, or DR. Microinjection of 0. 01 – 0. 02 nmol of CRF <b>per</b> <b>site</b> (50 – 100 ng <b>per</b> <b>site)</b> into the BNST but not into the CeA or the LC induced marked anorexia in food-deprived rats.

Gene-to-gene differences in numbers of substitutions <b>per</b> <b>site</b> {{were found to be}} higher for nonsynonymous than synonymous sites, and this could be due to differential selection if mutation rate is assumed constant for the genome.

Generation time, population size, and speciation rate are likely factors involved in this rate heterogeneity.
