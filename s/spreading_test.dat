30|$|All {{isolated}} bacteria {{were screened}} {{for a high}} biosurfactant-producing activity. Screening was carried out against qualitative (hemolytic blood assay and oil <b>spreading</b> <b>test)</b> and semi-quantitative (emulsification index) parameters. Based on the result, an isolate that was coded G 3 showed the highest emulsification activity (Ei[*]=[*] 72.90 %). This result indicates that isolate G 3 was a biosurfactant-producing bacterium with the highest MEOR potential among other isolates. This bacterium could grow at a moderately high temperature of up to 55  °C. The negative correlation between its hemolytic type (G 3 is of gamma type) and its emulsification activity may result because the biosurfactant failed to diffuse to the surrounding blood agar media, as reported and reviewed in several studies (Marchant and Banat 2014; Walter et al. 2010). This prevents the biosurfactant from exhibiting hemolytic activity.|$|E

Methods Six patients with HFS were recruited. Supraorbital nerve stimulation with orbicularis oris muscle recording and the lateral <b>spread</b> <b>test</b> were performed, followed by intravenous application of 10 mg diazepam to achieve facial motor neuron suppression. Subsequently, we repeated the two electrophysiological experiments mentioned above at 10 and 20 minutes after the patients had received the diazepam intravenously. Results Orbicularis oris muscle responses were observed in all patients after supraorbital nerve stimulation and lateral <b>spread</b> <b>tests.</b> After the diazepam injection, no orbicularis oris muscle response to supraorbital nerve stimulation was observed in one patient, and the latencies of this response were evident as a slowing tendency with time in the remaining five patients. However, the latencies of the orbicularis oris muscle responses were observed consistently in all patients in the lateral <b>spread</b> <b>test.</b> Conclusion Our results suggest that ectopic excitation/ephaptic transmission contributes to the pathophysiological mechanisms of HFS.

40|$|Adaptive Random Testing (ART) was {{developed}} to enhance the failure detection capability of Random Testing. The basic principle of ART is to enforce random test cases evenly spread inside the input domain. Various distribution metrics {{have been used to}} measure different aspects of the evenness of test case distribution. As expected, it has been observed that the failure detection capability of an ART algorithm is related to how evenly test cases are distributed. Motivated by such an observation, we propose a new family of ART algorithms, namely distribution metric driven ART, in which, distribution metrics are key drivers for evenly <b>spreading</b> <b>test</b> cases inside ART.

On the basis of differential thermogravimetric analysis, minerals decrease forest species combustibility (by increasing maximum weight loss rate and combustion duration) and consumability (by increasing combustion mass residue) and increase their sustainability (by increasing combustion duration). Additionally, the flame <b>spread</b> <b>tests</b> indicate that the minerals decrease forest species ignitability (increase time for ignition) and combustibility (decrease flame spread rate, maximum flame height and mean flame intensity), and affect their sustainability (by increasing the flame duration) and consumability (by increasing the mass residue).

In this paper, we introduce the concept of localization that can be integrated with some ART methods to reduce the distance computation overheads.

This study explored the value of line <b>spread</b> <b>testing</b> (distance a liquid flows) in comparison to viscometry readings for differentiating a variety of modified liquids prepared to nectar-thick vs. honey-like consistency. Method: We tested combinations of four thickening products (three starch-based and one gum-based thickener) prepared with six serving temperature beverages that had various levels of fat, fiber, and added nutrients. A total of 32 product/liquid combinations measured within the target range of 80 - 800 centipoise (cP). Measurements were recorded from the Line Spread Test (after 60 seconds of spread) and a Brookfield RVDV-II+ viscometer. Results: Nectar-thick and honey-like consistencies significantly differed in their degree of spread. Using our line spread apparatus, a value of 4. 5 centimeters (cm) differentiated between nectar-thick and honey-like consistencies. There was an inverse correlation (-. 75) between viscometer data and line <b>spread</b> <b>test</b> results across consistencies.

Neither the Balsara Switch nor Time Dependent Viscosity work effectively, as they leave AV active in areas of smooth shearing flow, and do not eliminate the accumulation of alignments of particles in the prograde direction. The effect of both switches is periodic, the periodicity dependent on radius and unaffected by the density of particles. We demonstrate that a very simple algorithm activates AV only when truly convergent flow is detected and reduces the unwanted formation of prograde alignments. The new switch works by testing whether all the neighbours of a particle are in Keplerian orbit around the same point, rather than calculating the divergence of the velocity field, which is very strongly affected by Poisson noise in {{the positions of the}} SPH particles.

40|$|Random testing {{techniques}} have been extensively used in reliability assessment, {{as well as}} in debug testing. When used to assess software reliability, random testing selects test cases based on an operational profile; while in the context of debug testing, random testing often uses a uniform distribution. However, generally neither an operational profile nor a uniform distribution is chosen from the perspective of maximizing the effectiveness of failure detection. Adaptive random testing has been proposed to enhance the failure detection capability of random testing by evenly <b>spreading</b> <b>test</b> cases over the whole input domain. In this paper, we propose a new test profile, which is different from both the uniform distribution, and operational profiles. The aim of the new test profile is to maximize the effectiveness of failure detection. We integrate this new test profile with some existing adaptive random testing algorithms, and develop a family of new random testing algorithms. These new algorithms not only distribute test cases more evenly, but also have better failure detection capabilities than the corresponding original adaptive random testing algorithms. As a consequence, they perform better than the pure random testing...|$|E

40|$|One major {{objective}} of software testing is to reveal software failures such that program bugs can be removed. Random testing {{is a basic}} and simple software testing technique, but its failure-detection effectiveness is often controversial. Based on the common observation that program inputs causing software failures tend to cluster into contiguous regions, some researchers have proposed that an even <b>spread</b> of <b>test</b> cases should enhance the failure-detection effectiveness of random testing. Adaptive random testing refers to a family of algorithms to evenly <b>spread</b> random <b>test</b> cases based on various notions. Restricted random testing, an algorithm to implement adaptive random testing by the notion of exclusion, defines an exclusion region around each previously executed test case, and selects test cases only from outside all exclusion regions. Although having a high failure-detection effectiveness, restricted random testing has a very high computation overhead, and it rigidly discards all test cases inside any exclusion region, {{some of which may}} reveal software failures. In this paper, we propose a new method to implement adaptive random testing by exclusion, where test cases are simply selected based on a welldesigned test profile. The new method has a low computation overhead and it does not omit any possible program inputs that can detect failures. Our experimental results show that the new method not only <b>spreads</b> <b>test</b> cases more evenly but also brings a higher failure-detection effectiveness than random testing...|$|R

In the area of fire safety, this requires understanding of, and compliance with, global regulatory requirements. This research develops a systematic approach that can be utilized to analyze and compare the complex fire safety regulatory requirements that are stipulated for a selected topic in various countries. The approach developed is sufficiently general that it can be leveraged to compare and contrast global standards in any field or discipline. The methodology outlines six aspects of the regulatory environment that must be considered in sorting standards and then uses spreadsheets and a mind mapping program to elucidate the many relationships that exist amongst the current standards. In this work, flammability test requirements for public transportation seating are studied, with a major emphasis on seating for railway applications. Requirements for seating in aviation, automotive (both cars and buses) and military vehicles are included in the discussion for comparative purposes. Fire is a complex phenomenon that is difficult to characterize. The legislated testing protocols reflect this complexity with some geographic jurisdictions mandating as many as six different types of fire testing for rail seating. This work looks in depth at two of the main types of fire testing: flame <b>spread</b> <b>testing</b> and toxic effluent <b>testing.</b> Flame <b>spread</b> <b>testing</b> was chosen because it is widely required, and toxic effluent testing was chosen because of the many complexities and ambiguities present amongst these standards.

By using two simulation software FLUENT and FDS, comparative study of their mathematical models was conducted. By comparison between simulation software field and simulation technology theory {{as well as the}} contrast of the physical model of fire smoke spread, and according to the smoke <b>spread</b> <b>test</b> results in Tianjin Xiawafang Subway Station, this paper compared the numerical results of the two simulation software respectively, expecting to use for reference for the study of smoke spread in subway platform fire in the future...|$|R
