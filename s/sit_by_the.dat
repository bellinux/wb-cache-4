Scully claims he shot her, while Mulder claims she shot him. Mulder realizes that {{that could not have}} happened and stands up. The illusion is broken, and the two leave the house. Maurice and Lyda <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents. Meanwhile, at Mulder's apartment, Mulder and Scully exchange gifts, even though they told each other they would not.|$|E

25|$|Nouhad was a shy {{child and}} did not have many friends at school. However, she was very {{attached}} to her grandmother who lived in Debbieh (Shuf area), where Nouhad used to spend her summer holidays. Nouhad seemed to enjoy the rural village life. During the day, Nouhad would help her grandmother with house chores and fetch fresh water from a nearby water spring. She would sing {{all the way to the}} spring and back.

500|$|Longfellow's new landlady {{had earned}} a {{reputation}} for being eccentric and often wore a turban. In the 1840s, Longfellow wrote about an incident when canker-worms were devastating the elm trees on the property. Mrs. Craigie [...] "would <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> open window and let them crawl over her white turban. She refused to have the trees protected against them & said, Why, sir, they have as good a right to live as we—they are our fellow worms". The maid at the time, a woman named Miriam, served Longfellow his meals in his room. Longfellow called her [...] "the giantess".|$|E
500|$|In August 2008, Australian {{recording}} artist Sia confirmed {{that she would}} work on several ballads for Aguilera's then-upcoming album. Aguilera commented about the collaboration, [...] "I'm definitely a fan of Sia's. I was thrilled she also wanted to work together and, in turn, was a fan of mine". In an interview for Billboard, Sia said, [...] "She [...] was just excited {{to get to work}} with the artists she loves. There's this misconception that she's a middle-America kind of person. But she's a little hipster. You go back to her house and <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire with some wine, and what's playing over the sound system? The Knife and Arthur Russell. She doesn't listen to pop music".|$|E

500|$|Like in The Kampung Boy, {{the scenes}} in Yesterday and Today are {{presented}} in great detail. [...] Lat shows the children playing with items constructed from simple items found in the household and nature. [...] He also illustrates the toys' schematics. [...] He compares the games with their modern counterparts, lamenting the loss of creativity in modern youths. [...] Other comments on societal changes are in the book. [...] A child is taking a swimming lesson in a pool, intently watched by his parents who have a maid in tow with various items in her hands. [...] While the parents gesticulate wildly at their son, the lifeguard and instructor calmly <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pool, watching the boy's smooth progress. [...] This scene is contrasted with Lat's own experience {{at the hands of}} his father, who casually tosses the terrified boy into a river, letting him either swim or flounder. [...] Such details, according to Muliyadi, invoke a yearning for the past and help readers [...] "better appreciate [...] cartoons".|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Forest Service in 1928, Marshall worked to {{complete}} his studies for a PhD in plant physiology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. The following year {{he made his first}} trip to Alaska, visiting the upper Koyukuk River and the central Brooks Range, and preparing for an extended stay for study. [...] The scientific objective of the trip was to study tree growth at the northern timberline near the Arctic Divide. For his 15-month sojourn {{in the small town of}} Wiseman, Alaska, Marshall rented a one-room cabin next to the only roadhouse in the village. He furnished it with books, records, a phonograph player, and a writing desk. [...] He placed the desk so that he could <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cabin's single window and admire the view of the Koyukuk River and the range of steep, snow-covered mountains in the background. [...] His travels engendered in him a great love for the central Brooks Range in the Alaskan wilderness. [...] Marshall was one of the first to explore much of the range, especially the headwaters of the North fork of the Koyukuk River, where he bestowed the name [...] "Gates of the Arctic" [...] on a pair of mountains, Boreal Mtn. (6,375ft) and Frigid Crags (5,501ft.).|$|E

2500|$|The samovar was an {{important}} attribute of a Russian household and particularly well-suited to tea-drinking in a communal setting over a protracted time period. The Russian expression [...] "to have a <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> samovar" [...] means to have a leisurely talk while drinking tea from a samovar. This compares with the German , Swedish fika or Turkish nargile culture.|$|E
2500|$|Honey, the way {{you play}} guitar makes me feel so... makes me feel so...masochistic. The way you go down low deep into the neck... and I would do anything... and I would do anything. And Patty Hearst, you {{standing}} {{there in front of}} the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread. I was wondering: were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women? Or were you really dead? And now that you're on the run, what goes on in your mind? Your sisters they <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> window. You know, your mama does sit and cry. And your daddy—well, you know what your daddy said Patty. You know what your daddy said, Patty? He said... he said... he said.... "Well, sixty days ago she was such a lovely child. Now here she is, with a gun in her hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Ryder and Ladies Almanack {{abandon the}} Beardsleyesque style of her {{drawings}} for The Book of Repulsive Women {{in favor of}} a visual vocabulary borrowed from French folk art. Several illustrations are closely based on the engravings and woodcuts collected by Pierre Louis Duchartre and René Saulnier in the 1926 book L'Imagerie Populaire—images that had been copied with variations since medieval times. The bawdiness of Ryders illustrations led the U.S. Postal Service to refuse to ship it, and several had to be left out of the first edition, including an image in which Sophia is seen urinating into a chamberpot and one in which Amelia and Kate-Careless <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire knitting codpieces. Parts of the text were also expurgated. In an acerbic introduction, Barnes explained that the missing words and passages had been replaced with asterisks so that readers could see the [...] "havoc" [...] wreaked by censorship. A 1990 Dalkey Archive edition restored the missing drawings, but the original text was lost with the destruction of the manuscript in World War II.|$|E

2500|$|Millar {{became one}} of the most photographed women of the Edwardian period. She had top billing as the Hon. Violet Anstruther in The Orchid, the show that opened the new Gaiety (1903; {{introducing}} the songs [...] "Little Mary", [...] "Liza Ann", and [...] "Come with me to the zoo"). She starred as Rosalie in The Spring Chicken (1905; singing [...] "Alice <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire" [...] and [...] "The Delights of London") and as Lally in The New Aladdin (1906). She next starred as Mitzi in The Girls of Gottenberg (1907; singing the duet [...] "Two Little Sausages", with Edmund Payne, and the Wagnerian parody [...] "Rhinegold"). [...] Soon afterwards, Edwardes cast her as Franzi at the Hicks Theatre in the English-language production of Ein Walzertraum (A Waltz Dream, 1908) by Oscar Straus. [...] Although Millar was able to sell the light musical comedy songs composed for her at the Gaiety, Oscar Straus's music was too demanding for her small voice, and she was sent to New York to star in the Broadway production of The Girls of Gottenberg.|$|E
