40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 18 - 20, 1966 / Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaTests {{have been}} {{conducted}} on ten preamps and six receivers to quantitatively determine their linear operating range. The range of linear operation {{was determined by the}} measurement of, or the effects of, intermodulation (IM) products that were produced by the simultaneous application of two input signals. Measurements were made at a frequency equal to twice the frequency of one signal source minus the frequency of the other signal source. Tests of the ten preamps, which included eight <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>units,</b> indicated that their dynamic range varies from approximately 46 to 70 db. Since the IM products of interest vary as the cube of the input signal, the output IM products may vary over a 72 db range, between the preamps tested, for a given input condition. It was found, under the best conditions with some receivers, that their proper operation was prevented by the presence of two signals that were less than 30 db larger than the desired signal. The two interfering signals were located well outside the rated - 60 db bandwidth of the receiver. The results of the tests should provide receiving system designers and operators with a better insight into the problem of RF intermodulation interference. Since no known military interference specifications consider intermodulation as investigated, it is believed that some standard test procedures should be developed by the telemetering community for preamp and receiver testing...|$|R

The system incorporates measurements from a low cost single point GPS and a triaxial <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> inertial/magnetic sensor <b>unit.</b> The navigation algorithm is composed of three modules running on a microcontroller: the sensor calibration module, the attitude estimator, and the velocity and position estimator. The sensor calibration module relies on a recursive least square based ellipsoid hypothesis calibration algorithm to estimate biases and scale factors of accelerometers and magnetometers without any additional calibration equipment. The attitude estimator is a low computational linear attitude fusion algorithm that effectively incorporates high frequency components of gyros and low frequency components of accelerometers and magnetometers to guarantee both accuracy and bandwidth of attitude estimation. The velocity and position estimator uses two cascaded complementary filters which fuse translational acceleration, GPS velocity, and position to improve the bandwidth of velocity and position. The designed navigation system is feasible for miniature UAVs due to its low cost, simplicity, miniaturization, and guaranteed estimation errors. Both ground tests and autonomous flight tests of miniature unmanned helicopter and quadrotor have shown the effectiveness of the proposed system, demonstrating its promise in UAV systems...|$|R
