These facts <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> throw some light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.|$|E

John Evelyn also refers to the ceremony in his Diary on the dates of 6 July 1660 and 28 March 1684.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the serial, Kneale felt that he had now taken the {{character}} of Quatermass as far as he could. [...] "I didn't want to go on repeating because Professor Quatermass had already saved the world from ultimate destruction three times, and that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be quite enough," [...] he said in 1986. It was also his final new collaboration with Rudolph Cartier, although the director did later handle a new version of Kneale's 1953 adaptation of Wuthering Heights for the BBC in 1962.|$|E

500|$|Sullivan {{insisted that}} the next opera must be a grand opera. Gilbert {{did not feel that}} he could write a grand opera libretto, but he offered a {{compromise}} that Sullivan eventually accepted. The two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan a grand opera (Ivanhoe) for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British grand opera. After a brief impasse over the choice of subject, Sullivan accepted an idea connected with Venice and Venetian life, as [...] "this <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> hold out great chances of bright colour and taking music." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of The Secret Service has been mostly negative. Gerry Anderson, however, {{said that it}} was his favourite of all the series that he had produced. Leo Eaton, who directed four episodes, has referred to The Secret Service as [...] "just a bit weird" [...] and questioned the effectiveness of Unwin's humour. Production manager Desmond Saunders' verdict was [...] "strange. I suppose it was the gobbledegook and the mixture of live action with puppets. It never <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be a very good idea." [...] In discussing the production of the series on the website TVCentury21.com, Simon Wickes judges the premise [...] "very strange", and suggests that The Secret Service was made first and foremost to bridge the Andersons' Supermarionation series and their subsequent efforts in live action. Kif Bowden-Smith of the Transdiffusion website concurs with this latter point, describing the mix of puppetry and live action as [...] "an experimental format for the following live-action series".|$|E
500|$|As Pei, {{neared the}} end of his {{secondary}} education, he decided to study at a university. He was accepted to a number of schools, but decided to enroll at the University of Pennsylvania. Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him. The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of Bing Crosby, which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. [...] "College life in the U.S. <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be mostly fun and games", he said in 2000. [...] "Since I was too young to be serious, I {{wanted to be part of}} it... You could get a feeling for it in Bing Crosby's movies. College life in America seemed very exciting to me. It's not real, we know that. Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me. I decided that was the country for me." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1957, Kneale {{was working on the}} scripts for a third and final BBC serial. Titled Quatermass and the Pit and again {{produced}} and directed by Cartier, this was eventually broadcast in December 1958 and January 1959. John Robinson was no longer available to play Quatermass, so the role was offered instead to Alec Clunes. Clunes turned down the part, and it was offered once more to André Morell, who this time accepted. Morell has been praised by several reviewers as having given the definitive portrayal of Quatermass. The serial itself has been praised by the BBC's own website as [...] "simply the first finest thing the BBC ever made. It justifies licence fees to this day." [...] Despite this success, Kneale was unsure about whether the character would ever return, later telling an interviewer: [...] "I didn't want to go on repeating because Professor Quatermass had already saved the world from ultimate destruction three times, and that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be quite enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Gordon and Silver {{moved the}} project to Warner Bros., where Terry Gilliam was {{attached}} to direct. Unsatisfied with how Hamm's script fleshed out the characters, Gilliam brought in Charles McKeown to rewrite it. The second draft, which was credited to Gilliam, Warren Skaaren, and Hamm rather than McKeown, used the character Rorschach's journal as a voice-over, and restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed. According to Watchmen artist Dave Gibbons, filming was to take place at Pinewood Studios. Silver wanted to cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dr. Manhattan. Because both Gilliam and Silver's previous films, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and Die Hard 2 respectively, went over budget, they were only able to raise $25 million for the film—a quarter of the necessary budget. As a result, Gilliam abandoned the project, and ultimately decided that Watchmen was unfilmable. Gilliam explained, [...] "Reducing [...] to a two or two-and-a-half hour film [...] <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take away {{the essence of what}} Watchmen is about." [...] When Warner Bros. dropped the project, Gordon invited Gilliam back to helm the film independently. The director again declined, believing that the comic book would be better directed as a five-hour miniseries.|$|E
500|$|Wallace Harrison's assistant, {{architect}} George Dudley, later stated: [...] "It literally {{took our}} breath away {{to see the}} simple plane of the site kept open from First Avenue to the River, only three structures on it, standing free, a fourth lying low behind them along the river’s edge... also said, ‘beauty {{will come from the}} buildings being in the right space!’. The comparison between Le Corbusier’s heavy block and Niemeyer’s startling, elegantly articulated composition <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be in everyone’s mind..." [...] Later on, Corbusier came once again to Niemeyer and asked him to reposition the Assembly Hall back {{to the center of the}} site. Such modification would destroy Niemeyer’s plans for a large civic square. However, he finally decided to accept the modification: [...] "I felt [...] would like to do his project, and he was the master. I do not regret my decision." [...] Together, they submitted the scheme 23–32, which was built and is what can be seen today. Along with suggestions from the other members of the Board of Design Consultants, this was developed into project 42G. [...] This late project was built with some reductions and other modifications.|$|E

500|$|Orosius' wording {{is echoed}} by the Origo Constantini Imperatoris, an {{anonymous}} work usually dated {{to the late}} 4th century. [...] "Constantine {{was also the first}} Christian emperor, with the exception of Philippus, who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have become a Christian merely in order that the one-thousandth year of Rome might be dedicated to Christ rather than to pagan idols." [...] ("Item Constantinus imperator primus Christianus, excepto Philippo, qui Christianus admodum ad hoc tantum constitutus fuisse mihi visus est, ut millesimus Romae annus Christo potius quam idolis dicaretur", tr. J.C. Rolfe) The scholar Samuel N. C. Lieu holds that this passage is a later interpolation, designed to give the work's pagan core a Christian gloss. According to Lieu, this passage, along with others, was probably taken from Orosius' history and inserted into the Origo Constantini during the reign of Constantine III (r. 417–21), a period that witnessed substantial anti-pagan polemic. Shahîd argues that, since the author of the Origo Constantini was a biographer of Constantine, and not a historian of the 3rd and 4th centuries, his reference to Philip is unnecessary. The conflicting claims of Philip and Constantine to primacy may have been at issue {{at the turn of the}} 5th century, when the Origo Constantini and Historia adversum paganos were written.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} attempts {{to make a film}} version of Watchmen since 1986, when producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver acquired film rights to the series for 20th Century Fox. Fox asked Alan Moore to write a screenplay based on his story, but he declined, so the studio enlisted screenwriter Sam Hamm. Hamm took the liberty of re-writing Watchmens complicated ending into a [...] "more manageable" [...] conclusion involving an assassination and a time paradox. Fox put the project into turnaround in 1991, and the project was moved to Warner Bros., where Terry Gilliam was attached to direct and Charles McKeown to rewrite it. They used the character Rorschach's diary as a voice-over and restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed. Gilliam and Silver were only able to raise $25 million for the film (a quarter of the necessary budget) because their previous films had gone over budget. Gilliam abandoned the project because he decided that Watchmen would have been unfilmable.

500|$|In an {{interview}} {{which appeared in}} The New York Times, Williams said that the choices {{for many of the}} pieces of classical music were made by the studio. He also said that while he did not know why certain pieces were chosen, Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 (commonly known as the Unfinished Symphony), which features prominently in the film, was most likely included because Anderton was a big fan of classical music in the script. Some of the other choices, such as Gideon's playing of Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring by Bach on an organ in the subterranean prison, were also in the screenplay, and he figured that [...] "hey are some writer's conception of what this character might have listened to." [...] Williams did choose the minuet from a Haydn string quartet (Op. 64, No. 1) which plays on the radio in the scene where Dr. Hineman is gardening in her greenhouse. He said he picked the piece because [...] "t <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be the kind of thing a woman like this would play on the radio." [...] The New York Times characterized the score as [...] "evocative" [...] and said it was [...] "thoroughly modern" [...] while also being [...] "interlaced with striking snippets of masterworks." [...] The piece heard when Anderton is shown entering his apartment and he tells his computer system [...] "I'm home" [...] is the 2nd movement of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 in B minor, known as the [...] "Pathetique" [...] Symphony.|$|E

2500|$|The general {{stereotype}} of Ottawa architecture {{is that it}} is staid and unambitious.
