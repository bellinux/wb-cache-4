5|$|The {{reaction}} against the king {{at the general}} council had shown Atholl that James was {{not only on the}} back-foot but his political standing had received a huge set-back and may have convinced the earl that James's death was now a viable course of action. Atholl had <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> assertive action by two of his brothers at different times had allowed them {{to take control of the}} kingdom and that as James's nearest adult relative, the earl must have considered that decisive intervention on his part at this time could prove to be equally successful.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} career, Caesar had <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> chaotic and {{dysfunctional}} the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery {{had broken down}} {{under the weight of}} imperialism, the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. Between his crossing of the Rubicon river in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the empire. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. And finally, he wanted to knit together the entire empire into a single cohesive unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{delayed release}} of Odin Sphere led to {{issues with the}} company: they needed to start other {{projects}} to keep their company going, leading {{to the development of}} GrimGrimoire. The development of GrimGrimoire drained the company's funds, forcing Kamitani to take out a flexible loan of 20 million yen to keep the company afloat and fund development for their next projects, in addition to finding these projects new publishers as Atlus refused to take any more of Vanillaware's products until they had <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> Odin Sphere performed commercially. Nippon Ichi Software would handle GrimGrimoire, while Marvelous Entertainment accepted their next project, Muramasa: The Demon Blade for the Wii. The commercial success of Odin Sphere both enabled the development of Muramasa: The Demon Blade and cleared Kamitani's debt. In tandem with their other titles, Odin Sphere helped establish Vanillaware as a respected developer.|$|E

25|$|The Rimé {{movement}} was a 19th-century movement involving the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma schools of Tibetan Buddhism, {{along with some}} Bon scholars. Having <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> the Gelug institutions pushed the other traditions into the corners of Tibet's cultural life, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820-1892) and Jamgön Kongtrül (1813-1899) compiled together {{the teachings of the}} Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma, including many near-extinct teachings. Without Khyentse and Kongtrul's collecting and printing of rare works, the suppression of Buddhism by the Communists would have been much more final. The Rimé movement is responsible for a number of scriptural compilations, such as the Rinchen Terdzod and the Sheja Dzö.|$|E

Loeb used $250,000 in funding from his mother's accounts to fund the purchase of his share in the papers, and in 1948 used an additional $300,000 to buy out other shareholders and gain complete control of the papers, which he then merged into the Union Leader.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{this was}} shown in the temple reports which were carved in stone when the {{governing}} body (called the epistatai) of the temple changed hands. In the stone IG I3 386-387 it can be <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> the finances of the Eleusinian temples worked. Doctor Maureen B. Cavanaugh who translated stone IG I3 386-387, argues that there were heavy implications of the funding realized from the First Fruits donations to the temple, in particular that it brought significant impact on Athenian power. This is noted in a loan cited in the stone record, of over 20,000 silver drachmas to the city. The Eleusinian temple complex {{was more than just}} a temple to Demeter; there were living quarters, storage, workshops, administration as well as public spaces. It was a major institution, functioning almost like a city within a city.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, Abkhazia {{reported}} that around 10 am of that day, it had shot down another spy plane over {{the village of}} Gagida in Gali district. Georgian television station Mze TV {{reported that}} this had been confirmed by Georgian State Minister for Reintegration Temur Iakobashvili, while Georgian agency InterPressNews reported that an eyewitness had <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> an unmanned aeroplane flew over the coastline {{near the village of}} Primorskoe, followed by a jet, which then shot down the unmanned plane. Still, that day the Georgian Ministry of Defence initially denied that its spy plane had been shot down, stating that it was not conducting any flights over Abkhazia, and that Abkhazian reports were misinformation. In an interview to Mze TV, State Minister for Reintegration Iakobashvili stated that Abkhazia did not possess the technical capability for shooting down unmanned aircraft. According to Iakobashvili there was information that an incident involving an explosion had taken place in the Gali district, and he confirmed that eyewitnesses had seen aircraft, but since Georgia could not send people to the site, it was impossible to determine what had happened. He denounced what had taken place as further attempts to stage a military provocation.|$|E

500|$|On November 6, 2012, Colorado and Washington {{became the}} first states to legalize the sale and {{possession}} of cannabis for recreational use since the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 when they passed Colorado Amendment 64 and Washington Initiative 502. Each regulated marijuana in a way similar to alcohol, allowing possession of up to an ounce for adults ages 21 and older, with [...] "DUID" [...] provisions similar to those against drunk driving. Unlike Initiative 502, Amendment 64 allows personal cultivation (of up to 6 plants). Both provide for commercial cultivation and sales, subject to regulation and taxes.

In the episode, Homer, Bart, and Lisa visit a video game convention called the Expensive Electronic Entertainment Expo (E4), which is {{a reference to the}} Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that is presented annually in the United States by the Entertainment Software Association. This marked {{the first time that the}} family visited a video game convention in The Simpsons. Selman and other staff members on the show had previously visited E3 during the release of The Simpsons video games such as The Simpsons Game.

500|$|One shot {{created by}} Shade VFX {{is when the}} {{audience}} sees Matt Murdock's [...] "vision" [...] – {{the way that he}} [...] "sees" [...] using his other heightened senses. On why this was only used once in the season, DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times, with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season. It was removed for several reasons, including to avoid taking away the specialty of it, and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series. One instance where it would have been used again was in [...] "Stick", where the audience would have <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him, and then when he is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined. In that case, the effect was not finished on time. Another instance was in [...] "The Ones We Leave Behind" [...] when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded. The final use of the effect {{was going to be in}} [...] "Daredevil" [...] when the camera pushes in on Page's reaction Murdock telling her that they can work together. Here, the effect was hiding all of the nuances in her expression, so it was decided that it would be better to remove it.|$|E
500|$|In Eric Shanower's graphic novel Age of Bronze, {{currently}} {{still being}} serialised, Troilus is youthful {{but not the}} youngest son of Priam and Hecuba. In the first two collected volumes of {{this version of the}} Trojan War, Shanower provides a total of six pages of sources covering the story elements of his work alone. These include most of the fictional works discussed above from Guido and Boccaccio down to Morley and Walton. Shanower begins Troilus' love story with the youth making fun of Polyxena's love for Hector and in the process accidentally knocking aside Cressida's veil. He follows the latter into the temple of Athena to gawp at her. Pandarus is the widow Cressida's uncle encouraging him. Cressida rejects Troilus' initial advances not because of wanting to act in a seemly manner, as in Chaucer or Shakespeare, but because she thinks of him as just a boy. However, her uncle persuades her to encourage his affection, in the hope that being close to a son of Priam will protect against the hostility of the Trojans to the family of the traitor Calchas. Troilus' unrequited love is used as comic relief in an otherwise serious retelling of the Trojan War cycle. The character is portrayed as often indecisive and ineffectual as on the second page of this episode sample at the official site [...] It remains to be <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> Shanower will further develop the story.|$|E
500|$|Fans of {{the show}} speculated that Dylan would be paired with Nick's ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), to which Case responded by stating, [...] "Everybody’s speculating about Dylan, the new {{character}} coming to town but, all I can say is, I think it’s fun because it’s a hoot to speculate". Luke Kerr of Zap2it noted how fast Dylan met Sharon, and said they could potentially be a [...] "popular pairing with fans". Of working with Case, Burton stated: [...] "Sharon Case is actually very fun, and she makes me laugh. So half the time in scenes where I am laughing, I am really laughing at Sharon! [...] She has that personality where she makes me laugh." [...] He also noted that fans {{of the show}} on Twitter have <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> [...] "comfortable" [...] and [...] "easy" [...] the character's on-screen relationship is. Dylan later shares a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who was pregnant with Adam Newman's (Michael Muhney) child; she decides to pass the baby off as Dylan's, and the two later marry. Egan described the character's decision to keep the child's paternity a secret as a [...] "ticking time bomb". Burton stated that Dylan is [...] "not the sharpest tool in the shed", since he believed what Chelsea was telling him. When asked about the child, Burton said: [...] "This kid is everything to him, so once we figure out whose it is, if it’s not his, it’s {{not going to be}} a good situation for anybody."
