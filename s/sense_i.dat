500|$|Gaga had posted some of {{the lyrics}} of the song in February 2011, and next month she {{revealed}} more lyrics for [...] "Judas" [...] in the Google interview. Gaga also confirmed that the song {{was influenced by the}} Biblical Judas Iscariot. According to Popjustice, lyrically on the surface [...] "Judas" [...] is a song about being double-crossed and contemplating revenge, but being repeatedly drawn to awfulness. The middle eight of the song, with the lyrics [...] "But in the cultural <b>sense</b> <b>I</b> just speak in future tense. Judas kiss me if offenced, or wear an ear condom next time", talks about Gaga being beyond the ability to redeem herself, in terms of the traditional views of what a woman is supposed to be. [...] "But I don't want to redeem myself, because in the cultural <b>sense</b> <b>I</b> believe that I'm just before my time. And if you don't like it, wear an ear condom," [...] she explained. The main portion of the song is about Gaga in private and the middle eight is about Gaga in public, two themes that are explored elsewhere on the parent album too.|$|E

Leto became interested in percussions from the moment he and his brother started playing music together at early age, and his models were artists of many different mediums.

It just kind of made <b>sense.</b> <b>I</b> started playing on pots and pans at a very early age, so I just kind of flowed into it. It was just a natural progression." [...] He received his first drum kit when he was ten years old and began teaching himself, developing his own style.|$|E

500|$|Britten's early musical {{life was}} {{dominated}} by the classical masters; his mother's ambition was for him to become the [...] "Fourth B" [...] – after Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: [...] "Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I knew every note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of Fidelio for my fourteenth birthday... But I think in a <b>sense</b> <b>I</b> never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations". He developed a particular animosity towards Brahms, whose piano music he had once held in great esteem; in 1952 he confided that he played through all Brahms's music from time to time, [...] "to see if I am right about him; I usually find that I underestimated last time how bad it was!" ...|$|E

He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the <b>sense</b> <b>I</b> heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E

Gordon was disappointed in the episode, stating that it [...] "still qualifies {{as one of my}} biggest disappointments", ranking it as the worst episode of the first season. Glen Morgan felt that [...] "parts of the episode worked. What maybe fell a little flat is that we were a little too afraid of doing HAL and, in a <b>sense,</b> <b>I</b> think that's what the building needed; to have a scary personality." [...] James Wong had mixed feelings, saying that the episode [...] "had some neat stuff at the end...although I think the ending was a little unsatisfying to me visually, as well as in terms of how Mulder comes to dismember the machine. Overall a fun episode." [...] Chris Carter was more supportive of the episode, stating that the script addressed the question of what made up an X-File, and that it doesn't always have to be paranormal. He also felt positive about the episode's action scenes.|$|E

500|$|The Queen {{reportedly}} felt a [...] "profound {{sense of}} disappointment" [...] in Blair for breaking with protocol by revealing {{in his memoirs}} sensitive details of private conversations he had with her during his time as Prime Minister. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace told a newspaper, [...] "No prime minister before has ever done this and {{we can only hope}} that it will never happen again." [...] The Sunday Express claimed, quoting [...] "renowned Royal biographer Hugo Vickers" [...] and other [...] "Royal insiders", that because of the book's contents, ElizabethII would withhold granting Blair the Order of the Thistle, an honour which is bestowed at the sovereign's personal prerogative and normally given almost automatically to leaders of Scottish descent after leaving office. Gordon Brown was said to be [...] "seething" [...] and [...] "dismayed" [...] over the criticism he received from Blair in the book, but had told aides not to criticise it. Ed Balls, a Brown ally who served in his government as Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said, [...] "It would have been much better if the memoirs had been a celebration of success rather than recriminations. In that <b>sense</b> <b>I</b> thought it was all a bit sad. It was so one-sided. I didn't think it was comradely." ...|$|E

Walsh emphasized to Bloomberg BusinessWeek that edits which {{serve the interests of}} organizations are acceptable, but must be within the procedure of [...] "adding valuable context" [...] to articles. In a statement to The Wall Street Journal, Walsh said, [...] "This is about people reducing the hostility around the topic, and getting the articles back to a state where they make <b>sense.</b> <b>I</b> think the arbitration committee wants to send the message that Wikipedians have to be neutral on all accounts and all fronts. They don't take these situations lightly. They understand there's a perspective of: Are we censoring people or individuals? It's really about what can we do that's best for Wikipedia and the people who read it." [...] When asked by Ross Reynolds of National Public Radio affiliate KUOW-FM why the Arbitration decision included a [...] "ban on IP addresses at the Church of Scientology", Walsh answered, [...] "So the simple answer is that within looking at these computers and where these edits were coming from, the decision is that ultimately most of the edits within these ranges have been from single-user-accounts, people who have a single intention to change or move or in some cases remove information, which could be considered censorship, which is really something that doesn't work out well on Wikipedia. And this is an effort to kind of calm that effect, and to bring some neutrality and some quality back to these articles." ...|$|E
