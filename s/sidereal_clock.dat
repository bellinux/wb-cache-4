6000|$|Men can {{do nothing}} without the make-believe of a beginning. Even [...] science, the strict measurer, is obliged {{to start with a}} make-believe [...] unit, and must fix on a point in the stars' unceasing journey when his [...] <b>sidereal</b> <b>clock</b> shall pretend that time is at Nought. His less {{accurate}} [...] grandmother Poetry has always been understood to start in the middle; [...] but on reflection it appears that her proceeding is not very different [...] from his; since Science, too, reckons backward as well as forward, [...] divides his unit into billions, and with his clock-finger at Nought [...] really sets off in medias res. No retrospect will take us to [...] the true beginning; and whether our prologue be in heaven or on earth, [...] it is but a fraction of that all-presupposing fact with which our [...] story sets out.|$|E
5000|$|The decans ( [...] ; Egyptian bakiu) are 36 {{groups of}} stars (small constellations) {{used in the}} Ancient Egyptian astronomy. They rose {{consecutively}} on the horizon throughout each earth rotation. The rising of each decan {{marked the beginning of}} a new decanal [...] "hour" [...] (Greek hōra) of the night for the ancient Egyptians, and they were used as a <b>sidereal</b> star <b>clock</b> beginning by at least the 9th or 10th Dynasty (c. 2100 BCE).|$|R
50|$|An {{equatorial}} mount is a mount for {{instruments that}} compensate Earth's rotation by having one rotational axis {{parallel to the}} Earth's axis of rotation. This type of mount is used for astronomical telescopes and cameras. The advantage of an equatorial mount lies {{in its ability to}} allow the instrument attached to it to stay fixed on any celestial object with diurnal motion by driving one axis at a constant speed. Such an arrangement is called a <b>sidereal</b> or <b>clock</b> drive.|$|R
50|$|Smith Observatory and Dr. William R. Brooks House is a {{historic}} home and observatory located at Geneva in Ontario County, New York. Both structures were built in 1888. The observatory is a small frame building consisting of a two-story tower flanked by two small wings. The tower contains a 10 inch refracting telescope by Warner & Swasey of Cleveland, Ohio. The east wing contains an intact meridian transit telescope and <b>sidereal</b> pendulum <b>clock.</b> The house is a two-story brick dwelling with {{a broad range of}} intact, late Victorian eclectic features.|$|R

5000|$|Medieval clocks {{often used}} the 24-hour analog dial, {{influenced}} by the widespread example of the astrolabe. In Northern Europe, the double-XII system was preferred: two sets of the Roman numerals I to XII were used, {{one on the left}} side for the night and morning hours, and another set {{on the right side of}} the dial to represent the afternoon and evening hours. In Italy, the numbers from 1 to 24 (I to XXIV in Roman numerals) were used, leading to the widespread use of the 24-hour system in that country. On Italian clocks, though, the I was often shown at the right side of the dial, rather than the top. This probably reflects the influence of the Italian timekeeping system, which started counting the hours of the day at sunset or twilight.In northern Europe, the double XII system was gradually superseded during the 14th and 15th centuries by the single XII (12-hour system), leading to the widespread adoption of the 12-hour dial for popular use. The 24-hour analog dial continued to be used, but primarily by technicians, astronomers, scientists, and clockmakers. John Harrison, Thomas Tompion, and Mudge built a number of clocks with 24-hour analog dials, particularly when building astronomical and nautical instruments. 24-hour dials were also used on <b>sidereal</b> <b>clocks,</b> such as on this example by Charles Frodsham: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} {{in demand for}} channel capacity and the limitations in satellite power and frequency spectrum is leading to requirements for advanced multiple beam antenna systems with frequency reuse. The concept of the Olympus satellite evolved {{from the fact that}} new technologies and methods are to be explored for future satellites. The role of Olympus can be seen in both the development of earth station networks {{and at the same time}} the satellite requirements for the future satellites. It is a step between advanced transparent repeaters and the future intelligent satellite with on-board processing. A review of commercial and experimental satellites employed in the European region is given in the thesis. The services offered by these satellites and the access methods used are discussed with particular emphasis on business services. The new research work reported was done on the experiments related to the Olympus SS-TDMA payload. First a survey of commercial TDMA systems was performed and their capabilities discussed in detail for the SS-TDMA experimental application. The Olympus payload description and link budget analysis was performed in order to identify the size of the earth station required for these networks. The performance of the satellite link was simulated using BOSS software package together with some earlier simulation using the TOPSIM software package. The methods of BER estimation used are investigated and various results compared. These simulations covered most aspects of the RF (degradation due to TWTA non-linearity, fading, carrier spacing, co-channel interference) and some aspects of the baseband circuits. These simulation results have been compared with the experimental results and were found to be in close agreement. Thus giving confidence in the simulation methods used. In SS-TDMA the problem of acquisition and synchronisation is very important. In this respect the design of the acquisition and synchronisation unit (ASU) is discussed in detail. The resulting ASU was interfaced with the reference station of the commercial TDMA system for the first phase of the SS-TDMA experiments. Finally we present results of various network control methods for the SS-TDMA network, including the buffer requirement for the on-board clock control with the <b>sidereal</b> day <b>clock</b> correction. The ASU design, its interface to the reference TDMA terminal and successful operation with the reference station in acquiring and synchronising with the satellite switch provided the real time operation of the SS-TDMA scheme. The operation was conducted experimentally using the BTRL (British Telecom Research Labs) experimental earth station at Martlesham both in the "reference station loopback" and "reference station and traffic station" configuration via the the SS-TDMA switch. Full details of the experiments and comparison with systems simulations are presented in the thesis...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} measure the {{position}} of, for example, a star, the observer needs a <b>sidereal</b> <b>clock</b> {{in addition to the}} mural instrument. With the clock measuring time, a star of interest is observed with the instrument until it crosses an indicator showing that it is transiting the meridian. At this instant, the time on the clock is recorded as well as the angular elevation of the star. This yields the position in the coordinates of the instrument. If the instrument's arc is not marked relative to the celestial equator, then the elevation is corrected for the difference, resulting in the star's declination. If the <b>sidereal</b> <b>clock</b> is precisely synchronized with the stars, the time yields the right ascension directly.|$|E
50|$|A mean {{sidereal day}} is about 23 h 56 min 4.1 s in length. However, due to {{variations}} in the rotation rate of Earth, the rate of an ideal <b>sidereal</b> <b>clock</b> deviates from any simple multiple of a civil clock. In practice, the difference is kept track of by the difference UTC−UT1, which is measured by radio telescopes and kept on file and {{available to the public}} at the IERS and at the United States Naval Observatory.|$|E
5000|$|Soho House {{has been}} restored, {{retaining}} its 18th-century appearance, with [...] "fine collections of ormolu, silver, furniture and paintings". Of particular note are the displays {{of silver and}} ormolu which {{were made in the}} manufactory, and the ormolu <b>Sidereal</b> <b>clock</b> made by Boulton and Fothergill, in 1771-72. There is a Blue Plaque commemorating Matthew Boulton on the house. The garden, once over 100 acres in size but now less than half an acre, contains a walk with sphinxes, dated to around 1795. Part of the garden has been recreated using Boulton’s original planting notes.|$|E
50|$|This expedition, to {{determine}} 129° east on the ground, created worldwide scientific interest and involved {{the cooperation of}} the Astronomer Royal and the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, with wireless time signals sent by the French wireless Service, that were transmitted from the Lyons astronomical observatory (Observatoire de Lyon) at Saint-Genis-Laval, near Lyons, France, between 17 and 24 November 1920. Wireless time signals were also sent from the Adelaide Observatory, transmitted by the Adelaide Radio Station, to enable the beats of the Adelaide <b>sidereal</b> <b>clock</b> {{to be used as a}} control on the rate of the chronometer used for the boundary observation.|$|E
5000|$|In 1891 Goodsell Observatory was {{equipped}} with a 16.2 in telescope produced by the famous John Brashear of Pennsylvania. It was then the twelfth-largest refractor {{in the world and}} sixth-largest in the United States. The old observatory was made into a library and then torn down to make room for Laird Hall in 1905. The observatory acquired a <b>sidereal</b> <b>clock</b> in 1910. [...] In 1922 Carleton professor Edward Fath constructed one of the nation's first photoelectric photometers in Goodsell. The time service was continued until 1931 and the study of astronomy was prominent at Carleton well into the 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|Squire's {{proposals}} to determine longitude at sea drew on contemporary astronomy and other learned traditions, {{as well as}} heavily depending on her religious world view. Her books outlined a scheme that involved dividing the heavens into {{more than a million}} segments as well as a <b>sidereal</b> <b>clock</b> fixed to the position of the Star of Bethlehem at the birth of Jesus. Similarly religiously motivated searches were [...] "not uncommon" [...] at the time. The clock was intended to announce the time from church steeples, and she also discussed the use of marine buoys (described as artificial sea creatures) to aid mapping.|$|E
50|$|In 1971 Herbert Stark, who was HSS general {{secretary}} from 1966 to 1974, set-up a sub-committee, headed by Doug Daniels, {{to focus on}} the observatory's repair and maintenance. Civil Engineer Keith Hitchcock was appointed to look after the observatory building's renovation. In order to raise capital for the renovations some of the society's equipment was sold, including a vintage <b>sidereal</b> <b>clock,</b> which was a valuable antique. In addition to the renovation of the observatory's building, the Cooke telescope's mount was rebuilt by Terry Pearce, who, due to the observatories financial constraints, accepted payment in installments over a three year period.Doug Daniels succeeded Henry Wildey as Astronomical secretary following his retirement, and is the current president of the HSS.|$|E

50|$|A transit of Venus {{occurred}} on 8 December 1874 and 6 December 1882. The Transit of Venus Commission set up stations {{to observe the}} event. Durban was considered as a possible station but rejected because of tendency to cloudy weather in Natal during December season. Establishing an observatory in Durban was of interest to Harry Escombe, a local politician in the imperial government established by the British regime. David Gill, Astronomer Royal to the Cape, agreed and £350 voted by Corporation of Durban plus £500 by Legislative Council to found an observatory. A Grubb 8 inch aperture equatorial refracting telescope presented by Escombe and a 3 inch transit instrument was purchased by the government. A Dent <b>sidereal</b> <b>clock</b> was lent by the Venus Commission. Gill telegrammed Nevill to offer post of Government Astronomer, and Nevill sailed at 24 hours' notice on 27 October and arrived 27 November 1882.|$|E

40|$|Restricted Access. An {{improved}} {{version of}} a Precision Solar and <b>Sidereal</b> <b>Clock</b> designed and built in the Raman Research Institute, is described. For convenience in making Corrections against standard transmitted time signals, the actual time displayed (solar) is I. S. T. Special features of this improved version are: It provides 'Leap Second' facility, by which seconds can be added or omitted from 1. S. T. only without affecting the local sidereal time. The clock incorporates circuits which enable corrections of I. S. T. to coincide with standard time broadcasts, {{without the need for}} any external pulses. A 100 KHz signal is used for the divider chain which has improved the reliability of sidereal chain operation during power failures. In spite of using a lower frequency (100 KHz for both I. S.
