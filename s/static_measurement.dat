50|$|There {{are also}} critiques of this concept; field {{capacity}} is a <b>static</b> <b>measurement,</b> {{in a field}} it depends upon the initial water content {{and the depth of}} wetting before the commencement of redistribution and the rate of change in water content over time.

50|$|The {{particular}} surrogate data {{testing method}} {{to be used}} {{is directly related to}} the null hypothesis. Usually this is similar to the following:The data is a realization of a stationary linear system, whose output has been possibly measured by a monotonically increasing possibly nonlinear (but static) function. Here linear means that each value is linearly dependent on past values or on present and past values of some independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) process, usually also Gaussian. This is equivalent to saying that the process is ARMA type. In case of fluxes (continuous mappings), linearity of system means that it can be expressed by a linear differential equation. In this hypothesis, the <b>static</b> <b>measurement</b> function is one which depends only on the present value of its argument, not on past ones.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Static</b> <b>measurements</b> of {{position}} of the hindfoot and clinical assessment of motion of the hindfoot often {{are used in the}} assessment of foot function and manufacturing of orthoses. However, {{the reliability and validity of}} <b>static</b> <b>measurements</b> and dynamic observation and assessment of the hindfoot are controversial. The purpose of this investigation was to examine reliability of static and dynamic assessments of the hindfoot in a setting that reproduced clinical conditions. Methods: Twenty-four healthy participants were evaluated by four experienced clinicians for four commonly used <b>static</b> <b>measurements</b> and dynamic assessment of hindfoot function.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the {{identification}} of a single crack in a beam based on {{the knowledge of the}} damage-induced variations in the static deflection of the beam. The crack is simulated by an equivalent linear spring connecting the two adjacent segments of the beam. Sufficient conditions on <b>static</b> <b>measurements</b> which allow for the unique identification of the crack are presented and discussed. The inverse analysis provides exact closed-form expressions of position and severity of the crack as functions of deflection measurements for different boundary conditions. The theoretical results are confirmed by a comparison with <b>static</b> <b>measurements</b> on steel beams with a crack. Extension of the presented analysis to multiple cracks is briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|We analyse {{a mature}} {{numerical}} Fortran software library comparing its defect history against {{a wide variety}} of well-known static measure-ments searching for significant correlation. We found that most of these <b>static</b> <b>measurements</b> individually correlate moderately well {{with a high degree of}} significance with the number of defects in a particular component but principle component analysis reveals that defect pre-diction is influenced by most to some modest extent but no particular factor dominated. The analysis revealed a number of interesting prop-erties however including the existence of negative correlations which may suggest that programmers take more care in certain scenarios and less care in others. We go on to show that when <b>static</b> <b>measurements</b> are averaged across components, strong evidence of a logarithmic relationship with defect emerges...|$|R

The new GNSS permanent station is located in Idrija, so the sites of the fieldwork measurements were bound up with the problematic areas of Inner Carniola and a part of Upper Carniola. The sites were located in Gorenja vas, Žiri, Idrija and Črni Vrh. In these areas, the realization of the observations with the RTK measurement method and the processing of the observations of the GNSS <b>static</b> <b>measurement</b> were often problematic before the integration of the new permanent station because of larger distances from the permanent stations.

Lightweight structures are developed for this purpose, {{through the use}} of deployable and/or inflatable beams, and thin-film membranes. Their inherent properties (low mass and small thickness) preclude the use of conventional measurement methods (accelerometers and displacement transducers for example) during on-ground testing. In this context, innovative non-contact measurement methods need to be investigated for these stretched membranes.
