[...] Cost-benefit analysis was one tool used in the evaluation of safety design decisions accepted by the industry and the NHTSA. The analysis compared the cost of repairs to the societal costs for injuries and deaths related to fires in cases of vehicle rollovers for all cars sold in the US by all manufacturers. [...] The values assigned to serious burn injuries and loss of life were based on values calculated by NHTSA in 1972. [...] In the memo Ford estimated the cost of fuel system modifications to reduce fire risks in rollover events to be $11 per car across 12.5 million cars and light trucks (all manufacturers), for a total of $137 million. [...] The design changes were estimated to save 180 burn deaths and 180 serious injuries per year, a cost to society of $49.5 million.|$|E
