Using aluminum <b>suspension</b> <b>elements</b> and aluminum body panels, held together with a spot welding process and adhesive joining process developed specifically for this vehicle, the end result was a car that was 400 pounds lighter than a SHO Taurus. In 1995, Multimatic Motorsports entered one of these vehicles in the One Lap of America event, finishing 15th overall and 1st in the Mid-Priced Sedan class.|$|E
2500|$|Another unusual {{feature is}} the slanted {{overhang}} of the frontal part of the chassis which has {{the form of a}} pointed nose, ending in a high obliquely protruding steel spur. It had been designed for cutting through and crushing down German barbed wire, thus opening passages for following French infantry, originally seen as the primary function of the system. This long overhang could cause the tank to ditch itself readily. [...] The major dimensions of the tank are a length of , a width of [...] and a height of [...] The design is of the early so-called [...] "box tank" [...] type, in which the crew, propulsion system and all manner of equipment are not clearly separated. As a result, there is no real fighting compartment. The room available to the crew, illuminated by three small electric lights, is entered through a double door {{in the back of the}} tank and is extremely cramped. The crew consisted of a commanding officer who was also the driver; an NCO who was the gunner, two machine gunners, a loader who assisted both the cannon and the machine guns and a mechanic who doubled as a machine gun loader. Four of these six men had, at their assigned position, to crouch inside a [...] high space between the roof and the tank's floor. [...] They then had to stand within two narrow troughs, one, behind the driver's seat, used by the gunner and a second square one more to the back, between the <b>suspension</b> <b>elements,</b> used by the cannon loader and the two machine gunners. [...] Most of the space however, had a height of just three feet between the roof and the covering of transmission and suspension: if the mechanic wanted to assist the right machine gun, he had to lie on his belly to load it. Part of each Schneider tank team were also three embedded riflemen who functioned as a sort of outside crew, during battle directly accompanying the vehicle. [...] All-around protection was provided by 11.4mm steel plate, later improved by a spaced armour of 5.4/5.5mm, raising the weight from 12.5 to 13.5 tonnes. The roof had 5.5mm armour. [...] The plates are partly riveted; the superstructure is largely bolted.|$|E

30|$|Longitudinal {{suspension}} damping at secondary suspensions had a negligible {{effect on the}} tangent track response of the car body of a rapid transit vehicle.

The yaw motion between bogie and car body remains {{in a very small}} range of angular motion (≈ 10 ^- 3 rad), Fig. 7. The amplitudes of yaw motion are very small meaning that motion itself remains very small during tangent track analysis which leads to negligible effect of the longitudinal secondary suspension dampers on car body yaw motion.|$|R

50|$|All speaker {{drivers have}} {{a means of}} {{electrically}} inducing back-and-forth motion. Typically there is a tightly wound coil of insulated wire (known as a voice coil) attached to {{the neck of the}} driver's cone.

This cone, dome or other radiator is mounted to a rigid frame which supports a permanent magnet in close proximity to the voice coil.

Other typical components are a spider or damper, used as the rear <b>suspension</b> <b>element,</b> simple terminals or binding posts to connect the audio signal, and possibly a compliant gasket to seal the joint between the chassis and enclosure.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{the present}} paper, Fatigue life {{assessment}} of an anti-roll bar {{component of a}} passenger vehicle, is investigated by ANSYS 11 software. A stress analysis is also {{carried out by the}} finite element technique for the determination of highly stressed regions on the bar. Anti-roll bar is a <b>suspension</b> <b>element</b> used at the front, rear, or at both ends of a car that reduces body roll by resisting any unequal vertical motion between the pair of wheels to which it is connected. As a first stage, fatigue damage models proposed by some well-known references and the corresponding assumptions are discussed and some enhancements are proposed. Then, fracture analysis of an anti-roll bar of an automobile is carried out. The analysed type of the anti-roll bar is especially important as many cases are reported about the fracture after a 100, 000 km of travel fatigue and fracture conditions. This paper demonstrates fatigue life of an anti-roll bar and then evaluated by experimental analytically results from other researcher.

40|$|Suspension {{system is}} a type of {{structural}} equipment attached to the wheels of a vehicle for the purpose of reducing the effects of irregularities on road surfaces. This paper investigates the Magneto rheological (MR) suspension system in motorcycle and compares its advantages with the passive suspension system. Passive <b>suspension</b> <b>element</b> can only store and dissipate energy associated with local relative motion. Moreover its energy cannot be controlled as the suspension properties remain fixed at all time, unlike MR suspension which has the ability to overcome these drawbacks. The characteristic of the latter is related to micron-sized particles, typically iron, that forms particle chains, when appropriate electric field is applied. Two modelling approaches which are the Bouc-Wen model and Sim models, were used in this research. By comparing these two MR models and passive suspension system, it can be concluded that the Bouc-Wen model gives the best result. It is also shown that MR suspension systems reduce the displacement amplitude around 30 % whereas the time settling is reduced from 10 to 3 seconds, compared to the passive suspension system...|$|R
40|$|A 3 D printed {{electromagnetic}} {{vibration energy}} harvester is presented. The {{motion of the}} device is in-plane with the excitation vibrations, and this is enabled through the exploitation of a leaf isosceles trapezoidal flexural pivot topology. This topology is ideally suited for systems requiring restricted out-of-plane motion and benefits from being fabricated monolithically. This is achieved by 3 D printing the topology with materials having a low flexural modulus. The presented system has a nonlinear softening spring response, {{as a result of}} designed magnetic force interactions. A discussion of fatigue performance is presented and it is suggested that whilst fabricating, the raster of the <b>suspension</b> <b>element</b> is printed perpendicular to the flexural direction and that the experienced stress is as low as possible during operation, to ensure longevity. A demonstrated power of ~ 25 μW at 0. 1 g is achieved and 2. 9 mW is demonstrated at 1 g. The corresponding bandwidths reach up-to 4. 5 Hz.

5000|$|At {{the heart}} of the system, acting as {{pressure}} sink as well as <b>suspension</b> <b>elements,</b> are the so-called spheres, five or six in all; one per wheel and one main accumulator as well as a dedicated brake accumulator on some models.

The top is filled with nitrogen at high pressure, up to 75 bar, the bottom connects to the car's hydraulic fluid circuit. The high pressure pump, powered by the engine, pressurizes the hydraulic fluid (LHM) and an accumulator sphere maintains a reserve of hydraulic power. This part of the circuit is at between 150 and 180 bars. It powers the front brakes first, prioritised via a security valve, and depending on type of vehicle, can power the steering, clutch, gear selector, etc.|$|E
50|$|Fitting modern tires {{is also a}} {{suggestion}} to improve the handling. However, most modern tires may be much wider and have a lower profile than those used on classic cars when new, therefore they may interfere with <b>suspension</b> <b>elements</b> and the tire walls may become damaged. The suspension of a classic car may not be suitable for radial ply tyres, having been designed to only accommodate bias ply tires. Narrow classic car wheels may have been designed for narrow high-profile tube tires and not be suitable for modern tubeless radial tires. Another problem with modern tires on classic cars is that increased grip requires increased steering effort; many classic cars do not come with power steering. Many major tire companies have dedicated classic car tire marketing departments and {{will be able to}} give expert technical advice to address all these issues. It is important to know how radial tires will affect the performance of a car originally fitted with bias-ply tires, and the considerations needed to compensate for the differences.|$|E
