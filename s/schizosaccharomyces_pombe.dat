5|$|The fungi {{have several}} {{unicellular}} species, such as baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (<b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe).</b> Some fungi, {{such as the}} pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, can undergo phenotypic switching and grow as single cells in some environments, and filamentous hyphae in others.|$|E
5|$|Although MUS81 is a {{component}} of a minor crossover pathway in the meiosis of budding yeast, plants and vertebrates, in the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila, MUS81 appears {{to be part of}} an essential, if not the predominant crossover pathway. The MUS81 pathway also appears to be the predominant crossover pathway in the fission yeast <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are {{essential}} tools in biotechnology, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology. The yeasts brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (<b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe)</b> are important model organisms in science, {{since they are}} simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated. They are particularly valuable in genetics, genomics and proteomics, for example in protein production.|$|E
5|$|Several pivotal {{discoveries in}} biology {{were made by}} {{researchers}} using fungi as model organisms, that is, fungi that grow and sexually reproduce rapidly in the laboratory. For example, the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis was formulated by scientists using the bread mold Neurospora crassa to test their biochemical theories. Other important model fungi are Aspergillus nidulans and the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe,</b> each of which {{with a long history}} of use to investigate issues in eukaryotic cell biology and genetics, such as cell cycle regulation, chromatin structure, and gene regulation. Other fungal models have more recently emerged that address specific biological questions relevant to medicine, plant pathology, and industrial uses; examples include Candida albicans, a dimorphic, opportunistic human pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea, a plant pathogen, and Pichia pastoris, a yeast widely used for eukaryotic protein production.|$|E
25|$|Genes {{similar to}} ERCC4 with {{equivalent}} functions (orthologs) {{are found in}} other eukaryotic genomes. Some of the most studied gene orthologs include RAD1 in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and rad16+ in the fission yeast <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{species in}} the Schizosaccharomyces genus use L-malic acid, and enologists have been {{exploring}} the potential of using this wine yeast for deacidifying wines instead of the traditional route of malolactic fermentation with bacteria. However, early results with <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe</b> have shown a tendency of the yeast to produce off odors and unpleasant sensory characteristics in the wine. In recent years, enologists have been experimenting with a mutant strain of Schizosaccharomyces malidevorans that {{has so far been}} shown to produce less potential wine flaws and off odors.|$|E
25|$|Many fungi {{have low}} levels (0.1 to 0.5%) of {{cytosine}} methylation, whereas other fungi {{have as much}} as 5% of the genome methylated. This value seems to vary both among species and among isolates of the same species. There is also evidence that DNA methylation {{may be involved in}} state-specific control of gene expression in fungi. However, at a detection limit of 250 attomoles by using ultra-high sensitive mass spectrometry DNA methylation was not confirmed in single cellular yeast species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae or <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe,</b> indicating that yeasts do not possess this DNA modification.|$|E
25|$|Predictions of the QSER1 protein {{structure}} {{indicate that the}} protein contains many alpha helices. NCBI cBLAST predicted structural similarity between the QSER1 protein and the <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe</b> (fission yeast) RNA Polymerase II A chain. The two regions of similarity occur between amino acids 56-194 and 322-546. This first region (56-194) is a regulatory region in both the human and yeast RNA Polymerase II containing multiple repeats of the sequence YSPTSPSYS. Phosphorylation of serine residues in this region regulates progression through the steps of gene transcription. A 3D structure was provided for this region. The structurally similar region is on {{the exterior of the}} protein molecule and forms part of the DNA binding cleft.|$|E
25|$|Instead of yeast, {{bacteria}} play {{a fundamental}} role in malolactic fermentation {{which is essentially}} the conversion of malic acid into lactic acid. This has the benefit of reducing some of the tartness and making the resulting wine taste softer. Depending on the style of wine that the winemaker is trying to produce, malolactic fermentation may take place at the very same time as the yeast fermentation. Alternatively, some strains of yeast may be developed that can convert L-malate to L-lactate during alcohol fermentation. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain ML01 (S. cerevisiae strain ML01), which carries a gene encoding malolactic enzyme from Oenococcus oeni and a gene encoding malate permease from <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe.</b> S. cerevisiae strain ML01 has received regulatory approval in both Canada and the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} lifecycles {{of any of}} {{the species}} of Pneumocystis are not known, but presumably all resemble the others in the genus. The terminology follows zoological terms, rather than mycological terms, reflecting the initial misdetermination as a protozoan parasite. It is an extracellular parasite. All stages are found in lungs and because they cannot be cultured ex vivo, direct observation of living Pneumocystis is difficult. The trophozoite stage is thought to be equivalent to the so-called vegetative state of other species (such as <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe)</b> which, like Pneumocystis, belong to the Taphrinomycotina branch of the fungal kingdom. The trophozoite stage is single-celled and appears amoeboid (multilobed) and closely associated with host cells. Globular cysts eventually form that have a thicker wall. Within these ascus-like cysts, eight spores form which are released through rupture of the cyst wall. The cysts often collapse forming crescent-shaped bodies visible in stained tissue. If meiosis takes place within the cysts, or what the genetic status is of the various cell types is not known for certain.|$|E
25|$|The CLN3 gene was {{originally}} {{identified as the}} whi1-1 allele in a screen for small size mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (for Cln3's role in size control, see below). This screen {{was inspired by a}} similar study in <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe,</b> in which the Wee1 gene was identified as an inhibitor of cell cycle progression that maintained normal cell size. Thus, the WHI1 gene was at first thought to perform a size control function analogous to that of Wee1 in pombe. However, it was later found that WHI1 was in fact a positive regulator of Start, as its deletion caused cells to delay in G1 and grow larger than wild-type cells. The original WHI1-1 allele (changed from whi1-1 because it is a dominant allele) in fact contained a nonsense mutation that removed a degradation-promoting PEST sequence from the Whi1 protein and thus accelerated G1 progression. WHI1 was furthermore found to be a cyclin homologue, and it was shown that simultaneous deletion of WHI1—renamed CLN3—and the previously identified G1 cyclins, CLN1 and CLN2, caused permanent G1 arrest. This showed that the three G1 cyclins were responsible for controlling Start entry in budding yeast.|$|E

2500|$|Wee1 is {{a nuclear}} kinase {{belonging}} to the Ser/Thr family of protein kinases in the fission yeast <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe</b> (S. pombe). It has a molecular mass of 96kDa {{and it is a}} key regulator of cell cycle progression.|$|E
2500|$|Segregation of {{homologous}} chromosomes to opposite poles {{of the cell}} occurs during the first division of meiosis. [...] Proper segregation is essential for producing haploid meiotic products with a normal complement of chromosomes. [...] The formation of chiasmata (crossover recombination events) appears to generally facilitate proper segregation. [...] However, in the fission yeast <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe,</b> when chiasmata are absent, dynein promotes segregation. [...] Dhc1, the motor subunit of dynein, is required for chromosomal segregation in both the presence and absence of chiasmata. [...] The dynein light chain Dlc1 protein is also required for segregation, specifically when chiasmata are absent.|$|E
2500|$|Fungi {{also have}} a pathway {{reminiscent}} of mammalian JNK/p38 signaling. This is the Hog1 pathway: activated by high osmolarity (in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or {{a number of other}} abiotic stresses (in <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe).</b> The MAP2 kinase of this pathway is called Pbs2 (related to mammalian MKK3/4/6/7), the dedicated [...] MAP3 kinases involved in activation are Ssk2 and SSk22. The system in S. cerevisiae is activated by a sophisticated osmosensing module consisting of the Sho1 and Sln1 proteins, but it is yet unclear how other stimuli can elicit activation of Hog1. Yeast also displays a number of other MAPK pathways without close homologs in animals, such as the cell wall integrity pathway (Mpk1/Slt2) or the sporulation pathway (Smk1).|$|E
2500|$|The genome of {{the model}} plant Arabidopsis thaliana is capable of {{encoding}} 120 ABC proteins compared to 50-70 ABC proteins that are encoded by the human genome and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). [...] Plant ABC proteins are categorized in 13 subfamilies {{on the basis of}} size (full, half or quarter), orientation, and overall amino acid sequence similarity. Multidrug resistant (MDR) homologs, also known as P-glycoproteins, represent the largest subfamily in plants with 22 members and the second largest overall ABC subfamily. The B subfamily of plant ABC transporters (ABCBs) are characterized by their localization to the plasma membrane. Plant ABCB transporters are characterized by heterologously expressing them in Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe</b> (fission yeast), and HeLa cells to determine substrate specificity.|$|E
2500|$|Refermentation, {{sometimes}} called secondary fermentation, {{is caused by}} yeasts refermenting the residual sugar present within bottled wine. It occurs when sweet wines are bottled in non-sterile conditions, allowing the presence of microorganisms. The most common yeast to referment wine is the standard wine fermentation yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but has also been attributed to <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe</b> and Zygosaccharomyces bailii. The main issues associated with the fault include turbidity (from yeast biomass production), excess ethanol production (may violate labelling laws), slight carbonation, and some coarse odours. Refermentation can be prevented by bottling wines dry (with residual sugar levels <1.0g/L), sterile filtering wine prior to bottling, or adding preservative chemicals such as dimethyl dicarbonate. The Portuguese wine style known as [...] "vinhos verdes" [...] relies on this ...|$|E
2500|$|Cytokinesis. Cell {{division}} in animal cells and yeasts normally involves {{the separation of}} the parent cell into two daughter cells through the constriction of the central circumference. This process involves a constricting ring composed of actin, myosin, and α-actinin. In the [...] "fission yeast” <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe,</b> actin is actively formed in the constricting ring with the participation of Arp3, the formin Cdc12, profilin, and WASp, along with preformed microfilaments. Once the ring has been constructed the structure is maintained by a continual assembly and disassembly that, aided by the Arp2/3 complex and formins, is key to one of the central processes of cytokinesis. The totality of the contractile ring, the spindle apparatus, microtubules and the dense peripheral material is called the [...] "Fleming body» or [...] "intermediate body».|$|E
2500|$|Cell {{polarity}} factors positioned at {{the cell}} tips provide spatial cues to limit Cdr2 distribution {{to the cell}} middle. [...] In fission yeast <b>Schizosaccharomyces</b> <b>pombe</b> (S. Pombe), cells divide at a defined, reproducible size during mitosis because of the regulated activity of Cdk1. [...] The cell polarity protein kinase Pom1, {{a member of the}} dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase (DYRK) family of kinases, localizes to cell ends. [...] In Pom1 knockout cells, Cdr2 was no longer restricted to the cell middle, but was seen diffusely through half of the cell. [...] From this data it becomes apparent that Pom1 provides inhibitory signals that confine Cdr2 {{to the middle of the}} cell. [...] It has been further shown that Pom1-dependent signals lead to the phosphorylation of Cdr2. [...] Pom1 knockout cells were also shown to divide at a smaller size than wild-type, which indicates a premature entry into mitosis.|$|E
