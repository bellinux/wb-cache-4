Then {{you know how the}} cars look from the houses; which is not in the least as the houses look from the cars. Then, the very porter's brush in its nickel clip, the long cathedral-like aisle between the well-known green seats, the toll of the bell and the deep organ-like note of the engine wake up memories; and every sight, smell, and sound outside are like old friends remembering old days together. A piano-top buggy on a muddy, board-sidewalked street, all cut up by the narrow tires; the shingling at the corner of a veranda on a new-built house; a broken snake-fence girdling an old pasture of mulleins and skull-headed boulders; a wisp of Virginia creeper dying splendidly {{on the edge of a}} patch of corn; half a dozen panels of <b>snow-fence</b> above a cutting, or even a shameless patent-medicine advertisement, yellow on the black of a tobacco-barn, can make the heart thump and the eyes fill if the beholder have only touched the life of which they are part. What must they mean to the native-born? There was a prairie-bred girl on the train, coming back after a year on the Continent, for whom the pine-belted hills, with real mountains behind, the solemn loops of the river, and the intimate friendly farm had nothing to tell.|$|E
40|$|Question: What are the {{responses}} of Racomitrium lanuginosum moss to altered snow-lie and sheep use? Location: A Carex bigelowii-Racomitrium lanuginosum heath on a Scottish montane plateau affected since 1986 by a fenced ski corridor. Methods: Permanent quadrats were set up along transects 45 m long perpendicular to the <b>snow-fence.</b> Cover was assessed over a 12 -year period from 1990. Pellet-group clearance counts provided data on sheep usage between 1990 and 1996. Snow-lie was mapped in the springs of 1991 â€“ 1996. Results: The <b>snow-fence</b> created a gradient in sheep use and altered the duration of snow-lie. At the start of monitoring Racomitrium cover was lower immediately adjacent to the fence, and after 12 years its cover was significantly reduced within 10 m of the fence. Further away from the fence Racomitrium cover was relatively stable. The loss of Racomitrium was correlated both with increased snow-lie and heavier sheep usage. Grass cover increased near the fence and was related to sheep use. Dicranum fuscescens responded differently to Racomitrium, increasing significantly near the fence. Conclusions: We found that changes in snow-lie and grazing pressure quickly brought about vegetation change in this montane ecosystem. Racomitrium was the most sensitive species to the changes in grazing and snow-lie caused by the fence, having the biggest initial changes. Loss of Racomitrium permitted increases of species more resistant to grazing including Dicranum fuscescens and grasses...|$|E
40|$|Early in October 1949, the Division of Building Research was {{approached}} by the Director of Woodlands Research of the Pulp and Paper Research Institute of Canada and asked to test a recently-developed paper mesh <b>snow-fence.</b> The chief advantage of this fence {{is that it is}} considerably cheaper than the wood-slat type. As the member companies of the Pulp and Paper Resarch Institute make extensive use of snow fencing every winter, they were anxious to obtain a report of the performance of the paper mesh fence. This is a report on the performance of the paper mesh fence under test. Also published as a DBR Report T 4 Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
