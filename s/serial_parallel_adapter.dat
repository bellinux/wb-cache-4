Quantum-dot cellular automata has a simple cell as the basic element. The cell is used as a building block to construct gates, wires, and memories.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the description of}} the statics and velocity kinematics of <b>serial,</b> <b>parallel</b> and mobile robots, based on the fundamental concepts of twists and wrenches, reciprocity, the "selectively non-reciprocal screw," and "kinematic dualities.

Introduction All robotics textbooks describe the position and velocity kinematics as well as the statics of serial robots; only a few do the same thing for either parallel or mobile robots; no single textbook presents all three types of systems with the same level of detail. Moreover, the treatments of these three types of robot systems are, at first sight, quite different. This often gives students the false impression that <b>serial,</b> <b>parallel</b> and mobile robots require fundamentally different kinematical concepts [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an efficient kinematical {{solution to a}} multi-robot system with <b>serial</b> and <b>parallel</b> mechanisms. JL-I is a reconfigurable robot featuring active spherical joints formed by <b>serial</b> and <b>parallel</b> mechanisms endowing the robotic system with the ability of changing shapes in three dimensions. The active joint here can combine {{the advantages of the}} high rigidity of a parallel mechanism and the extended workspace of a serial mechanism. However, the kinematic analysis of the <b>serial</b> and <b>parallel</b> mechanism is always the bottleneck in designing a robot and control realization. In order to deal with this problem, the whole kinematical analysis is organized in the sequence from the direct mechanical analysis related to the <b>serial</b> and <b>parallel</b> mechanism over the numerical solutions to the simplified kinematics expression. The latest results obtained demonstrate that the deduced closure-form solution is time efficient and easy to implement while offering a satisfactory motion performance in on-site experiments.
