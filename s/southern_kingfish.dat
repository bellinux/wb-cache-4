5000|$|The [...] "Brava" [...] {{beach is}} usually {{preferred}} {{in the morning}} and at noon in the summer, while in the afternoon the wind usually blows east and swimmers move to the [...] "Mansa" [...] beach and to the rocks around the west side of Punta Colorada, where there are natural sandy pools sheltered from the wind. Brava beach is good for fishing large croaker (February-March), brótolas (August to December), <b>southern</b> <b>kingfish</b> (all year), and mackerel (in winter). Unlike the Playa Brava of Punta del Este, which has dangerous currents, this beach is much safer, although there are days with very big waves that can be dangerous. During the summer high season, there is a lifeguard service and public restrooms. Sand sports (football, volleyball, etc.) are better suited for the [...] "Mansa" [...] beach.|$|E
40|$|Today, {{ocean and}} coastal marine {{resource}} management is extremely complex. Marine resource managers {{are charged with}} conserving and managing many diverse species. <b>Southern</b> <b>kingfish</b> (Menticirrhus americanus), commonly known as whiting, are found from southern New England to Florida. During the fall through winter, western North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) are primarily found in the coastal nearshore waters off South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, overlapping the whiting's range and habitat. In January 2006, a right whale calf was discovered dead, {{as a result of}} gillnet entanglement, in close proximity to the Florida commercial whiting fishing grounds; thus, to assist the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) with developing appropriated right whale conservation management measures, this study evaluated the newly established commercial Florida whiting fishery. Findings revealed that the whiting fishery was established in 2004 and the fishery was prosecuted during the time and area where right whales were found. Moreover, the study found that whiting landings, market value, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), dealers, and fishing effort significantly increased during 2000 through 2005. As a result of the right whale calf mortality and threat of gillnet gear to whales, the NMFS prohibited the use of gillnet gear in the US southeastern waters, which inevitably closed the newly established whiting fishery.

40|$|Recent {{emphasis}} on ecosystem approaches to fisheries management renews interest in, {{and the need}} for, trophic information about fish communities. A program was started in 1980 at the National Marine Fisheries Service Galveston Laboratory to develop a trophic database for continental shelf fishes. Collections were made during 1982 - 1983 that were processed but never published, yet the data remain valid today for historical purposes and for delimiting food web components within ecosystem assessments. I examined spring, summer, and fall foods in offshore populations of nine common species of trawl-susceptible fishes, with particular reference to predation on commercial penaeid shrimps (Farfantepenaeus and Litopenaeus). Diets were evaluated with the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) which combines the occurrence, number, and weight of each food item. Bank sea bass (Centropristis ocyurus) and bighead searobin (Prionotus tribulus) primarily consumed crabs, more so by larger than smaller fish. Inshore lizardfish (Synodus foetens) was almost entirely piscivorous. Ocellated flounder (Ancylopsetta ommata) consumed fishes, crabs, and stomatopods. Dwarf sand perch (Diplectrum bivittatum), blackwing searobin (Prionotus rubio), rock sea bass (Centropristis philadelphica), <b>southern</b> <b>kingfish</b> (Menticirrhus americanus), and red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) fed mainly on shrimps. Most fish diets varied with respect to size (age), time of day, area sampled, depth, or season. Rimapenaeus and Sicyonia were the most frequently identified shrimp genera - only five Farfantepenaeus and no Litopenaeus were identified in almost 4, 300 fish stomachs. I also examined gonadal development and documented fish length-weight relationships. Ripe gonads were most frequently found during summer in dwarf sand perch, during fall in ocellated flounder and bighead searobin, and during spring for other species, except no ripe red snapper or bank sea bass were collected. Rock sea bass {{was found to be}} a protogynous hermaphrodite, while dwarf sand perch is a synchronous hermaphrodite. Only ocellated flounder and <b>southern</b> <b>kingfish</b> exhibited sex-related differences in length-weight relationships. (PDF contains 40 pages. ...|$|E
40|$|Population {{structure}} and reproductive {{aspects of the}} <b>southern</b> <b>kingfish</b> Menticirrhus americanus in Santa Catarina northern coast were investigated. Trawl nets {{were used for the}} monthly surveys between October (2003) and September (2004). A total of 425 individuals between 4. 2 and 31. 8 cm (mean 12. 7 ± 5. 7) were analyzed, and the majority of the individuals (4. 2 to 12. 5 cm) was captured mainly in summer, autumn and winter, while larger individuals were captured in spring. Females of all size classes were predominant during summer and winter, and weight/length relationship showed significant differences between sexes and a positive alometric growth for the species. The size at first maturity (L 50) was estimated in 16. 7 cm for females and 15. 4 cm for males. The reproductive period occurred in warm seasons, and M. americanus showed multiple spawning. The hepatossomatic index demonstrated a similar seasonal pattern as the gonadosomatic index, and was a good indicator of the spawning. The condition factor wasn’t a good indicator of the spawning period, but it was related with the recovery process and gonad maturation. Characteristics of the population dynamic showed that M. americanus utilizes the study area for reproduction and recruitment...|$|E
40|$|Parvalbumins are low {{molecular}} weight, water soluble sarcoplasmic proteins {{that are found}} in abundance in the fast twitch muscles of fish and amphibia. They are further characterized by a high affinity for calcium, acidic nature, polymorphism, unusual amino acid composition, unique ultraviolet absorption spectrum and high antigenicity. Parvalbumins are believed {{to serve in the}} rapid removal of calcium ions from troponin C during the relaxation phase of fast twitch muscle. Parvalbumins are species-specific for each species of fish in terms of these physico-chemical characteristics. In view of this specificity and of the protein's considerable antigenicity, it was proposed to employ the parvalbumin from red drum (Sciaenops ocellata) as the basis for an immunological field test to identify the red drum species from muscle samples. The ability to identify red drum from only a sample of muscle tissue would allow game law enforcement personnel to screen contraband fish fillets on site. A field test as described would greatly strengthen enforcement efforts of parks and wildlife personnel. The major component parvalbumins were isolated from red drum and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography, and antisera were produced in two rabbits against the red drum parvalbumin. This antisera was then examined for cross-reactivity against the parvalbumin from spotted seatrout and against the myogens of the following species of fish: sand seatrout (Cynoscion arenarius), black drum (Pogonias cromis), <b>southern</b> <b>kingfish</b> (Menticirrhus americanus), freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens), vermillion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens), sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus) and southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma). The antisera were examined by double diffusion in gels, by interfacial ring testing, and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In double diffusion in gels, the anti-red drum parvalbumin antiserum reacted specifically with its homologous antigen when the antiserum used was the five-week post primary inoculation antiserum. As the antiserum matured, following secondary and tertiary inoculations with antigen, the specificity lessened and the antiserum reacted in varying degrees with the heterologous antigens. With ELISA, reactivity of the antiserum was demonstrated against all antigens tested, regardless of the stage of the antiserum...|$|E
