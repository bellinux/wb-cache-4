5|$|On January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican <b>Scott</b> <b>Brown</b> {{was elected}} to the Senate in a special {{election}} to replace Kennedy, having campaigned on giving the Republican minority the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters.

5|$|Incumbent Republican Senator <b>Scott</b> <b>Brown</b> ran for {{re-election}} to a first full term. He {{had been elected}} in a special election in 2010 {{following the death of}} incumbent Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy. Brown faced no challengers from his own party. For the Democrats, an initial wide field of prospective candidates narrowed after the entry of Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren, the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Warren clinched near-unanimous party support, with {{all but one of the}} other Democratic candidates withdrawing following her entrance. After winning her party's nomination, eliminating any need for a primary, she faced Brown in the general election.|$|E
5|$|Kilmarnock manager Bobby Williamson {{was then}} hired, but he {{proved to be}} unpopular with Hibs supporters.

Williamson departed {{near the end of}} that season to manage Plymouth Argyle and was replaced by Tony Mowbray. Mowbray promised fast-flowing, passing football, with which Hibs finished third in his first season as manager, while Mowbray won the SFWA Manager of the Year award.|$|E
