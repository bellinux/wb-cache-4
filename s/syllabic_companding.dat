40|$|Abstract—An {{inherent}} characteristic of most translinear (TL) filters is instantaneous companding. This brief describes a distortionless <b>syllabic</b> <b>companding</b> TL filter {{based on the}} “analog floating-point technique” [1]. Through {{the addition of a}} compensation current to each of the capacitances in the filter, distortion is eliminated. By applying <b>syllabic</b> <b>companding</b> to a TL filter, the input current can be much larger than the quiescent current, thus increasing the dynamic range.

40|$|In {{order to}} get a better {{understanding}} on the concepts of dynamic eigenvalues and dynamic eigenvectors as presented in [1], the steadystate behaviour of the state variables of the filter with <b>syllabic</b> <b>companding</b> described in [2] is determined. For that purpose, the approach presented in [3] is used. Some comments are made regarding the general form of the solution of the Riccati equation involved in the procedure described in [3] and it is proven that the selection of the initial condition required for determining a valid solution which could be used to determine the exact dynamics of the filter is not arbitrary. Besides the computations of the steady-state response of the state variables, the determination of the Floquet exponents assuming that the state equations of the filter are periodic support the hypothesis stated above.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} enhancement of the dynamic range per unit power con-sumption of analog filters using dynamic biasing. A technique for realizing dynami-cally biased log-domain filters while maintaining input-output linearity is presented. This method is much simpler than previously known techniques for realizing large dynamic range filters using <b>syllabic</b> or instantaneous <b>companding.</b> The consequent advantages of the proposed technique are pointed out. In order to demonstrate {{the capabilities of the}} proposed dynamically-biased log-domain filters, a third-order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 1 MHz is de-signed in a 0. 25 µm BiCMOS technology. Circuit techniques to ensure proper operation of the filter over a wide range of input currents are presented. With suitable dynamic bias-ing, the fabricated filter can maintain a THD 53. 7 dB for differential input current amplitudes ranging from 3 µA to 2. 5 mA (a range of 58. 4 dB). In terms of the range of signals that can be handled, the performance is equivalent to that of a conven-tional filter with a maximum signal to noise ratio of 112 dB. The filter draws 575 µW from a 2. 5 V supply in the quiescent condition and 26. 1 mW with the maximum input amplitud...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a median-rate speech coder, the {{controlled}} adaptive prediction delta modulation coder (CAPDM), which operates at 16 kb/s with good speech quality and low algorithm complexity [15]. The coder is dedicated to personal communication network (PCN) applications and transmits speech samples {{on the basis of}} packets. It combines the features of one-step looking forward decision, <b>syllabic</b> <b>companding,</b> instan-taneous companding, and adaptive prediction. In addition to the use of a short-term prediction filter, CAPDM also exploits the pitch property to predict speech waveform explicitly. With the aid of a pitch prediction filter, the performance of a CAPDM codec improves about 3 dB in segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SEGSNR). The average SEGSNR of CAPDM. FF is about 21 dB, which is 7 dB over traditional CVSD at 16 kb/s. We also utilize an adaptive postfilter (APF) to enhance the perceptual quality of the decoded speech. The mean opinion score (MOS) listening test of CAPDM. FF with APF shows that its average score achieves 4. 19, which is as good as G. 728 16 -kb/s LD-CELP and is comparable with CCITT G. 721 32 -kb/s ADPCM. The complexity of CAPDM. FF is evaluated to be 8 MIPS, which is much lower than that of LD-CELP and could be further reduced by adopting a smaller correlation window for pitch detection. To solve the problem of packet loss, we developed a packet-based waveform substitution method by reinitializing the codec parame-ters {{at the beginning of each}} packet. The simulation results show that CAPDM. FF could tolerate 5 % of packet loss and still keep an SEGSNR at 10 dB and an MOS at about 3. 0.
