40|$|In {{wideband}} {{code division}} multiple access (WCDMA) cellular systems, the coverage radius of a cell depends on its current capacity level. As a result, existing WCDMA radio network dimensioning approaches require that coverage and capacity planning be carried out jointly in an iterative manner in order to obtain the minimum <b>site</b> <b>count</b> needed while fulfilling both coverage and capacity requirements. This requires relatively long computational time, particularly when there are many scenarios or what-if cases to be considered. To overcome this problem, we propose an alternative radio network dimensioning approach where coverage planning and capacity planning can be carried out separately to reduce computational time. Besides, a portion of the values calculated in the initial iteration is preserved in a lookup graph, allowing future what-if analysis to be accomplished rapidly. Simulation results show that, unlike the existing approach, the planning and what-if analysis times of the proposed dimensioning approach are independent of the number of sce-narios considered. Lastly, we present a few case studies and show that the proposed dimensioning method can give the same prediction accuracy as the existing method...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{recording}} technologies now {{allow us}} to record populations of neurons simultaneously, data necessary to understand the network dynamics of the brain. Extracellular probes are fabricated with ever greater numbers of recording sites to capture the activity of increasing numbers of neurons. However, the utility of this extracellular data is limited by an initial analysis step, spike sorting, that extracts the activity patterns of individual neurons from the extracellular traces. Commonly used spike sorting methods require manual processing that limits their scalability, and errors can bias downstream analyses. Leveraging the replication of the activity from a single neuron on nearby recording sites, we designed a spike sorting method consisting of three primary steps: (1) a blind source separation algorithm to estimate the underlying source components, (2) a spike detection algorithm to find the set of spikes from each component best separated from background activity and (3) a classifier to evaluate if a set of spikes came from one individual neuron. To assess the accuracy of our method, we simulated multi-electrode array data that encompass many of the realistic variations and the sources of noise in in vivo neural data. Our method was able to extract individual simulated neurons in an automated fashion without any errors in spike assignment. Further, the number of neurons extracted increased as we increased recording <b>site</b> <b>count</b> and density. To evaluate our method in vivo, we performed both extracellular recording with our close-packed probes and a co-localized patch clamp recording, directly measuring one neuron’s ground truth set of spikes. Using this in vivo data we found that when our spike sorting method extracted the patched neuron, the spike assignment error rates were {{at the low end}} of reported error rates, and that our errors were frequently the result of failed spike detection during bursts where spike amplitude decreased into the noise. We used our in vivo data to characterize the extracellular recordings of burst activity and more generally what an extracellular electrode records. With this knowledge, we updated our spike detector to capture more burst spikes and improved our classifier based on our characterizations...|$|E
40|$|The Leidenfrost effect {{influences}} substantially {{the contact}} of a liquid droplet {{with a hot}} surface. Contact between the liquid and solid is crucial for cooling applications such as fire-fighting, hot-mill steel rolling, thermal power plants and microprocessor cooling. In automotive or aerospace internal combustion engines, the combustion chamber is pressurized prior to ignition. Despite various effects of elevated pressure, the combustion process needs to be controlled. The reaction time in a combustion chamber is limited, but mixture preparation involves prior evaporation. Fuel in contact with a combustion chamber wall evaporates in a uncontrolled manner. Furthermore, the fuel reacts with lubricants and decomposes into coke residue. The fundamental physics of the Leidenfrost effect are yet to be fully understood. This applies especially {{to the influence of}} pressure on the Leidenfrost effect. For the question, if injected water droplets would stay in contact with the heated combustion chamber wall, current models would need to be extrapolated from ambient pressure, although there is no validation experiment available. This experimental study addresses the influence of elevated pressure on the Leidenfrost effect, providing observations and measurements suitable to validate theories, hence extending the knowledge about the Leidenfrost effect. The experiment is implemented inside a pressure chamber and results for single water droplets impinging onto a hot aluminium substrate are presented. The droplet impingement Weber number was 5. The experiments were conducted at chamber pressures from 1 to 25 bar (0. 1 to 2. 5 MPa) and wall temperatures from 100 to 460 °C (373 to 733 K). Based on video observations, phenomenological boiling states are identified and mapped on a pressure-temperature diagram. The various states of impact behaviour shift to higher temperatures with increasing pressure. Nucleate boiling and critical temperature models of the bulk liquid serve as the lower and the upper bounds for the transition for all observed states of droplets, respectively. A new nucleation model, accounting for the fluid flow inside the impacting droplet, agrees reasonably well with experimental results for the nucleate boiling in the experiment. All previous theories and correlations predict transition temperatures which are constant or deviate from experimental values at elevated pressures. Therefore, the theoretical part of this study tests refined hypotheses for transition from nucleate boiling to film boiling. A Landau instability model and a bubble percolation model propose explanations for transitions in the boiling phenomena, but these models deviate from experimental results. Refinement of these approaches is still needed with respect to the characteristic length of instability and the active nucleation <b>site</b> <b>count.</b> The experimentally observed onset of the transition state exhibits a linearity between the reduced pressure value and the reduced contact overheat. The boiling states are further quantified with the measurement of the residence time upon the target. In the wetting state at ambient pressure, the residence time is equal to the evaporation time of the droplets. Residence time is lower for the transition and the Leidenfrost rebound states. The droplet detaches from the surface prior to complete evaporation. Residence time thresholds mark the observed transition state. Asymptotic rebound time marks the rebound state. The time thresholds follow the state borders in the pressure-temperature map. Secondary droplets are detected with the shadowgraph technique. Characterization of the secondary droplets has been achieved using a new image processing algorithm. It is based on the irradiance model of a semi infinite screen. The Sauter mean diameter of the secondary droplets in transition boiling state increases with increasing pressure. An increasing trend of the Sauter mean diameter of secondary droplets to the bubble departure diameter was observed...|$|E

Until now, three counts have been organised, always {{at the end of}} January- beginning of February. We received data from 25 different roost sites but some of these were not visited at all three counts. The total number of counted gulls varied between 166, 522 in 2001 (15 roost <b>sites</b> <b>counted)</b> and 249, 557 in 2002 (20 roost <b>sites</b> <b>counted).</b> Bringing some gaps into account, we can assume that the number of wintering gulls in Flanders can exceed 300, 000 birds. During all counts, Black-headed Gull Larus ridibundus was the most numerous species (max. 126, 513), followed by Common Gull Larus canus (max. 92. 432) and Herring Gull Larus argentatus (max. 17. 822). Because not all roost sites along the coast have been counted, the numbers of Lesser Black-backed Gull Larus fuscus and Greater Black-backed Gull Larus marinus were relatively small. Only two roost sites held more than 20, 000 gulls on average: the water reservoirs at Woumen-Merkem (70, 026 gulls) and at Kluizen (33, 668 gulls). Beside these water reservoirs (good for 48 % of all gulls counted), also harbour areas (28 %) and sand pits (18 %) were favourite roost site habitats. Natural habitats as salt marshes and flooded grasslands were less important.
