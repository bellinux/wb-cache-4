25|$|Other bees like Trigona corvina rely on pheromones {{for much}} of their {{communication}} with nest mates and rivals. They produce pheromones from their labial glands. The function of signaling depends on the profitability, but they commonly will scent mark a food source either for self-orientation, to deter rivals or to direct a nest mate to the resource. Once an individual finds a good food source, they {{will return to the}} same source for many days. If an individual detects the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rival bee, they will avoid the plant in order to avoid conflict and to save time. It has also been shown that pheromones are a method of sexual selection between male drones and queens.|$|E
40|$|Sperm {{competition}} {{occurs when}} 2 or more males copulate {{with a particular}} female during the same reproductive cycle, and their sperm compete to fertilize the female's available eggs. One strategy that male voles use to assess the risk and intensity of sperm competition involves responding to the presence <b>of</b> <b>scent</b> marks <b>of</b> conspecific males found near a sexually receptive female. Previously, we have shown that if a male vole copulated with a female {{while he was in}} the presence of the odors of another male he increased his sperm investment relative to his investment if another male's odors were not present. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that males assess differences in the relative quality of competing males and adjust their sperm investment accordingly. We did so by allowing males to copulate when they were exposed to the <b>scent</b> mark <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 24 -h food-deprived male (low-quality male) or the <b>scent</b> mark <b>of</b> <b>a</b> male that was not food deprived (high-quality male). The data indicate that male meadow voles did not increase their sperm investment during copulation when exposed to the <b>scent</b> mark <b>of</b> <b>a</b> food-deprived male but did so when they were exposed to the <b>scent</b> mark <b>of</b> <b>a</b> male that was not food deprived. The results support the hypothesis that male voles are able to adjust sperm investment when they encounter the <b>scent</b> marks <b>of</b> males that differ in quality.

Evidence also was found to suggest that body rubs are used to acquire odors deposited by leg lifts...|$|R
