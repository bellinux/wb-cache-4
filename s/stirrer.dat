However under the same conditions, a potentiometric method for the detection of the equivalence point can yield accurate results without difficulty. The electrical apparatus required consists of a potentiometer or pH meter with a suitable indicator and reference electrode. The other apparatus consists of a burette, beaker and <b>stirrer.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{microwave}} ovens, the waveguide {{leads to}} a radio frequency-transparent port into the cooking chamber. As the fixed dimensions of the chamber, and its physical closeness to the magnetron, would normally create standing wave patterns in the chamber, a motorized fan-like <b>stirrer</b> {{is placed in the}} waveguide to randomize the pattern. This is not always effective for larger objects in the chamber, and most modern microwave ovens also include a rotating table for the food to sit on, called a turntable.|$|E
25|$|The {{other main}} {{environmental}} factors affecting cellulose production are pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. According to experimental studies, the optimal temperature for maximum production was between 28 and 30°C. For most species, the optimal pH was between 4.0-6.0. Controlling pH {{is especially important}} in static cultures as the accumulation of gluconic, acetic, or lactic acid decreases the pH far lower than the optimal range. Dissolved oxygen content can be varied with <b>stirrer</b> speed as it is needed for static cultures where substrates need to be transported by diffusion.|$|E
25|$|Uneven heating in microwaved {{food can}} be {{partly due to}} the uneven {{distribution}} of microwave energy inside the oven, and {{partly due to the}} different rates of energy absorption {{in different parts of the}} food. The first problem is reduced by a <b>stirrer,</b> a type of fan that reflects microwave energy to different parts of the oven as it rotates, or by a turntable or carousel that turns the food; turntables, however, may still leave spots, such as the center of the oven, which receive uneven energy distribution. The location of dead spots and hot spots in a microwave can be mapped out by placing a damp piece of thermal paper in the oven. When the water saturated paper is subjected to the microwave radiation it becomes hot enough to cause the dye to be released which will provide a visual representation of the microwaves. If multiple layers of paper are constructed in the oven with a sufficient distance between them a three-dimensional map can be created. Many store receipts are printed on thermal paper which allows this to be easily done at home.|$|E
500|$|Jay Cocks of TIME {{magazine}} {{offered a}} mixed review, stating [...] "or all its sass, {{there is something}} a little too careful about this album: the rhythms are too studied and studiobound, the sexiness slightly forced. It's as if Jackson, aware that this was her premier effort under a new, $40 million record deal, felt weighed down by the burden of proving herself. When, however, she kicks loose on What'll I Do, a nifty, '60s-style soul <b>stirrer,</b> it's clear that Jackson's got nothing to prove to anyone, including herself." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times compares Jackson to her brother Michael and Madonna, stating [...] "Jackson's real strength, abetted by Jam and Lewis, is the way she tops dance-club rhythms with pop melodies. Less up-to-the-second than Madonna but still effective, the Jackson team has obviously {{been listening to the}} competition. Madonna's 'Justify My Love' echoes in 'That's the Way Love Goes,' and 'If' resembles Michael Jackson's 'Why You Wanna Trip on Me,' starting with screaming guitar and a chanted verse, rising to a sweet melody." [...] He also comments that despite its shortcomings, [...] "he album's not about being real; it's about seamlessness and ingenuity, about giving the public something it can use. For a superstar, Jackson is downright selfless, but she gets the job done." ...|$|E

Living in San Francisco, California, Epperson had left a fruit drink out overnight, with a <b>stirrer</b> in it, thus making it freeze. In 1923, Epperson got a patent on his [...] "frozen ice on a stick". Epperson also invented the twin ice pop, with two sticks so it could be shared by two children.

And when a man--not being sea-sick--has once discovered that the apparent heel of the ship in rolling is at least four times less than it looks, and that she will jump upright again in a quarter of a minute like a fisher's float; has learnt to get his trunk out from under his berth, and put it back again, by jamming his forehead against the berth-side and his heels against the ship's wall; has learnt--if he sleep aft--to sleep through the firing of the screw, though it does shake all the marrow in his backbone; and has, above all, made a solemn vow to shave and bathe every morning, let the ship be as lively as she will: then he will find a full gale a finer tonic, and a finer <b>stirrer</b> of wholesome appetite, than all the drugs of Apothecaries' Hall.|$|E
6000|$|... 'His [the King's] implacability [towards {{the family}} of Douglas] did also appear in his {{carriage}} towards Archibald of Kilspinke, whom he, {{when he was a}} child, loved singularly well for his ability of body, and was wont to call him his Gray-Steill. [12] Archibald, being banished into England, could not well comport with the humor of that nation, which he thought to be too proud, and that they had too high a conceit of themselves, joined with a contempt and despising of all others. Wherefore, being wearied of that life, and remembering the King's favor of old towards him, he determined to try the King's mercifulness and clemency. So he comes into Scotland, and taking occasion of the King's hunting in the park at Stirling he casts himself to be in his way, as he was coming home to the Castle. So soon as the King saw him afar off, ere he came near, he guessed it was he, and said to one of his courtiers, [...] "Yonder is my Gray-Steill, Archibald of Kilspindie, if he be alive." [...] The other answered that it could not be he, and that he durst not come into the King's presence. The King approaching, he fell upon his knees and craved pardon, and promised from thenceforward to abstain from meddling in public affairs, and to lead a quiet and private life. The King went by without giving him any answer, and trotted a good round pace up the hill. Kilspindie followed, and though he wore on him a secret, or shirt of mail, for his particular enemies, was as soon at the Castle gate as the King. There he sat him down upon a stone without, and entreated some of the King's servants for a cup of drink, being weary and thirsty; but they, fearing the King's displeasure, durst gave him none. When the King was set at his dinner, he asked what he had done, what he had said, and whither he had gone? It was told him that he had desired a cup of drink, and had gotten none. The King reproved them very sharply for their discourtesy, and told them that if he had not taken an oath that no Douglas should ever serve him, he would have received him into his service, for he had seen him sometime a man of great ability. Then he sent him word to go to Leith, and expect his further pleasure. Then some kinsman of David Falconer, the cannonier, that was slain at Tantallon, began to quarrel with Archibald about the matter, wherewith the King showed himself not well pleased when he heard of it. Then he commanded him to go to France for a certain space, till he heard further from him. And so he did, and died shortly after. This gave occasion to the King of England (Henry VIII.) to blame his nephew, alleging the old saying, That a king's face should give grace. For this Archibald (whatsoever were Angus's or Sir George's fault) had not been principal actor of anything, nor no counsellor nor <b>stirrer</b> up, but only a follower of his friends, and that noways cruelly disposed' (Hume of Godscroft, ii. 107)." ...|$|E

The lower the viscosity of the slurry the faster the <b>stirrer</b> will fall to the bottom. That is why more sprouted grain results in a lower Falling Number as Falling Number is the time it takes the <b>stirrer</b> to fall to the bottom.|$|E
