40|$|Successional {{changes of}} pine forests were studied in outwash areas characterised by {{topography}} with ridges and depressions. The spatial series of pine forests of different stand ages {{and those that}} have not experienced the impact of human activities were analyzed. Pine forests in outwash areas form two <b>successional</b> <b>series</b> depending on the different ecotopes. The following <b>successional</b> <b>series</b> occurs at the tops of ridges: boreal green moss pine forest à boreal green moss – dwarf shrub forests à boreo-nemoral pine forest with admixture of birch, oak, spruce à nemoral polydominant spruce broad-leaved forest. Another <b>successional</b> <b>series</b> is formed on gentle ridge slopes: boreal polytric pine forest à boreal bilberry-polytric pine forest à boreo-nemoral pine forest with admixture of birch, oak, spruce à nemoral polydominant spruce broad-leaved forest. We show that ecotope has the {{leading role in the}} organisation of cenoses at the early stages of succession: green moss pine forests are formed at high and relatively dry relief sites (ridges) and polytric pine forests are formed on relatively wet ridge slopes. The ecotopic mosaic is complicated by the vegetation pattern created by animals (e. g., seed hawkers) at the intermediate stages of succession. Zoochoric species appear in the community: Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Convallaria majalis, Sorbus aucuparia and Quercus robur more often take root at the top of ridges; Vaccinium myrtillus, Frangula alnus and Picea abies grow on the slopes. The mosaic created by trees is imposed on a mosaic caused by ecotopes and animals at the final stages of succession: tree-fall gaps appear in the place of old dead trees with tree undergrowth. As a result, a heterogeneous community with a number of asynchronously developing gaps is formed in place of homogeneous pine fores...|$|E

One of our objectives was to test the hypothesis that external factors cause splitting-up of natural forests and their replacement by a range of <b>successional</b> <b>series.</b> Our research was conducted in the Southern Ural Mountains. We studied differentiation of the forest vegetation after clear-cuttings in the most typical environments: on smooth slopes 1 – 2 degrees steep with deep soils, at 400 – 500 m above the sea level. Tree stand, understory, and grass layer were studied within a number of sampling plots (0. 5 ha). To measure biomass of grass and shrub layer laid 10 - 15 subplots (0. 5 x 0. 5 m) within each sampling area. The obtained data was used in Correspondence Analysis (CA). For numerical analysis we used R package vegan. We found that clear-cuttings in the Southern Ural Mountains cause profound transformation of the forest vegetation structure and in all the layers. Patterns of regeneration-age dynamics differ both in tree stand and herbaceous layer: within a single natural forest, a whole range of alternative <b>successional</b> <b>series</b> are formed – spruce, fir, birch, and aspen forests (short-term, long-term, and stable-term secondary), each having specific productivity of herbaceous layer.

Most of the reduction of growth at the lowest nutrient level could be ascribed to root competition. At a high nutrient level the relative importance of root and shoot competition was the same or shoot competition was more important.

Species from the later successional stages (lower nutrient availability, higher level of light at the soil surface) had a higher shoot/root ratio at most treatments, contrary to the predictions of the resource ratio hypothesis. However, a three-way interaction was also found, and thus the combination of light and nutrient level determined whether or not a correspondence between successional position and the sequence of species in shoot/root ratio was found.

Bacterial community composition and diversity were analyzed over four seasons by 16 S rRNA genes using the Ion Torrent PGM platform. Bacterial community composition differed significantly along the tidal flat series. Bacterial phylogenetic diversity increased while phylogenetic turnover decreased from subtidal to supratidal flats. Moreover, the bacterial community structure differed seasonally. Canonical correspondence analysis identified salinity as a major environmental factor structuring the microbial community in the sediment along the <b>successional</b> <b>series.</b> Meanwhile, temperature and nitrite concentration were major drivers of seasonal microbial changes.

For the third harvest the nutrient levels had decreased to a low level, wich probably caused competition to be mainly for nutrients. The extinction coefficient and the lightintensity at the soil of a target species in controls without competition appeared to be good estimate for the outcome of the competition for light when also competition for nutrients was observed. Species from nutrient rich soils were observed to have higher root fractions than species from nutrient poor soils. The outcome of competition for nutrients was positive correlated to the fractions of total biomass in roots of the species.

40|$|International audienceDirectional {{replacement}} and directional non-replacement {{models are}} two alternative paradigms for community development in primary successional environments. The first model emphasizes turnover in species between {{early and late}} successional niches. The second emphasizes accumulation of additional diversity over time. To test whether the development of soil fungal communities in the foreland of an Arctic glacier conforms to either of these models, we collected samples from the Midtre Lovénbreen Glacier, Svalbard, along a soil <b>successional</b> <b>series</b> spanning > 80 years. Soil DNA was extracted, and fungal ITS 1 region was amplified and sequenced on an Illumina Miseq. There was a progressive change in community composition in the soil fungal community, with greatest fungal OTU richness in the Mid Stage (50 - 80 years). A nestedness analysis showed that the Early Stage (20 - 50 years) and the Late Stage (> 80 years) fungal communities were nested within the Mid Stage communities. These results imply that fungal community development in this glacier succession follows a directional replacement model. Soil development processes may initially be important in facilitating arrival of additional fungal species, to give a mid-successional diversity maximum that contains both early- and late-successional fungi.

The species composition and dominance of the grassland vegetation changed markedly during secondary succession and formed a clear <b>successional</b> <b>series,</b> with the species assemblage dominated by Artemisia capillaris→ Heteropappus altaicus→ A. sacrorum.

A spatially aggregated pattern prevailed throughout the entire period of grassland recovery; this was likely linked to the dispersal properties of herbaceous plants and to high habitat heterogeneity. We conclude that natural succession was conducive to the successful recovery of native vegetation.

This is a landscape in flux; a static design response shall not apply. The idea is to integrate ecological, industrial, and social infrastructure into a dynamic and synergetic system.

Methods: One data set was compiled per succession type using the following selection criteria: (i) the data set included a <b>successional</b> <b>series,</b> (ii) plots were located in mesotrophic forest plant communities and (iii) vegetation data were available. The post-agricultural succession data set comprised 76 recent forest plots (eight studies); the post-clear-cut succession data set comprised 218 ancient forest plots (three studies). Each data set was analysed separately using either linear mixed models or generalized linear models, controlling for both environmental heterogeneity and variation between study locations. Results: In the post-agricultural succession data set, {{land use and}} time significantly affected nearly all the studied seed bank characteristics. Seed banks on former arable land recovered poorly even after 150 year of restored forest cover, whereas moderate land use intensities (grasslands, heathlands) yielded more rapid seed bank recovery.

Lengthening of cells or filaments of many cells increases organismic size but preserves the high surface-to-volume ratios that aid optimal interception of underwater light in turbid, mixed layers.

By rototilling, i. e. cyclic, massive disturbance in the vegetation cover, we established a controlled mosaic cycle comprising a <b>successional</b> <b>series</b> from heavily disturbed areas to grassland and shrubs. The disturbance regime affects the landscape on different temporal and spatial scales. The resulting shifting mosaics determine the habitat qualities for plant and animal species.

A previous study indicated nitrogen to be an important limiting factor during the early stages of these <b>successional</b> <b>series.</b> Phosphorus limitation is likely to occur in (more) later stages of succession. Although we found a dramatically increasing C/P ratio in the soil along both sequences, we do not yet have further evidence for the occurrence of phosphorus limitation. The nitrogen fixing shrub Hippophae rhamrioides is likely to have a strong influence on the accumulation speed of nitrogen in the dune sequence. During primary succession an increasing nutrient availability causes a shift in the allocation pattern of plants. A higher proportion of the production will be allocated to plant organs with a lower maintenance requirement. We discuss a model dealing with changes in biomass of several stand compartments caused by a change in resource availability. We compared the changes in biomass and nutrient contents of several compartments during primary succession from bare soil to plain- or dune forest with the trends resulting from the model. We suggest two causes of the increase in biomass, the increasing productivity which {{is the result of a}} decreasing relative allocation to the root system and a decreasing specific respiration for the whole vegetation. For both sequences the maximum amount of root per square meter was found in the 28 year old stage. This indicates, according to the model, a shift in allocation from plant organs with a high maintenance to plant organs with low maintenance driven by an increased nutrient availability. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Six {{woody species}} from a <b>successional</b> <b>series</b> growing in their {{establishment}} phases in a premontane tropical Costa Rican rainforest were analysed in detail concerning whole canopy carbon gains – using two principally different photo-synthesis models. Crown architectures of 65 individuals, 0. 2 to 4. 5 m high, were monitored {{over two years}} and precisely reconstructed in 3 dimensions. For each single leaf of 28 selected plants light absorption on daily bases was calculated using the reconstructed plant canopies and the light data as inputs. For identical daily light courses net photosynthesis was simulated using firstly, a steady-state and, secondly, a dynamic photosynthesis model which takes light-controlled photosynthetic induction states into account. Canopy carbon gain was determined by summing daily leaf net carbon gains for each individual leaf and integrating over a whole year. Observed biomass increments of all individuals showed only plausible agreement when the dynamic photosynthesis model was used. Comparing steady-state and dynamic model approaches resulted in strong, unrealistic overestimations by the steady-state model, showing at minimum 30 % (in pioneers) and at maximum 650 % overestimated annual canopy carbon gains in the mid- to late-successional plants. Lightflecks alternating with low light availability contributed to deficiencies in the photosynthetic induction state, which are only accounted for in the dynamic model. Pioneers invest about 33 % of annual carbon in short-lived leaves and the remainder (ca. 42 %) in supporting tissues. In contrast, late-successionals partition only 8 – 18 % into leaves of much greater longevity and 57 – 67 % to build “expensive” supporting structures of high wood density and high longevity – very likely forming the base for future growth into th...|$|E

Selected {{physical and chemical}} soil properties were studied in an old-growth forest across a forest <b>successional</b> <b>series</b> in Dinghushan Nature Reserve, Southern China. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The aim {{was to assess the}} effects of forest succession change on soil properties. Soil samples (0 - 20 cm depth) were collected from three forest types at different succession stages, namely pine (Pinus massoniana) forest (PMF), mixed pine and broadleaf forest (PBMF) and monsoon evergreen broadleaf forest (MEBF), representing early, middle and advanced successional stages respectively. The soil samples were analyzed for soil water storage (SWS), soil organic matter (SOM), soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), pH, NH 4 (+) -N, available potassium (K), available phosphorus (P) and microelements (available copper (Cu), available zinc (Zn), available iron (Fe) and available boron (B)) between 1999 and 2009. The results showed that SWS, SOM, SMBC, Cu, Zn, Fe and B concentrations were higher in the advanced successional stage (MEBF stage). Conversely, P and pH were lower in the MEBF but higher in the PMF (early successional stage). pH, NH 4 (+) -N, P and K declined while SOM, Zn, Cu, Fe and B increased with increasing forest age. Soil pH was lower than 4. 5 in the three forest types, indicating that the surface soil was acidic, a stable trend in Dinghushan. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrated significant impacts of natural succession in an old-growth forest on the surface soil nutrient properties and organic matter. Changes in soil properties along the forest succession gradient may be a useful index for evaluating the successional stages of the subtropical forests.

Soil development and vegetation structure during this <b>successional</b> <b>series</b> could be reconstructed, since several stages of this succession were present in the same part of the island. Salinity, moisture content and flooding are considered to be major determinants of the spatial variation, ranging from saline, wet plains to dry, fresh dunes, and are likely to be responsible for the year to year fluctuations of short-living species. However, these factors did not show a trend in time. From soil analyses it is argued that nitrogen limits the total biomass. In about 16 years the total amount of nitrogen in the organic layer of the soil increased from 7 to 50 g N m in the plains and from 1 to 15 g N nf 2 on the dunes. The accumulation of nitrogen during succession is accompanied by an increased biomass, a decreased light penetration to the soil-surface, a decreased proportion root, an increased proportion stem, an increased plant height at maturity, and a decreasing abundance of short-living species. Only during the first stage on the dry dunes sand-blowing is considered to prevent small species from establishing. With the exception of this early dune stage, our observations are in agreement with the resource ratio hypothesis of Tilman (1985). Causes of the high rates of nitrogen accumulation in the soil are discussed. The observed nitrogen accumulation, which is considered to be an important determinant of the successional dynamics, is thought to be facilitated by the vegetation. ...|$|E
40|$|Successional {{dynamics}} in plant community assembly {{may result from}} both deterministic and stochastic ecological processes. The relative importance of different ecological processes is expected to vary over the successional sequence, between different plant functional groups, and with the disturbance levels and land-use management regimes of the successional systems. We evaluate {{the relative importance of}} stochastic and deterministic processes in bryophyte and vascular plant community assembly after fire in grazed and ungrazed anthropogenic coastal heathlands in Northern Europe. A replicated series of post-fire successions (n = 12) were initiated under grazed and ungrazed conditions, and vegetation data were recorded in permanent plots over 13 years. We used redundancy analysis (RDA) to test for deterministic successional patterns in species composition repeated across the replicate <b>successional</b> <b>series</b> and analyses of co-occurrence to evaluate to what extent species respond synchronously along the successional gradient. Change in species co-occurrences over succession indicates stochastic successional dynamics at the species level (i. e., species equivalence), whereas constancy in co-occurrence indicates deterministic dynamics (successional niche differentiation). The RDA shows high and deterministic vascular plant community compositional change, especially early in succession. Co-occurrence analyses indicate stochastic species-level dynamics the first two years, which then give way to more deterministic replacements. Grazed and ungrazed successions are similar, but the early stage stochasticity is higher in ungrazed areas. Bryophyte communities in ungrazed successions resemble vascular plant communities. In contrast, bryophytes in grazed successions showed consistently high stochasticity and low determinism in both community composition and species co-occurrence. In conclusion, stochastic and individualistic species responses early in succession give way to more niche-driven {{dynamics in}} later successional stages. Grazing reduces predictability in both successional trends and species-level dynamics, especially in plant functional groups that are not well adapted to disturbance. bryophytes; burning; Calluna vulgaris; coexistence; conservation management; determinism; disturbance; grazing; heathland; randomization test; stochasticity; vascular plants...|$|E
