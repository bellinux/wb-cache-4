To this end the researcher attempted to create tasks for which the production of the target grammatical structures would be ???natural??? (Loschcky & Bley-Vroman, 1993, p. 132). For the purpose of this study, ???task naturalness??? was defined as successful elicitation from a ???significant majority??? of native speakers. Using a process of ???iterative, consensusbased, specification-driven testing??? (Davidson & Lynch, 2002, p. 7), two types of tasks were developed: 1) Spoken dyadic role-plays designed to elicit expressions of willingness (e. g., ???I???d love to help, but??????) and 2) Written logic puzzles designed to elicit proof-by-contradiction (e. g., ???If the light were off, Sherlock would know the answer. ???). In general, both task types were successful at eliciting either counterfactual <b>second</b> <b>conditionals</b> or related grammatical structures.

50|$|Different {{types of}} {{conditional}} sentences (depending largely {{on whether they}} refer to a past, present or future time frame) {{require the use of}} particular verb forms (tenses and moods) to express the condition and the consequence. In English language teaching the most common patterns are referred to as first conditional, <b>second</b> <b>conditional</b> and third conditional; there is also a zero conditional and mixed conditional.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were two}} {{distinct}} conditional tenses, a [...] "first conditional" [...] that {{was similar to}} the conditional tense in other Romance languages and a [...] "second conditional" [...] derived from the Latin pluperfect indicative tense. The <b>second</b> <b>conditional</b> is cognate with the literary pluperfect in Portuguese, the -ra imperfect subjunctive in Spanish, the second preterite of very early Old French (Sequence of Saint Eulalia), and probably the future perfect in modern Gascon.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{the past}} {{imperfect}} subjunctive {{is used to}} replace the present conditional. This form is called the present <b>conditional</b> <b>second</b> form (Conditionnel présent deuxième forme). In contrast the regular conditional is then called present conditional first form (Conditionnel présent première forme). This has become very unusual, only in sentences starting with Même si and the expression fût-ce this form is still used.

5000|$|In a {{sentence}} with [...] "if", unlike in English, the appropriate conditional tense {{is used in}} both the [...] "if" [...] clause and the main clause.

("If you met would meet the Queen, what would you say?") (cf. the <b>second</b> <b>conditional</b> in English). The past conditional is used for past events which did not happen, e.g. Ha nem találkoztunk volna a királynővel, órákkal ezelőtt megérkeztünk volna. ("If we hadn't wouldn't have met the Queen, we would have arrived hours ago.") (cf. the third conditional in English).|$|E
5000|$|In English {{conditional}} sentences, {{the condition}} clause (protasis) is most commonly {{introduced by the}} conjunction if, or sometimes other conjunctions or expressions such as unless, provided (that), providing (that) and as long as. Certain condition clauses can also be formulated using inversion without any conjunction (should you fail...; were he to die...; had they helped us... see also the corresponding section about inversion in the English subjunctive article).In English language teaching, conditional sentences are often classified under the headings zero conditional, first conditional (or conditional I), <b>second</b> <b>conditional</b> (or conditional II), third conditional (or conditional III) and mixed conditional, according to the grammatical pattern followed. A range of variations on these structures are possible.|$|E

50|$|Serbian verbs are {{conjugated}} in four past forms—perfect, aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect—of {{which the}} last two have a very limited use (imperfect is still used in some dialects, {{but the majority of}} native Serbian speakers consider it archaic), one future tense (also known as the first future tense, as opposed to the second future tense or the future exact, which is considered a tense of the conditional mood by some contemporary linguists), and one present tense. These are the tenses of the indicative mood. Apart from the indicative mood, there is also the imperative mood. The conditional mood has two more tenses: the first conditional (commonly used in conditional clauses, both for possible and impossible conditional clauses) and the <b>second</b> <b>conditional</b> (without use in the spoken language—it should be used for impossible conditional clauses).
