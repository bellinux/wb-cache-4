5|$|The {{steering}} ratio is the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire {{behavior and the}} actual turning radius. Values less than one, where the front wheel <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> {{is greater than the}} rear wheel <b>side</b> <b>slip,</b> are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> than front wheel have been described as counter-steering. Riders tend to prefer neutral or slight over-steering. Car drivers tend to prefer under-steering.|$|E
25|$|Cushen {{played his}} first match for Otago on 9 January 1968 {{as in the}} Plunket Shield against Canterbury. He took one wicket in the first innings for 62 runs, scored nine and a duck as Otago was forced to follow on, and saw his <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> to an innings and 44 run defeat. In his first full season across the summer of 1968-69, Cushen played five {{first-class}} matches in which he scored 74 runs at 12.33 with a best of 27, however he struggled with the ball, taking six wickets at 71.50. Cushen played no matches across the 1969-70 or 1970-71 seasons, and {{only one in the}} 1971-72 where he took three wickets at 33.33 each, and scored 23 runs at 11.50. He played three matches across the winter of 1972-73, scoring 25 runs at 5.00, and struggling with the ball, taking three wickets at 79.00. Cushen also played three List-A matches, however he was only required to bat once and was dismissed for a duck. He nevertheless enjoyed success with the ball, taking five wickets at 22.80.|$|E
2500|$|With weather {{conditions}} more favourable {{than they had}} been throughout December, Torquay were keen to get themselves back into contention for a play-off spot. [...] However, two draws, two defeats and only one win saw the <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> from 7th position at the end of 2010 to a disappointing 13th place in the League Two table by the end of January. [...] With their unprecedented clean sheet record of earlier in the season a dim and distant memory, the Gulls were now too often succumbing to late goals with a total of seven points being dropped in the dying moments of the games against Oxford, Morecambe and Gillingham. [...] The most encouraging display of the month was reserved for the fewer than 2,000 spectators who turned out at Plainmoor for the 2-1 win over in-form Crewe Alexandra with Torquay claiming their first home victory in the league since October.|$|E

50|$|Another use of {{the term}} {{steering}} ratio is for the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire behavior and the actual turning radius based on real tire behavior. Values less than one, where the front wheel <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> is greater than the rear wheel <b>side</b> <b>slip,</b> are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering.

5000|$|In vehicle dynamics, <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> {{angle is}} defined as the angle made by the {{velocity}} vector to longitudinal axis of the vehicle at the center of gravity in an instantaneous frame.

Thus at very high speed turns and small turning radius, there is a high lateral acceleration and [...] could be a negative value.|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{the energy}} {{dissipation}} {{can improve the}} movement efficiency of a snake-like robot. Avoiding <b>side</b> <b>slipping</b> is the main {{way to reduce the}} energy dissipation. A creeping control method for the snake-like robot, named optimal passive creeping, is proposed. This method makes the robot avoid slipping by inputting the proper torque which is adjusted by its body shape. The purpose of the control method is to insure that the snake-like robot’s velocity is the fastest before <b>side</b> <b>slipping.</b> In simulation, the angles, torques, energy states of the snake-like robot are revealed, and whether the snake-like robot has slipped is analyzed by accumulating the energy dissipation.

5|$|Also, because real tires have {{a finite}} contact patch {{with the road}} surface that can {{generate}} a scrub torque, and when in a turn, can experience some <b>side</b> <b>slipping</b> as they roll, they can generate torques about an axis normal to {{the plane of the}} contact patch.|$|R

50|$|During the {{production}} of the Series II the tail skids were replaced with tail wheels and later on, swiveling wheels.

5000|$|The {{principle}} {{employed in}} using a screw propeller {{is used in}} sculling.

50|$|The {{vertical}} stabilizers, vertical stabilisers, or fins, of aircraft, missiles or {{bombs are}} typically {{found on the}} aft end of the fuselage or body, and are intended to reduce aerodynamic <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> and provide direction stability.

50|$|In a {{rear wheel}} drive vehicle, {{increased}} front toe in provides greater straight-line stability {{at the cost of}} some sluggishness of turning response.

50|$|When an {{aircraft}} {{is put into}} a <b>side</b> <b>slip</b> with no other changes to the throttle or elevator, the pilot will notice an increased rate of descent (or reduced rate of ascent).
