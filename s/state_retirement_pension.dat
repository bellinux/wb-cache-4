Thus the NIF do not hold money directed for the general provision of health services in the United Kingdom.

40|$|Labor force {{participation}} of men over age 50 fell {{sharply in the}} UK between the early 1970 s and early 1990 s. Despite {{the fact that the}} <b>state</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>pension</b> does not become available to men until age 65, half of men aged 60 - 64 were economically inactive in the mid 1990 s. The main element of the <b>state</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>pension</b> is flat rate, and for most people is unaffected by any potential contributions made after age 60. Additional amounts of the earnings related component, SERPS, are earned as a result of extra contribu- tions. Overall the <b>state</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>pension</b> system offers no incentives for people to retire early. However, other benefits are available to people before the age of 65. Once the age of 60 is reached there is no availability for work test for receipt of means-tested benefits and there appears to be widespread use of invalidity and sickness benefits as a route into early retirement. Once these are accounted for a substantial incentive for early withdrawal from the labor market is apparent. The combination of this with the reduced demand for, and wages available to, low skilled labor can explain the reduced labor force participation that is observed. The state pension system, though, is complemented by extensive occupational pension coverage. For those in the occupational system the rules of their own scheme are likely to be an important element in their retirement decision. We show that the retirement behavior of those with and without occupational pensions is substantially different. Those without are more likely to withdraw from the labor market very early. A large share of those with occupational pensions retires from the age of 55 when relatively generous benefits are likely to become available. In many schemes there are incentives to retire before age 65...|$|E

40|$|The basic <b>state</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>pension</b> is payable {{irrespective}} of means {{but it is}} a contributory benefit, not a universal benefit. Individuals who do not have enough National Insurance contributions when they reach state pension age are not entitled to a full state pension. They may receive a proportion of the pension or just the dependant’s addition to a spouse’s pension. This reflects the fact that the pension system in the UK, and the system of unemployment and sickness benefits, were designed around the contributory principle. As Dilnot, Kay and Morris (1984) pointed out in their comprehensive review of social security policy, ‘The Beveridge report took the contributory principle extremely seriously. Contributions were to be levied on an actuarially calculated basis to reflect the benefits received’. But ‘the retreat from this principle has been comprehensive [...] . The National Insurance fund was reduced to meaningless accounting and the actuarial link between contributions and benefits abandoned’. In this strong sense, we have never operated a contributory principle. ...|$|E
40|$|ISER Working Paper Series www. iser. essex. ac. ukNon-technical Summary This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the construction of measures of household income for respondents to the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). The focus is on a measure of net income. Sometimes also referred to as disposable income, net income refers to total money income from the labour market, cash benefits and tax credits including the <b>state</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>pension,</b> savings and investment income including private and occupational pensions, and private transfers, from which is deducted income tax payments, employee national insurance and occupational pension contributions, and local tax payments. (Gross income equals total income prior to the deductions referred to.) The household income variable provided in the official release of BHPS data is a gross income measure. However it is widely agreed that analysis of the personal distribution of income, inequality and poverty – trends over time and longitudinal dynamics – should use net income rather than gross income measures. ISER researchers have derived net income measures using BHPS data and, on an ad hoc basis, made these available as unofficial supplements to the main BHPS release files. BHPS net income variables are widely used. They also form part of the BHPS component of the Cross-National Equivalent File. (The CNEF contains comparable household panel dat...|$|E

40|$|In {{a climate}} of declining birth rates, {{increasing}} age of the life expectancy {{of the population and}} huge emigration rates in Baltic countries it becomes important the topic about the financial situation of the elderly people. Although the cost of living in countries is growing, today, the average <b>state</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>pension</b> in the Baltic countries is extremely low: barely {{more than one-third of the}} average wage. Because of the bad financial situation and lack of negative prevailing demographic prospects of Baltic countries it will be increasingly difficult to provide retirees with the proper amount of social benefits in the future. It is forecasted, that in the near future of the Baltic countries, fewer and fewer working people will have to support an increasing number of retirement-age population. Due to the escalation of existing and demographic problems in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia there came II pillar pension funds, whose purpose was to ensure adequate retirement income through private pension accumulating. Despite the fact that there are many affirmative thoughts about the II pillar pension funds performance, there are a lot of uncertainty about these pension funds effectivenes. In order to understand if II pillar pension funds in Baltic countries are working effectively, we decided to do the research on the II pillar pension funds performance evaluation...|$|E

The analysis suggests that households {{at the peak of}} their working lives have relatively low savings though {{there is no evidence of}} a generational savings gap.

40|$|In recent years, many {{countries}} with mandatory defined benefit pay-as-you-go (“PAYG”) systems have modified their systems to include individual accounts for financing <b>retirement</b> <b>pensions.</b> In {{most of these}} countries, {{a portion of the}} mandatory pension system’s contribution rate has been “carved-out”, and contributions earmarked by the carve-out are channeled into retirement accounts. Upon reaching retirement age, the contributions and accumulated interest in an individual’s account are used to finance all or part of that individual’s total <b>retirement</b> <b>pension.</b> Although an individual account may be a useful vehicle for financing retirement income, it may not prove sufficient for financing disability benefits. In a pension system that depends solely or partly on individual investment accounts, individuals who become disabled at a young age might lack sufficient capital in their individual accounts to finance adequate disability pensions. Generally, therefore, the implementation of “carve out” accounts for financing retirement benefits will necessitate changes to the financing mechanism for disability benefits. A wide range of policy options exists for adapting disability benefits to operate in a pension system with carve-out retirement accounts. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine how countries with carve-out individual retirement accounts have approached disability reform, and to assess the applicability of these approaches in the United <b>States.</b> financing, <b>retirement,</b> <b>pensions...</b>|$|R

We also present an indicator of the Spanish system's solvency which emerges from the actuarial balance sheet, and simulates the effect that certain changes in the parameters of the present system would have on solvency, showing the direction that could be taken if the mechanism were to be introduced in Spain. A comparison between the official balance sheet for the Swedish notional account system and our balance sheet for the Spanish contributory pension system is also provided.

40|$|Abstract. Housing {{and pension}} wealth are {{shown to be}} {{important}} determi-nants of personal sector consumption and retirement behaviour in the UK. Housing and state pension wealth have a positive e®ect on consumption, while private pen-sion wealth promotes greater savings. Greater private de¯ned bene¯t pension wealth encourages earlier retirement, while greater de¯ned contribution pension wealth has the e®ect of delaying <b>retirement.</b> <b>State</b> <b>pension</b> wealth appears to have no e®ect on the retirement decision. Other variables relating to income, labour market and demographic status and spillovers from other sectors are also shown to be important. The consumption equation forecasts the late 1980 s boom and the early 1990 s slump in the UK better than other models that disregard housing and pension wealth. A particularly important cause of the boom was the huge private pension fund surpluses that accrued {{as a result of}} the stock market boom of the 1980 s...|$|R

One {{of which was a}} bill that {{required}} state contractors to pay their employees a “living wage.” For fiscal year 2008, the living wage is set at $11.30 in Montgomery, Prince George’s, Howard, Anne Arundel and Baltimore Counties and Baltimore City. It is set at $8.50 for all other areas of the State. Additionally, the Caucus pushed for SB 488. This bill allows an individual convicted of any crime, with the exception of buying or selling votes, to register to vote if not actually serving a court-ordered sentence of imprisonment, including any term of parole or probation, for a felony conviction. Another Caucus bill, SB 543-2007 Darfur Protection Act-Divestiture from the Republic of Sudan, requires the Board of Trustees of the <b>State</b> <b>Retirement</b> and <b>Pension</b> System to encourage companies hold actively traded accounts in its portfolio that conduct business in Sudan to act responsibly and avoid actions that promote or enable human rights violations in Sudan.
