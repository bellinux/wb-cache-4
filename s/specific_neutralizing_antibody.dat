Moreover, pigs vaccinated with SHV- 1 were fully protected against a lethal virus challenge. Pigs vaccinated with a recombinant (r) SHV- 1 virus, followed by challenge with a virulent SHV- 1, had lower percentages of circulating T- and B-lymphocytes, and {{showed a significant}} (P < or = 0. 05) reduction in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) antibody-dependent cell-cytotoxicity than control (noninfected, SHV- 1 sero-negative) animals. From the 5 th through the 8 th week of postchallenge, rSHV- 1 was isolated from 2 of 4 pigs. Presence of r-virus was indicative that PBMC were infectious in vivo. The rSHV- 1, with beta-galactosidase activity, was only recovered from ConA- and IL- 2 -stimulated primary PBMC cocultivated with porcine kidney cells. Control pigs exposed to challenge SHV- 1 elicited both <b>specific</b> <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibody</b> and lympho-proliferative responses followed by subsequent infection.

40|$|Bovine viral {{diarrhea}} virus (BVDV) plays a {{key role}} in bovine respiratory disease complex, which can lead to pneumonia, diarrhea and death of calves. Current vaccines are not very effective due, in part, to immunosuppressive traits and failure to induce broad protection. There are diverse BVDV strains and thus, current vaccines contain representative genotype 1 and 2 viruses (BVDV- 1 & 2) to broaden coverage. BVDV modified live virus (MLV) vaccines are superior to killed virus vaccines, but they are susceptible to neutralization and complement-mediated destruction triggered by passively acquired antibodies, thus limiting their efficacy. We generated three novel mosaic polypeptide chimeras, designated NproE 2123; NS 231; and NS 232, which incorporate protective determinants that are highly conserved among BVDV- 1 a, 1 b, and BVDV- 2 genotypes. In addition, strain-specific protective antigens from disparate BVDV strains were included to broaden coverage. We confirmed that adenovirus constructs expressing these antigens were strongly recognized by monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal sera, and IFN-γ-secreting T cells generated against diverse BVDV strains. In a proof-of-concept efficacy study, the multi-antigen proto-type vaccine induced higher, but not significantly different, IFN-γ spot forming cells and T-cell proliferation compared to a commercial MLV vaccine. In regards to the humoral response, the prototype vaccine induced higher BVDV- 1 <b>specific</b> <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibody</b> titers, whereas the MLV vaccine induced higher BVDV- 2 <b>specific</b> <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibody</b> titers. Following BVDV type 2 a (1373) challenge, calves immunized with the proto-type or the MLV vaccine had lower clinical scores compared to naïve controls. These results support the hypothesis that a broadly protective subunit vaccine can be generated using mosaic polypeptides that incorporate rationally selected and validated protective determinants from diverse BVDV strains. Furthermore, regarding biosafety of using a live vector in cattle, we showed that recombinant human adenovirus- 5 was cleared within one week following intradermal inoculation...|$|E
40|$|Golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) {{experimentally}} {{infected with}} West Nile virus (WNV) developed chronic renal infection and persistent shedding of virus in urine {{for up to}} 8 months, despite initial rapid clearance of virus from blood and the timely appearance of high levels of <b>specific</b> <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Infectious WNV could be recovered by direct culture of their urine and by cocultivation of kidney tissue for up to 247 days after initial infection.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that phosphoglucose isomerase/autocrine {{motility}} factor (AMF) promotes cell migration in an autocrine manner in various tumor cells. However, it remains unclear whether certain cytokines modulate the effects of AMF on tumor cell migration. Because interleukin (IL) - 8, a proinflammatory cytokine, is produced by melanoma cells and has been correlated with melanoma migration, the migratory ability of melanoma cells induced by AMF may also involve induction of IL- 8 expression. In the present study, we assessed whether AMF promotes melanoma cell migration through autocrine production of IL- 8. We found that AMF stimulation increased IL- 8 production through up-regulation of IL- 8 mRNA transcription, especially in biologically early stage melanoma cells. AMF-induced migration of these cells was inhibited by a <b>specific</b> <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibody</b> against IL- 8. The IL- 8 production induced by AMF was mediated by the ERK 1 / 2 pathways.

40|$|Abstract: Neutrophil {{infiltration}} into inflammatory {{sites is}} one of the hallmarks of acute inflammation. Locally produced chemotactic factors are presumed to mediate the sequence of events leading to the infiltration at inflammatory sites. Interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), a novel leukocyte chemotactic activating cytokine (chemokine), is produced by various types of cells upon stimulation with inflammatory stimuli and exerts a variety of functions on leukocytes, particularly, neutrophils in vitro. However, no definitive evidence has been presented on its role in recruiting and activating neutrophils in the lesions of various types of inflammatory reactions. We administered a highly <b>specific</b> <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibody</b> against IL- 8 in several types of acute inflammatory reactions, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced dermatitis, LPS/IL- 1 -induced arthritis, lung reperfusion injury, and acute immune complex-type glomerulonephritis.

40|$|Several {{medically}} important mosquito-borne flaviviruses {{have been detected}} in Argentina in recent years: Dengue (DENV), St. Louis encephalitis (SLEV), West Nile (WNV) and Yellow Fever (YFV) viruses. Evidence of Bussuquara virus (BSQV) and Ilheus virus (ILHV) activity were found, {{but they have not}} been associated with human disease. Non-human primates can act as important hosts in the natural cycle of flaviviruses and serological studies can lead to improved understanding of virus circulation dynamics and host susceptibility. From July-August 2010, we conducted serological and molecular surveys in free-ranging black howlers (Alouatta caraya) captured in northeastern Argentina. We used 90 % plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNT 90) to analyze 108 serum samples for antibodies to WNV, SLEV, YFV, DENV (serotypes 1 and 3), ILHV, and BSQV. Virus genome detection was performed using generic reverse transcription (RT) -nested PCR to identify flaviviruses in 51 antibody-negative animals. Seventy animals had antibodies for one or more flaviviruses for a total antibody prevalence of 64. 8 % (70 / 108). Monotypic (13 / 70, 19 %) and heterotypic (27 / 70, 39 %) patterns were differentiated. <b>Specific</b> <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibodies</b> against WNV, SLEV, DENV- 1, DENV- 3, ILHV, and BSQV were found.

This is the first detection of WNV-specific antibodies in black howlers from Argentina and the first report in free-ranging non-human primates from Latin-American countries. Given that no animals had <b>specific</b> <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibodies</b> to YFV, our results suggest that the study population remains susceptible to YFV.

Immune spleen cells obtained 4 [...] 7 days after infection were cytotoxic for viral-infected myofibers. Peak reactivity was observed 5 days after infection.

40|$|Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} {{is a major}} cause of chronic liver disease (CLD) and is frequently linked to intrahepatic microvascular disorders. Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) is a central event in liver damage, due to their contribution to hepatic renewal and to the development of fibrosis and hepatocarcinoma. During the progression of CLDs, HSC attempt to restore injured tissue by stimulating repair processes, such as fibrosis and angiogenesis. Because HSC express the key vascular receptor Tie 2, among other angiogenic receptors and mediators, we analyzed its involvement in the development of CLD. Methods: Tie 2 expression was monitored in HSC cultures that were exposed to media from HCV-expressing cells (replicons). The effects of Tie 2 blockade on HSC activation by either neutralizing antibody or specific signaling inhibitors were also examined. Results: Media from HCV-replicons enhanced HSC activation and invasion and upregulated Tie 2 expression. Notably, the blockade of Tie 2 receptor (by a <b>specific</b> <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibody)</b> or signaling (by selective AKT and MAPK inhibitors) significantly reduced alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) expression and the invasive potential of HCV-conditioned HSC.

However, the inhibition of IKKα did not alter the RLR signaling-mediated dimerization of interferon responsive factor 3 (IRF 3) or the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NFκB). These results suggest a non-canonical role of IKKα in RLR signaling. Furthermore, phosphorylation of STAT 1 was suppressed by IKKα knockdown in cells treated with a <b>specific</b> <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibody</b> for the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) and in IFNAR-deficient cells. Collectively, the dual regulation of STAT 1 by IKKα in antiviral signaling suggests a role for IKKα in the fine-tuning of antiviral signaling in response to non-self RNA...|$|E
40|$|Liu-Chiu islet, a {{relatively}} isolated ecosystem that {{is free of}} rice cultivation, has long considered free of Japanese encephalitis (JE). However, a new strain (T 1 P 1) of JE virus was isolated from the mosquito, Armigeres subalbatus, and a rather broad distribution of <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibody</b> has been reported on the islet, suggesting that the circulating virus could be an attenuated strain. In an assessment on 2 19 blood samples obtained from residents of Liu-Chiu islet, the positive rate of JEV-specific IgM antibodies decreased with age while that of <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibodies</b> increased with age. Both antibodies were mainly responsive to the T 1 P 1 strain since higher positive rates and titers of <b>specific</b> <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibodies</b> are shown in this investigation. Importantly, the T 1 P 1 strain is herein characterized as being broader in neutralizing virus strains, stable in genetic traits, and productive in Vero cells. Taken together, the JE virus strain endemically circulating on Liu-Chiu islet may {{have served as a}} natural form of a live-attenuated vaccine. As a result, it possibly can be utilized as a new and effective vaccine candidate in the future. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In {{northern}} Western Australia in 2011 and 2012, surveillance {{detected a}} novel arbovirus in mosquitoes. Genetic and phenotypic analyses {{confirmed that the}} new flavivirus, named Fitzroy River virus, is related to Sepik virus and Wesselsbron virus, in the yellow fever virus group. Most (81 %) isolates came from Aedes normanensis mosquitoes, providing circumstantial evidence of the probable vector. In cell culture, Fitzroy River virus replicated in mosquito (C 6 / 36), mammalian (Vero, PSEK, and BSR), and avian (DF- 1) cells. It also infected intraperitoneally inoculated weanling mice and caused mild clinical disease in 3 intracranially inoculated mice. <b>Specific</b> <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibodies</b> were detected in sentinel horses (12. 6 %), cattle (6. 6 %), and chickens (0. 5 %) in the Northern Territory of Australia and in a subset of humans (0. 8 %) from northern Western Australia. 28726621 PMC 554778...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} three non-replicating {{smallpox vaccine}} candidates (modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), NYVAC and HR) for their immunogenicity {{and ability to}} protect mice against an intranasal cowpox virus challenge and compared them with the traditional replicating vaccine. A single immunisation with the non-replicating vaccines induced a complete protection from death at short-term, but was not fully protective when mice were challenged 150 days post-vaccination with protection correlated with the <b>specific</b> <b>neutralizing</b> <b>antibodies</b> and CD 4 (+) T-cells responses. Prime-boost vaccination enabled effective long-term protection from death for mice vaccinated with MVA, but protection from disease and CD 4 (+) T-cell level were lower than the ones induced by the traditional vaccine over the long-term period. Further investigations are necessary with MVA to determine the optimal conditions of immunisation to induce at long-term immunogenicity and protection observed with the 1 st generation smallpox vaccine...|$|R
