40|$|Présenté par G. DrobychevShallow traps {{influence}} the radiation damage behaviour of lead tungstate <b>scintillation</b> <b>crystals</b> {{when exposed to}} continuous low dose rate radiation. Radiation initiates diffusion of Oxygen vacancies in the crystal giving rise to their aggregation if their density is high enough, which creates deeper traps than single vacancies. The situation may occur in high luminosity experiments where <b>scintillation</b> <b>crystals</b> are exposed {{for long periods of}} time to irradiation. The experimental results presented in this paper illustrate the importance of optimizing the crystals by reducing the concentration of the shallow traps and not only of the deep traps...|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Curran and Strothers went to work at the Telecommunications Research Establishment at Worth Matravers on the {{development}} of radar. In 1944, he moved to the University of California, Berkeley to participate in the Manhattan Project, developing the atomic bomb. There he invented scintillation counter by adding a photomultiplier tube to an existing <b>scintillation</b> <b>crystal</b> which had previously been viewed by the human eye to obtain a radiation count. This device is widely used to this day to measure ionizing radiation.After the war Curran worked at the University of Glasgow and at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston and invented the proportional counter in 1948.|$|E
50|$|Gamma {{counters}} {{are usually}} scintillation counters. In a typical system, {{a number of}} samples are placed in sealed vials or test tubes, and moved along a track. One at a time, they move down inside a shielded detector, set to measure specific energy windows characteristic of the particular isotope. Within this shielded detector there is a <b>scintillation</b> <b>crystal</b> that surrounds the radioactive sample. Gamma rays emitted from the radioactive sample interact with the crystal, are absorbed, and light is emitted. A detector, such as a photomultiplier tube converts the visible light to an electrical signal. Depending on the half-life and concentration of the sample, measurement times may vary from 0.02 minutes to several hours.|$|E
40|$|Because {{of their}} superb energy {{resolution}} and detection efficiency <b>scintillation</b> <b>crystals</b> {{are widely used}} in high energy and nuclear physics experiments. A crucial issue is radiation damage in crystals. We report an investigation on γ-ray induced radiation damage in various crystal scintillators of large size, including BaF_ 2, BGO, CeF_ 3, pure CsI, LSO/LYSO/LFS and PWO, with an integrated dose up to 340 Mrad and a dose rate up to 1 Mrad/h. Optical and scintillation properties of these crystal samples were measured before and after irradiations. The results show that pure CsI has good radiation hardness below 100 krad. BaF_ 2, BGO and LYSO have good radiation hardness beyond 1 Mrad. In terms of light output degradation LYSO is clearly the best among all <b>scintillation</b> <b>crystals...</b>|$|R
40|$|Phoswich {{detectors}} {{based on}} <b>scintillation</b> <b>crystals</b> are widely diffused for both PET and SPECT applications. In order {{to separate the}} signals arising from different layers many methods have been proposed in literature. Separation of the layers commonly relies on time discrimination or pulse height discrimination. In this work, by means of experimental measurement on a phoswich detector based on Lanthanum Bromide and Lutetium Fine Silicate monolithic crystals, a novel method allowing to separate signals coming from different layers has been evaluated. The main feature of this method, specifically developed for phoswich based on monolithic <b>scintillation</b> <b>crystals,</b> is the discrimination capability based on the scintillation light distribution shape. For this reason, the findings that will be shown could be easily extended to whatever combination of scintillator, independently from their decay time or light yield...|$|R

5000|$|Natural {{gamma ray}} tools are {{designed}} to measure gamma radiation in the Earth caused by the disintegration of naturally occurring potassium, uranium, and thorium. Unlike nuclear tools, these natural gamma ray tools emit no radiation. The tools have a radiation sensor, which is usually a <b>scintillation</b> <b>crystal</b> that emits a light pulse proportional {{to the strength of}} the gamma ray striking it. This light pulse is then converted to a current pulse by means of a photomultiplier tube (PMT). From the photomultiplier tube, the current pulse goes to the tool's electronics for further processing and ultimately to the surface system for recording. The strength of the received gamma rays is dependent on the source emitting gamma rays, the density of the formation, and the distance between the source and the tool detector. The log recorded by this tool is used to identify lithology, estimate shale content, and depth correlation of future logs.wire line is covered with wire ...|$|E

Its XRT {{consisted of a}} continuously spinning wheel (1.7 s period) in which the hard X-ray experiment was mounted with a radial view.

The instrument operated from 7.7 to 210 keV with 6 channels. OSO-3 obtained extensive observations of solar flares, the diffuse component of cosmic X-rays, and the observation of a single flare episode from Scorpius X-1, the first observation of an extrasolar X-ray source by an observatory satellite. Among the extrasolar X-ray sources OSO 3 observed were UV Ceti, YZ Canis Minoris, EV Lacertae and AD Leonis, yielding upper soft X-ray detection limits on flares from these sources.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} most recent {{advances}} in photo-detector design employed in time of flight positron emission tomography (ToF-PET). PET is a molecular imaging modality that collects pairs of coincident (temporally correlated) annihilation photons emitted from the patient body. The annihilation photon detector typically comprises a <b>scintillation</b> <b>crystal</b> coupled to a fast photo-detector. ToF information provides better localization of the annihilation event along the line formed by each detector pair, resulting in an overall improvement in {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) of the reconstructed image. Apart from the demand for high luminosity and fast decay time of the <b>scintillation</b> <b>crystal,</b> proper design and selection of the photo-detector and methods for arrival time pick-off are a prerequisite for achieving excellent time resolution required for ToF-PET.

This gamma camera can detect individual gamma interactions with 160 ?m FWHM accuracy and 49 % FWHM energy resolution for 99 mTc. However, the monolithic nature of the crystal results in large light spread on the sensor, increasing the relative influence of the sensor noise and degrading the performance. The inclusion of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) {{on the sides of the}} crystal provides additional information on the interactions in the <b>scintillation</b> <b>crystal.</b> This considerably improves the performance of our gamma camera, particularly reducing the background of falsely detected events.
