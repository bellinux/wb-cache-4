40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} two technology programs sponsored by NASA to investigate the characteristics of two thrust vectoring schemes for V/STOL aircraft. The operational capability of the VTOL aircraft is dependent on maximum utilization of the installed thrust in both the cruise and powered lift modes of flight. An effective thrust vectoring system on the cruise propulsion unit is therefore essential to provide maximum payload in hover and STOL plus minimum specific fuel consumption in loiter and cruise. Introducing a high by-pass ratio fan system, augmenting the gas generator thrust, as the propulsion system for VTOL aircraft places increased significance {{on the performance of}} the relatively <b>short</b> <b>coupled</b> thrust vectoring <b>systems.</b> The two programs discussed herein include both large-scale and small-scale tests of a vectoring hood system with a vented, internal-lip and swivel nozzle systems. These tests indicated that a satisfactory thrust vectoring system can be developed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A <b>coupled</b> <b>system</b> of {{a magnet}} and {{magnetic}} fluid {{is used as}} a piston in a U-tube. Applying reciprocating travelling magnetic field produces reciprocating motion of the <b>coupled</b> <b>system.</b> In this study, vibration properties of the <b>coupled</b> <b>system</b> are investigated experimentally. Three types of vibration mode of the <b>coupled</b> <b>system</b> appear and the mode depends on the frequency and intensity of travelling magnetic field and the shape of the magnet. Basically the <b>coupled</b> <b>system</b> follows the travelling magnetic field in the range of low frequency, while the system cannot follow the travelling field when the frequency of the travelling magnetic field is high. However, when the magnet is sphere or short cylinder, the other type of vibration appears in the range of low frequency and the <b>coupled</b> <b>system</b> intermittently tracks the travelling magnetic field...|$|R

30|$|As {{far as we}} know, {{there are}} a lot of papers dealing with the ISS of {{individual}} control systems but few papers dealing with the ISS of CCSs. In general, the study of ISS for CCSs is complex, because it is very difficult to straightly construct an appropriate Lyapunov function for CCSs. However, in [5], Li and Shuai studied the global-stability problem of equilibrium and developed a systematic approach that allows one to construct global Lyapunov functions for large-scale <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> from building blocks of individual vertex systems. Later, this technique was appropriately developed and extended to some other <b>coupled</b> <b>systems.</b> In [6 – 8] several delayed <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> were discussed, and some sufficient conditions were obtained. Li et al. in [9 – 12] investigated the stochastic stability of <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> with both white noise and color noise. Moreover, by using this technique, Su et al. derived sufficient conditions ensuring global stability of discrete-time <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> [13, 14], and Zhang et al. extended this technique to multi-dispersal <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> [15]. Besides, this technique is also applied to many practical applications, such as biological systems [16 – 18], neural networks [19, 20], and mechanical systems [20 – 23]. Hence, the graph theory is a great method in the study of <b>coupled</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

40|$|Substructure {{decoupling}} {{consists in}} the identification of the dynamic behaviour of a structural subsystem, starting from the dynamic behaviour of both the assembled system and the residual subsystem (the known portion of the assembled system). The degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the <b>coupled</b> <b>system</b> can be partitioned into internal DoFs (not belonging to the couplings) and coupling DoFs. In direct decoupling, a fictitious subsystem that is the negative of the residual subsystem is added to the <b>coupled</b> <b>system,</b> and appropriate compatibility and equilibrium conditions are enforced at interface DoFs. Compatibility and equilibrium can be required either at coupling DoFs only (standard interface), or at additional internal DoFs of the residual subsystem (extended interface), or at some coupling DoFs and some internal DoFs of the residual subsystem (mixed interface). In this paper, a test bench is considered made by a cantilever column with two staggered <b>short</b> arms <b>coupled</b> to a horizontal beam. This involves both flexural and torsional DoFs, on which rotational FRFs are quite difficult to measure. Using a mixed interface, rotational DoFs are neglected and substituted by internal translational DoFs. Experimental results are presented and discussed...|$|R
