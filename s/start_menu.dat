5|$|After {{installation}} of the KB3033055 update for Windows RT 8.1, a desktop <b>Start</b> <b>menu</b> becomes available {{as an alternative to}} Start screen. It is divided into two columns, with one devoted to recent and pinned applications, and one devoted to live tiles. It is similar to, but not identical to, Windows 10's version.|$|E
5|$|Users are {{no longer}} able to {{synchronize}} <b>Start</b> <b>menu</b> layouts across all devices associated with a Microsoft account. A Microsoft developer justified the change by explaining that a user may have different applications they want to emphasize on each device that they use, rather than use the same configuration across each device. The ability to automatically install a Windows Store app across all devices associated with an account was also removed.|$|E
25|$|For {{the same}} reasons related to {{animation}} performance, the color-aware version of ClearType was abandoned in Metro and the Windows 8 (and 10) <b>start</b> <b>menus.</b>|$|R

25|$|Although Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 {{introduced}} {{a new version of}} <b>Start</b> <b>menu,</b> they offered the ability to switch back to this version of <b>Start</b> <b>menu.</b> This version of the <b>Start</b> <b>menu</b> is also available in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. However, it is absent in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and other later Windows releases.|$|E

5000|$|The {{functionality}} {{that was}} discovered and named Master Control Panel or God Mode {{was designed as}} the base folder for searching control panel options using the new <b>start</b> <b>menu's</b> search function. This allows users to type {{what they want to}} do (e. g. “Change screen resolution”) and they will get the right control panel options as search result. The shortcut is implemented by creating a folder with the extension, “” (without quotes). GodMode was the original folder name used when the feature was publicised, but any name can be used. The same functionality can be achieved by creating a standard Windows shortcut with the path “” or by creating a [...] file in a folder that includes the extension's CLSID (Class ID).|$|R
5000|$|WindowBlinds (now re-branded as one word) quickly {{made its}} way to a 1.0 release, driven by the {{requests}} of users to add [...] "freeform skinning" [...] (customizable window border shapes), sounds, and animation. Scrollbars, the task bar, the <b>start</b> button, <b>menu</b> items, the menu itself, and other GUI elements were added later.|$|R
25|$|On Windows 9x and Windows NT {{families}} of Windows operating system, tapping the Windows key by itself traditionally revealed Windows Taskbar (if not visible) {{and opened the}} <b>Start</b> <b>menu.</b> In Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, this key launches the <b>Start</b> <b>menu</b> but doesn't show the taskbar. However, this feature was added back into Windows 10.|$|E
25|$|Users {{can extend}} the {{functionality}} of the manager via a so-called User menu or <b>Start</b> <b>menu</b> and extensions menu.|$|E

5000|$|The NES Advantage {{features}} adjustable turbo {{controls for}} the A and B buttons {{which could be}} toggled on or off with a button; users can adjust {{the rate of the}} turbo (i.e., how quickly the A or B button is pressed) by adjusting the respective turbo dials located above each button. The Advantage features a pseudo-slow motion feature, which users can toggle on and off by pressing the [...] "slow" [...] button. However, the slow motion feature does not work with all games, including games compatible with the NES Zapper or R.O.B. accessories. The slow button works by very rapidly pressing a virtual start button, which could lead to problems when the player attempts to do an action while the game is paused (e.g., jumping or firing). This feature was not compatible with games with <b>start</b> <b>menus</b> or pause screens. The slow motion feature was unique at release, though it became a popular feature on later controllers. The controller has two wires to plug into both controller ports. By toggling a switch between [...] "Player 1" [...] and [...] "Player 2", the Advantage can be shared with another player for games where two players alternate gameplay.|$|R
25|$|Like Windows XP, Windows Vista {{allows users}} to switch back to the {{previous}} version of <b>Start</b> <b>menu,</b> first introduced in Windows 95.|$|E
25|$|Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 {{replaced}} Program Manager with desktop and <b>Start</b> <b>menu.</b> The {{latter was}} comparable {{in some respects}} with the Apple menu in Mac OS operating systems {{and did not have}} the mentioned limitations of Program Manager: Being a menu, it allowed nested grouping while keeping only one group open at the time. Items could also be simply added to the <b>Start</b> <b>menu</b> by dragging and dropping them. The menu also offered the ability to shut down and log off from their computer.|$|E
25|$|The search {{functionality}} {{is exposed}} using the search bars in the <b>Start</b> <b>menu</b> {{and the upper}} right hand corner of Windows Explorer windows, as well as Open/Save dialog boxes. When searching from the <b>Start</b> <b>menu,</b> the results are shown in the <b>Start</b> <b>menu</b> itself, overlapping the recently used programs. From the <b>Start</b> <b>menu,</b> {{it is also possible}} to launch an application by searching for its executable image name or display name. Searching from the search bars in Explorer windows replaces the content of the current folder with the search results. The Explorer windows can also render thumbnails in the search results if a Thumbnail Handler is registered for a particular file type. It can also render enhanced previews of items in a Preview Pane without launching the default application, if the application has registered a Preview Handler. This can provide functionality such as file type-specific navigation (such a browsing a presentation using next/previous controls, or seeking inside a media file). Preview handlers can also allow certain kind of selections (such as highlighting a text snippet) to be performed from the preview pane itself. In the Control Panel, the search bar in the window can also search for Control Panel options. However, unlike WDS, Windows Search does not support creating aliases.|$|E

At {{the beginning of}} each restaurant day, the player gets two options per dish of which one can be chosen according to the customers that are expected that day. In Delicious: Emily's Home Sweet Home, the player <b>starts</b> with <b>menu</b> choices that they can not change. Achieving specific goals in each restaurant unlocks new menu options, then the player can then choose what menu items to use. Most menu items have special bonus: faster preparation, bonus tip, spill proof, or burn proof and some menu items have multiple bonuses.|$|R
50|$|The Windows PC and GBA {{versions}} were negatively received {{because the}} PC version contains StarForce protection {{and it does}} not run on Windows 7 or higher and the GBA version only has 5 games. In Japan, this was released under the title Namco Museum Arcade Hits! for PlayStation 2 only, with Pac-Mania and Galaga '88 unlocked right from the <b>start</b> and different <b>menu</b> music.|$|R
