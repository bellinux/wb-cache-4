The initial {{collection}} was a bequest of 276 theological books from Clement Littill, an advocate who left his collection to the town in 1580. [...] Until 1708, the teaching staff consisted of four regents and the Principal, the former taking each class through a year's {{part of the whole}} arts curriculum of logic, metaphysics, ethics and physics, which included the elements of mathematics and astronomy. Until the middle of the 17th century, by which time the library must have exceeded the 2,400-odd volumes listed in Robert Lumsden's <b>shelf</b> <b>catalogue</b> of 1637, the teaching tended to be commentaries on Aristotle.|$|E
40|$|Libraries library play an {{important}} role for students in their academic programme, Distance Learning students in University of Ibadan were studied to investigate their library habits and factors affecting use of libraries. Purposive sampling technique was adopted for this study to select 100 library registered distance learners from Faculties of Education and Social Sciences. Questionnaire, interview and observation were the instruments employed for the study. Findings revealed that 67. 9 % of the respondents from Education and 62. 5 % from Social Sciences had access to available library resources, while 36 (46. 2 %) from Education and 8 (50 %) Social Sciences used the library twice in a week when they were in session. The major library habits were searching for materials through the <b>shelf,</b> <b>catalogue</b> and using the libraries alone. Respondents from Education and Social Sciences (80. 7 % and 93. 7 %) respectively searched through the shelf, The major factors affecting their use of the library were inadequate reading materials 77 % from Education; 62. 5 % from social Sciences) and their inability to borrow library materials. The maximum use of the library can only be obtained when these students are allowed to borrow library materials and given library use instructions as their full time counterpart...|$|E

Russell, {{but most of}} the action in his art, played out among the cowboys of the open range and the Native peoples of the Northern Plains, unfolds on the flat. Thanks to the comprehensive electronic catalogue of Russell 2 ̆ 7 s paintings, drawings, watercolors, models in mixed mediums, and illustrated letters available with this print publication, the reader can verify these assertions without tipping a single book off the library <b>shelf.</b> <b>Catalogues</b> raisonnes have always stimulated the discovery of lost works and the reattribution and redating of others, and such new findings, along with the workings of the art market, have rendered these massive publications out of date almost as soon as printed. This near-instant obsolescence has finally been defeated by on-line technology, which also facilitates a host of additional benefits, many of which can be enjoyed in this publication. One can search this catalogue by title, date, collection, medium, and provenance; trace the compositional evolution of a specific subject; review every work from a single year; and examine from afar all the Russells (bronzes excepted) in a particular collection. Unlike the weighty multi-volume catalogue raisonne of yore, this one is as easily portable as a laptop computer...|$|R

2500|$|The Golan Heights, {{occupied}} by Israel since the Six-Day War in 1967, are located northeast of Israel proper, though Israel considers it a sub-region of the Galilee. The political {{status of the}} Golan Heights has resulted in controversy on the export market. In one example, following domestic demand for kosher wine, a number of Golan Heights wines were marketed by Systembolaget, Sweden's state-owned monopoly alcohol retailer, as [...] "Made in Israel" [...] on shelves and in the sales catalogue. Following customer complaints and consultation with Sweden's foreign ministry, Systembolaget changed the shelf labelling to read, [...] "Made in Israeli-occupied Syrian territories." [...] However this prompted further complaints, from some customers and a Member of Parliament. Systembolaget's solution was to simply remove all reference to the product's country of origin on <b>shelves</b> and in <b>catalogues,</b> classifying the wine as of [...] "other origins." [...] The actual bottles remained unchanged throughout the controversy, and carried the producer's English-language labels.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} information needs and seeking behaviour of undergraduate {{students in the}} library of Federal University of Technology and Imo State University library, Owerri using a comparative approach. The instrument used for the study was the student questionnaire. One thousand, one hundred and fifty two usable responses from each of the two institutions compared in the study were analysed by the use of frequency counts and percentages. A descriptive survey research design was adopted in the study; a purposive sampling technique was adopted. The undergraduate students in Federal University of Technology, Owerri sought for information in relation to their academic and research needs while in Imo State University sought for information resources on academic / research information, business information and industrial attachment/ employment information. The undergraduates in the Federal university of technology consulted <b>shelves</b> and <b>catalogues</b> to foster information seeking behaviour while in Imo State University, the undergraduates browse through the shelves signifying that the former utilized catalogues more significantly than the latter. Major reasons for seeking for information amongst undergraduate in FUTO include updating of knowledge and development of personal competencies, while that of IMSU include updating of knowledge, when carrying research, development of personal competencies and writing of assignment, the type of information resources mostly consulted by undergraduates in FUTO is the textbook, while that of IMSU is textbooks, periodical journals, reference books and project report. In FUTO the major militating factor affecting information needs and seeking behaviour was inadequate information resources while in IMSU inadequate information resources, inadequate qualified librarians and lack of time to access the information resources affected the information needs and seeking behaviour of students. Introduction of computerized or digital catalogues should be provided and made available to enable the students have access to information resources librarians should embrace effective management and use of ICT facilities to promote satisfaction of information needs and seeking behaviour of the students...|$|R
5000|$|For {{some years}} he was usefully {{employed}} in compiling a complete catalogue of the books, arranged in two parts, one under an alphabet of authors, and the other according {{to the position of}} the volumes on the <b>shelves.</b> The <b>catalogue</b> was printed in 1791, and described 20,000 volumes. It gave much satisfaction. Arthur was appointed assistant professor in moral philosophy through the influence of Dr. Thomas Reid, who was obliged to give up his full professorial duties on account of increasing years. This took place in May 1780, and Arthur taught the class for fifteen years in return for part of the salary. On the death of Reid, he was elected full professor, but held the office only for one session, dying on 14 June 1797. He never married, and died worth a considerable sum of money, which he left to his brothers and sisters. They devoted part of it to the publication of his posthumous [...] "Discourses on Theological and Literary Subjects", which were edited, with a pompous memoir, by his friend William Richardson. The theological discourses include one on the argument for the existence of God, another on the goodness of God, and others on objections to David Hume, and similar topics; among the literary discourses are two upon theories of beauty, one on the arrangement of ancient and modern languages, and others on the study of ancient languages as a necessary branch of liberal education. They are fairly well written and well reasoned essays. Arthur had a shy and hesitating manner, but possessed liberal opinions to which he always had the courage to hold firm. A. F. Tytler, in a note upon a letter of Dr. Reid, remarks: [...] "Mr. Arthur, a man of learning, abilities, and worth, filled the chair of moral philosophy … with a reputation which did not disappoint the hopes of his respectable predecessor". The Discourses [...] "give a very favourable idea of his talents, the justness of his taste, and the rectitude of his moral and religious principles".|$|R
40|$|Introduction In May, 2006, the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) Library {{submitted}} a project proposal titled 2 ̆ 2 Automation of the KNUST Library system toward effective {{science and technology}} research 2 ̆ 2 to the Teaching and Learning Innovation Fund (TALIF) to solicit funding to undertake a library automation project. The idea to automate its services, resources and operations {{is part of the}} re-engineering processes by the KNUST Library to provide the platform to offer efficient and effective e-service to its ever growing users. In November, 2006, the project contract was awarded to Nala Consultancy Services for work to commence. Currently the automation process, according to the systems librarian, is about ninety percent complete. With the completion of the automation network it was imperative to feed it with the necessary data to make it operational. Starting from 11 th May, 2009 to August, 2009, the Library embarked on a seventy day massive exercise of stocktaking, relabeling, bar coding and accessioning of the library resources to generate the requisite data. Stocktaking or stock inventory is done for various reasons. According to New South Wales Department of Education and Training (2000) and Braxton (2004) stock is taken, among other reasons, to assess, control and evaluate the resources; track purchases, losses and disposals; to provide information on weaknesses in the collection that need redressing; measure the collection numbers, age and ratio: student; examine each resource and determine its future based on age, relevance, currency and condition, which may include repair, replacement, disposal or cleaning, to ensure that attractive, up-to-date resources are available to users; and prioritize future purchases and begin sourcing these. Reporting on the stocktake project of the Whitireia Community Polytechnic, New Zealand, Parker (2007) expounds on the aim, preparation and planning, method, results and problems of the project. She ends with a nine-point recommendation. The highlights of the project are that it was aimed at identifying the amount of loss since 2000 (the last stocktake) and to match <b>shelves</b> with the <b>catalogue.</b> Stocktake was done mainly electronically and during the quiet Christmas period. A missing rate of 3...|$|R
