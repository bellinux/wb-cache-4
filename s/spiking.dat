5|$|Although {{historically}} Metro has had {{a significantly}} lower crime rate than any comparable transit system in the United States, crime on Metro {{as a whole was}} rising in the late 2000s. Crime on the transit system began <b>spiking</b> in 2008 and 2009. Robbery rose by 30 percent to 581 incidents in 2008, and in the first four months of 2009 rose another 28.3 percent to 240 robberies. Crime on the Green Line continued to be high: Gallery Place–Chinatown had the most robberies of any station throughout the Metro system, followed by Anacostia (25 percent fewer than Gallery Place) and L'Enfant Plaza (20 percent fewer than Anacostia). Crime by juveniles (generally robbery, or assault) also continued to be a serious issue for Metro, with more than 260 juvenile arrests {{in the first nine months}} of 2009, and Metro Transit Police continued to engage in large numbers of high-visibility patrols. Anacostia, Fort Totten, Gallery Place–Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and Minnesota Avenue continued to be trouble spots, and Metro added Metro Center to the list in 2009.|$|E

Two of them are biologically inspired <b>spike</b> based coding systems i. e. the <b>spikes</b> are generated {{in a similar way}} to how our auditory nerves generate <b>spikes.</b> They have been called AN (Auditory Nerve) <b>spikes</b> and AN Onset (Amplitude Modulated Onset) <b>spikes.</b> Sounds have been re-generated from <b>spikes</b> generated by both of those <b>spike</b> coding technique.

40|$|Objective: Ripples (80 - 250. Hz) {{have been}} shown to be a more {{specific}} biomarker for the epileptogenic zone than epileptic <b>spikes</b> in intracranial EEG and even surface EEG. Ripples often co-occur with <b>spikes.</b> We investigated the spatiotemporal relation between <b>spikes</b> and ripples, and differences between <b>spikes</b> that do and do not co-occur with ripples. Methods: We marked 50 time points with <b>spikes</b> in bipolar surface EEG during NREM sleep in patients with focal or multifocal epilepsy. We marked ripples that occurred with <b>spikes</b> and calculated parameters relating <b>spikes</b> and ripples: the duration, amplitude and slope of <b>spikes,</b> the timing of the start of ripples and <b>spikes</b> and the proportion of overlap. Results: In total 219 ripples and 5995 individual <b>spikes</b> were marked in 31 patients. <b>Spikes</b> with ripples were on average shorter, had higher amplitude and higher slope than <b>spikes</b> without ripples. 64 % of ripples started before <b>spikes</b> started. <b>Spikes</b> occurred on 13 (5 - 26) channels per patient, and ripples on 3 (0 - 14) channels, which were also <b>spike</b> channels. Conclusion: Ripples precede rather than follow <b>spikes,</b> so ripples are unlikely to result from <b>spikes.</b> Significance: Ripples and <b>spikes</b> seem not one-on-one coupled, but certain states of the brain can accommodate both...|$|R
40|$|Cerebellar Purkinje cells receive two {{different}} excitatory inputs from parallel and climbing fibers, causing simple and complex <b>spikes,</b> respectively. Purkinje cells present three modes of simple <b>spike</b> firing, namely tonic, silent and bursting. The influence of complex <b>spike</b> firing on simple <b>spike</b> firing {{has been extensively}} studied. However, it is unknown whether and how the simple <b>spike</b> firing mode may influence complex <b>spike</b> waveform and firing rate in vivo. We studied complex <b>spike</b> firing during tonic and silent mode periods in non-anesthetized mice. We found that complex <b>spike</b> firing rate is not influenced by simple <b>spike</b> firing modes, but that the complex <b>spike</b> waveform is altered following high frequency simple <b>spike</b> firing. This alteration is a specific decrement of the second depolarizing component of the complex <b>spike.</b> We demonstrate that the amplitude of the second depolarizing component is inversely proportional to the simple <b>spike</b> firing rate preceding the complex <b>spike</b> and that this amplitude is independent of previous complex <b>spike</b> firing.

5|$|The {{attack on}} the gap began at 7:30am on 11 August, as a flight of Savioa-Marchetti SM.81 medium bombers {{attacked}} British defenders on Punjab Ridge. This half-hour assault {{was followed by a}} long artillery bombardment lasting until noon. At 12:30, the infantry attack began. II Brigade began moving slowly towards the Indians through the trackless wilderness north of the road, XIV Brigade attacked Mill, Knobbly, and Observation Hills, and XV Brigade clambered atop Punjab Ridge, engaging its defenders. The attacks of XIV Brigade against the Rhodesians failed, but XV Brigade managed to drive off the Indian defenders of Punjab Ridge. Counterattacks were mounted against the Italians, but these were unsuccessful. The Italian {{attack on the}} hills was renewed the next day, 12 August.

5|$|Nearly {{one-third of}} the world's {{tropical}} cyclones form within the western Pacific. This makes this basin the most active on Earth. Pacific typhoons have formed year round, with peak months from August to October. The peak months correspond {{to that of the}} Atlantic hurricane seasons. Along with a high storm frequency, this basin also features the most globally intense storms on record. One of the most recent busy seasons was 2013. Tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest Pacific Ocean, and concentrate around June and November in the northern Indian Ocean. The area just northeast of the Philippines is the most active place on Earth for tropical cyclones to exist. Across the Philippines themselves, activity reaches a minimum in February, before increasing steadily through June, and <b>spiking</b> from July through October, with September being the most active month for tropical cyclones across the archipelago. Activity falls off significantly in November, although Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest Philippine typhoon on record, was a November typhoon. The most frequently impacted areas of the Philippines by tropical cyclones are northern and central Luzon and eastern Visayas. A ten-year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones, while the southern islands receive less than 10percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones. The genesis and intensity of typhoons are also modulated by slow variation of the sea surface temperature and circulation features following a near-10-year frequency.|$|E
5|$|The episode relates three {{parallel}} plots, in intertwining scenes. The first plot concerns George being {{banned from}} the executive toilet. Because of this he quits his job, but immediately regrets the decision. He discusses job opportunities with Jerry, but is unable to think of an occupation that would suit him. Jerry suggests that George could try {{to go back to}} work and pretend he never quit. George takes this advice, but his former boss, Rick Levitan (Fred Applegate), refuses to let him stay and insults him. As revenge, George decides to slip a Mickey Finn into his drink during an office party, and enlists Elaine Benes to help him. At the party, Elaine distracts Levitan while George puts the mickey in his drink. When Levitan notices George, however, he decides he was unreasonable and tells George he can have his job back. George attempts to intercept the drink, but after Levitan welcomes him back with a toast sprinkled with insults at George's expense, he changes his mind. In the following scene we see George once again brainstorming job opportunity ideas, the subtext being that his boss discovered the <b>spiking</b> of his drink, connected it to George, and has fired him once again.|$|E

40|$|<b>Spike</b> {{trains are}} unreliable. For example, {{in the primary}} sensory areas, <b>spike</b> {{patterns}} and precise <b>spike</b> times will vary between responses to the same stimulus. Nonetheless, information about sensory inputs is communicated {{in the form of}} <b>spike</b> trains. A challenge in understanding <b>spike</b> trains is to assess the significance of individual <b>spikes</b> in encoding information. One approach is to define a <b>spike</b> train metric, allowing a distance to be calculated between pairs of <b>spike</b> trains. In a good metric, this distance will depend on the information the <b>spike</b> trains encode. This method has been used previously to calculate the timescale over which the precision of <b>spike</b> times is significant. Here, a new metric is constructed based on a simple model of synaptic conductances which includes binding site depletion. Including binding site depletion in the metric means that a given individual <b>spike</b> has a smaller effect on the distance if it occurs soon after other <b>spikes.</b> The metric proves effective at classifying neuronal responses by stimuli in the sample data set of electro-physiological recordings from the primary auditory area of the zebra finch fore-brain. This shows that this is an effective metric for these <b>spike</b> trains suggesting that in these <b>spike</b> trains the significance of a <b>spike</b> is modulated by its proximity to previous <b>spikes.</b> This modulation is a putative information-coding property of <b>spike</b> trains...|$|R

40|$|In many {{principal}} brain neurons, the fast, all-or-none Na � <b>spike</b> initiated at {{the proximal}} axon {{is followed by}} a slow, graded afterdepolarization (ADP). The <b>spike</b> ADP is critically important in determining the firing mode of many neurons; large ADPs cause neurons to fire bursts of <b>spikes</b> rather than solitary <b>spikes.</b> Nonetheless, not much is known about how and where <b>spike</b> ADPs are initiated. We addressed these questions in adult CA 1 pyramidal cells, which manifest conspicuous somatic <b>spike</b> ADPs and an associated propensity for bursting, using sharp and patch microelectrode recordings in acutely isolated hippocampal slices and single neurons. Voltage-clamp commands mimicking <b>spike</b> waveforms evoked transient Na � <b>spike</b> currents that declined quickly after the <b>spike</b> but were followed by substantial sustained Na � <b>spike</b> aftercurrents. Drugs that blocked the persistent Na � current (INaP), markedly suppressed the sustained Na � <b>spike</b> aftercurrents, as well as <b>spike</b> ADPs and associated bursting. Ca 2 � <b>spike</b> aftercurrents were much smaller, and reducing them had no noticeable effect on the <b>spike</b> ADPs. Truncating the apical dendrites affected neither <b>spike</b> ADPs nor the firing modes of these neurons. Application of INaP blockers to truncated neurons, or their focal application to the somatic region of intact neurons, suppressed <b>spike</b> ADPs and associated bursting, whereas their focal application to distal dendrites did not. We conclude that the somatic <b>spike</b> ADPs are generated predominantly by persistent Na � channels located at or near the soma.
