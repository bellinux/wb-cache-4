5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as others view them, so in essence they attempt to <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> {{as if they are}} outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E
5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers to be able to <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E
5|$|Theatre also greatly {{influenced}} Alejo Carpentier's work. In all his work, Carpentier uses the characters he creates {{to explore the}} notions of subjectivity and identity, analyzing {{the way in which}} individuals <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> and others within cultural settings. In order to achieve such an analysis, Carpentier makes use of spectatorship: his characters perceive a spectacle in alterable ways which parallel their alterable ways of experiencing the world. Spectacle situations are also sometimes used by Carpentier as a tool for the characters to reframe and rethink the world, as well as to establish individual and group identity.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Modern Syria {{was first}} {{established}} in 1920 as the Arab Kingdom of Syria under King Faisal. This state was {{planned to be}} a new Arab kingdom, and not just Syrian, and the state espoused Arab nationalism and pan-Islamic policies. However the British, who had helped establish the state after World War I, made a secret agreement with France and established the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The area thereby functioned as one of France's colonies, and the newly established state was viewed unfavorably by most Syrians, with many of them regarding it as a vessel of European imperialism. At this stage, some movements tried to establish a Syrian identity, most notably the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, or became advocates of communism and Islamism. The majority of Syrians continued to <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as Arabs rather than Syrians.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} the Danelaw by West Saxon kings had united England in a single kingdom for the first time, {{enabling}} kings from Æthelstan onwards to <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as heirs of the Carolingian emperors; the regulation of monasteries by a uniform Benedictine rule was designed to unite the kingdom ideologically and enhance royal prestige. The monks depended on the king {{in a way that}} the local ealdormen did not, so their loyalty could be trusted and they could act as a counterbalance to powerful local families. The Regularis Concordia required that psalms be said for the king and the queen in monasteries several times a day, and specified that royal consent must be obtained for the election of abbots. The reformers aimed to enhance the Christian character of kingship, and one aspect of this was to raise the status of the queen; Edgar's last wife, Ælfthryth, was the first king's consort to regularly witness charters as regina.|$|E
60|$|Q. How do you mean?--A. I mean if {{they have}} <b>seen</b> <b>themselves</b> {{delivered}} from this state, by being by the Word and Spirit of God implanted into the faith of Christ (Rom 11:17-19).|$|R

25|$|Olivier Roy {{indicates}} that for first generation immigrants, {{the fact that}} they are Muslims is only one element among others.

25|$|Northern Ireland {{was created}} in 1921, when Ireland was {{partitioned}} between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Unlike Southern Ireland, which would become the Irish Free State in 1922, the majority of Northern Ireland's population were unionists, who wanted to remain within the United Kingdom. Most of these were the Protestant descendants of colonists from Great Britain. However, a significant minority, mostly Catholics, were nationalists who wanted a united Ireland independent of British rule. Today, the former generally <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as British and the latter generally <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as Irish, while a distinct Northern Irish or Ulster identity is claimed both by a large minority of Catholics and Protestants and by {{many of those who}} are non-aligned.|$|E
25|$|The major benefit, however, {{is related}} to {{language}} exposure. As pointed out by Tokuhama-Espinosa, language opens the doors to new realms including that of new cultures. TCKs, through prolonged exposure to native language use, can thus also learn to <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> {{through the eyes of}} others.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} groups of Martins or Macmartins in Scotland. The MacMartins of Letterfinlay {{appear to have}} allied {{themselves}} to the Clan Cameron in the late 14th century, and finally merged with the Camerons after the Battle of Lochaber in 1429. The MacMartins, who became a sept of Clan Cameron, {{are said to have}} been amongst the most loyal and valuable followers of Cameron of Lochiel. In the Jacobite rising of 1745, the MacMartins were [...] "out with" [...] Lochiel's regiment. According to the Oxford Companion to Scottish History, the MacMartins of Letterfinlay who were a sept of the Clan Cameron would have <b>seen</b> <b>themselves</b> as distinct within their own lands, but would have also <b>seen</b> <b>themselves</b> as Camerons if operating elsewhere outside of Lochaber.|$|R

25|$|Orthodox Judaism. Orthodox Jews {{generally}} <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as practicing normative Judaism, {{rather than}} {{belonging to a}} particular movement.

They kept close to the shore by erecting houses on stilts, and travelled using lepa, handmade boats which many lived in.|$|E
25|$|In Turkey, the claimed messiah Sabbatai Zevi {{was forced}} to convert to Islam in 1668. Most of his {{followers}} abandoned him, but several thousand converted to Islam as well, while continuing to <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> as Jews. They {{became known as the}} Dönmeh (a Turkish word for a religious convert). Some Dönmeh remain today, primarily in Turkey.|$|E

25|$|In the 1650s {{after the}} Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Catholics were banned from {{dwelling}} {{within the city}} limits under the vengeful Cromwellian settlement but this law was not strictly enforced. Ultimately, this religious discrimination led to the Old English community abandoning their English roots and coming to <b>see</b> <b>themselves</b> {{as part of the}} native Irish community.|$|E
25|$|The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) is an international, clandestine leaderless {{resistance}} that engages in direct action {{in pursuit of}} animal rights.

50|$|In {{the context}} of Scottish clans, septs are {{families}} that followed another family's chief. These smaller septs would then comprise, and be part of, the chief's larger clan. A sept might follow another chief if two families were linked through marriage; or, if a family lived on the land of a powerful laird, they would follow him whether they were related or not. Bonds of manrent were sometimes used to bind lesser chiefs and his followers to more powerful chiefs. According to the Oxford Companion to Scottish History, the MacMartins of Letterfinlay who were a sept of the Clan Cameron would have <b>seen</b> <b>themselves</b> as distinct within their own lands, but would have also <b>seen</b> <b>themselves</b> as Camerons if operating elsewhere outside of Lochaber. Bonds of manrent and friendship tied obviously non-related kin groups into a wider military, political, and land/food resource sharing clanship.|$|R
