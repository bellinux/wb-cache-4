The deal included a vesting option for 2019 worth $24 million. If the option didn't vest, it would have turned into a club option for $20 million that included a $6 million buyout.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Giridhar narrated a Katha on Ramcharitmanas to Swami Karpatri, {{who advised}} {{him not to}} marry, to <b>stay</b> <b>a</b> lifelong Brahmachari (celibate bachelor) and to take {{initiation}} in a Vaishnava Sampradaya (a sect worshipping Vishnu, Krishna, or Rama as the supreme God). Giridhar took vairagi (renouncer) initiation or Virakta Diksha in the Ramananda Sampradaya on the Kartika full-moon day of 19 November 1983 from Shri Ramcharandas Maharaj Phalahari. He now {{came to be known}} as Rambhadradas.|$|E
5|$|After a {{few more}} adventures, Candide and Cacambo wander into El Dorado, a {{geographically}} isolated utopia where the streets are covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, {{and all of the}} king's jokes are funny. Candide and Cacambo <b>stay</b> <b>a</b> month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cunégonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.|$|E

5|$|Oppenheimer brought {{together}} intellectuals {{at the height}} of their powers and from a variety of disciplines to answer the most pertinent questions of the age. He directed and encouraged the research of many well-known scientists, including Freeman Dyson, and the duo of Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of parity non-conservation. He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as T. S. Eliot and George F. Kennan. Some of these activities were resented by a few members of the mathematics faculty, who wanted the institute to <b>stay</b> <b>a</b> bastion of pure scientific research. Abraham Pais said that Oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at the institute was being unable to bring together scholars from the natural sciences and the humanities.|$|E
5|$|Reitz did not <b>stay</b> <b>a</b> {{private person}} for long. A {{conflict}} between the South African Republic legislature and judiciary resulted in the dismissal of the Chief Justice. Reitz then took up an appointment as judge in early 1898 and quickly {{became part of the}} inner circle of the Transvaal administration. At the time the relationship with the British was already rapidly deteriorating and the government of the South African Republic was taking action to reinforce its national and international position. One of the measures taken was to replace State Secretary W.J. Leyds, who had the Dutch nationality, with a South African. Leyds was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Europe to represent the Republic abroad. Reitz took his place as State Secretary in June 1898, after Abraham Fischer had declined.|$|E

We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, coming out of her head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E
5|$|Government {{troops were}} {{stationed}} at Aberdour Castle during the Jacobite Rising of 1715. During their <b>stay,</b> <b>a</b> second fire again caused extensive damage. In 1725, the Mortons bought an adjacent property, Cuttlehill House, which they renamed Aberdour House, and the castle {{ceased to be}} a residence. The east range was again repaired, and was used for various purposes, including a school room, a barracks, and a masonic hall. In 1924 the castle and gardens were placed in state care, and continue to be managed by Historic Scotland as a visitor attraction. The south-east wing was initially restored as a home for the custodian, and now houses a cafe. The castle is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and the castle, dovecot and walled garden are Category A listed buildings, the highest level of protection for a historic building in Scotland. The grounds, and surrounding former parks, are listed on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, the national register of significant gardens.|$|E
5|$|Prescott {{found it}} {{difficult}} to evaluate Mesoamerican scientific and mathematical achievements, because of his relative ignorance of those subjects. While working in Boston in 1841, he met George Howard, who was to <b>stay</b> <b>a</b> close friend for the remainder of his life. Prescott worked industriously throughout 1840–1842, and as a result, the work was finished by August 1843. It was published by Harper & Brothers, New York in December, Bentley issuing the British edition. His elderly father had suffered a stroke in October, which resulted in temporary paralysis, so Prescott spent most of the winter attending him in Pepperell. The History of the Conquest of Mexico was received extremely well, both critically and by the general public, despite Prescott's fears to the contrary. Those praising the work included George Hillard in the North American Review, George Ticknor Curtis in the Christian Examiner, Joseph Cogswell in the Methodist Quarterly, as well as the Dean of St. Paul's, Henry Hart Milman in the Quarterly Review.|$|E

5|$|The first European {{visitor to}} publish {{an account of}} Quiriguá was English {{architect}} and artist Frederick Catherwood, who reached the ruins in 1840. The previous landowner, by the surname of Payés, had related {{the existence of the}} ruins to his sons and to Carlos Meiney, a Jamaican Englishman resident in Guatemala. The elder Payés had recently died and passed the land to his sons and, since neither Meiney nor Payés' sons had visited the land containing the ruins, they invited John Lloyd Stephens and Catherwood to join them on their first trip to the site. Stephens had other duties to attend to, but Catherwood was able to accompany the Payés brothers to Quiriguá. Due to adverse conditions he was only able to <b>stay</b> <b>a</b> short time at the ruins, but made drawings of two of the stelae, which were published with a short account of Catherwood's visit in John Lloyd Stephens's book Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan in 1841. Quiriguá was the first site that Stephens and Catherwood could claim to have discovered themselves. A longer account of the ruins was made in 1854 by Dr. Karl Scherzer.|$|E

After this, Marian invited the two men to <b>stay</b> <b>a</b> few days {{at her home in}} Haverford where she, her son Jack, and other passengers from the Titanic expressed their gratitude for their help.|$|E
25|$|In June 1966, Manson was sent, for {{the second}} time in his life, to Terminal Island, in {{preparation}} for early release. By March 21, 1967, his release day, he had spent more than half of his 32 years in prisons and other institutions. This was mainly because he had broken a number of federal laws. Then as now, federal sentences were much more severe than state sentences for many of the same offenses. Telling the authorities that prison had become his home, he requested permission to <b>stay,</b> <b>a</b> fact mentioned in a 1981 television interview with Tom Snyder.|$|E
