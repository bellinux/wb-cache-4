40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{efficient}} coding and design styles using verilog. This can be immensely helpful for any digital designer initiating designs. Here, we address different problems ranging from RTL-Gate Level simulation mismatch to race conditions in writing behavioral models. All {{these problems are}} accompanied by an example {{to have a better}} idea, and these can be taken care off if these coding guidelines are followed. Discussion of all the techniques {{is beyond the scope of}} this paper, however, here we try to cover a few of them. 1. Reading a variable before assigning- Simulation and Synthesis mismatch Non-Blocking statements within the always block are executed sequentially. This becomes an issue when variables are used in the always block. Variables may be used in some conditional expression or on the right hand side of an assignment statement besides being assigned some value. Now if they are used prior to being assigned, a mismatch may occur in simulation and synthesis. For pre-synthesis simulation, that variable will contain the value assigned to it in the previous pass but it may not happen in gate level simulation. This can be illustrated by means of a very simple example. In module example 1, “Z ” is declared as a register. It is being used in the right hand side of an assignment statement before being assigned a value in the next <b>statement.</b> <b>Register</b> “Z ” will hold the value of the previous pass until the assignment statement for “Z ” is executed, thus, output “Q ” will be assigned a stale value in the current pass. The module example 1 was simulated using VCS and the results are as shown in Fig. 1 a. It is clearly understood by seeing the waveform that by change in any input, output “Q ” gets the stale value assigned to register “Z ” in the previous pass. module example 1 (A, B, Q); input A, B; output Q; reg Z; alway...|$|E

40|$|Spiral {{force was}} written in 1979 for the Young Musicians Foundation Competition and was awarded the Willard and Minna Coe Composition Prize. It was premiered by the YMF Debut Orchestra on April 13, 1980 at Royce Hall, UCLA. The most {{important}} and dominating structural tool {{in the composition of}} Spiral Force is the use of a nearly chromatic five note group of pitches (B, C, C#, D#, E). These pitches are free to appear in any order, instrumental combination, or octave transposition and always appear in a rising fifths transposition pattern with one exception. The triton transposition is occasionally used because it is the only group that does not repeat a pitch when combined. All melodic and harmonic actions are strictly governed by the underlying structure. It was my goal to create a unified work with limited pitch and transpositional structure, and to achieve a consistency from an overall perspective. My objective was realized by means of manipulation and treatments of the pitch group, variety in harmonic, dynamic, and textural elements, and repetition, often varied, of formal, sectional, and thematic behavior. Spiral Force begins with a section shaped by sustained pitches in a dynamic canon. This passage is characterized by a symmetrical crescendo-diminuendo action within the range of ppp to mf. Although this is of prominent structural significance in the work, it serves here as an accompaniment pattern for a melodic statement (in horns) at the triton transposition. After a repetition in an antecedent-consequent form, it is interrupted by a sudden massive furiouso lasting only one measure (m. 21). This contains a rapid rhythmic figure with five attacks which becomes increasingly dominant throughout the course of the work. Later repetitions are expanded to include an extreme high register followed by an extreme low. The other section of special formal importance is an agitato in the woodwinds (m. 32). It is a polyphonic texture in a five beat repetitive pattern. This section is later expanded to twice the length, combined with pitched percussion, harp and piano, and features some palindromic writing. Spiral Force effectively fuses its fundamental elements. The five note pitch structure, five note rhythmic figure, melodic <b>statements,</b> <b>register</b> and dynamic extremes are combined and consolidated. As a whole, the work is a study of limitations and consistency, getting the most from the least to result in a logical coherence, an agreement, a compatibility...|$|R

Research purpose: The study aimed to provide information about coverage, service delivery, organisational resources, and medium-term outcomes for a supervisory development programme (SDP) in the hospitality industry. Motivation for the study: The primary motivation was to assist programme staff to understand their programme and also to generate information that the programme staff could use to reflect on the programme’s performance and future direction. Research design, approach and method: A mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed, namely: a literature review; personal interviews; and internal programme documentation, such as e-mail correspondence, financial <b>statements,</b> attendance <b>registers,</b> and personnel records. Personal interviews were conducted with two stakeholders, namely the programme manager and programme administrator. The programme data of 69 participants in the SDP were utilised for the evaluation. Main findings: The evaluation’s main finding concluded that the ‘implemented programme’ was not congruent with the ‘planned programme’. Practical/managerial implications: It is recommended that programme activities and theory should be re-evaluated, as the programme is used mainly as a training programme for new appointees, rather than a management development programme to create a pool of potential supervisors. Programme uptake and output should also be closely aligned. The length of time that people in the pool of potential supervisors had to wait before they were appointed should also be reduced. Contribution/value-add: By explicating the basic programme theory and studying programme implementation, this evaluation serves as a starting point for future evaluations of the SDP. </p...|$|R

Faculty were considerably more skeptical of the values to be gained from the time and effort expended on intercollegiate athletics, while student-athletes consider these same expenditures to be not only valuable, but on an equal plane with those made in the academic realm. Presidents and student-athletes demonstrated perceptual similarities on those statements that examined the perceptions of the relative importance of intercollegiate athletics in relation life on NESCAC campuses. ^ Follow-up interviews with presidents were held to collect qualitative data to formulate a more complete picture of conference-wide attitudes and perceptions. Presidents were chosen to be interviewed because they have the most power and influence over the formation of intercollegiate athletic policy as outlined in the conference bylaws. Findings from these interviews indicate that perceptual “sub-groups” exist amongst the presidents. These perceptual sub-groups can be defined as “promoters,” “acceptors,” and “doubters. ” Presidents in each sub-group maintain that NESCAC reflects their own personal notions of the classic and ideal role of intercollegiate athletics, believe that the above cited classic and ideal perceptions are under fire and are increasingly difficult to maintain, and declare that NESCAC has not been immune to the growing interest and emphasis in sport in American society. In addition, many presidents were surprised at the level of significance attributed to and required for the management of intercollegiate athletic policy and were therefore unprepared to deal with the increased managerial expectations and attention required to deal with athletic policy issues. ...|$|R

Variations in wind speed WS and direction were expressed in blood pressure changes and in exacerbation of discomfort of various degrees. Unfavorable conditions correspond to days with dominant desert air streams and to high WS, when N PR reaches 85. 7 %; during the days with prevalent sea breeze N PR was ≤ 22. 9 %.

The method of this study might give to family doctors some additional tools to predict deterioration in general feelings of chronic patients and could be related to other health problems influenced by the meteorological environment. </p...|$|R
