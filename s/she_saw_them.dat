25|$|In 1987, {{seven years}} {{after the release of}} the motion picture, Simon Hawke {{produced}} a novelization of Friday the 13th. One of the few additions to the book was Mrs. Voorhees begging the Christy family to take her back after the loss of her son; they agreed. Another addition in the novel is more understanding in Mrs. Voorhees' actions. Hawke felt the character had attempted to move on when Jason died, but her psychosis got the best of her. When Steve Christy reopened the camp, Mrs. Voorhees saw it as a chance that what happened to her son could happen again. Her murders were against the counselors, because <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> all as responsible for Jason's death.|$|E
25|$|Bianca {{finds out}} that Reese was once engaged to a man and that she is Reese's first lesbian partner. She is hurt Reese did not tell her this. She also becomes {{increasingly}} insecure in their relationship as she sees her fiance getting closer with Zach. Bianca decides to test Reese's love for her. She tells Zach and Reese {{that she will be}} leaving town, but she secretly stays to spy on them. When Bianca witnesses Zach and Reese in an embrace as Zach gives Reese a kiss to the forehead, she believes Reese is cheating on her and flees. She ends up in a car accident soon afterward, but suffers no serious injuries. Zach and Reese rush to the hospital to see Bianca, and Bianca explains that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> embracing. She asks if they are in love. Zach and Reese say no. Despite this, Bianca is furious with Reese and does not want to talk with her. Reese frustratedly leaves the hospital and sends Bianca a note saying she plans to leave. After reading the note, Bianca hurries home to convince Reese to stay; she says that she loves her and knows that she is not romantically interested in Zach. Reese says that she would not have left, regardless.|$|E
500|$|Tubman's {{religious}} faith was another important resource as she ventured repeatedly into Maryland. The visions from her childhood head injury continued, and <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> as divine premonitions. She spoke of [...] "consulting with God", and trusted that He {{would keep her}} safe. Thomas Garrett once said of her, [...] "I never met with any person of any color who had more confidence {{in the voice of}} God, as spoken direct to her soul." [...] Her faith in the divine also provided immediate assistance. She used spirituals as coded messages, warning fellow travelers of danger or to signal a clear path.|$|E
60|$|His hand closed sympathetically on {{her bare}} forearm, {{and as she}} looked down to greet his eyes <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>them</b> {{surprise}} and delight.|$|R
6000|$|I {{winced at}} the fair show of the scene in Mrs. Grose's face; she looked for a minute as if <b>she</b> sharply <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> together. [...] "And him who thinks so well of you!" ...|$|R
60|$|This delighted Miss Celia; and <b>she</b> gladly <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> ramble off together, {{leaving her}} time to stitch happily at certain dainty bits of sewing, write voluminous letters, or dream over others quite as long, {{swinging}} in her hammock under the lilacs.|$|R
2500|$|In their Seventies heyday Dragon were regulars on the teen-oriented {{national}} TV pop show Countdown, which greatly enhanced {{their sales}} and popularity, and Marc Hunter hosted {{the show on}} several occasions, but the band's darker side, and especially Marc's unpredictable stage behaviour, were often in evidence at their live performances. Singer and actress Jane Clifton (who played Margo Gaffney in Prisoner) relates a time when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> live: ...|$|E
2500|$|Gentrification {{also was}} caused, however, by [...] "the {{completely}} unexpected influx of affluent residents {{back into the}} inner city". The extent to which her ideas facilitated this phenomenon {{was at the time}} unimaginable. For example, she advocated the preservation of older buildings specifically because their lack of economic value made them affordable for poor people. In this respect, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> as [...] "guarantors of social diversity" [...] (Klemek, 2011:76). That many of these older structures have increased in economic value solely due to their age was implausible in 1961. Issues of gentrification have dominated criticism of Jane Jacobs’ planning ideas.|$|E
2500|$|Franck {{was well}} known for her documentary-style {{photographs}} of important cultural figures such as painter Marc Chagall, philosopher Michel Foucault and poet Seamus Heaney, and of remote or marginalized communities such as Tibetan Buddhist monks, elderly French people, and isolated Gaelic speakers. Michael Pritchard, the Director-General of the Royal Photographic Society, observed: [...] "Martine was {{able to work with}} her subjects and bring out their emotions and record their expressions on film, helping the viewer understand what she had seen in person. Her images were always empathetic with her subject." [...] In 1976, Frank took one of her most iconic photos of bathers beside a pool in Le Brusc, Provence. By her account, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> from a distance and rushed to photograph the moment, all the while changing the roll of film in her camera. She quickly closed the lens just at the right moment, when happened to be most intense.|$|E
60|$|Yes, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> me {{watching}} <b>them,</b> {{and such}} fury {{seemed to take}} hold of her that I thought my hour had come.|$|R
5000|$|Reason: Natasha {{broke it}} off because <b>she</b> never really <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> going far {{and it was}} more of a fling for her.|$|R
60|$|Dea Flavia paid no heed {{to them as}} they murmured {{words of}} {{leave-taking}} in her ear. 'Tis doubtful if <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> one of <b>them</b> or cared if they went or stayed.|$|R
2500|$|The {{next morning}} the two {{brothers}} started for home. [...] Along the trail they met , Talking God, and , Water Sprinkler. [...] "Well done, nihinálí, our grandsons," [...] they said. [...] You are worthy of all that we taught you. [...] You have served your people well." [...] And the two gods each sang a song to celebrate {{the victory of the}} twins over , the Giant. [...] These two songs are sung today whenever a victory is celebrated. [...] When the brothers came close to the home of Changing Woman, their mother, and First Man and First Woman, they hid their armor and weapons and the scalp of [...] in the bushes, and then went inside. [...] Changing Woman rejoiced when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them.</b> [...] "Where have you been?" [...] she asked. [...] "I thought a monster had devoured you." [...] "We followed , the Holy Trail," [...] said the elder son, [...] [...] "We came upon , Spider Woman, and she told us how to go to the house of , our father the Sun. [...] He gave us weapons, and with them we killed , the Big Giant." [...] "Do not say this," [...] said First Man. [...] "No one can kill [...]" [...] Then the brothers led their mother and grandparents outside and showed them the scalp of Yéʼiitsoh, and they rejoiced. [...] Together they sang and danced to celebrate the victory.|$|E
60|$|And so when Mrs. Darling {{went back}} to the night-nursery to see if her husband was asleep, all the beds were occupied. The {{children}} waited for her cry of joy, but it did not come. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> but she did not believe they were there. You see, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Fentolin {{was passing}} along the {{corridor}} as they issued from the room. She started a little as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, Gavin, {{unaware that}} {{talk about him}} and a woman unknown had broken out in Thrums, was gazing, {{sometimes}} lovingly and again with scorn, at a little bunch of holly-berries which Jean had gathered from her father's garden. Once <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> him fling <b>them</b> out of his window, and then she rejoiced. But an hour afterwards <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> him pick <b>them</b> up, and then she mourned. Nevertheless, to her great delight, he preached his third sermon against Woman on the following Sabbath. It was universally acknowledged {{to be the best}} of the series. It was also the last.|$|R
50|$|After a 70-hour ride {{without food}} or water, Eva and Miriam, {{along with their}} mother, arrived at the {{selection}} platform. Eva gripped her mother's hand and looked around: her father and her two older sisters were nowhere in sight. <b>She</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> again. Soon the twin girls were ripped from their mother, whom they also never saw again.|$|R
60|$|Then {{in each of}} {{the four}} gay squares that were at the corners of the strip that framed the star, was a white bit bearing other {{pictures}} and couplets that both pleased and abashed Patty as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> and read <b>them.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Dancing and {{laughing}} {{along the beach}} came the twenty-ninth bather, [...] The rest did not see her, but <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> and loved them.|$|E
60|$|One day Jorth rode home in {{the early}} morning, after an absence of two nights. Ellen heard the clip-clop of, horses long before <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|As they advanced, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> coming, {{and seemed}} rather troubled. But she greeted her brother {{with the usual}} warmth, and touched the {{extended}} hand of Bradley.|$|E
60|$|She {{repelled}} the kindly {{approaches of}} the Hallecks, sometimes sending {{word to the}} door when they came, that she was sick and could not see them; or when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> any of <b>them,</b> repeating those hopeless lies concerning Bartley's whereabouts, and her expectations of his return.|$|R
6000|$|Some {{eyes were}} discourteously {{turned on the}} maiden, but <b>she</b> hardly <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> and at any rate her nose was not crooked, nor had her eyes and mouth changed places, {{as in the case}} of the [...] "Loathly Lady." [...] She heard of the {{condition}} on which the lady revealed the secret, and how King Arthur bound himself to bring a fair young knight to wed the hideous being. Then when he revealed to his assembled knights - ...|$|R
50|$|Shortly afterwards, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn {{have escaped}} {{and set off}} to pursue revenge on Catwoman for leaving them behind. The two of them found Catwoman and fought her. While they were fighting, Catwoman says that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> good in <b>them</b> and only wanted to help them. Batman was about to arrest them, but Catwoman helped {{the two of them}} escape.|$|R
60|$|MRS KNOX. It wasnt true, Mr Gilbey. She used {{to pick up}} {{handkerchiefs}} if <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> lying about; but {{you might}} trust her with untold silver.|$|E
6000|$|When he {{next came}} it was, to her surprise, {{to bring her}} newspapers, now for some time discontinued. As soon as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> she said, 'I do not care for newspapers.' ...|$|E
60|$|Five {{minutes later}} Hester Earle, {{entering}} {{one of the}} rooms quietly with the vicar, found Nettie lying in a chair and apparently shivering. She looked up when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> and then turned her head away.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{afterwards}} a farmer, Mick O'Shea, is accidentally {{killed by}} his own bull. Horrified, Louise and Patrick, who witness the accident, plan to leave, but Arthur, who needs their skills (and presumably doesn't want Louise telling what <b>she</b> <b>saw),</b> convinces <b>them</b> to stay by explaining {{that he has a}} ritual that brings back the dead, but only for three days, only within the boundaries of the townland, and only if the person has been dead for less than a year. This is the ritual that Louise witnessed. The couple agree to remain, excited to see their only child again.|$|R
50|$|Shopping {{for clothes}} for Acorna on Nered the miners are rescued from their pursuers, {{who have been}} {{tracking}} their credit account, by Pal, with assistance from the shop clerk. Pal joins them on the Uhuru and releases sleep gas to render the crew unconscious after they are underway to Kezdet. Li has the mineral rights to Kezdet's moons and wants the miners to set up lunar mining operations. On arrival, Judit invites Acorna and the miners to Li's mansion. She is astonished that {{in the year since}} <b>she</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>them,</b> Acorna has grown from a child into a tall young woman.|$|R
5000|$|Gabrielle Ruiz as [...] "Valencia" [...] Maria Perez, Josh's {{controlling}} {{girlfriend and}} Rebecca's rival for Josh's affections. She initially {{had a strong}} resistance to forming relationships to women and disliked <b>them</b> as <b>she</b> originally <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> as competition for Josh's affections. Thus making her socially inept in having friendships with women. She feels very unfulfilled having devoted 15 {{years of her life}} to her relationship with Josh. Valencia is believed to suffer from insecurities over her body image. In season 2, Valencia is no longer Josh's girlfriend and is befriended by Rebecca. (recurring, season 1; main, season 2-present).|$|R
60|$|Lady Annabel {{rose from}} her seat {{and walked to the}} window; {{apparently}} her eye watched only the passing gondolas, but indeed <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> not; she saw only her child stretched perhaps on the couch of death.|$|E
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head calmly, like a person who saw things as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them.</b> [...] "You don't do me justice. I think your conduct in {{excellent}} taste and the best you could adopt. Yes, that's what I think." ...|$|E
60|$|Some of the Gargoyles saw them, presently, {{and lost}} {{no time in}} {{collecting}} a band to pursue the escaping prisoners; so that when Dorothy happened to look back <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> coming in a great cloud that almost darkened the sky.|$|E
6000|$|... "What shall I go as?" [...] was the {{universal}} cry. Garrets {{were taken by}} storm, cherished relics were teased out of old ladies' lavendered chests (happy <b>she</b> who <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> again!), hats were made into boots, gowns into doublets, cloaks into hose, Sunday bonnets despoiled of their plumage, silken cauliflowers sown broadcast over the land, and cocked-up caps erected in every style of architecture, while [...] "Tag, Rag, and Bobtail" [...] drove a smashing business, and everybody knew what everybody else was going to be, and solemnly vowed they didn't--which transparent falsehood was the best joke of the whole.|$|R
50|$|Tracing {{the history}} of people born into slavery is {{notoriously}} difficult. Although some sources point to her birth in North Carolina, other historians have traced Bickford's birth to Jonesboro, Tennessee, to a mother owned by John Blair III. Blair made a fortune in the 1849 California Gold Rush and was active in politics, serving as both a state senator and a U.S. Congressman. In 1860, he owned a hotel in Knoxville, where Sarah (also known as Sallie) likely worked. Blair died in 1863; settling his estate is likely the reason that Sarah was separated from her family. Bickford told people that her parents were sold during the Civil War and that <b>she</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>them</b> again.|$|R
5000|$|The heiress of the Umenomori {{family and}} one of the main heroines. Though her family is wealthy, she is {{isolated}} by its prominence and her parents' absence. Her parents are normally busy at work and almost never around (it has been over a year since <b>she</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>them),</b> so <b>she</b> lives through every single day without feeling the warmth of a family. Thus, Chise is spiritually and emotionally orphaned, yet another [...] "stray cat" [...] in need of a home. She is a typical spoiled rich girl who uses her great wealth and authority to get whatever she wants, and is the chief instigator of the sports festival competition between the spats and bloomers factions in volume 2.|$|R
