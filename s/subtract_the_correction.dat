We find that, overall, the best agreement with experiment, comparable to that of the high-level CASPT 2, is obtained with B 3 LYP/AE, closely followed by Becke 98 /AE and Becke 98 /ECP. FSLYP/AE and B 3 LYP/ECP give slightly worse agreement with experiment, and FSLYP/ECP is the only method among the ones we studied that gives an unaceptably large error, underestimating the dissociation energy of nickel dimer by 28 %, and being in the largest disagreement with the experiment and the other theoretical predictions.

The new parameters reproduce also the radii of these nuclei with an accuracy comparable with that obtained with the NL 1 and NL 3 sets. 1. RMFT parameters The Relativistic Mean Field Theory (RMFT) 1, which is essentialy a Hartree-Fock like method based on the Dirac equation for nucleons and the Klein-Gordon equation for the: ρ, ω, σ mesons and photons, reproduces well the nuclear properties when its parameters (i. e. : masses of nucleons: m, mesons: mρ, mω, mσ and their coupling constants ρρ, ρω, ρσ, ρ 2, ρ 3) are fitted to the largest possible amount of nuclear data. Usually the masses and mean square radii of 8 magic nuclei were used to find the RMFT parameters and several sets were established for various regions and quantities as: masses, barriers or radii.
