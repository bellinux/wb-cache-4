50|$|Aluminum rims {{are often}} {{reinforced}} with either single eyelets or double eyelets {{to distribute the}} stress of the spoke. A <b>single</b> <b>eyelet</b> reinforces the spoke hole much like a hollow rivet. A double eyelet is a cup that is riveted into both walls of a double-walled rim.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the visual and}} refractive outcomes after phacoemulsification surgery in eyes with isolated lens coloboma. Design: Prospective, consecutive case series. Participants: Eighteen eyes with isolated lens coloboma of 13 patients {{were included in the}} study. Mean patient age was 13. 9 ± 6. 5 years. Methods: Patients underwent phacoemulsification surgery, with combined implantation of capsular tension ring (CTR) and intraocular lens. In colobomas of less than 120 °, a CTR was used, whereas in colobomas of more than 120 °, a Cionni-modified <b>single</b> <b>eyelet</b> CTR was used to achieve better capsular centration. The main outcome measures were uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, refraction, and keratometry. Results: Mean logMAR uncorrected distance visual acuity and corrected distance visual acuity improved significantly from 1. 53 ± 0. 35 and 1. 02 ± 0. 47 before surgery to 0. 67 ± 0. 51 and 0. 52 ± 0. 49 at the last visit of the follow-up (p < 0. 001). Mean refractive cylinder and spherical equivalent decreased significantly from – 6. 73 ± 1. 73 and – 6. 72 ± 4. 07 D preoperatively to – 1. 40 ± 1. 39 and – 0. 83 ± 1. 31 D {{at the end of the}} follow-up (p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 01, respectively). Mean keratometric astigmatism at preoperative and postoperative visits were 1. 58 ± 0. 97 and 1. 65 ± 0. 94 D, respectively (p = 0. 70). Conclusions: Phacoemulsification with CTR and intraocular lens implantation is an effective and safe option for providing a refractive correction and a significant visual improvement in eyes with isolated lens coloboma...|$|E
50|$|Hipparchia fagi has a {{wingspan}} of 66 - 76 mm. These large butterflies have {{dark brown}} uppersides of the wings, with a fringed margin, a white submarginal band more {{evident in the}} females and one black eyelet {{at the apex of}} each forewings. In the males the white band has a <b>single</b> very small <b>eyelet</b> on each hindwing, sometimes showing a white pupil, while in the females it shows one or two ocelli.|$|R
