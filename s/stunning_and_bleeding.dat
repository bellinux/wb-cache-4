It is therefore necessary that it reaches the consumer in the best hygienic and sanitary conditions. Human health depends, to a great extent, on the quality and healthiness of the food, as these can constitute a potential sanitary risk. Regarding meat, it is the slaughterhouse which is greatly responsible for its quality. The aim of this work is to study the effects in the slaughter line, reducing the time between the <b>stunning</b> <b>and</b> the <b>bleeding,</b> increasing the time between the next tasks and consequently improving the working conditions of the operators and the hygiene throughout the process, noticing a decrease in the spoilage of the carcass, which has a reflection in the results of the management indicators analysed. This optimization was tested by the evaluation of the control of the productive process, good practices of production, the process of hygiene and organization of the cutting utensils, the level control of the carcass hygiene and the bacteriologic profile of the surfaces and cutting utensils. In this study, the microbiologic results relating to the carcass and the cutting utensils before and after optimization of the slaughtering line, reflected a decrease in values not only in aerobic mesophilic micro-organisms 30 ÂºC, but also in Enterobacteriaceae and Salmonella. This improvement at a microbiological level is a great indicator of the efficiency of the hygiene process along the productive process and the improvements undergone in the slaughtering technology, resulting in high quality meat...|$|R
40|$|The Council Regulation (EC) No. 1099 / 2009 {{requires}} slaughterhouse {{managers to}} implement specific {{standard operating procedures}} for all pre-slaughter stages considered at risk, aimed at achieving adequate levels of animal welfare. This survey was aimed at testing the applicability to an abattoir for heavy pigs of an assessment system of animal welfare through animal-based measures. In the monitoring of handling operations, the number of animals fallen/slipped and prodded, and that of vocalising pigs were recorded. In the monitoring of the immobilisation stage, carried out on the same pigs, vocalisations were recorded {{at the entrance to}} the box and falls/slips occurring inside it. Animal welfare assessment during the stunning-sticking-bleeding steps, was carried out by recording the head-only electrical stunning basic parameters set by legislation, vocalisations resulting from hot wanding, and clinical signs of consciousness, sensibility and certain death. Except for immobilisation, the percentage of occurrence of these events above acceptability limits was detected in all other preslaughter steps. The most critical stages were: handling in the unloading area and along the single-file chute, <b>stunning</b> <b>and</b> especially <b>bleeding,</b> where 84. 13 % of animals showed one or more signs of consciousness and/or sensibility recovery.

40|$|The {{slaughtering}} procedures at agritourism farms must {{be carried}} out in accordance with the general and hygiene requirements of Regulations (EC) No 852 and 853 / 2004. In addition, regional laws define minimum requirements allowing some flexibility. Piglets and finishing pigs are the most frequently slaughtered animal in Sardinian agritourism farms. The aim of the present survey was to evaluate: the general and hygiene requirements of outbuilding slaughterhouses in agritourisms; the animal welfare indicators; the microbial contamination of piglets and finishing pigs carcasses. Six agritourisms outbuilding slaughterhouses â EU-approved â were investigated. General and hygiene requirements of outbuilding slaughterhouses and animal welfare indicators of 68 piglets and 5 finishing pigs were evaluated by mean of a checklist. The following parameters were determined on 45 piglets and 5 finishing pigs carcasses: i) pH 1 and 24 h after slaughter, and ii) carcass surface microbial contamination by non destructive method (sponge) on the following sampling sites: ham; back (adults); belly; jowl (adults). Aerobic colony count (ACC; ISO 4833 : 2003), Enterobacteriaceae (EB; ISO 21528 - 2 : 2004), Salmonella spp. (ISO 6579 : 2002), Listeria monocytogenes (ISO 11290 - 1 : 1996 and 11290 - 2 : 1998) were also tested. All the plants except one have two separate rooms, for clean and dirty zones, <b>stunning</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleeding</b> operations being frequently carried out on open air. The piglet scalding was carried out in hot water bowls, and hair removal by singeing. Animal welfare signs revealed the following aspects: handling: hoisting prior to stunning, vocalizations (41 %); stunning: not individual access to box, repeated shocks (4 %), mean voltage 135. 6 V, mean current for head-only electrical stunning 0. 78 A; indicators of not effective stunning: palpebral reflex (24. 2 %), corneal reflex (12. 8 %), vocalizations (15. 4 %); bleeding: conscious and sensitive animal shackling (53. 8 %). Results of carcass evaluation showed, for piglets and adult pig respectively: i) pH: pH 1 = 6. 21 Â± 0. 25 and 6. 18 Â± 0. 22; pH 24 = 5. 66 Â± 0. 17 and 5. 49 Â± 0. 11; ii) ACC: 4. 11 Â± 0. 64 and 4. 63 Â± 0. 42 (log 10 CFU/cm 2, meanÂ±standard deviation); iii) Enterobacteriaceae prevalence of 81. 6 % (2. 55 Â± 0. 80) in piglets and 100 % (3. 22 Â± 0. 90) in adults. Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes were not detected in any of the samples.

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{determine}} whether feather retention force (FRF) in 6 -wk-old commercial broilers was in-fluenced {{by the presence}} or absence of cutaneous innervation, nerve trunks for the pectoral and sternal feather tracts were severed unilaterally (left side) in Trial 1. In Trial 2, the sternal subcutaneous nerve trunk was severed either unilaterally (left or right side) or bilater-ally. Four days postdenervation, FRF was determined bilaterally either antemortem (immediately prior to stunning) or 2 min after <b>stunning</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleeding</b> (post-mortem). In Trial 1, the pectoral feather tract ante- and postmortem FRF values did not differ significantly for innervated or denervated tracts. In this trial, the sternal feather tract ante- and postmortem FRF values were 13 % higher (44 g) for the denervated (left side) than for the innervated (right side) treatments. Partitioning this difference into the effects of sample side or innervation could not be attained because only the left side was denervated (left-denervation or right-innervated) in Trial 1. In Trial 2, both the left and right sternal feather tracts were represented in equal numbers for the innervated and denervated treatments, and there were no significant differences in FRF related to innervation, left and right side, or ante- and postmortem sample times. The presence or absence of cutaneous nerve innervation does not appear to influence FRF ante- or postmortem. This finding indicates that treatments disabling the central nervous system antemortem may lower FRF indirectly by altering cutaneous metabolism and therefore have been consistently unsuccessful in substantially altering postmortem FRF...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate efficiency of the stunning process in two slaughterhouses as an indicator of animal welfare. Stunning was evaluated in 1343 bovines. Signs of loss of consciousness (corneal reflex, attempts to head up, vocalizations and rhythmic breathing) as well as behavioral indicators of Animal Welfare (AW) loss (slipping, falling, vocalizations, jumping and backward movements) were assessed to identify animal welfare standards. Besides, the stunning delay, the number of shots per animal, the appropriate location of the shots and the interval between shot and bleeding were measured. Although, 98. 5 % of animals collapsed immediately after receiving the first shot, 23. 6 % (n= 307) recovered sensitivity before bleeding, because of the wide interval between <b>stunning</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleeding</b> which was higher than 60 seconds (98. 7 %). There was a significant association between stunning delay and the number of behavioral events counted (p< 0. 01). Moreover, differences in the behavioral indicators among the slaughterhouses evaluated were found (p< 0. 01) showing greater incidence in slaughter house âAâ which had a head fixation system, but not one to hold still the entire body of the animal. Aversive behavioral responses were encountered in plant âBâ, such as the use of cattle prods to hold and push the animal while it was in the stunning box.

40|$|The {{slaughter}} {{process in}} its current form is responsible to numerous physiological impacts on the animal and as a consequence affects the quality of the meat which is produced. The kosher slaughter is performed by a Rabbi (a certified Jewish religious priest) employed by the meat processing facility. The aim was to compare different types of slaughter methods and restraining techniques {{in order to determine the}} positive and negative sides of each method and to assess the hygienic quality of the meat produced from this method of slaughter. The information regarding kosher slaughter was gathered from one slaughterhouse located in Israel, Haifa city, and specific aspects related to the conventional slaughter technology, was acquired from a slaughterhouse located in Maramures County, where we critically observed the cattle slaughter technology, with focus on <b>stunning</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleeding</b> steps. In order to compare the hygienic quality of kosher beef with conventional beef the research material consisted by 40 samples of beef, half of the samples were represented by kosher beef and the other half (conventional beef) were used as control. Total viable and Enterobacteriaceae count were performed from the collected samples according with standards methods. In case of conventional slaughter, with respecting of good hygienic practices (GHP), bleeding will not open the esophagus and trachea, preventing thus the possibility of contamination. Stunning performed in conventional slaughter could increase the risk of contamination of carcasses with prions in case of penetration of the skull. In case of kosher meat, the results regarding total plate count revealed values between 2. 78 Â± 0. 6 log cfu/cm 2 and 3. 40 Â± 0. 2 log cfu/cm 2. In case ofÂ  Enterobacteriaceae germs, we noticed that 3 samples shown a negative results. For the rest of the samples, the microbial load ranged between 2. 54 Â± 0. 62 log fcu/cm 2 and 3. 1 Â± 0. 32 log fcu/cm 2. In comparison, the conventional meat (control), present an elevated total microbial load, ranged between 4. 77 Â± 0. 56 log cfu/cm 2 and 5. 34 Â± 0. 21 log cfu/cm 2. The Enterobacteriacee load ranged between 4. 1 Â± 0. 56 log cfu/cm 2 and 5. 33 Â± 0. 2 log cfu/cm 2. Ritual kosher slaughter is a humane way of sacrificing animals for human consumption although there are many parameters which need to be carefully monitored in order to guarantee the welfare of the slaughtered animals. And thus, inherently this method is prone for animal welfare violation.

40|$|Atlantic cod is a {{promising}} species for fish farming in Norway. In {{order to maintain}} a high fish quality and achieve higher fish quality, it is necessary toincrease the understanding of pre and post mortem biochemical processes in fish. The effects of pre slaughter handling stress on fish quality have been observed in many studies. Stress and storage temperature had effect on the color and texture of pre rigor filleted farmed cod. The main objectives {{of this study were}} to determine effects of handling stress and storage conditions on cod quality by a number of defined quality criteria, and determine activities of selected proteolytic enzymesthat are important for the quality properties. In the first experiment, done in 2008, cod were subjected to crowding stress by restricting the available water volume in combination with forced movement of the fish with continuous sea water supply for 1. 5 hour. In experiment 2, done in 2009, making noise âsound effectsâ {{on the cover of the}} reservoir and increasing handling of the fish were applied with the aim of subjecting the fish to a more stressful event than the first experiment. Fish were slaughtered by <b>stunning</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleeding,</b> and then gutted and filleted. Both the control fish and the stressed fishfillets were stored in ice and in a cold room (+ 5 CÂº) for 4 and 8 days in the first experiment. In the experiment 2, fillets were stored in ice for 5 days. Samples collection were done on the day of slaughter for protease activities analysis, stress parameters (plasma cortisol, lactate and glucose), muscle pH while on the day of storage, muscle pH was measured, sampling for quality parameters (water holdingcapacity, solubility properties of proteins) and proteases activities analysis were collected. Results showed that handling stress was confirmed by increase in plasma cortisol, lactate and glucose levels in blood, measured on the day of slaughter. Muscle pH measured on the day of slaughter was significantly higher in the stress fish than in the control fish and muscle pH declined during storage. In experiment 2, increased level of handling stress led to significantly higher WHC in the control fish than in the stress fish. Handling stress and time of storage had significantly negative effecton water-soluble proteins while the interaction of all factors had a negative significant effect on salt soluble proteins and extractable proteins. Handling stress and storage conditions did not have significant effects on general protease activity and amount of TCA soluble peptides. The amount of muscular water-soluble proteins in the enzyme extracts in the initial samples was significantly higher than amount of muscular water-soluble proteins in the enzyme extracts after storage. During storage, activity of cathepsin B- and B+L-like enzymes were relatively stable. Activity of collagenase-like enzymes was significantly reduced during storage while activity of cathepsin D/E varied during storage. Significant correlations between muscle pH, amount of muscular water-soluble proteins and specific proteases activities were found. No significant correlations between quality parameters (WHC, solubility properties of proteins, water content) and specific proteases activities were found, except for significant positive correlations between salt soluble, extractable proteins and activity of cathepsin D/E-like enzymes calculated per g wet weight. Results from sensory analysis in experiment 2 showed that there were significant differences in yellow color and hardness 1 between the control fish and the stressed fish fillets, and no significant differences were found in the other investigated parameters. The significant correlations among specific proteases activities indicated the contribution of specific proteases activities to muscle degradation during postmortem storage. The coming results on proteomic may explain if handling stress really affect on the muscle degradation and/or which types of proteins will be degraded. </p...|$|E
