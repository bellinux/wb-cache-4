40|$|Abstract. Wireless Sensor Networks provide {{unprecedented}} {{possibilities for}} monitoring and {{interacting with the}} real-world. Unfortunately, the lack of open and simple standards for ad-hoc collaboration between heterogeneous embedded devices {{makes it difficult to}} build large-scale deployments. For every particular application requires complex integration work, and therefore technical expertise, effort and time. Following the success of Web 2. 0 mashups, we propose to reuse the founding principles of the modern Web architecture as a lightweight middleware. Using Web standards to network all kinds of devices will encourages widespread adoption by maximizing reuse of <b>shared</b> <b>devices</b> and lowering the access barrier for people to use and develop applications on a much wider ecosystem of <b>shared</b> <b>devices.</b> With our approach we push the World Wide Web towards sensor networks so that interacting with devices becomes as easy as typing a URI in a Web browser. 1 Problem statemen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Prevalent {{and popular}} {{virtualization}} technologies {{have concentrated on}} consolidating servers based on the CPU component of the workload. Other system resources, particularly I/O devices like network interfaces and disks have been always designed {{to be in control}} of the OS that is managing system resources. <b>Sharing</b> of these <b>devices</b> has been through the OS abstraction layers, with device always being accessed and managed by the privileged OS kernel. Extending such systems for virtualization has resulted in <b>sharing</b> the <b>device</b> access path along-with the <b>shared</b> <b>device,</b> which makes this software layer the vulnerable component for the whole system. In this paper we argue that virtualization gives a simple and efficient mechanism for isolation, and hence improved security, if architected correctly. We analyze the existing I/O virtualization architectures with a view towards identifying the security issues and propose an enhancement that addresses these issues...|$|R

In this setting, the subsidy acts as a certification device within firms in which managers are biased against R&D activities and will trigger an increase in private R&D investment driven by internal funding. The subsidy will have no informational content for managers well aware about the quality of their R&D.

To use such devices more efficiently {{and improve their}} usability, peo-ple want to <b>share</b> surrounding peripheral <b>devices</b> between computers without any modification of their own comput-ing environments. The recent <b>device</b> <b>sharing</b> technologies in the pervasive computing area are not sufficient for the peripheral devices of personal computers because these technologies do not provide the network-transparency for applications and device drivers. In this paper, we propose USB/IP as a transparent <b>device</b> <b>sharing</b> mechanism over IP network.

40|$|Taking part in {{the renewed}} focus {{on the concept of}} risk in {{analysing}} the dynamics of social organisations, we develop a representation of the employment relationship as a risk <b>sharing</b> <b>device.</b> Our thesis is that the dynamics of employment systems can be best understood as changing forms and levels of risks assumed by workers and employers. First, referring to economic and legal studies, we specify the risks at stake in the employment relationship and their repartition. Two types of risk are defined: one regarding the internal organisation of the firm, the other the selling of goods. We then study the employment contract as a risk sharing tool between employers and workers. Second, we apply this analytical scheme to the interpretation of the transformations in French employment relationships over a period of two centuries. Such historical perspective relies on the analysis of changes in the legal framework as well as in individual practices...|$|E
40|$|Thanks {{to their}} power, the many sensors they embed, and their {{inherent}} connectivity to Internet, smartphones are certainly becoming {{the primary source}} of multimedia content and the main tool for content sharing. In this demo, we analyze the complexity of real-time video streaming among smartphone users. Firstly, we show that the traditional solution-a unique server receiving and dispatching all devices' content-suffers from scalability issues. Then, we present StreamSmart, a distributed system for real-time video streaming of smartphones, that leverages a virtual P 2 P network of smartphone software clones on the cloud. In StreamSmart, the captured content is forwarded from the <b>sharing</b> <b>device</b> to its own cloud clone, that in turn forwards it to the clones of other users. These latter transmit the content to the respective devices and, at the same time, contribute to further spread it to other possible clones in the network.

30|$|Weight {{bearing in}} an Ilizarov frame leads to load {{transfer}} and consequent deflection {{of the frame}} itself. This laxity is primarily due to wire deflection, since connecting rod and ring deformation {{has been shown to}} be minimal at physiological loads [18]. As the frame will act as a load <b>sharing</b> <b>device</b> with the patients’ tissues, it would seem likely that as the fracture unites, increasing fracture site rigidity will reduce movement and load transfer to the wires and therefore subsequent wire deformation [19]. If this wire deflection can be measured reliably, this variable may therefore offer a surrogate marker of bony consolidation. Whilst wire deflection has been measured using computational methods such as edge detection [20], there is, to our knowledge, no described method of wire deflection measurement that is clinically appropriate. The aim of this study was to assess the repeatability of our method for assessing wire deflection in a laboratory setting and to determine if this method could differentiate between an unstable and an intact bone reliably.|$|E

40|$|Global {{financial}} integration unlocks a huge potential for international risk sharing. We examine {{the degree to}} which international equity holdings act as a risk <b>sharing</b> <b>device</b> in industrial and emerging economies. We split equity returns into investment income (dividend distribution) and capital gains to investigate which of the two channels delivers the largest potential for risk sharing. Our evidence suggests that net capital gains are a more potent channel of risk sharing. They behave in a countercyclical way, that is they tend to be positive (negative) when the domestic economy is growing more slowly (rapidly) {{than the rest of the}} world. Countries with more countercyclical net capital gains experience improved consumption risk sharing. The empirical analysis furthermore suggests that these risk sharing properties of net capital gains have increased through time, in particular in the 1990 s and early- 2000 s, on the back of a declining equity home bias and financial market deepening.

40|$|The Soviet {{repression}} of the Hungarian uprising in 1956 caused an exodus of 200, 000 refugees. Most of the refugees fled to Austria.

40|$|Split torque {{transmissions}} {{are attractive}} alternatives to conventional planetary designs for helicopter transmissions. The split torque designs can offer lighter weight and fewer parts {{but have not}} been used extensively for lack of experience, especially with obtaining proper load sharing. Two split torque designs that use different load sharing methods have been studied. Precise indexing and alignment of the geartrain to produce acceptable load sharing has been demonstrated. An elastomeric torque splitter that has large torsional compliance and damping produces even better load sharing while reducing dynamic transmission error and noise. However, the elastomeric torque splitter as now configured is not capable over {{the full range of}} operating conditions of a fielded system. A thrust balancing load <b>sharing</b> <b>device</b> was evaluated. Friction forces that oppose the motion of the balance mechanism are significant.
