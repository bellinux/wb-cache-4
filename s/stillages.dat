The mashing was performed with recirculation of: 0, 10, 20 and 30 % of the thin <b>stillage.</b> The thin <b>stillage</b> recirculation was repeated six times. In the experiment without the thin <b>stillage,</b> the recirculation bioethanol yield (compared to the theoretical yield) was 97. 96 %, which implicates that the experiment conditions were chosen and performed well. With {{the addition of}} the thin <b>stillage,</b> the bioethanol yield increased and was above 100 %. Higher bioethanol yield than 100 % {{can be explained by the}} fact that the thin <b>stillage</b> contains carbohydrates, amino acids and yeast cells degradation products. The bioethanol yield increased with the increased number of thin <b>stillage</b> recirculation cycles. Dry matter content in fermenting slurry increased with the increased thin <b>stillage</b> quantity and the number of the thin <b>stillage</b> recirculation cycles (8. 04 % for the first and 9. 40 % for the sixth cycle). Dry matter content in thin <b>stillage</b> increased with the increased thin <b>stillage</b> quantity and the number of thin <b>stillage</b> recirculation cycles.

50|$|Cask beer is the {{traditional}} method of service, via a hand pump or by gravity straight from the cask on stillage. Cask conditioned beer is unfiltered, unpasteurized and lacking artificial carbonation (the bubbles are produced by the ongoing fermentation), giving it a limited shelf-life. This dispense method is strongly associated with ale, {{although there is no}} technical barrier to serving lager or stout this way. Most pubs use hand pumps ("beer engines") to draw the beer, whereas <b>stillages</b> are commonly employed at beer festivals. Cask ale and bottle conditioned beer are championed by the Campaign for Real Ale under the name real ale. Prior to stainless steel casks, beer was delivered in large wooden barrels, which were delivered to the cellar via a trap-door on the footpath using two ropes wound about the barrels midriff (a parbuckle) to lower the barrel gently down the cellar's ramp. They then had to stand on their sides for a few days so the sediment would settle {{to the bottom of the}} belly of the barrel, after which they would be 'tapped' by punching the pre-cut centre of the (traditionally cork) bung (at the lower edge of the barrel end) into the barrel by hitting the tapered brass 'tap' with a mallet. One could then attach the pipe connector onto the tap, so that the cellarman could turn the tap on when ready. In a similar manner, one would punch through the centre of a bung on the upper side of the barrel's belly with a hardwood spile (tapered peg). The hardwood spile prevents air access. Once the barrel is in use, the spile is replaced with a 'soft' spile, traditionally made from softwood, but nowadays from bonded-together (woody) fibres. The soft spile prevents a vacuum forming at the upper surface of the beer: it allows sufficient air in for the beer engine to work, but keeps dust, flies and other mischief-makers out.|$|E

Determination of soil pH, AI, Ca, Mg, K, Na, and P and analyses of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg in the + 3 leaf, 3 - 6 sheaths, and 8 - 10 internodes were made throughout the crop. At harvest, yield of primary stalks and tillers were recorded, juice analyzed for Pol, brix, reducing sugars, fiber and ash, and total nutrient uptake determined. Yields of cane and sugar increased up to 120 Kg K/ha from both <b>stillage</b> and KCl broadcast applications. At this K rate, soil K concentration at 15 days after application was 0. 22 meq/ 100 g and + 3 leaf, 3 - 6 sheath, and 8 - 10 internode K concentrations were 1. 99 and 1. 51, respectively, at 4 months and 0. 98, 2. 43, and 0. 75, respectively, at 10 months of age. Since these soil and tissue K levels were associated with the highest statistical yields from K broadcast, it may be concluded that they are adequate for sugarcane growth. It was necessary to add approximately 100 m 3 of <b>stillage</b> to supply 120 Kg of K. Rates of K from <b>stillage</b> up to 480 kg/ha appear to have no detrimental effects on cane and sugar yields. However, 960 and 1920 Kg K/ha from <b>stillage</b> increased cane, but decreased sugar yields and juice quality. These negative effects of high <b>stillage</b> rates on sugar yields seem {{to be related to the}} N added with <b>stillage.</b> Addition of dolomite with high <b>stillage</b> rates raised soil pH and increased <b>stillage</b> N mineralization resulting in lower plant N and higher juice quality. Ripener (Polaris) application 10 weeks prior to harvest also lowered plant N and improved juice quality. <b>Stillage</b> applied in the furrow immediately after planting at 240 Kg K/ha resulted in the highest yields. This was probably due to the increased germination, emergence and early growth rates observed in these treatments. Soil pH, Ca, Mg, and especially K increased with <b>stillage</b> application while soil Al decreased, particularly at high <b>stillage</b> rates. Application of high <b>stillage</b> rates may induce Ca and Mg deficiencies because more K is added relative to Ca and Mg which leads to a high K/Ca + Mg ratio. Application of dolomite improved this ratio resulting in higher yields. Leaching of soil K increased with increasing <b>stillage</b> application rates. Concentrations of Ca and Mg decreased whereas K increased in plant tissues with increasing K rates. Therefore, if high <b>stillage</b> rates are to be applied, soil Ca and Mg levels should be determined to predict possible deficiencies. The 3 - 6 sheaths and 8 - 10 internodes appeared to be the most sensitive to plant K, Ca, and Mg status. All three tissues were adequate for plant N. A sugarcane yield response curve to K fertilization may be used to determine the amount of <b>stillage</b> K to be applied. In addition, since <b>stillage</b> N and K composition are highly variable, these should be determined to quantify the amounts of these nutrients supplied by <b>stillage.</b> If high amounts of <b>stillage</b> are to be applied for waste management, problems such as difficulty in cane ripening, lower juice quality and soil salinization should be considered.

The methane production rate was 0. 2  L/g COD, with a methane percentage of 60 and 64, and 92 and 94  % soluble COD removed, respectively, by the mesophilic and thermophilic reactors. Although both treatment processes were equally efficient, there were different microbial communities involved possibly arising from the differences in the composition of energy cane and sugar cane stillage. There was more acetic acid in sugar cane stillage which may have promoted the occurrence of aceticlastic methanogens to perform a direct conversion of acetate to methane in reactors treating sugar cane stillage. Conclusions Results showed that thin stillage contains easily degradable compounds suitable for anaerobic digestion and that hybrid reactors can efficiently convert thin stillage to methane under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. Furthermore, we found that optimal conditions for biological treatment of thin stillage were similar for both mesophilic and thermophilic reactors.

40|$|Lignocellulosic {{biomass is a}} {{renewable}} resource that can be utilized {{for the production of}} biofuels, chemicals, and bio-based materials. Biochemical conversion of lignocellulose to advanced biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol, is generally performed through microbial fermentation of sugars generated by thermochemical pretreatment of the biomass followed by an enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulose. The aims of the research presented in this thesis were to address problems associated with pretreatment by-products that inhibit microbial and enzymatic biocatalysts, and to investigate the potential of utilizing residual streams from pulp mills and biorefineries to produce hydrolytic enzymes. A novel method to detoxify lignocellulosic hydrolysates to improve the fermentability was investigated in experiments with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The method is based on treatment of lignocellulosic slurries and hydrolysates with reducing agents, such as sodium dithionite and sodium sulfite. The effects of treatment with sodium borohydride were also investigated. Treatment of a hydrolysate of Norway spruce by addition of 10 mM dithionite resulted in an increase of the balanced ethanol yield from 0. 03 to 0. 35 g/g. Similarly, the balanced ethanol yield of a hydrolysate of sugarcane bagasse increased from 0. 06 to 0. 28 g/g after treatment with 10 mM dithionite. In another study with a hydrolysate of Norway spruce, addition of 34 mM borohydride increased the balanced ethanol yield from 0. 02 to 0. 30 g/g, while the ethanol productivity increased from 0. 05 to 0. 57 g/(L×h). While treatment with sulfur oxyanions had a positive effect on microbial fermentation and enzymatic hydrolysis, treatment with borohydride resulted in an improvement only for the microbial fermentation. The chemical effects of treatments of hydrolysates with sodium dithionite, sodium sulfite, and sodium borohydride were investigated using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Treatments with dithionite and sulfite were found to rapidly sulfonate inhibitors already at room temperature and at a pH that is compatible with enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial fermentation. Treatment with borohydride reduced inhibitory compounds, but the products were less hydrophilic than the products obtained in the reactions with the sulfur oxyanions. The potential of on-site enzyme production using low-value residual streams, such as stillage, was investigated utilizing recombinant Aspergillus niger producing xylanase and cellulase. A xylanase activity of 8, 400 nkat/ml and a cellulase activity of 2, 700 nkat/ml were reached using <b>stillages</b> from processes based on waste fiber sludge. The fungus consumed {{a large part of the}} xylose, the acetic acid, and the oligosaccharides that were left in the <b>stillages</b> after fermentation with S. cerevisiae. In another study, the capability of two filamentous fungi (A. niger and Trichoderma reesei) and three yeasts (S. cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, and Yarrowia lipolytica) to grow on inhibitory lignocellulosic media were compared. The results indicate that the two filamentous fungi had the best capability to utilize different nutrients in the media, while the S. cerevisiae strain exhibited the best tolerance against the inhibitors. Utilization of different nutrients would be especially important in enzyme production using residual streams, while tolerance against inhibitors is desirable in a consolidated bio-process in which the fermenting microorganism also contributes by producing enzymes...|$|E

Other disposal techniques mentioned in the literature (electrofenton reaction, electrocoagulation and reverse osmosis) have not been considered, due to their high costs and technological requirements. Energy and economic calculations were carried out for a planned production of 120 m 3 of stillage per day in a given distillery. Only specific treatment operating costs (per 1 m 3 of stillage) were compared, including operational costs for energy, transport and chemicals. These values were determined for January 31 st, 2009.

40|$|Wider {{exploration}} of ethanol coproduct uses is necessary as the ethanol industry continues to face challenges. Currently, process streams such as thin <b>stillage</b> and condensed distillers solubles (CDS) are processed into {{distillers dried grains}} with solubles and used as animal feeds, but other higher value opportunities may exist. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify chemical components and quantify physical properties of CDS and thin <b>stillage.</b> Protein, organic acid, and sugar profiles were determined. Zein protein was identified, and glycerol was determined to have a concentration of 18. 8 g/L in thin <b>stillage</b> and 63. 2 g/L in CDS. Physical properties including density, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and rheological behaviors were also examined. Thermal conductivity of thin <b>stillage</b> and CDS was approximately 0. 54 and 0. 45 W/m°C, respectively. Quantification of the physical properties and identification of the chemical constituents pave the way for {{exploration of}} new value-added uses for thin <b>stillage</b> and CDS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStillage, {{a liquid}} waste {{remaining}} after ethanol distillation, was collected and characterized. The liquid <b>stillage</b> contained reducing sugars (fructose and glucose) and {{volatile fatty acids}} including acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid. 1. 48 g/L of reducing sugar was found in raw <b>stillage.</b> Therefore, the <b>stillage</b> {{was able to be}} utilized as a substrate for ethanol production. The production of ethanol from <b>stillage</b> was done using different glucose concentrations [10, 20, 40 and control (raw material, no glucose addition) ] and different microorganisms including Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Enterobacter aerogenes. In addition, the mix-culture of S. cerevisiae and E. aerogenes for ethanol production was also evaluated. The process was done under batch fermentation at 35 oC, 100 rpm for 96 h. The results showed that mix-culture between S. cerevisiae and E. aerogenes yield the highest ethanol (1. 762 g ethanol/ g sugar) after 72 h of cultivation using the raw <b>stillage</b> (non-glucose addition) as a substrate...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of subsurface drip irrigation {{and the application of}} <b>stillage</b> and nutrients in some agronomic parameters, stem yield, technological characteristics of sugarcane and yield of theoretical recoverable sugar. The experiment was carried out in completely randomized block design with four treatments and five replications. The treatments were: mineral fertilizers without irrigation; irrigation and fertigation with NPK using mineral fertilizers; irrigation and fertigation with <b>stillage</b> supplying the K and complementation of N and P with mineral fertilizers; and irrigation and fertigation with <b>stillage</b> supplying the NK and complementation of P with mineral fertilizer. The system of irrigation adopted was the subsurface drip irrigation. The irrigated treatments showed higher number of tillers and leaf área index, when compared to rainfed cultivation. The fertigation with <b>stillage</b> supplying the K promoted higher Brix and stem yield when compared to non-irrigated cultivation. The irrigation and fertigation with <b>stillage</b> supplying the NK promoted higher yield of theoretical recoverable sugar, when compared the cultivation without irrigation...|$|R

This product {{has the potential to be}} used as a novel feed ingredient for poultry, swine, or cattle diets. [Beta]-carotenes have been supplemented in animal diets to improve animal health, enhance meat color and quality and increase vitamin A concentrations in milk and meat. Microbial fermentations involving growth and product kinetics were performed in 500 mL baffled shake flasks and in a 5 L fermentation bioreactor. Media optimization was conducted in shake flasks to evaluate two carbon sources: glucose and glycerol, and two nitrogen sources: ammonium sulfate and urea. Final [beta]-carotene concentration of 272. 57 ± 4. 34 [mu]g [beta]-carotene/g biomass was found to be highest for the whole <b>stillage,</b> with 10 g/L added glucose and 10 g/L nitrogen added through ammonium sulfate supplementation. Glycerol addition yielded no significant increase (P<. 05) in [beta]-carotene yield, while urea addition significantly decreased (P<. 05) the final [beta]-carotene concentrations. The resulting fermented product can be blended with regular feed using either whole <b>stillage</b> as a dry feed ingredient or thin <b>stillage</b> as a liquid feed additive. The fermentation of whole <b>stillage</b> significantly influenced the physical and flow properties of the material. Even though there was a significant decrease (P< 0. 05) in bulk density and increase (P< 0. 05) in tapped density between DDGS and fermented whole <b>stillage,</b> there was a less pronounced difference between the whole <b>stillage</b> and fermented whole <b>stillage.</b> The fermentation of whole <b>stillage</b> significantly influenced the physical and flow properties of the material. This showed that the fermentation process and resulting nutritional profile had a significant effect on the resulting fermented whole <b>stillage.</b> A 50 L bioreactor was specifically designed to evaluate the scalability of the process and to perform subsequent feed production trails. Pilot scale feed pelleting runs were conducted and the resultant product was put in environmental chambers to determine if [beta]-carotene concentration was reduced as a result of storage. There was a significant decrease (P< 0. 05) in [beta]-carotene levels after pelleting and after 28 d of storage at elevated temperature and humidity. These decreases were consistent with previous research...|$|R

40|$|Oilseeds may be {{processed}} {{to yield a}} number of potentially valuable compounds and fractions including oil, protein and small molecules. However, energy costs associated with industrial processing of oilseeds can be significant. For example, processes that use water to dissolve and separate materials are burdened with {{the costs associated with}} concentrating value-added products from dilute solutions. The ethanol industry produces large amounts of an aqueous solution called thin <b>stillage</b> that has little value and is used in animal feed. Thin <b>stillage</b> contains some of the necessary salts used in protein extraction but has a low pH. Protein extraction and protein isolate production is commonly conducted at higher pH. Waste alkali from biodiesel production has a high pH and can be used to adjust the pH of thin <b>stillage</b> to improve its ability to extract protein from oilseed meal. By combining the properties of the waste products of both the ethanol and the biodiesel industries, a complementary process is possible that may have greater economic potential than current practices in industry. In this study, processes for protein extraction from mustard (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern.) meal using thin <b>stillage</b> from ethanol production and glycerol from biodiesel production were studied. The osmotic potential of thin <b>stillage</b> used in this research was lower than that of water, whereas both the density and the viscosity were higher. The pH was typically 3. 7 - 3. 8, and the total Kjeldahl nitrogen was approximately 0. 08 – 0. 10 %, w/w. Organic compounds identified in thin <b>stillage</b> were isopropanol, ethanol, lactic acid, 1, 3 -propanediol, acetic acid, succinic acid, glycerophosphorylcholine, betaine, glycerol and phenethyl alcohol. In addition, yeasts, bacteria and fungi were also found. Moreover, the salt types and their concentrations in thin <b>stillage</b> were predictable. The salt types present in thin <b>stillage</b> were CaCl 2, NaCl, K 2 SO 4, NaNO 3, Mg(OH) 2, Na 2 SO 4 and KOH. A model thin <b>stillage</b> synthesized {{for the purposes of this}} research had components and chemical and physical properties comparable to those of thin <b>stillage</b> from ethanol production. Protein was extracted from ground, defatted meal using thin <b>stillage</b> at different pHs and salt concentrations. The results showed that pH and salt content affected protein extraction efficiency. However, no differences were found in the efficiency of extraction, SDS-PAGE profile, digestibility, lysine availability or amino acid composition of protein extracted with thin <b>stillage,</b> model thin <b>stillage</b> or sodium chloride solution. Moreover, extracted protein did not display significant hydrolysis. The results from peptide sequencing showed that napin and cruciferin were the most prevalent proteins in the extracted fractions. When increasing the scale of the extraction, the efficiency of protein extraction and the percentage of protein in the extracted protein were decreased. Protein recovery achieved with the complementary protocol was higher than that reported for a published protocol. Allyl isothiocyanate was found in protein extracts...|$|R
