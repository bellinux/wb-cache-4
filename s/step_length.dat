40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the energetics of constant height level bounding gaits in quadruped robots with asymmetric body-mass distribution along the longitudinal axis. Analytical expressions for mechanical specific resistance for two cases of bounding are derived: bounding with equal {{front and rear}} leg <b>step</b> <b>lengths,</b> and bounding with unequal front and rear leg <b>step</b> <b>lengths.</b> Specific resistance {{is found to be}} independent of mass distribution in the first case, and dependent in the second case. The quadruped robot has average nonzero acceleration/deceleration due to unsymmetric distribution of mass when front and rear leg <b>step</b> <b>lengths</b> are equal. Results show that lower body <b>lengths,</b> lower <b>step</b> <b>lengths,</b> and higher heights from the ground level give lower specific resistance. The effect of body-mass asymmetry is to accelerate in the first case, and to reduce specific resistance in the second case.

2500|$|Energetic cost {{increases}} with longer step lengths {{due to increased}} ground reaction forces during double-support and more hip torque during the swing phase. [...] According to the dynamic walking model, mechanical work in the step-to-step transitions increases proportional to <b>step</b> <b>length</b> and can be described by , where [...] is mechanical work rate and [...] is <b>step</b> <b>length,</b> which equates to a proportional increase in net metabolic rate. [...] This relationship is due to reduced vertical force contribution for redirecting the COM at the wider step angles associated with longer step lengths. [...] Larger step lengths also require additional hip torque during the swing phase to travel a wider angle, which contributes to the rate of metabolic cost {{by a factor of}} leg length squared ...|$|E
2500|$|Step width {{variability}} {{is associated}} with the active control of the nervous system for walking stability, and is reduced in the presence of external stabilizers while increased with exposure to balance perturbations. [...] <b>Step</b> <b>length</b> variability is similarly attributed due to a coupling that exists between medio-lateral and fore-aft motion in walking, but to a diminished degree. [...] Step width variability is positively correlated with rate of metabolic cost, and with respect to the variability associated with mediolateral balance, accounts for about 6% of metabolic cost in preferred gait. While some of the energetic cost encountered with step variability may arise due to the net changes in step width and <b>step</b> <b>length,</b> there exists a portion of the cost that {{can be attributed to the}} effort of stability control during walking.|$|E

40|$|We provide Monte Carlo {{estimates}} of the scaling of the length L_n of the longest increasing subsequences of n-steps random walks for several different distributions of <b>step</b> <b>lengths,</b> short and heavy-tailed. Our simulations indicate that, barring possible logarithmic corrections, L_n∼ n^θ with the leading scaling exponent 0. 60 ≲θ≲ 0. 69 for the heavy-tailed distributions of <b>step</b> <b>lengths</b> examined, with values increasing as the distribution becomes more heavy-tailed, and θ≃ 0. 57 for distributions of finite variance, irrespective of the particular distribution. The {{results are consistent with}} existing rigorous bounds for θ, although in a somewhat surprising manner. For random walks with <b>step</b> <b>lengths</b> of finite variance, we conjecture that the correct asymptotic behavior of L_n is given by √(n) n, and also propose the form of the subleading asymptotics. The distribution of L_n was found to follow a simple scaling form with scaling functions that vary with θ. Accordingly, when the <b>step</b> <b>lengths</b> are of finite variance they seem to be universal. The nature of this scaling remains unclear, since we lack a working model, microscopic or hydrodynamic, for the behavior of the length of the longest increasing subsequences of random walks.

2500|$|The {{effect of}} gait {{parameters}} on energetic cost {{is a relationship}} that describes how changes in <b>step</b> <b>length,</b> cadence, step width, and step variability influence the mechanical work and metabolic cost involved in gait. [...] The source of this relationship stems from the deviation of these gait parameters from metabolically optimal values, with the deviations due to environmental, pathological, and other factors.|$|E
2500|$|Metabolic cost is {{naturally}} optimized by {{selection of a}} nominal gait. [...] While external factors such as instability and perceived dangers may temporarily alter the body’s priorities, {{the primary goal of}} minimizing a task-dependent energetic expenditure ultimately dominates the determination of preferred walking gait. [...] As a result, humans tend to select a preferred walking speed that minimizes their cost of transport. The relationship between walking and cost of transport is parabola-like with the preferred walking speed at the minimum, meaning walking at a slower or faster speed can incur a similar increase in energetic cost for a 1-kilometer walk. Within each walking speed, the <b>step</b> <b>length</b> and cadence are also optimized for metabolic cost. [...] While multiple proportional combinations of <b>step</b> <b>length</b> and cadence can be used to achieve the same walking speed, taking faster and shorter steps or slower and longer steps than the optimal combination leads to increased cost of transport.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{multiple}} distinct gait parameters have {{a significant}} impact on the energetic cost of walking, each of these parameters have to be considered when examining the primary goal of metabolic cost optimization. [...] The visualization of such an optimization for walking speed, cadence, and <b>step</b> <b>length</b> can be expressed in the form of a contour map, in which parameter combinations that lie on the same contour line share the same cost of transport (cal/kg/m). [...] The green, red, and blue, dotted lines represent values where cadence, walking speed, and <b>step</b> <b>length</b> are constrained, respectively. [...] These lines can be formed by finding the tangent points that lines representative of several constant parameter values form with the constant COT contours. [...] For example, the optimal COT's for constrained walking speeds (red) can be found by drawing vertical lines and noting where they form a tangent with a contour, as seen with point B in the diagram. [...] A series of these intersections can then form the curve for optimal COT under constrained walking speed. [...] These constrained optimization values not only reflect the naturally selected preferred gait parameters that are observed by fixing a single parameter at different values, but also form part of a predictive map that allows for the identification of the cost of transport for a multivariate system.|$|E

[...] The body may drag along the ground, as in salamanders, or may be substantially elevated, as in monitor lizards. [...] This posture is typically associated with trotting gaits, and the body flexes from side-to-side during movement to increase <b>step</b> <b>length.</b> [...] All limbed reptiles and salamanders use this posture, as does the platypus and several species of frogs that walk. Unusual examples can be found among amphibious fish, such as the mudskipper, which drag themselves across land on their sturdy fins. [...] Among the invertebrates, most arthropodswhich includes the most diverse group of animals, the insectshave a stance best described as sprawling. There is also anecdotal evidence that some octopus species (such as the Pinnoctopus genus) can also drag themselves across land a short distance by hauling their body along by their tentacles (for example to pursue prey between rockpools) - there may be video evidence of this. The semi-erect posture is more accurately interpreted as an extremely elevated sprawling posture. This mode of locomotion is typically found in large lizards such as monitor lizards and tegus.|$|E

40|$|Introduction {{and past}} research: Inertial sensors {{are great for}} {{orientation}} estimation, but they cannot measure relative positions of human body segments directly. In previous work we used ultrasound to estimate distances between body segments [1]. In [2] we presented an easy to use system for gait analysis in clinical practice but also in-home situations. Ultrasound range estimates were fused with data from foot-mounted inertial sensors, using an extended Kalman filter, for 3 D (relative) position and orientation estimation of the feet. Validation: From estimated 3 D positions we calculated <b>step</b> <b>lengths</b> and stride widths and compared this to an optical reference system for validation. Mean (±standard deviation) of absolute differences was 1. 7 cm (± 1. 8 cm) for <b>step</b> <b>lengths</b> and 1. 2 cm (± 1. 2 cm) for stride widths when comparing 54 walking trials of three healthy subjects. Clinical application: Next, the system presented in [2] {{was used in the}} INTERACTION project, for measuring eight stroke subjects during a 10 m walk test [3]. <b>Step</b> <b>lengths,</b> stride widths and stance and swing times were compared with the Berg balance scale score. The first results showed a correlation between <b>step</b> <b>lengths</b> and Berg balance scale scores. To draw real conclusions, more patients and also different activities will be investigated next.

Each step and turn is {{assigned to one of}} a number of random walks, each characteristic of a different behavioral state. Behavioral state assignments may be inferred purely from movement data or may include the habitat type in which the animals are located.

Model fitting is undertaken within a Bayesian framework using the WinBUGS software. These methods allow for identification of different movement states using several properties of observed paths and lead naturally to the formulation of movement models.
