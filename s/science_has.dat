5|$|Edward Grant, a {{historian}} of <b>science,</b> <b>has</b> provided evidence that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered the celestial spheres to be solid {{in the sense}} of three-dimensional or continuous, but most did not consider them solid {{in the sense of}} hard. The consensus was that the celestial spheres were made of some kind of continuous fluid.|$|E

5|$|The {{significance}} of medieval Islamic <b>science</b> <b>has</b> been debated by historians. The traditionalist view holds that it lacked innovation, and was mainly important for handing on ancient knowledge to medieval Europe. The revisionist view holds that it constituted a scientific revolution. Whatever the case, science flourished {{across a wide}} area around the Mediterranean and further afield, for several centuries, {{in a wide range}} of institutions.|$|E
5|$|In many {{accounts}} {{of the development of}} evolutionary theory, Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of <b>science</b> <b>has</b> pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period. Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's Descent of Man, occasionally in strong disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of {{the identities of the}} men who served on the Mary Rose, even {{when it comes to the}} names of the officers, who would have belonged to the gentry. Two admirals and four captains (including Edward and Thomas Howard, who served both positions) are known through records, as well as a few ship masters, pursers, master gunners and other specialists. Forensic <b>science</b> <b>has</b> been used by artists to create reconstructions of faces of eight crew members, and the results were publicized in May 2013.

5|$|Medicinal {{properties}} {{have been}} ascribed to Phallus indusiatus {{from the time}} of the Chinese Tang Dynasty when it was described in pharmacopoeia. The fungus was used to treat many inflammatory, stomach, and neural diseases. Southern China's Miao people continue to use it traditionally for a number of afflictions, including injuries and pains, cough, dysentery, enteritis, leukemia, and feebleness, and it has been prescribed clinically as a treatment for laryngitis, leucorrhea, fever, and oliguria (low urine output), diarrhea, hypertension, cough, hyperlipidemia, and in anticancer therapy. Modern <b>science</b> <b>has</b> probed the biochemical basis of these putative medicinal benefits.|$|E
5|$|The {{confirmation}} of extraterrestrial intelligence {{could have a}} profound impact on religious doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries. However, a survey of people with many different religious beliefs indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, and another study, conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that most people would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it. Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion. Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on <b>science,</b> <b>has</b> stated that the Catholic Church would be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly.|$|E
5|$|While {{it was a}} {{minority}} view in the 1960s, eliminative materialism gained prominence and acceptance during the 1980s. Proponents of this view, such as B.F. Skinner, often made parallels to previous pseudoscientific theories (such {{as that of the}} four humours, the phlogiston theory of combustion, and the vital force theory of life) that have all been successfully eliminated in attempting to establish their thesis {{about the nature of the}} mental. In these cases, <b>science</b> <b>has</b> not produced more detailed versions or reductions of these theories, but rejected them altogether as obsolete. Radical behaviorists, such as Skinner, argued that folk psychology is already obsolete and should be replaced by descriptions of histories of reinforcement and punishment. Such views were eventually abandoned. Patricia and Paul Churchland argued that folk psychology will be gradually replaced as neuroscience matures.|$|E
