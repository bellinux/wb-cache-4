40|$|Aim: Hypoalbuminemia and {{systemic}} inflammatory response (SIR) parameters {{are a key}} role in the prognosis of cancer patients. We aim to investigate the changes of <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> and SIR after chemotherapy, in patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The hypothesis is that improved <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> may be beneficial to the SIR parameters and will reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Patients and Methods: Forty-nine stage III b or stage IV inoperable NSCLC patients were divided into two groups, depending on whether albumin administration was given before chemotherapy. The Karnofsky performance score (KPS), nutritional status including body mass index (BMI), and <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> were evaluated. SIR was evaluated by investigating the changes of the C-reactive protein (CRP), calculating the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and the platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR), before and after chemotherapy. The chemotherapy-induced toxicity was also evaluated. Results: In the group of patients without albumin administration before chemotherapy, the <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> was significantly decreased (P 0. 05), even though the patients may have been malnourished or diagnosed with pleural effusions. There were no significant changes in the SIR parameters.

40|$|Discussions whether hypoalbuminemia is just {{a marker}} for the malnutrition-inflammation {{syndrome}} {{as well as for}} the increased morbidity and mortality of those patients or is it an etiological factor, are becoming more and more intense. In this research of the relation between hypoalbuminemia and the complications that threaten the vascular access with special reference to infection, and consequently to the life of the patients treated with chronic haemodialysis, we have chosen 120 patients with terminal renal insufficiency (ESRD) treated at the Clinical Hospital Mostar by chronic haemodialysis. The chosen patients for this study were observed throughout a time period of 18 months. Only the patients who, at the moment of starting the research did not exhibit either a local or a systemic infection, as well as no signs of any other complication that might have endangered the vascular access and consequently the life of the patient, were selected. From the 120 (100. 0 %) patients, 86. 8 % of them had a <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> below 40, 0 g/L. By analysing the research results of the clinical material, it has been established that in patients with <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> below 40. 0 g/L, the infection incidence was significantly higher than in those patients with the <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> above 40. 0 g/L (c 2 = 7. 215 P = 0. 0077). The complication incidence is significantly higher (c 2 = 9. 92 P = 0. 0022) among the patients with <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> below 40. 0 g/L, than in those patients with higher serum level.

40|$|Ionized calcium is the physiologically active {{fraction}} of serum calcium and therefore its evaluation {{is an important}} clinical parameter both in mammals and birds. In the present study, concentration of total calcium (tCa), ionized calcium (iCa) based on the <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> and on the total protein content, and corrected total calcium (ctCa) based on the <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> were evaluated, and the correlation between these biochemical parameters was investigated in broiler chickens. The average serum iCa was 4. 91 ± 0. 49 g/dL representing 51. 76 ± 0. 53 % from the ctCa. The correlation coefficient between tCa and albumin (r = 0. 8608) was greater than that between tCa and total protein (r = 0. 7997). Our study illustrated that iCa and ctCa concentrations calculated from tCa and albumin are better indicators of calcium homeostasis than tCa concentrations alone...|$|R
40|$|Context: Periodontitis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease caused by bacterial {{infection of the}} supporting tissues around the teeth. <b>Serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> might be the practical marker of general health status. Albumin concentration is associated with nutrition and inflammation. Aims: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the relationship between periodontal health status and <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels.</b> Subjects and Methods: A total of 60 subjects of both genders with age range of 40 - 70 years were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups viz. Group I; clinically healthy subjects and Group II; patients with chronic periodontitis, that is, loss of attachment ≥ 5 mm. Serum albumin concentration was estimated by bromocresol green albumin method. Statistical Analysis Used: Student′s unpaired t-test. Results: The mean value of <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> for Group I was 4. 815 g/dL with standard deviation (SD) of 0. 127 and for Group II, the mean value of <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> was 4. 219 g/dL (SD 0. 174). The difference between <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> in Group I and Group II were found to be statistically significant (P ≤ 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Some {{physicians}} have reported lower <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> {{in patients with}} major depression in Western countries. In this study, the relationship between <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> and mood disorders (including mania and major depression) was investigated during the acute phases in Taiwanese psychiatric inpatients. Methods: A review of medical charts during a 1 -year period {{was carried out in}} a popu-lation of 213 Taiwanese psychiatric inpatients that included 61 patients with mood disorders (with or without suicide attempts). The collected data included age, body weight, height, <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels,</b> and routine blood biochemistry examination results. These data were compared with data from a healthy control group (N= 32) drawn from the staff of the psychiatric ward. Statistical analysis was done using covariance after age adjustment. Results: The mean <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were 40. 2 ¡ 4. 0 g/L in patients with mania (N= 25), 39. 8 ¡ 2. 8 g/L in patients with major depression (N= 36), and 45. 8 ¡ 2. 0 g/L in the control group. Patients with mania (F= 64. 6, p = 0. 000) and major depression (F= 68. 9, p = 0. 000), respectively, had significantly lower albumin levels than the control group after age adjustment. However, for the patients with major depression, no significant difference in <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were found between patients who had attempted suicide and those who had not. Conclusion: Lower <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were noted during the acute phases of mania and major depression in Taiwanese psychiatric inpatients...|$|E
40|$|Nephrotic {{syndrome}} (NS) is a glomerular disorder {{characterized by}} massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the correlation between <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> and percentage of edema during nephrotic stage in children with NS. Cross-sectional design with correlational analytic was used in this study. The subjects of this study were outpatients and inpatients with NS during nephrotic stage, aged between 1 and 14 years old, admitted to Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung, Cibabat Hospital, and Ujung Berung Hospital from August 2009 to January 2010. Percentage of edema was calculated by substracting total body water (TBW) during illness to ideal TBW, then divided the result by ideal TBW. Subjects were 29 children, consisted of 26 boys and 3 girls. Mean <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> was 1. 45 g/dL and percentage of edema was 21. 6 %. Analysis using Spearman correlation test showed a highly significant correlation (p= 0. 006) between <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> and percentage of edema in children with NS during nephrotic stage (r=- 0. 501). In conclusion, there is a negative correlation between <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> and percentage of edema during nephrotic stage in children with NS...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{separate}} {{roles of}} malnutrition, advanced age, and stage of tumor growth as causes of impairment of delayed hypersensitivity response (DHR) was studied in 111 patients with solid tumors and in 56 nonneoplastic control patients matched for age, anatomical site of disease, degree of illness, and nutritional status. Pretreatment DHR to recall antigens (tuberculin, Candida, streptokinase-streptodornase, trichophyton) and to dinitrochlorobenzene in cancer patients was 9 % anergic, 43 % hypoergic, and 48 % normoergic; the distri-bution of DHR in controls {{was not significantly}} different. In cancer patients, the <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> showed an in-verse correlation with the stage of tumor (p < 0. 01) and a positive correlation with the DHR (p < 0. 001); the <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> {{was also in the}} controls positively correlated with the DHR (p < 0. 01), indicating that malnutrition in neoplasti...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. The {{identification}} {{of risk factors}} could {{play a role in}} improving early postoperative outcome for rectal cancer surgery patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relationship between short-course preoperative radiotherapy (RT), <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> and the development of postoperative complications in patients after anterior rectal resection due to rectal cancer without creation of diverting stoma. Methods. This retrospective study included patients with histopathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the rectum by and the clinical stage of T 2 -T 4 operated on between 2007 and 2012. All the patients underwent open anterior rectal resection with no diverting stoma creation. Preoperative <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> was measured in each patient. Tumor location was noted intraoperatively as the distance from the inferior tumor margin to the anal verge. Tumor size was measured and noted by the pathologist who assessed specimens. Some of the patients received short-course preoperative RT, and some did not. The patients were divided into two groups (group 1 with short-course preoperative RT, group 2 with no short-course preoperative RT). Postoperative complications included clinically apparent anastomotic leakage, wound infection, diffuse peritonitis and pneumonia. They were compared between the groups, in relation to preoperative <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level,</b> patients age, tumor size and location. Results. The study included 107 patients (51 in the group 1 and 56 in the group 2). There were no significant difference in age (p = 0. 95), and gender (p = 0. 12) and tumor distance from anal verge (p = 0. 53). The size of rectal carcinoma was significantly higher in the group 1 than in the group 2 (51. 37 ± 12. 04 mm vs 45. 57 ± 9. 81 mm, respectively; p = 0. 007). The preoperative <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> was significantly lower in the group 1 than in the group 2 (34. 80 ± 2. 85 g/L vs 37. 55 ± 2. 74 g/L, respectively; p < 0. 001). A significant correlation between the tumor size and the <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> was found (p = 0. 042). Overall, postoperative complications were observed in 13 (25. 5 %) patients in the group 1 and in 10 (17. 8 %) patients in the group 2 with significant difference between the groups (p = 0. 18). A significantly lower <b>level</b> of <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> was found in patients postoperative complications and in those who died. A significant difference in anastomotic leakage occurrence between groups was also found (p = 0. 039). Male gender and the lower <b>level</b> of <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> were significant predictors for anastomotic leakage occurrence (p = 0. 05 and p = 0. 002, respectively), but preoperative RT had no significant impact on it. Conclusions. A lower <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level,</b> but not short-course of preoperative RT, was significantly associated with postoperative complications development after rectal resection with no diverting stoma...|$|R
