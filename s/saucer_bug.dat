5000|$|Naucoridae is a {{small family}} of insects {{commonly}} known as the creeping water <b>bugs</b> and <b>Saucer</b> <b>bugs.</b> They are very similar in appearance and behavior to the giant water bugs (Belostomatidae), and also occur in ponds and other still waters. However, most species are lotic, occurring in streams, rivers, and even a few on waterfalls. There are approximately 395 species in 40 genera in 5 subfamilies. [...] Their distribution is primarily tropical, although a few taxa occur in northern and southern temperate regions.|$|R
40|$|Aquatic {{insects in}} the family Naucoridae are {{commonly}} known as creeping water <b>bugs</b> or <b>saucer</b> <b>bugs.</b> The New World genus Ambrysus (Heteroptera: Naucoridae) includes two subgenera in Mexico: Ambrysus (Syncollus) La Rivers and Ambrysus (Ambrysus) Stal. Syncollus includes nine species with mostly Neotropical distributions. The subgenus Syncollus was reviewed and the status of the Mexican fauna was evaluated. Six species of this group are present in Mexico; three of them were described as new in this study. In the subgenus Ambrysus, the A. hybridus Montandon species complex was revised and includes nine species distributed in North America. One of the Mexican species was resurrected as a valid species and two other were considered the same as a third species that was not well known prior to this work. The Ambrysus guttatipennis Stal species complex also was revised and includes eleven species distributed in North America. Six species of this group from Mexico were described as new...|$|R
