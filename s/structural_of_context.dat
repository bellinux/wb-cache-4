40|$|The {{secondary}} {{structure of a}} pre-mRNA influences a number of processing steps including alternative splicing. Since most splicing regulatory proteins bind to single-stranded RNA, the sequestration of RNA into double strands could prevent their binding. Here, we analyzed the {{secondary structure}} <b>context</b> <b>of</b> experimentally determined splicing enhancer and silencer motifs in their natural pre-mRNA context. We found that these splicing motifs are significantly more single-stranded than controls. These findings were validated by transfection experiments, where the effect of enhancer or silencer motifs on exon skipping was much more pronounced in single-stranded conformation. We {{also found that the}} <b>structural</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> predicted splicing motifs is under selection, suggesting a general importance of secondary structures on splicing and adding another level of evolutionary constraints on pre-mRNAs. Our results explain the action of mutations that affect splicing and indicate that the <b>structural</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> splicing motifs is part of the mRNA splicing code...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is the {{supervised}} classification of semi-structured data. A formal model based on bayesian classification is developed while addressing the integration of the document structure into classification tasks. We define what we call the <b>structural</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> occurrence for unstructured data, and we derive a recursive formulation in which parameters are used to weight the contribution <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> element relatively to the others. A simplified version of this formal model is implemented to carry out textual documents classification experiments. First results show, for a adhoc weighting strategy, that the <b>structural</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> word occurrences has a significant impact on classification results comparing to the performance of a simple multinomial naive Bayes classifier. The proposed implementation competes on the Reuters- 21578 data with the SVM classifier associated or not with the splitting <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> components.

40|$|Site-directed {{mutagenesis}} {{has been}} used to change the nucleotide C in the wobble position of tRNA(1 Gly) (CCC) to U. The mutated tRNA was tested for its ability to read glycine codons in an in vitro protein-synthesizing system programmed with the phage message MS 2 -RNA that had been modified by site-directed mutagenesis so as to make it possible to monitor conveniently the reading of all four glycine codons. The results showed that while the efficiency of tRNA(1 Gly) (UCC) was comparable to that of mycoplasma tRNA(Gly) (UCC) in the reading of the codon GGA, the mycoplasma tRNA(Gly) was far more efficient than the tRNA(1 Gly) (UCC) in the reading of the codons GGU and GGC. Thus, the anticodon UCC, when present in the <b>structural</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> the tRNA(1 Gly) molecule, behaved as predicted by the wobble rules while in the <b>structural</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> the mycoplasma tRNA(Gly) it read without discrimination between the nucleotides in the third codon position, in violation of the wobble restrictions. The result with the codon GGG showed that the anticodon UCC, when present in tRNA(1 Gly), was considerably less efficient in reading this codon {{than it was in the}} <b>structural</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> the mycoplasma tRNA(Gly).

30|$|This {{article focuses}} on why a crisis in {{grassroots}} governance occurred. The particular perspective adopted for this analysis {{is the relationship between}} crisis and policy implementation. I argue that examining only local state behaviors does not suffice, and the <b>structural</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> policy implementation must be brought in for the analysis of implementation. In the grassroots society, there are two dimensions in the <b>structural</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> policy implementation: the applicability of policy and the pressure for implementation. The applicability of policy refers to the compatibility between policies and the local grassroots conditions. If policies are compatible with these conditions, the policies are applicable and practical. In contrast, if policies are incompatible with local grassroots conditions, the policies are inapplicable and impractical. The applicability of policies affects the difficulty of implementing policy; the more applicable a policy is, the less difficult it is to implement. There are a number of factors impacting the applicability of policies, such as the quality of policy making (Ning 2000; Huang 2011), how complicated the grassroots conditions are (Wang 2008), and how complicated the bureaucratic structure is (Chen et al. 2013). This article does not discuss these factors in detail but simply provides a holistic perspective to look into the characteristics of policy implementation.|$|R

However, population features such as the inherent variability in dendritic morphology between cells belonging to the same neuronal type are often overlooked when studying computation in neural networks. While detailed models for morphology and electrophysiology exist for many types of single neurons, the role of detailed single cell morphology in the population has not been studied quantitatively or computationally. Here we use the <b>structural</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> the neural tissue in which dendritic trees exist to drive their generation in silico. We synthesize the entire population of dentate gyrus granule cells, the most numerous cell type in the hippocampus, by growing their dendritic trees within their characteristic dendritic fields bounded by the realistic <b>structural</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> (1) the granule cell layer that contains all somata and (2) the molecular layer that contains the dendritic forest. This process enables branching statistics to be linked to larger scale neuroanatomical features. We find large differences in dendritic total length and individual path length measures as a function of location in the dentate gyrus and of somatic depth in the granule cell layer. We also predict the number of unique granule cell dendrites invading a given volume in the molecular layer. This work enables the complete population-level study of morphological properties and provides a framework to develop complex and realistic neural network models...|$|R

To ascertain the <b>structural</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> the island and the offshore continuation of the structures identified onshore, bathymetric, high-resolution reflection seismic and magnetic surveys were conducted on the shelf. The analyses of these detailed data show that the width of the present-day northwestern Basse-Terre shelf has been built by the accumulation of the Pleistocene detrital sediments over a volcanic substratum representing the prolongation on the shelf of an onshore volcanic edifice that bounds the Bouillante Bay on the south. The sedimentary cover has recorded two important regressive phases. Deciphering the structural frame has confirmed that the Bouillante sector is a key geodynamic area where the major tectonic and volcanic structures of the inner arc of the Lesser Antilles join. In this area, the N 160 o Basse-Terre volcanic axis, the N 140 o Montserrat-Bouillante volcanic and fault system, the EW Bouillante-Capesterre fault system, linked to the E-W-trending Marie-Galante graben, join up and their relationships have been specified. The N 140 oE Montserrat-Bouillante fault system ends on a N 160 o escarpment and basement high which would represent the relay of a major NNW-SSE- strike-slip fault system along the inner arc of the Lesser Antilles, linking the Montserrat-Bouillante fault to that of Les Saintes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the consequences of}} HIV/AIDS related morbidity and mortality on rural households in South Africa's Eastern Cape region. The literature suggests a range of both individual and household level factors which serve to differentiate the effects of AIDS illness and death on affected households. Furthermore the effects of HIV/AIDS are not only differentiated, they are also distributed. The social reciprocity undergirding African livelihoods both ameliorates HIV/AIDS-related livelihood shock and simultaneously serves to transmit these shocks to otherwise unaffected households. The six case studies presented demonstrate the highly differentiated consequences of HIV illness and death on households, {{and the extent to}} which these effects are significantly mediated by a range of household level factors. The consequences of HIV/AIDS are shaped by household pre-illness asset levels, care and dependency burdens and finally, the extent to which the household members either acknowledge the illness (enabling them to better engage with treatment options) or alternatively, revert to denial. The consequences of HIV/AIDS are also significantly mediated by infected individuals' household headship status and resources. In the rural Eastern Cape, the <b>structural</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> unemployment, limited prospects for agrarian production and the exclusion of prime age adults from social grants, serves to pattern vulnerability by rendering unemployed, prime-age adults relatively weak economic agents. The empirical material accordingly suggests the effects of the morbidity and mortality particularly of peripheral (i. e. non household head) and non resource contributing individuals is relatively limited (at least in the short to medium term). Within a <b>structural</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> impoverishment and economic disempowerment, HIV/AIDS therefore does not constitute a homogenous or equal shock to all affected households...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Clinical {{practice}} guidelines {{have been}} a popular tool {{for the improvement of}} health care through the implementation of evidence from systematic research. Yet, it is increasingly clear that knowledge alone is insufficient to change practice. The social, cultural, and material contexts within which practice occurs may invite or reject innovation, complement or inhibit the activities required for success, and sustain or alter adherence to entrenched practices. However, knowledge translation (KT) models are limited in providing insight about how and why contextual contingencies interact, the causal mechanisms linking <b>structural</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>context</b> and individual agency, and how these mechanisms influence KT. Another limitation of KT models is the neglect of methods to engage potential adopters of the innovation in critical reflection about aspects <b>of</b> <b>context</b> that influence practice, the relevance and meaning of innovation in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> practice, and the identification of strategies for bringing about meaningful change. Discussion This paper presents a KT model, the Critical Realism and the Arts Research Utilization Model (CRARUM), that combines critical realism and arts-based methodologies. Critical realism facilitates understanding of clinical settings by providing insight into the interrelationship between its structures and potentials, and individual action. The arts nurture empathy, and can foster reflection on the ways in which contextual factors influence and shape clinical practice, and how they may facilitate or impede change. The combination of critical realism and the arts within the CRARUM model promotes the successful embedding of interventions, and greater impact and sustainability. Conclusion CRARUM has the potential to strengthen the science of implementation research by addressing the complexities of practice settings, and engaging potential adopters to critically reflect on existing and proposed practices and strategies for sustaining change. </p...|$|R
