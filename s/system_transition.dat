50|$|Once the {{pathways}} {{have been created}} short-term 'interim' objectives can be formed through Backcasting (as illustrated by the purple lines in the diagram) and actors within the niche level {{have the opportunity to}} form innovative solutions to the problem that may contribute to one of more of {{the pathways}}. Transition management will seek to identify those niches that will likely destabilise the regime level and contribute the most to its transformation. Once identified these niche opportunities can be supported by regime changes such as new policy implementation that provide new funding opportunities. In addition to deliberative steering of such choices, pressure can also filter down from the landscape level in the form of market forces which may also steer transition. Experiments within the niche level form a series of 'development rounds' which provide information to decision makers regarding the viability of different options. The information provided by the development rounds is evaluated and if the options are considered to be viable the solution is rolled out primarily on a small scale. Evaluative information {{can also be used to}} inform the overall vision created (as illustrated in red in the diagram). Eventually the development of options snowball down a particular pathway and a full <b>system</b> <b>transition</b> takes place. Not all development and transition time-scales are consistent within and between the different levels, actors and domains; some change much more quickly than others. In particular, the landscape level is much slower to change than the regime or niche levels; this has led to the concept being labelled as chaotic and non-linear in nature.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{mathematical}} structures and techniques related to formal specification and verification. We mainly focus on structures and techniques related to both concurrent systems and formal semantics of specification languages. We provide an abstract unifying framework for various different models of <b>transition</b> <b>systems</b> such as unlabeled <b>transition</b> <b>systems,</b> labeled <b>transition</b> <b>systems,</b> algebraic <b>transition</b> <b>systems,</b> and concurrent <b>transition</b> <b>systems.</b> An abstract simulation theory based on {{forward and backward}} simulation relations is defined and correctness proof are given. Concurrent <b>transition</b> <b>systems</b> are defined as an abstract model for concurrency. Sufficient conditions are derived that guarantee a global, partially ordered causality relation associated with concurrent <b>transition</b> <b>systems.</b> We analyze the notion of calculus and its associated proof principle 'calculus closure induction'. The relations between calculi and algebraic closure operators, compact derivation relations and algebras are analyzed. We define a temporal logic and an abstract refinement concept for new and generic models for concurrency called concurrent runs. A formal definition of ASMs embedded into the proposed framework as special algebraic <b>transition</b> <b>systems</b> is given. Case studies provide applications of both the introduced temporal logic and the refinement concept. The formal semantics of SDL- 2000 approved by the ITU in November 2000 is illustrated...|$|R
