50|$|Rules for Olympic luge {{competitions}} are {{set by the}} International Luge Federation (FIL) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). They entrust 5 {{officials with}} making decisions about whether competition rules have been followed: a technical delegate, three jury members from different countries, and an international judge. These decisions are implemented and enforced by a race director, to whom the overall responsibility for running the competition is given, but who is assisted by a <b>start</b> <b>leader</b> who coordinates the starting area, a finish leader who coordinates the finish area, and a Chief of Track {{who is in charge}} of track maintenance. Under the rules, competitors were guaranteed a minimum of five official training runs in the days prior to the competition. The competition itself consists of four runs. Athletes begin their runs on their sleds at a starting block, use their hands to push themselves off in the starting area, and then on their backs on the sleds through the remainder of the course. Athletes are ranked by the speed of their times measured between their start and the finish line at the bottom of the track.|$|E
