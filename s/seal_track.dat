Grey seals are benthic foragers, and thus experience acoustic noise throughout the water column, which makes them a good model species for a case study of the potential impacts of shipping noise. We used ship track data from the Celtic Sea, <b>seal</b> <b>track</b> data and a coupled ocean-acoustic modelling system to assess the noise exposure of grey seals along their tracks. It was found that the animals experience step changes in sound levels up to ~ 20 dB at a frequency of 125 Hz, and ~ 10 dB on average over 10 – 1000 Hz when they dive through the thermocline, particularly during summer. Our results showed large seasonal differences in the noise level experienced by the seals. These results reveal the actual noise exposure by the animals and could help in marine spatial planning.

40|$|Adult female {{southern}} elephant seals {{are predominantly}} pelagic, coming ashore biannually solely to breed and to moult. The {{success of the}} post-moult foraging trip has direct implications for female breeding success and the final weaning weight and future survival of the pup and may impact population fluctuations. In 2007 and 2008, a total of 13 post-moult adult female southern elephant seals from sub-Antarctic Marion Island were tracked via satellite transmitters. Ten of the resulting tracks were completed by recurrence of the female to Marion Island, with mean track durations of 250 days. The total trip distances ranged between 22 810. 6 km and 13 169. 7 km (mean = 18 980. 9 km). <b>Seals</b> <b>tracked</b> in 2008 displayed longer total trip distances (20 450. 6 km ± 5362. 5 km) than <b>seals</b> <b>tracked</b> in 2007 (16 776. 3 km ± 6106. 5 km). The mean maximum distance attained was 2 793. 9 km ± 845. 6 km and did not vary between years. In contrast to southern elephant <b>seals</b> <b>tracked</b> from Kerguelen Island in 2003 / 2004, adult female seals (this study) travelled extensive distances due west of Marion Island. Only three individuals travelled to and within the Antarctic sea ice during the study period. The remaining animals travelled extensively along the South West Indian Ridge, often resulting in overlap of large portions of the tracks. Tracks displayed areas of restricted movement, which either coincided with areas of higher chlorophyll concentrations, anomalous sea-surface temperatures or mesoscale sea-surface height anomalies. An understanding {{of the relationships between}} southern elephant seal female movements and the variability of oceanographic features may help to identify driving forces of Marion Island southern elephant seal population fluctuations.

40|$|International audienceGrey (Halichoerus grypus) and harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) are {{sympatric}} seal species, {{but they}} display distinct strategies of habitat use and connectivity between haulout sites. The distribution patterns and variations in relative abundance of both species were investigated along the French {{coast of the}} English Channel, at the southern limit of their range where seal numbers are increasing. Regular censuses conducted at all main haulout sites in mainland France showed significant seasonal variations at most sites, with more harbour seals counted during summer (breeding and moulting seasons), and more grey seals during summer only in the eastern English Channel. Trends in maximum haulout numbers at haulout sites showed a significant increase {{over the last five}} years, ranging from 9. 7 to 30. 9 % per year for harbour seals, and from 5. 8 % (in the western English Channel) to 49. 2 % (in the eastern English Channel) per year for grey seals. These rates of increase in grey seal numbers are not linked to local pup production and most probably result from seal movements from the southwest British Isles and the North Sea, respectively. Aerial surveys conducted across the English Channel showed that most seal observations at sea were concentrated in the north-eastern English Channel. Telemetry showed that the 28 harbour <b>seals</b> <b>tracked</b> remained highly coastal, within a radius of 100 km from their haulout sites, and did not move to other known colonies. Grey seals moved much greater distances, reaching up to 1200 km from their capture site.

40|$|Population {{structure}} {{and patterns of}} habitat use among ringed seals (Phoca hispida) are poorly known, in part because seasonal movements have not been adequately documented. We monitored the movements of 98 ringed seals in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas between 1990 and 2006 using three forms of telemetry. In the winter—spring period (when the seals were occupying shorefast ice), we used radio and ultra-sonic tags to track movements {{above and below the}} ice, respectively. We used satellite-linked transmitters in summer and fall (when the seals ranged away from their winter sites) to track at-sea movements. In the shorefast ice habitat, the home ranges of 27 adult males ranged from to 13. 9 km 2 (median = 0. 628) while the home ranges of 28 adult females ranged from to 27. 9 km 2 (median = 0. 652). The 3 -dimensional volumes used by 9 <b>seals</b> <b>tracked</b> acoustically under the ice averaged 0. 07 (SD = 0. 04) km 3 for subadults and adult males and 0. 13 (SD = 0. 04) km 3 for adult females.

40|$|Abstract Diving {{physiology}} and at-sea {{behavior of a}} juvenile leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx) were oppor-tunistically measured in the Antarctic Peninsula during winter 2002. Total body oxygen stores were estimated from measures of hematocrit, hemoglobin, myoglobin, and total blood volume and were used to calculate an aerobic dive limit (ADL). Movement patterns and div-ing behavior were measured by equipping the seal with a Satellite Relay Data Logger that transmitted data from 8 – 31 August 2002.

Climatic warming is diminishing Arctic snow and sea ice and threatens to endanger ringed seals {{in the foreseeable}} future. We investigated the population structure and connectedness within and among three subspecies: Arctic (P. hispida hispida), Baltic (P. hispida botnica), and Lake Saimaa (P. hispida saimensis) ringed seals to assess their capacity to respond to rapid environmental changes.

40|$|International audienceBackground: In marine pelagic ecosystems, {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of biomass is heterogeneous and dynamic. At large scales, physical processes are the main driving forces of biomass distribution. At fine scales, both biotic and abiotic parameters {{are likely to be}} key determinants in the horizontal and vertical distribution of biomass, with direct consequences on the foraging behaviour of diving predators. However, fine scale three-dimensional (3 D) spatial interactions between diving predators and their prey are still poorly known. Results: We reconstructed and examined the patterns of southern elephant seals 3 D path during the bottom phase of their dives, and related them to estimated prey encounter density. We found that southern elephant <b>seal</b> <b>tracks</b> at bottom are strongly dominated by a single horizontal direction. In high prey density areas, seals travelled shorter distances but their track remained strongly orientated according to a main linear direction. Horizontal, and more importantly, vertical deviations from this main direction, were related negatively to the estimated prey density. We found that prey encounter density decreased with diving depth but tended to be more predictable. Conclusion: Southern elephant seal behaviour during the bottom phase of their dives suggest that the prey are dispersed and distributed into layers in which their density relates to the vertical spread of the layer. The linear trajectories performed by the elephant seals would allow to explore the largest volume of water, maximizing the opportunities of prey encounter, while travelling great horizontal distance...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of pinniped haulout behaviour can {{provide information on}} how animals interact with their environment, their foraging strategies and the behaviour of their prey. For Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddelli, knowledge of haulout patterns and the environmental drivers of haulout is comprehensive for the austral spring and summer, but is poorly described outside this period. Pinniped behaviour is commonly examined using satellite telemetry; however, {{it is unclear whether}} the behavioural state of the seal can itself influence data acquisition. We examined haulout behaviour of female Weddell seals in eastern Antarctica over 3 winters (March to August, 2006 - 2008) using satellite-linked data loggers. Haulout behaviour followed a diel cycle with predominantly nocturnal haulouts. The environmental variables wind speed and temperature were influential on haulout, with seals tending to haul out more in lower winds and at higher temperatures. Haulout duration decreased across the winter, as did the number of satellite uplinks, suggesting that haulout duration played a role in data acquisition. There was no evidence of a decline in tag condition over this period, indicating that the decrease in uplinks was primarily the result of the winter behaviour of the seals. Overall, the number of haulout locations in the data set was over-represented, with more uplinks per hour occurring when the seals were hauled out than when they were at sea. For Weddell seals and other ice <b>seals,</b> <b>tracking</b> data that include haulout locations can bias spatial representations of foraging behaviour (e. g. haulout sites may be mistaken for regions of area-restricted search). 10 page(s...|$|R

The park is resident to 1 of only 3 gray seal colonies in France. The at-sea habitat use of gray seals in the marine park is poorly understood and direct interactions with human activities are expected. We investigated habitat selection of gray seals within the marine park to provide spatial planning recommendations to local conservation management. We obtained data from 19 <b>seals</b> <b>tracked</b> between 2010 and 2013. We used generalized linear models to investigate their habitat selection using distance to haulout, distance to shore, bathymetry, tidal current, and sediment type as explanatory variables. The tracked individuals spent 67 % of their time within the boundaries of the marine park. We investigated return trips to focus on habitat selection within the Iroise Sea. The deviance explained by the final model was 76 %. Distance to haulout explained 47 % of the deviance (seals selected short distances), bathymetry explained 40 % (with bimodal selection for waters shallower than 50 m or deeper than 150 m), distance to shore explained 6 % (selected distances less than 40 km), current explained 5 % (selected weak currents), and sediment explained 2 % (selected rocky areas). Habitat selection was concentrated in shallow waters located in the main archipelago of the marine park. The map of selected habitat will help identify potential conflicts of space use between seals and human activities such as fishing and leisure activities.

40|$|Fidelity to {{foraging}} {{sites and}} foraging strategies is potentially beneficial to individuals using habitats with patchily distributed resources, as {{in a number}} of marine mammal species. We assessed inter-annual and long term (up to eight year) patterns in the spatial distribution and diving strategies used by southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) from sub-Antarctic Marion Island, instrumented with satellite-relay data loggers over multiple foraging migrations. We calculated inter-annual three-dimensional (3 D) kernel density (KD) range overlaps for <b>seals</b> <b>tracked</b> over at least two post-moult foraging migrations in order to assess overlap for both the water depths and temperatures targeted during foraging migrations. We used intra-class correlation coefficients from linear mixed effects models to calculate intra- and inter-individual variance for a series of track and dive metrics. A repeatability index was ultimately derived for individual metrics, where higher values (between 0. 5 and 1) indicate individually unique consistent behaviours, since greater variance occurs between, and not within, individual behaviours. Individual seals displayed high levels of fidelity to vertical depth layers where mean overlap for 95 % 3 D KD homerange estimates were 52. 6 % (inter-annual) and 34. 3 % (multi-year). Similarly, high levels of fidelity to temperature zones were evident where mean overlap for 95 % 3 D KD homerange estimates were 48 % (inter-annual) and 35 % (multi-year). Repeatability index values ranged between 0. 38 and 0. 57 for all metrics tested, indicating that the variance between individuals tested was generally not substantially more than within individuals. This study is the first to show that southern elephant seals display high levels of foraging niche fidelity in terms of spatial areas used, vertical depth layers targeted, as well as preferred in situ thermal conditions. Such observed inter-migration stability in habitat use patterns likely confers long-term energetic advantages to individual seals, despite little evidence for individually unique behaviours between these seals. While previous studies suggested likely inter-sex and inter-age-class avoidance of intra-specific competition in southern elephant seals, the apparent lack of individually unique foraging strategies reported here indicates that there is little individual level avoidance of intra-specific competition...|$|R
50|$|During 1964, the Association {{decided to}} {{celebrate}} the tenth anniversary of {{the closure of the}} Number 1 tram route to Papanui, which {{had been one of the}} final two lines to close in 1954. At the time, contractors had not yet <b>sealed</b> over the <b>tracks</b> between Blighs Road and the former terminus, and so horse-tram 50 was restored to its Christchurch Tramway Company appearance as tram 43, and transported to Papanui where it ran for a week in August 1964. This was hugely popular, and resulted in an increase of membership with the Association, which had become the Tramway Historical Society early that year.|$|R
