5|$|The Palace of Westminster, {{the medieval}} royal palace {{used as the}} home of the British parliament, was largely {{destroyed}} by fire on 16 October 1834.

The <b>sticks</b> were disposed of in a careless manner in the two furnaces under the House of Lords, which caused a chimney fire in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords' chamber and up through the walls.|$|E

5|$|To {{describe}} {{the details of}} the attack and its background, Dumont de Montigny and Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz, the leading 18th-century historians of Louisiana, drew on information collected from French women taken captive during the massacre. They explained that the Natchez had conspired with other nations but had attacked a few days earlier than the date agreed upon and that they had used a system of bundles of <b>sticks</b> held by each of the conspiring tribes in order to count down the number of days remaining until the strike. The undetected destruction of a couple of the <b>sticks</b> in the Natchez Grand Village derailed the count, although the reason for the lost <b>sticks</b> differed in each historian's account. The other nations called off their participation in the plot because of the Natchez' premature attack, and therefore the very existence of the conspiracy remained conjectural.|$|E

40|$|A {{fixed base}} {{laboratory}} tracking {{study was conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} <b>stick</b> displacement and <b>stick</b> force characteristics on human tracking performance. Three different levels of control <b>stick</b> force/displacement characteristics and <b>stick</b> electrical gain were varied to observe their influence on RMS (Root Mean Square) tracking error and RMS control activity (<b>stick</b> output). The results indicated that both RMS tracking error and RMS control activity were influenced by the three different levels of control <b>stick</b> force/displacement characteristics and <b>stick</b> electrical gain. The human neuromotor time constant was affected by the electrical control gain of the <b>stick</b> while the spring stiffness of the <b>stick</b> influenced the time delay characteristics of the human response behavior...|$|R

5|$|Another set of officials, {{the chain}} crew, are {{responsible}} for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large <b>sticks</b> with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people â€“ {{two members of the}} chain crew will hold either of the two <b>sticks,</b> while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.|$|E
5|$|Beyond French fries, {{the company}} has {{introduced}} several other side products {{over the course of}} its existence.

Originally made from whole, sliced onions, they were reformulated into a formed product made from onion paste in 2001 as part of a menu revamp. In the same 2001 menu revamp, the company added an onion ring-specific dipping sauce, and emphasized it again during its 99Â¢ BK Value Menu introduction in 2002. As part of its BK Cravers value menu introduction in 2005, the company briefly sold jalapeÃ±o poppers accompanied by a side of ranch dressing as part of its national menu. The same menu added mozzarella <b>sticks</b> with a side of marinara sauce; the mozzarella <b>sticks</b> have since been relegated to a regional menu item in the United States, but are sold on the national menu in Canada.|$|E
