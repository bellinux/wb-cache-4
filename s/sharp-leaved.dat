"Nay, but," [...] {{some of you}} {{instantly}} answer, [...] "if we {{had been}} as long accustomed to square-leaved ash trees {{as we have been}} to <b>sharp-leaved</b> ash trees, we should like them just as well." [...] Do not think it. Are you not much more accustomed to gray whinstone and brown sandstone than you are to rubies or emeralds? and yet will you tell me you think them as beautiful? Are you not more accustomed to the ordinary voices of men than to the perfect accents of sweet singing? yet do you not instantly declare the song to be loveliest? Examine well the channels of your admiration, and you will find that they are, in verity, as unchangeable as the channels of your heart's blood; that just as by the pressure of a bandage, or by unwholesome and perpetual action of some part of the body, that blood may be wasted or arrested, and in its stagnancy cease to nourish the frame, or in its disturbed flow affect it with incurable disease, so also admiration itself may, by the bandages of fashion, bound close over the eyes and the arteries of the soul, be arrested in its natural pulse and healthy flow; but that wherever the artificial pressure is removed, it will return into that bed which has been traced for it by the finger of God.|$|E

50|$|Potamogeton acutifolius is a European {{species of}} aquatic {{plant in the}} family Potamogetonaceae, known by the common name <b>sharp-leaved</b> pondweed. It is {{threatened}} and declining in {{at least part of}} its range.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the genus}} Potamogeton, <b>Sharp-leaved</b> {{pondweed}} {{is within the}} Section Graminifolii (fine-leaved pondweeds). It {{is closely related to}} P. compressus, P. zosterifolius and P. mandschuriensis, all of which also have sclerenchymatous strands.|$|E
50|$|Astragalus acmophylloides, the <b>sharp-leaved</b> milkvetch, is {{a species}} of milkvetch that is endemic to Erzurum and Artvin provinces. in Turkey. It {{can be found at}} pine forest edges at about 1,700 m elevation. It is {{threatened}} by dam construction and overgrazing.|$|E
50|$|Solidago arguta, {{commonly}} called Atlantic goldenrod, cut-leaf goldenrod, forest goldenrod, toothed goldenrod, and <b>sharp-leaved</b> goldenrod, is {{a species of}} flowering plant native to eastern and central North America. It grows along the Gulf and Atlantic states of the United States from Texas to Maine, inland as far as Ontario, Illinois, and Kansas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sharp-leaved</b> {{pondweed}} grows {{annually from}} turions and seed, producing rather lax plants branching {{near the surface}} with strongly compressed stems and long, rather grass-like leaves that are 35-100 mm long and 1.5-5 mm wide and dark green, often with a marked reddish or brownish tinge. Each leaf has one vein {{either side of the}} midrib. There are no rhizomes or floating leaves.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sharp-leaved</b> {{pondweed}} {{has declined}} markedly in both Britain and Denmark. On the British and Swiss Red Lists for Vascular Plants it {{is listed as}} Critically Endangered {{and it is a}} UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species. It is classed as Vulnerable in the Czech Republic and Germany. In Flanders it is classed as Rare and in the Netherlands it is Near Threatened.|$|E
50|$|Within its range, <b>sharp-leaved</b> {{pondweed}} {{is relatively}} easily identified {{from all other}} pondweeds except the closely related grass-wrack pondweed (P. compressus) by its combination of strongly flattened stems, sclerenchymatous strands in the leaf (giving the submerged leaves an opaque appearance compared with the transparent appearance of other pondweeds) and leaves with sharply pointed (acute) tips. Grass-wrack pondweed differs in having blunter tips to the leaves, leaves with 2 veins {{either side of the}} midrib, and infloresecences with 10-20 flowers on long peduncles, 28-95 mm long.|$|E
50|$|In Britain, P. acutifolius {{is almost}} {{exclusively}} restricted to shallow, circumneutral, species-rich ditches on lowland grazing marshes, often with fairly high conductivity. Although {{there are some}} fairly strong populations remaining in Britain, these are vulnerable to changes in farming practice, pollution and sea level rise. As ditch systems are an artificial habitat type, <b>sharp-leaved</b> pondweed presumably relied on a now destroyed habitat in Britain, a possible candidate being natural lowland river-floodplain wetland areas, which could create disturbed areas for this plant to exploit. Alternatively, {{it may have been}} associated with a now extinct species such as beaver.|$|E
50|$|Kickxia elatine is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the Plantaginaceae known by several common names, including sharpleaf cancerwort and <b>sharp-leaved</b> fluellen. It is native to Europe and Asia, but it is present on other continents as an introduced species, and sometimes a noxious weed. This is a small hairy herb with a trailing stem with many branches. It produces oval to arrowhead-shaped fuzzy leaves at wide intervals along the slender stem, and solitary snapdragon-like flowers borne on long, straight pedicels. Each flower is up to 1.5 centimeters long with a narrow, pointed spur extending from the back. The lobes of the mouth are yellow, white, and purple, and the whole flower is fuzzy to hairy. The fruit is a spherical capsule about 4 millimeters long.|$|E
