6000|$|THERE grew a {{fragrant}} rose-tree {{where the}} brook flows, [...] With two little tender buds, and one full rose; [...] When {{the sun went}} down to his bed in the west, [...] The little buds leaned on the rose-mother's breast, [...] While the bright eyed stars their long watch kept, [...] And the flowers of the valley in their green cradles slept; [...] Then silently in odors they communed with each other, [...] The two little buds on the bosom of their mother. [...] "O sister," [...] said the little one, as she gazed at the sky, [...] "I wish that the Dew Elves, as they wander lightly by, [...] Would bring me a star; for they never grow dim, [...] And the Father does not need them to burn round him. [...] The shining drops of dew the Elves bring each day [...] And place in my bosom, so soon pass away; [...] But a star would glitter brightly through the long summer hours, [...] And I should be fairer than all my sister flowers. [...] That were better far than the dew-drops that fall [...] On the high and the low, and come alike to all. [...] I would be fair and stately, with a bright star to shine [...] And give a queenly air to this crimson robe of mine." [...] And proudly she cried, [...] "These fire-flies shall be [...] My jewels, since the stars can never come to me." [...] Just then a tiny dew-drop that hung o'er the dell [...] On the breast of the bud like a <b>soft</b> <b>star</b> fell; [...] But impatiently she flung it away from her leaf, [...] And it fell on her mother like a tear of grief, [...] While she folded to her breast, with wilful pride, [...] A glittering fire-fly that hung by her side. [...] "Heed," [...] said the mother rose, [...] "daughter mine, [...] Why shouldst thou seek for beauty not thine? [...] The Father hath made thee what thou now art; [...] And what he most loveth is a sweet, pure heart. [...] Then why dost thou take with such discontent [...] The loving gift which he to thee hath sent? [...] For the cool fresh dew will render thee far [...] More lovely and sweet than the brightest star; [...] They were made for Heaven, and can never come to shine [...] Like the fire-fly thou hast in that foolish breast of thine. [...] O my foolish little bud, do listen to thy mother; [...] Care only for true beauty, and seek for no other. [...] There will be grief and trouble in that wilful little heart; [...] Unfold thy leaves, my daughter, and let the fly depart." [...] But the proud little bud would have her own will, [...] And folded the fire-fly more closely still; [...] Till the struggling insect tore open the vest [...] Of purple and green, that covered her breast. [...] When the sun came up, she saw with grief [...] The blooming of her sister bud leaf by leaf. [...] While she, once as fair and bright as the rest, [...] Hung her weary head down on her wounded breast. [...] Bright grew the sunshine, and the soft summer air [...] Was filled with the music of flowers singing there; [...] But faint grew the little bud with thirst and pain, [...] And longed for the cool dew; but now 't was in vain. [...] Then bitterly she wept for her folly and pride, [...] As drooping she stood by her fair sister's side. [...] Then the rose mother leaned the weary little head [...] On her bosom to rest, and tenderly she said: [...] "Thou hast learned, my little bud, that, whatever may betide, [...] Thou canst win thyself no joy by passion or by pride. [...] The loving Father sends the sunshine and the shower, [...] That thou mayst become a perfect little flower;-- [...] The sweet dews to feed thee, the soft wind to cheer, [...] And the earth as a pleasant home, while thou art dwelling here. [...] Then shouldst thou not be grateful for all this kindly care, [...] And strive to keep thyself most innocent and fair? [...] Then seek, my little blossom, to win humility; [...] Be fair without, be pure within, and thou wilt happy be. [...] So when the quiet Autumn of thy fragrant life shall come, [...] Thou mayst pass away, to bloom in the Flower Spirits' home." [...] Then from the mother's breast, where it still lay hid, [...] Into the fading bud the dew-drop gently slid; [...] Stronger grew the little form, and happy tears fell, [...] As the dew did its silent work, and the bud grew well, [...] While the gentle rose leaned, with motherly pride, [...] O'er the fair little ones that bloomed at her side.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to research, design and build a shoe press for a local company called <b>Soft</b> <b>Star</b> Shoes. <b>Soft</b> <b>Star</b> Shoes were looking for {{different}} ways to replace their barging process, which {{is the process of}} attaching the rubber sole of the shoe to the upper leather. To perform this process, <b>Soft</b> <b>Star</b> Shoes used hammering, which was physically straining, caused operators to get frustrated, as well as, slowed the production process. After receiving the problem description and customer requirements, a decision to go with an automated press was made. The team researched existing shoe presses to use as benchmarks in the design process. The team then performed ergonomic analysis to understand the severity of the problem, and stress-strain and reliability analyses to find maximum loads, and fracturing points. In addition, the team interviewed <b>Soft</b> <b>Star</b> Shoes barge employees to determine the requirements that needed to be met for the press to be considered a good replacement for the hammering process. Using this information, the team designed and built a shoe press that meets the customer’s needs. The new device is a 17 ” by 17 ” by 12 ” press that is held by five vertical columns. These columns are attached to two 0. 5 ” thick steel plates (one on the top and one on the bottom). The press is powered using a 115 V ball screw device, which is inserted {{through a hole in the}} top steel plate, and carries a 14 ” x 14 ” x 0. 5 ” pressing plate. The device travels a vertical distance of 10 ” to perform the pressing process. Tests were started upon finishing the design process. The tests were conducted based on the engineering requirements generated. The press passed all these tests, which meant that the team has achieved the sponsor’s needs. However, the project was not done at that point. The press was dirty and the steel was rusted. So cosmetic operations were performed. Cleaning, Painting and adding lights to the press were a critical factor in delivering a good-looking press. After completing the cosmetics, the press was delivered to the sponsoring company. Furthermore, the press had a big impact on <b>Soft</b> <b>Star</b> Shoes’ production floor. It allowed the company to replace the existing barging process, which improved their ergonomic rating, as well as, their shoe output. Operators did not need to apply any physical force to barge the shoes, which reduced the chances of musculoskeletal disorders within the company’s walls. In addition, the new press barged a pair of shoes in 4 minutes and 5 seconds, which meant more than a 60...|$|E

The {{aim of the}} present study was to compare the effect of two incremental com-posite placement and two light curing methods on microleakage of composite class one resto-rations. Materials & Methods: In this experimental study 60 maxillary premolars after class one prepa-ration were assigned to 4 different groups according to light curing method (soft or full power) and two incremental methods (horizontal or oblique) 1. Horizontal incremental placement with full power cure 2. Horizontal incremental placement with <b>soft</b> <b>star</b> cure 3. Oblique incremental placement with full power cure and 4. Oblique incremental placement with soft start cure. After etching and bonding, teeth were restored with Tetric Ceram HB composite. Samples were thermocycled and immersed in 0. 2 % fuchsin solution for 48 hours. Samples were sectioned buccolingually and evaluated under stereomicroscope (40 ×). Micro-leakage was scored as follow; 0 : No microleakage, 1 : Microleakage till enamel edge, 2 : Microleakage between dentin edge and floor of the cavity and 3 :Microleakage extended to the floor of cavity or pulp. Data was analyzed by SPSS software version 16 using Kruscal Wallis and Mann Whitney U test at the significant level of 0. 05. Results: There was a significant difference between four experimental groups, micro leakage (P= 0. 000). The mean micro leakage of group 1 was significantly different from groups 2, 3 and 4 (P 0. 05). Conclusion: Restorative material placement technique and curing mode was effective on the microleakage of class 1 composite restoration, however, curing mode was more effective on reduced composite microleakage compared to the placement technique.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{significance of}} tidal deformation in astronomical systems {{has long been}} known. The recently discovered universal I-Love-Q relations, which connect moment of inertia, quadrupole tidal Love number, and spin-induced quadrupole moment of compact stars, also underscore the special role of tidal deformation in gravitational wave astronomy. Motivated by the observation that such relations also prevail in Newtonian stars and crucially depend on the stiffness of a star, we consider the tidal Love numbers of Newtonian polytropic stars whose stiffness is characterised by a polytropic index n. We first perturbatively solve the Lane-Emden equation governing the profile of polytropic stars {{through the application of}} the scaled delta expansion method and then formulate perturbation series for the multipolar tidal Love number about the two exactly solvable cases with n= 0 and n= 1, respectively. Making use of these two series to form a two-point Padé approximant, we find an approximate expression of the quadrupole tidal Love number, whose error is less than 2. 5 × 10 ^- 5 per cent (0. 39 per cent) for n∈[0, 1] (n∈[0, 3]). Similarly, we also determine the mass moments for polytropic stars accurately. Based on these findings, we are able to show that the I-Love-Q relations are in general stationary about the incompressible limit irrespective of the equation of state (EOS) of a star. Moreover, for the I-Love-Q relations, there is a secondary stationary point near n ≈ 0. 4444, thus showing the insensitivity to n for n∈[0, 1]. Our investigation clearly tracks the universality of the I-Love-Q relations from their validity for stiff stars such as neutron stars to their breakdown for <b>soft</b> <b>stars.</b> Comment: 17 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables To appear in MNRA...|$|R
