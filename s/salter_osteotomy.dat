40|$|Background: Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) {{consists}} of either subluxation or dislocation of femoral head from acetabulum and acetabular dysplasia. The ratio of left side hip to right is 3 : 1. There are {{several kinds of}} treatments for DDH globally, and conservative treatment {{is one of the}} best methods with a better outcome than surgical treatment. Objective: The aim of this research study is to compare the outcomes of Open Reduction versus Open Reduction <b>Salter</b> <b>Osteotomy</b> with regard to length of stay, complications and family satisfaction among children with DDH at FMIC, Kabul, Afghanistan. Methodology: A retrospective cohort study design was employed. Records of 166 participants who underwent Open Reduction and Open reduction <b>Salter</b> <b>Osteotomy</b> at FMIC hospital were reviewed. The data was collected from the available records during the period of 2010 to 2015. Chi-square test of independence and T-test for two independent samples were run to determine an association between two categorical variables and compute mean difference between categorical and continuous variables for two types of surgical procedure for DDH respectively. In addition, t-test for two dependent samples was also run to compare the mean difference of Pre-operation and Post-operation AI. All the ethical principles were followed throughout the study process. Result: The research findings revealed that there is a difference in outcomes of Open Reduction versus Open Reduction <b>Salter</b> <b>Osteotomy.</b> There was a meaningful difference of Pre-operation and Post-Operation AI for DDH patients (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 001).

40|$|Background: The {{principles}} of treatment of congenital dislocation of hip in old children {{are different than}} those of infants and neonates. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the radiographic and functional results of one-stage treatment (open reduction, femoral shortening derotation, and <b>Salter′s</b> <b>osteotomy)</b> of DDH in older children. Materials and Methods: Between January 2005 and June 2010, 25 patients (30 hips) underwent one-stage triple procedure of open reduction, femoral shortening derotation, and <b>Salter′s</b> <b>osteotomy</b> for the treatment of DDH. Preoperatively, they were classified according to the Tφnnis class. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the modified McKay′s criteria to measure pain symptoms, gait pattern, Trendelenburg sign status, and the range of hip joint movement. Radiographic assessment was made using Severin′s scoring method to measure the centre-edge angle and dysplasia. Results: The mean age at the time of operation was 3. 9 years (range 1. 6 - 8 years), and the average duration of followup was 4. 1 years (range 2 - 7. 6 years). The McKay′s score was excellent in 13 hips, good in 14 hips, fair in 2, and poor in 1 hip.

MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, 47 individuals with LCPD who were treated using <b>Salter</b> <b>osteotomy</b> (1984 – 2004) were evaluated. The patients were evaluated according to sex, skin color, side affected and age at which osteotomy was performed. The preoperative radiographs were analyzed in accordance with the classifications of Waldenström, Catterall, Laredo and Herring. The radiographs obtained at the time of skeletal maturity were classified using the Stulberg method. ResultsThe mean age at the time of surgical treatment was 82. 87 months (6. 9 years). The age presented a statistically significant correlation with the Stulberg grades at skeletal maturity (p< 0. 001). Patients over the age of 6. 12 years tended to present less favorable results. The variables of sex, skin color and side affected did not present any statistically significant correlation with the prognosis (p= 0. 425; p= 0. 467; p= 0. 551, respectively).

At the time of surgery, mean age of the patients was 22. 4 months (11 - 60). Forty-four of the patients were unilateral and 6 of them were bilateral. After routine preparations standard <b>Salter</b> Innominate <b>Osteotomy</b> was performed without preoperative traction. Adductor and iliopsoas tenotomy were added if it was needed at the intraoperative evaluation. Femoral derotation or shortening were not performed. Postoperatively pelvipedal cast was applied for 45 days and hip abduction brace (Dennis-Brown type) was worn for another 45 days. All of the patients were evaluted after a mean of 21. 6 months (7 - 44) follow-up. The modified Mac Kay criteria were used for the clinical and Severin’s criteria was used for radiological evaluation, and the Kalamchi - MacEwen classification was used for the assessment of the developed avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Results: The mean follow up of the patients was 21. 6 months (7 - 44). Of the 56 hips who were operated, 51 of them (91. 1 %) were group I (very good), 4 of them (7. 1 %) were group II (good), 1 of them (1. 8 %) was group III (average) clinically.

40|$|Femoral head incongruency at {{skeletal}} maturity {{is associated}} with the development of osteoarthritis in early adulthood. Containment of the femoral head provides a larger surface area for remodelling of the collapsed femoral head and the development of spherical congruency. Triple pelvic osteotomy has a role to play in Legg-Calve-Perthes' disease by improving femoral head containment and preventing subluxation. This is traditionally a two-incision approach with significant associated morbidity. In our unit we perform triple osteotomies through a single anterolateral incision. To retrospectively review the clinical and radiographic outcome of children who had triple osteotomies performed through a single incision over a 4 -year period. In our unit from 2003 to 2006 we performed eight triple osteotomies through a single incision in children aged between 6 and 12 years with Legg-Calve-Perthes' disease. The procedure was performed through a single anterolateral incision made beneath the middle of the iliac crest and carried forward according to <b>Salter's</b> <b>osteotomy.</b> Image intensification was used to confirm iliac, pubic and ischial cuts. After performing a standard <b>Salter's</b> <b>osteotomy</b> the acetabular fragment was free to rotate anteriorly and laterally. None of the children were casted and all were allowed immediate mobilization nonweight bearing with crutches for 6 weeks. Clinical results and hip function were measured preoperatively and postoperatively using the modified Harris hip score. The average length of hospital stay was 4. 7 days. None of the children had a nonunion. The centre edge angle of Wiberg was measured on all preoperative and postoperative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs. In all our patients there was an improvement in the centre edge angle of Wiberg and in the modified Harris hip score. The preoperative modified Harris hip scores ranged from 38 to 60 and postoperatively ranged from 77 to 92. The preoperative centre edge angle of Wiberg ranged from 9 to 24 whereas postoperative scores ranged from 25 to 46. Triple osteotomy has been advocated in Legg-Calve-Perthes' disease after the closure of the triradiate cartilage. Using a single incision is a safer alternative to the traditional two-incision approach. We believe that the single incision approach reduces operative time and potential morbidity associated with the steel triple osteotomy with comparable clinical and radiographic outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Insufficient femoral head {{coverage}} {{is found in}} a variety of diseases, with acetabular dysplasia as the most frequent disorder and triple pelvic osteotomy as the most recently introduced surgical treatment. Objective. This study analyses pre- and postoperative pathoanatomic characteristics of triple in comparison to Salter and Chiari osteotomies, with a logistic regression analysis of outcome predictor and effect explanator factors in relation to the chosen type of operation. Methods. The study involved 136 adolescents treated with Salter and Chiari osteotomies or a triple pelvic osteotomy at the Institute of Orthopaedic Surgery 'Banjica' in Belgrade. The patients were between 10 - 20 {{years old at the time}} of operation. We collected and analyzed data from all the patients: illness history, operative parameters, preoperative and postoperative pathoanatomic data. The data was statistically processed using the statistical software SPSS, defining standard descriptive values, and by using the appropriate tests of analytic statistics: t-test for dependent and independent variables, χ 2 -test, Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon's test, parameter correlation, one-way ANOVA, multi-factorial ANOVA and logistic regression, according to the type of the analyzed data and the conditions under which the statistical methods were applied. Results. The average CE angle after triple pelvic osteotomy was 43. 5 °, more improved than after the <b>Salter</b> <b>osteotomy</b> (33. 0 °) and Chiari osteotomy (31. 4 °) (F= 16. 822; p< 0. 01). Postoperative spherical congruence was also more frequent after the triple osteotomy than after the other two types of operations, and with a high significance. Preoperative painful discomfort was found to be a valid predictor of indications for the triple osteotomy over both Chiari and Salter osteotomies. The valid explanators of effect for the triple osteotomy are: postoperative joint congruence (compared to the Chiari osteotomy) and increase in joint coverage (compared to <b>Salter</b> <b>osteotomy).</b> Conclusion.

40|$|Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease {{represents}} avascular necrosis of the femoral head in {{a growing}} child. It commonly affects children aged 2 - 14 years, mostly boys, and has familiar pattern. The etiology of this disease is unknown. It is based on avascular necrosis due to variations of the femoral head vascular supply, trauma, coagulation of endocrine disturbances. The disease presents with limping and pain localized in the hip with projection to thigh and knee, frequently accompanied by the limitation of abduction and internal rotation, as well as slight limitation in flexion of about 20 degrees. Plain radiography is most informative additional diagnostic procedure, enabling assessment of the stage of disease, containment of the femoral head within the acetabulum, acetabular coverage {{and the extent of}} disease. Main treatment goal is obtaining the spherical congruity of the hip joint. This can be achieved by abduction bracing, varization femoral osteotomies and various innominate osteotomies (sometimes combined with femoral osteotomies). Children younger than four years of age, with minimal femoral head involvement, do not need any treatment.

30|$|Although shelf acetabuloplasty {{leads to}} {{improved}} femoral head coverage, the available literature {{does not support}} the use of this procedure to prevent late osteoarthritis and improve function long term [17]. Recently, a new labral support technique has been reported. This shelf arthroplasty technique includes a minimal-incision variant of labral support shelf arthroplasty, arthroscopic visualization, and an allograft buttress on the shelf support that has been proposed to maintain containment. This minimal-incision technique yielded similar results to those obtained using a Petrie cast, a femoral varus osteotomy, or an innominate (<b>Salter)</b> <b>osteotomy.</b> The authors concluded that the labral support shelf arthroplasty technique is simple to perform and does not induce a permanent deformity in the proximal femur or acetabulum [6]. An advantage compared to femoral varus osteotomy is that there is additional lateral growth of the true acetabulum to generate more coverage following surgery. In this way, the labral support technique can stimulate lateral acetabular growth, restore the shelf after femoral epiphyseal reossification, and prevent subluxation [10].|$|E

30|$|Rather than <b>Salter’s</b> <b>osteotomy,</b> {{the author}} of the present study {{preferred}} proximal femoral varus osteotomy because this method achieves decompression, enables dynamic treatment, does not increase intra-articular pressure, and does not cause a frozen joint postoperatively with good coverage of the femoral head in the hip joint [3, 12, 15, 30, 37]. It is also worth noting that femoral varus osteotomy is said to have certain disadvantages or complications, such as femoral shortening, limping, excessive varus, nonunion, and overgrowth and elevation of the greater trochanter [3, 12, 15, 30, 37]. The most important predictor of leg length discrepancy (LLD) is the extent of lateral pillar involvement, and no other factor (including age, sex, and treatment modality) is correlated with LLD at skeletal maturity [32]. In the present study, the author decided to use an open-wedge osteotomy, as persistent limb shortening tends to be greater after a closed-wedge osteotomy in the older child. We did not see any progressive change in this parameter during the follow-up period, especially after hardware removal and in the younger boys, but it may decrease with time as the varus angulation of the subtrochanteric osteotomy gradually changes.|$|R
30|$|Proponents of the <b>Salter</b> innominate <b>osteotomy</b> cite {{improved}} anterolateral {{coverage of}} the femoral head [16, 20].

Shelf procedures (augmentation arthroplasty) are touted as a less invasive approach [18]. Nevertheless, the abductors have to be stripped in order to properly position and secure the bone graft. Furthermore, {{the long-term effects of}} covering over the labrum are unknown, and the risk of creating an anterolateral pincer-type impingement makes this a less attractive option.|$|R

Acetabular over-coverage should be avoided in pelvic osteotomy to prevent the development of femoroacetabular impingement. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Objectives:To {{evaluate}} the radiographic results from patients with bilateral developmental dysplasia {{of the hip}} (DDH) who underwent surgical treatment by means of open reduction and <b>Salter</b> <b>osteotomy,</b> with or without associated femoral shortening as described by Ombrédanne. Methods:This was a retrospective descriptive study in which 21 patients with bilateral DDH (42 hips) were analyzed. They were treated at Hospital Infantil Joana de Gusmão (HIJG), with operations between August 1997 and October 2009. To {{evaluate the}} radiographic results, the acetabular index and the Wiberg center-edge angle were measured, and the Severin and Kalamchi&# 8211;MacEwen classifications were used. Descriptive and parametric statistical analyses were {{used to evaluate the}} data. Results:We did not observe any statistically significant difference in analyzing the radio-graphic parameters, making comparisons regarding the side affected, the order of the procedures and whether femoral shortening was performed, although {{there was a significant difference}} between them from before to after the operation. Conclusion:Open reduction in association with iliac osteotomy as described by Salter presented significant improvements in the radiographic parameters analyzed, comparing the pre- and postoperative values. This improvement occurred independently of whether Ombrédanne femoral shortening was performed. The most prevalent complication in the study group was avascular necrosis of the femoral head...|$|E
40|$|Legg-Calv,-Perthes (LCP) {{disease is}} {{currently}} managed by mechanical containment of the femoral {{head in the}} hip socket. As evidence suggests that hip distraction may offer a new treatment strategy, we used arthrodistraction as a primary treatment for active forms of LCP disease and prospectively compared the results with the <b>Salter</b> innominate <b>osteotomy.</b> A total of 54 children, six years or older of both genders with severe forms of LCP disease in the stages of necrosis or revascularisation, were enrolled. Patients were submitted to either <b>Salter</b> innominate <b>osteotomy</b> (n = 28) or hip arthrodistraction (n = 26). Final radiographs were {{used to evaluate the}} Mose index, Wiberg angle, extrusion index and the Stulberg et al. classification. There {{were no significant differences in}} gender, age, lateral pillar classification and average follow-up time between the two groups. The osteotomy group progressed without major complications, but children in the joint distraction group experienced episodes of pin tract pain and infection, leading to the early removal of the external device in one case. Two patients developed joint stiffness, treated by physiotherapy or manipulation, and one child developed subluxation of the femoral head. The average time in distraction was 4. 44 months (2. 53 - 7. 23 months). In the final evaluation the osteotomy group showed better containment of the femoral head. The Mose index and the Stulberg et al. classification were statistically similar between the two groups. Despite similar final radiological results, arthrodistraction was associated with a higher morbidity. Consequently, we do not recommend hip distraction as a primary treatment for the early stages of LCP disease...|$|R
30|$|Of 55 hips treated, type- 1 {{temporary}} AVN {{was found}} in two patients (3.6  %); these lesions had disappeared completely from the last check-up graphs of these patients.

30|$|Different pelvic osteotomies {{have been}} {{described}} in to correct the acetabulum dysplasia. Innominate <b>Salter</b> <b>osteotomy</b> and triple osteotomy have given unsatisfactory results {{for the treatment of}} spastic subluxation of the hip [18, 19]. Pelvic innominate osteotomy increases the anterolateral coverage of the femoral head and decreases the posterior coverage, which was the reason why Salter et al. [19] advised against its use in neurologic hip subluxation. The literature remains controversial regarding the analysis of the acetabular deficiency. Zimmermann and Sturm [20] and Gugenheim et al. [21] reported the acetabulum deficiency to be anterior on 2 -dimensional CT, whereas Buckley et al. [22] reported it to be posterior on 2 -dimensional CT. Recently, Chang et al. [23] used 3 D CT and confirmed that the acetabulum deficiency was more anterior. The acetabulum of CP patients with hip subluxation or dislocation is usually ovoid and elongated [4]. For all these reasons, the Dega modified acetabuloplasty seems to be the most appropriate osteotomy. This procedure allows a global femoral head coverage that can be adjusted intraoperatively by the position of the bone graft. The main advantage is the posterior correction obtained, without sacrificing the anterior coverage. Results of our study confirm that Dega pelvic osteotomy is not only efficient, but also stable over time, since the AA remained unchanged after nine years of follow-up.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{objectives}} of pelvic osteotomies are to improve femoral head coverage and coxofemoral joint stability. The most currently used osteotomies {{can be divided}} into reorientation osteotomies (Salter and Pol le Cœur triple osteotomy) and acetabuloplasties (Pemberton and Dega). All these osteotomies share an identical installation on the table and bikini-type incision. The <b>Salter</b> <b>osteotomy</b> uses a single osteotomy line located at the inferior gluteal line. The Pol Le Cœur triple pelvic osteotomy combines innominate osteotomies of the iliopubic and ischiopubic rami via a genitofemoral approach (inguinal). In these two reorientation osteotomies, the acetabulum tilts in retroversion, improving the anterior and lateral coverage but reducing the posterior coverage. In the Pemberton acetabuloplasty, the osteotomy line is incomplete. It begins anteriorly between the iliac spines and ends posteriorly immediately above the triradiate cartilage. The posterior part of the ilium remains intact. The Pemberton acetabuloplasty causes retroversion and plicature of the acetabulum responsible for reducing its diameter. Anterior and lateral coverage of the femoral head is improved and posterior coverage remains unchanged. In the Dega acetabuloplasty, the osteotomy line is incomplete. It begins laterally above the acetabulum and terminates just above the triradiate cartilage. The medial part of the ilium remains intact. The Dega acetabuloplasty reduces the diameter of the acetabulum and improves overall femoral head coverage (anterior, lateral, and posterior) ...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. Arthrogryposis {{multiplex}} congenita (AMC) {{is a rare}} syndrome {{with multiple}} joint contractures. It is commonly believed that bilaterally dislocated hips associated with joint contractures should not be reduced, because movement is satisfactory, while open reduction leads to poor results. This report presents our experience with surgical management of bilateral dislocation of hips in children with AMC. METHODS. During the period 1990 to 2000, we performed open reduction on 8 hips of 4 children with AMC. The mean age at surgery was 23 months (range, 5 - 48 months). Open reduction and capsular plication without any bony procedure were performed in 4 hips (2 patients). De-rotation and varus osteotomy of the femur was performed in 4 hips, and <b>Salter</b> <b>osteotomy</b> of the innominate bone in 2 hips. The average acetabular index was 44 degrees, and the mean centreedge angle was - 41 degrees preoperatively. RESULTS. The average follow-up period was 4 years (range, 2 - 9 years). The average acetabular index and centre-edge angle were 19 and 18 degrees, respectively {{at the time of}} last follow-up. All children could walk without support. One child required re-opening for redislocation of hip joint. The clinical results were good in 6 hips and fair in 2 hips, according to Severin's and McKay's classifications. CONCLUSION. Our experience shows that open reduction for bilateral dislocation of hips in children with AMC is a suitable option with generally good results. Surgery performed at earlier age gives the best functional outcome...|$|E
30|$|One of the {{surgical}} methods used when other treatment options are contraindicated is arthrodiastasis {{of the hip}} joint with soft-tissue release. The advantages of this procedure are that it improves the range of motion, reduces superior and lateral subluxation, and provides better radiographic sphericity of the femoral head. This treatment can even be performed with distraction in stiff hips and deformed hips [1, 2, 21, 27]. In a comparative study by Voplon in which he used arthrodistraction as a primary treatment for active forms of LCP disease and prospectively compared the results with those obtained using <b>Salter</b> innominate <b>osteotomy,</b> although the methods gave similar final radiological results, morbidity was higher with arthrodistraction than with innominate osteotomy. Consequently, the author does not recommend arthrodistraction as a primary treatment for {{the early stages of}} Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease [39].|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 38 {{children}} (49 hips) were retrospectively investigated {{to assess the}} efficacy and safety of one-stage treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in untreated children from {{two to five years}} of age. Our method consisted of open reduction, <b>Salter</b> innominate <b>osteotomy,</b> femoral shortening and dero-tation osteotomy. The patients were distributed into two groups according to the age at which they were operated: Group I included 19 patients aged < 3 years (24 hips) and Group II included 19 patients aged ≥ 3 years (25 hips). Mean follow-up was 5. 08 years for Group I and 5. 76 years for group II. Clinical and radiological assessment at final follow-up showed that the outcome was not significantly different between the two groups. Furthermore, after this follow-up period, the rates of avascular necrosis were similar. Children with DDH between two and five years of age were treated successfully with one-stage treatment...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study aims {{to compare}} the pelvic {{biomechanics}} of patients who underwent <b>Salter</b> innominate <b>osteotomy</b> (SIO) for one hip and Pemberton pericapsular osteotomy (PPO) for the other hip. Materials and Methods: Fifty-seven of 126 patients who received a one-stage procedure involving SIO for one hip and PPO for the other hip were included in this series. Preoperative x-rays, archived reports and patient recall were obtained and retrospectively analyzed for these 57 patients. Pelvic biomechanics of the two osteotomy techniques were compared on x-rays and computerized tomography imaging. Results: Based on x-rays, three hips with SIO and 1 hip with PPO had changes that could reflect unstable pelvic biomechanics. SIO caused an average lower limb discrepancy of 0. 47 cm in all patients. Positive results were found in 5 patients at their most recent clinical examination. Conclusion: PPO affects the biomechanics of the pelvis much less than SIO. PPO demonstrated ideal biomechanical results compared with SIO, with fewer changes to the pelvic ring and the hip joints...|$|R
