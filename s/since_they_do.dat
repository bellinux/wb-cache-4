5|$|The {{traditional}} rival of the Oregon Ducks is the Oregon State Beavers, {{called the}} Civil War. This fierce rivalry {{extended to the}} track and field programs, where for a period, they met twice a year. However, due to budgetary concerns, Oregon State University dropped the track and field program in 1988 and the rivalry ended. Their women's program was reinstated in 2004, but <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have a men's program, the rivalry {{has not yet been}} renewed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} (Manhattan- and Queens-bound) {{end of the}} upper level, the Culver Line local tracks diverge, {{splitting}} into four tracks. The F train, using the outer pair of tracks, ramps down to the lower level, merges with the innermost, express tracks located on the lower level, and continues north to Jay Street–MetroTech. Meanwhile, the G train, using the inner pair of tracks, stays on the upper level before making a hard right turn east under Schermerhorn Street to Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. The lower level tracks can only be reached by trains running to or from Jay Street–MetroTech <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not connect to the IND Crosstown Line.|$|E
5|$|Giraffes were {{probably}} common targets for hunters throughout Africa. Different {{parts of their}} bodies were used for different purposes. Their meat was used for food. The tail hairs served as flyswatters, bracelets, necklaces and thread. Shields, sandals and drums were made using the skin, and the strings of musical instruments were from the tendons. The smoke from burning giraffe skins {{was used by the}} medicine men of Buganda to treat nose bleeds. The Humr people of Sudan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh; which is created from the liver and marrow of giraffes. Umm Nyolokh often contains DMT and other psychoactive substances from plants the giraffes eat such as Acacia; and is known to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed to be the giraffes' ghosts by the Humr. In the 19th century, European explorers began to hunt them for sport. Habitat destruction has hurt the giraffe, too: in the Sahel, the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to deforestation. Normally, giraffes can coexist with livestock, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not directly compete with them.|$|E

25|$|De la Gardie {{himself was}} {{responsible}} for parts of the financial troubles Sweden faced at the time, created by Johan Palmstruch and his paper money. He made several donations from the Crown to himself and used national resources for private matters. Meanwhile, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not receive the funds necessary for maintenance, the navy went into decline, and soldiers died or ran away from the army <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not receive their pay.|$|R

5|$|Restoration {{of most of}} {{the canal}} does not present major problems, but {{challenges}} are presented by the final sections at both ends. The original route to join the Trent has been severed by the building of the A52 road. A route was identified which followed the course of the Polser Brook, which passes under the A52 {{to the north of the}} canal, but by 2009, three possible solutions were under consideration. These pose additional problems in finding funding, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not count as restoration, and many of the traditional funding sources are not then available. At Grantham, an embankment carrying the A1 road blocks the line of the canal, and the terminal basin has been filled in. There are plans for a tunnel under the A1 as part of a cycle route to improve access to Grantham, and the basin could be redeveloped in due course.|$|E
25|$|The {{two types}} {{are not easily}} exchangeable, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{not have the same}} pinout, and the command sets are incompatible.|$|E

50|$|It {{explains}} that primitive pouncers (perhaps like Microraptor) could coexist with more advanced fliers (like Confuciusornis or Sapeornis) <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not compete for flying niches.|$|R

25|$|Patients with Marfan-progeroid-lipodystrophy {{syndrome}} typically exhibit congenital lipodystrophy and a neonatal progeroid appearance. Sometimes {{identified as}} having neonatal progeroid syndrome, the term is a misnomer <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not exhibit accelerated aging. The condition is caused by mutations near the 3'-terminus of the FBN1 gene.|$|E
25|$|Coronal {{holes are}} the Polar Regions which look {{dark in the}} X-rays <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not emit much radiation. These are wide zones of the Sun where the {{magnetic}} field is unipolar and opens towards the interplanetary space. The high speed solar wind arises mainly from these regions.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{citizens}} who are permanent residents of Hong Kong but less than 11 years old are not also eligible for this passport <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not hold a permanent ID. Such persons may be issued Hong Kong Re-entry Permit in lieu of HKSAR passport. After they obtain a permanent ID, they may be issued HKSAR passport, however.|$|E

25|$|D. arctica are {{not well}} known. These common wasps rely on new nests to rear {{offspring}} <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have their own worker caste. The parasite kills the foundress queen before the production of her workers is complete and takes over the nest. The lifespan of the parasite after the host queen's death is limited.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{the means}} {{available}} to the rabbinic courts to force husbands to grant their wives a get. In Israel, rabbinic courts can even imprison a husband until he acquiesces and grants a get to his wife. This is not, however, an option for rabbinic courts elsewhere, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not {{have the support of}} the state.|$|E
25|$|According to The Heritage Foundation, {{the federal}} poverty line also {{excludes}} income other than cash income, especially welfare benefits. Thus, if food stamps and public housing were successfully raising {{the standard of living}} for poverty stricken individuals, then the poverty line figures would not shift, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not consider the income equivalents of such entitlements.|$|E
50|$|Andhras were {{mentioned}} in the Aitareya Brahmana (VII.18). They are referred to along with the Pudras, Shabaras, Pulindas and the Mulibas as outcasts <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not identify their father’s adoption of Shunahshepa.|$|R

50|$|After the battle, Rozycki {{and his men}} {{waited for}} two more days, hoping that the promised Galician {{reinforcements}} would join them. <b>Since</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not arrive, the insurgents decided to enter Austrian territory, where their unit was dissolved.|$|R
25|$|From {{commissioning}} to 1978, Point Franklin was {{commanded by}} enlisted chief petty officers, which are termed officers-in-charge <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not hold a commission. In 1978, junior officers with {{the rank of}} lieutenant, junior grade were made commanding officers. From 1992 to decommissioning the responsibility of command reverted to officers-in-charge with the rank of master chief petty officer.|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} {{solution to this}} anchor point placement problem is to remove the histogram binning grid completely. In the left figure below, a kernel (represented by the grey lines) is centred {{at each of the}} 50 data points above. The result of summing these kernels is given on the right figure, which is a kernel density estimate. The most striking difference between kernel density estimates and histograms is that the former are easier to interpret <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not contain artifices induced by a binning grid.|$|E
25|$|Āstika and nāstika are {{variously}} {{defined terms}} sometimes used to categorise Indian religions. The traditional definition, followed by Adi Shankara, classifies religions and persons as āstika and nāstika {{according to whether}} they accept {{the authority of the}} main Hindu texts, the Vedas, as supreme revealed scriptures, or not. By this definition, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Purva Mimamsa and Vedanta are classified as āstika schools, while Charvaka is classified as a nāstika school. Buddhism and Jainism are also thus classified as nāstika religions <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not accept the authority of the Vedas.|$|E
50|$|From {{the reign}} of Charlemagne (r. 768-814), the court of the Frankish king/emperor had {{clerical}} members styled apocrisiarii. However, they were only royal archchaplains decorated with {{the title of the}} ancient papal envoys, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not perform any diplomatic duties.|$|R
50|$|In 1906, the South Australian Government did not {{renew the}} Macassans' permit to harvest trepang. This loss of trade caused some {{disruption}} to the Yolŋu way of life, particularly <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not know why}} the Macassan had stopped coming.|$|R
50|$|The Parthians faced no {{opposition}} to their river crossing {{and proceeded to}} the town of Gindarus in Cyrrhestica, confident in their belief that their Roman foes were weak or cowardly, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not attempt to prevent the river crossing.|$|R
25|$|The ecophilosophy of Garrett Hardin is one {{perspective}} {{from which to}} analyze the reproductive rights of human beings. For the most part, Hardin argues that it is immoral to have large families, especially <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> a disservice to society by consuming an excessive amount of resources. In an essay titled The Tragedy of the Commons, Hardin states, By encouraging the freedom to breed, the welfare state not only provides for children, but also sustains itself in the process. The net effect of such a policy is the inevitability of a Malthusian catastrophe.|$|E
25|$|Scoop {{lights or}} scoops are {{circular}} fixtures {{that do not}} have any lenses. They have an ellipsoidal reflector {{at the back of the}} fixture that directs the light out of the fixture. <b>Since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have any sort of lens system they are cheaper than other fixtures. However, the light cannot be focused at all (even PARs allow more control than scoops). Scoops are most often used to flood the stage with light from above, or to light backdrops. Scoops can have gels affixed. Occasionally they are used as work lights (see below).|$|E
25|$|Spiders {{typically}} have eight walking legs (insects have six). They {{do not have}} antennae; the pair of appendages {{in front of the}} legs are the pedipalps (or just palps). Spiders' legs are made up of seven segments. Starting from the body end, these are the coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, metatarsus and tarsus. The tip of the tarsus bears claws, which vary in number and size. Spiders that spin webs {{typically have}} three claws, the middle one being small; hunting spiders typically have only two claws. <b>Since</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have antennae, spiders use specialised and sensitive setae on their legs to pick up scent, sounds, vibrations and air currents.|$|E
50|$|This {{resulted}} {{from the fact that}} the first Tamil settlers took in local wives, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not bring along any of their own women with them. Over time, the Chitty gathered physical features that were less Indian and more Malay-looking.|$|R
