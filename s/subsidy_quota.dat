Recently, {{attention is focused}} on the use of economic incentives to reduce pesticide use and its related indirect effects. The aim of this work is to assess the effectiveness of different economic instruments such as taxes and levies in encouraging farmers to decrease pesticide use and their environmental spillovers. A policy simulation model is employed using data from Dutch cash crop producers including two pesticide categories that differ in terms of toxicity and pesticides’ environmental spillovers. Four different instruments were selected for evaluation: pesticide taxes, price penalties on pesticides’ environmental spillovers, <b>subsidies,</b> and <b>quotas.</b> The results of the study indicate that even high taxes and penalties would result in a small decrease in pesticide use and environmental spillovers. Taxes that differentiate according to toxicity do not lead to substitution of high- with low-toxicity pesticides. Subsidies on low-toxicity products are not able to affect the use of high-toxicity products. Pesticide quotas are more effective in reducing pesticide use and environmental spillovers...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{analytical}} and numerical general equilibrium models {{to assess the}} efficiency impacts of agricultural policies in a second-best setting with pre-existing distortionary taxes. We analyze production <b>subsidies,</b> production <b>quotas,</b> acreage controls, <b>subsidies</b> for acreage reductions and lump sum transfers to agricultural producers. We find that pre-existing taxes raise the cost of all these policies and by a substantial amount. Under our central estimates this increase in cost is typically at least 100 - 200 percent. Two effects underlie these results. First, raising the rates of distortionary taxes to finance subsidy policies leads to additional efficiency losses. Second, policies that raise (lower) the costs of producing agricultural output lead to a reduction (increase) in the economy-wide level of employment. This implies an efficiency loss (gain) in the labor market, which is distorted by taxes. The latter effect is not incorporated in earlier studies. Consequently, previous studies have significantly overstated the costs of production subsidies and understated the costs of production quotas, acreage controls and subsidies for acreage reductions. ...|$|R
40|$|Supply, Land Quality, and Policy Recent {{reforms of}} the EC grain sector justify renewed {{interest}} in the supply ^alysis of producer policies that include a subsidy and a land reduction requirement.

CAP reform, introducing producer subsidies, low?? price and set-aside. 2, Transition from central planning. But land quality is an important dimension of producer's participation decisions (Brooks et al.). And the implications of producers with marginal land on market supply still require discussion. The potential for domestic supply distortions and price stability are relevant if trade agreements include such policies.

40|$|Since the Second World War, the {{agricultural}} subsidies of many advanced industrialized economies have presented a paradox of political economy. Abundant in capital relative {{to land and}} labor, these nations do not enjoy comparative advantages in agriculture. The perpetuation of agriculture through devices such as export <b>subsidies,</b> import <b>quotas,</b> and income supports conflict with Pareto-optimal trade policy. What explains this outcome? Traditionally, agriculture has overcome the problem of collective action described by Stolper-Samuelson and Ronald Rogowski. Agriculture penetrates representative governments to win protection from more efficient foreign rivals. However, the Uruguay Round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiation initiated the gradual erosion of many mechanisms of producer protection. The much-publicized stalemates of the Doha round of international trade negotiation belie substantive liberalization within even the most entrenched systems of agricultural protection since Uruguay. What explains recent deviation from past policies?

40|$|The {{establishment}} of the Common Market, a more inward looking trade policy {{on the part of}} the United States and, last but not least, the urgent demand of less developed countries for free access to the markets of the highly industrialized nations have revived international interest in the impact of foreign trade regulations on a country s domestic industry. One of the major points of interest is to analyse how trade regulations influence the comparative costs of domestic industries and consequently the structural pattern of industry. Protective measures such as tariffs, import <b>quotas,</b> <b>subsidies</b> and taxes alter a given industrial pattern by providing some industries with an advantage, while the economic conditions of others remain unchanged or even worsen.

In general the analysis presented in this paper tries to quantify the effects of trade liberalisation from EU side and growing protectionism against third countries on the Estonian trade with food products. Due to a low prices and protection level at present, many food prices are expected to rise. However, this rise in prices and the consequent increase in production and export depend on the competitiveness of in Estonian products on the markets in the present EU member states. Since January 2000 Estonia already implemented limited tariffs on food products against third countries. Implementation of partial equilibrium analyses allowed to show that trade diversion has taken place as a result of it ¾ the import from third countries has been partly driven out by the import from the European Union and the countries Estonia has free trade agreements with. In the case of some agricultural products it can be supposed that the price increase in imports has also influenced Estonian producer and retail prices.

40|$|Doctor Legum - LLDAfrican {{countries}} {{are faced with}} the daunting task of providing a comprehensive regulatory framework for their natural resources. This is at both the international and domestic level. The statement is particularly true for emerging African oil producing countries. Related to the above, {{it can be argued that}} production <b>quotas,</b> <b>subsidies,</b> and corruption continue to hinder the full liberalisation of the oil sector globally, and in Africa. Also, these three areas are the genesis of some of the prominent issues in the discussions of trade in energy goods. Although Africa is substantially endowed with natural resources like crude oil, it remains at the bottom of the development pecking order; accordingly, it has to get centrally involved in the debate on the regulation of international trade in oil to encourage development and to benefit from the resource. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are the most relevant organisations in the collective regulation of production <b>quotas,</b> oil consumption <b>subsidies</b> and the control of corruption in the oil sector. Both organisations, directly for the former, and indirectly for the latter, deal with trade between nations. OPEC‘s mandate is established in the OPEC Statute, while the mandate of the WTO is found in various multilateral and plurilateral agreements. However, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1994) (GATT), the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM), and the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) are the most relevant. The Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) is only discussed where relevant. This is because the treaty is based on the WTO framework. Also, several provisions in the WTO agreements are not fully discussed in the ECT. OPEC which deals with regulation of oil production and to some extent oil prices in member countries has an effect on trade of the commodity. The role of the WTO however, is more direct as it regulates international trade of various vi goods and services. Thus this thesis investigates how the above legal frameworks regulate production <b>quotas,</b> <b>subsidies,</b> and corruption in the oil sector. The results of the foregoing investigation are then applied to African countries, such as, Nigeria, Angola (members of both the WTO and OPEC) and Ghana, an emerging African oil producing country, to assess the impact of these international rules on the countries‘ legal regimes. Ghana has recently developed its crude oil sector. The success of the nascent oil sector of this country may depend on the conception or improvement of a comprehensive legal framework, to regulate international trade in oil. It is apparent that without an effective legal framework to regulate international trade in oil, the discovery of oil in Ghana, may not make any long term positive impact on the current economic conditions. Ghana is a member of the WTO; however, it is yet to join OPEC, despite growing debate on its membership in the organisation...|$|R
