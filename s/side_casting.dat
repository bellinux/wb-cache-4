60|$|The warm {{sunlight}} was glancing {{among the}} thickly growing pine {{trees in the}} plantation by her <b>side,</b> <b>casting</b> quaint shadows on the cone-strewn ground, across the little piece of broken paling {{in the bottom of}} the dry ditch, and upon the mossy bank where his head was resting upon a sweet-smelling tuft of heather. Most of all it flashed and glittered upon the inch or two of steel which still lay buried in his side--a curiously shaped little dagger which, although she strove to keep her eyes away from it, seemed to have a sort of fascination for her. Every time her eyes fell upon it, she turned away quickly with a little shudder; but, nevertheless, she looked at it more than once--and she remembered it.|$|E
60|$|But who {{can express}} the {{thoughts}} of a man's heart, coming on a sudden into {{a place where the}} whole world seemed to be on fire! The valley was, on one side, so exceeding bright the eye could scarce bear to look at it; the sides of the mountains were shining like the fire itself; the flame {{from the top of the}} mountain on the other <b>side</b> <b>casting</b> its light directly upon them. From thence the reflection into other parts looked red, and more terrible; for the first was white and clear, like the light of the sun; but the other, being, as it were, a reflection of light mixed with some darker cavities, represented the fire of a furnace; and, in short, it might well be said here was no darkness; but certainly, at the first view, it gives a traveller no other idea than that of being at the very entrance into eternal horror.|$|E

Nevertheless, the major kept on through the gully, until {{reaching}} the wagon road they crossed it, and began to ascend the opposite slope, half hidden by the underbrush and larches. Here the major paused again and faced about. The cabins of the settlement were already behind the bluff; the little stream which indicated the [...] "bar"--on which some perfunctory mining was still continued--now and then rang out quite clearly at their feet, although the bar itself had disappeared. The sounds of occupation and labor had at last died away in the distance. They were quite alone. The major {{sat down on a}} boulder, and pointed to another. The man, however, remained sullenly standing where he was, as if to accent as strongly as possible the enforced companionship. Either the major was too self-absorbed to notice it, or accepted it as a satisfactory characteristic of the half-breed's race. He continued confidently:-- ...|$|E

5000|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} carriage holds the tool bit and moves it longitudinally (turning) or perpendicularly (facing) {{under the control}} of the operator. The operator moves the carriage manually via the handwheel (5a) or automatically by engaging the feed shaft with the carriage feed mechanism (5c). This provides some relief for the operator as the movement of the carriage becomes power assisted. The handwheels (2a, 3b, 5a) on the carriage and its related slides are usually calibrated, both for ease of use and to assist in making reproducible cuts. Calibration marks will measure either the distance from center (radius), or the work piece's diameter, so for example, on a diameter machine where calibration marks are in thousandths of an inch, the radial handwheel dial will read [...]0005 inches of radius per division, or [...]001 inches of diameter. The carriage typically comprises a top casting, known as the saddle (4), and a <b>side</b> <b>casting,</b> known as the apron (5).|$|E

A continuing time study was applied during the road construction. To estimate the volume of rock disintegration, the average end area equation was used. The increasing cut-slope height decreased productivity. The productivity of hydraulic hammer averaged at 5. 5 m 3 ·h– 1 for the mean work volume of 5. 07 m 3 ·m– 1. The unit cost of the system was 7. 7 €·m– 3. From the economic point of view a new machine with multipurpose system could be recommended for forest road construction operations in rocky areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{potentiometric}} response {{properties of}} ammonium-, carbonate-, and proton-selective electrodes prepared by incorporating appropriate neutral carriers within novel asymmetric cellulose acetate membranes are reported. The membranes are formed by first casting {{a thin layer}} of cellulose triacetate without carrier, hydrolyzing one side of this film with base, and then on the other <b>side</b> <b>casting</b> a second layer of cellulose triacetate containing the membrane active components. The resulting asymmetric ion-selective membranes function equivalently, in terms of selectivity and response slopes, to non-asymmetric cellulose triacetate membranes and conventional poly(vinyl chloride) -based membranes. The hydrolyzed surface of the asymmetric membranes can be activated in aqueous solution with carbonyldiimidazole for the direct immobilization of proteins {{on the surface of the}} membranes, without loss in potentiometric ion-response. As an example, the immobilization of urease on the surfaces of ammonium- and carbonate-selective membranes yields potentiometric bio-selective urea-probes with desirable dynamic response properties...|$|E

Thus, when a user appears in the top-k results for a sensitive keyword query, she becomes widely exposed in a sensitive context.

In this paper, we propose the first model for quantifying search exposure on the service provider <b>side,</b> <b>casting</b> it into a reverse k-nearest-neighbor problem. Moreover, since a single user can be exposed by a large number of queries, we also devise a learning-to-rank method for identifying the most critical queries and thus making the warnings user-friendly.

30|$|The {{oscillating}} {{strip casting}} process of one <b>side</b> <b>casting</b> roller is always rotating and oscillating, which causes the flow field change. Hence the transient algorithm {{was chosen for}} the simulation of the oscillating strip casting process [24] and the coupled algorithm for solving the pressure and velocity. The pressure interpolation {{was made by the}} Body Force Weighted, and the momentum, turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent kinetic energy dispersion rate and energy equations of the discrete schemed with second order upwind scheme. In the calculation process of the residual iterative convergence conditions are 1 × 10 ^ - 4, except 1 × 10 ^ - 6 for the energy equation. Meanwhile, the initial internal flow field does not completely flow due to the transient algorithm. Therefore, the molten pool flow field velocity variation in one oscillating cycle is not stable and the law of the real production in the oscillating strip casting molten pool flow, can’t be described. Consequently, it is necessary to monitor the velocity of some reference points that changes with time, in the molten pool, which stop the calculation until the reference velocity point size changes periodically with time.|$|E

30|$|At first, no {{significant}} difference between respective AFM images of the freshly casted film (top) and the rinsed film (bottom), after drying respectively, could be observed. This finding supports the stability of ZOL/PEC films after contact to the release medium. Secondly, small PEC particles, whose diameters were sizing around 100  nm could be found. This value can not be directly compared to diameters found by DLS measurements (Table  1), since on the one <b>side</b> <b>casted</b> PEC particles are flattened and are assumed to have a hemispheric profile [26] leading to larger values. On the other <b>side,</b> dried <b>casted</b> PEC particles lost water to a considerable amount leading to smaller values compared to diameters obtained from DLS. Which effect, flattening or shrinking, is dominating or whether both approximately compensate, cannot be figured out exactly. Nevertheless we speculate that drying of casted PEC films is associated with a process of shrinking, flattening and partly merging of individual PEC particles. This results in the remarkable stability of PEC particle films against detachment (see above).|$|R
