40|$|Much has {{recently}} {{been written about the}} South African Navy in World War 2 but comparatively little has been mentioned about South Africans serving in the Royal Navy over the same period. Large drafts of Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve personnel were called up at the outbreak of the war to augment the peacetime crews of British warships and bring them up to their wartime manning scale. One of these groups was dispatched to West Africa to join HMS DRAGON, reputedly in her time the luckiest ship in the Royal Navy. During her career she was comparatively obscure - never doing anything of note and her fame rested entirely on her ability to never be {{in the wrong place at}} any time. She was in fact a maritime dodger, malingerer and <b>skiver</b> and her crew, especially the South Africans aboard, loved her for it. After her luck finally ran out and she was sunk, she became a popular ship in literature (at least three books have been written based on adventures in her) and has since emerged in reference books as a bit of a curiosity because of her original strange design. </p...|$|E

40|$|This chapter argues, {{following}} Angus Calder, {{that there}} was an official line of commemoration of the Second World War: a mythic construction that celebrated heroism, courage, resourcefulness, loyalty and patriotism. It valorised the virtues of the responsible middle class and of officers. Drawing on a range of cultural sources, The chapter concentrates on a counter-hegemonic construction: the 'other war' - a war of <b>skivers,</b> shirkers and petty criminals out for individual gain who displayed the reverse qualities to those lauded in the official myth. The mode for this alternative construction was comedy, which could present this disturbing and unsettling construction under the guise of 'harmless fun'. The chapter focuses on a group of service comedies made from 1945 - 65 that celebrated the wit, respurcefulness and bloodymindedness of the working-class ordinary serviceman and woman which were highly popular and so spoke to a deep-seated irreverence in Britsh culture...|$|R
40|$|According {{to recent}} {{government}} figures, 10 {{million people in}} the UK are over 65 years old. The latest projections are for 5 ½ million more elderly people in 20 years’ time and the number will have nearly doubled to around 19 million by 2050. These statistics have considerable consequences for public services. They are also significant when one considers the stratification of contemporary British society and its emphasis on economically active members [...] as exemplified in George Osborne’s 2012 / 3 strivers not <b>skivers</b> rhetoric. A recent headline in The Daily Telegraph (a media outlet well known for its Conservative leanings) stated that the ‘NHS faces 'bankruptcy' over ageing population’. Similarly, the BBC news website produced a headline that read ‘Ageing population 'to strain NHS'’. This language is important for two reasons. Firstly, it points to a need within the National Health Service to find alternative strategies for health and wellbeing in relation to the elderly community. Secondly, it points to a growing tendency to blame a section of society for its ‘drain on services’. As part of a wider project on Applied Theatre and Ageing, it is hoped this paper will begin to question the social exclusion of our society’s older members and the response of arts practice to that exclusion. The project will focus on innovative practice that seeks not only to include but that also responds to a contemporary phenomenon, the extraordinary growth of a particular group in society, a group with complex social, health and wellbeing needs...|$|R
40|$|Inclusion Scotland {{has been}} {{actively}} opposing the current drift of “welfare reforms” since {{well before the}} Coalition Government took power. It was the last Labour Government who introduced the Work Capability Assessment regime and gave ATOS (a private sector firm specialising in IT) the contract {{to carry out the}} assessments. It was they too who first indulged in the “strivers v <b>skivers</b> ” rhetoric that has done so much to poison public debate and stigmatise all benefit recipients as “skivers”. Why have we been so opposed to “reforms ” when their stated aim is to improve and simplify the complex benefit system? Because they do nothing of the sort and are instead a cover for cuts to the living standards of unemployed, low paid and disabled people. The reforms also apply a “one size fits all ” approach to service delivery that {{does not take into account}} the barriers experienced by those with learning difficulties, mental health issues, sensory or physical impairments. Instead it would hardly be hyperbole to claim that current welfare reforms may represent the single greatest threat to disabled people’s right and ability to live independently in over a generation. When the Coalition Government introduced its austerity agenda they claimed that the ‘deepest cuts would fall on the broadest shoulders’. Instead most cuts (other than tax cuts for high earners!) are falling on those already poor and excluded. Disabled people, along with women, seem to have been singled out for the most savage cuts. Scale of the Cuts: Households containing a disabled person are being subjected to over half of the total of £ 22 billion of benefit cuts already announced (Grant & Woo...|$|R
