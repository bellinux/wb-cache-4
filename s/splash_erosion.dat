40|$|Soil surface {{roughness}} not only delays overland flow generation but also strongly affects overland flow distribution. However, little {{work has been}} done to find a link between soil roughness and overland flow characteristics. This is made difficult because soil roughness and hence overland flow characteristics evolve as a result of soil erosion processes, but this evolution may be very different depending on whether <b>splash</b> or flow <b>erosion</b> dominates. The present study examines the potential of using the concept of structural and functional connectivity to link roughness characteristics to overland flow characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogemorphic {{linkages}} {{related to}} sediment transport in headwater streams following basin wide clear-cut logging on Prince of Wales Island, southeast Alaska, were investigated. Landslides and debris flows transported sediment and woody debris in headwater tributaries in 1961, 1979, and 1993. Widespread landsliding in 1961 and 1993 {{was triggered by}} rainstorms with recurrence intervals (24 h precipitation) of 7. 0 years and 4. 2 years respectively. Occurrence, distribution, and downstream effects of these mass movements were controlled by landform characteristics such as channel gradient and valley configuration. Landslides and channelized debris flows created exposed bedrock reaches, log jams, fans, and abandoned channels. The terminus of the deposits did not enter main channels because debris flows spread and thinned on the unconfined bottom of the U-shaped glaciated valley. Chronic sediment input to channels included surface erosion of exposed till (rain <b>splash,</b> sheet <b>erosion,</b> and freeze - thaw action) and bank failures. Bedload sediment transport in a channel impacted by 1993 landslides and debris flows was two to ten times greater and relatively finer compared with bedload transport in a young alder riparian channel that had last experienced a landslide and debris flow in 1961. Sediment transport and storage were influenced by regeneration of riparian vegetation, storage behind recruited woody debris, development of a streambed armour layer, and the decoupling of hillslopes and channels. Both spatial and temporal variations of sediment movement and riparian condition are important factors in understanding material transport within headwaters and through channel networks.

40|$|Soil erosion is a {{key issue}} in rangelands, but current {{approaches}} for predicting soil erosion are based on research in croplands {{and may not be}} appropriate for rangelands. An improved model is needed that accounts for the dominant erosion processes that operate in rangelands rather than croplands. In addition, effective application of such a model of rangeland erosion requires improved methods for assessing both model sensitivity and uncertainty if the model is to be applied confidently in natural resources management. I developed a new equation for calculating the combined rate of <b>splash</b> and sheet <b>erosion</b> (Dss, kg/m 2) using existing rainfall-simulation data sets from the western United States that is distinct from that for croplands: Dss = Kss I 1. 052 q 0. 592, where Kss is the <b>splash</b> and sheet <b>erosion</b> coefficient, I (m/s) is rainfall intensity, and q (mm/hr) is runoff rate. This equation, which accounts for inter-relationship between I and q, was incorporated into a new model, the Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM). This new model was better at predicting observed erosion rates than the commonly used, existing soil erosion model Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP). New approaches for assessing model uncertainty and sensitivity were developed and applied to the model. The new approach for quantifying localized sensitivity indices, when combined with techniques such as correlation analysis and scatter plots, can be used effectively to compare the sensitivity of different inputs, locate sensitive regions in the parameter space, decompose the dependency of the model response on the input parameters, and identify nonlinear and incorrect relationships in the model. The approach for assessing model predictive uncertainty, called "Dual-Monte-Carlo" (DMC), uses two Monte-Carlo sampling loops to not only calculate predictive uncertainty for one input parameter set, but also examine the predictive uncertainty as a function of model inputs across the full range of parameter space. Both approaches were applied to RHEM and yielded insights into model behavior. Collectively, this research provides an important advance in developing improved predictions of erosion rates in rangelands and simultaneously provides new approaches for model sensitivity and uncertainty analyses that can be applied to other models and disciplines...|$|R
5000|$|Surface runoff {{can cause}} {{erosion of the}} Earth's surface; eroded {{material}} may be deposited a considerable distance away. There are four main types of soil erosion by water: <b>splash</b> <b>erosion,</b> sheet erosion, rill erosion and gully erosion. <b>Splash</b> <b>erosion</b> {{is the result of}} mechanical collision of raindrops with the soil surface: soil particles which are dislodged by the impact then move with the surface runoff. Sheet erosion is the overland transport of sediment by runoff without a well defined channel. Soil surface roughness causes may cause runoff to become concentrated into narrower flow paths: as these incise, the small but well-defined channels which are formed are known as rills. These channels can be as small as one centimeter wide or as large as several meters. If runoff continue to incise and enlarge rills, they may eventually grow to become gullies. Gully erosion can transport large amounts of eroded material in a small time period. Reduced crop productivity usually results from erosion, and these effects are studied in the field of soil conservation. The soil particles carried in runoff vary in size from about [...]001 millimeter to 1.0 millimeter in diameter. Larger particles settle over short transport distances, whereas small particles can be carried over long distances suspended in the water column. Erosion of silty soils that contain smaller particles generates turbidity and diminishes light transmission, which disrupts aquatic ecosystems.|$|E

To determine the characteristics of <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> under crop canopies, corn, soybean, millet, and winter wheat were collected, and the relationship among <b>splash</b> <b>erosion,</b> rainfall intensity, and throughfall intensity under different crop canopies was analyzed through artificial rainfall experiments. The results showed that, the mean splash detachment rate on the ground surface was 390. 12 g/m 2 ?h, which was lower by 67. 81 % than that on bare land. The inhibiting effects of crops on <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> increased as the crops grew, and the ability of the four crops to inhibit <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> was in the order of winter wheat. corn. soybeans. millet. An increase in rainfall intensity could significantly enhance the occurrence of <b>splash</b> <b>erosion,</b> but the ability of crops to inhibit <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> was 13 % greater in cases of higher rainfall intensity. The throughfall intensity under crop canopies was positively related to the splash detachment rate, and this relationship was more significant when the rainfall intensity was 40 mm/h. <b>Splash</b> <b>erosion</b> tended to occur intensively in the central row of croplands as the crop grew, and the non-uniformity of <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> was substantial, with <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> occurring mainly between the rows and in the region directly under the leaf margin.

This study characterized the influence of conversion of tropical rainforest to rubber plantation on potential <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> rate and actual <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> rate. The average potential <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> rate was 2. 1 times higher in the rubber plantation than in the open, while for the rainforest it was only 1. 2 times higher than in the open, suggesting that the rubber plantation canopy greatly increased the rainsplash erosion. The average actual <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> rate was 2. 0 times higher in the rubber plantation than in the rainforest, demonstrating that the rainforest was more effective in controlling <b>splash</b> <b>erosion.</b> The actual <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> rate was considerably lower in the terrace bench than in the riser bank in the rubber plantation, indicating that the riser bank was more sensitive to raindrop splash. Hence, protection of terrace risers with productive vegetation or litter/mulch layer is of vital importance in this bench-terraced rubber plantation.

40|$|Considerable {{soil water}} {{repellency}} {{has been observed}} at {{a wide range of}} locations worldwide. The soil exhibiting water repellency is found within {{the upper part of the}} soil profile. The reduced rate of water infiltration into these soils leads to severe run-off erosion, and reduction of plant growth. Soil water repellency is promoted by drying of soil, and can be induced by fire or intense heating of soil containing hydrophobic organic matter. Recent studies outside of soil science have shown how enhancement of the natural water repellency of materials, both porous and granular, by surface texture (i. e. surface roughness, pattern and morphology) into super-hydrophobicity is possible. The similarities between these super-hydrophobic materials and observed properties of water-repellent soil are discussed from a non-soil scientist materials-based perspective. A simple model is developed for a hydrophobic granular surface and it is shown that this can provide a mechanism for enhancement of soil water repellency through the relative size and spacing of grains and pores. The model provides a possible explanation for why soil water repellency should be more prevalent under dry conditions than wet. Consequences for water run-off, raindrop <b>splash</b> and soil <b>erosion</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The most cited {{definition}} of a rill is "a microchannel ( [...] .) small enough to be removed by normal tillage operations" (FAO 1965, op. cit. Bryan 1987, op. cit. Selby 1993) although, according to Bryan (1987), a more precise {{definition of}} the term ârillâ would be useful. Its width and depth is normally measured in centimeters (Summerfield 1991; Carson & Kirkby 1972) or even in millimeters (Van Asch 1997) and its maximum depth is often arbitrarily chosen as half a meter. When a rill cannot be removed anymore by agricultural practice it has become a gully. The formation of gullies {{is quite different from the}} formation of rills, and will therefore not be treated here. Rill initiation by overland flow can be viewed in two ways (Kirkby 1980; Rauws 1987). The first view is that rill generation is caused by the lack of balance between the infilling of juvenile rills by inter-rill processes - such as <b>splash</b> and wash <b>erosion</b> - at one side, and widening and deepening of young rills by rill processes - such as small mass movements and headcutting - at the other side. This view was first proposed by Smith & Bretherton (1972) in a conceptual model...|$|R
40|$|Information {{is scarce}} on the spatial-scale effect on {{sediment}} concentrations in run-off. This study addressed this issue within an agricultural subwatershed of the Chinese Loess Plateau, using data observed at a hilltop plot, three nested hillslope plots, two entire-slope plots (a combination of hillslope and valley side slope) and the subwatershed outlet. Dominated by the <b>splash</b> and sheet <b>erosions,</b> the hilltop plot has a minimum C-ae (mean sediment concentration for all recorded events) of 45 kgm(- 3). Unexpectedly, the high sediment concentrations at the hilltop {{do not occur}} at high rainfall intensities or large run-off events because of the protection of surface soils by relatively thick sheet flows. Because {{of the emergence of}} rills, C-ae is as high as 310 kg m(- 3) even on the most upper hillslope. Downslope, both C-ae and ESC (extreme large values of recorded sediment concentrations) increase; such a slope length effect attenuates with increasing slope length and event magnitude as a result of insufficient sediment availability associated with rill development. Active mass wastings ensure sufficient sediment supply and thus a spatially invariant C-ae (approximately 700 kgm(- 3)) and ESC (approximately 1000 kg m(- 3)) at the scale of the entire slope and subwatershed. Detailed examination shows that most small events experience a decrease in sediment concentrations when moving from the entire slope to the subwatershed, indicating that the spatially invariant sediment concentration is valid only for large run-off events. This study highlights the control of the spatial scale, which determines the dominant erosional process, on erosional regime. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|As {{the first}} event of soil erosion, rain <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> {{supplies}} materials for subsequent transportation and entrainment. The Loess Plateau, the southern hilly {{region and the}} Northeast China are subject to serious soil and water loss; however, the characteristics of rain <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> in those regions are still unclear. The objectives of the study are to analyze the characteristics of <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> on loess soil, red soil, purple soil and black soil, and to discuss the relationship between <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> and soil properties. Soil samples spatially distributed in the abovementioned regions were collected and underwent simulated rainfalls at a high intensity of 1. 2 mm/min, lasting for 5, 10, 15, and 20 min, respectively. Rain splash and soil crust development were analyzed. It shows that black soil sample from Heilongjiang Province corresponds to the minimum <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> amount because it has high aggregate content, aggregate stability and organic matter content. Loess soil sample from Inner Mongolia corresponds to the maximum <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> amount because it has high content of sand particles.

In addition, it highlights the research gaps and unanswered questions in our understanding of soil erosion processes due to splash. In this literature review, a bibliographic search in Web of Science by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) database was carried out on August the 9 th, 2016, that returned 669 papers containing the words âsplash erosionâ.

Key issues of the cyclic IFE operation include intense photon and ion deposition, wall thermal and hydrodynamic evolution, wall erosion and fatigue lifetime, and chamber clearing and evacuation to ensure chamber conditions prior to target implosion. Several methods for wall protection have been proposed in the past, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. These methods include bare walls, gas-filled cavities, and liquid walls/jets. We have developed detailed models for reflected laser light, emitted photon, and target debris deposition and interaction with chamber components and implemented them in the comprehensive HEIGHTS software package. The hydrodynamic response of gas-filled cavities and photon radiation transport of the deposited energy has been calculated using new and advanced numerical techniques. Fragmentation models of liquid jets {{as a result of}} the deposited energy have also been developed, and the impact on chamber clearing dynamics has been evaluated. The focus of this study is to critically assess the reliability and the dynamic response of chamber walls in various proposed protection methods in IFE systems. Of particular concern is the effect on wall erosion lifetime of various erosion mechanisms, such as vaporization, chemical and physical sputtering, melt/liquid <b>splashing</b> and explosive <b>erosion,</b> and fragmentation of liquid walls. Mass loss and fragmentation in the form of macroscopic particles can be much larger than mass loss due to surface vaporization and sputtering and have not been properly considered in past studies as part of the overall cavity response and reestablishment.

The authors have previously shown that ice crystal particle size {{plays an important role}} in the ice crystal accretion phenomenon. It was also shown that ice crystal particle size affects the degree of natural melt that occurs for a given aerodynamic condition. The data presented herein decouples the effects of ice particle melt and particle size distribution to generate accretions with the same ratio of freestream liquid-to-total water fraction. The effects of wet bulb temperature and ice particle size on the natural melting of ice crystals are discussed. An ice preservation procedure is followed to allow tracings of the accretion to be taken along the test article. Ice crystal particle size distribution is characterized using a shadowgraphy imaging technique. Finally, the reduction in accretion rate relative to the theoretical maximum rate of surface accretion by ice crystal particles is discussed. The test article simulates a forward facing, inclined endwall bleed slot in a gas turbine compressor as a simplified two-dimensional representation. The geometry, having a surface inclined 200 to the incoming flow, proved to be susceptible to mixed phase ice crystal accretion. Particle size and particularly the large particle tail of the distribution had a significant impact on the magnitude of accretion under mixed phase test conditions for wet bulb temperatures above and below 00 C. The leading edge growth rates were found to be 1 / 4 to 1 / 9 of the theoretical growth rate suggesting that <b>erosion,</b> <b>splashing,</b> particle bounce and other loss mechanism rates are significant. The ice tracings were used to estimate an accretion mass for a hypothetical large bypass ratio gas turbine.

40|$|Purpose: Shallow soils {{previously}} cultivated under terraced {{systems may}} change their properties after agricultural release and spontaneous plant colonization. Investigations {{were conducted in}} terraced fields (NE Spain) to prove that vegetation installed after the abandonment may generally improve soil properties by the formation of stable organic horizons. However, restriction in plant species along the natural vegetation succession and intensification of erosion processes may occur after abandonment depending on fire frequency and soil use history. Materials and methods: Ten environments with different plant covers under a Lithic Xerorthent were selected and erosion plots (Gerlach type) installed providing their best adaptability at the terrace scale. Selected soil environments represented the sequence of abandonment: from current poorly cultivated soils, soils under pasture, soils under shrubs, and soils under stands of pine and cork trees. Relevant rainfall events producing runoff and erosion were recorded from November 2011 to May 2012. Erosion rates and erosion components were analysed in sediments and water in order to monitor carbon, nitrogen and other nutrient removal by overland flow. Similarly, the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the soil environments under study were determined at the same time interval of runoff erosion. Results and discussion: Soils under pasture, vines and recently burnt pine forest produced the highest runoff followed by soils under shrubs and forest. However, eroded soil yields and nutrient removal were much higher in cultivated soils and soils in recently burnt sites, which had shown poorer soil properties with respect to soils abandoned for longer and preserved by fire. Fire-affected soil environments also showed a thinner organic horizon and reduced water retention. Although erosion rates and nutrient depletion were low in all environments with respect to other areas of Spain, higher <b>splash</b> than water <b>erosion</b> was an early warning indicator of the high susceptibility to degradation of these shallow soils. Conclusions: Results outlined that the renaturalization dynamics after agricultural abandonment are complex biophysical processes involving the parent material, depth to bedrock and other soil properties as well as the succession of vegetative cover and plant associations responsible for building a new soil mantle contrasting with erosion processes.

40|$|ABSTRACT The fallout {{radionuclides}} 137 Cs, 210 Pbex {{are used}} widely for obtaining quantitative information on soil erosion and sediment redistribution rates within agricultural landscapes, over several {{spatial and temporal}} scales, and they are frequently seen to represent a valuable complement to conventional soil erosion measurement techniques. However, measurements of these radionuclides provide estimates of medium term (i. e. 40 - 100 years) soil erosion rates. The shorter-term perspective provided by the 7 Be method {{has the potential to}} estimate soil erosion rates associated with individual events or short periods. The 7 Be method has become increasingly relevant in an environment impacted by climate change, changing land use and other human activities. The present work establishes a mathematical model based on the physical processes of molecular diffusion and radioactive decay, to study the vertical behaviour of 7 Be in soils. This model was further used to quantify erosion rates for 12 individual erosional events over a period of two years at our study site in MÃ¼ncheberg, Germany. The scope of the model was explored analytically as well as numerically for Pulse-like fallout initial condition, zero concentration initial condition and exponential distribution initial condition. The model was fitted to more than 15 depth distributions and the resulting model parameter, effective diffusion coefficient D, is evaluated. In general diffusion coefficients estimated were of the order of 10 - 12 10 - 13 m 2 s- 1 for loamy to sandy soil types. Diffusion coefficients estimated for our study site were about 10 - 13 m 2 s- 1. The soil analyses indicate that the diffusion coefficient D is not merely a fitting parameter, but is related to the physico-chemical properties of radionuclide transport in soils. The erosion rates estimated at tilled and no-till plots at our study site were between < 0. 001 - 4. 7 Â± 0. 4 kg m- 2 and 0. 3 Â± 0. 5 kg m- 2 - 2. 0 Â± 1. 4 kg m- 2 respectively. The magnitude of erosion rates estimated at the no-till plots was less than that at the tilled plots. The main conclusions of this work are: -	The mathematical model developed during this study describes the transport of 7 Be in soils. It is the first extensive model proposed so far that despite of its many simplifications, adequately represents the exponential distribution of 7 Be profiles at disturbed and undisturbed or reference sites. -	Main physical processes, which transport of 7 Be in soil are, diffusion and radioactive decay. Migration parameters and measurements confirm that sorption is the main physical process, which confines 7 Be concentration to soil surface. -	Current erosion estimation methods with 7 Be available in the literature for estimating erosion rates for single rainfall event was successfully modified to quantify erosion rates for multiple rainfall events. -	Erosion rates estimated with 7 Be technique were successfully used to differentiate between the rill-interrill, <b>splash</b> and surface <b>erosion</b> at the study plot. -	The Diffusion model proposed in this study {{does not take into account}} the vegetation cover and thus overestimates the erosion rates or in some cases shows the occurrence of deposition on the plot...|$|R
40|$|The {{scale of}} the problem {{may be subject to}} debate - but there is no doubting that land {{degradation}} {{is one of the most}} serious threats to food production over much of Africa. In extreme cases land may be so badly degraded that it is abandoned by farmers, but it is the gradual degradation of soil fertility that menaces farmers throughout the continent which is more sinister and widespread. Many soil and water conservation projects have failed in the past, so what now is the best strategy to assist farmers in restoring their cultivated land to full productivity? In parts of the West African Sahel, there are tracts of land which are denuded and effectively sterile. These include the Fako of Niger and the Zipeela of Burkina Faso. A hard cap on the surface of the soil resists the infiltration of runoff, and practically no plants grow. It was not always like this. Land was originally cleared from the bush for cropping and rested after a period of cultivation. But with growing population, fallow periods have become shorter, and cultivation cycles longer. Soil fertility levels are severely depleted during the cropping cycle, because plant products are removed from the fields at successive harvests and nothing is returned. The fallowing of such land often does not lead to its regeneration - especially when rainfall is less than in former times. Over the last few decades, this spiral of degradation has created many thousands of hectares of abandoned land in the West African Sahel. Less dramatic, but more important to the continent as a whole, is the gradual process of soil fertility degradation in areas where crop production is better favoured by the climate. In these zones, continuous cultivation is rarely balanced by nutrient return in the form of fertilizers, manure or compost. Overall losses of plant nutrients from the system are increased by permitting <b>splash</b> and sheet <b>erosion,</b> which selectively remove the richest fraction of the soil. Where this is the case, yields continue to decline and in turn soil becomes increasingly susceptible to erosion. There is growing evidence that Africa's soils are being 'mined' of nutrients. In Kenya, for example, which hosts one of the continent's most successful soil and water conservation programmes, there is increasing concern that despite the measures introduced, crop yields are not always being maintained, and indeed are sometimes falling. This problem is echoed elsewhere: in the matooke banana plantations of Uganda, for example. If current and future needs for food, fodder and fuel are to be met, efforts have to be made to restore degraded land to its former productivity. The question is how this can best be achieved, both technically and organizationally. The 'Project' approach and its failings The conventional approach of governments and donor agencies in Africa is to address the problem of land degradation through the implementation of soil conservation, range management or afforestation projects. The project approach is attractive to donors in particular, because it is a neat, discrete 'package' with tight geograchical boundaries and a limited timeframe, and because it can operate outside the bureaucracy of mainstream government. There was a burgeoning of soil and water conservation projects in the 1980 s as governments, and donors, became more concerned with erosion. Currently there are numerous projects funded by multi-and bilateral donor agencies as well as by NGOs. Millions of dollars are spent each year on soil and water conservation, range management and afforestation projects. Projects typically have a life span of around five years, with defined targets to treat, perhaps, a few thousand hectares. It is clear that such targets are a drop in the ocean compared with the {{scale of the}} problem. At current rates of implementation it would take more than a century to address the present levels of land degradation in Africa. Furthermore the area of land subject to land degradation is not stable, but increasing. Projects clearly cannot, in themselves, answer the problem, even if they were successful. And many soil and water conservation projects have produced disappointing results. Part of the explanation of these failures can be attributed to the techniques the projects promote. Structures, such as large terrace banks, are often not appropriate and, as a result, are neither appreciated nor adequately maintained by the 'beneficiaries'. Instead of conserving land, poorly maintained structures may subsequently actually lead to increased erosion by concentrating runoff through overtopping or breaching. Another weakness of conventional conservation projects is the costs of the techniques promoted. The costs of some machinery-built terraces in the Sahel can be in excess of US 1000 per hectare. If land degradation is to be reversed on hundreds of thousands of hectares this level of funding is clearly absurd. In order to attain their targets, many projects rely on the use of machinery and the provision of food-for-work to support manual labour. But practice shows that such incentives mask the true level of interest by local farmers: subsequent lack of maintenance exposes the prime reason for 'participation' during construction. True participation of the local land users is vital to the success of any project or development process; it is the human resource which must be tapped for any lasting success, and people will only respond when they appreciate the return to their investments. Finally, most soil and water conservation activities come to a grinding halt as soon as external funding is withdrawn, because governments in Africa simply do not have the funds to keep up project-style operations. Governments lose face as a result, and the land users are disillusioned. The inescapable conclusion is that it makes no sense to continue funding conventional top-down projects because their direct impact is very limited, and their legacy may even be counterproductive in the fight against land degradation. The alternative: a 'Process' approach The challenge is to create a situation in which hundreds of thousands of land users are motivated to invest their own labour and their own limited resources in the management of their land. Projects can have a role to play in the development of what may be called a 'process approach'. The question is how to switch from the project approach, with its engineering bias, fixed targets and timespan, to a process in which the land users themselves become the main actors. Such a radical change will require fundamental revisions in attitudes of governments as well as of donor agencies. At the heart of such a policy change is the acknowledgment that (I) only farmers themselves can be the effective agents of implementation on any significant scale, and (2) while projects may be a starting point for development funds, eventually there needs to be a national programme of land husbandry (or whatever name is preferred) which involves adequately trained multi-purpose agricultural extension agents. At least three necessary conditions have to be fulfilled to create a situation in which farmers will adopt conservation packages: 7 Train staff and farmers Land cannot be restored in any significant quantity without the involvement of farmers. So there is a need to motivate and train farmers - women as well as men. However, extension staff must be trained first. There is no great mystery to the basics of soil conservation and land husbandry. Multipurpose agricultural extension agents can be trained to understand the technical principles, as well as the approaches neccessary to encourage and motivate farmers to participate. There is no need for a specialised, and expensive, cadre of soil conservation agents. The next stage is farmer motivation and training. This must become a key activity in the overall process. After initial participatory planning sessions, where perceptions and possible remedies are discussed, there is a role for exchange visits. There is nothing new about moving farmers to a different area to observe how others are addressing similar problems, but recent experiences with this methodology have highlighted its effectiveness - for example in Niger (see box 1). A recent UNSO project proposal for a water harvesting project in the Sahel is essentially based on farmer-to-farmer extension and it proposes to arrange visits to other regions for more than 10. 000 farmers. Technical training, for example training in the use of simple survey tools and in compost production, is also important as it helps to 'demystify' technology and gives farmers confidence. 7 Get the technical package right Conservation techniques are needed which are simple, efficient and relatively low-cost. Above all there is the need for more emphasis on better 'land husbandry' through which the restoration process is linked to improved plant productivity. For example, compost-in' and manuring increase soil nutrient levels and lead to better soil structure, making the system immediately more productive as well as more resilient to erosion. Agroforestry methods, such as barrier hedges of nitrogen-fixing leguminous species, may have an important role to play. Grass strips are another alternative to earth bunds in areas where there is enough rainfall to support them. If the grass species planted is palatable, such as bane grass, it can be cut and carried for stall-fed livestock. The farmer gains a double benefit. In the West African Sahel, as a result of experiments carried out collaboratively between NGO staff and land users themselves, simple structural techniques have become available for the drier cultivated zones. These include contour stone bunds (appropriate where loose stone is available) and wide planting pits, both of which collect and concentrate rainfall runoff and thereby help crop growth. In each case compost, and sometimes mineral fertilizers, are advised so that the crop does not|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the importance of <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> versus runoff for the export of total pyrogenic carbon and OREC from soil. Our methodological approach included the comparison of 1 m(2) plots with <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> to 1 m(2) plots where <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> was prevented by mosquito nets. On these plots, we quantified total pyrogenic carbon and OREC in the soil before and after the rainfall simulation.

Our results showed that 7 - 55 % of pyrogenic carbon was subject to horizontal and another 23 - 46 % of initial deposited pyrogenic C subject to vertical transport. The export of total pyrogenic carbon and OREC at least doubled on plots where splash was allowed. OREC was less prone to vertical transport than total pyrogenic C. We explained the contrasting observation for both carbon types by the favourable floating behaviour of OREC compared to higher sedimentation rates of other pyrogenic C types, which may partly lead to redistribution of the latter.

40|$|Introduction: The {{detachment}} {{process can}} be conceptually divided in two sub-processes included aggregate breakdown (Le Bissonnais, 1996) and movement initiation of breakdown products(Kinnell, 2005). soil detachment depends on raindrop size and mass(Elison, 1944; Bisal, 1960), drop velocity(Elison, 1944; Bisal, 1960), intensity rainfall (Ting et al, 2008), kinetic energy (Kinnell, 2003; Fernandez- Raga et al, 2010), runoff depth(Torri et al, 1987; Kinnell, 1991 and 2005), crop covers(Bancy, 1994; Ghahremani et al, 2011), wind speed(Erpul et al, 2000) and experimental area (cup size) (Leguedois et al, 2005; Luk, 1979; Torri and poesen, 1988). Many of {{studies have been conducted}} to evaluate the relationship between splash and slope (Bryan, 1979; Torri and Poesen, 1992; Wan et al, 1996). Torri and Poesen (1992) expressed that in steep slope the gravity force adds to the drop detaching force and decreases of soil resistance, consequently increases <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> rate with increasing slope. Soil <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> is also strongly influenced by soil properties including soil particles size distribution (Mazurak and Mosher, 1968; Legout et al, 2005; fan and li, 1993), soil shear strength(Cruse and Larson, 1977; Al-Durrah and Bradford, 1981; Ekwue and ohi; 1990), soil cohesion(Torri et al, 1987), soil organic matter content and aggregate size (Ekwue and Maiduguri, 1991; Qinjuan et al, 2008), soil aggregates stability(Qinjuan et al, 2008), surface crust (Qinjuan et al, 2008). Fire, {{play an important role in}} <b>splash</b> <b>erosion.</b> The absence of vegetation cover in disturbed lands accelerates <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> rates by as much as several folds compared to undisturbed sites (Lal, 2001; Thomaz and luiz, 2012). The detachment of soil particles by splash depends on several raindrop characteristics, including raindrop size and mass, drop velocity, kinetic energy, and water drop impact angle (Sharma et al., 1993; Singer and Le Bissonnais, 1998; Cruse et al., 2000, Bhattacharyya et al., 2010). Detachment rate is strongly influenced by soil properties, including soil texture and thickness of the water layer at the soil surface (De Ploey and Savat, 1968; Moss and Green, 1983; Sharma et al., 1991; Kinnell, 1991, Jomaa et al., 2010), soil strength, bulk density, cohesion, soil organic matter content, moisture content, infiltration capacity (Nearing et al., 1988; Owoputi, 1994; Morgan et al., 1998, Planchon et al., 2000, Ghahramani et al., 2011), soil initial water content, surface compaction and roughness (Planchon et al., 2000), the nature of soil aggregates and crust, porosity, capacity of ionic interchange, and clay content (Poesen and Torri, 1988). Several studies have shown that splash detachment rate is mainly related to surface rock fragments in soils with sparse vegetation cover (Jomaa et al., 2012). The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of fire on <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> and some erosion depended properties in semi-steppe rangeland of Karsanak region in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province which affected by man-made fire during 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011.

40|$|Soil {{erodibility}} is {{an important}} parameter to determine the sensibility of soil to the erosion {{and there are many}} methods to specify the erodibility. Until today, many methods were improved and the âUniversal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), which has the most common use in worldwide, is one of them. In this prediction technology, the soil susceptibility to the water erosion is represented by a multiplier factor together with those for climate, topography, vegetation and conservation practices. This study aimed to determine a soil erodibility factor by the laboratory simulated rainfall tests under the specified kinetic energy and rainfall intensity values using the splash cups. For test soils, a total of 256 surface samples were taken from the fallow-crop system in the Asartepe Dam Basin and the <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> rate was found with the units compatible with the USLE.

40|$|In a {{long-term}} field trial in northwestern Switzerland, {{the effects of}} organic and conventional land-use management on earthworm populations and on soil erodibility were investigated. A silt loam soil which had developed in deep deposits of alluvial loess characterised the study site.

40|$|Wildfire {{may lead}} to {{long-term}} soil carbon gain or loss, depending {{on the ability of}} the system to conserve chemically stable black carbon (BC). Rainfall events can lead to erosion of this organic matter form deposited on the soil surface. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify horizontal as well as vertical BC transport during a rainfall simulation experiment with sandy soil in northern Senegal. The conceptual approach consisted of artificial burning of harvested residues, which were subsequently exposed to two different rainfall regimes: with and without occurrence of splash. After the rainfall simulation experiment, we quantified the total amount of carbon added to the soil and chemically recalcitrant black carbon (BC) (1) exported from the plots, (2) infiltated into the soil and (3) remaining on the soil surface. Transport processes affected around 40 - 60 % of the total carbon and BC added. Our results showed that 30 % of the total carbon added by the fire was exported from the site, whereas another 15 % were vertically transported into the soil. BC, which represented about 40 % of the total carbon added, was transported in higher proportions compared to total C (horizontally as well as vertically) when the <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> was allowed to occurr. The preferential export of BC was strongly dependent on the rainfall regime: when <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> was suppressed, BC export was greatly reduced, whereas BC infiltration increased compared to rainfall with splash occurring.

40|$|Fire is {{a natural}} factor of {{landscape}} evolution in Mediterranean ecosystems. The middle Ebro Valley has extreme aridity, which results in a low plant cover and high soil erodibility, especially on gypseous substrates. The aim {{of this research is}} to analyze the effects of moderate heating on physical and chemical soil properties, mineralogical composition and susceptibility to <b>splash</b> <b>erosion.</b> Topsoil samples (15 cm depth) were taken in the Remolinos mountain slopes (Ebro Valley, NE Spain) from two soil types: Leptic Gypsisol (LP) in a convex slope and Haplic Gypsisol (GY) in a concave slope. To assess the heating effects on the mineralogy we burned the soils at 105 and 205 Â°C in an oven and to assess the splash effects we used a rainfall simulator under laboratory conditions using undisturbed topsoil subsamples (0 â 5 cm depth of Ah horizon). LP soil has lower soil organic matter (SOM) and soil aggregate stability (SAS) and higher gypsum content than GY soil. Gypsum and dolomite are the main minerals (> 80 %) in the LP soil, while gypsum, dolomite, calcite and quartz have similar proportions in GY soil. Clay minerals (kaolinite and illite) are scarce in both soils. Heating at 105 Â°C has no effect on soil mineralogy. However, heating to 205 Â°C transforms gypsum to bassanite, increases significantly the soil salinity (EC) in both soil units (LP and GY) and decreases pH only in GY soil. Despite differences in the content of organic matter and structural stability, both soils show no significant differences (P < 0. 01) in the <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> rates.

The surface area exposed to rain <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> was adjusted by placing rock fragments onto the surface of differently prepared soil in laboratory flumes (surface initially dry and hand cultivated or sealed due to the pre-wetting). The laboratory results showed that the eroded cumulative mass depended on the cumulative runoff, and that soil erosion was proportional to the soil surface area exposed to raindrops, in situations where an initially dry, hand cultivated and smoothed soil surface were ensured. The results showed that this relationship was controlled to a smaller extent by the soilâs initial moisture content, bulk density and soil surface characteristics. More in detail, it was observed that sediment concentrations during {{the first part of the}} erosion event were more sensitive to the initial state of the soil surface, whereas at steady state it was observed that the concentrations of eroded sediments were controlled mainly by the effective rainfall and area exposed to raindrops. Previously published field data on rain splash soil erosion were analyzed to ascertain whether the same behavior was evident under field conditions. It was found that rain <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> is in general not proportional to the area exposed. In contrast to the controlled laboratory experiments, the field experiments were characterized by non-uniform initial surface roughness, surface soil aging and heterogeneous rock fragment size and spatial distribution. An area based modification of the Hairsine and Rose (H-R) soil erosion model was employed to analyze the experimental data. The H-R model predictions agreed well with the measured sediment concentrations when high rainfall intensity and low rock fragment cover were used. Predictions were instead less accurate with low rainfall intensity and high rock fragment cover...|$|E
40|$|Raindrop impact {{can be a}} major {{contributor}} to particle mobilization for soils and other granular materials. In previous work, water repellent soils, comprised of hydrophobic particles, have been shown to exhibit greater <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> losses under multiple drop impact. However, the underlying principle differences in splash behavior between hydrophobic and hydrophilic granular surfaces have not been studied to date. In this study the effects of particle hydrophobicity on splash behaviour by a single water drop impact were examined using high-speed videography. Water drops (4 [*]mm in diameter) were dropped on beds of hydrophilic and hydrophobic glass beads (sieved range: 350 â 400 Âµm), serving as model soil particles. The drop velocity on impact was 2. 67 [*]m[*]s- 1, which corresponds to ~ 30 % of the terminal velocity of a raindrop of similar size. The resulting impact behaviour was measured in terms of the trajectories of particles ejected from the beds and their final resting positions. The response to the impacting water drop was significantly different between hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles in terms of the distance distribution, the median distance travelled by the particles and number of ejected particles. The greater ejection distances of hydrophobic particles were mainly the result of the higher initial velocities rather than differences in ejecting angles. The higher and longer ejection trajectories for hydrophobic particles, compared with hydrophilic particles, indicate that particle hydrophobicity affects <b>splash</b> <b>erosion</b> from the initial stage of rainfall erosion before a water layer may be formed by accumulating drops. The ~ 10 % increase in average splash distance for hydrophobic particles compared with hydrophilic particles suggests that particle hydrophobicity can result in greater net erosion rate, which would be amplified on sloping surfaces, for example, by ridges in ploughed agricultural soils or hillslopes following vegetation loss by clearing or wildfire...|$|E
