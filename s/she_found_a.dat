5|$|The female protagonist, Liénor, {{is notable}} {{because of her}} active nature: she herself unmasks the seneschal. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> quick {{successor}} in the active female protagonist of Tibaut's Roman de la Poire. At least one recent publication states that Liénor might make a justifiable claim to being the romance's true hero.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Leona Marshall {{returned}} to the University of Chicago, where she became a fellow at Fermi's Institute for Nuclear Studies. Working with the Chicago Pile 3 heavy water reactor, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> way to 100 percent spin polarize neutron beams, and determined the refractive index of neutrons for various materials.

5|$|Constance {{was given}} in {{marriage}} to Raymond of Poitiers in 1136. During the subsequent years, Raymond ruled Antioch while Constance gave birth to four children. After Raymond was murdered after a battle in 1149, Fulk of Anjou's son, Baldwin III of Jerusalem, assumed the regency. He tried to persuade Constance to remarry, {{but she did not}} accept his candidates. She also refused to marry a middle-aged relative of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenus. Finally, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> love interest and was married to Raynald of Châtillon, a knight from France, in 1153.|$|E
5|$|Goldman pursued an {{independent}} education on her own, however, and {{soon began to}} study the political turmoil around her, particularly the Nihilists responsible for assassinating Alexander II of Russia. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. When she read Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is to Be Done? (1863), <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> role model in the protagonist Vera, who adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing cooperative. The book enthralled Goldman and remained {{a source of inspiration}} throughout her life.|$|E
5|$|Kostova did {{extensive}} research about Eastern Europe and Vlad Țepeș. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> vampire-killing kit at the Mercer Museum, {{which included a}} pistol, silver bullets, a crucifix, a wooden stake, and powdered garlic.

5|$|When World War I began, Macmillan {{looked for}} peace {{activism}} {{on the part}} of NUWSS. Instead, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> majority of British women were in favour of helping the men win the war. Her pacifism was not at all passive—soon after hostilities broke out, she travelled to Flushing, Netherlands on a mission of mercy. By late October 1914 she was providing food for refugees from the fall of Antwerp. Macmillan signed the Open Christmas Letter, a peace-seeking exchange between women of warring nations, in late 1914.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} seven, Goldman {{moved with}} her family to the Prussian city of Königsberg (then part of the German Empire), and she {{enrolled}} in a Realschule. One teacher punished disobedient students—targeting Goldman in particular—by beating their hands with a ruler. Another teacher tried to molest his female students and was fired when Goldman fought back. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> sympathetic mentor in her German-language teacher, who loaned her books and took her to an opera. A passionate student, Goldman passed the exam for admission into a gymnasium, but her religion teacher refused to provide a certificate of good behavior and {{she was unable to}} attend.|$|E
5|$|Hepburn {{challenged}} {{herself in}} the latter half of her life, as she regularly appeared in Shakespearean stage productions and tackled a range of literary roles. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> niche playing middle-aged spinsters, such as in The African Queen (1951), a persona the public embraced. Three more Oscars came for her work in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), The Lion in Winter (1968), and On Golden Pond (1981). In the 1970s, she began appearing in television films, which became the focus of her career in later life. She remained active into old age, making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87. After a period of inactivity and ill health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96.|$|E

5|$|In Autumn La Fleche {{attempted}} {{to win a}} second Manchester Plate, but finished third to the three-year-colts Raeburn, and Isinglass. The race had been expected to lie between La Fleche and Isinglass, and their respective jockeys focused their attentions on each other, allowing Raeburn to emerge almost unseen to take the race in the closing stages. For this race, La Fleche carried a weight of 154 pounds. On 25 October <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> weight of 133 pound too much when finishing unplaced in the Cambridgeshire. She won the Lowther Stakes at Newmarket in October. On 10 November she ran in the Liverpool Autumn Cup, carrying a weight of 132 pounds and won in impressive style by one and a quarter lengths from The Prisoner. Later in November, she was beaten under 137 pounds in the Manchester November Handicap.|$|E
5|$|Nafaryus hears a rumor about Gabriel {{being the}} savior of the people. He and his family travel to Ravenskill to see him for {{themselves}} ("Lord Nafaryus"). In the Ravenskill town square, Gabriel is performing for the people when the royal family shows up. He continues playing at the emperor's request ("A Savior in the Square"), nearly bringing them all to tears ("When Your Time Has Come"). As he plays, Faythe remembers how <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> music player {{when she was a}} child and kept it a secret all her life, and as she and Gabriel stare at each other and fall in love ("Act of Faythe"). Nafaryus, though briefly moved by Gabriel's song, sees him as a threat to his rule and gives the people of the town three days to deliver their savior to him or he will destroy the town ("Three Days"). Arhys hides his brother and refuses to give him up ("Brother, Can You Hear Me?").|$|E
5|$|Tinne {{studied as}} a {{domestic}} science teacher at Edinburgh School of Cookery, between 1904 and 1906, then moved to Aigburth, Liverpool {{to live with her}} maternal uncle, William Brogden Patterson. There <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> teaching role at Liverpool Training School of Cookery & Technical College of Domestic Service, where she remained for three years until 1909. During this period Tinne became engaged to Philip Frederick Tinne, a general practitioner whose family had a history as profitable sugar merchants and ship owners. The couple married at the Welsh Presbyterian Church in Toxteth, Liverpool on 14 July 1910 and moved into a cottage in Aigburth. They had six children, Elspeth, John, Bertha, Helen, Alexine and Philip, along with another who died in infancy, and the growing family meant that they moved into a larger property in 1923 with an extension large enough for Philip's surgery {{at the rear of the}} house.|$|E

5|$|Lasarra was {{a female}} protoss {{scientist}} stationed on Kaldir when it was attacked by zerg led by Sarah Kerrigan. The protoss were defeated; Lasarra was captured during the attack on Kaldir {{at the request of}} Abathur, who wanted to experiment on her even though it was known that the protoss could not be infested. Kerrigan agreed to spare Lasarra's life until <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> use for her. During her time onboard Kerrigan's leviathan, Lasarra interacted with Kerrigan a number of times. Kerrigan tried to justify her actions on Kaldir, saying that if the protoss could contact Shakuras, Kerrigan {{would not have been able}} to survive. However, Lasarra is unconvinced, saying that self-preservation is no justification for killing so many innocents. Eventually, Kerrigan admitted she could not and would not justify her actions, stating that both the zerg and protoss were killers. Eventually, as one of the protoss ships was able to break through the zerg blockade, Lasarra was implanted with a special larva and allowed to warp in to that ship. The larva devoured her and then other lifeforms being stored on the ship, evading detection. It eventually transformed into a broodmother, Niadra, which bred a new brood that infested the ship, killing every protoss on board. Kerrigan later showed some regret over Lasarra's death, as she told Izsha that she did not enjoy having to kill her.|$|E
5|$|The infant Lennon {{started at}} his first school in November 1945— Mosspits, on Mosspits Lane, Wavertree— so <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> {{part-time}} job at a café near the school. After numerous criticisms from the Stanley family about their (still-married) daughter 'living in sin' with John Dykins, and considerable pressure from Mimi—who twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services {{to complain about the}} infant Lennon sleeping in the same bed as Julia and Dykins—she reluctantly handed the care of Lennon over to Mimi and her husband, George Smith. In July1946, Alf visited Mimi's house, 'Mendips' at 251Menlove Avenue, and took Lennon to Blackpool for a long holiday, but he was secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia and Dykins found out and followed them to Blackpool. Alf asked Julia to go with them both to New Zealand, but she refused. After a heated argument, Alf said their five-year-old child had to choose between his mother or him. He chose Alf (twice) so Julia walked away, but in the end her son (crying) followed her, although this story has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened. Alf lost contact with the family until Beatlemania, when he and his son met again.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E
