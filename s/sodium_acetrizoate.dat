50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>acetrizoate</b> (rINN, {{trade names}} Urokon, Triurol and Salpix), the {{sodium salt of}} acetrizoic acid, is a high-osmolality, water-soluble, iodine-based {{radiographic}} contrast medium no longer in clinical use.|$|E
30|$|The tri-iodobenzene {{basis of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>acetrizoate</b> {{molecule}} contains 84  % iodine {{and thus it}} displays excellent radio-opaque properties. The other positions on the aromatic ring, numbers 1, 3 and 5, are available for side chains to improve physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties such as solubility, osmolality, protein binding and tolerance [15 – 18].|$|E
30|$|The {{hydrophilic}} {{side chains}} in <b>sodium</b> <b>acetrizoate</b> are an acid group (−COOH at position 1) and an acetamido group (−NHCOCH 3 at position 3) to enhance solubility, salt formation {{and to reduce}} protein binding, {{as can be seen}} in Fig.  1. The –COOH group at position 1 is responsible for the ionicity, as it forms a cation conjugated with sodium or meglumine in solutions. Adding another acetamido group at position 5 created sodium diatrizoate [16, 17].|$|E
40|$|Numerous iodide-containing {{compounds}} {{are used}} in radiographic contrast media. Severe, un-toward reactions to these agents are of two types, cardiorespiratory collapse and, less commonly, anaphylactic reactions (Goodman and Gilman, 1965). This paper reports a case of severe laryngeal oedema which developed as an allergic reaction to sodium metrizoate 75 per cent (Triosil) administered during cardiac catheterization. Emergency laryn-gostomy was performed to prevent fatal asphyxia. Mullins et al. (1963) reported death due to asphyxia from laryngeal oedema after intravenous Hypaque (sodium diatrizoate), and Youngblood, Williams, and Tuggle (1956) a similar death after intravenous <b>sodium</b> <b>acetrizoate,</b> but survival of a patient under these circumstances has not been previously reported.
