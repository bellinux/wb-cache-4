40|$|In {{the first}} essay we study commensurability {{property}} of the directional distance function (DDF). We find that a popular DDF with a fixed directional vector is neither absolute nor ranking commensurable. Nevertheless, this function can be commensurated if the directional vector is commensurated along with the data. We identify a necessary and sufficient condition for a vector that ensures commensurability of the DDF, which helps somewhat narrowing down the key issue for this function in practice—the choice of direction of measurement. In the second paper I test the performance of smooth homogeneous bootstrap bias-correction in multi-output frontier models using hyperbolic efficiency function. I propose an approxima¬tion procedure that substantially reduces the nonparametric estimation time while sacrificing little precision compared to the most precise nonparametric alternative. The performance of the uncorrected and bias-corrected estimates is tested in samples of different sizes via Monte Carlo simulation. All techniques perform well in large samples even without correction. Both parametric and nonparametric estimators benefit from the correction regardless of the sample size. Uncorrected nonparametric estimators perform well in large and require bias-correction in smaller samples. In the small samples bias correction shows marginally better results when applied to the parametric estimator. The final paper studies the effects of nontradeable emission quota and transferable emission quota systems on the accumulation of capital and output growth in small open economies. Both types of regulation impede the growth. The transferable emission quota system has different effects {{on the development of}} quota buyers and quota sellers. While quota buyers enjoy faster growth in the both capital stock and output as compared to the nontransferable quota system, quota sellers face slower capital accumulation and economic growth. The simulation using advances in frontier modelling confirms the theoretical findings and reveals that developmental consequences for quota sellers range from a slower capital accumulation to capital <b>stock</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> It also suggests that quota sellers substitute economic production for quota revenues and economic output falls over time...|$|E

Turkey, which had an agriculture oriented economy during 1929 Depression, experienced a deflationist process caused by fallings at agricultural product prices; shrank in the economy and widely decreases at foreign trade volume. 2008 Global Crisis effected Turkish economy negatively in terms of multiple economic variables such as huge depreciations in the <b>stock</b> market, <b>shrinkages</b> in foreign trade volume, degradations in real sector and consumer confidence indexes etc...|$|R
40|$|The {{accounts}} {{of a large}} retailer showed statistical evidence that <b>shrinkage</b> (<b>stock</b> loss) was being measured with serious error. As a result, profit itself in many departments was seriously in error. These errors tended to wash out over {{large areas of the}} business, but at local level, serious mistakes could be made in commercial decisions, motivation, discipline and firing. Pattern analysis revealed a set of errors that occur only one per million transactions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether the stock wealth effect of {{consumption}} exhibits structural change(s) or behaves asymmetrically over business cycles. We first perform a general test of linearity for the behavior of aggregate consumption in response to changes in stock wealth based on Hamilton's (2001) approach. When a nonlinear relation is discovered, we move on to investigate the source(s) of this nonlinearity. We consider two types of nonlinearity: structural break and asymmetry. It is of interest to policy makers whether the sensitivity of consumption to changes in households' financial wealth shows a significant shift over time due to institutional and policy changes, and whether consumption is likely to decline more due to <b>stock</b> wealth <b>shrinkage</b> when the economy is in a downturn, as has been found in investmeconsumption, stock wealth, asymmetric effect, structural change...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2007. The {{impact of}} change and {{transformation}} on small businesses has compelled them to face a multitude of new challenges. The successful application of the selected strategies depends largely on {{an understanding of the}} predisposing and prevailing business dynamics and variables that impacts on their profitability, continued sustainability and future growth. There is increased attention that is focused on the turnover factor of small business in South Africa and this gives added need for extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis. International experience suggests that small businesses are a pervasive feature of the economic landscape in the developed world. The intensity and growing proportions of small business failure in South Africa is alarming. The problem not only presents management with new dilemmas, but also presents a challenge to researchers who are faced with the task of identifying through rational and scientifically valid processes, the underlying causes of the high failure rate amongst small businesses. Previous studies suggest that government regulations and franchised business have proven to be successful due to the infrastructure support offered by the franchisor. Since retail service station dealers operate within a highly regulated industry and within a franchised environment, this study examines the reasons for failure and success within the Retail Fuel Industry sector in South Africa. It was anticipated {{that there are a number}} of factors that influence success and failure from both within and outside the control of the fuel entrepreneur. While some researchers have identified gender, education levels and age as critical success factors, others suggested that management factors and occupational experience are key drivers. The fuel retail industry is regulated and seeks to reward efficiency through a retail fuel margin. This study provides new insights and important clues concerning the failure amongst fuel retailers. The closure of the business did not result in the physical disappearance of the establishment but rather in a transfer to new ownership. The purpose of this study is to conduct a more in-depth and comprehensive qualitative research using the case study methodology, which will investigate the causal factors that lead to the high mortality rate of fuel retailers in South Africa. The non-fuel aspect of the business comprises the shops and quick service restaurants and presents another dynamic to fuel retailing. This was investigated to fully address the research question. The case study analysis also attempted to quantify the level of support that franchisees received. There was sufficient evidence from the research findings to nullify the rival proposition that success and failure of fuel retailers was only a function of sales and volume. The case study evidence supported the research proposition that the reasons for failure and success were due to factors other than size. The 47 % per annum failure rate recorded in the study was attributed to a number of factors from both within and outside the control of the fuel entrepreneur. While gender, education levels and age were not found to be critical success factors, the ability to manage the key components of target costs was critical. The management of manpower costs and the efficient application thereof was found to be the most significant variable in the cost build up and differentiated successful and failed retailers. There was also evidence of substantial imposed costs from both the regulatory environment and the franchisor. The monthly adjustment of fuel prices had an impact on working capital and generally resulted in net stock price losses. Both these variables were not factored into the calculation of the retail fuel margin resulting in the understating of the true costs. The loose regulatory environment also marginalised the fuel retailer. It was found that the oil companies optimised their fuel delivery regimes at the expense of the small business owner through the automatic replenishment system of wet stocks, controlled through a central ordering system. While, wet stock control mechanism was in place for the fuel business, the non-fuel business received limited support for <b>stock</b> and <b>shrinkage</b> management. The case study evidence also supported the retailers view on the inadequate level of business support and training. This was an important finding and such poor orientation negatively influenced the quality of the due diligence checks and business valuation. In many cases, the budgeting was optimistic with little or no recourse for remedial action leading to eventual failure. Statistical analysis indicated that the two groups differed significantly with regard to the mean difference between Shop sales and Budgeted Shop sales. It appears that in the case of the success group that the shop sales mean was much higher than budgeted mean, while in the case of the failure group the mean was lower than budgeted mean. Failure to achieve the shop budgets did contribute to failure. Important recommendations are made based on the case study findings. This includes the establishment of a central training unit, an industry valuation model and a more relevant regulatory regime aimed at removing the imbalances between the oil company and the retailer in terms of delivery and payment methodology...|$|R
