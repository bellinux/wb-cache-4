2500|$|On Monday 30 October 2006 (the first {{business}} day following the handing {{down of the}} Court of Appeal's judgment on Friday 27 October 2006), the Search Division of the EPO in charge of establishing a <b>search</b> <b>report</b> for the European patent application issued a declaration under [...] (now [...] ) that a search could not be established. The declaration indicates that the EPO search examiner is {{of the opinion that}} Macrossan's application contains nothing of technical merit, but only commonplace technical features (i.e. a computer) for implementing a business method. As a consequence, no meaningful search was considered to be possible. Before a substantive examination report was issued, the application was deemed to be withdrawn in October 2009 after Macrossan failed to pay a maintenance fee.|$|E
50|$|In patent law, a <b>search</b> <b>report</b> is {{a report}} {{established}} by a patent office, which mentions documents which may {{be taken into consideration}} in deciding whether the invention to which a patent application relates is patentable. The documents mentioned in the <b>search</b> <b>report</b> usually form part of the prior art.|$|E
5000|$|Along {{with the}} <b>search</b> <b>report,</b> a search opinion is also established. The search opinion and the <b>search</b> <b>report</b> form {{together}} the so-called extended European <b>search</b> <b>report.</b> Before April 1, 2010, {{a response to}} the search opinion was optional. Currently however, under new Rule 70a EPC, a reply to the search opinion is mandatory, within six months [...] "after the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report" [...] (which is also the time limit for requesting examination). If no reply is filed to the search opinion, the application is deemed to be withdrawn. The search opinion is therefore a conventional office action with a given time period to respond.|$|E

40|$|Context. Systematic reviews play an {{important}} role in evidence based health promotion. The search and selection methods are at the heart of a systematic review. ^ Objective. To evaluate the <b>search</b> methods, <b>search</b> <b>reporting,</b> and selection methods of reviews of physical activity interventions to prevent obesity. ^ Methods. Review articles focusing on physical activity for obesity prevention were retrieved from a list of sources suggested by Cochrane Public Health Group for health promotion/public health reviews. The <b>search</b> methods, <b>search</b> <b>reporting,</b> and selection methods of each review will be evaluated using checklists developed from Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Systematic Reviews of Health Promotion and Public Health Interventions: Guidelines. <b>Search</b> <b>reporting</b> was also be evaluated using another checklist known as STARLITE (Sampling strategy, Type of studies, Approaches, Range of years, Limits, Inclusion and exclusions, Terms used, and Electronic sources). ^ Results. 31 articles were evaluated with the following principal findings: most (64 %) of the reviews reported 2 or less of the 5 required Cochrane Handbook search approaches; number of databases searched ranged from 1 to 8 (median of 4); only 23 % of the articles provided a complete search strategy; the average search precision was 1. 12 %; and most (61 %) of the reviews did not report any element of the selection methods. ^ Conclusion. The reviews evaluated ranged widely in the depth of the search and level of clarity in search and screening processes. When complete methods are not provided, it is difficult to evaluate the research. While standards for <b>searching,</b> <b>search</b> <b>reporting,</b> and screening procedures are available, awareness and application of the standards has yet to take place in the area of reviewing physical activity interventions with focus on preventing obesity. ...|$|R
5000|$|After filing, either {{systematically}} or, in some jurisdictions, upon request, {{a search}} {{is carried out}} for the patent application. The purpose of the search is to reveal prior art which may be relevant to the patentability of the alleged invention (that is, relevant to what is claimed, the [...] "claimed subject-matter"). The <b>search</b> <b>report</b> is published, generally with the application 18 months after the priority date of the application, and as such is a public document. The <b>search</b> <b>report</b> is useful to the applicant {{to determine whether the}} application should be pursued or if there is prior art which prevents the grant of a useful patent, in which case the application may be abandoned before the applicant incurs further expense. The <b>search</b> <b>report</b> is also useful for the public and the competitors, so that they may have an idea of the scope of protection which may be granted to the pending patent application.|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} <b>search</b> <b>report</b> {{can help}} the applicant decide {{whether it would be}} worthwhile seeking national protection, and if so, in how many countries, as fees and other expenses, including translation costs, must be paid to enter the national phase in each country. Yet another advantage of filing a PCT application under the PCT is that many national patent authorities will rely on the international <b>search</b> <b>report</b> (although the PCT does not obligate them to do so) instead of performing a prior art search themselves, and the applicant may thus be able to save search fees.|$|E

50|$|The {{examination}} of patent applications may either be {{conducted at the}} same time as the search (as in the US, where a <b>search</b> <b>report</b> is not issued), or at a later date after the Applicant has requested examination (as, for example, under the EPC).|$|E

5000|$|Article 123(1) EPC {{provides}} {{the right for}} an applicant, in proceedings before the European Patent Office (EPO), to amend its European patent application and for a patent proprietor (during opposition proceedings) the right to amend its European patent. This must however be done {{in accordance with the}} Implementing Regulations, considering that the applicant is given [...] "at least one opportunity to amend the application of his own volition." [...] According to the Implementing Regulations, amendments before receiving the (extended) European <b>search</b> <b>report</b> are generally not allowed, amendments are allowed in response to the extended European <b>search</b> <b>report</b> (i.e., in response to the communication under [...] ), and amendments are also allowed shortly after entry into European phase of a PCT application (namely, in response to the communication under [...] ), but formally any further amendment is subject to the consent of the Examining Division.|$|E
5000|$|If, when {{carrying}} out a search, the search division considers that the application lacks unity (i.e., it doesn't meet the provisions of Article 82), a partial <b>search</b> <b>report</b> is established.

Background: Identifying literature for a systematic review requires searching a variety of sources. The main sources are typically bibliographic databases. Web searching using search engines and websites {{may be used to}} identify grey literature. <b>Searches</b> should be <b>reported</b> in order to ensure transparency and reproducibility. This study assesses the <b>reporting</b> of web <b>searching</b> for systematic reviews carried out by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme (UK). The study also makes recommendations about <b>reporting</b> web <b>searching</b> for systematic reviews in order to achieve a reasonable level of transparency and reproducibility. Methods: Systematic reviews were identified by searching the HTA database via the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) website. Systematic reviews were included in the study if they made reference to searching the web using either search engines or websites. A data-extraction checklist was designed to record how web <b>searching</b> was <b>reported.</b> The checklist recorded whether a systematic review reported: the names of search engines or websites; the dates they were searched; the search terms; the results of the searches; and, in the case of websites, whether a URL was reported. Results: 554 HTA reports published between January 2004 and December 2013 were identified. 300 of these reports are systematic reviews, of which 108 <b>report</b> web <b>searching</b> using either a search engine or a website. Overall, the systematic reviews assessed in the study exhibit a low standard of web <b>search</b> <b>reporting.</b> In the majority of cases, the only details reported are the names of websites (n[*]=[*] 54) or search engines (n[*]=[*] 33). A small minority (n[*]=[*] 6) exhibit the highest standard of web <b>search</b> <b>reporting.</b> Conclusions: Most web <b>search</b> <b>reporting</b> in systematic reviews carried out on the UK HTA programme is not detailed enough to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Transparency of reporting could be improved by adhering to a reporting standard such as the standard detailed in the CRD systematic reviews methods guidance. Reproducibility is harder to achieve due to the frequency of changes to websites and search engines...|$|R

In order to have a basis for future work, this paper gives statistics and analysis by categories of the relevant documents cited in 159 PCT international <b>search</b> <b>reports</b> which the CPO finished in 1994 and 1995, including countries, number of documents and technical fields. The conclusions are as follows: 1. (1) the technical fields of the majority of Chinese patents seeking protection outside China in 1994 and 1995 claimed medical apparatus and instruments, and health care medicines; 2. (2) at present, the starting year for search files should be fixed temporarily at 1920; 3. (3) in PCT international <b>search</b> <b>reports</b> made in the CPO, US patents were cited most often, followed by Chinese documents, then European documents. Japanese documents were fourth and PCT documents fifth; and 4. (4) the most common languages used by the examiners carrying out these searches were English and Chinese. ...|$|R
