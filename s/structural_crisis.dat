25|$|In the 1960s, {{signs of}} a <b>structural</b> <b>crisis</b> in the Soviet system began to emerge. Azerbaijan's crucial oil {{industry}} lost its relative importance in the Soviet economy, partly because of a shift of oil production to {{other regions of the}} Soviet Union and partly because of the depletion of known oil resources accessible from land, while offshore production was not deemed cost effective. As a result, Azerbaijan had the lowest rate of growth in productivity and economic output among the Soviet republics, with the exception of Tajikistan. Ethnic tensions, particularly between Armenians and Azerbaijanis began to grow, but violence was suppressed. In an attempt to end the growing <b>structural</b> <b>crisis,</b> the government in Moscow appointed Heidar Aliyev as the first secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan in 1969. Aliyev temporarily improved economic conditions and promoted alternative industries to the declining oil industry, such as cotton. He also consolidated the republic's ruling elite, which now consisted almost entirely of ethnic Azerbaijanis, thus reverting the previous trends of sblizheniye. In 1982 Aliyev was made a member of the Communist Party's Politburo in Moscow. In 1987, when Perestroika was implemented, he was forced to retire by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, whose reform policies he opposed.|$|E

Second, thus, crises should be seen as signs that indicate that economic and social institutional matrix is at fault, which requires new “solutions”.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} current state of {{comparative}} genocide theorizing, focusing on theories that attempt to account for the causes of genocide and the processes of genocidal killing. The literature is divided into three broad categories, based on the relative weight given to (a) individual or group agency, (b) structural factors, or (c) processes of identity construction in accounting for the origins and unfolding of genocidal destruction. The discussion of agency- oriented approaches focuses on theories that suggest that genocide is driven, in terms of decision making and perpetration, by elite decision makers, front-line perpetrators, and societal behavior. The literature on structural approaches is broken down into theories that stress the importance of culture, institutional organizations, societal cleavages, <b>structural</b> <b>crises,</b> regime type, modernity, and ideology. The final section reviews the literature on processes of collective identity construction. The article suggests throughout and in conclusion that although comparative genocide theorizing {{has come a long way}} in proposing a number of different explanations for the onset of genocide and the nature of genocidal processes, more work needs to be done with respect to the precise operationalization and testing of theories according to more rigorous compara- tive methodological practices...|$|R

40|$|Departing {{from the}} renewed {{interest}} within economic history and neo-Schumpeterian perspectives on growth and economic transformation, we will suggest {{a theoretical framework}} for analyzing long term regional economic growth and transformation. Emphasis {{will be given to}} different driving forces and their various roles over time, lead-lag relations between industries and how divergence and convergence between regions shift cyclically as consequences of technological change, market integration and economic growth. We claim that systemic approaches in general have been neglected in regional science in favor of "neoregionalism" {{in the sense that the}} study of regional growth has been focusing for years on regional innovation systems and cluster theories without any regard to systemic relations at all. Using detailed time series data and applying a systemic approach we will follow Swedish regions from the <b>structural</b> <b>crises</b> in the mid 1970 s to the starting point of the present financial crises. Our results suggest that there are time lags as well as systemic spatial asymmetries between industries and regions leading to changing patterns of divergence and convergence in the regional system. Furthermore, there are indications that the regional disparities between centre and periphery have increased compared to the situation in the mid 1970 s.

50|$|The {{theory of}} the Information Age is deeply rooted in {{organization}} theory. This {{may come as a}} surprise since Manuel Castells is perhaps more readily associated with either the study of the Internet, cities and regions, or social movements. There are two points to be made about the parallels with organization theory. First, Castells sees himself as picking up Max Weber's mantle in both his use of historical sociology and in his style of theory. Second, the informational economy is not the direct result of the rise of new ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies). Rather, it is the convergence of those technologies with an older and autonomous process of network forms of organizing with their focus on flexibility and adaptability as key modes of organizing. This is a shift that organization theorists have been discussing and documenting since the appearance of open systems perspectives in the 1960s. Castells documents how the 1970s marked a shift towards new organizational forms; these changes were parallel to the rise of new information technologies, but not dependent on them because the changes emerged to deal with economic uncertainties rooted in the increasing globalization of trade and the <b>structural</b> <b>crises</b> of capitalism in the 1970s; the network enterprise is focused on leaner production and altered relations to labor.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{negative}} consequences of the brain drain of sub-Saharan African health workers for source countries are well documented and include understaffed facilities, decreased standards of care and higher workloads. However, studies suggest that, if migrated health workers eventually return to their home countries, this may lead to beneficial effects following the transfer of their acquired skills and knowledge (brain gain). The present study aims to explore the factors influencing the intentions for return migration of sub-Saharan African health workers who emigrated to Austria and Belgium, and gain further insight into the potential of circular migration. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 27 sub-Saharan African health workers in Belgium and Austria were conducted. Results: As mentioned by the respondents, the main barriers for returning were family, <b>structural</b> <b>crises</b> in the source country, and insecurity. These barriers overrule the perceived drivers, which were nearly all pull factors and emotion driven. Despite {{the fact that only}} a minority plans to return permanently, many wish to return regularly to work in the healthcare sector or to {{contribute to the development of}} their source country. Conclusion: As long as safety and structural stability cannot be guaranteed in source countries, the number of return migrants is likely to remain low. National governments and regional organizations could play a role in facilitating the engagement of migrant health workers in the development of the healthcare system in source countries...|$|R

This law also established an [...] "economic committee" [...] charged with closely monitoring the economic situation. A second law opened a budget credit of 250 million francs to finance extraordinary works in the general interest. In 1977, faced with the worsening of the steel crisis, {{the government}} created an additional body for dialogue and consultation: a Tripartite Coordination Committee, including representatives of the government, employers, and the trade unions. The Tripartite conference for the steel industry came to a first agreement, concluded on 19 March 1979 and included in the law of 8 June 1979, on restructuring and modernisation of the steel industry.

The Tripartite made it possible to use consensus to manage a <b>structural</b> <b>crisis</b> which was becoming a problem of national solidarity. Two measures in particular allowed heavy industry to reduce its headcount without massive layoffs: on the one hand, the creation of a [...] "Division Anti-Crise" [...] - the DAC - employing the workers who were the victims of rationalisation efforts, on the other hand, the installation of an obligatory pre-retirement at 57 years for steel industry workers.

5000|$|Bracher {{argued that}} the system of [...] "presidential government" [...] was {{intended}} to and {{had the effect of}} weakening democracy, and that in no way was [...] "presidential government" [...] forced on Hindenburg and his Chancellors by an unmanageable crisis. Bracher's thesis that Heinrich Brüning and even more so, his successor Franz von Papen had gutted German democracy involved him in a dispute with Werner Conze, a prominent Nazi historian under the Third Reich who emerged as a leading conservative historian in West Germany in the 1950s. In a series of articles published in the 1950s-60s, Conze argued that by 1929-1930 that German politics had become so dysfunctional that Hindenburg had no other choice, but to reluctantly bring in [...] "presidential government" [...] as the only to provide Germany with any sort of government, and that Brüning's governing via Article 48 was only a temporary measure intended to save democracy from the crisis caused by the Great Depression. In reply, Bracher wrote a series of article documenting that the plans for [...] "presidential government" [...] went back much to 1926 at least, and {{argued that the}}re was no unmanageable crisis with parliamentary government in 1930 that made [...] "presidential government" [...] unavoidable. Bracher forcefully argued that was no <b>structural</b> <b>crisis</b> in 1929-30 so severe that Hindenburg had to turn to [...] "presidential government" [...] as Conze was claiming, instead arguing that Hindenburg, his kamarilla, and the Reichswehr had been seeking long before the Great Depression to do away with democracy. In this regard, Bracher pointed out that General Kurt von Schleicher and Heinrich Brüning had worked out the plan for a [...] "presidential government" [...] by April 1929, and it was only Hindenburg's desire to have the government of Hermann Müller pass the Young Plan, which its turn was delayed by the Young Plan referendum of November 1929, that gave Müller almost an extra year in office.|$|E
40|$|The 1980 s {{and early}} 1990 s were {{characterized}} by sweeping, radical neoliberal, monetarist-inspired economic reforms designed to correct fi nancial or <b>structural</b> <b>crises.</b> Latin American countries initiated the wave, followed by Eastern Europe and the former USSR, although the timing, scope, and policies varied. Often one reads accounts of friends and foes of reform lined up to do battle in domestic and international alliances. However, reform processes and outcomes do not always follow the formula of reformers versus conservatives; {{there is more to}} the balance of power than these all-too-common accounts would suggest. Industrial managers in the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia and business elites in Argentina initially accepted reforms that would soon harm them. Soviet industrial managers, with their hands on levers of Soviet and early post-Soviet production, did not wholeheartedly embrace increasingly radical economic reforms, but neither did they reject them, or prepare for the uncertainty and systemic shocks that marketization would bring. Unlike younger entrepreneurs, they did not play games of speculation to accumulate capital; rather, they played on the margins of the law to improve gains and positions somewhat. However the extent of these practices didn’t come close to guarding them against what would come. In Argentina, business elites themselves initiated economic reforms that they thought would bring them the opportunity to participate in La bo ra to ri um. ...|$|R
5000|$|The approach, which {{incorporates}} social scientific {{methods such as}} {{the recently}} evolved field of economic history into general history, was pioneered by Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre in the Interwar period. The approach was carried on by Fernand Braudel {{in the second part}} of the century: Braudel took stock of the current status of social studies in crisis, foundering under the weight of their own successes, in an article in 1958, [...] "Histoire et sciences sociales: La longue durée". Among the works which Braudel remarked on as examples of the longue durée was Alphonse Dupront's study of the long-standing idea in Western Europe of a crusade, which extended across diverse European societies far beyond the last days of the actual crusades, and among spheres of thought with a long life he noted Aristotelian science. In the longue durée of economic history, beyond, or beneath, the cycles and <b>structural</b> <b>crises,</b> lie [...] "old attitudes of thought and action, resistant frameworks dying hard, at times against all logic." [...] In this sense the history of the longue durée that informs Braudel's two masterworks offers a contrast to the archives-directed history that arose at the end of the 19th century and a return to the broader views of the earlier generation of Jules Michelet, Leopold von Ranke, Jacob Burckhardt or Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges.|$|R
