40|$|In {{this work}} we made an {{elaboration}} of {{theoretical and practical}} aspects in manifestation, measurement and assessment of balance in 7 year old children, {{as well as the}} representation of balance in PE contents in national PHE curriculum for second grade students. Presented knowledge has been obtained in a research realized on a sample of 123 male examinees, 7 year old children, second grade students in 5 primary schools in Skopje, Macedonia. Using adequate statistical methods we determined the manifestation of balance in children latent motor space, characteristics of test used for estimation of balance as well as norms for following and assessment of children`s achievements in suggested tests as a foundation for following and assessment in PE teaching process and creation of final grade for PHE. Following tests were used: Walking on upturned <b>Swedish</b> <b>bench</b> (RAOSK), Standing on a bench in width (RASKS) and Standing on a bench in length (RASKD). Obtained results point out a great variability of results, high coefficients for reliability and satisfactory validity of applied tests. According to this results, the test Walking on upturned <b>Swedish</b> <b>bench</b> (RAOSK), is recommended for future use for estimation of dynamic balance, while the test Standing on a bench in width (RASKS) has best metric characteristics and it is recommended for future use for evaluation of static balance in 7 year old children...|$|E
40|$|A {{sample of}} 60 {{respondents}} {{was drawn from}} the population of students of the third grade of primary school in Nis, aged nine ± 6 months, male, who attend regular physical education classes. Subsample of 30 respondents worked on speed and strength development through elementary games at additional physical education classes (experimental group), while the control group had only regular physical education classes defined by primary school curriculum. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effects of work on speed and strength development within the framework of extra physical education classes in the third grade. Tests for the assessment of speed implied six tests: running at 20, 40 and 60 meters, hand tapping, foot tapping and feet tapping on the wall; tests for the assessment of strength implied five tests: push-ups, back lifting, squats, trunk lifting on <b>Swedish</b> <b>bench</b> and trunk lifting for 30 seconds. For determining the effects multivariate analysis of covariance was applied. The results indicated statistically significant effect of the work on the experimental group in both motor dimensions.   </p...|$|E
