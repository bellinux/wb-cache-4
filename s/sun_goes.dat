5|$|On {{the planet}} Krypton, using {{evidence}} {{provided to the}} Council by scientist Jor-El, the attempted insurrectionists General Zod, Ursa, and Non are sentenced to the Phantom Zone. For this, Zod swears revenge on Jor-El and his family. Jor-El, despite his eminence, is unable to convince the Council that Krypton will soon be destroyed when its red supergiant <b>sun</b> <b>goes</b> supernova. To save his infant son, Kal-El, Jor-El launches him in a spaceship to Earth, a planet with a suitable atmosphere where Kal-El's dense molecular structure will give him superhuman powers. Shortly after the launch, Krypton's sun explodes, destroying the planet.|$|E

In the season finale, the events of 100, 500, 1000 and one million {{years into the future}} are shown, depicting Babylon 5's lasting influence throughout history. Among the events shown are the political aftermath of the 2261 civil war, a subsequent nuclear war on Earth involving a new totalitarian government in 2762, the resulting fall of Earth into a pre-industrial society, the loss and restoration of humanity's knowledge of space travel and the final evolution of mankind into energy beings similar to the Vorlons, after which Earth's <b>sun</b> <b>goes</b> nova.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, the Imperial Daleks succeed, {{not knowing}} that the Seventh Doctor had {{inserted}} a booby trap into the Hand's programming. When Davros activates it, Skaro's <b>sun</b> <b>goes</b> supernova, and both the Dalek homeworld (in the future) and the Imperial Dalek fleet are destroyed. Davros, however, apparently escapes his flagship's destruction in an escape pod. The Renegade Supreme Dalek self-destructs when the Doctor informs it that it has failed and {{is the last of}} its kind. Remembrance of the Daleks marked the last on-screen appearance of the Daleks {{in the context of the}} programme until 2005, save for charity specials like Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death and the use of Dalek voices in the Doctor Who television movie.|$|E

Polls conducted by Gallup in the 1990s found that 16% of Germans, 18% of Americans and 19% of Britons hold that the Sun revolves around the Earth. A study conducted in 2005 by Jon D. Miller of Northwestern University, {{an expert in the}} public understanding of science and technology, found that about 20%, or one in five, of American adults believe that the Sun orbits the Earth. According to 2011 VTSIOM poll, 32% of Russians believe that the Sun orbits the Earth.|$|E

Meanwhile among the Others, Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) orders Colleen (Paula Malcomson) to put {{together}} a team and capture Sayid's boat. Her team avoids Sayid and Jin, and instead sneaks aboard the boat, where they encounter Sun below deck. Sun accidentally shoots Colleen in the abdomen and narrowly manages to escape overboard.|$|E

The pre-chorus has a sing-rap section in which Gomez delivers the lyrics in a thick British accent.

[...] "Whiplash" [...] received mixed to positive reviews. While some critics called it one of the standout tracks of When the <b>Sun</b> <b>Goes</b> Down, others dismissed its rap sections and lyrics.

500|$|The tour {{to support}} the album {{was to be a}} {{farewell}} tour, although Lynott was not convinced that this {{would be the end of}} the band. Sykes wanted to continue, although Gorham had had enough. The tour was successful, and some concerts were recorded to compile a live album. Partway into the tour, many of Thin Lizzy's past guitarists were invited onstage to contribute to some of the songs they had originally recorded, the only exception being Snowy White. The album was released in October 1983 as Life, which included an older performance of [...] "Renegade" [...] featuring White, and reached no. 29 in the UK.

Its title track, co-written by Neil Thrasher, Jason Sellers, and Michael Dulaney, was previously recorded by Kenny Chesney on his 2004 album When the <b>Sun</b> <b>Goes</b> Down. Gentry told the Edmonton Sun that Some People Change [...] "is based more on family issues, {{the love of the}} family, the love of neighbors, relationships", and said that the title track [...] "is about being able to challenge your inner demons and the things that can bring people down, alcoholism, or hatred or racism." [...] Montgomery Gentry's version of the song peaked at number 7, followed by the two-week number 1 hit [...] "Lucky Man" [...] and the number 3 [...] "What Do Ya Think About That". In 2008, [...] "Lucky Man" [...] was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, the duo's first Grammy nomination.|$|E
500|$|... "Whiplash" [...] is a dance {{song with}} {{influences}} of electro. It features a heavy usage of synthesizers, which {{were compared to}} those in Christina Aguilera's [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] (2010). During the pre-chorus, there is a sing-rap section in which Gomez delivers several phrases in a thick British accent, before the pulsating chorus begins.

According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, it is written in the key of D minor. The song runs through a shuffle beat and maintains a tempo of 138 beat per minute. Gomez's vocal range spans from the high-tone of A3 to the lower register of B4.
