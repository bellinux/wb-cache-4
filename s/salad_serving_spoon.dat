5000|$|Before about 1700, it was {{customary}} {{for people}} of European descent to bring their own spoons to the table. Spoons were carried as personal property {{in much the same}} way as people today carry wallets, key rings, etc. From about 1700 the place setting became popular, and with it the [...] "table-spoon", [...] "table-fork" [...] and [...] "table-knife". Around the same time the tea-spoon and dessert-spoon first appeared, and the table-spoon was reserved for eating soup. The 18th century witnessed a proliferation of different sorts of spoons, including the mustard-spoon, salt-spoon, coffee-spoon, and soup-spoon. In the late 19th century UK, the dessert-spoon and soup-spoon began to displace the table-spoon as the primary implement for eating from a bowl, at which point the name [...] "table-spoon" [...] took on a secondary meaning as a much larger <b>serving</b> <b>spoon.</b> At the time the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary was published in 1928, [...] "tablespoon" [...] (which by then was no longer hyphenated) still had two definitions in the UK: the original definition (eating spoon) and the new definition (<b>serving</b> <b>spoon).</b>|$|R
