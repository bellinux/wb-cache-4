50|$|All early <b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing, Chris Adams and Graham Smith albums are {{available}} on CD (Ozit Morpheus Records). Some live material and some hard to find tracks and outtakes appear on a German CD called Dischotomy with some alternate takes and rare material not found anywhere else. There are several BBC transcription discs of <b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing live performances featuring both line-ups and two of these sets are on a German live bootleg CD called It's a Game.|$|R
50|$|<b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing are a folk {{rock band}} from Scotland, {{originally}} {{formed in the}} 1960s and led by husband and wife Chris Adams and Pauline Adams. The band also featured the electric violin of Graham Smith.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, {{the band}} {{released}} Moments of Truth, their first studio album in over 30 years, featuring twelve new Adams songs. April 2009 brought the Americana-tinged Songs From Another Country (released for contractual reasons as <b>String</b> <b>Driven)</b> on Backshop Records. The new material was first heard publicly at Fifestock in March 2009 {{and a new}} website stringdriventhing.co.uk was launched {{at the same time}} as the album release. In 2010, the Adamses gigged with original member John Mannion to celebrate the first album's 40th anniversary. As 2012 was the 40th anniversary of <b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing's signing to Charisma and touring with Genesis, the band did some English gigs with Graham Smith and Pauline Adams.|$|R
50|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} {{during a period}} of line-up change for Hammill's band Van der Graaf Generator. It features VdGG drummer Guy Evans, VdGG's new recruit Graham Smith (formerly of <b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing) on violin, and the return of VdGG's bass player from 1969 to 1970, Nic Potter.|$|R

2500|$|Irish {{musician}} Fiachra Trench provided string arrangements, {{for example}} on [...] "Sweet Marie", {{on which he}} used one bank of violins and two viola sections. Trench also contributed occasional bass guitar, while Kim Beacon of <b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing sang backing vocals. Again, none of the band members could recall which song(s) Beacon appeared on. Robertson claimed that Beacon was only used because Frankie Miller was unavailable.|$|R
5000|$|Everett {{appeared}} in the line up of Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages (after the departure of Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page). [...] Other associations include Alan Lancaster, David Knopfler, Bob Henrit from The Kinks, Sam Kelly, Jim Russell, Carl Palmer, Gerry McAvoy and Brendan O'Neil from the Rory Gallagher Band, Jim Leverton, Kim Beacon from <b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing, Ian Paice, Gordon Huntley and Bobby Millar an early member of Supertramp.|$|R
5000|$|<b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing put out {{a number}} of singles on the Charisma label, some of which are not on any of the vinyl albums but appear as bonus tracks on Ozit Records CDs. Two of these are the Chris Adams {{compositions}} [...] "It's a Game" [...] and [...] "Eddie". [...] "It's A Game" [...] was covered by the Bay City Rollers in 1977 and became a chart hit in the US, Japan and Germany. Chris and Pauline Adams {{put out a}} few singles on the Charisma label both as [...] "Chris and Pauline Adams" [...] and just [...] "Adams". The b-side of their first single, [...] "The City at Night", features Graham Smith. Colin Wilson went on to put out a solo folk album called Cloudburst on the Tabitha label which is also hard to find and has recently been reissued. The Chris Adams/Graham Smith <b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing line up has reconvened on several occasions, most notably in 1991, 2001 and in 2004 which also saw an appearance from Pauline Adams.|$|R

5000|$|The label's most {{successful}} acts were Genesis, Peter Gabriel, Julian Lennon, and Monty Python. It also released material by Van der Graaf Generator, The Nice, Lindisfarne [...] and Alan Hull, Hawkwind, The Alan Parsons Project, Clifford T. Ward, <b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing, Jack The Lad, Audience, Vivian Stanshall, Brand X, Sir John Betjeman, Malcolm McLaren and Afraid of Mice. 1970s solo albums of Peter Hammill, Tony Banks and Steve Hackett were also on Charisma Records.|$|R
50|$|De Vito's version {{presented}} an acoustic-guitar and <b>string</b> <b>driven</b> theme {{as opposed to}} the strong guitar and drums of the original. It received very limited airplay on mainstream radio stations. Despite this, it managed to become the first independently recorded and released single to debut at #1 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was also the best selling independent Australian single for 2004. The release stayed in the Top 5 for over a month and was certified platinum for shipments of over 70,000 units.|$|R
50|$|After 15 {{years of}} silence, Chris Adams {{released}} a solo album, The Damage, in 1991 and subsequently reformed <b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing for a German tour, the Berlin leg {{of which was}} released on Ozit as $uicide, Live in Berlin. Variations of that band toured sporadically throughout the 1990s, but since 2001 the lineup has stabilised, with Andy Allan on bass, Dick Drake on drums and either George Tucker or Chris' son Robin Adams on guitar, with Pauline Adams and Graham Smith occasionally joining them in concert.|$|R
50|$|It was {{the last}} album {{recorded}} by the classic line-up of the band until their 2005 reunion: Hugh Banton and David Jackson departed in 1976 and 1977 respectively. Banton's departure owed to financial troubles and his then-recent marriage, but he stayed to finish touring commitments. Jackson continued with Peter Hammill and Guy Evans to rehearse with the new line-up in January 1977, which featured returning bassist Nic Potter and newcomer violinist Graham Smith (of Scottish folk-rock act <b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing), but left before the next tour.|$|R
5000|$|On the disc, {{they covered}} an {{unsuccessful}} 1973 single by <b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing, [...] "It's a Game" [...] {{to give them}} their final UK Top 20 hit (#16 in May 1977). Oddly enough, this single provided them with their highest-charting German hit, reaching No. 4 in the same year. The follow-up [...] "You Made Me Believe in Magic" [...] could only make No. 34 in July in the UK and No. 10 in the US, but this would be their final major success there too.|$|R
40|$|We {{find the}} {{spectrum}} P(w) dw of the gravitational wave background {{produced in the}} early universe in string theory. We work in the framework of <b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Cosmology, whose scale factors are computed with the low-energy effective string equations as well as selfconsistent solutions of General Relativity with a gas of strings as source. The scale factor evolution is described by an early <b>string</b> <b>driven</b> inflationary stage with an instantaneous transition to a radiation dominated stage and successive matter dominated stage. This is an expanding string cosmology always running on positive proper cosmic time. A careful treatment of the scale factor evolution and involved transitions is made. A full prediction on the power spectrum of gravitational waves without any free-parameters is given. We study and show explicitly the effect of the dilaton field, characteristic to this kind of cosmologies. We compute the spectrum for the same evolution description with three differents approachs. Some features of gravitational wave spectra, as peaks and asymptotic behaviours, are found direct consequences of the dilaton involved and not only of the scale factor evolution. A comparative analysis of different treatments, solutions and compatibility with observational bounds or detection perspectives is made. Comment: LaTeX, 50 pages with 2 figures.

In order to design this device, a new mechanism is put forward, which is fully parallel and <b>string</b> <b>driven.</b> It achieves kinematic and dynamic isotropy. From the kinematic and dynamic analysis, the conditions for obtaining the best performance results are derived. These form the basis for the design and lead to a high performance device, which has wide bandwidth, low friction and which is free from backlash. The input and output is fully decoupled, which lead to simple control...|$|R
5000|$|For this album, bassist Nic Potter {{returned}} to the band, having left in 1970, and violinist Graham Smith (<b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing), also joined the line-up, {{in place of the}} two members who had departed in the aftermath of their previous album, World Record (October 1976): organist Hugh Banton and saxophonist/flautist David Jackson. This considerably modified the band's sound. Officially, the band's name was shortened to just [...] "Van der Graaf" [...] for this album and the live album Vital (July 1978), that followed, but contemporaneous Charisma Records promotional materials used both the full and shortened name.|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{harmonic}} elastic <b>string</b> <b>driven</b> through a continuous random potential above the depinning threshold. The velocity exponent beta = 0. 33 (2) is calculated. We observe a crossover in the roughness exponent zeta from the critical value 1. 26 to the asymptotic (large force) value of 0. 5. We calculate directly the velocity correlation function {{and the corresponding}} correlation length exponent nu = 1. 29 (5), which obeys the scaling relation nu = 1 /(2 -zeta), and agrees with the finite-size-scaling exponent of fluctuations in the critical force. The velocity correlation function is non-universal at short distances. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures. corrected references and typo...|$|R
5|$|In December 1976, {{following}} World Record, Banton quit, {{quickly followed}} by Jackson in February 1977. Nic Potter returned to replace Banton, {{and in a}} typically eccentric move Jackson {{was replaced by a}} violinist, Graham Smith (formerly of Charisma folk-rock band <b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing). This line-up produced the album The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome (September 1977). The band also shortened its name to Van der Graaf. Charles Dickie then joined the band on cello, documented on the live double-album Vital, which saw a brief reunion with Jackson. By the time Vital was released, in July 1978, the band had already split, because of lack of record company support in the United States and financial difficulties.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a one dimensional elastic string {{as a set}} of massless beads interacting through springs characterized by anisotropic elastic constants. The <b>string,</b> <b>driven</b> by an external force, moves in a medium with quenched disorder. We present evidence that the consideration of longitudinal fluctuations leads to nonlinear behavior in the equation of motion which is kinematically generated by the motion of the string. The strength of the nonlinear effects depends on the anisotropy of the medium and the distance from the depinning transition. On the other hand the consideration of restricted solid on solid conditions imposed to the growth of the string leads to a nonlinear term in the equation of motion with a diverging coefficient at the depinning transition.

50|$|<b>String</b> <b>Driven</b> Thing {{formed in}} Glasgow in 1967 as a three part harmony folk band with the Adamses and guitarist John Mannion. After paying their dues on the Scottish folk circuit {{they put out}} an eponymous album on the {{independent}} Concord label (copies of which are collectable and difficult to find) although {{a long way from}} their later Charisma label output. The group moved to London in 1972 and Chris Adams began to steer the band towards the electric folk-rock genre where his song writing abilities, which often feature hard-bitten and bitter observations capturing the harsher side of life, would be seen to better effect. By 1972 he had recruited classically trained violinist Graham Smith and guitarist Colin Wilson on bass, but soon afterwards Mannion left, citing musical differences.|$|R
50|$|Harmonics {{are most}} often played by lightly placing a finger on a string at a nodal point {{of one of the}} overtones at the moment when the <b>string</b> is <b>driven.</b> The finger {{immediately}} damps all overtones that do not have a node near the location touched.

We show that the computed value of the thermal rounding exponent, ψ = 0. 15, is robust and accounts for the different scaling properties of several observables both in the steady-state and in the transient relaxation to the steady-state. In particular, we show the compatibility of the thermal rounding exponent with the scaling properties of the steady-state structure factor, the universal short-time dynamics of the transient velocity at the sample critical force, and the velocity scaling function describing the joint dependence of the steady-state velocity on the external drive and temperature...|$|R
