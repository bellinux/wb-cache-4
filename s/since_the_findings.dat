5000|$|Justice Holmes {{delivered}} {{the majority opinion}} on May 8, 1905. The majority held that the petition for habeas corpus should have been denied because it alleged nothing except citizenship and since it “disclosed neither abuse of authority nor the existence of evidence not laid before the Secretary”. [...] The Supreme Court maintained that while the acts of Congress give no authority to exclude citizens, the acts grants administrative officials the power to determine finally {{whether or not a}} given person is a citizen. Holmes argued that even if Ju Toy was a native American, he could not get any relief from the Courts <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> of the immigration officials were conclusive and not subject to judicial review. The Supreme Court determined that refusing entry at a port does not deny due process since due process can be given without a judicial trial for citizens applying for admission. Therefore Ju Toy could not obtain reprieve from the judicial system and was subject to be deported to China.|$|E

30|$|Among {{patients}} with IRVAN syndrome, this inflammatory process may be activated by hypersensitivity reaction to tubercular antigens [9]. It {{has been speculated}} that the pathogenesis of IRVAN syndrome {{may be related to}} presumed tuberculous retinal vasculitis <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> in IRVAN syndrome resemble those of acquired allergic vascular diseases [9]. Peripheral retinal non-perfusion may occur in both the entities except for aneurysms at arteriolar bifurcations, which are a characteristic feature of IRVAN syndrome. A number of studies have demonstrated a strong association between retinal vasculitis and tuberculosis [13 – 16]. Thus, IRVAN syndrome can be considered to be a morphological diagnosis such as serpiginous choroidopathy, which may have various associations including ocular tuberculosis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for {{estimating}} the traffic demand {{risk associated with}} transportation. Using mathematical properties of wavelets, we develop a statistical measure of traffic demand sensitivity with respect to GDP.

We demonstrate the time-scale decomposition of risk with Swedish traffic demand data for 1950 - 2005. In general, rail transports show a stronger co-movement with GDP than road transports. Moreover, we examine the volatility exhibited by traffic demand. Our findings suggest that rail investments are more risky than road investments. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> {{can be used for}} optimal investment timing and for choice among public investment alternatives, they are deemed important for public policy in general...|$|E
