40|$|Previous studies {{conducted}} within IEA showed quite large differences in {{heating and cooling}} loads predicted by dynamic building energy simulation programs on hourly basis. The {{purpose of the study}} within <b>Annex</b> <b>XII</b> was to identify the problem areas responsible for those differences and to compare in more detail the calculation procedures connected to windows. The chosen strategy within <b>Annex</b> <b>XII</b> was to perform a detailed code to code comparison based on a given standard test room and Geneva climatological data. In {{order to be able to}} analyse and compare the calculation results of the different simulation codes, a uniform, standardized output structure had to be defined. One important subject was to give a most detailed building heat balance on monthly or seasonal basis. ...|$|R
