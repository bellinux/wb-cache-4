50|$|Like other siphonophores, Marrus orthocanna is {{a colony}} {{composed}} {{of a number of}} <b>specialised</b> zooids <b>linked</b> together by a long stem. At the front is the pneumatophore, an orange-coloured, gas-filled float. Behind this is the nectosome, a region where {{there are a number of}} translucent nectophores with red, unlooped radial canals. These are bell-shaped medusae specialised for locomotion. When they contract, water is expelled which causes the colony to move. Their contractions are coordinated which enables the animal to swim forwards, sidewards or backwards. The remaining region is the siphosome. Most of the zooids here are polyps, specialised for collecting food. They do this for the whole colony, spreading their single long tentacles in the water to snare prey. Other zooids in this region undertake digestion and assimilation of food items. Reproductive medusae are found among the polyps in the siphosome and also various other specialised zooids. The various forms are all arranged in a repeating pattern.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} my diploma thesis "CSR {{of the company}} PRVNÍ CHODSKÁ s. r. o. " is to analyse current CSR {{activities}} of this company {{and to find out}} how the public (employees and clients) are aware of these CSR activities. In the theoretical part, I characterised CSR, its basic fields and benefits, CSR assessment methods, CSR implementation and its communication by big companies or organizations such as European Union or IKEA by means of economic literature and <b>specialised</b> internet <b>links.</b> The practical part introduces the company PRVNÍ CHODSKÁ s. r. o. first of all briefly {{from the point of view}} of its business branch and then I analyse CSR activities and its communication organised by this company more in details. In this part, there is also a chapter about awards PRVNÍ CHODSKÁ won for its CSR activities and projects. In the end of the practical part, there is an analysis gained with a field research. Namely there are three questionnaires: questionnaire on CSR knowledge of PRVNÍ CHODSKÁ employees, questionnaire on CSR knowledge of PRVNÍ CHODSKÁ clients and last but not least questionnaire on satisfaction of PRVNÍ CHODSKÁ employees...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{collaboration}} and {{the exchange of}} information are increasing steadily and players need {{to agree on the}} meaning of words. The first task is therefore to define the domain’s terminology. However, terminology building remains a demanding and time-consuming task, even in specialised domains where standards already exist. While reaching a consensus on the definition of terms written in natural language remains difficult, we have observed that in specialised technical domains, experts agree on the domain conceptualisation when it is defined in a formal language. Based on this observation, we have introduced a new paradigm for terminology called ontoterminology. The main idea is to separate the linguistic dimension from the conceptual dimension of terminology and establish relationships between them. The linguistic component consists of terms (both normalised and non-normalised <b>specialised</b> words) <b>linked</b> by linguistic relationships such as hyponymy and synonymy. The term definition, written in natural-language, is considered a linguistic explanation. The conceptual component is a formal ontology whose concepts are linked by conceptual relationships like the is-a (kind of) and part-of relations. The concept definition, written in a formal language, is viewed as logical specification. An ontoterminology enables us to link these two non-isomorphic networks in a global and coherent system. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in neuroscience have emphasised {{the importance of}} integrated distributed networks of brain areas for successful cognitive functioning. Our current understanding is that the brain has a modular organisation in which segregated networks supporting <b>specialised</b> processing are <b>linked</b> through a few long-range connections, ensuring processing integration. Although such architecture is structurally stable, {{it appears to be}} flexible in its functioning, enabling long-range connections to regulate the information flow and facilitate communication among the relevant modules, depending on the contingent cognitive demands. Here we show how insights brought by the coregistration of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) integrate and support recent models of functional brain architecture. Moreover, we will highlight the types of data that can be obtained through TMS-EEG, such as the timing of signal propagation, the excitatory/inhibitory nature of connections and causality. Last, we will discuss recent emerging applications of TMS-EEG in the study of brain disorder...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the commercial}} activity {{generated by the}} port of Santander between 1766 and 1785, using hitherto unstudied documentation relating to the linking of the port with to the Consulado de Burgos at that time. During that period the port was only qualified for trading Windward and {{did not yet have}} its own Consulate; it constitutes a stage previous to its commercial apogee. The documentation analysed shows the nature of the commercial flows, the participants in this trade, and the guidelines used in this initial period. An image of Santander emerges as port <b>specialising</b> in imports, <b>linking</b> Western Europe, Northern Spain and the Americas, configuring an economic space in which commercial networks with dominant urban vectors are starting to be established. This process occurs {{at a time when the}} relative positions of the Cantabrian ports change, to the benefit of Santander, as is reflected in the growth favoured by its trade with the Americas...|$|R
40|$|This mini-dissertation {{emerged as}} a result of my {{enrolment}} as a Master of Education student in the Educator Professional Development course at the University of Pretoria. The pedagogy of the programme enlightened me on the innovative and the most influential learning style theories internationally, consequently justifying the criteria for my professional development as a high school English educator. Developing effective strategies of facilitating learning and creating powerful learning environments are a continual challenge on the part of all education practitioners. This challenge defined the aim of my research, which is to implement effectively an innovative idea that encompasses a holistic learning model that promotes learning style flexibility, as we all have our specific preference in terms of how we learn. The design of action research allowed for metalearning and it confirmed that my professional instruction and learning style complemented only a few learners in the class. I report empirically on the varied learning opportunities presented and the findings highlight that optimal learning can only be achieved if the diverse learning styles of the learners are accommodated and expanded. Moreover, learners have been armed with insight into their limitations and the way they learn best. As a result, they now have the foresight to maximise their learning by utilising varied learning styles in order to function as well-rounded learners, equipped with the skills for lifelong learning. This innovative model of holistic learning is corroborated by the metaphoric theory of Ned Herrmann who advocates that the brain comprises four quadrants, each with <b>specialised</b> functions <b>linked</b> to learning styles (Herrmann, 1996). My goal as an education practitioner was aimed at finding ways to improve the learning strategies of my learners. I deemed it necessary to challenge myself as well as other facilitators of learning to review systematically methods of facilitating and assessing instruction and learning outcomes to enhance the performance of learners. These key learning strategies can be achieved by adapting this transferable and generic holistic learning model to learning environments.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi a análise do movimento do fluido dentro de um segmento de vórtice em anel gerado através da ação magnetohidrodinâmica e o monitoramento do seu movimento resultante, de modo a oferecer condições de visualização usando velocimetria a {{laser com}} técnica de processamento de imagens de partículas envolvidas na circulação. O objetivo final desta linha de pesquisa é que através de análises de dados como as velocidades envolvidas na circulação obtida, possa modelar corpos em movimento em fluidos, de forma que o arrasto devido ao seu deslocamento possa ser reduzido. O movimento circulatório a que foi submetido o fluido sem meios mecânicos, ou seja, por meio de uma força resultante da ação de campos conjugados, teve a função de criar campos de baixa pressão tendo, para isso, acelerado o fluido em um circuito fechado restrito pela atuação da força e das paredes da célula de ensaio. O movimento do fluido, com a leitura da variação de velocidades em pontos diferentes do circuito teve o auxílio de um equipamento ótico que forneceu todas as variações, mesmo as mínimas, mostrando que tal aparato pode ser desenvolvido para a obtenção de melhores resultados. The {{aim of this}} work {{involves}} the analysis of fluid flow, using sea water stimulated by localised magnetohydrodynamic induction within an experimental glass sided receptacle. The above mentioned apparatus simulated one segment of a three dimensional apparatus capable of creating a flow pattern {{very similar to that}} of a vortex ring. Particle Image Velocimetry techniques using a copper vapour laser with computerised image and data acquisition system were used to analyse the flow in the experimental segment. The final aim of this line of research {{is to be able to}} eventually model the shape of bodies in movement within a fluid when combined with the use of a magnetohydrodynamically induced flow field in such a way as to significantly reduce fluid drag forces on the body. Circulatory movement was induced in the fluid within the confines of the experimental tank using a locally applied Lorentz field force between electrodes to accelerate the fluid. Both the electrical and magnetic fields were controlled independently using separate external rectified a. c. circuits. The aim of the fluid movement described above was to induce low static pressure over a specific surface area. The analysis of the fluid movement, including the measurement of velocities in different points of the circuit was attained using <b>specialised</b> optical equipment <b>linked</b> to a computerised data acquisition and analysis system. The results, which included exceptionally low velocity readings, showed thatsuch equipment possesses the potential for developed for the attainment of better results in the future...|$|R
