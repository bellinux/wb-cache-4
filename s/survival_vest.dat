2500|$|Devices {{designed}} {{and approved by}} authorities for use by civilians (recreational boaters, sailors, canoeists, kayakers) differ from those designed for use by passengers and crew of aircraft (helicopters, airplanes) and of commercial vessels (tugboats, passenger ferries, cargo ships). [...] Devices used by government and military (e.g. water police, coast guard, navy, marines) generally have features not found on civilian or commercial models, for example compatibility with other items worn, like a <b>survival</b> <b>vest,</b> bulletproof vest/body armor, equipment harness, rappelling harness, or parachute harness, {{and the use of}} ballistic nylon cloth to protect pressurized [...] canisters used for inflating the vest from injuring the wearer if struck by a round from a firearm. [...] The ballistic cloth keeps the fragments from the canister from becoming shrapnel injurious to the user.|$|E
50|$|The PRU-70 replaces three {{different}} items of aircrew clothing; the standard AIRSAVE <b>Survival</b> <b>Vest,</b> the separate body armor {{system that is}} worn beneath the AIRSAVE <b>survival</b> <b>vest</b> and the current PRU-60B. According to the manufacturer, this results in reduced cost and configuration management for both forces in combat and in logistic terms, due to the PRU-70â€™s ability to be worn as a stand-alone <b>survival</b> <b>vest</b> by simply being configured with or without life preservers (as authorized) and by adding or deleting body armor as needed.|$|E
500|$|In March 2003, JPAC {{investigators}} threw dummies {{over the}} edge at those points indicated by the VPA soldiers while a photographer in a helicopter videotaped their fall. That pointed the investigators to a ledge, [...] below. Several mountaineer-qualified JPAC specialists scaled down the cliffs to the ledge where they recovered leather boots in four different sizes, five <b>survival</b> <b>vests,</b> and other fragments of material that indicated the presence of at least four Americans.|$|R
5000|$|Pilots {{were issued}} Khaki and Olive Green (OG) flight suits, with both French and US {{patterns}} being worn. Privately purchased Thai camouflaged flight suits in [...] "Highland" [...] pattern were worn by Khmer Air Force Douglas AC-47D Spooky gunship aircrews on occasion, {{such as the}} members of the first contingent sent in May-June 1971 to Udorn Airbase in Thailand for gunship training. A US Air Force <b>survival</b> mesh <b>vest</b> was usually worn with the flight suits after 1970.|$|R
50|$|The Gyrojet {{principle}} {{was also}} examined {{for use in}} survival flare guns, and a similar idea was explored for a grenade launcher. The emergency-survival flare version (A/P25S-5A) was used for many years as a standard USAF issue item in <b>survival</b> kits, <b>vests,</b> and for forward operations signaling, with flares available in white, green, blue, and red. Known as the gyrojet flare, the A/P25S-5A came with a bandolier of seven flares and had an effective altitude of over 1500 ft. Its rounded-nose projectile was designed to ricochet through trees and clear an over canopy of branches.|$|R
50|$|The US Army uses several basic {{survival}} kits, {{mainly for}} aviators, {{some of which}} are stored in carrying bags. Aviators in planes with ejection seats have survival kits in a vest and the seat pan, the <b>survival</b> <b>vest</b> worn by US helicopter crews also contains some basic survival items.|$|E
5000|$|The PRU-70/P22P-18 (V) is an Armored <b>Survival</b> <b>Vest</b> (ASV) that is {{intended}} for aircrews. It will be fielded in 3 sizes (small, medium, and large) and was designed in house by Navair's Human Systems Division. The vests will be manufactured by Peckham Vocational Industries in Michigan and will be fielded to Navy and Marine aircrew in Iraq and Afghanistan.|$|E
5000|$|The PRU-70 merges {{both the}} aircrew <b>survival</b> <b>vest</b> {{and the latest}} in body armor. The new system was {{developed}} to fit {{the entire range of}} body types represented by {{the men and women in}} current U.S. aircrew population. The PRU-70 is also designed to reduce the bulk, weight and heat stressors commonly encountered by helicopter aircrews flying six or more hours on combat missions.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{occasional}} {{attempts at}} standardization, {{a great deal}} of latitude was noted in flight clothing; on combat missions RLAF aircrews relied on an inconsistent American-run supply system supplemented by items purchased during training in Thailand. Although US Olive Green (OG) flight suits were provided, Laotian pilots often wore commercial black and camouflage flight suits or standard issue Royal Lao Army (RLA) OG and camouflage combat jungle fatigues in lieu, usually with a US Air Force <b>survival</b> mesh <b>vest.</b> RLAF ground personnel adopted in the 1960s US Army OG-107 utilities, followed in 1971 by the M1967 Jungle Utility Uniform. Olive green US M-1951 field jackets were also issued to all-ranks.|$|R
5000|$|Along the way, {{the player}} {{can find a}} wide variety of items. These include a gas mask which can protect the eyes from {{decontamination}} gas, batteries which can be used to power specific electronics found throughout the facility, key cards ranging from access levels 1 to 5 that can open higher security doors, first aid kits which can heal wounds, an S-Navigator which can be used to navigate the rooms in the facility, a radio that can pick up transmissions on different channels, eye-drops which can slow down the player's blink timer, and SCP-294 which is located in the cafeteria. After using this machine, MTF (Mobile Task Force) Units or NTF (Nine Tailed Fox) units may be inserted into the facility while Subject D-9341 is roaming in the 'Entrance Zone'. The units will immediately open fire on D-9341 if they come into contact with him. If SCP-173 is close by, they will ignore D-9341 and go after and capture SCP-173 instead as their main objective. This gives the player the opportunity to escape (in normal circumstances the player would have to hide or be instantly killed by the gunfire unless they have a bullet-proof <b>vest.</b> <b>Survival</b> chances are still low when going {{face to face with the}} MTF) ...|$|R
50|$|Locher {{was afraid}} to use his URC-64 rescue radio as he parachuted because it was {{difficult}} to remove from the zippered pocket of his <b>survival</b> <b>vest</b> and he was not sure he could get it back in. He figured out his rough location and managed to steer his chute about 2000 yd away from the plane burning below him and towards a nearby mountain side. After he landed, he couldn't hide his parachute because it was stuck in the trees overhead.|$|E
50|$|He {{removed a}} couple of {{essential}} items from his survival pack and left the remainder behind. His <b>survival</b> <b>vest</b> contained a pistol, two pints of water, a first aid kit, insect repellent, mosquito netting, and a knife. He knew from prior briefings {{that he could not}} expect SAR this deep in North Vietnam, north of the Red River. Once on the ground and under the trees, he could not hear any jets overhead. He also knew his radio could not penetrate the dense jungle canopy overhead.|$|E

50|$|The Helicopter Emergency Egress Device (HEED) was {{introduced}} to the USAF by MSgt Andre' K. Leamons after losing a helicopter and crew off Kadena Japan in the late 1980s. Sergeant Leamons was the Life Support Superintendent for Air Rescue Service and introduced the HEED bottle to be included on crewmember <b>survival</b> <b>vest</b> for all Air Rescue Service members who flew over water. In the event of ditching, the HEED would provide additional time to escape from a submerged helicopter. MSgt Leamons found that the helicopter would turn over because the weight of the motor and rotor blades and sink upside down until it reached neutral buoyancy, which would leave the aircraft just below the surface. The HEED bottle would supply about 2-3 minutes of air, just enough to allow the crew to escape the aircraft and swim to the surface.|$|E
5000|$|In 1956, the U.S. Air Force {{adopted the}} Cartridge, Caliber [...]38, Ball M41, a {{military}} {{variant of the}} [...]38 Special cartridge designed {{to conform to the}} rules of land warfare. The original [...]38 M41 ball cartridge used a 130-grain full-metal-jacketed bullet, and was loaded to an average pressure of only , giving a muzzle velocity of approximately 725 ft/s from a 4 in barrel. This ammunition was intended to prolong the life of S&W M12 and Colt Aircrewman revolvers equipped with aluminum cylinders and frames, which were prone to stress fractures when fired with standard [...]38 ammunition. By 1961, a slightly revised M41 [...]38 cartridge specification known as the Cartridge, Caliber [...]38 Ball, Special, M41 had been adopted for U.S. armed forces using [...]38 Special caliber handguns. [...] The new M41 Special cartridge used a 130-grain FMJ bullet loaded to a maximum allowable pressure of [...] for a velocity of approximately 950 ft/s in a solid 6 in test barrel, and about 750 ft/s from a 4 in revolver barrel. [...] The M41 ball cartridge was first used in [...]38 revolvers carried by USAF aircrew and Strategic Air Command security police, and by 1961 was in use by the U.S. Army for security police, dog handlers, and other personnel equipped with [...]38 Special caliber revolvers. [...] A variant of the standard M41 cartridge with a semi-pointed, unjacketed lead bullet was later adopted for CONUS (Continental United States) police and security personnel.At the same time, [...]38 tracer cartridges were reintroduced by the US Navy, Marines, and Air Force to provide a means of emergency signaling by downed aircrew.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 101) New {{or modified}} Navy aircrew equipment is evaluated for safety, compatibility, comfort and utility prior to production and Fleet use. To provide insight {{as to the}} effect of sample size and sample selection on the results of an evaluation, data from the evaluation of the HGU- 27 /P Sonarman's Helmet was analyzed. Also, two new items of aircrew equipment were evaluated, for possible Fleet use, for the Crew System Branch of the Pacific Missile Test Center, Point Mugu, California. From the statistical analysis of the HGU- 27 /P data, it was concluded that: 1. The evaluation results and the squadron selected to perform the evaluation are not independent. 2. Randomly chosen samples with as few as five subjects will provide a reasonably correct evaluation of the equipment. 3. The evaluation results and the average experience level of the subjects are independent. Two versions of the Integrated Body Armor/Flotation/Survival System designed and manufactured by the Naval Air Development Center (NAVAIRDEVCEN) were provided to Pacific Missile Test Center for developmental test and evaluation. The integrated survival system is designed for helicopter aircrewmen and consists of the basic helicopter <b>survival</b> <b>vest,</b> a heat sealed LPA- 2 life preserver, a mini-raft, and front and/or rear armor plates. The integrated assemblies were evaluated by experienced aircrewmen in the swimming pool, in the open sea, during normal f 1 ight operations, and during combat Search and Rescue exercises. It was generally concluded that the integrated vest assembly offered improved configuration concepts over present survival equipment, but will require numerous modifications to be suitable for Fleet use.
