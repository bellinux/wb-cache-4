As a result, the rigging on Jupiter was rapidly shot away and the British ship fell back for urgent repairs and Preneuse was able to take the opportunity to escape. Granger returned to Table Bay on 16 October.|$|E

Second, Na Kika isolates individual scripts from each other and, instead of enforcing inflexible a-priori quotas, limits resource consumption based on overall system congestion. Third, Na Kika expresses security policies through the same predicates as regular application functionality, with the result that policies are as easily extensible as hosted code and that enforcement is an integral aspect of content processing. Additionally, Na Kika leverages a structured overlay network to support cooperative caching and incremental deployment with low administrative overhead. ...|$|R

40|$|The blood–brain barrier (BBB) {{constitutes}} a significant obstacle for {{the delivery of}} drugs into {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Nanoparticles have been able to partly overcome this obstacle and can thus improve drug delivery across the BBB. Furthermore, focused ultrasound in combination with gas filled microbubbles has opened the BBB in a temporospatial manner in animal models, thus facilitating drug delivery across the BBB. In the current study we combine these two approaches in our quest to develop a novel, generic method for drug delivery across the BBB and into the CNS. Nanoparticles were synthesized using the polymer poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) (PBCA), and such nanoparticles have been reported to cross the BBB to some extent. Together with proteins, these nanoparticles self-assemble into microbubbles. Using these novel microbubbles in combination with focused ultrasound, we successfully and <b>safely</b> <b>opened</b> the BBB transiently in healthy rats.

50|$|Unlike {{coiled tubing}} or wireline, where the wire or tubing {{is always the}} same {{diameter}} allowing for a single unmoving primary barrier (stuffing box or stripper), snubbing uses a pipe, which will have an enlarged collar at the connection between the joints. Therefore, the pressure control system must be able to accommodate this variable diameter. The stripping rams accomplish this. The first stage of lowering a collar through the stripping system is to close the lower rams so as to seal off the mechanism above from wellbore pressure. The space between the rams can then be bled off allowing the upper rams to be opened. The collar can then pass through the opened upper rams. Once the collar is in between the rams, the upper rams are closed and pressure is equalised either side of the lower rams. The lower rams are then <b>safely</b> <b>opened</b> and the collar is lowered through the rams.|$|R

In order to unroll brittle maps, some of which haven't been opened in over 100 years, the conservator and student assistants use a process of humidification, flattening, and drying to <b>safely</b> <b>open</b> the maps without causing additional damage. First, the maps are placed in a large humidity dome. After 5 or 6 hours of absorbing humidity the maps can be safely unrolled. The maps dry flat between polyester webbing and wool felts overnight. The majority of student assistants performing the preservation work are enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences. Next, the maps are transferred to the Office of Surface Mining National Mine Map Repository in Green Tree, Pennsylvania, where they are catalogued and scanned into a digital format. The scanning process uses an overhead Cruse scanner that has a suction table for maps that do not lay flat. The scanned image files are recorded in [...]tiff file format.

50|$|When a round is fired, {{residual}} {{energy from}} the propellant charge in the cartridge acts upon the safely locked breech and bolt carrier. Simultaneously, a quantity of powder gases driving the bullet through the barrel is tapped and acts upon the piston in the gas tube located below and parallel to the barrel. The movement of the piston and its connecting rod acts upon the locking bolt, causing it to rotate and allow the breech to <b>safely</b> <b>open.</b> This initiates the extraction and ejection cycle for the first spent cartridge. After the first round has been fired, the bolt and carrier group move toward the rear, ejecting the first casing towards {{the front of the}} ejection window. The movement of the Carrier is directly connected to a pulley system which is connected to a small metal rod on the rear side of the magazine well. The rod pushes a second round into the firing position. Once this action has completed the bolt and carrier group will stop and move back towards the front of the gun before it has hit the rear of the receiver. When the bolt has fully locked it will fire the second round. This whole process happens very quickly and it is how the 2 round burst works. For any follow up rounds, the pulley is disengaged to prevent the gun from firing at the extremely high rate continuously. This means that after every bullet the bolt and carrier group will travel the whole distance of possible travel, resulting in a more manageable rate of 600 RPM.|$|E

After a year political unrest forced the Wittmanns to return to Germany but by then he had seen many diseases in their advanced stages including abdominal infections. The culmination of experiences led Dr. Wittmann to begin to develop a means to keep the abdominal wall <b>safely</b> <b>open</b> for serial intra-operative treatment and control of healing processes. Early attempts used a variety of temporary closure devices such des retention sutures, zippers and slide fasteners. Ultimately he discovered the method of hook and loop fasteners to be optimal for closing the abdomen temporarily. In 1988 he joined the faculty Robert E. Condon and Dr. Charles Aprahamian at the Medical College of Wisconsin and became a full Professor of Surgery. He developed one of the first US surgical critical care fellowship programs at the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1990 and became its first director. In 2000 Dr. Wittmann retired from the medical college but continued his work on staged abdominal repair and the hook and loop fastener temporary fascia prosthesis. He remained active providing advice to surgeons worldwide using his website www.openabdomen.org and continued to lecture about the fundamental benefits of planned open abdomen.|$|E

50|$|The {{state of}} zombification seen in O'Bannon's Return of the Living Dead series is {{induced by the}} {{chemical}} compound Trioxin, an extremely toxic substance found in a gaseous state at standard temperature and pressure. Depending on the film in the series, Trioxin zombies {{may or may not}} be able to contaminate living humans with Trioxin via bite. Very small amounts of Trioxin are sufficient to have full effect, and bodies need not be fresh to be re-animated. Both factors were illustrated in the first two films, wherein Trioxin seeped through several feet of earth to reach graves several decades old and animate the occupants (Return of the Living Dead even depicted a near-skeleton coming out of its grave). If a zombie corpse is stored for too long in a sealed container, the decomposition process will generate noxious gases containing trace amounts of Trioxin, so the drum can only be <b>safely</b> <b>opened</b> in a sealed lab environment. The requirement of Trioxin exposure makes containment to a specific area or group of people somewhat easier than Romero's plague (though the extreme tenacity of the zombies may mitigate this advantage).|$|R
5000|$|Magnus (real name Cuthbert Sinclair), {{portrayed by}} Kavan Smith, {{is a former}} Man of Letters who has caused Sam and Dean trouble {{directly}} and indirectly on two occasions. Magnus was a powerful magician who was so good at spells, he was made the Men of Letters Master of Spells right after he was initiated into the order. He acted as Henry Winchester, Sam and Dean's grandfather's mentor and designed most of the warding for the Men of Letters bunker. However, {{he felt that the}} Men of Letters should be more proactive, using their knowledge to fight evil instead of hiding it away and protecting it. Magnus' ideas got so radical that after he created the Werther Box, a vault designed to protect an important decryption codex but with a deadly alarm system, he was kicked out of the Men of Letters on May 16, 1956. As a result, he survived the massacre of the order by Abaddon in 1958. Crowley became aware of his separation from the Men of Letters and attempted to locate him to get into the Men of Letters bunker, but failed to find him. At some point Magnus changed his name from Cuthbert Sinclair to Magnus, the name the Men of Letters use while going incognito, long enough that he hadn't gone by it in a long time by 2014 and built himself a warded impenetrable hideout where he collected important supernatural artifacts and a zoo of various creatures including vampires and shapeshifters. Due to his proficiency with spells, Magnus was able to make himself immortal, looking forever to be in his 30s despite being much older. Several weeks before the events of [...] "Blade Runners", Magnus tracked down the mythical First Blade and acquired it for his collection. Searching for the First Blade to kill Abaddon, Sam and Dean tracked down Magnus {{with the help of the}} Men of Letters files and Crowley and were able to get him to talk to them by mentioning their grandfather and the Men of Letters. However, upon learning that Dean had the Mark of Cain, Magnus decided to add him to his collection rather than help them and teleported Sam outside. Magnus worked to convince Dean to work with him and then attempted to brainwash him when that failed. Eventually Sam and Crowley managed to break in and while Magnus was distracted with Sam, Crowley freed Dean who decapitated Magnus with the First Blade to save his brother. A year later during [...] "The Werther Project", Sam learned of Magnus' connection to the Werther Box while searching for the codex inside. Following the destruction of the Men of Letters, Magnus' creation had caused at least four deaths and Sam and Dean set out to disarm it and get the codex. They eventually discovered that Magnus had designed the box so that only all of the blood of a Man of Letters could disarm the spell and open it, but by combining their blood, the Winchesters were able to <b>safely</b> <b>open</b> it. After getting the codex, Dean destroyed the Werther Box just to be safe.|$|E

In {{the case of a}} recent DOE report [1], materials needed for the production of green energy technologies were deemed as those needing study. A major conclusion of these papers {{is that there is a}} need for recycling of materials that are designated as strategic or have a potential of becoming scarce. Lithium is one such material. It is critical to the battery industry, especially in compact consumer electronics (e. g. mobile phones and tablets) and in hybrid electrical and fully electrical vehicles. In this paper the role of lithium in electronics and vehicles is reviewed. Also reviewed are the reserves, projected mining capacity, and forecasted demand for lithium. Based on these three, it is predicted that there will be a shortage of lithium between 2021 and 2023 if lithium is not recycled [4]. Current lithium ion battery technologies recover little if any lithium and are energy intensive since they incinerate or shred batteries after they have been cooled in liquid nitrogen.
