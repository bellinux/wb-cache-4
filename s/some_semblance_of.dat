5|$|Heinrich von Treitschke's History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century, {{published}} in 1879, has perhaps a misleading title: it privileges {{the history of}} Prussia over the history of other German states, and it {{tells the story of}} the German-speaking peoples through the guise of Prussia's destiny to unite all German states under its leadership. The creation of this Borussian myth (Borussia is the Latin name for Prussia) established Prussia as Germany's savior; it was the destiny of all Germans to be united, this myth maintains, and it was Prussia's destiny to accomplish this. According to this story, Prussia played the dominant role in bringing the German states together as a nation-state; only Prussia could protect German liberties from being crushed by French or Russian influence. The story continues by drawing on Prussia's role in saving Germans from the resurgence of Napoleon's power in 1815, at Waterloo, creating <b>some</b> <b>semblance</b> <b>of</b> economic unity, and uniting Germans under one proud flag after 1871.|$|E

The sound was similarly lambasted for being cheap and lackluster. Gaming Age found that though the added complexity and puzzle-solving to find the generators was enjoyable at first, it grew boring after all enemies on the match were dispatched, and the player was left running in circles to find the last generator.

Blue Star didn't win another game until July, and during their mid-season drought suffered seven defeats in nine games, including a 6-1 hammering by Los Angeles Legends, a 3-0 home defeat by Fresno Fuego, and a humiliating 4-2 loss away to Lancaster Rattlers in what was that franchise's second ever victory. As July came round, Blue Star were rooted {{at the foot of}} the Southwest standings, but three victories in their last three games, including an impressive 3-1 win over Bakersfield Brigade, gave their year at least <b>some</b> small <b>semblance</b> <b>of</b> respectability.

Yet defeating the guerrilla resistance at the remote hill states—Mohnyin and Mogaung in the extreme north also revolted in 1571—proved far more difficult.

His body {{was found on the}} bare rock, quite near the refuge, on the following day. The poor fellow had probably perished in the dark, within a few yards of shelter, without knowing it.

60|$|Arriving in England {{at the end}} of July 1884, Stevenson took up his {{quarters}} first for a few weeks at Richmond. He was compelled to abandon the hope of making his permanent home at Hyères, partly by the renewed failure there of his own health, partly by a bad outbreak of cholera which occurred in the old Provençal town about the time he left it. After consultation with several doctors, all of whom held out hopes of ultimate recovery despite the gravity of his present symptoms, he moved to Bournemouth. Here he found in the heaths and pinewoods <b>some</b> distant <b>semblance</b> <b>of</b> the landscape of his native Scotland, and in the sandy curves of the Channel coast a passable substitute for the bays and promontories of his beloved Mediterranean. At all events, he liked the place well enough to be willing to try it for a home; and such it became for all but three years, from September 1884 to August 1887. These, although in the matter of health the worst and most trying years of his life, were in the matter of work some of the most active and successful. For the first two or three months the Stevensons occupied a lodging on the West Cliff called Wensleydale; for the next five, from mid-November 1884 to mid-April 1885, they were tenants of a house named Bonallie Towers, pleasantly situated amid the pinewoods of Branksome Park, and by its name recalling familiar Midlothian associations. Lastly, about Easter 1885, they entered into occupation of a house of their own, given by the elder Mr. Stevenson as a special gift to his daughter-in-law, and renamed by its new occupants Skerryvore, in reminiscence of one of the great lighthouse works carried out by the family firm off the Scottish coast.|$|R

Unable {{to deal with the}} crisis, Alba was replaced by the more moderate Luis de Zúñiga y Requesens in 1573. Requesens was hampered by the bankruptcy of the Spanish crown in 1575, which left him without funds to maintain his army. The Army of Flanders mutinied, and shortly after Requesens' death in 1576 almost effectively ceased to exist, disintegrating in various mutinous factions.

25|$|After a brief stay at Asti where Henry {{intervened in}} the {{political}} affairs in the town, much {{to the consternation of}} the Italian Guelphs, Henry proceeded to Milan, where he was crowned King of Italy with the Iron Crown of Lombardy on January 6, 1311. The Tuscan Guelphs refused to attend the ceremony, and began preparing for resistance to Henry’s imperial dreams. As part of his program of political rehabilitation, he recalled the Visconti, the ousted former rulers of Milan from exile. Guido della Torre, who had thrown the Visconti out of Milan, objected and organised a revolt against Henry that was ruthlessly put down, and the Visconti were returned to power, with Henry appointing Matteo I Visconti as the Imperial vicar of Milan. He also imposed his brother-in-law, Amadeus of Savoy, as the vicar-general in Lombardy. These measures, plus a massive levy imposed on the Italian towns, caused the Guelph cities to turn against Henry, and he encountered further resistance when he sought to enforce imperial claims on what had become communal lands and rights, and attempted to replace communal regulations with imperial laws. Nevertheless, Henry managed to restore <b>some</b> <b>semblance</b> <b>of</b> imperial power in parts of northern Italy. Cities such as Parma, Lodi, Verona and Padua all accepted his rule.|$|E
5000|$|Hauptamt II {{officials}} under Viktor Brack {{played a}} vital role in organizing the killing of mentally ill and physically handicapped people in the Action T4 [...] "euthanasia" [...] programme, especially the child [...] "euthanasia" [...] from 1939. By a (backdated) decree of 1 September, Hitler appointed Bouhler and his personal physician Karl Brandt to manage the euthanasia program, where they would oversee the murder of physically and/or mentally disabled persons. The implementation of the killing operations were left to subordinates such as Brack and SA-Oberführer Werner Blankenburg. Besides Hitler's Chancellery, only a handful of personnel were privy to {{the inner workings of the}} euthanasia program so as to maintain secrecy, which is part of the reason Hitler chose Bouhler, as he knew the KdF [...] "could direct the killings without involving too many people and without becoming too visible." [...] During the killing phase related to euthanizing children, the KdF chose the cover title, Reich Committee for the Scientific Registration of Severe Hereditary Ailments, which only actually existed on paper; code names were also employed by members of the KdF for matters dealing with euthanasia. In order to provide <b>some</b> additional <b>semblance</b> <b>of</b> legitimacy to the operation, three doctors or [...] "certifiers" [...] also had to concur over any diagnosis before a [...] "merciful death" [...] could be administered, which included the final signature of a psychiatrist—all of which really boiled down to the economic considerations regarding the person's ability to work. To execute the deportations, the Gemeinnützige Krankentransport GmbH camouflage organization was established, residing on Tiergartenstraße No. 4. Just like earlier euthanasia operations, secrecy was again paramount, as Hitler explicitly told Bouhler concerning Aktion T4, [...] "the Führer's Chancellery must under no circumstances be seen to be active in this matter." [...] Many KdF employees who participated in T4 later joined the Operation Reinhard killings executed under Odilo Globocnik in the Polish General Gouvernement.|$|R
