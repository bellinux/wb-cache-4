40|$|The policy [...] service {{based on}} the traffic {{characteristics}} is becoming important for the Internet shared by various applications. For this purpose, the router is required to forward packets {{according to the requirements}} of the traffic flow that the packet belongs to. However, the packet (and flow) classification easily becomes a bottleneck in the high [...] speed router because the router is necessary to <b>search</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>fields</b> within the packet. In this paper, we propose a new packet classification algorithm capable of following the packet forwarding rate of the high [...] speed routers with the commercially available CPU, RAM, and cache memories. Through our experiments, we show the effects of parameters of the cache memory on the processing rate of packet classification...|$|R

It stores only the associations between items from <b>multiple</b> <b>search</b> <b>fields</b> {{in the form of}} binary links, and merges repeated field items to reduce the memory requirements. It achieves 13. 6 × reduction in memory bits and accesses, and 8. 6 × reduced number of clock cycles in search operation compared to a classical field-based search structure using content-addressable memory. Furthermore, using parallel computational nodes in the proposed search engine, it achieves five orders of magnitude reduced number of clock cycles compared to a CPU-based counterpart running a classical search algorithm in software...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} algorithm, architecture, and fabrication {{results of}} a non-volatile context-driven search engine that reduces energy consumption as well as computational delay compared to classical hardware and software-based approaches. The proposed architecture stores only associations between items from <b>multiple</b> <b>search</b> <b>fields</b> {{in the form of}} binary links, and merges repeated field items to reduce the memory requirements and accesses. The fabricated chip achieves 13. 6 × memory re- duction and 89 % energy saving compared to a classical field- based approach in hardware, based on content-addressable memory (CAM). Furthermore, it achieves 8. 6 × reduced number of clock cycles in performing search operations compared to the CAM, and five orders of magnitude reduced number of clock cycles compared to a fabricated and measured ultra low-power CPU-based counterpart running a classical search algorithm in software. The energy consumption of the proposed architecture is on average three orders of magnitude smaller than that of a software-based approach.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the scalar gravitational and matter perturbations {{in the context}} of slow-roll inflation with <b>multiple</b> scalar <b>fields,</b> that take values on a (curved) manifold, to first order in slow roll. For that purpose a basis for these perturbations determined by the background dynamics is introduced and <b>multiple</b> <b>field</b> slow-roll functions are defined. To obtain analytic solutions to first order, the scalar perturbation modes have to be treated in three different regimes. Consistency of the various approximations fixes their matching times. <b>Multiple</b> <b>field</b> effects in the gravitational potential are due to the rotation of the basis and to the particular solution caused by the coupling to the field perturbation perpendicular to the field velocity. They can contribute even to leading order if the corresponding <b>multiple</b> <b>field</b> slow-roll function is sizable during the last 60 e-folds.
