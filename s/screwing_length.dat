40|$|AbstractThe goods made of light-gage metal blocks {{providing}} for threaded attachment of different components have currently been {{widely used in}} mechanical engineering. The problem of ensuring strength of such connections consists in achieving a sufficient <b>screwing</b> <b>length</b> {{providing for}} three-five thread turns. Such methods as plate bending, welding of nuts, molding of plugs and deformation of metal blocks in closed press tools are applied to increase the <b>screwing</b> <b>length.</b> All these methods are insufficiently advanced and require application of additional equipment and consumables. This problem can be solved by forming tap holes by thermal drilling, when the material of the hole is not removed with chips but used for flanging, thus, ensuring sufficient <b>screwing</b> <b>length.</b> This article considers the mechanism of flanging formation by the rotating punch, interconnection between geometrical dimensions of flanging and process simulation by means of ANSYS software package...|$|E

Methods. 12 pairs of forearm specimens from 11 male and one female East Asian cadavers were scanned using computed tomography. On sagittal {{images of the}} distal radius, the mean cortex-to-cortex distance of 8 quadrants was measured as a reference for the distal <b>screw</b> <b>length.</b> In addition, intra-operative 3 -dimensional fluoroscopy of 10 male and 10 female patients who underwent volar locking plate fixation for distal radial fractures was used to validate the distal <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> in the cadaveric reference. 76 distal locking screws were applied in the 8 quadrants; their cortex-to-cortex distances were measured. Results. The mean cortex-to-cortex distances at quadrants A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H were 15. 4 mm, 19. 6 mm, 20. 8 mm, 20. 0 mm, 13. 3 mm, 18. 0 mm, 18. 8 mm, and 17. 4 mm, respectively. In 45 % of the specimens, the 2 screws inserted at quadrants C and D were longest. Distal screws (quadrants A to D) were significantly longer than proximal screws (quadrants E to H) [p= 0. 02]. In intra-operative 3 -dimensional fluoroscopic images, 2 of the 76 distal locking screws penetrated the dorsal cortex (one in quadrant A and one in quadrant F). The mean <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> was 88. 0 % of the cortex-to-cortex distance. When referenced to the cadaveric data, 88. 2 % of the screws could be safely inserted without penetrating the dorsal cortex, and the remaining 11. 8 % of screws (5 at quadrant D, one at quadrant B, and 3 at quadrant C; all in female patients) could potentially cause dorsal cortex penetration of 2 to 4 mm. In male patients, the mean <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> was 76. 1 % of the cortex-to-cortex distance based on the cadaveric reference. In female patients, when the <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> was 4 mm less than the cadaveric reference, the mean <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> would be 72. 0 % of the referenced cortex-to-cortex distance, with no dorsal cortex penetration. Conclusion. In female patients, the <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> should be 4 mm less than the cadaveric reference to avoid dorsal cortex penetration. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Objective: We {{describe}} a surgical tool {{that uses the}} distractor pin as a reference for determining proper <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> in ACDF. It is critical that screw purchase depth be as deep as possible without violating or penetrating the posterior cortical wall, which ensures strong pull out strength. Methods: We enrolled 81 adult patients who underwent ACDF using an anterior cervical plate from 2010 to 2012. Patients were categorized into Groups A (42 patients: retractor pin used as a reference for <b>screw</b> <b>length)</b> and B (39 patients: control group). Intraoperative lateral x-rays were taken after screwing the retractor pin to confirm the approaching vertebral level. The ratio of retractor pin length to body anteroposterior (A-P) diameter was measured as a reference. Proper <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> was determined by comparison to the reference. Results: The average distance from screw tip to posterior wall was 3. 0 ± 1. 4 mm in Group A and 4. 1 ± 2. 3 mm in Group B. The ratio of <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> to body sagittal diameter was 86. 2 ± 5. 7 % in Group A and 80. 8 ± 9. 0 % in Group B. <b>Screw</b> <b>length</b> to body sagittal diameter ratios higher than 4 / 5 occurred in 33 patients (90 %) in Group A and 23 patients (59 %) in Group B.

The screw treads should fit into the odontoid medulla, should pass the fracture line, and should pull fractured odontoid tip against body of axis {{in order to achieve}} optimum screw placement and treatment. This study has demonstrated optimal anterior odontoid <b>screw</b> thickness, <b>length,</b> and optimal angle for safe and strong anterior odontoid screw placement. Dry bone axis vertebrae were evaluated by direct measurements, X-ray measurements, and computerized tomography (CT) measurements. The screw thickness (inner diameter of the odontoid) was measured as well as <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> (distance between anterior-inferior point body of axis and tip of odontoid), and screw angle (the angle between basis of axis and tip of odontoid).

40|$|Postoperative tunnel {{enlargement}} {{has been}} frequently reported after {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) reconstruction. Interference screw, as a surgical implant in ACL reconstruction, may influence natural loading transmission and contribute to tunnel enlargement. The aims {{of this study are}} (1) to quantify the alteration of strain energy den-sity (SED) distribution after the anatomic single-bundleACL reconstruction; and (2) to characterize the influence of <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> and diameter on the degree of the SED alteration. A validated finite element model of human knee joint was used. The <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> ranging from 20 to 30 mm with screw diameter ranging from 7 to 9 mm were investigated. In the post-operative knee, the SED increased steeply at the extra-articular tunnel aperture under compressive and complex loadings, whereas the SED decreased beneath the screw shaft and nearby the intra-articular tunnel aperture. Increasing the <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> could lower the SED deprivation in the proximal part of the bone tunnel; whereas increasing either <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> or diameter could aggravate the SED deprivation in the distal part of the bone tunnel. Decreasing the elastic modulus of the screw could lower the bone SED deprivation around the screw. In consideration of both graft stability and SED alteration, a biodegradable interference screw with a long length is recommended, which could provide a beneficial mechanical environment at the distal part of the tunnel, and meanwhile decrease the bone-graft motion and synovial fluid propagation at the proximal part of the tunnel. These findings together with the clinical and histological factors could help to improve surgical outcome, and serve as a preliminary knowledge for the following study of biodegradable interference screw.

Moreover, X-ray CT (computed tomography) observations of anchor members from both tests revealed that failure behavior clearly differed between the tightening test and the pull-out test: tightening caused damage to the wooden, female thread in addition to major splitting damage in the wood {{perpendicular to the grain}} near the tip of the lag screw.|$|R

This article investigates the implications of such revisions on the endurance properties of an implant already on the market. Experimental fatigue tests demonstrate that the revision of F 1717 standard leads to a reduction of 3. 2 million cycles in the fatigue strength of the tested implant: this amount {{is comparable to the}} run-out number of cycles (5 million cycles) currently recommended. The numerical analysis, validated with static tests and strain gauges, supports the experimental findings and demonstrates that the stress on the implant may increase upon revision up to a 50 % on the screw (most recurrent failure mode), with the unsupported <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> contributing alone up to 40 %.

Two groups of bone-plate constructs were assembled: Group 1 &# 8211; three monocortical screws on each fracture side, Group 2 - three bicortical screws on each fracture side. In each group nine bone-plate constructs were tested until failure, three each in bending, compression and torsion. In each group, 21 bone-plate constructs were tested for failure in fatigue testing, seven each for bending, compression and torsion. In all static testing {{no significant differences were}} found between G 1 and G 2, except ultimate moment in torsion test (G 2 >G 1; P= 0. 008). Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between groups in axial compression fatigue testing (G 1 >G 2; P< 0. 05) and four-point bending fatigue testing (G 1 <G 2; P< 0. 05) in maximum load, minimum load, maximum moment, and minimum moment. In conclusion, <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> can affect the mechanical properties of locking reconstruction plate.

However, the feasibility for the use of S 1, S 2 and S 2 -ilium screws has not been fully investigated in the Asian population. To assess feasibility, morphometric parameters and safety of S 1, S 2 and S 2 -ilium screw insertion in the Asian population. 180 three dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans of pelvis (90 males and 90 females) with contrast were analysed using Mimics(A (R)) version 13. 1 (Materialise, Belgium) software. All parameters were measured using this programme. The safety medial trajectory of S 1 pedicle screw was 11. 8 +/- A 3. 9 to 37. 1 +/- A 4. 5 A degrees in males and 11. 7 +/- A 3. 1 to 35. 9 +/- A 4. 4 A degrees in females. The <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> was from 35. 0 +/- A 3. 0 to 58. 3 +/- A 3. 1 mm in males and from 31. 9 +/- A 2. 6 to 53. 1 +/- A 3. 5 mm in females. Right S 1 pedicle screws were safe as long as the anterior cortical penetration of quadrant 2, 3 and 4 were avoided. On the left, it was safe for the screws to exit at quadrant 1, 2 and 3. The lateral trajectory of S 2 sacral alar screw was from 0 to 32. 6 +/- A 3. 3 A degrees in males and from 0 to 33. 6 +/- A 3. 5 A degrees in females. The <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> was from 23. 9 +/- A 3. 2 to 53. 1 +/- A 4. 1 mm in males and from 23. 0 +/- A 2. 5 to 53. 2 +/- A 4. 5 mm in females. For S 2 screws, on the right side, the frequency of the internal iliac artery location was 7. 2, 38. 3, 47. 2 and 1. 7 for quadrants 1, 2, 3 and 4, whereas on the left side, the frequency was 7. 8, 50. 6, 33. 9 and 2. 2 for quadrants 1, 2, 3 and 4. For S 2 -ilium screws, the lateral trajectory was from 39. 3 +/- A 3. 1 to 50. 4 +/- A 6. 1 A degrees in males and from 39. 5 +/- A 3. 1 to 50. 2 +/- A 5. 9 A degrees in females.

A biomechanical in vitro {{study was designed to}} assess the bone–screw interface fixation strength of seven different screws used for correction of scoliosis in spine surgery. The objectives of the current study were twofold: (1) to evaluate the initial strength at the bone–screw interface of newly developed vertebral screws (Universal Spine System II) compared to established systems (product comparison) and (2) to evaluate the influence of screw design, <b>screw</b> diameter, <b>screw</b> <b>length</b> and bone mineral density on pullout strength. Fifty-six calf vertebral bodies were instrumented with seven different screws (USS II anterior 8. 0  mm, USS II posterior 6. 2  mm, KASS 6. 25  mm, USS II anterior 6. 2  mm, USS II posterior 5. 2  mm, USS 6. 0  mm, USS 5. 0  mm). Bone mineral density (BMD) was determined by quantitative computed tomography (QCT). Failure in axial pullout was tested using a displacement-controlled universal test machine. USS II anterior 8. 0  mm showed higher pullout strength than all other screws. The difference constituted a tendency (P =  0. 108) when compared to USS II posterior 6. 2  mm (+ 19 %) and was significant in comparison to the other screws (+ 30 to + 55 %, P <  0. 002).

A permanent magnet motor, lead screw, ball nut and bearings are employed as the machine, traverse actuator mechanism. Hybrid, distributed¿lumped parameter methods are used to model the machine tool x-axis drive system. Inclusion of the spatial configuration of the drive generates the incident, travelling and reflected vibration signature of the system. Lead screw interactive torsion and tension loading, which is excited by cutting and input disturbance conditions, is incorporated in the modelling process. Measured and results from simulation exercises are presented in comparative studies enabling the dynamic characteristics of the machine to be identified under, no load and with the application of cyclic, cutting force disturbances. The effect of the lead <b>screw</b> <b>length,</b> cutting speed and hence the load disturbance frequency are examined and the resulting performance accuracy is commented upon...|$|R
40|$|Different {{navigation}} procedures (based on 2 D-, 3 D-fluoroscopy or CT modalities) with their respective limitations are established in orthopedic surgery. The {{hypothesis is that}} intraoperative matching of different modalities (fluoro and CT) increases the precision of navigated screw placement and reduces the fluoroscopy time. Vertical unstable pelvic ring fractures of 12 patients were treated with vertebro-pelvic fixations (6 in the standard technique and 6 using the fluoro-CT navigation). An optimal osseous corridor could {{be determined by the}} navigation procedure increasing the overall precision of screw placement (no misplacement in the second group as compared to one malplaced pedicle screw in the standard group). The achieved <b>screw</b> <b>lengths</b> were [(mean ± SE) 78  ±  5 vs. 53  ±  4  mm, p <  0. 001). Less invasive open approaches and a reduction of fluoroscopy time (time per screw in seconds: 121 vs. 62  s) were observed. CT-fluoro-matched navigation improves the intraoperative visualization of osseous structures and increases the precision of screw placement with less radiation exposure...|$|R

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldTo study potential risks for complications in posterior articular pillar plate fixation, screw-plate systems of Roy-Camille, Louis, and Magerl were implanted into the cervical spines of cadavers under authentic operation theater conditions and in vitro into isolated spine specimens according to the inaugurators' recommendations with regard to plate and screw positioning. We compared these systems with the method of our preference, using the small AO compression plate and monitoring each screw insertion fluoroscopically. The screws were directed toward the projection of the pedicles, and their length was measured individually. Radiographic analysis of the specimens and cryoplaning after implant removal and casting of the screw-plate cavities showed significant differences of the four systems with respect to effective <b>screw</b> <b>length,</b> possible and desirable screw trajectories, and risk for injuries of the facet joints, foraminal neurovascular elements, and vertebral artery, as well as mechanical conflict of the plate with adjacent facet joints...|$|R
