40|$|Materials can {{be divided}} into two basic categories: struc-tural or functional.

Another example is a remarkable class of materials known as auxetic materials. 1 When stretched lengthways, these materials get fatter rather than thinner (see Figure 1). As well as this unique characteristic, auxetic materials have enhanced mechani-cal and physical properties, which means that they can actually be classified as both structural and functional materials.

A genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimise the dimensions of the plates used for the columns, rafters and haunches. Discrete decision variables were adopted for the thickness of the steel plates and continuous variables for the breadth and depth of the plates. Strategies were developed to enhance the performance of the GA including solution space reduction and a hybrid initial population half of which is derived using Latin hypercube sampling. The results show that the proposed GA-based optimisation model generates optimal and near-optimal solutions consistently. A parametric study is then conducted on frames of different spans.
