2500|$|A {{commercial}} sporting {{version of}} the M1895 Lee <b>Straight</b> <b>Pull</b> was sold by Winchester. It did not sell well in U.S. markets due to a heavy preference by American consumers for lever-action rifle designs. [...] The cartridge was chambered {{for a time in}} the Remington-Lee and Blake magazine rifles. [...] With a reputation for penetration and explosive effect, the 6mm Lee was reportedly quite popular as a hunting cartridge in Alaska and Northwest Canada. [...] It was discontinued from commercial production in 1935. [...] The 6mm Lee cartridge case later served {{as the basis for the}} [...]220 Swift, which used a necked-down 6mm Lee case with a [...]22-caliber bullet.|$|E
2500|$|In road vehicles, {{the parking}} brake, also called hand brake, {{emergency}} brake, [...] or e-brake, {{is used to}} keep the vehicle stationary {{and in many cases}} also perform an emergency stop. Parking brakes on older vehicles often consist of a cable connected to two wheel brakes at one end and the other end to a pulling mechanism which is operated with the driver's hand or foot. The mechanism may be a hand-operated lever, at floor level beside the driver, or a <b>straight</b> <b>pull</b> handle located near the steering column, or a (foot-operated) pedal located beside the drivers leg. In most automobiles the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking. Some automobiles have the parking brake operate on the front wheels, for example most Citroens manufactured since the end of World War II.|$|E

50|$|Zhang also {{performs}} a hyper-extended Biellmann spin. She {{is one of}} several young skaters to perform this move. In this variation, the leg is <b>pulled</b> <b>straight</b> {{up in the air and}} the back bent as far into the spin as possible. Zhang is able to perform the spin with her free leg <b>pulled</b> <b>straight</b> up into the air, with very little knee bend, making the spin look closer to a capital-I position than the usual Biellmann teardrop shape. She has received a straight +3.00 grade of execution for her layback spin.|$|R

To avoid accidents with set triggers, Blaser offers the R8 {{only with a}} direct trigger. The compact detachable box magazine/trigger unit contributes to balancing the rifle, as the Blaser <b>straight</b> <b>pull</b> action is about 50 to 60 mm shorter than conventional bolt actions.|$|E

50|$|Generally bolt-action {{and break}} barrel hunting rifles in C.I.P. {{regulated}} countries are not {{cut to the}} minimum C.I.P. chamber dimensions so this problem is mostly theoretical. The arms manufacturer SIG Sauer brands Blaser and Mauser are however known for hammer forging tight (but still C.I.P. conform) chambers in their Blaser R93 <b>straight</b> <b>pull</b> bolt-action and Mauser M03 bolt-action switch barrel rifles and some rifle owners reported ΔL problems with those rifles. These problems can also occur with other European made rifle brands.|$|E

This appliance is specifically indicated for adolescents or pre-adolescents patients who are in mixed dentition and are very compliant.|$|E
50|$|BSA Guns Ltd, a {{licensee}} {{of protecting}} the patents of the Thompson Autorifle made {{a handful of the}} 1923 model Thompsons as 'heavy rifles' with folding bipods and finned barrels. Surviving examples suggest there were Rifle and Light Machine Gun variants and 6 of both types were manufactured. The first examples were made in 1924 and an 'improved' variant in 1926. The 'improved' BSA Thompson had a shorter operation with a <b>straight</b> <b>pull</b> cocking handle installed at the rear of a cocking sleeve. One example survives today.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the sport}} of biathlon, because semiautomatic guns are illegal for race use, straight-pull actions are quite common, and are used almost {{exclusively}} on the world cup along with the Lateral Toggle action. The first company to make the <b>straight</b> <b>pull</b> action for [...]22 caliber was J. G. Anschütz; the action is specifically the <b>straight</b> <b>pull</b> ball bearing lock action, which features spring-loaded ball bearings {{on the side of}} the bolt which lock into a groove inside the bolt's housing. With the new design came a new dry-fire method; instead of the bolt being turned up slightly, the action is locked back to catch the firing pin. The two companies who have made the lateral toggle are Finn biathlon, as well as Izhmash. Finn was the first to make this type of action, however, due to the large swing of the arm as well as the stiffness of the bolt, these rifles fell out of favour and have been discontinued. Izhmash improved on the lateral swing with their Biathlon 7-3 and 7-4 series rifles, which have some use on world cups, but are largely thought of as inaccurate as well as having the inconvenience of having to remove the shooter's hand from the grip.|$|E
