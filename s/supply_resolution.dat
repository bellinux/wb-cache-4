She had been very fond of her husband: she had buried him. She had been used to affluence: it was gone. She had no child to connect her with life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable. Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with no possibility of moving {{from one to the other}} without assistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford, and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath. Yet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment. How could it be? She watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only.

A three dimensional finite element model has been developed to simulate this process. Through an ALE framework, a level set approach is used to model the interface between the metal and the surrounding gas. Even though the physics of the plasma is not modelled, both thermal and material supply phenomena are taken into account: (i) The laser and GMAW heat sources are simulated and applied on the interface through the Continuum Surface Force method, (ii) An original method of volume element expansion has been chosen to simulate the material supply and the bead formation. A thermo mechanical problem resolution has been settled in this model. Depending on the thermal evolution of the mechanical parameters and on the velocity field, the material behaviour will be elastic, elasto-visco-plastic or visco-plastic. The ALE approach enables to compute the stresses inside the workpiece and to obtain the displacements of the workpiece borders. Two finite elements models are presented to illustrate: (i) A hybrid arc/laser welding simulation through the thermal and material <b>supply</b> <b>resolution,</b> (ii) A TIG welding simulation through the stress and strain mechanical resolution...|$|E

40|$|California heralded the New Year {{with a wave}} {{of rolling}} blackouts, {{spiraling}} wholesale electricity prices, and at least one utility bankruptcy. California, which symbolizes the electronic age and represents an eighth of the U. S. economy and its population, faces electricity supply issues not seen since the Great Depression and the collapse of the great utility holding companies. To what extent is California the bellwether for the restructured electric industry in the United States? We {{do not believe that the}} recent crisis in California is a signal that competition and deregulation have failed. Indeed, it remains our firm belief that market-oriented restructuring of the electric industry remains the best opportunity to provide consumer benefits and to develop reliable new sources of supply. After all, a major impetus for introducing competition into the generation and marketing of electricity has been the previous failures in long-term planning decisions made by public utilities and their regulators. The regulated monopoly regime simply did not provide the correct economic incentives for a company to provide electric service efficiently. To what extent can other states that have restructured their electric industries expect to see California-like dramatic sustained price increases and supply shortages resulting in rolling blackouts? The root cause of California's problems was its long-term failure to build generating plants during the most sustained economic boom in the state's history. California's most significant restructuring problem was also a local issue. The California restructuring law required utilities collecting stranded costs to retain fixed price obligations to retail customers, while preventing them from hedging their price risk in the wholesale market by entering into long-term supply contracts. The California market design flaws have been avoided in the restructuring legislation enacted by the twenty-four states and the District of Columbia that have restructured electricity markets. Among these states are Pennsylvania and Illinois, the states where Exelon conducts public utility businesses. The restructuring efforts in these other states are generally yielding results quite different from those in California and demonstrate that thoughtful, market-oriented, evolutionary restructuring can work well for all parties. This is not a reason, however, for complacency. Government agencies, utilities and all market stakeholders must work hard to make sure this answer remains valid a few years hence. This work includes establishing appropriate pricing and incentives to encourage the building of new supply and the development of demand-side management programs; establishing regional transmission organizations in order to support the expansion of and appropriate pricing for transmission; establishing appropriate rules and pricing regarding the utilities provider of last resort or default supply obligation. The default supply issue is one of the most significant challenges to the transition to competition. If the delivery companies retain primary responsibility for arranging supply and thus lock up most of the generation sources, the result is reliable service and stable rates for customers. However, new market entrants' access to supply sources will be limited and at high prices, making it difficult for them to compete. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a bifurcated approach to default service offerings and pricing. For large customers, who have the most desirable service characteristics to competitive suppliers and thus more opportunity to hedge their price risk, the utilities' only default service obligation would be unbundled energy at a market price. For mass market customers, who lack hedging ability because of limited, if any, market development, the utilities would provide a fixed price, multi-year energy supply offering. The price for both offerings must include a risk premium adequate to compensate the utility for the risk it assumes and to avoid rates that are too low to allow alternative suppliers to compete. We believe our default <b>supply</b> <b>resolution</b> will achieve the competing goals of price stability, reliability, and the development of a mature competitive market. The California experience is not an accident or the product of bad luck. It is the product of choices, long-term choices about siting generation and transmission, and the more recent choice of a market design that imposed asymmetric risks on utilities to the ultimate detriment of all. If other states make similar choices, similar consequences can be expected to follow. In short, the California experience is no reason to reject restructuring; it is rather a forceful lesson on the importance of doing it right. ...|$|E

40|$|Bridge sensors {{are widely}} used for {{accurate}} measurement of physical quantities such as temperature, pressure, strain or altitude. Such sensors require a low-noise, high-resolution and accurate readout system with high input impedance. In order to meet these requirements, conventional sensor readout systems use multiple stages which typically include a low-noise preamplifier, an anti-aliasing filter and a discrete-time (DT) sigma-delta modulator (??M). As a result, these systems involve several high-gain loops with total open-loop gain far exceeding the required closed-loop gain. This can lead to sub-optimal power dissipation and greater analog design complexity in design of a sensor readout system. In recent years, Gm-C continuous-time (CT) ??Ms have attracted {{a lot of attention}} due to their inherent anti-alias filtering, low power dissipation, high input impedance and high resolution. However, their use in precision applications such as bridge sensor readout is limited by the nonlinearity of the input stage. In this work, a new single-bit CT??M topology is proposed that employs an identical nonlinear element in the feedback path along with a low pass filter to enable nonlinearity compensation and achieve high linearity. A feedforward Gm stage further enhances the nonlinearity compensation by increasing the effective loop-gain. This approach enables more than 60 dB improvement in the nonlinearity of the input transconductor stage of the CT??M. A precision sensor readout circuit using the proposed CT??M architecture is designed and implemented in 0. 7 µm technology. The modulator achieves a resolution of 20 bits with a 22 nV/?Hz noise floor and an accuracy better than 10 ppm in post-layout simulations. It consumes 240 µA current from a 5 V <b>supply.</b> The <b>resolution</b> and accuracy of the CT??M designed in this work is comparable to that of state-of-the-art readout systems but with lower power dissipation and lesser analog complexity. The proposed modulators achieves 10 x better linearity and accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art Gm-C based CT??Ms, albeit at low frequencies, with significantly less noise and power dissipation.

We built an artificial pond system with two desiccation levels (high and low) and populated with tadpoles at Gosner stage 25. Each treatment was replicated six times. We measured the survival, size and age at metamorphosis, development rate and hind limb length in metamorphs. The results showed that tadpoles from the high desiccation ponds accelerated their development, reaching metamorphosis {{at an earlier age}} than tadpoles from the low desiccation ponds. Survival, size at metamorphosis and hind limb length were not different between treatments. This experiment demonstrated that tadpoles of R. spinulosa accelerate their development in response to habitat desiccation. Such plasticity may allow them to avoid mortality in short duration ponds. No evidence for a trade-off between development time and size at metamorphosis was found in this experiment. We suggest that factors such as initial tadpole density and nutritional quality of food would contribute towards determining whether metamorphosis occurs at the developmental threshold or at a larger size.

The excited state and reduced state intermediates were investigated in solution phase as references to confirm the charge injection and recombination on the NiO surface. The charge recombination kinetics is remarkably heterogeneous in some cases occurring on time scales spanning at least six orders of magnitude even for the same dye. In this thesis, we also proposed a novel concept of solid state p-type dye sensitized solar cells (p-ssDSSCs) for the first time (paper VI), using an organic dye P 1 as sensitizer on mesoporous NiO and phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as electron conductor.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original method for analyzing, in an unsupervised way, images <b>supplied</b> by high <b>resolution</b> sonar. We aim at segmenting the sonar image into {{three kinds of}} regions: echo areas (due to {{the reflection of the}} acoustic wave on the object), shadow areas (corresponding to a lack of acoustic reverberation behind an object lying on the sea-bed), and sea-bottom reverberation areas. This unsupervised method estimates the parameters of noise distributions, modeled by a Weibull probability density function (PDF), and the label field parameters, modeled by a Markov random field (MRF). For the estimation step, we adopt a maximum likelihood technique for the noise model parameters and a least-squares method to estimate the MRF prior model. Then, in order to obtain an accurate segmentation map, we have designed a two-step process that finds the shadow and the echo regions separately, using the previously estimated parameters. First, we introduce a scale-causal and spatial model called SCM (scale causal multigrid), based on a multigrid energy minimization strategy, to find the shadow class. Second, we propose a MRF monoscale model using a priori information (at different level of knowledge) based on physical properties of each region, which allows us to distinguish echo areas from seabottom reverberation. This technique has been successfully applied to real sonar images and is compatible with automatic processing of massive amounts of data. c ○ 1999 Academic Press Key Words: sonar imagery; unsupervised segmentation; MRF hierarchical model; Weibull law; noise model estimation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of embedded protoplanets in a protostellar disk using very high resolution nestedgrid computations. This method allows us to perform global simulations of planets orbiting in disks and, at the same time, to resolve in detail {{the dynamics of the}} flow inside the Roche lobe of the planet. The primary interest of this work lies in the analysis of the gravitational torque balance acting on the planet. For this purpose we study planets of different masses, ranging from one Earth-mass up to one Jupiter-mass, assuming typical parameters of the protostellar disk. The high <b>resolution</b> <b>supplied</b> by the nested-grid technique permits an evaluation of the torques, resulting from short and very short range disk-planet interactions, more reliable than the one previously estimated with the aid of numerical methods. Likewise, the mass flow onto the planet is computed in a more accurate fashion. The obtained migration time scales are in the range from few times 10 4 years, for intermediate mass planets, to 10 6 years, for very low and high mass planets. These are longer than earlier assessments due to the action of circumplanetary material. Typical growth time scales depend strongly on the planetary mass. Below 64 Earth-masses, we find this time scale to increase as the 2 / 3 -power of the planet’s mass; otherwise it rises as the 4 / 3 -power. In the case of Jupiter-size planets, the growth time scale is several times ten thousand years.

40|$|Among the new {{perspectives}} opened {{by the recent}} developments {{in the field of}} adptive structures is an interesting future for structural health monitoring. A structure with embedded actuators and sensors represents the best environment for an integrity assessment device based on the monitoring of the systems's vibrational behavior. For this purpose, an algorithm is needed that is able to extract reliable information from vibration measurements about the position and extent of damage in a structural system. This idea is not new; many contributions {{can be found in the}} literature. Nevertheless, until now no approach has established itself as the way to be followed. On the contrary, the opinion has become more and more popular that damage detection by modal techniques would be possible only with extremely accurate measurement results. The techniques examined in this paper give confidence to the possiblility of realizing a reliable modal damage diagnosis under normal measurement conditions and also when a small amount of measured modal data is available. A recently proposed detection approach, based on the measured eigenmodes, is completed here by a new method which supplies an independent diagnosis only on the basis of the measured eigenfrequencies. Both approaches require the availability of a reliable mathematical model of the undamaged structure. Numerically and experimentally tested on a cantilever beam, the approaches are virtually able to operate on all structurtes for which a modelization with the Finite Element is possible. The damage localization is <b>supplied</b> with a <b>resolution</b> that is correlated with the element dimensions in the model.

This has produced a high degree of diversity at the species level in some aquatic taxa (e. g., fish and amphibians), which suggests that these same processes have produced divergence at the intraspecific level in co-distributed taxa. We investigated the genetic variation in populations of the anuran Rhinella spinulosa which represent its entire distribution in the extreme north of Chile (17 ◦ 44 S- 23 ◦ 47 S). Haplotype networks of the mitochondrial control region recognized two main lineages, one of which is distributed from the northern boundary of Chile to the Salar de Alconcha and the other from the Salar de Carcote to the locality of Tilomonte. The northern lineage showed little phylogeographic structure; a few very frequent haplotypes are widely distributed. The southern lineage had greater structure, due principally to the high divergence of the populations from the eastern springs of the Salar de Atacama. Fu’s Fs test and the mismatch distributions suggested that most of the populations of both lineages {{are in the process of}} demographic expansion. The spatial distribution of the genetic variability was correlated with the hydrography and the paleoclimatological data available for the region, which suggested that geographic expansions followed by periods of contraction of population ranges, together with sporadic floods may explain the observed phylogeographic patterns.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the development of semiconductor microdosimetry and the most current (state-of-the-art) Silicon on Insulator (SOI) detectors for microdosimetry based mainly on research and development carried out at the Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP) at the Uni- versity of Wollongong with collaborators over the last 18 years. In this paper every generation of CMRP SOI microdosimeters, including their fabrication, design, and electrical and charge collection character- isation are presented. A study of SOI microdosimeters in various radiation ﬁelds has demonstrated that under appropriate geometrical scaling, the response of SOI detectors with the well-known geometry of microscopically sensitive volumes will record the energy deposition spectra representative of tissue cells of an equivalent shape. This development of SOI detectors for microdosimetry with increased complexity has improved the deﬁnition of microscopic sensitive volume (SV), which is modelling the deposition of ionising energy in a biological cell, that are led from planar to 3 D SOI detectors with an array of segmented microscopic 3 D SVs. The monolithic ΔE - E silicon telescope, which is an alternative to the SOI silicon microdosimeter, is presented, and as an example, applications of SOI detectors and ΔE - E monolithic telescope for microdosimetery in proton therapy ﬁeld and equivalent neutron dose mea- surements out of ﬁeld are also presented. An SOI microdosimeter “bridge” with 3 D SVs can derive the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) in 12 C ion radiation therapy that matches the tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) quite well, but with outstanding spatial resolution. The use of SOI tech- nology in experimental microdosimetry offers simplicity (no gas system or HV <b>supply),</b> high spatial <b>resolution,</b> low cost, high count rates, and the possibility of integrating the system onto a single device with other types of detector...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{the first}} {{comprehensive}} investigation of the issues confronting silicon microdosimetry and its application to radiotherapy. Four main problems requiring investigation are identified and addressed including requirement specification with particular emphasis on device shape, tissue equivalence, noise minimization, andsensitive volume definition. Analysis of device shape showed that a rectangular parallelepiped with a tissue equivalent converter on top of device (i. e. a silicon microdosimeter) provides a lineal energy spectrum that is closely equivalent to a sphere using the criteria of equal dose mean lineal energy. The tissue equivalent study demonstrated that under appropriate geometrical scaling (dimensions multiplied by 1 / 0. 63) silicon detectors with well known geometry will record energy deposition spectra representative of tissue cells of equivalent shape. A novel prototype device using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) is presented. Silicon-on-insulator technology assists in defining the sensitive volume depth although the current device still suffers from lateral diffusion effects. I-V and C-V testing are performed and a noise optimization design model is presented. Methods for characterizing the collection efficiency and radiation hardness of silicon microdosimeters are presented and compared including alpha and proton microbeam spectroscopy, broadbeam alpha spectroscopy and 2 D and 3 D device simulation. Results from testing the low noise prototype SOI device at several high LET clinical facilities including BNCT, proton therapy and fast neutron therapy facilities are presented. In the BNCT experiments, a simultaneous thermal neutron flux and microdosimetric measurement at a high spatial resolution is demonstrated. The use of SOI technology in experimental microdosimetry offers simplicity (no gas system or HV <b>supply),</b> high spatial <b>resolution,</b> low cost, high count rate capability {{and the possibility of}} integrating the system onto a single device with other detector types.

40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of a structural system is influenced by damage to the structure. Extraction of reliable information about the position and extent of damage from vibration measurement results would transform modal analysis into an attractive tool for non-destructive assessment of structural integrity. The advantages of a modal approach for structural health monitoring would be remarkable {{for a wide range}} of applications: aircraft, space structures, off-shore platforms, and basically all systems characterized by limited accessibility and high inspection costs. Therefore, it is no wonder that in the last few decades much research has been done in this field. In spite of the simplicity of the basic idea, until now no approach has established itself as the way to be followed. On the contrary, the opinion that damage detection by modal techniques would be possible only with extremely accurate measurement results has become more and more popular. The new technique proposed in this paper performs the damage detection on the basis of measured modal properties of the structure, with the prerequisite that a reliable mathematical model of the undamaged structure is available. The method is virtually able to operate on all structures for which a modelization with the finite element method is possible. The damage localization is <b>supplied</b> with a <b>resolution</b> which is correlated with the element dimensions in the model. The quality of the detection is influenced by the accuracy of the measured modal parameters, as well as by the amount of available data. In order to verify the proposed method, some numerical simulations and experimental tests were performed on a cantilever beam. This paper presents some of the results. Not only large zones of stiffness degradation, but also small cracks are successfully detected in the test structure...|$|R
