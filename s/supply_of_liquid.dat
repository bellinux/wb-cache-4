5|$|The {{government}} of the United States set up the National Helium Reserve in 1925 at Amarillo, Texas, {{with the goal of}} supplying military airships in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime. Because of the Helium Control Act (1927), which banned the export of scarce helium on which the US then had a production monopoly, together with the prohibitive cost of the gas, the Hindenburg, like all German Zeppelins, was forced to use hydrogen as the lift gas. The helium market after World War II was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> helium as a coolant to create oxygen/hydrogen rocket fuel (among other uses) during the Space Race and Cold War. Helium use in the United States in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption.|$|E

For that purpose I modify a standard asset pricing model by allowing certain groups of assets to directly contribute to utility. Empirical tests of the model's implications con firm that view and show that changes in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> more <b>liquid</b> and safe assets cause a stronger impact on corporate-Treasury yield spreads compared to changes in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> less <b>liquid</b> and safe assets.

40|$|Harvesting, {{the largest}} {{consumer}} {{of energy in}} Pinus radiata D. Don planta-tion operations, is dependent on liquid fuel.
