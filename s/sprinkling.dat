5|$|Reformed Christians {{believe that}} {{immersion}} {{is not necessary}} for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or <b>sprinkling</b> are acceptable. <b>Sprinkling</b> is said to symbolize the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood of Christ {{for the removal of}} the guilt of sin. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, contrary to the allowance for emergency baptism by midwives in Roman Catholic churches, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (such as the use of chrism, salt, and insufflation), accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains. They do not rebaptize someone who has been baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never to be repeated.|$|E
5|$|Reformed Christians believe baptism to {{be a sign}} of regeneration, or {{the making}} of one into a new creature, based on the {{connection}} found in the New Testament between regeneration and washing with water. Baptism also represents forgiveness or remission of sin by the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood of Christ, similarly to the <b>sprinkling</b> of blood of sacrificial animals. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. However, Reformed theologians do not teach that baptism is necessarily bound to the forgiveness of sins. Not everyone who participates in the outward rite of baptism can be said to has had their sins forgiven. Rather, it is necessary that the baptized person participate spiritually by faith in order to receive this benefit.|$|E
5|$|Apotropaics—items able to {{ward off}} revenants—are common in vampire folklore. Garlic is a common example, a branch of wild rose and {{hawthorn}} plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, <b>sprinkling</b> mustard seeds {{on the roof of}} a house was said to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a crucifix, rosary, or holy water. Vampires are said to be unable to walk on consecrated ground, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Sprinkle</b> Spangles mascot was the <b>Sprinkle</b> Genie (voiced by Dom DeLuise). He {{would often}} appear {{in front of}} {{children}} who wished they had <b>sprinkles</b> for breakfast. The <b>Sprinkle</b> Genie's own catchphrase was: [...] "You wish it, I dish it!" [...] The mascot was dropped before the cereal was retired.|$|R

5|$|Hair {{opened at}} the Shaftesbury Theatre in London on September 27, 1968, led by the same {{creative}} team as the Broadway production. The opening night was delayed until the abolition of theatre censorship in England under the Theatres Act 1968 so that the show could include nudity and profanity. As with other early productions, the London show added a <b>sprinkling</b> of local allusions and other minor departures from the Broadway version.|$|E
5|$|Hindus form around 65% of the {{population}} according to 2001 census. Muslims are about 33% of {{the population}}. There is a <b>sprinkling</b> of other religious groups in the population.

5000|$|Some American {{manufacturers}} deem the elongated opaque <b>sprinkles</b> {{the official}} <b>sprinkles.</b> In British English, these are sugar strands or hundreds-and-thousands (the latter term alludes to their supposed uncountability). In the Northeastern United States, <b>sprinkles</b> are {{often referred to}} as jimmies. [...] "Jimmies", in this sense, are usually considered to be used as an ice cream topping, while <b>sprinkles</b> are for decorating baked goods, but the term can be used for both.|$|R
5|$|In Birkenau, Vrba had {{encountered}} an acquaintance from Trnava, Alfréd Wetzler (prisoner no.29162), {{who was working}} in the mortuary. The two men hatched an escape plan, and on 7 April 1944, with the help of two other prisoners, they hid inside a pile of wood stacked between the camp's inner and outer perimeter fences, <b>sprinkling</b> the area with tobacco soaked in gasoline to fool the dogs.|$|E
5|$|Further {{measures}} included pouring {{boiling water}} over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by <b>sprinkling</b> holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could {{be placed in the}} mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.|$|E
5|$|Impa {{says that}} the mark on Link's hand means {{that he is the}} hero chosen to awaken Zelda. She gives Link a chest {{containing}} six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of Hyrule can read. Link finds that he can read the document, even though he has never seen the language before; it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces scattered all over Hyrule. This will open the way to the Great Palace, which contains the Triforce of Courage. Only the power of the combined Triforces can awaken the enchanted Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, the followers of Ganon are seeking to kill Link, as <b>sprinkling</b> his blood on Ganon’s ashes will bring Ganon back to life.|$|E
50|$|Some {{say that}} the General Mills <b>Sprinkled</b> Cookie Crisp Cereal (Released in 2009) tastes {{very similar to the}} retired <b>Sprinkle</b> Spangles cereal.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sprinkle</b> Spangles was a {{short-lived}} breakfast cereal by General Mills. It {{was introduced in}} the early 90s, alongside Hidden Treasures. The cereal was of star-shaped pieces covered with multi-colored <b>sprinkles.</b> The commercials claimed that they [...] "Spangled every angle with sprinkles." [...] <b>Sprinkle</b> Spangles were no longer available in 1998.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sprinkle</b> {{commenced}} her {{profession in}} the conventional porn business in the mid 1970s, slowly shifting to directing her own pictures, such as Deep Inside Annie <b>Sprinkle.</b> In the 1990s <b>Sprinkle</b> became largely involved in creating films, performances, and publications that were openly feminist and that participated in a playful and new form that involved women's, queer, and transgender sexuality. The majority of Annie <b>Sprinkle’s</b> works consists of several self-help-styles videos for example, such as Annie <b>Sprinkle's</b> Amazing World of Orgasm (U.S., 2004) and The Sluts and Goddesses Video Workshop (U.S., 1992), in which <b>Sprinkle</b> is portrayed as a skilled “sexpert”, motivating the audience to test out a range of elements of their own pleasures and fantasies. In the 1990s Annie <b>Sprinkle</b> became extensively renowned because she had switched from conventional porn to a feminist performance practice that combined live shows, writings on sexuality, and instructional videos. Yet, Deep Inside Annie <b>Sprinkle,</b> the initial film that <b>Sprinkle</b> both starred in and directed, had already shared several similar traits that later became hallmarks for her later works. These fundamentals incorporated an autobiographical emphasis, in which she displays to the viewer genuine photographs of her youth at the commencement of the film, for instance and the significance of women's self-satisfaction. Deep Inside, in distinction to <b>Sprinkle's</b> productions from the 1990s forward, was still advertised to conventional porn viewers, and extremely productively. Thus, it became the second leading grossing porn film of 1981. Annie <b>Sprinkles</b> also becamse {{well known in the}} queer art movement for being the first to promote the term [...] "postporn", and because she co-signed the Post-Porn Manifesto in 1989. Postporn became a niche term in the 80s and 90s, and continues to be an influential praxis in the transfeminist and queer movements, specifically in the fields of contemporary video and performance art.|$|R
5|$|Rear Admiral George Pettengill {{relieved}} Bryant on 4 March 1935 and {{the ship}} participated in Fleet Problem XVI two months later. Arizona made a port visit to Balboa, Panama, in May 1936 during Fleet Problem XVII. On 8 June, Captain George A. Alexander relieved Baum as captain, and, 15 days later, Rear Admiral Claude C. Bloch relieved Pettengill. During gunnery practice on 24 July, the combustion gases from one gun of Turret II entered the gun turret, burning one crewman. The turret's <b>sprinkling</b> system was turned on to prevent any powder explosion, but the water leaked into the turret's electrical switchboard and started a small fire that was easily put out. Due to the navy's limited budget, the ship spent most of this period in port as a fuel-saving measure. In Fiscal Year 1936–37, the ship was anchored for 267 days; the following year it was in port for 255 days. The ship {{spent the rest of}} her career based on the West Coast or in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Some {{effective}} {{techniques for}} the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage. The latter include covering of openings such as: air and water intakes, aircraft engines and windows during ash fall events. Roads may be closed to allow clean-up of ash falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall. To prevent further effects on underground water systems or waste water networks, drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system. Ash can be moistened (but not saturated) by <b>sprinkling</b> with water, to prevent remobilisation of ash and to aid clean-up. Prioritisation of clean-up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean-up efforts also constitute good management practice.|$|E
5|$|Tangled Ever After is set {{six months}} after the events of the {{original}} movie. In the short, Pascal and Maximus are ring bearers at Rapunzel and Flynn Rider's wedding. When Maximus suffers a reaction from one of the flower petals Pascal is <b>sprinkling</b> along the aisle, Maximus sneezes and the rings are propelled off the pillow on which he is carrying the rings; the fly through a window in the chapel and into the city streets. Pascal and Maximus discreetly sneak out of the chapel to retrieve them in time for Rapunzel and Flynn to exchange them. Pascal and Maximus encounter several obstacles and hindrances in their attempt, eventually crashing into a tar factor upon retrieving the rings from a flock of flying doves. Completely soiled, Pascal and Maximus finally return to the chapel and return the rings, only to cause the wedding cake to roll out the door.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between Edward and Wallis Simpson blossomed at Fort Belvedere; the couple spent their first {{weekend at the}} fort {{at the end of}} January 1932, and by early 1935 two rooms had been combined at the fort for her use. Notable interior decorators to work on the fort under Edward included Sybil Colefax, Lady Mendl, Maison Jansen, and Herman Schrijver. Edward and Wallis entertained most weekends at the house; guests present included 'courtiers and diplomats, American men of affairs and English Society, garnished with a <b>sprinkling</b> of statesmen, soldiers and sailors'. Giles Gilbert Scott added a guest wing to the fort after Edward's accession as king in 1936. In 1936 Wallis moved permanently to the fort after receiving threatening anonymous letters, and left Fort Belvedere for the final time on 3 December 1936, a week before Edward's abdication.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{initiation}} proper, Lucius must undergo {{a series of}} ritual purifications. The priest bathes him, asks the gods for forgiveness on his behalf, and sprinkles him with water. This confession of and repentance for past sins fits {{with an emphasis on}} chastity and other forms of self-denial found in many other sources about the Isis cult. Lucius next has to wait ten days, while abstaining from meat and wine, before {{the initiation}} begins. Purifying baths were common in many rituals across the Greco-Roman world. The plea for forgiveness, however, may derive from the oaths that Egyptian priests were required to take, in which they declared themselves to be free of wrongdoing. The <b>sprinkling</b> with water and the refraining from certain foods probably come from the purification rituals that those priests had to undergo before entering a temple. On the evening of the final day, Lucius receives a variety of gifts from fellow devotees of Isis before donning a clean linen robe and entering the deepest part of the temple.|$|E
5|$|German {{scholar and}} folklorist Wilhelm Mannhardt {{holds that the}} log {{represented}} an incarnation {{of the spirit of}} vegetation. The sacrifices offered to the badnjak were meant to guarantee the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. Its burning symbolized sunshine, and was intended to secure the vitalizing power of the sun in the ensuing year. The lighting of the log could be regarded as a fusion of tree worship and fire worship, attested in Slavic customs; e.g., Istrians fed the logs lighted on St. John's Day by <b>sprinkling</b> wheat upon them. Čajkanović characterizes the pre-Christian badnjak as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, comparing it in this respect with Attis, Osiris, Adonis, and Sandan. He also proposes that the crosses made from the thicker end of the log may have originated from idols representing deities comparable with the Roman Lares, the cruciform having developed from an anthropomorphic shape of the idols. The badnjak is preferably cut from an oak, which was the most respected tree in the old Slavic religion, associated with the supreme god Perun.|$|E
5000|$|Another story {{attributes}} the name [...] "jimmies" [...] to Dr. Sidney Farber and Edward Brigham. Dr. Farber co-founded the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts {{as well as}} a charity named after one of his child patients, The Jimmy Fund. Edward Brigham opened an ice cream restaurant called Brigham’s and charged an extra penny for chocolate <b>sprinkles</b> on a cone, which benefited The Jimmy Fund. The fund however was started in 1948, well after the first historical reference. <b>Sprinkles</b> is also the name of a youtube character (<b>Sprinkle</b> Cupcakes). <b>Sprinkle</b> Bits is a Youtube series.|$|R
