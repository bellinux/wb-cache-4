5|$|On 30December, the JTWC {{reported}} that Rewa had become {{equivalent to a}} category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS); early {{the next day the}} BoM {{reported that}} the system had developed into a category 3severe tropical cyclone, and an eye became visible on satellite imagery. The system then abruptly turned and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> towards the south parallel to the Queensland coast because of an interaction with an upper-level trough of low pressure. On 2January both the JTWC and the BoM reported that Rewa had reached its peak intensity, with the JTWC reporting that Rewa had peaked with 1-minute windspeeds of 230km/h (145mph), equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS. Meanwhile, the BoM reported that the system had peaked with 10-minute windspeeds of 205km/h (125mph) with a central pressure of , which made it a category 5severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale. Rewa remained at its peak intensity for 24hours before the system started to weaken during 3January, as strengthening upper level north-westerlies increased vertical wind shear over the system. Throughout that day, the cyclone <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> towards the south-east, before it started to take a more eastwards track as it approached 160°E.|$|E

During the 1970s and 1980s, however, many {{businesses}} <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{from the city}} center, and the downtown area entered an economic and social decline. Sears and J.C. Penney left the downtown area in 1979 to open up as anchor stores in the new Flagstaff Mall, joined in 1986 by Dillard's. By 1987, the Babbitt Brothers Trading Company, which had been a retail fixture in Flagstaff since 1891, had closed its doors at Aspen Avenue and San Francisco Street.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1948, Jhangar, lost in December 1947 to the Pakistanis, was recaptured by {{troops of}} the Indian Army, which then <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> towards Rajauri from Naushahra sector. On 8 April 1948, the 4th Dogra Battalion {{advanced}} to Rajauri. During the advance, the battalion attacked and captured the Barwali ridge, eleven kilometers {{to the north of}} Naushahra. The battalion's advance beyond Barwali was obstructed by the increasing number of roadblocks and minefields. Supporting tanks were also unable to cross the obstacles.|$|E
5|$|On March 19, the JTWC {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} disturbance that was located about 1145km (710mi) {{to the northwest}} of Suva, Fiji. Over {{the next couple of}} days the system moved towards the south and gradually developed further in an area of low vertical windshear, before the system was designated as Tropical Depression 23P by the JTWC and RSMC Nadi on March 21. Over {{the next couple of days}}, 23P moved further towards the south, before the depression <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> towards the southwest as a ridge of high pressure strengthened on March 23. Later that day, RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it as Beti. During that day, Beti continued to develop further before the system moved into the Coral Sea on March 24, after passing over the Vanuatuan islands of Pentecost and Malekula. As Beti moved into the Coral Sea, the system quickly intensified further, with RSMC Nadi reporting on March 25 that Beti had intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. As Beti intensified into a severe tropical cyclone, the ridge of high pressure weakened as it interacted with an upper level trough of low pressure. As a result, the system <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> towards the south-southeast.|$|E

5|$|That {{afternoon}} three {{troops of}} tanks from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, {{were sent to}} reinforce the Black Watch, but they had only just <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> towards the Château when three tanks were destroyed by hidden German self-propelled guns. The other tanks were withdrawn being unable to deploy in the wooded ground around the Château. The {{rest of the day}} and night passed without another attack, but the Germans sent out reconnaissance patrols to establish the exact location of the British positions and German armoured vehicles could be heard moving up to the front during the night.|$|E
5|$|After Dieppe the {{headquarters}} staff changed again. Lovat {{was promoted to}} brigadier and given command of the 1st Special Service Brigade. Mills-Roberts was promoted and sent to North Africa to take over command of No. 6 Commando. They were replaced by Robert Dawson as the CO and Ronald Menday as 2IC. Other changes included moving to a new base in Falmouth {{and the formation of}} a heavy weapons troop in each commando. The new troop with mortar and Vickers machine gun sections provided the heavy weapons needed for their new role as assault infantry. By now the Commandos had <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into units intended to spearhead future Allied landing operations. To assist in this they were given the organic fire support weapons, that had been absent when they were a raiding force.|$|E
5|$|Bittrich {{ordered a}} {{resumption}} of the offensive {{during the night}} of 29–30 June, hoping to avoid Allied air support. The 19th and 20th Regiments of the 9th SS Panzer Division, renewed their attacks against Grainville-sur-Odon and le Valtru in the dark but little progress was made against the 11th Armoured Division north of the Odon and heavy British artillery bombardments. At 0120, the 10th SS Panzer Division <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> towards Hill 112 and at dawn, covered by a heavy artillery barrage they assaulted the vacated British positions. Unaware that the British had pulled back, Panzergrenadiers and tanks of the 10th SS Panzer advanced on the hill {{from the south and}} south-west and infantry from 12th SS Panzer attacked from the east and south-east. Meeting no opposition, by noon the Germans had occupied the hill. A British counter-attack and artillery fire broke up a follow-up attack towards Baron-sur-Odon.|$|E

5|$|By now the Commandos <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{away from}} smaller raiding operations. They were formed into four brigades to {{spearhead}} future Allied landing operations. The previous Special Service Brigade Headquarters {{was replaced by}} Headquarters Special Services Group under command of Major General Robert Sturges. Of the remaining 20 Commando units, 17 {{were used in the}} formation of the four Special Service brigades. The three remaining Commandos (Nos. 12, 14, and 62) were left out of the brigade structure to concentrate on smaller scale raids. The increased tempo of operations, together with a shortage of volunteers and the need to provide replacements for casualties, forced their disbandment by the end of 1943. The small scale raiding role was then given to the two French troops of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando.|$|E
5|$|While {{over land}} the system moved towards the {{south-southwest}} {{and moved into}} the Bligh Waters, where it started to rapidly intensify as convection erupted around the system. As a result, before the system made landfall on Viti Levu, RSMC Nadi reported that the system had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone, on the Australian cyclone intensity scale and named it Gene. The system then made landfall shortly after 0600UTC near Lautoka, before it <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> westwards and passed near Nadi before it {{moved out of the}} archipelago. Early on January 29 as the system moved westwards, RSMC Nadi reported that Gene had intensified into a category two tropical cyclone before it briefly weakened into a Category 1 because of the effects of a moderate amount of vertical windshear. However, the system quickly reintensified and by 1200UTC the next day had become a category 3 Severe Tropical Cyclone and equivalent to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E
5|$|During {{the opening}} days of 1994, Rewa moved southwards {{parallel}} to the Queensland coast; however, because it was located about 600km (370mi) to the north-east of Mackay, it {{was too far away}} from the coast for there to be any direct impact on Queensland. The only indirect impact was higher surf, from which several people had to be rescued from before the cyclone <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> towards New Caledonia during 4January. As Rewa affected Queensland for the second time, watches and warnings were issued for various parts of Queensland by TCWC Brisbane, who predicted a landfall near Mackay. On 18 January local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people, while people who were on vacation in national parks were alerted about Rewa by a helicopter. A military training exercise that was due to take place in Shoalwater Bay had to be cancelled, with army personal evacuated to Rockhampton to avoid being cut off by flood waters. Along the coast, several ports including Gladstone were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to batten down and prepare for the storm.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September, {{the brigade}} {{was once again}} moved to the front line and given {{responsibility}} for patrolling the area between the Desert Mounted Corps and the XXI Corps, taking under command the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment on 20 October. At the time the brigade was the only mounted formation not under the direct command of the Desert Mounted Corps, remaining Army Troops. The next British attack was the capture of Gaza in November 1917; the plan was for the infantry to capture their initial objectives, then the brigade would be released to advance along the Mediterranean coastline, turn right and attack the Turkish rear and their headquarters at Nuzzle. When the battle started, the British infantry captured {{all but one of}} their objectives, but as the brigade <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> out, a Turkish counter-attack regained their previous positions, so the brigade's advance was called off. However, by the night of 6/7 November, continued British attacks forced the Turkish to withdraw from Gaza and the brigade was ordered forward to pursue them. By 13:00 the brigade was north of Gaza when the Mysore Lancers' leading squadron located the Turkish rearguard, which included a heavy machine-gun position. At 15:00 the Hyderabad Lancers and the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment attacked Beit Hanun, {{while the rest of the}} brigade attacked Beit Lahi. As the Hyderabad Lancers approached their objective, they came under a heavy artillery bombardment. Leaving one squadron and their machine-guns behind to provide fire support, the rest of the Lancers attacked, capturing the Wadi Safieh line. The Lancers, still under artillery fire, held out until 16:30, when they were ordered to withdraw and rejoin the rest of the brigade now concentrated at Beit Lahi.|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{was one of}} Mozart 's pups seen on Meerkat Manor. She had two {{brothers}} and one sister named Sparkle. Only one of her brothers was given a name and he was called Spud. They were born some time after Tosca, Mozart's sister, gave birth to three pups. Their uncle Yossarian decided to move their pups who {{were only a few}} days old. He brought each up above ground and <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> them to a new burrow. The babysitters followed him and carried each pup. The Whiskers returned and Yossarian dropped the pup he was carrying, who was Sophie's sister. Her sister got left behind and died later that night. The other pups were moved to the new burrow. One day, while being babysat by Yossarian, Mitch, Sophie's other uncle, viciously attacked her without warning. Yossarian failed to stop the assault and simply waited until Mitch was proud of the beating. Afterwards, little Sophie {{was in a state of}} shock, but thankfully Tosca gave Sophie a comforting cuddle. Sophie didn't re-appear in the series until much later, when she was older. She was seen babysitting a litter, but was finding them a bit of a handful. That was the last time Sophie was mentioned in Season 1. In this season and up until season 3, she was played by Tina Sparkle since the real Sophie was the one Youssarian unintentionally killed.|$|E
