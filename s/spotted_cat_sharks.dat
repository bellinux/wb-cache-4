40|$|International audienceThe <b>cat</b> <b>shark</b> is {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} model for Chondrichthyes, an evolutionarily important sister group of the bony vertebrates that include teleosts and tetrapods. In the bony vertebrates, the first axon tracts form a highly conserved early axon scaffold. The corresponding structure has not been well characterised in <b>cat</b> <b>shark</b> and will prove a useful model for comparative studies. Using pan-neural markers, the early axon scaffold of the <b>cat</b> <b>shark,</b> Scyliorhinus canicula, was analysed. Like in other vertebrates, the medial longitudinal fascicle was the first axon tract to form from a small cluster of neurones in the ventral brain. Subsequently, additional neuronal clusters and axon tracts emerged which formed an array of longitudinal, transversal, and commissural axons tracts in the Scyliorhinus canicula embryonic brain. The first structures to appear after the medial longitudinal fascicle were the tract of the postoptic commissure, the dorsoventral diencephalic tract, and the descending tract of the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. These results confirm that the early axon scaffold in the embryonic brain is highly conserved through vertebrate evolution...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the stifle joints of little <b>spotted</b> <b>cats</b> in captivity using radiographic and CT studies. The hypothesis was that these animals would have meniscal mineralisation that could be detectable by imaging studies. Twelve intact little <b>spotted</b> <b>cats</b> (Leopardus tigrinus), 2 females and 10 males, aged from 1. 5 to 11. 11 years old and weighing 1. 9 - 3. 05 kg were studied. These animals, which were living in the Quinzinho de Barros Municipal Zoo, had no symptoms or known disease processes at the time of the study. The plain radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans of both stifle joints were performed under general anaesthesia. Sequential transverse images were acquired on a spiral scanner. Results: No signs of articular disease were observed in any of the animals. Radiographically, the meniscal mineralisation was detected as an oval radiopacity in the cranial compartment on the mediolateral projection, located within the area of the medial meniscus. On craniocaudal projection, the mineralisation was more difficult to visualise. In one of the animals, it was not possible to identify the meniscal mineralisation in either of the stifle joints. Using CT, meniscal mineralisation was best identified in the transverse plane images. Conclusions: Meniscal mineralisation appears to be a normal anatomic feature in little <b>spotted</b> <b>cats.</b> © 2013 Rahal et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
