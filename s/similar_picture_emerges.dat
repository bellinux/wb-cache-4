The decade 1996 – 2006 is a temporary short-lived break to the dismal overall divergent long run picture. Over this period, there is indeed a convergent behavior of Greek GDP. However, this is a period characterized by many factors, e.g., the pre-EMU entry fiscal consolidation efforts, a positive wealth effect associated with the overvaluation of the drachma upon entry, and the Olympic games. All these factors are not related to the frictions implied by the “insider–outsider society” politico-economic explanation we propose. These frictions, discussed and empirically investigated in this paper, existed beforehand and still remain intact. In other words, in the absence of these frictions, the observed convergence would be, most likely, more prominent and sustainable.|$|E

40|$|Spatial-frequency tuning at two {{different}} spatial frequencies {{was determined by}} measuring the detectability of a signal grating that was made difficult to see by low- or high-pass visual noise. The signals were vertical sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. The detectability of the signal was measured in two-alternative forced-choice tasks with different temporal envelopes: (1) a slowly changing raised-cosine (Hanning) window, (2) a rectangularly gated 2 -Hz counterphase flickering envelope, and (3) a rectangularly gated 10 -Hz counterphase flickering envelope. Additional measurements were made using drifting stimuli with the signal and noise drifting in the same or in opposite directions. The temporal envelopes were chosen because they have different effects on the contrast-sensitivity function and it was desired to know how temporal factors affect the spatial-frequency tuning of the relatively narrowly tuned channels thought to underlie contrast sensitivity. The results show that, for counterphase flickering stimuli, spatial-frequency tuning {{does not depend on}} temporal envelopes applied identical-ly to the signal and to the masking noise.

A <b>similar</b> <b>picture</b> <b>emerges</b> in fuzzball models of black holes in string theory, as well as the recent firewall proposal to resolve the information paradox. We then demonstrate that positing a surface fluid in thermal equilibrium with Hawking radiation, with vanishing energy density (but non-vanishing pressure) at the new boundary of spacetime, which is required by Israel junction conditions, yields a thermodynamic entropy that is identical to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law, $S_{BH}$, for charged rotating black holes. To our knowledge, this is the first derivation of black hole entropy which only employs local thermodynamics. Furthermore, a model for the microscopic degrees of freedom of the surface fluid (which constitute the micro-states of the black hole) is suggested, which has a finite, but Lorentz-violating, quantum field theory. Finally, we comment on the effects of physical boundary on Hawking radiation, and show that relaxing the assumption of equilibrium with Hawking radiation sets $S_{BH}$ as an upper limit for Black Hole entropy.

Our primary intention with this special issue is to challenge these basic assumptions by problematizing this body of knowledge (Alvesson and Sandberg, 2011). Specifically, our proposed alternative is premised {{on the fact that}} the realities of organizational life do not reflect such a neat juxtaposition. For instance, Gray and colleagues (2011) demonstrate that sadness motivates the positive behavior of building social connections. In an earlier example, Storbeck and Clore (2005) show that happiness actually impedes memory accuracy (i. e., positive emotion having a negative outcome). In a similar vein, Lindebaum and Fielden&# 39;s (2011) study partly dispels the myth that anger is always related to negative outcomes at work. That is, anger was related to perceived leader success in the context of the construction industry.

Precision-cut rat liver slices were incubated with benzo[a]pyrene alone or in combination {{with a range of}} concentrations of a second PAH, and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 B 1 mRNA levels determined. Concurrent incubation of benzo[a]pyrene with either dibenzo[a,h]anthracene or fluoranthene in liver slices led to a synergistic interaction, at least at low concentrations, in that ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity was statistically higher than the added effects when the slices were incubated with the individual compounds. In contrast, benzo[b]fluoranthene and, at high doses only, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene gave rise to antagonism, whereas 1 -methylphenanthrene had no effect at all concentrations studied. When CYP 1 A 1 mRNA levels were monitored, benzo[b]fluoranthene gave rise to an antagonistic response when incubated with benzo[a]pyrene, whereas all other compounds displayed synergism, with 1 -methylphenathrene being the least effective.

It distinguishes the contribution of five factors: private capital, infrastructure, education, trade integration, and net efficiency. Several relatively small handicaps, combined multiplicatively, can make a country poor or very poor. In average, the average productivity of the industrial sector is indeed the product of about five times 70 %. But 0. 70 to the power of five is 17 %. The least productive country in the sample, Bangladesh, has a productivity level worth about 2 % of that of the richest nations. From this perspective, industry is not much different from aggregate GDP such as analysed in Cohen and Soto (2004) where a <b>similar</b> <b>picture</b> <b>emerged</b> The paper then sheds light on the effect of TFP differential between industry and GDP at large on the relative price of manufactured goods.

So far as manufacturing is concerned the paper highlights an "anti-Lucas" paradox whereby the capital output ratio is higher in poor countries than in rich countries. This result tends to deflate the theories according to which fear of expropriation is the critical explanation of the low level of capital in the economy at large. industry; Lucas Paradox; productivity...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{descriptions}} of gait impairments {{have been reported}} in cerebral palsy (CP), but it is still unclear how maturation of the spinal motoneuron output is affected. Spatiotemporal alpha-motoneuron activation during walking can be assessed by mapping the electromyographic activity profiles from several, simultaneously recorded muscles onto the anatomical rostrocaudal location of the motoneuron pools in the spinal cord, and by means of factor analysis of the muscle activity profiles. Here, we analysed gait kinematics and EMG activity of 11 pairs of bilateral muscles with lumbosacral innervation in 35 children with CP (19 diplegic, 16 hemiplegic, 2 - 12 years) and 33 typically developing (TD) children (1 - 12 years). TD children showed a progressive reduction of EMG burst durations and a gradual reorganization of the spatiotemporal motoneuron output with increasing age. By contrast, children with CP showed very limited age-related changes of EMG durations and motoneuron output, as well as of limb intersegmental coordination and foot trajectory control (on both sides for diplegic children and the affected side for hemiplegic children). Factorization of the EMG signals revealed a comparable structure of the motor output in children with CP and TD children, but significantly wider temporal activation patterns in children with CP, resembling the patterns of much younger TD infants. A <b>similar</b> <b>picture</b> <b>emerged</b> when considering the spatiotemporal maps of alpha-motoneuron activation. Overall, the results are consistent with the idea that early injuries to developing motor regions of the brain substantially affect the maturation of the spinal locomotor output and consequently the future locomotor behaviour...|$|R

We probe the physical conditions of a two-component molecular interstellar medium in each galaxy and each kinematic component by using molecular line ratio diagnostics in three complementary ways. First, we measure the ratios of the position-velocity diagrams of different lines, second we measure the ratios of each kinematic component’s integrated line intensities as a function of projected position, and third we model these line ratios using a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer code. Overall, the nuclear discs appear to have a tenuous molecular gas component that is hotter, optically thinner and with a larger dense gas fraction than that in the inner rings, suggesting more dense clumps immersed in a hotter more diffuse molecular medium. This is consistent with evidence that the physical conditions in the nuclear discs are similar to those in photo-dissociation regions.

Second, a <b>similar</b> <b>picture</b> <b>emerges</b> for the large banks of other countries. The optimal capital ratios are always above the minimum equity requirements of the BCBS. Third, results vary across studies. With the exception of Brooke et al. (2015), all studies estimate optimal capital ratios above 15 %. This difference mainly results from a different understanding of loss-absorbing bank capital. As in all the other studies, Brooke et al. (2015) estimate the optimal capital ratios {{on the basis of}} going concern equity capital because bank equity is the only reliable loss absorber in financial crises. Other forms of capital, in particular hybrid capital, failed in the financial crisis of 2007 / 2008. Nevertheless, Brooke et al. (2015) make a general downward adjustment of their optimal capital ratios to reflect the regulatory requirement that banks have to meet gone concern capital in addition to the going concern bank equity. 31 Gone concern capital is equity-like capital such as subordinated debt subject to bail-in. Its intention is to provide capital for failed banks in order to recapitalize, restructure, or wind them down without using taxpayer funds. Moreover, from a conceptional point of view, it is not appropriate to mix going and gone concern capital considerations as it would imply not only a different cost curve but also a benefit curve that includes two objectives: (i) the reduction of crisis probability due to higher equity capital and (ii) the benefits of an orderly resolution due to gone concern capital.|$|E

40|$|The paper reports an {{experimental}} study of the flow structure over an immobile gravel bed in open channel at intermediate submergence, with particular focus on the near-bed region. The experiments consisted of velocity measurements using three-component (stereoscopic) Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in near-bed horizontal plane and two-component PIV in three vertical planes that covered three distinctly different hydraulic scenarios where the ratio of flow depth to roughness height (i. e., relative submergence) changes from 7. 5 to 10. 8. Detailed velocity measurements were supplemented with fine-scale bed elevation data obtained with a laser scanner. The data revealed longitudinal low-momentum and high-momentum "strips" in the time-averaged velocity field, likely induced by secondary currents. This depth-scale pattern was superimposed with particle-scale patches of flow heterogeneity induced by gravel particle protrusions. A <b>similar</b> <b>picture</b> <b>emerged</b> when considering second-order velocity moments. The interaction between the flow field and gravel-bed protrusions is assessed using cross correlations of velocity components and bed elevations in a horizontal plane just above gravel particle crests. The cross correlations suggest that upward and downward fluid motions are mainly associated with upstream-facing and lee sides of particles, respectively. Results also show that the relative submergence affects the turbulence intensity profiles for vertical velocity over the whole flow depth, while only a weak effect, limited to the near-bed region, is noticed for streamwise velocity component. The approximation of mean velocity profiles with a logarithmic formula reveals that log-profile parameters depend on relative submergence, highlighting inapplicability of a conventional "universal" logarithmic law for gravel-bed flows with intermediate submergence...|$|R

Given the considerable importance of ensuring that the right blend of people is employed in an organisation, the recruitment and selection of employees is of strategic importance to SMEs. Only a handful of research studies have ever been conducted on recruiting and selection practices in SMEs. By comparison, numerous studies have been conducted on recruiting practices in large well-established organisations. This study attempts to fill this gap, by examining and reporting the results of a national survey on the prevalence of recruitment and selection practices in SMEs (N = 1435). It further examines the impact of demographic factors such as organisational size, the presence of a HR manager and the existence of a strategic plan on recruitment and selection practices in Australian SMEs.

Recruitment practices were significantly more prevalent in medium-sized enterprises; where a HR manager was employed; and where a strategic plan existed.

For 13 eucalypt species there are conflicting results between different glasshouse and/or field trials. A <b>similar</b> <b>picture</b> <b>emerges</b> for Melaleuca, Acacia and Casuarina though in these genera fewer species have been tested in both glasshouse and field. Glasshouse trials have a role where specific information is needed from juvenile plants such as the ability of a species to exclude salt from the leaves, or performance under controlled conditions of waterlogging or saline waterlogging. However, as the objective of most experiments is to identify superior salt tolerant lines for the field, despite the complexity and cost, well designed and monitored field trials are the ultimate test. Researchers are also encouraged to consider inclusion of appropriate standard lines of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and E. occidentalis to enable better comparisons between trials...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays and aims to deepen our understanding of agent's actions in financial markets at different aggregation levels and using various data. In the first essay, we analyse the trades of brokers in a non-anonymous market. Specifically, we explore the information context of broker identities and how their disclosure can be exploited by other investors. Using data from the Helsinki Stock Exchange we form dynamic mean-variance strategies with daily rebalancing which condition on the net flow of brokers. We find that investors can benefit from knowing who trades compared to a portfolio that disregards this information. We demonstrate {{a link between the}} information content of broker order flow and the sophistication of their clients. In the second essay, we investigate the forecasts of sell-side analysts. We use banking sector news to proxy for the severity of career concerns and examine their impact on analysts' tendency to make bold forecasts. We show that analysts follow the consensus forecast more closely when the prospects of the banking sector are negative. The more established analysts, in terms of reputation and experience, are generally unaffected by banking news. In contrast, their less established peers cluster their forecasts near the consensus after negative news for banks. In the last essay, we are interested in the estimation of the covariation matrix of equity prices in the presence of market microstructure noise and non-synchronous trading. We base our analysis on a simple framework that derives separate pooled OLS regressions from other well-known estimators, whose byproducts are the integrated variance and covariance, and noise components. A comprehensive simulation study shows that our estimator is very precise and out-performs other widely applied estimation techniques. A <b>similar</b> <b>picture</b> <b>emerges</b> when we use historical data. Finally, we document the association of the noise component with liquidity frictions...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of modern {{society has been}} dominated by coal and oil, and together these two fossil fuels account for nearly two thirds of all primary energy used by mankind.   This makes future production a key question for future social development and this thesis attempts to answer whether it is possible to rely on an assumption of ever increasing production of coal and oil. Both coal and oil are finite resources, created over long time scales by geological processes. It is thus impossible to extract more fossil fuels than geologically available. In other words, there are limits to growth imposed by nature. The concept of depletion and exhaustion of recoverable resources is a fundamental question for the future extraction of coal and oil. Historical experience shows that peaking is a well established phenomenon in production of various natural resources. Coal and oil are no exceptions, and historical data shows that easily exploitable resources are exhausted while more challenging deposits are left for the future. For oil, depletion can also be tied directly to the physical laws governing fluid flows in reservoirs. Understanding and predicting behaviour of individual fields, in particularly giant fields, are essential for understanding future production. Based on comprehensive databases with reserve and production data for hundreds of oilfields, typical patterns were found. Alternatively, depletion can manifest itself indirectly through various mechanisms. This has been studied for coal. Over 60 % of the global crude oil production is derived from only around 330 giant oilfields, where many of them are becoming increasingly mature. The annual decline in existing oil production has been determined to be around 6 % and it is unrealistic that this will be offset by new field developments, additional discoveries or unconventional oil. This implies that the peak of the oil age is here. For coal a <b>similar</b> <b>picture</b> <b>emerges,</b> where 90 % of the global coal production originates from only 6 countries. Some of them, such as the USA show signs of increasing maturity and exhaustion of the recoverable amounts. However, there is a greater uncertainty about the recoverable reserves and coal production may yield a global maximum somewhere between 2030 and 2060. This analysis shows that the global production peaks of both oil and coal can be expected comparatively soon. This has significant consequences for the global energy supply and society, economy and environment. The results of this thesis indicate that these challenges should not be taken lightly...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{location}} of matter {{fields and the}} pattern of gauge symmetry in extra dimensions are crucial ingredients for string model building. We analyze realistic MSSM models from the heterotic Z 6 −II Mini–Landscape and extract those properties that are vital for their success. We find that Higgs bosons and the top-quark are not localized in extra dimensions {{and live in the}} full D = 10 dimensional space-time. The first two families of quarks and leptons, however, live at specific fixed points in extra dimensional space and exhibit a (discrete) family symmetry. Within a newly constructed Z 2 × Z 4 orbifold framework we further elaborate on these location properties and the appearance of discrete symmetries. A <b>similar</b> geometrical <b>picture</b> <b>emerges.</b> This particular Zip-code for quarks, leptons and Higgs bosons seems to be of more general validity and thus a useful guideline for realistic model building in string theory...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The {{medicines}} bill in {{high income}} countries accounts for approximately 17 % of total healthcare expenditure. However, around $ 500 million {{could be saved}} a year worldwide by optimising medicines use. This study aims to scope the evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions to address suboptimal use of medicines and pinpoint the evidence gaps to prioritise future research. Methods Systematic searches (up to February 2013) of the NHS Economic Evaluation Database, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects for systematic reviews on effectiveness or cost-effectiveness and for primary research on cost-effectiveness of interventions. Studies in English set in any country were included. Results Of the 646 records found, 108 studies met the inclusion criteria (29 cost-effectiveness studies (CES) and 81 systematic reviews on effectiveness (SRE)). The majority of CES addressed adherence (55 %), followed by inappropriate prescribing (31 %) and prescribing errors (28 %). No studies addressed the full medicines pathway. A <b>similar</b> <b>picture</b> <b>emerged</b> for SRE at 67 %, 15 and 11 respectively. Among the 15 types of outcomes used in CES, the top three were clinical (31 %) measures of adherence (21 %) and quality-adjusted life years (17 %). In SRE, hospitalisations (43 %), measures of adherence (23 %) and mortality (21 %) were the most frequent. Conclusions Interventions to improve suboptimal use of medicines tend to be specific to a particular aspect of the pathway and/or to a particular disease area. Little consideration is made {{on how to improve}} medicines use in patients with co-morbidities and poly-medication. The medicines pathway is rarely examined holistically but in a fragmented manner, making it difficult to draw conclusions on which aspect of suboptimal use of medicines should be prioritised for investment...|$|R
