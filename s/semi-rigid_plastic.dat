50|$|The {{construction}} method {{allows a}} person to join pieces by using medium pressure, locking the blocks together with <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> pins which, unlike other brands, avoids the friction and wear between the pins and the internal surfaces of the blocks. This system avoids the fragility and instability in the models, giving a solidity unequaled by any other construction toy or block system.|$|E
50|$|Most {{systems are}} usually {{constructed}} from 100 to 600 mm diameter, smooth-walled (so {{they do not}} easily trap condensation moisture and mold), rigid or <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>plastic,</b> plastic-coated metal pipes or plastic pipes coated with inner antimicrobial layers, buried 1.5 to 3 m underground where the ambient earth temperature is typically 10 to 23 C all year round in the temperate latitudes where most humans live. Ground temperature becomes more stable with depth. Smaller diameter tubes require more energy to move the air and have less earth contact surface area. Larger tubes permit a slower airflow, which also yields more efficient energy transfer and permits much higher volumes to be transferred, permitting more air exchanges in a shorter time period, when, for example, you want to clear the building of objectionable odors or smoke but suffer from poorer heat transfer from the pipe wall to the air due to increased distances.|$|E
40|$|The {{advanced}} {{analysis method}} used to analysis semi-rigid steel frames is introduced, and the method could {{take account of}} many factors influencing structure mechanical performance, these factors including initial imperfect of structure and members, geometrical nonlinearity (P-Δ,P-δeffects), material nonlinearity and semi-rigid connections. The Curved Stability Function Element (CSF element) is built to taking account of initial imperfect, <b>semi-rigid</b> connections and <b>plastic</b> hinge, and derivate the second-order element stiffness matrix and extend the spatial element stiffness matrix. The nonlinearity behavior of <b>semi-rigid</b> connections and <b>plastic</b> hinge are simulated by the spring element. Judgment criterion of plastic hinge and spring stiffness values are determined, and structure failure criterion is defined. The three semi-rigid steel frames are directly analyzed by the program NIDA, {{and the results of}} NIDA are comparatively analysis with test results. It is indicated that the results of NIDA are in accordance with test results better, verifying validity and reliability of the advanced analysis method used to analysis semi-rigid steel frames.

5000|$|Phacus {{consists}} of organisms that are microscopic photosynthetic Euglenoids, {{which are a}} group of single celled, chloroplast-containing autotrophs within the phylum Euglenozoa, though the majority of genera within the phylum actually do not contain chloroplasts and are colourless. Generally these species are small, free swimming and exhibit a vibrant green colour. What sets the genus apart from other photosynthetic species {{is the presence of}} its rigid cytoskeleton (although some species have <b>semi-rigid</b> or <b>plastic</b> cytoskeleton) made up of pellicular strips and its predominantly flat, leaf-shaped structure. Many different species express secondary fusion of these pellicular strips and many of the strips have a variety of shapes including S-shaped, A-shaped, M-shaped or plateau.|$|R
5000|$|Four {{injection}} molded <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> pieces {{constitute the}} circa 6 in tall figure which features printed accents on the dress and hand-painted details on hands, face and neck, hair, sunglasses, microphone and inserts in the trouser legs. Molded as one piece, {{the upper body}} of the figure including a static head is the most prominent part. The right arm with hand and microphone is also molded as one piece and attached to the upper body piece at the right shoulder by a snap-in joint with a square connector which keeps the right arm of the figure in a static position relative to the upper body piece. The lower body piece consists of the pelvic area and both legs molded as one piece. At the waist of the figure, {{the upper and lower}} body pieces are connected to each other by a flexible metal spring joint, as are the left arm piece and the upper body piece at the left shoulder. Both threaded connectors of the spring joint at the left shoulder of the figure are recessed, hiding the spring mechanism of the joint. The threaded connector of the lower body piece protrudes upward but the spring joint mechanism at the waist of the figure is concealed by a connector deeply recessed under the waist and belt portion of the jumpsuit which constitutes the bottom portion of the upper body piece.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{technique for}} transferring large area graphene grown by {{chemical vapor deposition}} on copper is presented. It is based on mechanical separation of the graphene/copper by H 2 bubbles during H 2 O electrolysis, which only takes a few tens of seconds while leaving the copper cathode intact. A <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> frame in combination with thin polymer layer span on graphene gives a convenient way of handling- and avoiding wrinkles and holes in graphene. Optical and electrical characterizations prove the graphene quality is better than that obtained by traditional wet etching transfer. This technique appears to be highly reproducible and cost efficient. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this research, three {{dimensional}} mathematical {{models were}} developed to predict the shelf life of tofu packaged in a <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> container. A model combining oxygen transfer through the package and oxygen consumption within the package was considered. According to the results, the model simulations estimated {{that the number of}} microorganisms in the filled water was higher than that in the tofu, suggesting the shelf life of packaged tofu was not affected by the number of microorganisms in the tofu product, but rather by the number of organisms in the filled water. Additionally, the effects of the physical properties of the packaging material, such as oxygen permeability through the package, oxygen diffusion coefficient, the initial oxygen concentration in the filled water, and the depth of the filled wate...|$|E
40|$|Catheters are <b>semi-rigid,</b> hollow <b>plastic</b> tubes {{that are}} {{indispensable}} {{when it comes}} to local surgery inside the heart,brain,arms, legs, or lungs. But how can a surgeon tell whether the catheter is going the right way? Most hospitals still use x-ray methods to check the catheters progress. To navigate the catheters passage in real time, some ten to twenty x-ray images are made every second. Even though the radiation dose involved is very low, no radiation at all would be much healthier both for the patient and the medical staff who run the risk of being exposed to the radiation on a daily basis. Researchers of the TU Delft faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science are currently developing a magnetic navigation system for medical instruments such as catheters and guide wires. A magnetic sensor on the tip of the medical instrument measures an external magnetic field and reports exactly where the tip of the instrument is located. In addition, the team is developing sensors that can measure a number of blood parameters simultaneously. Current systems allow the doctors to measure only a single parameter at a time so that a new catheter has to be inserted for each subsequent reading. A reduction in size of the sensors will bring this to an end. Delft University of Technolog...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteDaniel Y. C. FungThe {{process of}} canning or “commercial sterilization” {{has been studied}} {{for more than two}} centuries. The first to develop canning as a defense against {{spoilage}} was Nicholas Appert also known as the “father of canning. ” Appert invented a method of preservation by enclosing food in hermetically sealed containers and then heating containers to boiling temperatures for a specific period of time. The canning preservation method has changed over the years, and continues to change for the better. Technology for retorts, or processing vessels, has grown from the traditional steam heating medium to also include water and steam/water spray heating mediums. The once static vessels, now utilize rotation and shaking motions to decrease process time and in turn increase product quality. The product packaging has also evolved to include not only rigid metal containers, but <b>semi-rigid</b> and flexible <b>plastic</b> containers. The variety of packaging adds greater flexibility to the type of food products that can be produced in a shelf stable manner. Canning or “commercial sterilization” is still used today by the food industry as a method of providing safe food with extended shelf life. Today’s goal of commercial sterilization is to continue to produce safe food products that are high in quality and profitable to produce. A variety of processing equipment is available to accomplish those goals, ranging from a basic steam retort to the newest technology on the market known as Shaka. This new retort technology uses reciprocal agitation to shorten processing times and increase the quality of the final products. Studies have shown that the Shaka process reduces processing times better than 20 -fold compared to a still process and better than 10 -fold compared to a rotary process. As the field of thermal processing continues to evolve, the challenge will be to consistently produce safe, commercially sterile food that exceeds current quality expectations in a shorter process time while using less energy. Shaka, and other new technologies, will help the food industry meet these challenges and expectations by expanding the current capabilities of thermal processing to meet consumer demands...|$|R
40|$|A {{miniaturized}} radionuclide cardiac probe {{incorporated in}} a <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> chest garment has made ambulatory left ventricular (LV) function evaluation possible, with gated nuclear data being stored on tape together with electrocardiographic data, for subsequent off-line processing. After {{red blood cell}} labelling with 555 MBq (15 mCi) 99 mTc and standard gated blood pool imaging in 45 degrees LAO, we performed a continuous monitoring of LV function in 20 healthy male volunteers (age range: 22 - 25 years), in resting control conditions as well as during activities (standing, walking, climbing stairs) and after interventions (isosorbide dinitrate intake, Trendelenburg position, inflation of cuffs around the thighs). VEST-monitoring {{proved to be a}} reliable method that gave reproducible results: changes of ejection (EF) in basal conditions were lower than 5 % in 95 % of the patients. Changes in LV function caused by daily activities were easily demonstrated. While standing effected no significant EF changes, walking and climbing increased EF by 6. 9 % (p less than 0. 05) and 21. 2 % (p less than 0. 05) respectively. Changes in LV volumes caused by alterations in venous return were also demonstrated. Compared with baseline, Trendelenburg increased end-diastolic volume (EDV) by 2. 9 % while isosorbide dinitrate and inflation of cuffs decreased it by 5. 7 % and 2. 2 % respectively. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the effect of switching from an open (glass or <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>plastic)</b> infusion container to a closed, fully collapsible plastic infusion container (Viaflex®) on rate and time to onset of central lineassociated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). An open-label, prospective cohort, active healthcare-associated infection surveillance, sequential study was conducted in three intensive care units in Brazil. The CLABSI rate using open infusion containers was compared to the rate using a closed infusion container. Probability of acquiring CLABSI was assessed over time and compared between open and closed infusion container periods; three-day intervals were examined. A total of 1125 adult ICU patients were enrolled. CLABSI rate was significantly higher during the open compared with the closed infusion container period (6. 5 versus 3. 2 CLABSI/ 1000 CL days; RR= 0. 49, 95 %CI= 0. 26 - 0. 95, p= 0. 031). During the closed infusion container period, the probability of acquiring a CLABSI remained relatively constant along the time of central line use (0. 8 % Days 2 - 4 to 0. 7 % Days 11 - 13) but increased in the open infusion container period (1. 5 % Days 2 - 4 to 2. 3 % Days 11 - 13). Combined across all time intervals, the chance of a patient acquiring a CLABSI was significantly lower (55 %) in the closed infusion container period (Cox proportional hazard ratio 0. 45, p= 0. 019). CLABSIs can be reduced with the use of full barrier precautions, education, and performance feedback. Our results show that switching from an open to a closed infusion container may further reduce CLABSI rate as well as delay the onset of CLABSIs. Closed infusion containers significantly reduced CLABSI rate and the probability of acquiring CLABSI...|$|E
