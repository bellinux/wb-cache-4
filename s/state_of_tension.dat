5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914, World War I broke out in Europe, though the Ottomans {{initially}} remained neutral. On 3 August 1914, Barbaros Hayreddin began a refit at Constantinople—German engineers inspected her and other Ottoman warships in the dockyard and {{found them to be}} in a state of severe disrepair. Owing to the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>tension,</b> repairs could not be effected, and only ammunition, coal, and other supplies were loaded. By early November, the actions of the German battlecruiser Goeben, which had been transferred to the Ottoman Navy, resulted in declarations of war by Russia, France, and Great Britain. Between 1914–15, some of the ship's guns were removed and employed as coastal guns to shore up the defenses protecting the Dardanelles. In the meantime, she was used as a floating artillery battery at the Nara naval base, along with her sister Turgut Reis. Early during this stint, the ships were immobilized, but as the threat from British submarines grew, steam was kept up in their boilers to allow them to move quickly.|$|E

500|$|The song is {{a breakup}} lament {{dealing with the}} theme of commitment. Its title refers to the turning point of a {{relationship}}. The lyrics address a relationship in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> and uncertainty: [...] "We've reached the climax / We're together / Now we're undone / Won't commit so we choose to run away / Do we separate?" [...] Usher sings in a pleading falsetto and a plaintive tone on the song, alternating restrained vocals and anguished howls. In an interview for V-103, Usher stressed that [...] "Climax" [...] focuses more on the complication of relationships rather than sex, saying that [...] "it's really about the ultimate experience or lack thereof. Or the finale of an experience of love and life. When you're in a relationship and it has kinda reached the climax of where it can go, you gotta let it go {{if you are not}} going to commit." [...] He viewed that his falsetto vocals and the song's tone give the song a sexual feel with music that works as a [...] "double entendre".|$|E

40|$|The {{biological}} {{underpinnings of}} borderline personality disorder (BPD) and its psychopathology including <b>states</b> <b>of</b> aversive <b>tension</b> and dissociation is poorly understood. Our {{goal was to}} examine transcriptional changes associated with <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> or dissociation within individual patients in a pilot study. Dissociation {{is not only a}} critical symptom of BPD but has also been associated with higher risk for self-mutilation and depression. We conducted a whole blood gene expression profile analysis using quantitative PCR in 31 female inpatients with BPD. For each individual, two samples were drawn during a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> high <b>tension</b> and dissociation, while two samples were drawn at non-tension states. There was no association between gene expression and tension states. However, we could show that Interleukin- 6 was positively correlated to dissociation scores, whereas Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(s) subunit alpha isoforms, Mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 and 8, Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(i) subunit alpha- 2, Beta-arrestin- 1 and 2, and Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein were negatively correlated to dissociation. Our data point to a potential association of dissociation levels with the expression of genes involved in immune system regulation as well as cellular signalling/second-messenger systems.

2500|$|The vice-chancellor's bold speech incensed Hitler, and its {{publication}} was suppressed by the Propaganda Ministry. Angered by this reaction and stating {{that he had}} spoken on behalf of Hindenburg, Papen told Hitler that he was resigning and would inform Hindenburg at once. Papen told Hitler that unless the ban on the Marburg speech was lifted and Hitler declared himself willing to follow the line recommended by Papen in the Marburg speech, he would resign and would inform Hindenburg why he had resigned. Hitler knew that accepting the resignation of Hindenburg's long-time confidant, especially {{during a time of}} tumult, would anger the ailing president. He guessed right; not long afterward Hindenburg gave Hitler an ultimatum – unless he acted to end the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> in Germany, Hindenburg would throw him out of office and turn over control of the government to the army. Hitler outwitted Papen by telling him that he agreed with all of the [...] criticism of his regime made in the Marburg speech; told him Goebbels was wrong to ban the speech and he would have the ban lifted at once; and promised that the SA would be put in their place, provided Papen agreed not to resign and would meet with Hindenburg in a joint interview with him.

2500|$|Most emphatically in The Sickness Unto Death, Kierkegaard's author {{argues that}} the human self is a {{composition}} of various aspects that must be brought into conscious balance: the finite, the infinite, a consciousness of the [...] "relationship of the two to itself," [...] and a consciousness of [...] "the power that posited" [...] the self. The finite (limitations such as those imposed by one's body or one's concrete circumstances) and the infinite (those capacities that free us from limitations such as imagination) always exist in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>tension.</b> That tension between two aspects of the [...] "self" [...] that must be brought into balance. When the self is out of balance, i.e., has the wrong understanding of who it is because it conceives itself too much {{in terms of its}} own limiting circumstances (and thus fails to recognize its own freedom to determine what it will be) or too much in terms of what it would like to be, (thus ignoring its own circumstances), the person {{is in a state of}} despair. Notably, Anti-Climacus says one can be in despair even if one feels perfectly happy. Despair is not just an emotion, in a deeper sense it is the loss of self, i.e., it describes the state when one has the wrong conception of oneself.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to obtain the exact {{solution}} for the profile and characteristics of a two-dimensional sail, immersed in an inviscid incompressible fluid. An experimental investigation was also performed and results are compared with theoretical predictions. The sail {{was assumed to be}} an infinitely flexible, non-porous membrane of zero thickness, fixed at the leading and trailing edges, and stretched under a constant tension T in the sail surface. An aerofoil model was considered where the airflow remains smoothly attached over the entire profile. All known previous studies have also used the inviscid fluid approximation, but made the further assumptions of small angle of attack and negligible profile slopes. These assumptions enable the use of thin aerofoil theory predictions for pressure distribution and linearisation of the sail equation. In contrast this investigation obtains the exact solution. An iterative numerical method is devised whereby an initial estimate is made for the profile using thin aerofoil theory. The pressure distribution is then determined using Theodorsen's method and the profile recalculated using the full sail equation, so that tension and pressure forces are balanced. The cycle of redetermining the pressure distribution and profile is repeated until a convergent solution is obtained. Results are shown for the profile, lift coefficient and centre of pressure, for various angles <b>of</b> attack and <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>tension.</b> For sails with non-negligible camber, values of lift coefficient and centre of pressure are found to differ significantly from those predicted by the linear approximations. Previous researchers have established the existence <b>of</b> a critical <b>tension</b> <b>state</b> where the tension force is unable to contain the pressure forces acting on the sail, and predicted that the value <b>of</b> this <b>state</b> (KTc) was independent of angle of attack. However this study indicates that KTc increases with increasing angle of attack. Centre of pressure calculations, for various angles <b>of</b> attack and <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>tension,</b> indicate that two-dimensional sails may possess either static longitudinal stability or instability, depending on the tension state. Experimental results for the profile, KTc, lift coefficient and centre of pressure are compared with theory, and areas of agreement and disagreement discussed. Experimental values for the drag coefficient and the lift to drag ratio were obtained and are discussed in detail...|$|R
