50|$|The Brügger & Thomet MP9 (Machine Pistol 9mm) is {{a machine}} pistol {{designed}} and manufactured by Brügger & Thomet of Switzerland. The MP9 is a selective-fire 9×19mm Parabellum caliber machine pistol. It uses 15, 20, 25, and 30 round transparent polymer detachable box magazines.

40|$|Background: Interactive health {{information}} technology (HIT) can support the complex self-management tasks for diabetes. However, less {{is known about}} between-visit interactions and patient safety among chronic illness patients treated in the outpatient setting. Methods: We classified 13 categories for safety events and potential safety events within a larger trial evaluating a multilingual automated telephone self-management support system for diabetes using interactive voice response. Participants could trigger safety concerns by reporting hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, inability to obtain medications, medication nonadherence and side efects, and needing appointments and/or supplies. We then examined these triggers across patient demographic and health characteristics to determine which patients {{were most likely to}} experience safety events. Results: Overall, there were 360 safety triggers that occurred among 155 participants, which represented 53 % of individuals and 7. 6 % of all automated calls over the 27 -week intervention. The most common triggers were for pain or medication side effects (22 %) and not checking blood sugars (13 %). In adjusted models, race/ethnicity and language were related to safety triggers; Spanish-speaking participants were significantly (p =. 02) more likely than English-speaking participants to experience a <b>safety</b> <b>trigger,</b> and black participants were marginally more likely (p =. 09) than white participants to experience a <b>safety</b> <b>trigger.</b> Conclusion: About half of patients enrolled in a self-management technology intervention triggered at least one potential safety event {{over the course of the}} trial, and this was more frequent among some patients. Systems implementing HIT strategies to improve self-care and remote monitoring should consider specific program design elements to address these potential safety events. © Diabetes Technology Society...|$|E

40|$|Most {{re-entry}} vehicles utilize a Descent and Landing System (DLS) {{for a safe}} descent through the lowest part of the atmosphere. It usually requires deployment in a certain suitable range of flight conditions, which has to be estimated by limited means of navigation. This paper presents a comparison of currently used trigger methods and triggering algorithms {{which are based on}} correlation between in-flight measurements and the DLS triggering conditions, where the correlations have been extracted by multiple Monte Carlo campaigns. This approach gives a significant improvement of triggering accuracy over direct measurements for a ballistic re-entry. Also a lateral g-load <b>safety</b> <b>trigger</b> is developed to prevent the angle of attack oscillation escalation. Furthermore a sensor sensitivity analysis is performed for a lifting entry trajectory in order to support an upcoming ESA re-entry mission. The velocity drift appears to be the dominant dispersion by a factor ten for Mach estimation. Finally a case study has been performed to investigate the possibility to reduce the footprint by a dynamic parachute opening window. This could be effective for Mars reentry using a parachute able to deploy beyond Mach 2. 5, which would reduce the footprint by up to several tens of kilometers.

5000|$|The pistol has a {{multi-stage}} {{safety system}} {{consisting of two}} automatic internal <b>safeties,</b> two external <b>trigger</b> <b>safeties</b> and a manual lock safety. The first external <b>trigger</b> <b>safety</b> acts as the primary fail-safe. A small, spring-loaded inner trigger is housed in a wide, outer trigger and cannot be actuated unless the inset trigger is depressed first. This keeps the trigger from being pulled by an inadvertent off-angle trigger pull. This <b>trigger</b> <b>safety</b> also activates and when released—deactivates the two internal safeties: the firing pin and drop safety. The firing pin safety is contained in the pistol’s slide and blocks the longitudinal movement of the striker. The second <b>trigger</b> <b>safety</b> is an optional, manually operated plastic bar located inside the trigger guard and projecting out {{from the base of}} the pistol’s frame when activated, revealing a small white dot. This indicates that the pistol is currently incapable of being fired. It is used as an additional safety that disables the trigger with the firing pin spring cocked (after reloading the pistol). This safety is engaged by simultaneously pushing in two buttons on both sides of the frame and then deactivated by simply lifting the trigger finger and pushing the bar up and into the pistol's frame, thus allowing the trigger to be pulled back and the weapon fired. These safeties enable safe handling of the pistol with a round present in the chamber (the so-called [...] "cocked and locked" [...] condition) and allow for rapid deployment and immediate firing; this arrangement however does not permit the firing mechanism to be re-cocked in case of a misfire after the trigger has been pulled.|$|R
