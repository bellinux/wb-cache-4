40|$|The {{basic type}} of rock mass {{reinforcement}} method for both preparatory and operational workings in underground metal ore mines, both in Poland {{and in different}} countries across the world, is the expansion shell or adhesive-bonded rock bolt. The article discusses results of static loading test of the expansion <b>shell</b> rock <b>bolts</b> equipped with originally developed deformable component. This component consists of two profiled rock bolt washers, two disk springs, and three guide bars. The disk spring and disk washer material differs in stiffness. The construction materials ensure that at first the springs under loading are partially compressed, and then the rock bolt washer is plastically deformed. The rock bolts tested were installed in blocks simulating a rock mass with rock compressive strength of 80 MPa. The rock bolt was loaded statically until its ultimate loading capacity was exceeded. The study presents the results obtained under laboratory conditions in the test rig allowing testing of the rock bolts at their natural size, as used in underground metal ore mines. The stress-strain/displacement characteristics of the expansion <b>shell</b> rock <b>bolt</b> with the deformable component were determined experimentally. The relationships between the geometric parameters and specific strains or displacements of the bolt rod were described, and the percentage contribution of those values in total displacements, resulting from the deformation of rock bolt support components (washer, thread) and the expansion shell head displacements, were estimated. The stiffness of the yielded and stiff bolts was empirically determined, including stiffness parameters of every individual part (deformable component, steel rod).

Firstly, bolt looseness {{boundary of the}} shell {{is divided into two}} types, that is, different bolt looseness numbers and different bolt looseness levels, and natural frequencies and mode shapes are calculated by finite element method to roughly master vibration characteristics of TCS under these conditions. Then, the following measurements and identification techniques are used to get precise frequency, damping, and shape results; for example, noncontact laser Doppler vibrometer and vibration shaker with excitation level being precisely controlled are used in the test system; “preexperiment” is adopted to determine the required tightening torque and verify fixed constraint boundary; the small-segment FFT processing technique is employed to accurately measure nature frequency and laser rotating scanning technique is used to get shape results with high efficiency. Finally, based on the measured results obtained by the above techniques, the {{influence on}} modal parameters of TCS under two types of bolt looseness boundaries is analyzed and discussed.

The Maximum Pressure up To Which the Central Shells Could Be Tested Was 188. 5 psi. A Maximum Strain Of 5166 Micro Strains, At A Pressure Of 188. 5 psi, Was Found Near The GFRP Bulkhead In The Circumferential Direction. The Integrity Of The Bulkhead Joint Appears Satisfactory. The Nose-Cone, Tested For Internal Pressure Cycling Between 3 And L Lpsi Did Not Show Any Leaks Anywhere On The Surface Or From The Filler Cap. However, After 1104 Pressure Cycles,The End Flange Failed With A Loud Pop. On Inspection, It Was Found That The Failure Is Due To Improper Adhesion Between The GFRP Base Material And The Aluminum Ring Holding The End-Flange.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{transient}} behavior of structures with bolted joints subjected to impact or shock loads using experimental methods and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Various factors that affect the response of the bolted joint structures for shock loading were studied, such as damping, preload, intensity of impact load and type of FE modeling. The objective of this work was to develop computational modeling procedures that provide structural analysts an improved physics-based shock model for combat vehicles focusing mainly on shock transmission across bolted joints. There is only a limited amount of published literature describing the proper method for analyzing the transient shock propagation across bolted connections for high impact loading. The initial case study focused on a simple cantilever beam with bolted lap joint subjected to relatively low levels of impact force. The second case study used a flat plate bolted to a hat-section and the third structure evaluated was two hat sections bolted together. These simple configurations are representative of structures found in many military ground vehicles that can be subjected to transient impact and blast loads. These structures were subjected to low impact loading (non destructive) using impact hammers and high impact loading (destructive) using an air gun and their responses were measured using accelerometers. LS-DYNA FE solver was used to simulate the shock propagation in bolted structures. For all the bolted structures, the modal analysis was performed both experimentally and numerically. The results were in excellent agreement for lower modes and small deviation in higher modes. Secondly, the time history response of experimental and FE analysis are compared. Normalized Root Mean Square Deviation (NRMSD) criterion was used to compare the experimental and FE result. A full detailed FE model and a simplified FE model of the bolted structures were developed for impact analysis and their prediction were compared with the experimental results. In all the cases, the detailed FE model with 3 -D solid elements showed good agreement with the experimental results. The simplified FE model with <b>shell</b> elements (<b>bolts</b> were not modeled) predicted higher magnitudes in the acceleration values. Addition of damping in the simplified FE model reduced the higher magnitudes in the predicted response and the results were in good agreement with the experiment. The simplified FE model developed for bolted joint structure in this report reduced the CPU time by one order (30 hours to 3. 5 hours) and can be practically implemented in the full vehicle FE model for crash or blast analysis...|$|R
