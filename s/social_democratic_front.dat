5|$|President Biya's Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) was {{the only}} legal {{political}} party until December 1990. Numerous regional political groups have since formed. The primary opposition is the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (SDF), based largely in the Anglophone {{region of the country}} and headed by John Fru Ndi.|$|E
25|$|Takembeng or Takumbeng are {{a female}} social {{movement}} in the Northwest Region of Cameroon. These movements connect with traditional practices common throughout the Western grassfields of Cameroon where groups of women perform ostracizing rituals against individuals in their communities. Toward the end of colonial control {{and in the early}} years of independent Cameroon (the 1950s and 1960s), these local practices became a crucial tool for larger political protest, often against agricultural policy. With political liberalization in the 1990s, the Takembeng women became a crucial part of opposition to the ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) party. The women marched with the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (SDF) and would use nudity and the social status of older women to prevent troops and security forces from harassing protesters.|$|E
25|$|Takembeng mobilizations are {{the latest}} in a long history of female mobilizations in the Western grassfields of Cameroon. Sociologist Susan Diduk divides these mobilizations into three {{different}} periods (with prior forms continuing to exist in later periods). The first period of women exercising moral guardianship involved women in rural communities mobilizing to shame individuals who violated key community moral standards. A second period involved women from multiple communities connecting with one another to protest colonial and post-independence policies, primarily agricultural, from the 1950s on. Takembeng is the name for mobilizations which begun in the early 1990s and often took place with the opposition party to the government, the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (SDF). Some sources claim that Takembeng is a long-standing practice in Ngemba communities and that it does not grow from the practices in the various communities.|$|E

50|$|In March 1991, {{alongside}} Rafael Barbosa, Ialá {{helped found}} the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Front</b> (FDS). On 14 January 1992, Ialá left the FDS and formed the Social Renewal Party (PRS).|$|R
50|$|The PU was {{established}} in 2003 as an alliance of the Democratic Convergence Party, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front,</b> the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Front,</b> FLING and the Solidarity and Work Party, and was led by Hélder Vaz Lopes, a former leader of the Resistance of Guinea-Bissau-Bafatá Movement. A co-founder was his cousin Zinha Vaz.|$|R
25|$|The Takembeng women {{provide a}} unique {{political}} {{organization in the}} restrictive political environment of Cameroon. In order to avoid being stopped by security forces as they walk from rural areas to urban centers they wear better clothing on the trip. However, when they march, the state responds with less violent measures than they do with other protesters (although at times, Takembeng women are also placed under house arrest, beaten, and killed by the government). As {{a result of this}} greater tolerance, Takembeng women provide some key support to the opposition party, the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (SDF). In 1998, Takembeng women provided a protective caravan for John Fru Ndi, SDF Chairman, to leave the country and make a political trip to France and the United States. Although they are related closely with the SDF, the members of the Takembeng are clear in interviews that they are not a branch or tool of the party; instead, they support the ideals of the party {{and as long as the}} SDF holds to those values, their protests will overlap. During the disorder of the early 1990s, Takembeng women were recorded disrupting troops from elsewhere in Cameroon by stripping in front of them.|$|E
2500|$|Takembeng protests {{developed}} in the early 1990s, located primarily {{in the city of}} Bamenda. With political liberalization, including the first multi-party elections in 1992 and the legalization of opposition parties (including the important <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> in the Northwest Province), Takembeng protests began to play a part of the wider political struggle. [...] The movement became highly important following the 1992 elections and the disorder that followed in the Northwest Province, where much of the population believed the results were fraudulent and protests became widespread.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} tactics, the Takembeng women use their {{numbers and the}} social status accorded to older women {{in order to protect}} other protesters. In certain instances, the women use nudity and urinating and defecating in public as key aspects of their protest. Showing their vaginas or {{threatening}} to do so provide a unique power for the women and these tactics are quite effective in preventing troops or security forces from intervening in the protests. Historian Henry Kam Kah explains that [...] "The symbolisation in this threat of the vagina shows the central role of women in matters of procreation. Reverence for the vagina is reverence for the woman and her creator. A woman can lose all else but not her vagina which is representative of her entire womanhood. Women do not expose them carelessly and when this happens or threats are made to this effect, men take to their heels for they cannot abuse the part of the body that brought them to mother earth. In fact, in contemporary Cameroon, the Takembeng women of Mankon, Bamenda, used the vagina as a weapon to lend support to the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Front</b> (SDF) party and dispel the gun trotting [...] military men." [...] Similarly, Susan Diduk explains that “it is less that female nakedness affronts onlookers, and more that displaying female genitalia is a powerful act of moral censure embodying widely shared assumptions about mystical power and pollution.” These more direct forms of activism are not undertaken without great care being taken. Younger women are not included in these practices and are kept a good distance away from these demonstrations and soldiers and security forces are warned before they occur.|$|E

2500|$|Even other {{political}} parties ran with the story. [...] A party election broadcast for the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party, <b>fronted</b> by John Cleese, named Islington council as [...] "the council that accused a five year old of reciting a racially offensive poem". [...] Islington council sought an injunction in the High Court {{to have this}} material excluded, but this was denied by Mr Justice Drake. David Owen dropped the material anyway, stating that it was to avoid further distress to the five-year-old's family. [...] Ironically, the press reported Owen's press conference, announcing this change, as [...] "loony" [...] David Owen [...] "outclowning anything that Basil Fawlty could have thought up".|$|R
