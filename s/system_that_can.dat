5|$|A vector {{processor}} is a CPU or computer <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> execute the same instruction on large sets of data. Vector processors have high-level operations that work on linear arrays of numbers or vectors. An example vector operation is A = B × C, where A, B, and C are each 64-element vectors of 64-bit floating-point numbers. They {{are closely related}} to Flynn's SIMD classification.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{derivative}} of FreeBSD, DragonFly has inherited an easy-to-use integrated build <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> rebuild the entire base system from source {{with only a}} few commands. The DragonFly developers use the Git version control system to manage changes to the DragonFly source code. Unlike its parent FreeBSD, DragonFly has both stable and unstable releases in a single source tree, due to a smaller developer base.|$|E

40|$|A popular {{view of what}} Artificial Intelligence can do {{for lawyers}} is <b>that</b> it <b>can</b> {{do no more than}} deduce the {{consequences}} from a precisely stated set of facts and legal rules. This immediately makes many lawyers sceptical about the usefulness of such systems: this mechanical approach seems to leave out most of what is important in legal reasoning. We will review <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> store conflicting interpretations and <b>that</b> <b>can</b> propose alternative solutions to a case based on these interpretations. We will also describe <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> use legal precedents to generate arguments by drawing analogies to or distinguishing precedents. We will discuss <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> argue why a rule should not be applied to a case even though all its conditions are met. Then there are <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> act as a mediator between disputing parties by structuring and recording their arguments and responses. Finally we look at <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> suggest mechanisms and tactics for forming arguments. ...|$|R
5|$|Octopuses {{are highly}} intelligent, but {{the extent of}} their {{intelligence}} and learning capability are not well defined. Maze and problem-solving experiments have shown evidence of a memory <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> store both short- and long-term memory. It is not known precisely what contribution learning makes to adult octopus behaviour. Young octopuses learn nothing from their parents, as adults provide no parental care beyond tending to their eggs until the young octopuses hatch.|$|E
5|$|The school {{operates}} the F.G. Walton Smith research vessel. Designed to met the school's specifications, the catamaran {{was put on}} water in 2000. It {{is equipped with a}} special sea water flow <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> take samples. The on-board lab can perform chemical analysis of those water samples. It also has transducers for measuring ocean currents, sub-bottom profiling, and deep water bathymetry. In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the vessel was reassigned to environmental monitoring of affected areas and to track underwater plumes of oil.|$|E
5|$|Inside, {{the main}} room is a conference room {{on the main floor}} that {{includes}} a large projection <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be used for remote feeds, such as from the state capitol across the street. A painting by John Fery is displayed over the fireplace, which the fireplace was part of the original structure in the conference room. The remainder of the interior of the building has a modern look with glass-enclosed offices surrounding an open common area. Artwork owned by the university's Hallie Ford Museum of Art is displayed in this area. The main floor of the three-story building is the second floor, which rests atop the look-out basement. A small meeting room is located above {{a small portion of the}} main floor.|$|E

5|$|With {{the added}} missile {{capacity}} of the battleships in the 1980s came additional fire-support systems to launch and guide the ordnance. To fire the Harpoon anti-ship missiles, the battleships were equipped with the SWG-1 fire-control system, and to fire the Tomahawk missiles the battleships used either the SWG-2 or SWG-3 fire-control system. In addition to these offensive-weapon systems, the battleships were outfitted with the AN/SLQ-25 Nixie {{to be used as}} a lure against enemy torpedoes, an SLQ-32 electronic warfare <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> detect, jam, and deceive an opponent's radar and a Mark 36 SRBOC system to fire chaff rockets intended to confuse enemy missiles.|$|E
5|$|As players hit various objects {{around the}} field, their score goes up. At certain scores, players gain a new ball. If the ball {{falls to the}} bottom, that round is over, and the players' scores are tallied, given bonuses for their achievements. In order to prevent players from losing a ball, the game {{features}} a Ball Saver, which allows the ball to fall without being lost. This eventually goes away, however. The game has a shop <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> provide boosts for players, such one that adds a Ball Saver. Coins are collected through various means, and are used to purchase items from this shop. If all balls are lost, the game is over. The other objective {{of the game is}} to complete the Pokédex, similar to other Pokémon titles. Occasionally, a hole will open in the field, where players can either gain bonuses, such as an added Ball Saver or a score increase, or allow them to go to a special mode. There are four primary modes - Catch 'Em Mode, Egg Mode, Evolution Mode, and Travel Mode. These modes are typically activated by going through a certain path on the board three times, and then entering an area on the board, such as the Sharpedo, which will activate Catch 'Em Mode.|$|E
5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be used to contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system {{can also be used to}} call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E
