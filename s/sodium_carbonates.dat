40|$|Infrared (IR) spectra {{were used}} to study the fly ash {{both before and after}} having been treated by using <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> at 860 degrees C for 1. 5 h. The IR results show that fly ash is {{composed}} of mullite and silica, which change into nepheline after being heated with <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate.</b> According to these IR curves, different <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> amount makes the products different. For example, as fly ash: <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> > 1. 2 : 1, the product is mainly nepheline with some mullite left. However, when increasing the use of <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> to the range of fly ash: <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> < 1. 2 : 1, the mullite phase disappears, while some <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> remains; and the structure of nepheline has little change.

50|$|Crystalline {{technology}} {{is used to}} create hydrophobic concrete by causing crystal structures to form in the tiny capillaries, pores and other air pockets {{left behind in the}} concrete curing process. During this formation, by-products are left behind in the capillaries and pores of the freshly cured concrete, typically calcium hydroxide, sulfates, <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> potassium, calcium, and hydrated and unhydrated cement particles. These crystal structures then plug the pores and capillaries, preventing water from flowing through them. Once the crystalline chemicals are added to the concrete mixture, through either an admixture or coating, they react with the by-products in the presence of water. This reaction then forms an insoluble crystal structure that clogs the pores. This process continues until all the chemicals have reacted. When applied as a coating, the chemical reaction proceeds through the process of chemical diffusion. This is a process of a high chemical density solution migrating towards the low density chemical solution until the two come into equilibrium. Soaking the concrete in water creates a low chemical density in the pores, and applying the crystalline chemical as a coating then creates a high chemical density. These two fluids diffuse through the inner structure of the concrete until they reach equilibrium throughout the inner structure. When this process is finished, the hydrophobic concrete's crystal structure is complete.|$|E

The powder mixture is placed in a nonwoven polyethylene sachet separated from the food by a pad. In the presence of moisture, <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> peroxyhydrate first decomposes into <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> and hydrogen peroxide which decomposes into water and oxygen. <b>Sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> reacts with carbon dioxide to form sodium bicarbonate. Because the sachet is not placed in direct contact with the food or food exudates, only hydrogen peroxide which decomposes to water and oxygen may be released with no other potential migration of volatile compounds. Based on the conclusion drawn in the EU Risk Assessment Report that hydrogen peroxide is not classified as a mutagen and the results from a subchronic toxicity study with hydrogen peroxide, the Panel concluded that hydrogen peroxide does not raise a safety concern under the intended conditions of use.
