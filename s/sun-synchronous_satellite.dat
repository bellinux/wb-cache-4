Overall, the best sampling capability and lowest errors were obtained with a three-satellite system, i. e., two sun-synchronous satellites with different equatorial crossing times combined with either a 46 or 57 -deg orbit satellite.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the design and station keeping of repeat-groundtrack orbits for <b>Sun-synchronous</b> <b>satellite.</b> A method to compute the semimajor axis of the orbit is {{presented}} together with a station-keeping strategy to compensate for the perturbation due to the atmospheric drag. The results show that the nodal period converges gradually with the increase of the order used in the zonal perturbations up to J 15. A differential correction algorithm is performed to obtain the nominal semimajor axis of the reference orbit from the inputs of the desired nodal period, eccentricity, inclination and argument of perigee. To keep the satellite in the proximity of the repeat-groundtrack condition, a practical orbit maintenance strategy is proposed in the presence of errors in the orbital measurements and control, {{as well as in the}} estimation of the semimajor axis decay rate.

40|$|This work {{describes}} some of {{the most}} extensive ground-based observations of the aerosol profile collected in Southeast Asia to date, highlighting the challenges in simulating these observations with a mesoscale perspective. An 84 -h WRF Model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) mesoscale simulation of smoke particle transport at Kuching, Malaysia, in the southern Maritime Continent of Southeast Asia is evaluated relative to a unique collection of continuous ground-based lidar, sun photometer, and 4 -h radiosonde profiling. The period was marked by relatively dry conditions, allowing smoke layers transported to the site unperturbed by wet deposition to be common regionally. The model depiction is reasonable overall. Core thermodynamics, including landsea-breeze structure, are well resolved. Total model smoke extinction and, by proxy, mass concentration are low relative to observation. Smoke emissions source products are likely low because of undersampling of fires in infrared <b>sun-synchronous</b> <b>satellite</b> products, which is exacerbated regionally by endemic low-level cloud cover. Differences are identified between the model mass profile and the lidar profile, particularly during periods of afternoon convective mixing. A static smoke mass injection height parameterized for this study potentially influences this result. The model does not resolve the convective mixing of aerosol particles into the lower free troposphere or the enhancement of near-surface extinction from nighttime cooling and hygroscopic effects...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{data from}} a <b>sun-synchronous</b> <b>satellite</b> were used to {{investigate}} how large-scale estuarine suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations were affected by tidal and bulk meteorological drivers, and how retrieved SPM is biased by tidal aliasing and sampling under clear sky conditions. Local absorption and scattering properties were used to derive surface SPM maps from 84 cloud-free ENVISAT MERIS FR reflectance images of the Westerschelde estuary (51 ° 30 ' N, 3 ° 30 ' E) for the period 2006 – 2008, and validated with in situ SPM at fixed stations (r = 0. 89 for geometric means). The distinctly different SPM maps were categorized for different tidal and seasonal conditions. Resulting composites reveal spatial patterns in SPM {{as a function of}} semi-diurnal tidal phase, fortnightly tidal phase, or season. For the estuary proper, tidal and seasonal effects on the variation of SPM are similar in magnitude. Observed controls for surface SPM are distance to shallow source area, tidal current velocity, and advection of North Sea and estuarine surface waters. Turbidity maxima appear only during favourable tidal and meteorological conditions. For the Westerschelde, the bias introduced by sun-synchronous sampling causes low water image acquisitions to uniquely coincide with spring tides, and high water images with neap tides. Cloud-free images were associated with low wind velocities. Simulations from a mud transport model confirmed the overestimation of geometric mean SPM from the tidal aliasing, and underestimation from fair weather. This resulted in a net relative error of - 8 % at the wave-exposed mouth, but biases cancelled out in the upper estuary. We argue that local biases should be considered when interpreting water quality products for estuaries and coasts around the world...|$|E

The observations serve studies about small-scale variations of water vapour {{as well as the}} detection of local and global trends. However, depending on the swath width of the sensor, the temporal sampling is low and the observations of TCWV are limited to cloud-free land scenes. This study quantifies the representativeness of a single TCWV observation {{at the time of the}} satellite overpass under cloud-free conditions by investigating the diurnal cycle of TCWV using 9  years of a 2 -hourly TCWV data set from global GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) stations. It turns out that the TCWV observed at 10 : 30  local time (LT) is generally lower than the daily mean TCWV by 0. 65  mm (4  %) on average for cloud-free cases. Averaging over all GNSS stations, the monthly mean TCWV at 10 : 30  LT, constrained to cases that are cloud-free, is 5  mm (25  %) lower than the monthly mean TCWV at 10 : 30  LT of all cases. Additionally, the diurnal variability of TCWV is assessed. For the majority of GNSS stations, the amplitude of the averaged diurnal cycle ranges between 1 and 5  % of the daily mean with a minimum between 06 : 00 and 10 : 00  LT and maximum between 16 : 00 and 20 : 00  LT.

40|$|Radiation Budget Instrument (RBI) {{will be one}} of five {{instruments}} flying {{aboard the}} JPSS- 2 spacecraft, a polar-orbiting <b>sun-synchronous</b> <b>satellite</b> in Low Earth Orbit. RBI is a passive remote sensing instrument that will follow the successful legacy of the Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments to make a long term measurement of Earth’s radiation budget. The goal of RBI is to provide an independent measurement of the broadband reflected solar radiance and Earth’s emitted thermal radiance by using three spectral bands (Shortwave, Longwave, and Total) that will have the same overlapped point spread function (PSF) footprint on Earth. To ensure precise NIST-traceable calibration in space the RBI sensor is designed to use a visible calibration target (VCT), a solar calibration target (SCT), and an infrared calibration target (ICT) containing phase change cells (PCC) to enable temperature calibration. The VCT is a thermally controlled integrating sphere with space grade Spectralon covering the inner surface. The two sides of the sphere will have fiber-coupled laser diodes in the UV to IR wavelength region. An electrical substitution radiometer on the integrating sphere will monitor the long term stability of the sources and the possible degradation of the Spectralon in space. In addition the radiometric calibration operations will use the Spectralon diffusers of the SCT to provide accurate measurements of solar degradation. All those stable on-orbit references will ensure that calibration stability is maintained over the RBI sensor lifetime. For the preflight calibration the RBI will view five calibration sources – two integrating spheres and three CrIS –like blackbodies whose outputs will be validated with NIST calibration approach. Thermophile detectors are the primary choice for the RBI. The sensor has a requirement to perform lunar calibration in addition to solar calibration in space in a way similar to CERES instruments approach. To monitor climate change and to get meaningful results is critical to assure stable calibration over instrument lifetime...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} diurnal {{and seasonal}} variations of snow albedo at four Baseline Surface Radiation Network {{stations in the}} Arctic and Antarctica from 2003 to 2008 to elucidate similarities and differences in snow albedo diurnal cycles across geographic zones and to assess how diurnal changes in snow albedo affect the surface energy budget. At the seasonal scale, the daily albedo for the perennial snow at stations South Pole and Georg von Neumayer in Antarctica has a similar symmetric variation with solar zenith angle (SZA) around the austral summer; whereas the daily albedo for the seasonal snow at stations Barrow, Alaska, and Ny-Ålesund, Spitsbergen, in the Arctic tends to decrease with SZA decrease from winter to spring before snow starts melting. At the hourly scale, each station shows unique diurnal cycles due to different processes that affect snow albedo such as cloud cover, snow metamorphism, surface hoar formation, SZA, solar azimuth angle, and surface features. Cloud escalates the snow albedo at all four stations by shifting solar radiation to visible wavelengths and diminishes the diurnal variation by diffusing incident solar radiation. The 24 h mean snow albedo is higher on cloudy than clear days by 0. 02 at the South Pole (December) and Barrow (May), 0. 05 at Neumayer (December), and 0. 07 at Ny-Ålesund (April). Snow surface structures, for example, wind-channeled sastrugi, {{appear to be a}} controlling factor in the diurnal variation of clear-sky snow albedo at the South Pole and Ny-Ålesund. The surface hoar formation cycles and snow metamorphism are consistent with the asymmetric diurnal variation of snow albedo at Neumayer and Barrow. Near the melting point temperature, melt-freeze cycles exceed cloud and surface structure impacts and dominate the diurnal variation of snow albedo at stations Barrow and Ny-Ålesund. The satellite-measured clear-sky snow albedo usually underestimates the average all-sky snow albedo at these stations. These results illustrate the potential biases in daily and monthly albedo products constructed from <b>sun-synchronous</b> <b>satellite</b> daily instantaneous observations which inevitably undersample the diurnal variation of snow albedo...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare the erythemal UV irradiance (UVER) and spectral UV irradiances (at 305, 310 and 324 nm) from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard NASA EOS/Aura polar <b>sun-synchronous</b> <b>satellite</b> (launched in July 2004, local equator crossing time 01 : 45 p. m.) with ground-based measurements from the Brewer spectroradiometer # 150 located at El Arenosillo (South of Spain). The analyzed period comprises more than four years, from October 2004 to December 2008. The effects of several factors (clouds, aerosols, ozone and the solar elevation) on OMI-Brewer comparisons were analyzed. The proxies used for each factor were: OMI Lambertian Equivalent Reflectivity (LER) at 360 nm (clouds), the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 440 nm measured from the ground-based Cimel sun-photometer ([URL] OMI total column ozone, and solar elevation at OMI overpass time. The comparison for all sky conditions reveals positive biases (OMI higher than Brewer) 12. 3 % for UVER, 14. 2 % for UV irradiance at 305 nm, 10. 6 % for 310 nm and 8. 7 % for 324 nm. The OMI-Brewer Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is reduced when cloudy cases are removed from the analysis, (e. g., RMSE ~ 20 % for all sky conditions and RMSE smaller than 10 % for cloud-free conditions). However, the biases remain and even become more significant for the cloud-free cases with respect to all sky conditions. The mentioned overestimation is clearly documented as due to aerosol extinction influence. The differences OMI-Brewer typically decrease with increasing the Solar Zenith Angle (SZA). The seasonal dependence of the OMI-Brewer difference for cloud-free conditions is driven by aerosol climatology. To account for the aerosol effect, a first evaluation in order to compare with previous TOMS results (Anton et al., 2007) was performed. This comparison shows that the OMI bias is between + 14 % and + 19 % for UVER and spectral UV irradiances for moderately-high aerosol load (AOD&gt; 0. 25). The OMI bias is decreased by a factor of 2 (the typical bias varies from + 8 % to + 12 %) under cloud-free and low aerosol load conditions (AOD&lt; 0. 1). More detailed analysis of absorbing aerosols influence on OMI bias at our station is presented in a companion paper (Cachorro et al., 2010) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the range of}} coverage options available to TopSat like small satellites, both singly and in a small constellation. TopSat is a low-cost, high resolution and image quality, optical small satellite, due for launch in October 2004. In particular, the paper considers the use of tuned, repeat ground track orbits to improve coverage for selected ground targets, {{at the expense of}} global coverage. TopSat is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of small satellites for high value remote sensing missions. It is a 108 kg, <b>sun-synchronous</b> <b>satellite,</b> designed to provide 2. 5 m resolution imagery direct to users {{in the vicinity of the}} imaged area. Its objectives are to demonstrate the capability to cost performance available from small satellites, the utility of direct reception of remotely sensed imagery, and the affordability of constellations and individually owned assets. A description of the satellite, and update on the development and flight build of the satellite is given, as of June 2003. Two coverage improving augmentations to the TopSat satellite are discussed, namely the addition of a propulsion system and more capable attitude actuators. With limited orbit control, achievement and maintenance of tuned orbits, and phasing of a constellation within orbits, become practicable. TopSat is an agile small satellite, allowing boresight reorientation required for slews during imaging. The capability for performing multiple images in a single target pass is considered, with the existing and improved torque actuator implementations. Similar options for performing stereo imaging with 2 formation flying TopSats are outlined. Reconfiguration of repeat ground track orbits for a single satellite is analysed in terms of fuel cost and drift orbit options. A one day repeat orbit case is presented which would allow daily coverage of a fixed target, with orbit reconfiguration required to allow global access. A typical mission for such a satellite is summarised, along with practical requirements for the propulsion system. Coverage options for constellations of between 2 and 4 satellites are then also scrutinised, with fuel estimates for the most promising options explored. Again, the benefits that could be achieved by using repeat ground track orbits are weighed against the fuel requirements, to maintain and reconfigure such a constellation. The TopSat mission is a collaboration between four UK partners. QinetiQ are leading the mission and providing data handling and ground segment elements. Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) are developing the camera, Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) are providing the bus, and InfoTerra are responsible for developing potential data markets.
