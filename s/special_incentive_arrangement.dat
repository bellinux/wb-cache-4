40|$|This paper assesses G. A. Cohen’s {{critique}} of Rawlsian <b>special</b> <b>incentives.</b> Two arguments are identified and criticized: {{an argument that}} the difference principle does not justify incentives because of a limitation on an agent’s prerogative to depart from a direct promotion {{of the interests of}} the worst off, and an argument that justice is limited in its scope. The first argument is evaluated and defended from the criticism that once Cohen has conceded some ethically grounded <b>special</b> <b>incentives</b> he cannot sustain his {{critique of}} <b>special</b> <b>incentives.</b> But it is finally re-jected as a subtle form of an unreasonably demanding moral rigorism. The second argument is interpreted as the more plausible of Cohen’s claims. It has, however, to be defended via two subsidiary theses: the claim that Rawls endorses a moral division of labour and that this in turn grounds a further commitment to moral dualism as opposed to moral monism. This argument is assessed and rejected. Neither the moral division of labour nor moral monism supports the claim that in applying the principles of justice to a basic structure one does not thereby apply them to the individuals constrained to act within that structure in the marketing o...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{review the}} {{theoretical}} {{literature on the}} determinants of international workers'remittances and then posit an empirical model that accounts for demographic, portfolio, and macroeconomic factors that - together with <b>special</b> <b>incentive</b> policies - determine official remittances. They estimated the model using data from five major labor-exporting countries of North Africa and Europe: Morocco, Portugal, Tunisia, Turkey, and the former Yugoslavia. The econometric results strongly corroborate the model's predictions and reveal interesting policy implications. In planning for the future growth of remittances, labor-exporting countries should explicitly {{take into consideration the}} history of migration, since an aging labor force abroad will be less inclined to remit. Labor-exporting countries should also account for the economic prospects of the major labor-receiving countries and for the geographical distribution of their migrant labor. The authors'results show that remittances are significantly affected by economic policies in the home (labor-exporting) countries. <b>Special</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes cannot substitute for a stable, credible macroeconomic policy.

50|$|A public body’s {{experience}} with an incentive program can impact its approach toward <b>incentive</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The prior {{experience with}} an insolvent company {{enrolled in a}} program can prompt a public body to adopt rigorous prequalification criteria {{as part of its}} incentive screening process. Likewise, the failure of a recipient to meet public body’s expectations about a project (e.g., employment) can prompt it to impose strict project commitments on new incentive recipients. Conversely, an incentive program with a successful track record of business expansion or retention can encourage the expansion of the program or the adoption of new incentive programs.|$|R

40|$|Objectives Shifting {{the focus}} of health-care systems towards {{prevention}} has proved difficult to achieve. Governance structures are complex, incentives may conflict {{and there are many}} competing priorities. We explored the influence of governance and <b>incentive</b> <b>arrangements</b> on commissioning for health and well-being in the English National Health Service (NHS) and the governance paradoxes which emerge. Methods Qualitative and quantitative methods were employed. We carried out one national and two regional focus groups; a national online survey of primary care trusts (PCTs); and 99 semi-structured interviews in 10 purposively selected case study sites across England. Interviewees included decision-makers in PCTs, practice-based commissioners, Chairs of Local Involvement Networks (LINks) and of Overview and Scrutiny committees (OSCs) and Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS) members of local health and wellbeing partnerships. Results Case study sites differed in {{the extent to which they}} reflected a public health ethos throughout the commissioning cycle, incentivized preventive services through contractual flexibilities or prioritized investment in health and wellbeing. Practice-based commissioners were tangentially involved in the commissioning cycle, public health partnerships or local health needs assessment. While commissioning for health and wellbeing involves working through partnerships, performance management regimes favoured single organizational success. Preventive services were considered at increased risk in times of financial stringency. Conclusions As the NHS in England undergoes further reorganization, it is important to ensure that a systematic, strategic and population-based approach to commissioning is not lost. Governance and <b>incentive</b> <b>arrangements</b> should be critically assessed for their impact on population health and wellbeing. ...|$|R
