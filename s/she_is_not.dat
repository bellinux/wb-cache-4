5|$|While Lexie can be sympathetic, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> empathetic, {{and tends}} to lash out and react childishly at {{perceived}} slights, or when faced with behavior she does not like or understand.|$|E
50|$|The American {{journalist}} and author Vincent Sheean added: <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> chic, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> charming, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> intelligent. Reynaud <b>was</b> used to her, depended on her, needed her: that was all.|$|R
60|$|Yet to {{the casual}} eye <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> discontented, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> an {{abnormal}} and distressing traitor {{to the faith}} of Main Street.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> at work; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> pausing over it. Her head {{hung down}} over her breast; her hands and arms lay {{helpless}} on the desk.|$|R
5|$|Among the world's {{remaining}} battleships, Texas {{is notable}} {{for being the}} only remaining World War I–era dreadnought battleship, though <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the oldest surviving battleship: , a pre-dreadnought battleship ordered in 1898 by the Imperial Japanese Navy and HMS Victory, Nelson's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar, are both older than Texas. She is also noteworthy for being one of only seven remaining ships and the only remaining capital ship to have served in both World Wars.|$|E

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{quite what}} you would call refined. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> quite {{what you would}} call unrefined. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{the kind of person that}} keeps a parrot. [...] --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.|$|R
60|$|Philippa's wrongs had goaded her to madness. Her madness was {{responsible}} for the act. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> mad any longer. Therefore <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> responsible. Therefore Philippa was innocent.|$|R
60|$|But Mrs. Bolton, though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> victorious, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> to <b>be</b> silenced by {{a single}} word. No more about it, indeed!

5|$|Kirchherr {{admits that}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> good at {{business}} as <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> organised enough, {{and has never}} really looked after the negatives of her photographs to prove ownership. Her business partner Ulf Krüger—a songwriter and record producer—successfully found many of Astrid's negatives and photographs and had them copyrighted, although he believes that Kirchherr has lost £500,000 over the years because of people using her photographs without permission. In July 2001 Kirchherr visited Liverpool to open an exhibition of her work at the Mathew Street art gallery, which {{is close to the}} former site of The Cavern Club. She appeared as a guest at the city's Beatles Week Festival during the August Bank Holiday.

The Ashdown Park hotel in Sussex has been evacuated as a precaution, possibly to do with Scaramella's previous visit there. According to the 6pm Channel 4 (9 December 2006) news the intake of polonium she suffered would only result in a dose of 100 mSv, leading to a 1 in 200 chance of cancer.|$|E

5|$|Swordfish {{was ordered}} from Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company on 18 August 1913 {{although}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> laid down until 28 February 1914. The {{start of the}} First World War six months later greatly hindered her completion, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> launched until 18 March 1916. HMS Swordfish was commissioned on 28 April 1916, before completion, and renamed HMS S1 that same day. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> completed until 21 July.|$|R

Santosh is worried seeing this but has no option rather than staying calm as even Subramaniam did not like Hasini.|$|E

She has two brothers, Craig (Guy Burnett) and Jake (Kevin Sacre), and a sister, Debbie (Jodi Albert). <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> close to her siblings, and has a strained relationship with her mother Frankie, who prefers to involve herself in Craig and Jake's lives and boast about Debbie's professional singing prowess. In contrast, Steph has a very close relationship with her father, Johnno.|$|E
60|$|Five minutes {{afterward}} a {{man came}} running through the town {{with the news that}} old Bonnet's daughter, Miss Kate, had also gone away in the ship. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> at home; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> in the town.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> querulous, nor malevolent; [...] She loved not {{the fierce}} wrangling of women; [...] <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a backbiting serpent, or a liar; [...] She sold not the Son of God for that which passes away.|$|R
60|$|She had {{it ready}} to send with the packet she had tied with red, white, and blue ribbon, when it {{occurred}} to her that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> just to him, that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> giving him a fair chance. He had said he would go and think it over, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> waiting. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> pushing, threatening, compelling. That <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a woman's part. She must leave him free, free, free. She could not accept for her country or herself a forced sacrifice.|$|R
5|$|The {{episode is}} also the first in which Freema Agyeman appears, {{although}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{playing the role of}} Martha Jones, which she would play in series 3, but a minor character named Adeola (who is later revealed to be Martha's cousin). Russell T Davies admired Agyeman's performance as Adeola and called her back to fill the role of companion that Piper had chosen to leave.|$|E
5|$|A {{defendant}} {{does not}} have a right to appointed counsel if he or <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> sentenced to actual imprisonment and could not have been sentenced for more than one year, even if that conviction is later used to enhance sentencing for another crime, or even if the revocation of probation may result in actual imprisonment.

She agrees to meet Lou. He introduces his wife and two daughters and then offers a sincere apology for what happened.

6000|$|Why {{should she}} give her {{allegiance}} to this world, {{and let it}} so dominate her, that her own world of warm sun and growing, sap-filled life was turned into nothing? <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> going to do it. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> going to <b>be</b> a prisoner in the dry, tyrannical man-world. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> going to care about it. What did it matter if her class did ever so badly in the quarterly examination. Let it--what did it matter? ...|$|R
60|$|That <b>was</b> all. Yet <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> glad. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> almost disappointed.|$|R
60|$|She did {{not like}} it. In crowds, in {{assemblies}} of people, she liked formality. She felt she did not produce the right effect. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> effective: <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> beautiful: <b>she</b> <b>was</b> nothing. Even before Skrebensky she felt unimportant, almost inferior. He could take his part very well with the rest.|$|R

However, Danny feels {{comfortable}} talking to Ana, who seems to understand what he has been through. Ana assures Angie <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> going anywhere. Meanwhile, Katherine (Dana Delany) speaks to her psychiatrist at a mental clinic. She says the medicine is working, but she now realizes the person she has become and how much she has hurt her neighbors and friends. Karen (Kathryn Joosten) visits her and asks {{her to come back}} to Wisteria Lane, but Katherine says she will not come back because she does not feel she will be forgiven.

He is also about to slaughter his pet hen, but then changes his mind and lets it go.|$|E
