5000|$|Three {{judges of}} the Federal Court of Australia on 9 October 1979 {{dismissed}} Despoja's appeal against the injunction granted by Mr Justice Smithers. Despoja and <b>Sidic</b> closed {{the doors of}} their [...] "Embassy" [...] two weeks later. According to <b>Sidic,</b> the legal advice they had received was that {{an appeal to the}} High Court could have extended the [...] "Embassy's" [...] life by another eight months but they would have lost the appeal. The flag and insignia at the [...] "Embassy" [...] were to come down under the cover of darkness on 25 October, [...] "to spare the Croatian people the sight of seeing them removed", according to Despoja.|$|E

Dinka <b>Sidic</b> also stood for election but did not receive enough support {{to be one of the}} chosen 30. Special precautions were taken to protect Despoja, as his two predecessors as top vote-getters had died, one supposedly at the hands of Yugoslav assassins.|$|E

5000|$|The Commonwealth's {{arguments}} {{before the}} Federal Court of Australia succeeded on 7 August 1979, when Mr Justice Reginald Smithers granted an injunction against Despoja. The injunction forbade Despoja from displaying any signs, insignia or flags {{giving the impression}} of an embassy and from publicising the [...] "Embassy" [...] as representing {{a part of the}} Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Despoja was ordered to pay the court costs. Despoja's response to the court order was to resign as [...] "chargé d'affaires" [...] and commence as the [...] "Embassy's" [...] "special adviser in non-diplomatic and consular matters".

40|$|Calcium {{signalling}} is {{a highly}} versatile cellular communication system that modulates basic functions such as cell contractility, essential steps of animal development such as fertilization and higher-order processes such as memory. We probed the function of calcium signalling in Drosophila wing imaginal discs {{through a combination of}} ex vivo and in vivo imaging and genetic analysis. Here we discover that wing discs display slow, long-range intercellular calcium waves (ICWs) when mechanically stressed in vivo or cultured ex vivo. These slow imaginal disc intercellular calcium waves (SIDICs) are mediated by the inositol- 3 -phosphate receptor, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium pump SERCA and the key gap junction component Inx 2. The knockdown of genes required for <b>SIDIC</b> formation and propagation negatively affects wing disc recovery after mechanical injury. Our results reveal a role for ICWs in wing disc homoeostasis and highlight the utility of the wing disc as a model for calcium signalling studies...|$|E
