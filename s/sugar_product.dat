25|$|Since the 6th century BC, {{cane sugar}} {{producers}} have crushed the harvested vegetable material from sugarcane {{in order to}} collect and filter the juice. They then treat the liquid (often with lime (calcium oxide)) to remove impurities and then neutralize it. Boiling the juice then allows the sediment to settle to the bottom for dredging out, while the scum rises to the surface for skimming off. In cooling, the liquid crystallizes, usually {{in the process of}} stirring, to produce sugar crystals. Centrifuges usually remove the uncrystallized syrup. The producers can then either sell the <b>sugar</b> <b>product</b> for use as is, or process it further to produce lighter grades. The later processing may take place in another factory in another country.|$|E

50|$|The DE is {{the measure}} of the amount of {{reducing}} sugars present in a <b>sugar</b> <b>product</b> in relation to glucose.

Among the microorganisms Streptococci mutants play the major role in causing dental caries. The aim of this research was to investigate the role of Streptococci mutants in dental caries between two groups of children sensitive and resistance to caries. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional research, in which 120 children(60 susceptible and 60 resistance) aged between 3 to 5 referred to Tehran University dental school were selected randomly. The selection criteria for the sensitive and resistance dental caries were dmfs > 5 and dmfs < 10 respectively. None of the groups had used any drug or fluoride products before sampling.
