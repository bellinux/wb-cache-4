40|$|Abstract—Human {{occupation}} in rural tropical watersheds has been {{contributing to a}} steady degradation of water and other natural resources. Agricultural expansion, deforestation {{and a lack of}} sound <b>sanitary</b> <b>equipments</b> to treat wastewater are conditions that threaten the environmental quality of the Environmental Protection Area of Brilhante (APA Brilhante), located in Santa Catarina, South Brazil. The area, being largely covered by native Atlantic Forest, holds a number of natural springs, important for the overall quality conservation and distribution of water in rural parts of the municipality. In APA Brilhante land use is permitted, but must be done in accordance with the principles of sustainability. To understand the socio-environmental conditions, the possible threats to water quality and to highlight the potential for alternative land uses, a field survey was done based on interviewing families that all lived inside or near the protected area. Results show that degradation of soil and water combined with pollution are the main concerns for the population. If no alternative land use practices are applied, the environmental conditions will continue to degrade. Thus intelligent management, based on socio-environmental understanding, education and effective stakeholder collaboration is needed to protect the landscape and secure the environmental benefits that people can derive from working with nature. The population requests information on how to conserve water, soil and vegetation to protect nature and continue farming for food production. For this reason the study concludes that the Brilhante community possesses great potential for the adaptation of suitable land use practices. This will help APA Brilhante to become a good example of sustainable management for similar protected areas...|$|R

40|$|The Information System of Building Components -ISBC, {{consists}} {{of a set of}} activities to control the graphic data operation procedures of building plans and its storage in a data base. The system is specially prepared to be used by architects, engineers and cad operators who are dealing with a continuous flow of design problems, regarding the permanent adaptation and modification of office's layout in a great amount of buildings around the country. These constant changes bring out several types of architectural design problems that should be taken into consideration by the proposed system, particularly the reallocation of office furniture and the modification of building components. Therefore, the principal goal of the system is based on the inquiry and permanently updating of the data base composed by: furniture, technical equipment (computers and telecommunications networks), lights, air-conditioning, <b>sanitary</b> <b>equipments</b> and any other equipment that can be inventoried. The generation and operation of great amount of graphics and alphanumerical information bring out severe data inconsistency problems, particularly when graphic data is envolved. The task of "feeding" and modifying a data base produces errors that aren't easy to solve, even when specific consistency procedures are used. The ISBC provides the computer routines for the initial task of building up the required data base of each building, allowing to use an interactive algorithm among the digitized plans of each office and the data base of the enquiry system. An additional operation included in the system allows to compute the area of each section of the building in order to calculate several types of working spaces regarding ergonomical and functional performance specifications established by law regulations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:: In a {{previous}} study we found a north-south gradient for Crohn's disease (CD) incidence in France. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine if socioeconomic factors may influence the geographic distribution of CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) in France. METHODS:: Using the national health insurance databases, incidence rates of CD and UC were estimated for each of 341 metropolitan "job areas" in 2000 - 2002. Relationships between incidence rates and relevant contextual variables from the 1999 French census were tested for significance using a Poisson regression. Mapping of smoothed relative risks (sRR) for CD and UC at the scale of job areas, using a Bayesian approach and adjusting for significant contextual variables, was carried out in order to search for geographic variations. RESULTS:: CD incidence rates were negatively related to the percentage of farmers and to the percentage of housing with bathroom and toilets and positively related to the unemployment rate and to the percentage of households below the poverty threshold. Mapping of sRR for CD showed a clear north-south gradient, which was slightly improved after including the percentage of farmers and the percentage of housing with toilets. In UC we found no significant correlation between either incidence and socioeconomic variables or incidence and house equipment variables, and there was no north-south gradient. However, there was a positive and significant correlation between CD and UC incidence. CONCLUSIONS:: The present study shows that geographic risk factors of CD in France are northern latitude, nonrural areas, and areas with poor <b>sanitary</b> house <b>equipment.</b> Among these factors the most important is northern latitude.

These regions differ considerably among them selves {{as well as with}} regard {{to the rest of the}} world, in terms of resources endowment, structure of production, and also in terms of economic reforms, physical infrastructure, and human capital. Our empirical analysis has clearly revealed the importance and the complementarities between macroeconomic reforms, physical infrastructure, human capital and structural reforms for the growth prospects of the economies. These factors have shown a strong effect on growth and have contributed greatly to the growth process for north Africa countries and the non CFA sub Sahara African countries. In north Africa economies and in the Sub Sahara African countries, the lack of macroeconomic reforms, the deficiencies of the physical infrastructure and the human capital explain, although at differing degrees, well the deficit in economic growth.
