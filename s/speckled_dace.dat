5|$|Most {{fish species}} in Johnson Creek {{tolerate}} {{warm water and}} disturbed conditions. These include red-sided shiners, sculpin, suckers, and <b>speckled</b> <b>dace.</b>|$|E
5|$|Native fish in Fossil Creek include {{headwater}} chub, roundtail chub, <b>speckled</b> <b>dace,</b> longfin dace, Sonora sucker, {{and desert}} sucker. Between 2007 and 2010, the Arizona Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service added native spikedace, loach minnows, Gila topminnows, and razorback suckers {{as well as}} more longfin dace above the barrier. All except <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> are special-status fish listed as endangered, threatened, or sensitive by federal or state agencies. In addition, more than 100 macroinvertebrate species live in the Fossil Creek watershed. One, the fossil springsnail, is listed sensitive by the U.S. Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study from}} 2003–2004, there were 13 {{different}} species of fish in the Potlatch River watershed, including <b>speckled</b> <b>dace,</b> longnose dace, rainbow trout (both wild and farm-raised), brook trout, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, northern pikeminnow, redside shiner, sculpin, bridgelip sucker, largescale sucker, and yellow perch. Migration of steelhead, the anadromous phase of rainbow trout, has been impacted by the construction of dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. The two species of dace were cumulatively the largest individual fish population in the watershed, while steelhead accounted for 58.4% of the biomass. Of all the streams sampled during the study, the West Fork Potlatch River had the highest diversity because of its relatively pristine condition. The lower section of the river suffers from chronic pollution caused by agricultural runoff. From 2005 to 2008, the population of steelhead (rainbow) trout in the watershed was recorded by the Potlatch River Steelhead Monitoring and Evaluation Program (PRSME). There was no data for steelhead populations in the main stem but 197 adult steelhead were recorded in the East Fork of the river, while an average of 226 was recorded annually {{in one of the}} river's larger tributaries, Big Bear Creek. Over 1,000 steelhead are estimated to return to the Potlatch drainage in strong run years. Outmigration of steelhead smolt from the East Fork was estimated at 6,976 fish while the average for Big Bear Creek was 9,491. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game began a series of seven projects in 2009 in order to conserve fish habitat in the Potlatch.|$|E
50|$|Dry Well Creek is an {{intermittent}} fish-bearing {{stream that}} flows into Emigrant Creek, {{a tributary of}} the Silvies River. The creek is part of a watershed restoration project. Resident aquatic species in the project area include Great Basin redband trout, Malheur mottled sculpin, <b>speckled</b> and longnose <b>dace,</b> redside shiners, bridgelip suckers, Columbia spotted frogs, crayfish and western pearlshell mussels.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Speckled</b> <b>dace</b> (Rhinichthys osculus) only occurs {{west of the}} Continental Divide in {{the park}} restricting it to the Snake River {{including}} Heart Lake and Fall River drainages.|$|E
25|$|In a 1996 biotic {{assessment}} of upper Searsville Lake {{and the lower}} floodplain of Corte Madera Creek, Stanford biologists wrote that the native species likely included coastal rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus), sculpin, California roach (Hesperoleucas symmetricus), hitch (Lavinia exilcauda), <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> (Rhinichthys osculus), Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis), Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus), and perhaps three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Sacramento pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis), Sacramento blackfish (Orthodon microlepidontus), and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). They noted that the only native species observed with any regularity {{in the study area}} are Sacramento sucker and rainbow trout, and attributed the now depauperate native fish fauna to dislocation of hydrologic connectivity due to the dam, transformation of the habitat above the dam from lotic to lentic, and the fact that Searsville Reservoir harbors many non-native species of centrarchid fishes (sunfish, black bass, and crappie) which prey on virtually all historically native fishes. They noted that federally threatened California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii) occur in the lotic portions of Corte Madera Creek below the dam but not above, likely due to depredation by non-native fish and American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus).|$|E
500|$|The Rogue River {{contains}} [...] "extremely high-quality salmonid {{habitat and}} {{has one of}} the finest salmonid fisheries in the west. However, most stocks are less abundant than they were historically... Salmonids found in the Rogue River downstream of Lost Creek Lake include Coho salmon, spring and fall Chinook salmon, and summer and winter steelhead. Other native species of freshwater fish found in the watershed include coastal cutthroat trout, Pacific lamprey, green sturgeon, white sturgeon, Klamath smallscale sucker, <b>speckled</b> <b>dace,</b> prickly sculpin, and riffle sculpin. Nonnative species include redside shiner, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, catfish, brown bullhead, yellow perch, carp, goldfish, American shad, Umpqua pikeminnow, and species of trout. Coho salmon in the watershed belong to an Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) that was listed by the National Marine Fisheries Service as a threatened species in 1997 and reaffirmed as threatened in 2005. The state of Oregon in 2005 listed Rogue spring Chinook salmon as potentially at risk.|$|E
2500|$|Crooked Creek is a {{tributary}} of the Chewaucan River. [...] The creek provides habitat for crawfish as well as rainbow trout and <b>speckled</b> <b>dace.</b> [...] The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife allows trout fishing on Crooked Creek from mid-May through the end of October.|$|E
2500|$|The reservoir’s {{game fish}} {{includes}} white crappie, yellow perch, bluegill, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, rainbow trout, brown trout, and brook trout.

50|$|<b>Speckled</b> <b>dace</b> (Rhinichthys osculus) Size: 4 ” (10.2 cm)One of {{the most}} {{widespread}} species in western North America, the <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> is found in large numbers throughout the Virgin River and its tributaries. <b>Speckled</b> <b>dace</b> prefer rocky areas but are comfortable living in all habitats and stream sizes. <b>Speckled</b> <b>dace</b> exhibit a kaleidoscope of shapes and colors across their range. Males display bright red “lipstick” and red fins to attract mates during breeding season.|$|E
50|$|The <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> {{is about}} 4 to 5 in long.|$|E
50|$|Canadian {{populations of}} the fish were last sampled in 1977, and then only 400 {{individuals}} were collected. Few of the fish caught were adults, suggesting that <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> mortality may be high. However, not enough data is available to determine accurately whether the population is self-sustaining or in decline. In Canada, the <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> is threatened by its limited habitat and by seasonal flooding.|$|E
50|$|Most {{fish species}} in Johnson Creek {{tolerate}} {{warm water and}} disturbed conditions. These include red-sided shiners, sculpin, suckers, and <b>speckled</b> <b>dace.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Santa Ana <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> (Rhinichthys osculus ssp.) used Strawberry Creek {{until the}} {{combination}} of low flows in the 2003 summer drought and the wildfire and floods in November/December of 2003 apparently wiped out the fish. The Santa Ana <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> are very rare and threatened by human activities such as water withdrawal, barriers to movement and isolation. The habitat supports many threatened, endangered, and Forest Service Sensitive species. The list includes, least Bell's vireo, southwestern willow flycatcher, two-striped garter snake, California spotted owl, and the southern rubber boa. Plans are being made to reintroduce the Santa Ana <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> and mountain yellow legged frog when water conditions are appropriate. The prolonged drought has had a significant affect on streams in southern California {{and their ability to}} support animal species that require surface water.|$|E
50|$|Four {{species of}} fish are known to occur in Red Clover Creek, {{including}} Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Brown trout (Salmo trutta), Mountain sucker (Catostomus platyrhynchus) and <b>Speckled</b> <b>dace</b> (Rhinichthys osculus).|$|E

50|$|The <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> (Rhinichthys osculus), {{also known}} as the spotted dace and the carpita pinta, {{is a member of the}} minnow family. It is found in {{temperate}} freshwater in North America, from Sonora to British Columbia.|$|E
50|$|Fish such as Tui Chub, <b>Speckled</b> <b>Dace,</b> Redside Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, and Great Basin redband trout {{are native}} to Silver Creek and its tributaries. Others, {{including}} rainbow Trout, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch {{were introduced to}} the watershed by humans.|$|E
5000|$|Canada is the {{northern}} {{limit of the}} speckled dace's distribution, {{and there it is}} found only in isolated parts of the Kettle and Granby Rivers. It is possible that, along with the Salish sucker (Catostomus sp.), the <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> {{was one of the first}} fish to recolonize the rivers of British Columbia following the Ice Age. It is believed that spawning in Canada occurs once a year during the summer in fish older than two years. During breeding, many males often accompany a single female who broadcasts adhesive eggs over the gravelly streambed. Each female produces between 200 and 500 eggs. <b>Speckled</b> <b>dace</b> are omnivorous, feeding upon filamentous algae and other plant material, bottom-dwelling aquatic insects and zooplankton.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{reptiles}} {{live in the}} Wilderness, including rattlesnake, chuckwalla, side-blotched lizard, leopard lizard, desert spiny lizard, and collared lizard. The red-spotted toad can be spotted in the canyon and four species of fish are occasionally found in the Paria River - the flannel mouth sucker, bluehead sucker, razorback sucker, and <b>speckled</b> <b>dace.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nevada {{has four}} native game fish: Lahontan and Bonneville {{cutthroat}} trout, Great Basin redband trout, bull trout and mountain whitefish. Introduced game fish include bass, catfish, crappie, walleye and rainbow, brown and brook trout. There are 77 species and subspecies of native nongame fish that reside in Nevada's waters {{ranging from the}} <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> to the razorback sucker.|$|E
50|$|Gila chubs are omnivores, {{and their}} diet mainly {{includes}} aquatic (and terrestrial) insects. These fish are also known to consume other fish at large sizes, which include eating <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> (Rhinichthys osculus) {{and other small}} cyprinid fish. Juveniles feed throughout the day while the adults are out during the early morning and late night; juveniles usually consume insects and algae.|$|E
50|$|The Gila chub (Gila intermedia) is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish in the Cyprinidae family.It is found in Mexico and the United States. The Gila chub {{is closely related to}} Gila robusta robusta and Gila robusta grahami (roundtail chub species). This species is {{commonly}} found in association with the Gila topminnow, the desert and Sonora sucker, and the longfin and <b>speckled</b> <b>dace.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Grass Valley <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> (Rhinichthys osculus reliquus) {{occurred}} in a single spring-fed creek in a grassy meadow in eastern Lander County, Nevada. Specimens were collected only once, in 1938 {{and it was then}} common. The species had a distinctive speckled lower lip and silver sided body. The introduction of brook and rainbow trout to the creek {{is believed to be the}} reason for their extinction.|$|E
50|$|Besides salmonids, native fish {{found in}} the {{watershed}} are the California roach, Sacramento sucker, hitch, <b>speckled</b> <b>dace,</b> three-spined stickleback, and prickly sculpin. Seven nonnative species also exist in the watershed. Three additional species of native fish were present historically: Sacramento perch, last collected in 1960; squawfish, last collected in 1905; and while prickly sculpin have not been collected recently, they may still {{be present in the}} upper tributaries.|$|E
50|$|The creek {{provides}} {{habitat for}} as many as 22 fish species according to a 1982 study, including Sacramento pikeminnow, Sacramento sucker, hardhead, California roach and <b>speckled</b> <b>dace.</b> The creek is host to significant runs of steelhead trout, as well as resident populations of rainbow trout (landlocked steelhead) above the waterfalls in the Gorge which form partial barriers to fish passage. The creek is also home to spring-run chinook salmon.|$|E
50|$|Impassable falls {{are present}} on upper Arroyo Hondo, but the rainbow trout in Smith and Isabel creeks {{are assumed to}} be native, as California roach (Hesperoleucus symmetricus) and Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis) are also present above and below the falls. <b>Speckled</b> <b>dace</b> (Rhinichthys osculus) were {{collected}} by John Otterbein Snyder in 1905 in Arroyo Hondo and Isabel creeks, but not by Scoppettone and Smith in 1978, having disappeared from most of their former sites in the central coast.|$|E
50|$|The reservoir’s {{game fish}} {{includes}} white crappie, yellow perch, bluegill, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, rainbow trout, brown trout, and brook trout. The crappie and perch are particularly sought after by anglers. Crappies over 12 in long are common. The largest crappie ever caught at the reservoir weighed well over 4 lbs kg, an Oregon state record. Perch up to 14 in long are also common at Gerber. Other fish {{found in the}} reservoir include tui chub, blue chub, <b>speckled</b> <b>dace,</b> and shortnose sucker.|$|E
50|$|Impassable falls {{are present}} on upper Arroyo Hondo, but the rainbow trout in Smith and Isabel creeks {{are assumed to}} be native, as California roach (Hesperoleucus symmetricus) and Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis) are also present above and below the falls. <b>Speckled</b> <b>dace</b> (Rhinichthys osculus) were {{collected}} by John Otterbein Snyder in 1898 in Arroyo Hondo and Isabel creeks, but not by Scoppettone and Smith in 1978, nor by Leidy and Bronwen in 2013, and their status in the creek remains uncertain as is true of most of their former sites in the central coast.|$|E
50|$|The 2002 Klamath River {{fish kill}} {{occurred}} on the Klamath River in California in September 2002. According to the official estimate of mortality, about 34,000 fish died. Though some counts may estimate over 70,000 adult chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were killed when returning to the river to spawn, making it the largest salmon kill {{in the history of}} the Western United States. Besides the chinook salmon, other fish that perished include: steelhead (O. mykiss), coho salmon (O. kisutch), sculpins (Cottus spp.), <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> (Rhinichthys osculus), and Klamath smallscale sucker (Catostomus rimiculus).|$|E
50|$|Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge {{features}} approximately 23,000 acres (93 km²) of spring-fed {{wetlands and}} is {{managed by the}} United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The refuge provides habitat for at least 24 plants and animals found nowhere else in the world. Four fish (Devil's Hole Pupfish, Amargosa Pupfish, Warm Springs Pupfish, and Ash Meadows <b>Speckled</b> <b>Dace),</b> one insect (Ash Meadows Naucorid), and one plant (Amargosa Nitewort) are currently listed as endangered species. Ash Meadows NWR can be accessed via SR 373 in Amargosa Valley, SR 160 near Crystal, Nevada or from Bell Vista Road west of Pahrump. Entrances to the refuge are marked with road signs.|$|E
50|$|Loach minnow has an elongated, {{compressed}} {{body with}} its size rarely exceeding 65 mm in length. This species have an olivaceous body, highly blotched with darker pigment. They have dirty-white spots before and behind base of dorsal fin, and on lower and upper sides base of caudal. Breeding males have vivid red-orange markings on bases of fins, body, and lower head. Breeding females become yellow on their fin and lower body.In order to distinguished loach minnow from the similar <b>speckled</b> <b>dace,</b> the loach minnow have whitish spots that are {{present on the}} origin and insertion of the dorsal fin {{as well as on}} the dorsal and ventral portions of the caudal fin base.|$|E
50|$|More {{than twenty}} species of raptors, {{including}} bald eagles and golden eagles, peregrine falcons, and several hawk species, have been observed. The endangered California condor has been re-introduced into this region recently {{due to its}} remote location and lack of human habitation. Desert bighorn sheep, pronghorns, and mountain lions make {{up most of the}} large mammals found here, with about 30 more species of smaller mammals. Several examples of rare fish species, such as the flannelmouth sucker and the <b>speckled</b> <b>dace</b> live in the streams of the National Monument. The Welsh's milkweed, a threatened plant species that grows on sand dunes and helps stabilize them, is known to exist only in this National Monument and one other area in neighboring Utah.|$|E
50|$|The Central Nevada high valleys {{ecoregion}} contains sagebrush-covered rolling valleys {{that are}} generally over 5000 ft in elevation. Alluvial fans spilling {{from the surrounding}} mountain ranges fill the valleys, often leaving little intervening flat ground. Wyoming big sagebrush and associated grasses are common on the flatter areas, and black sagebrush dominates on the volcanic hills and alluvial fans. This ecoregion tends to have lower species diversity than other sagebrush ecoregions, because of its aridity and isolation from more species-rich areas. Saline playas may occur on available flats. Less shadscale and fewer associated shrubs surround these playas than in other, lower more arid ecoregions in the west, including the Lahontan salt shrub ecoregion and the Tonopah Basin ecoregion. Valleys with permanent water support endemic fish populations, such as the Monitor Valley <b>speckled</b> <b>dace.</b>|$|E
