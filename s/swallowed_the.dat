5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is surrounded}} {{at the top}} and bottom by two muscular rings, known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter. These sphincters act to close the esophagus when food is not being <b>swallowed.</b> <b>The</b> esophageal sphincters are functional but not anatomical, meaning that they act as sphincters but do not have distinct thickenings like other sphincters.|$|E
5|$|Prey may {{be crushed}} to death if large or eaten alive if small, {{swallowed}} head-first, and helped down by muscular contractions and neck flexing. Unusually, after food has been <b>swallowed,</b> <b>the</b> Gila monster immediately resumes tongue flicking and search behavior, probably {{as a result}} of a history of finding clumped prey such as eggs and young in nests. Gila monsters are able to climb trees and cacti in search of eggs.|$|E
5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being <b>swallowed,</b> <b>the</b> epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E

5|$|When The Great Silence was {{screened}} for Darryl F. Zanuck of 20th Century Fox {{to see whether}} the film could be released on the American market, he was offended by the film (to the point where he reportedly <b>swallowed</b> <b>the</b> cigar he was smoking in shock upon watching the ending), and refused to distribute it in the United States. 20th Century Fox did, however, distribute the film in Italy and several other markets. The company also considered a remake of the film starring Clint Eastwood, which eventually evolved into a largely unrelated project by Universal Pictures, Joe Kidd.|$|E
5|$|At {{the nursing}} home, the leprechaun {{pretends to be}} O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the well, but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he <b>swallowed</b> <b>the</b> last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into the well, but his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into the well and blows up both the well and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will not rest until he recovers every last piece of his gold.|$|E
5|$|Tarrare crossed Prussian lines {{under cover}} of darkness, {{disguised}} as a German peasant. Unable to speak German, he soon {{attracted the attention of}} local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside Landau. A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission. Brought before the local Prussian commander, General Zoegli, he again refused to talk and was imprisoned. After 24 hours of captivity, Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors. He was chained to a latrine, and eventually, 30 hours after being <b>swallowed,</b> <b>the</b> wooden box emerged. Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be deBeauharnais's dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a gallows and the noose placed around his neck. (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had {{the presence of mind to}} recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.) At the last minute, Zoegli relented, and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold, given a severe beating, and released near the French lines.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} destruction caused to {{the city}} by the tornado was to the town's business district, a three-block stretch of Main Street between First and Fourth Street lined with stores, offices and tenements built of brick and stone. Because of the direction the storm had approached the city from and the angle at which it entered the city, the tornado virtually <b>swallowed</b> <b>the</b> entire business district. It was here that {{a large majority of}} the fatalities occurred, as many of those who thought they would be safe {{within the confines of the}} reinforced structures were killed by cascades of falling debris as the buildings on Main Street were swept away. A 1.5-ton safe from the city bank was thrown a full block away. Probably one of the greatest demonstrations of the tornado's strength was seen at the Nicollet Hotel, a newly constructed three-story brick building located adjacent to the Willow River. The tornado swept the building clean down to the foundation, killing at least five people. Almost simultaneously, the town's Methodist Church was completely obliterated, the only remnant being the 1.1-ton cast iron bell, which was found nearly 200 feet from the church foundation. As the tornado cleared Main Street, it tore the iron-frame bridge spanning the Willow River from its fitting and onto the adjacent riverbank in a twisted heap. The City Hall was completely flattened, the adjacent water tower sent toppling to the northeast and dumping its contents into First Street and transforming it into a muddy deluge. The tornado then moved into the east side of New Richmond, where many of the city's working class residents lived. As many as forty homes in this neighborhood were completely obliterated, leaving the neighborhood virtually unrecognizable. Within a period of roughly seven to ten minutes, over half of New Richmond was laid to ruins.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, even the larger species, {{such as the}} {{reticulated}} python, P. reticulatus, do not crush their prey to death; in fact, prey is not even noticeably deformed before it is <b>swallowed.</b> <b>The</b> speed with which the coils are applied is impressive and the force they exert may be significant, but death is caused by cardiac arrest.|$|E

Although scenes depicting that scenario were cut from the production before broadcast in the United States, they were restored for the VHS and DVD releases.|$|E

25|$|Infection occurs {{by eating}} food or drink {{contaminated}} with Ascaris eggs from feces.

Although the marriage reached a crisis when Macri became chairman of Boca Juniors, {{they did not}} divorce until 2005. He began a romance with María Laura Groba which {{did not lead to}} marriage. Macri left Groba in 2010, began a relationship with businesswoman Juliana Awada and married Awada that year.

25|$|Like many ant-eating animals, the numbat has {{an unusually}} long, narrow tongue, coated with sticky saliva {{produced}} by large submandibular glands. A further {{adaptation to the}} diet {{is the presence of}} numerous ridges along the soft palate, which apparently help to scrape termites off the tongue so they can be <b>swallowed.</b> <b>The</b> digestive system is relatively simple, and lacks many of the adaptations found in other entomophagous animals, presumably because termites are easier to digest than ants, having a softer exoskeleton. Numbats are apparently able to gain a considerable amount of water from their diets, since their kidneys lack the usual specialisations for retaining water found in other animals living in their arid environment. Numbats also possess a sternal scent gland, which may be used for marking their territories.|$|E
25|$|The golden {{trevally}} is a diurnal foraging carnivore which, unlike other carangids, does not normally seek out individual prey items. The highly protractile mouth {{possessed by the}} species is used to form a tube to suck prey out of both reef- and algae-dominated habitats, as well as filtering organisms out of sandy substrates. In the latter case, both sand and any prey items are taken into the mouth and filtered through the gill rakers; sand is expelled, while small organisms are trapped and <b>swallowed.</b> <b>The</b> species takes a variety of prey including crustaceans such as shrimp, crabs, and amphipods, as well as molluscs and small fish. Golden trevally found inhabiting a mangrove swamp {{were found to have}} fed exclusively on fish (Mugil curema), suggesting the species also actively hunts down fleeing prey. A laboratory study using only four individuals being fed found that one fish will take the 'lead' position in this situation while another will attack the other fish in the school, apparently in competition for food.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} the female <b>swallowed</b> <b>the</b> fertilized eggs her stomach was no {{different}} from that of any other frog species. In the jelly around each egg was a substance called prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which could turn off production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. This source of PGE2 was enough to cease the production of acid during the embryonic stages of the developing eggs. When the eggs had hatched the tadpoles created PGE2. The mucus excreted from the tadpoles' gills contained the PGE2 necessary to keep the stomach in a non-functional state. These mucus excretions do not occur in tadpoles of most other species. Tadpoles that don't live entirely off a yolk supply still produce mucus cord, but the mucus along with small food particles travels down the oesophagus into the gut. With Rheobatrachus (and several other species) there is no opening to the gut and the mucus cords are excreted. During the period that the offspring were present in the stomach the frog would not eat.|$|E

25|$|Living {{habits are}} varied; the family {{includes}} both bottom-foraging and midwater species. Callichthyids inhabit {{a wide range}} of habitats, from small, swift, oxygen-rich creeks to big rivers and flooded areas. Their habitats may even include swampy and muddy habitats where oxygen may be virtually absent. Callichthyids survive in these conditions by breathing air; air is collected at the water surface and <b>swallowed.</b> <b>The</b> intestines are used to absorb oxygen, and the air is expelled from the anus. The anterior digestive intestine packages digesta into a string of slightly compressed boluses, creating an air channel in the digestive intestine, thus allowing air to pass unimpeded. The posterior intestine is modified for respiration into a thin-walled and highly vascularized structure by reduction of the thickness of the epithelium, submucosa, and muscle layers; though highly modified to absorb air, it is inefficient for digestive purposes. Air moving through the digestive tract facilitates the movement of digesta to the rectum. Unlike other catfish such as loricariids or trichomycterids that may breathe air only under hypoxic conditions, callichthyids breathe air under all water conditions. Some callichthyids are able to absorb air through their hind guts to move short distances on land. Air stored in their digestive tracts also accounts for 75% of the necessary air for neutral buoyancy.|$|E
25|$|N. americanus and A. duodenale eggs can {{be found}} in warm, moist soil where they will {{eventually}} hatch into first stage larvae, or L1. L1, the feeding non-infective rhabditoform stage, will feed on soil microbes and eventually molt into second stage larvae, L2. L2, which is also in the rhabditoform stage, will feed for approximately 7 days and then molt into the third stage larvae, or L3. L3 is the filariform stage of the parasite, that is, the non-feeding infective form of the larvae. The L3 larvae are extremely motile and will seek higher ground to increase their chances of penetrating the skin of a human host. The L3 larvae can survive up to 2 weeks without finding a host. While N. americanus larvae only infect through penetration of skin, A. duodenale can infect both through penetration as well as orally. After the L3 larvae have successfully entered the host, the larvae then travel through the subcutaneous venules and lymphatic vessels of the human host. Eventually, the L3 larvae enter the lungs through the pulmonary capillaries and break out into the alveoli. They will then travel up the trachea to be coughed and swallowed by the host. After being <b>swallowed,</b> <b>the</b> L3 larvae are then found in the small intestine where they molt into the L4, or adult worm stage. The entire process from skin penetration to adult development takes about 5–9 weeks. The female adult worms will release eggs (N. americanus about 9,000–10,000 eggs/day and A. duodenale 25,000–30,000 eggs/day) which are passed in the feces of the human host. These eggs will hatch in the environment within several days and the cycle will start anew.|$|E
