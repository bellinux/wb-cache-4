40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of several agricultural practices on the sugar beet <b>root</b> <b>aphid</b> (Pemphigus betae Doane) and beneficial epigeal natural enemies in western Nebraska sugar beet agroecosystems. Eight glyphosate-tolerant sugar beet varieties were evaluated under field conditions for their resistance to <b>root</b> <b>aphids.</b> High levels of aphid resistance were detected for some varieties. In conjunction to this, pitfall sampling was conducted to determine the beneficial epigeal natural enemy complex in the area, which could contribute to the management of both <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> and glyphosate-resistant weeds. Ground beetles comprised an important and abundant component of this fauna, with 79 species collected throughout this study. ^ The second investigated {{the impact of a}} seed-applied insecticide (Poncho Beta) and sugar beet plant density (25, 000 plants/acre vs. 35, 000 plants/acre) on <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> and beneficial epigeal arthropods. The insecticide significantly reduced <b>root</b> <b>aphid</b> populations, but not to levels which can be considered adequate control. Soil-dwelling beneficial arthropods remained largely unaffected by the seed-applied insecticides, except for a single ground beetle species (Bembidion quadrimaculatum oppositum) which showed higher activity in the untreated plots during one of the years. Plant density had minimal impact on the aphids and beneficial arthropods. ^ Finally, this study also investigated the impact of tillage (conventional versus reduced tillage) on beneficial epigeal arthropods, and their associated ecosystem services (particularly weed seed consumption and predation of live prey). Overall, the results indicated a strong incentive for adopting reduced tillage practices for sugar beet production, based on increased activity of spiders, centipedes and rove beetles. Although prey consumption remained unaffected by the tillage system used, increased weed seed consumption was observed under the zone tillage system. This study also illustrated the importance of examining important beneficial taxa, such as ground beetles, on the species level rather than on the family level, based on their differing responses to tillage by different species. ...|$|R

25|$|After {{emerging}} in the autumn, the migrant forms of sugarbeet <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> seek out Populus trees to colonize.

25|$|Dispersal {{creates a}} {{relatively}} high mortality rate for sugarbeet <b>root</b> <b>aphids.</b> Additionally, alate aphids incur other disadvantages: if aphids fly then they may incur an additional cost in that their potential fecundity is further reduced {{and there is a}} further delay in the onset of reproduction. The combined effect is a marked reduction in reproductive potential and rate of increase. Although dispersal results in the colonization of suitable plants, it is not always clear what advantages there are in dispersing except from annual plants that are about to die. As dispersal can be costly in terms of fecundity or survival, or both, then sugarbeet <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> are likely to delay departure until host quality falls below the average expectation for the habitat.|$|R
40|$|Three {{species of}} <b>root</b> <b>aphid</b> (Pachypappa vesicalis Koch, Pachypappa tremulae L. and Prociphilus (Stagona) xylostei De Geer) were found feeding on Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karsten] that {{were exposed to}} {{elevated}} concentrations of O 3, and/or SO 2 in a field manipulation experiment at Liphook, England. The experiment exposed conifer trees to controlled concentrations of these gases between 1987 and 1990. Root-aphid populations feeding on Norway spruce were monitored in autumn 1990, {{the third year of}} fumigation and in autumn 1991, 10 months after fumigation had ceased. In 1990 the numbers of aphids in the high-SO 2, high-SO 2 + O 3 and O 3 treatments were significantly less than in ambient plots. Although after fumigation had ceased in 1991 the ambient plots still had higher numbers than the treatment plots, most of these differences were no longer statistically significant. In all plots sampled, total numbers of <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> were higher in 1991 than in 1990. These results indicate that the numbers of <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> in the experiment were negatively related to pollution levels. This relationship is the same as that shown in controlled laboratory experiments and is the converse of that generally reported in experiments using shoot-feeding aphids...|$|R
40|$|<b>Strawberry</b> <b>roots</b> were sampled {{through the}} year to {{determine}} the populations and distribution of Pratylenchus penetrans and Meloidogyne hapla. Three <b>strawberry</b> <b>root</b> types were sampled—structural roots; feeder roots without secondary tissues; and suberized, black perennial roots. Both lesion and root-knot nematodes primarily infected feeder roots from structural roots or healthy perennial roots. Few nematodes were recovered from soil, diseased roots, or suberized roots. Lesion nematode recovery was correlated with healthy roots. In both 1997 and 1998, P. penetrans populations peaked about day 150 (end of May) and then declined. The decline in numbers corresponded to changes in total <b>strawberry</b> <b>root</b> weight and root type distribution. The loss of nematode habitat resulted from loss of roots due to disease and the transition from structural to suberized perennial roots. Meloidogyne hapla juvenile recovery peaked around 170 days (mid June) in 1997 and at 85, 147, 229, and 308 days (late March, late May, mid August, and early November, respectively) in 1998.

Choice assays were conducted in an Y-tube olfactometer filled with moist sand. Infective juveniles were activated {{by the presence of}} intact <b>roots</b> of both <b>strawberry</b> and thuja plants. Some nematodes aggregated in the compartments with roots but most moved away from the roots to the opposite side. Given a choice, IJs showed a preference for <b>strawberry</b> <b>roots</b> above O. sulcatus larvae. No difference in preference was observed between thuja roots and O. sulcatus larvae. The combination of <b>strawberry</b> <b>roots</b> with vine weevil larvae was preferred above roots alone. In the assays with thuja roots and larvae versus thuja roots alone, however, IJs were stimulated to move but showed preference for the opposite compartment away from the arms with roots and larvae. Nematodes responded differently to mechanically damaged roots as opposed to roots damaged by vine weevil larvae. In assays with damaged thuja roots, IJs were most attracted by the roots damaged by larvae, whereas in the strawberry assays IJs showed a clear preference for the mechanically damaged roots. When challenged with a choice between <b>strawberry</b> and thuja <b>roots,</b> IJs moved preferentially to strawberry than to thuja roots.
