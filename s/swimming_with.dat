5|$|Blacknose {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger sharks, and captives have been {{observed}} to perform an apparent threat display towards encroaching divers or newly introduced members of their species. The display consists of the shark hunching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, gaping its jaws, and <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> an exaggerated side-to-side motion. Known parasites of this species include the copepods Nesippus orientalis, Perissopus dentatus, Pandarus sinuatus, Kroyeria sphyrnae, Nemesis atlantica, and Eudactylina spinifera, as well as tapeworms in the genera Paraorygmatobothrium and Platybothrium.|$|E

5|$|The {{parents also}} took turns feeding their chick. According to one account, the chick {{was covered with}} grey down. The young bird took {{only two or three}} weeks to mature enough to abandon the nest and land for the water, {{typically}} around the middle of July. The parents cared for their young after they fledged, and adults would be seen <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> their young perched on their backs. Great auks matured sexually when they were four to seven years old.|$|E

Zimbabwe has also competed at Wimbledon and the Davis Cup in tennis, most notably with the Black family, which comprises Wayne Black, Byron Black and Cara Black. Zimbabwe has also done well in golf. The Zimbabwean Nick Price held the official World Number 1 status longer than any player from Africa has ever done in the 24-year history of the ranking.|$|E
5|$|Cage diving is {{most common}} at sites where great whites are {{frequent}} including {{the coast of}} South Africa, the Neptune Islands in South Australia, and Guadalupe Island in Baja California. The popularity of cage diving and <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> sharks is at {{the focus of a}} booming tourist industry. A common practice is to chum the water with pieces of fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the divers.|$|E

5|$|Copenhagen is {{recognized}} as one of the most environmentally friendly cities in the world. As a result of its commitment to high environmental standards, Copenhagen has been praised for its green economy, ranked as the top green city for the second time in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index (GGEI). In 2001 a large offshore wind farm was built just off the coast of Copenhagen at Middelgrunden. It produces about 4% of the city's energy. Years of substantial investment in sewage treatment have improved water quality in the harbour to an extent that the inner harbour can be used for <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> facilities at a number of locations.|$|E
5|$|Ford and Martin (2010) {{proposed}} that Psittacosaurus was semi-aquatic, <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> its tail like a crocodile, and paddling and kicking. They based their interpretation on evidence including: the lacustrine (lake) depositional setting of many specimens; {{the position of}} the nostrils and eyes; interpretations of the motions of the arms and legs; tails with long chevrons (and with the bristles on the tail interpreted as possibly skin-covered, forming a fin), providing a propulsive surface; and the presence of gastroliths, interpreted as ballast. They further suggested that some species of Psittacosaurus were more terrestrial than others.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{initially}} {{aspired to}} be a professional footballer, but spondylolysis forced him out of the sport. After joining the National Youth Theatre and studying Drama and Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia, he became an actor in 2003, performing in plays like Murder in the Cathedral, Fresh Kills, The History Boys, and On the Shore of the Wide World in London theatres. Extending his repertoire into West End theatre, he has since performed in the stage adaptation of <b>Swimming</b> <b>with</b> Sharks with Christian Slater, followed a year later by a critically acclaimed performance as Henry in That Face.|$|E

5|$|The {{water that}} {{flows through the}} Roman Baths is {{considered}} unsafe for bathing, partly due to its having passed through the still-functioning original lead pipes, and up until World War II, it was advertised {{on the basis of}} the radioactivity it contained. However, the more significant danger is now considered to be infectious diseases. In October 1978, a young girl <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> the Bath Dolphins, a local swimming club, in the restored Roman Bath contracted meningitis and died, leading to the closure of the bath for several years. Tests showed that Naegleria fowleri, an extremely dangerous disease-causing amoeba, was in the water. The newly constructed Thermae Bath Spa nearby, designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, and the refurbished Cross Bath allow modern-day bathers to experience the waters via a series of more recently drilled boreholes.|$|E
5|$|Enaliarctos, {{a fossil}} species of late Oligocene/early Miocene (24–22 mya) California, closely resembled modern pinnipeds; it was adapted to an aquatic {{life with a}} {{flexible}} spine, and limbs modified into flippers. Its teeth were adapted for shearing (like terrestrial carnivorans), {{and it may have}} stayed near shore more often than its extant relatives. Enaliarctos was capable of <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> both the fore-flippers and hind-flippers, but it may have been more specialized as a fore-flipper swimmer. One species, Enaliarctos emlongi, exhibited notable sexual dimorphism, suggesting that this physical characteristic may have been an important driver of pinniped evolution. A closer relative of extant pinnipeds was Pteronarctos, which lived in Oregon 19–15 mya. As in modern seals, Pteroarctos had an orbital wall that was not limited by certain facial bones (like the jugal or lacrimal bone), but was mostly shaped by the maxilla.|$|E
5|$|How the ostensibly weak-swimming {{frilled shark}} captures active, {{fast-moving}} squid {{is a matter}} of speculation. One possibility is that it takes advantage of injured squid, or those that are exhausted and dying after spawning. Alternatively, it may surprise its prey by curving its body and, bracing itself with its posteriorly positioned fins, launching a quick strike forward {{in the manner of a}} snake. It may also be able to close its gill slits and create negative pressure to suck prey into its mouth. The many small, sharp, recurved teeth of the frilled shark are functionally similar to squid jigs and could easily snag the body or tentacles of a squid, particularly as they are rotated outwards when the jaws are protruded. Observations of captive frilled sharks <b>swimming</b> <b>with</b> their mouths open suggest that the small teeth, light against the dark mouth, may even fool squid into attacking and entangling themselves.|$|E
