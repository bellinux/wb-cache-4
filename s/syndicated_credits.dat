Large US and European banks originate loans for emerging market borrowers and allocate them to local banks. Euro area banks have expanded pan-European lending and have found funding outside the euro area. JEL classification: G 100, G 200. Syndicated loans are credits granted {{by a group of}} banks to a borrower. They are hybrid instruments combining features of relationship lending and publicly traded debt. They allow the sharing of credit risk between various financial institutions without the disclosure and marketing burden that bond issuers face. <b>Syndicated</b> <b>credits</b> are a very significant source of international financing, with signings of international syndicated loan facilities accounting for no {{less than a third of}} all international financing, including bond, commercial paper and equity issues (Graph 1). This special feature presents a historical review of the development of this increasingly global market and describes its functioning, focusing on participants, pricing mechanisms, primary origination and secondary trading. It also gauges its degree of geographical integration. We find that large US and European banks tend to originate loans for emerging market borrowers and allocate them to local banks. Euro area banks seem to have expanded pan-European lending and have found funding outside the euro area. Development of the market The evolution of syndicated lending can be divided into three phases. Credit syndications first developed in the 1970 s as a sovereign business. On the eve of the sovereign default by Mexico in 1982, most of developing countries ’ debt consisted of syndicated loans.

40|$|THIS THESIS EXPLORES the micro-structure of {{the market}} for {{syndicated}} loans from the demand and supply side and aims to provide a detailed micro-economic analysis. The focus is on the determinants of loan pricing to both developing and industrialised countries. Particular attention is paid to the characteristics of both lenders and borrowers. The thesis comprises four papers. Paper 1 defines key concepts and provides a historical outlook on the international market for syndicated loans since the late 1970 s. Paper 2 analyses in an extensive risk-return framework the determinants of the pricing of <b>syndicated</b> <b>credits</b> granted to developing country borrowers between 1993 and 2001. It concludes that risk is properly reflected in loan pricing, although the effect of purely micro-economic price determinants is in several instances weaker when variables reflecting macro-economic conditions in borrowers' countries are also introduced into the model. Analysis of market structure allows us to make inferences about the effects of bank market power and perceived risk concentration in syndicated lending to developing country borrowers. Paper 3 extends the second one in a first attempt to our knowledge to analyse the determinants of the pricing of developing and industrialised country loans and bonds taken together in the 1990 s. On average, we find that developing country bonds have been riskier than developing country loans and industrialised country loans riskier than industrialised country bonds. We analyse how spill-over effects may have taken place from one market segment to the other {{in the wake of the}} Asian financial crisis. We also compare market access and structure on the respective market segments. We find that banks and investors may have exercised their market power to the greatest extent or that the penalising effect of higher perceived risk concentration may have been most pronounced in the case of bank loans being made to developing country borrowers. Paper 4 is the first of its kind to investigate the effects of bank characteristics on the structure and pricing of syndicated loans at an international level, using a unique dataset. We show that the pricing of loans is likely to be lower as banks participating in those loans become less liquidity-constrained or better capitalised, or enjoy a regulatory advantage. The relationship between bank characteristics and loan pricing generally appears to be stronger in the case of senior banks than of junior banks. This confirms the stronger pricing power of senior banks when arranging loans, while junior participants tend to act more as price takers. Contrary to the existing literature we find evidence of senior banks offloading larger shares of riskier loans in a potentially opportunistic way to outsider junior banks with little knowledge of the borrower. They also tend to hold higher portions of loans they arrange when they are better capitalised. In addition, as information about the borrower becomes less transparent, junior banks rely more on the reputation of the senior bank, to determine their level of commitment, than when borrower information is widely available to the public...|$|E

Furthermore, we report that financial institutions and public utilities are able to negotiate for cheaper loans, but this result is reversed when financing is for acquisition purposes.

40|$|I {{examine the}} primary market for <b>syndicated</b> private <b>credit</b> {{agreements}} to U. S. firms {{within the context}} of contract theory with information asymmetries between contracting parties in a repeated game. Specific governance mechanisms determine a firm 2 ̆ 7 s cost of borrowing in <b>syndicated</b> <b>credit</b> agreements. Firms with governance mitigating agency risk between stakeholders, i. e. independent boards, strong shareholder monitoring, and greater CEO pay-performance sensitivity, enjoy lower borrowing costs. The interests of creditors and shareholders diverge with regard to external governance. Lenders charge higher spreads to firms at greater risk of acquisition and reward stronger firms with price concessions when they possess staunch anti-takeover provisions. With regard to the networks I find that CFO centrality, the size and influence of network connections, affects the structure and cost of firm private debt. Specifically, powerfully networked CFOs negotiate more flexible contracts and lower loan spreads. More favorable loan terms {{do not appear to be}} inappropriate as these borrowers do not subsequently under-perform relative to their peers. I conclude that CFO centrality decreases information asymmetries and agency problems through increased information flows and reputational effects. The syndication process itself is a two stage process. The first stage is the underwriting process wherein lead arrangers perform due diligence on the borrower and the parties agree to loan terms. The second stage is the syndication process wherein lead arrangers invite non-arrangers to participate in the primary offering. I find that asymmetric information and agency concerns affect not only the terms of the loan but also the structure of the syndicate. Greater information asymmetry increases loan spreads and the concentration of the syndicate; non-lead arrangers are less willing to participate in the offering when information asymmetries are more severe between borrowers and non-lead arrangers and between underwriters and participant lenders. I find that when the proposed spread differs from that of a typical offering potential creditors are less willing to participate, that is, an atypical spread is itself an indicator of asymmetric information between originators and potential participants. These effects are mitigated, but not eliminated, by previous lending relationships between borrowers and lenders and previous lead-participant syndications...|$|R

40|$|Since early 1984, note {{issuance}} facilities (NIFs) have {{in considerable}} degree replaced <b>syndicated</b> Eurocurrency bank <b>credits</b> in international credit markets, especially for borrowers in industrial countries, because borrowers have found it cheaper to bypass bank syndications and obtain funds more directly by issuing Euronotes.

Most NIFs arranged so far have not been drawn on through issuance of notes, and few of the actual issuers have arranged LIBOR-priced Eurocredits recently. In the 12 cases, as of mid- 1985, where meaningful comparisons could be made, it appears that the cost savings to the borrowers ranged from about 10 to around 50 basis points. All of the savings were in the interest spread, where the NIFs appear to have been about 15 to 55 basis points cheaper.

40|$|The {{affordable}} housing {{crisis in the}} United States is real and persistent. In the face of growing economic inequality {{and the failure of}} public housing programs, American cities need the development industry to deliver more {{affordable housing}} units than ever before. Instead, the affordable housing development process is regarded as a fragmented nexus involving multiple public and private sector parties. Raising capital for affordable housing projects is notoriously complex; it is common to see individual apartment buildings funded by a mix of any of the following: public grants, federal tax <b>credits</b> <b>syndicated</b> through private lenders, interest-free debt from community lenders and municipalities, mortgage debt from commercial lenders and private equity. A good affordable housing developer must be adept at understanding the covenants and eligibility requirements of every source of funds as part of the development process, and work with the myriad parties to compete or apply for funds. This long and convoluted process raises high barriers to entry into the industry and slows down the production of a public good. This thesis investigates the possibility of an alternative funding model for affordable housing development and proposes that developers go public to raise capital, adopting the same tried-and-tested method of financing real estate development that commercial developers have relied on for nearly 30 years. This thesis will argue that a REIT can function as an organizing mechanism to simplify the process of raising capital across different pools of institutional equity, private wealth and public funding. By being able to turn to the widest capital markets for fundraising, affordable housing developers can be nimble in choosing when to raise capital and flexible in deploying it to build experimental mixed-income and workforce housing, two typologies of housing that have been identified as helping to make urban areas more inclusive. Through this thesis, I posit that the affordable housing development REIT can serve as the central platform to consolidate the various pools of triple-bottom- line investors and to create {{for the first time a}} public market for an asset class that exhibits all the features of a stable, long term core investment. by Xiang Ying Estelle ChanThesis: S.

40|$|Introduction A {{revised version}} of this paper has been {{released}} in July 2009. The origins of BIS activities in the field of international financial statistics go back to the mid- 1960 s and the emergence of the so-called eurocurrency markets that had sprung up to circumvent domestic regulations. At that time the key policy concern that gave rise to the joint data collection exercise by the central banks of the G 10 countries {{under the aegis of the}} BIS was the need to monitor the rapid growth of these markets and its possible monetary implications. This led to the introduction of reporting by internationally active banks of their international positions in major individual currencies, with a geographical and partial sectoral breakdown. On the basis of these reports the central banks and the BIS compiled the so-called locational banking statistics for various lending and borrowing countries. In the subsequent years, the issue of recycling the current account surpluses of oil-producing countries shifted the emphasis in favour of a more detailed geographical breakdown and of flow data. In the context of the deregulation of domestic financial systems and capital flows in the 1970 s and 1980 s these concerns abated, but in their place came others, notably the rise in the indebtedness of many developing countries to international banks in the early 1980 s. This build-up was visible in the existing locational banking statistics collected and published by the BIS, but it was not possible to evaluate in a comprehensive way the risk characteristics of the exposures of national banking systems to individual borrowing countries. The need for such information therefore led to the reporting of a second set of international banking data on a fully consolidated basis. A maturity breakdown of the consolidated banking claims was also introduced at that time. In response to calls for more up-to-date information on the international lending activities of banks, the BIS began in the early 1990 s to collect and publish data on signed <b>syndicated</b> <b>credit</b> facilities. More recently, with the objective of enhancing the analysis of country risk exposures, efforts have been made to achieve a more complete and detailed reporting of consolidated banking data on an ultimate risk basis, including off-balance sheet positions relating to bank's derivatives transactions. As a result of the increasing role of the international securities markets in global financial intermediation, the BIS was mandated in the mid- 1980 s to collect and publish statistics on these markets on the basis of data from commercial databases and information available to individual central banks. In the 1990 s the BIS also became increasingly involved in the coordination of joint surveys that central banks carried out on a regular basis to monitor activity in global foreign exchange markets. Moreover, as derivatives markets expanded in the wake of financial innovation, central banks asked the BIS to collect and publish international data on exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives transactions. The development of the BIS international financial statistics thus reflects evolving central bank concerns relating to monetary and financial stability in the context of worldwide financial market deregulation, innovation and globalisation. In addition to their use for policy-related monitoring purposes by central banks, the international financial statistics have meanwhile proved to be of interest to private sector market participants. The latter have come to recognise the unique value of the BIS data for tracking the borrowing by emerging market countries from the international banking and securities markets. The BIS data are also used by the IMF in the compilation of its international financial statistics and in its surveillance of individual economies. Moreover, the BIS data have proved to be useful for improving balance of payment statistics and for measuring and monitoring developing countries' foreign debt. With respect to the latter, following the 1997 Asian debt crisis the IMF, OECD, World Bank and BIS pooled their respective statistics to collectively publish data from creditor and market sources on countries' foreign indebtedness. Apart from providing insights into the geographical distributions of international financial flows and external vulnerabilities and risk exposures of debtors and creditors, the international financial statistics collected and disseminated by the BIS contain important information on the structural developments in international financial markets. They can be used, for instance, to analyse the importance of individual financial centres (including so-called offshore centres), the emergence of new relationships between financial and non-financial firms, the level and concentration of activity in financial markets as well as spillovers between different market segments. Much of this is not easily available elsewhere. The statistics become even more valuable when they are combined with other sources covering financial asset prices, market liquidity and trading patterns, external ratings, and the activity of non-bank financial firms and non-financial companies. They then allow market participants and policymakers to make an assessment of credit and liquidity risks in domestic and international financial markets as well as of potential vulnerabilities to systemic disturbances in these markets. The usefulness of the international financial statistics is, of course, potentially affected by the fact that the boundaries between international and domestic markets are becoming more blurred. This could, on the one hand, constitute a weakness of the statistics as it may become increasingly difficult to define and distinguish pure international financial market activity from that in domestic markets. On the other hand, as this guide explains and illustrates, the methodology of the international statistics has tried to keep pace with such developments and to ensure that financial analysts are aware of the limitations of the statistics. Moreover, given that financial innovations have often started in the competitive environment of the international financial markets and that market sentiments are becoming increasingly correlated internationally, the BIS statistics have been and continue to be a very useful tool to capture structural and market developments in global markets at an early stage. The BIS, and the central banking community working through it, have also taken steps to complement the publication of the international financial statistics with a selection of highlights and analyses of major market trends. In the case of the BIS this applies to the press releases accompanying the release of new data; to the BIS Quarterly Review, which contains more in-depth analysis of specific issues, and to its Annual Report, which analyses long-term trends and emerging policy issues. The statistics are also mentioned and explained regularly in presentations by senior BIS officials to central banks, market participants and academics. Other initiatives to promote the use of the statistics include making them available in electronic form on the BIS website and updating the guidelines and methodological notes on a regular basis. Work on collecting, compiling and disseminating the BIS international financial statistics is closely related to, and guided by, the activities of the various Basel-based committees and expert groups as well as those of other international institutions. The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) plays a key role in reaching a consensus on priorities to improve the BIS statistics. With respect to international banking data, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is consulted on methodological issues to help ensure the collection of adequate statistical information from internationally active banks on risk exposures. The Financial Stability Forum (FSF) has also formulated a number of recommendations to enhance statistics on international financial markets and capital flows that are taken into account by the BIS in its statistical work. As a result of the strong support of these groups it has been possible to improve on the reporting frequency and timeliness of the international financial statistics in recent years. One of the major underlying objectives of the various Basel-based groups is to strengthen financial stability through transparency and market discipline. Increased public disclosure plays a key role in this and should, over time, lead to better quantitative and qualitative information on the activities and risk profiles of individual institutions as well as market infrastructures such as payment, settlement and trading systems. With respect to the functioning of domestic and international financial markets, various proposals have been made to complement the BIS statistics on banking, securities, foreign exchange and derivatives markets over time by improved aggregate information on liquidity, leverage and position-taking in these markets. More recently the IMF has been elaborating a methodology for the collection by individual countries of comprehensive financial soundness indicators, which should complement the BIS statistics. The disclosure framework on the exposures and capital structure of internationally active banks proposed under the New Basel Capital Accord (its so-called Pillar III) should contribute to better balance sheet data of individual internationally active banks. This Guide is structured around the three main areas of the BIS international financial statistics: the international banking statistics (Part II); the securities statistics (Part III); and the derivatives and foreign exchange statistics (Parts IV and V). It also provides a description of the joint BIS-IMF-OECD-World Bank statistics on external debt for which the BIS is a main contributor of data (Part VI). The guide provides a detailed description of the sources, compilation, transformation and publication of the data. Two separate chapters on the quality and the uses of the statistics (Parts VII and VIII) follow the description of the statistics. A more detailed description of the BIS international banking statistics and their underlying methodology is provided in a separate guide. This Guide has been prepared by Paul Van den Bergh, Rainer Widera, Karsten von Kleist, Jesper Wormstrup and others in the Monetary and Economic Department of the BIS. Chapter VIII draws largely on an article by Philip Wooldridge. ...|$|R
