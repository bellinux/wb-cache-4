5|$|In 1935, Barbera {{created his}} first solo-effort {{storyboard}} about a character named Kiko the Kangaroo. The storyline was of Kiko {{in an airplane}} race with another character called Dirty Dog. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> efforts..."I was, quite honestly, {{not in the least}} disappointed. I had proven to myself that I could do a storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. For now, that was enough."The original storyboard, which had been passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.|$|E
5|$|Though Evans was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} against the clock, Schleck had surpassed expectations in the long time trial at the 2010 Tour de France, leading to speculation as to whether his 57-second cushion over the Australian could be sufficient for him to win the Tour. Evans rode {{one of the best}} time trials of his career, finishing in second place seven seconds off the pace of Tony Martin, the rider who was crowned world time trial champion later that year. Andy <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> and his brother's rides that they were probably the best time trials likewise of their respective careers, but they were no match for Evans' performance. The Australian was two and a half minutes better than both of them, taking the overall lead by {{a minute and a half}} with Andy slipping to second and Fränk to third. Since the Tour's final stage is traditionally mostly ceremonial save for a final sprint finish, the time trial effectively cemented the final overall standings. Andy took the positive from the result, saying he and his brother were both proud of each other for their efforts and were excited to stand on the podium together in Paris, even if neither of them was on the top step.|$|E

Helen Phillips <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{performance}} as Little John, [...] "excellently played by Clive Mantle, the series' John at first appears to conform to a, by then, well- established stereotype." [...] Mantle has <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> role: It is the job I've enjoyed doing {{more than anything else}} on TV. I have the greatest memories of beautiful, halcyon days-out filming on location and we had such a great, fun crew working on the show. We still get together once a year. Not just the cast but also the directors, producer, props guys, it's like a family! I think the key to part of the series' success was that this great camaraderie came across on screen.|$|E
