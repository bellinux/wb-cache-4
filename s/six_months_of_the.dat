5|$|As the {{publication}} date neared, difficulties arose. In January 1869, Dallas asked Trollope {{for permission to}} defer serial publication by three months. As Trollope had agreed not to allow another of his novels to run serially during the first <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Vicars career, the editor's request would have diminished the author's income. Trollope initially refused, but subsequently agreed to a delay of two months, with publication to begin in early July.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Sevigny {{began her}} five-season {{run in the}} HBO {{television}} series Big Love, about a family of fundamentalist Mormon polygamists. She played Nicolette Grant, the conniving, shopaholic daughter of a cult leader and second wife to a polygamist husband, played by Bill Paxton. Sevigny found even more mainstream success with a role in her first big-budget production as Robert Graysmith's wife Melanie in David Fincher's Zodiac (2007), telling {{the true story of}} San Francisco's infamous Zodiac Killer. In 2009, Sevigny starred in the independent psychological thriller film The Killing Room, and Werner Herzog's My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done, a crime horror film based on murderer Mark Yavorsky, produced by David Lynch. Sevigny also had a voice part in the independent documentary film, Beautiful Darling (2010), narrating the life of trans woman Warhol superstar Candy Darling through Darling's diaries and personal letters. Throughout 2009, Sevigny continued working on Big Loves fourth season; when filming the series, she spent <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year living outside of Los Angeles near Santa Clarita, away from her home in New York City.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly {{continued}} {{to work as a}} schoolteacher after he broke into international cricket, {{but at the end of}} 1934, after missing more than <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year in England, he resigned from his government post, reasoning that his career could not progress if he was going to be overseas so often. However, he had not made any plans for his future employment. Soon after, O'Reilly received an offer to work as a sportsgoods salesman for the department store David Jones with sporting leave entitlements. The Premier of New South Wales, Bertram Stevens, tried to coax O'Reilly into staying in the government education system, offering him a post at Sydney Boys High School if he returned to STC to complete the Bachelor of Arts that he had abandoned a decade before.|$|E

5|$|Scientific Atlanta's first {{business}} {{focus was}} antennas for military and industrial use. Finances were tight at the fledgling firm. When {{they could not}} afford an automatic antenna pattern recorder, of which there was only one such machine on the market, Robinson decided to build his own. When word in the industry spread companies began contacting Scientific Atlanta. Within <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development of the device, Robinson sold units to Western Electric, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, General Electric, Convair, American Machine and Foundry, and many other large corporations of the era. Within eight years of operating, the firm had captured 60% of the global market share of electronic instruments for testing and designing antennas, had broken ground on a 25 acre facility in Northeast Atlanta, and had 240 employees on the payroll including 40 engineers.|$|E
5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty was {{a mutual}} naval arms {{limitation}} and disarmament treaty between the five major naval {{powers of the}} time: the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Japan, Italy, and France. One of the main aspects of the treaty was the limitation on the number and size of capital ships each nation possessed; as the RAN was counted {{as part of the}} Royal Navy {{for the purposes of the}} treaty, Australia was one of the battlecruisers nominated for disposal to meet the British limit. The battlecruiser had to be made unusable for warlike activities within <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treaty's ratification, then disposed of by scuttling, as Australia did not have the facilities to break her up for scrap, and the British share of target ships was taken up by Royal Navy vessels. This was the only time the Australian military has been affected by a disarmament treaty until the 1997 Ottawa Treaty banning the use of anti-personnel mines.|$|E
5|$|The 1936–37 MCC tour of Australia under G.O. Allen was the {{occasion}} of Cardus's {{first visit to the}} country. During the tour he made, or consolidated, friendships with players and colleagues including C. B. Fry and Donald Bradman. Fry, a former England cricket captain, was a boyhood hero of Cardus, and was covering the Tests for the London Evening Standard. In Bradman, Cardus found a sophistication and sensitivity that other writers had failed to detect. When interviewed on his arrival in Australia, Cardus speculated how he would cope for the <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tour without music; he was touched when the following day music students in Perth gave him a private recital of music by Chopin and Hugo Wolf. During this tour Cardus wrote for The Herald in Melbourne, and broadcast about cricket on Australian radio.|$|E

5|$|The Civil War refocused {{discussions about}} the road. There were fears that Great Britain would enter {{on the side of}} the Confederacy during the early days of the war. British troops were as close to Michigan as Ontario, and more than half of the copper used in the US came from mines along the {{proposed}} roadway. Control of the area could have been established by seizing the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, severing communication lines through the Great Lakes. If the locks fell to an enemy force, no troops or supplies could be moved to the Copper Country except by land. The road was also needed during the five or <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year that transportation on the Great Lakes was barred by ice or stormy weather.|$|E
5|$|Many {{circumstances}} surrounding the film—including its unusual budget, length, and production time, {{as well as its}} similarities to the 1901 New York attraction—indicate that Méliès was especially keen to release the film in the United States. Because of rampant film piracy, Méliès never received most of the profits of the popular film. One account reports that Méliès sold a print of the film to the Paris photographer Charles Gerschel for use in an Algiers theatre, under strict stipulation that the print only be shown in Algeria. Gerschel sold the print, and various other Méliès films, to the Edison Manufacturing Company employee Alfred C. Abadie, who sent them directly to Edison's laboratories to be duplicated and sold by Vitagraph. Copies of the print spread to other firms, and by 1904 Siegmund Lubin, the Selig Polyscope Company, and Edison were all redistributing it. Edison's print of the film was even offered in a hand-colored version available at a higher price, just as Méliès had done. Méliès was often uncredited altogether; for the first <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film's distribution, the only American exhibitor to credit Méliès in advertisements for the film was Thomas Lincoln Tally, who chose the film as the inaugural presentation of his Electric Theater.|$|E
5|$|Once {{rebuilding}} began, {{the poor}} rebuilt their basic {{housing in the}} same primitive fashion as before. By contrast, the wealthiest residents, both secular and spiritual, became caught in an almost manic orgy of building. Most members of the nobility had several homes in Sicily. For one thing, the Spanish viceroy spent <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year in Palermo and six in Catania, holding court in each city, and hence members of the aristocracy needed a town palazzo in each city. Once the palazzi in devastated Catania were rebuilt in the new fashion, the palazzi in Palermo seemed antiquated by comparison, so they too were eventually rebuilt. Following this, {{from the middle of}} the 18th century, villas to retire to in the autumn, essentially status symbols, were built at the fashionable enclave at Bagheria. This pattern was repeated, on a smaller scale, throughout the lesser cities of Sicily, each city providing a more entertaining social life and a magnetic draw for the provincial aristocrat than their country estate. The country estate also did not escape the building mania. Often Baroque wings or new façades were added to ancient castles, or country villas were completely rebuilt. Thus the frenzy of building gained momentum until the increasingly fantastical Baroque architecture demanded by these hedonistic patrons reached its zenith in the mid-18th century.|$|E
