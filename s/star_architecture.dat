50|$|A {{variety of}} systems {{based on the}} basic 6600/7600 {{architecture}} were repackaged in different price/performance categories of the CDC Cyber, which became CDC's main product line in the 1970s. An updated version of the <b>STAR</b> <b>architecture,</b> the Cyber 205, had considerably better performance than the original. By this time, however, Cray's own designs, like the Cray-1, were using the same basic design techniques as the STAR, but were computing much faster.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} {{algorithm is}} also capable of identifying faults in some static network structures including {{two of the}} most popular ones, hypercubes and star-graph networks. These two networks have been approved for their promising topological properties. To apply the proposed algorithm, it suffices to show that branching <b>star</b> <b>architectures</b> can be embedded into them.|$|R
50|$|The {{architecture}} of a pH sensitive polymer {{is important because}} it can affect the practical applications of the polymer. For example, researchers have compared copolymers with linear and four-armed <b>star</b> <b>architectures.</b> The copolymers had the same composition, but the researchers observed different water contact angles (used to indicate hydrophobicity of a surface) and different drug release patterns for the different architectures.|$|R
40|$|Three-armed {{biodegradable}} star polymers {{made from}} polystyrene (polySt) and poly (polyethylene glycol) acrylate (polyPEG-A) were synthesized via a "core first" methodology using a trifunctional RAFT agent, created by attaching RAFT agents to a core via their R-groups. The resultant three-armed polymeric structures were well-defined, with polydispersity indices less than 1. 2. Upon aminolysis and further reaction with dithiodipyridine (DTDP), these three-armed polymers could be tailored with sulfhydryl and pyridyldisulfide (PDS) end functionalities, available for further reaction with any free-sulfhydryl group containing precursors to form disulfide linkages. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) confirmed {{that more than}} 98 % of the polymer arms retained integral trithiocarbonate active sites after polymerization. Intradisulfide linkages between the core and the arms conferred biodegradability on the <b>star</b> <b>architectures.</b> Subsequently, the arm-termini were attached to cholesterol also via disulfide linkages. The cholesterol terminated arms were then used to form supramolecular structures via inclusion complex formation with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD). The <b>star</b> <b>architectures</b> were found to degrade rapidly on treatment with DL-dithiothereitol (DTT). The star polymers and supramolecular structures were characterized using gel permation chromatography (GPC), static light scattering (SLS), 2 D NMR, and fluorescence spectroscopy...|$|R

50|$|SIS is {{controlled}} by an authority composed of representatives of the member nations. Personal data protection is a key responsibility. At a technical level, the participating countries adopted a data-processing <b>star</b> <b>architecture</b> {{made up of a}} central site containing the reference database, known as C-SIS, for which the responsibility is entrusted to the French Republic by the CAAS, and a site by country, known as N-SIS, containing a copy of the database.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of the <b>STAR</b> <b>architecture</b> is that it requires no mechanical scanning of an antenna. Using a static antenna simplifies the antenna system dynamics and improves the time-bandwidth product of the radiometer. Furthermore, aperture thinning reduces the overall volume and mass of the antenna system. A disadvantage is the reduction of radiometric sensitivity (or increase in rms noise) of the image due to a decrease in signal-to-noise ratio for each measurement compared to a filled aperture. Pixel averaging is required for good radiometric sensitivity.|$|E

50|$|In 1974 CDC {{introduced}} the <b>STAR</b> <b>architecture.</b> The STAR was {{an entirely new}} 64-bit design with virtual memory and vector processing instructions added for high performance on a certain class of math tasks. The STAR's vector pipeline was a memory to memory pipe, which supported vector lengths of up to 65,536 elements. Unfortunately, the latencies of the vector pipeline were very long, so peak speed was approached only when very long vectors were used. The scalar processor was relatively slow {{in comparison to the}} CDC 7600. As such, the original STAR proved to be a great disappointment when it was released (see Amdahl's Law), however many of its problems seemed solvable. Best estimates claim that three STAR-100 systems were delivered.|$|E
50|$|In DUALLy, the {{interoperability}} {{among various}} architecture description languages is ensured via model transformation techniques. Instead {{of creating a}} point-to-point relationship among all languages, DUALLY defines the transformations among architecture description languages by passing through A0, which is a core set of architectural concepts defined as generally as possible (to potentiallyrepresent and support any kind of architectural representation) and extensible (in order to add domain specificities). In other words, A0 acts as a bridge among the different architectural languages to be related together. The <b>star</b> <b>architecture</b> of DUALLy enables an agile and easy integration of architecture description languages. The DUALLy transformation system is made {{of a series of}} model-to-model transformations that enable information migration among architecture models. These model-to-model transformations are constructed automatically by executing higher-order transformations (i.e., transformations taking other transformations as input or producing other transformations as output).|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} design credentials, the Union Carbide Building was a {{significant}} project for the office, built near the intersection of Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue, {{it was one of}} the first corporate headquarters built north of the downtown core. Said of it: [...] "While one may not agree on its historicity, one can't dismiss the fact that the Union Carbide building is unique, both structurally and aesthetically. It was engineered in such a way that its weight is supported entirely by its outside columns; uncluttered by posts, these airy interiors could be easily adapted to different needs. The builders chose to give the building an interesting mix of materials; granite, nickel and stainless steel creating a countenance full of dignity and character. Equally significant was that Union Carbide was one of north Toronto's first major corporate headquarters." [...] It was demolished in July 1999, an act lamented by the Toronto <b>Star</b> <b>architecture</b> critic, Christopher Hume.|$|E

40|$|Glycopolymers with a seven-arm <b>star</b> <b>architectures</b> {{based on}} a β-cyclodextrin core (β-CD-RAFT) were {{successfully}} prepared using reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. A bimodal molecular weight distribution was observed {{in the early stages}} of the polymerization. At monomer conversions of N-acryloyl glucose (AGA) above 10 % the polymerization proceeded according to a living behaviour and molecular weights of more than 200000 g mol− 1 were obtained. However, the resulting star polymers did not undergo well-controlled chain extension with N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAAm) and the formation of block structures in each arm was prevented. Alternatively, the arm-first technique was employed. Block copolymers based on AGA and PNIPAAm were self-assembled into micelles at a solution temperature above the lower critical solution temperature. Subsequent core-crosslinking with hexan- 1, 6 -diol diacrylate resulted in unimolecular micelles with thermoresponsive properties. Dynamic light scattering studies, surface tensiometry, and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the formation of core–shell particles...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the self-assembly of two telechelic star polymer–peptide conjugates based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) four-arm star polymers capped with oligotyrosine. The conjugates were prepared via N-carboxy anhydride-mediated ring-opening polymerization from PEO star polymer macroinitiators. Self-assembly occurs above a critical aggregation concentration determined via fluorescence probe assays. Peptide conformation was examined using circular dichroism spectroscopy. The structure of self-assembled aggregates was probed using small-angle X-ray scattering and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. In contrast to previous studies on linear telechelic PEO–oligotyrosine conjugates that show self-assembly into β-sheet fibrils, the <b>star</b> <b>architecture</b> suppresses fibril formation and micelles are generally observed instead, a small population of fibrils only being observed upon pH adjustment. Hydrogelation is also suppressed by the polymer <b>star</b> <b>architecture.</b> These peptide-functionalized star polymer solutions are cytocompatible at sufficiently low concentration.

40|$|Atom {{transfer}} {{radical polymerization}} (ATRP) has been chosen as ‘‘living’’/controlled free radical polymerization system to synthesize {{a number of}} novel poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) architectures. The reaction conditions for the synthesis of linear samples with control over molar mass and molar mass distribution have been investigated together {{with the possibility of}} obtaining copolymers of acrylonitrile with small quantities of methyl acrylate (max. 5 mol-%). Well-defined star polymers with 3, 4 and 6 arms have been successfully synthesized together with linear chains initiated by a bifunctional initiator and star-branched polymers with a hyperbranched poly(ester amide) as core. Molar masses were determined by NMR and GPC with the latter leading to a significant over estimation. Solution viscosity studies indicated that the stiff structure of the PAN chains is still maintained in the homopolymer <b>star</b> <b>architectures</b> and that the incorporation of small quantities of methyl acrylate as comonomer has a stronger effect on chain flexibility than the incorporation of star-branch points. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} the distributed synthesis problem for temporal logic specifications. Traditionally, {{the problem has}} been studied for LTL, and the previous results show that the problem is decidable iff there is no information fork in the architecture. We {{consider the}} problem for fragments of LTL and our main results are as follows: (1) We show that the problem is undecidable for architectures with information forks even for the fragment of LTL with temporal operators restricted to next and eventually. (2) For specifications restricted to globally along with non-nested next operators, we establish decidability (in EXPSPACE) for <b>star</b> <b>architectures</b> where the processes receive disjoint inputs, whereas we establish undecidability for architectures containing an information fork-meet structure. (3) Finally, we consider LTL without the next operator, and establish decidability (NEXPTIME-complete) for all architectures for a fragment that consists of a set of safety assumptions, and a set of guarantees where each guarantee is a safety, reachability, or liveness condition.
