40|$|The screening, biomass {{production}} of lipase-producing microorganisms from several sources, {{as well as}} the purification, characterization and utilization of the enzymatic extracts for the interesterification of butter fat were investigated. Pseudomonas fragi CRDA 323 and Aspergillus niger CBS 131. 52 were considered to be good lipase producers, whereas, those from Pseudomonas putida ATCC 795 and Rhizopus oryzae ATCC 34612 as weak ones; all four microorganisms produced maximal amount of extracellular lipases by batch fermentation after three-four days of incubation in a continuously stirred tank reactor. The lipases were partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and characterized with respect to pH, kinetic parameters and molecular size. The lipases from P. fragi and P. putida were optimal at pH 8. 5 and 8. 0, respectively, whereas those from A. niger and R. oryzae were optimal at pH 7. 5. The A. niger lipase had the lowest V$ sb{max}$ value $ rm(0. 51 times 10 sp 3 U min sp{- 1 });$ R. oryzae the highest $ rm (1. 86 times 10 sp 3 U min sp{- 1 }). $ The K$ sb{m}$ values for P. fragi, P. putida, A. niger and R. oryzae lipases were 0. 70, 1. 18, 0. 97 and 0. 98 mg ml$ sp{- 1 },$ respectively. Interesterification of butter fat by the partially purified enzymatic extracts in a microemulsion free co-surfactant system containing <b>sorbitol</b> <b>monostearate</b> and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate in the ratio 48 : 52 (V/V) decreased the water activity {{as well as the}} hydrolytic activity. The P. fragi lipase had the highest interesterification yield value (43 %) and the R. oryzae lipase the lowest (4 %). In addition, P. fragi lipase exhibited the highest decrease (18 %) in long-chain hypercholesterolemic fatty acids (C 12 : 0, C 14 : 0 and C 16 : 0) at the sn- 2 -position; the P. putida lipase demonstrated the least favorable changes in specificity at the same position. Continuous cultivation technique was developed to investigate the screening for lipase-producing microorganisms from four commercia...|$|E
40|$|The interesterification yield (IY) {{and changes}} in fatty acid {{positional}} distribution of selected butter fat triacylglycerols were investigated, using {{a wide range of}} commercial microbial lipases and organic solvent media. The interesterification of butter fat by lipase from Mucor miehei was carried out in hexane, hexane-chloroform, and hexane-ethyl acetate; the results showed that the addition of 30 % of either chloroform or ethyl acetate to the hexane resulted in a 23 % increase in the IY. The interesterification of butter fat in a microemulsion co-surfactant system, containing Brij 35 as surfactant and 1 -heptanol as co-surfactant, resulted in an increase in the triacylglycerols that contain C 18 : 0 at sn- 2 position, located originally at sn- 1, 3 positions, with a concomitant interchange with C 14 : 0 and C 18 : 1 at the same position. The interesterification of butter fat by lipase from Rhizopus niveus, in a phosphatidylcholine reverse micellar system, showed an increase in C 16 : 0 at the sn- 2 position, with a concomitant decrease in the proportion of small chain fatty acids (C 4 -C 10 : 0); however, the interesterification of butter fat in co-surfactant free microemulsion systems, containing hexane and ionic (phosphatidylcholine) and non-ionic (<b>sorbitol</b> <b>monostearate</b> and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate) surfactants, showed that the interesterified selected triacylglycerols were enriched with C 18 : 0 and C 18 : 1, originally located on sn- 1, 3 position, at sn- 2 position with concomitant interchange with C 12 : 0, C 14 : 0 and C 16 : 0, originally located at the same position. The interesterification of butter fats, in co-surfactant free microemulsion system, by four microbial lipases showed that those catalyzed by lipase from R. niveus demonstrated a 46 % increase in the proportion of C 18 : 1 at sn- 2 position whereas those catalyzed by enzymes from M. javanicus, R. delemar and M. miehei were enriched with C 16 : 0 at the same position, by 21 %, 35 % and 41 %, respectively.
