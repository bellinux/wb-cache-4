5|$|In the 1990s, the queercore {{movement}} developed {{around a}} number of punk bands with gay, lesbian, bisexual, or genderqueer members such as God Is My Co-Pilot, Pansy Division, Team Dresch, and Sister George. Inspired by openly gay punk musicians of an earlier generation such as Jayne County, Phranc, and Randy Turner, and bands like Nervous Gender, the Screamers, and Coil, queercore embraces a variety of punk and other alternative music styles. Queercore lyrics often treat the themes of prejudice, <b>sexual</b> <b>identity,</b> gender identity, and individual rights. The movement has continued into the 21st century, supported by festivals such as Queeruption.|$|E

Data responses were obtained from Grade 5 learners within 5 primary schools in the Western Cape and the data collection strategies included questionnaires, focus group discussions, individual interviews and unobtrusive observations. The findings suggest that Grade 5 learners construct their <b>sexual</b> <b>identities</b> through different and differing influences within complex discursive spaces. These influences, embedded in predominantly heterosexual discourses, seem to perpetuate a distinct behavioural trend which masculinise and feminise students' <b>sexual</b> <b>identities</b> in particular ways that work to reinscribe the dominant discourse and its concomitant social practices...|$|R

5|$|Chad is {{a member}} of the Crane family. The illegitimate son of the evil patriarch Alistair Crane, Chad is {{introduced}} as a music producer from Los Angeles who is searching for his biological family. Chad becomes involved in a love triangle with sisters Whitney and Simone Russell. His romance with Whitney is complicated by the possibility they may be engaging in an incestuous relationship as Chad is initially believed to be her half-brother, and later revealed to be her adoptive cousin. Chad's later storylines focus on his confusion over his <b>sexual</b> <b>identity,</b> and his sexual relationship with tabloid reporter Vincent Clarkson. Chad attempts to reconcile with Whitney, after his affair with Vincent is revealed, before being killed by his father Alistair while trying to protect his best friend, Ethan Winthrop.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{response}} to Chad was mixed; some reviewers praised the sensationalism of the incest storyline with Whitney, while others criticized {{his relationship with}} Vincent as an irresponsible and problematic representation of racial and <b>sexual</b> <b>identity.</b> The character marks a notable step in daytime television and soap opera history; {{it was the first}} depiction in a soap opera of two men having sex. Chad has also been cited as expanding the representation of LGBT characters of color on daytime television. Divins discussed the storyline with his gay friends and researched LGBT culture to better shape his performance.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 68 - 71). A woman {{becoming aware}} of her lesbian <b>sexual</b> <b>identities</b> is not an instantaneous event. There {{are a number of}} factors that affect the development of lesbian <b>sexual</b> <b>identities.</b> One factor focused on in this study is that of the Internet, and more specifically online dating websites. Using a poststructuralist perspective in correlation with Queer Theory, this research project examines the various communicative strategies used by lesbians who have sought a romantic partner online. Together, these strategies explore the processes lesbians experience when developing both their online and offline <b>sexual</b> <b>identities.</b> Through data gathered from interviews with lesbian online daters and reflections of my own online dating experiences, this research uncovers three key processes of the development of lesbian identities: (a) conceiving, (b) validating, (c) authenticating. This research supports the concept that identities are socially constructed and constantly develop and evolve. Ultimately, this research calls for the understanding of how the Internet affects the lesbian <b>sexual</b> <b>identities</b> development process, while exploring ways in which lesbian online daters communicate, manage, and develop their lesbian identities...|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{male and female}} sex and gender roles in a native Hawaiian context, {{focusing}} particularly on lesbians. The article's point of departure {{is that it is}} the individual who decides the norms and rules of his/her sexual and social behaviour, implying an inequadecy with models where the focus is on different "cultural" and "social" forms for modelling such behaviour. One important aspect, often neglected in studies dealing with such questions, connects to the way people actually feel and how this is practised on a life basis. Focusing on varieties in sex and gender role modelling, separating social roles and <b>sexual</b> <b>identities,</b> and allowing people to appear in the context that they live in, makes it possible to explore their ideas concerning <b>sexual</b> <b>identities</b> and social roles. In addition, this perspective also allows for an understanding of the connection people make between sexual and social behaviour more generally. Against this background, the article discusses questions concerning the present use of the concept of homosexuality among intellectuals and scientists. The material from Big Island, Hawaii implies that ideas about <b>sexual</b> <b>identities</b> and social roles are rooted in beliefs building on assumptions that people who live together/have sex with one another, take on different <b>sexual</b> <b>identities</b> and social roles, regardeless of biological sex...|$|R

5|$|Robinson {{is widely}} {{known for being}} the first priest in an openly gay {{relationship}} to be consecrated a bishop in a major Christian denomination believing in the historic episcopate. His sexual orientation was privately acknowledged in the 1970s, when he studied in seminary, was ordained, married, and started a family. He went public with his <b>sexual</b> <b>identity</b> and divorced in 1986. He entered a formal relationship with his second partner, Mark Andrew, in 1988. When delegates to the Episcopal convention were voting on the ratification of his election, it became an issue of controversy. His election was ratified 62 to 45. After his election, many theologically conservative Episcopalians in the United States abandoned the Episcopal Church, formed the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) and aligned themselves with bishops outside the Episcopal Church in the United States, a process called the Anglican realignment. His story has appeared in print and film.|$|E

40|$|Two studies {{examined}} the communication of <b>sexual</b> <b>identities</b> in a self-presentational context. The {{results from the}} first study suggest that people explicitly hold the general perception that expressing particular sexual beliefs/attitudes may actually represent a means to convey a favorable (or unfavorable) sexual identity-image to others. With the second study {{the aim was to}} examine how people may share information concerning their <b>sexual</b> <b>identities</b> to communicate a desirable impression to others and how accountability concerns may serve to impact such self-presentational efforts. Following prior research, high and low accountability conditions were manipulated with the use of an expected interaction with either a friend or a stranger. The findings indicated that in a self-presentational situation people conveyed a more moderately reserved sexual identity-image when they expected to interact with a stranger (i. e., low accountability) compared to a friend (i. e., high accountability). Conversely, in a non self-presentational situation sexual identity-images did not differ as a function of accountability conditions. Moreover, people 2 Ì† 7 s accountability concerns mediated the influence of the self-presentation x accountability interaction on <b>sexual</b> <b>identities.</b> These findings extend the literature on self-presentation, providing a more nuanced view of the qualities of people 2 Ì† 7 s self-presentation efforts, and {{to the best of our}} knowledge are the first to illustrate how people may convey their <b>sexual</b> <b>identities</b> for self-presentational purposes. ...|$|R
5|$|Women in {{homosexual}} relationships {{responded to}} this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in Europe and the United States. Following World War II, {{during a period of}} social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other. Greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families. With second wave feminism and growth of scholarship in women's history and sexuality in the 20th century, the definition of lesbian broadened, sparking a debate about sexual desire as the major component to define what a lesbian is. Some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well, while other women's self-identification as lesbian may not align with their sexual orientation or sexual behavior; <b>sexual</b> <b>identity</b> is not necessarily the same as one's sexual orientation or sexual behavior, due to various reasons, such as the fear of identifying their sexual orientation in a homophobic setting.|$|E
