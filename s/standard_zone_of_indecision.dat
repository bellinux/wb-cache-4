40|$|The Bottrop Formation {{is defined}} lithostratigraphically in {{relation}} to the underlying Upper Cretaceous Haltern Formation and the overlying Tertiary Walsum Beds. It comprises glauconitic sandy marstones and clay marlstones. At the base there are medium- to fine-grained sandy beds containing quartz and phosphorite pebble-beds, which reduce generally in thickness from west to east. Above these basal conglomerates appear glauconite nodule layers. At the top of the Bottrop Formation there is a conspicuous glauconite-rich condensation horizon containing belemnites. The biostratigraphical zonation is based on the boreal <b>standard</b> <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> northern Germany, and those of central and northwest Münsterland. The stratigraphical ranges of the ammonites are discussed {{in the context of this}} zonal framework. The ammonite fauna comprises 13 taxa.

The unique anatomy {{and structure of the}} RV limit 2 D analysis, and its regional function has not been studied yet. We show the contribution of regional 3 D deformation analysis for the study of RV remodelling in patients with PH, as compared to healthy controls. Methods: 3 D RV echocardiographic sequences were prospectively obtained from 32 patients with PH (57 ± 21 y, 15 male) and 10 healthy controls (38 ± 13 y, 6 male). Myocardial tracking was performed by semi-automatic Tomtec 4 D RV-Function 2. 0 software. Volumes and EF were directly obtained from the software. Output RV meshes were post-processed to extract local deformation (area strain) and radial/circumferential/longitudinal displacement. Data were temporally realigned to allow inter-subject pattern comparison. Spatial correspondences were obtained from the software, and allowed statistical computation in 8 <b>standard</b> <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> the RV. Results: 19 patients (59 %) were NYHA class III-IV at baseline. Over a mean FU of 49 ± 41 days, 5 patients died from cardiopulmonary causes. The highest contraction was at the RV lateral and inferior levels. Regional motion and deformation and global volume patterns for patients was significantly affected at the RV anterior, lateral, inferior, and trabecular and inlet septum. The first 4 segments were significantly associated with NYHA class and survival. Global area strain >- 15 % {{was a significant predictor of}} death (HR 411 e 12 [140 – 1. 2 e 27]).

They are mainly considered as foodborne pathogens that are found in raw or undercooked poultry and serve as an important source of sporadic campylobacteriosis. The present study was aimed to determine the prevalence and the antimicrobial resistance patterns of thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. in chicken meat. A total of 176 samples of chicken meat were analyzed using PCM and BAX® system. The samples analyzed included: 56 samples of whole chicken, 27 samples of chicken breast, 33 samples of chicken thigh, 25 samples of chicken drumstick and 35 samples of chicken wings. Samples of all the fresh chicken meat sold in İstanbul were randomly purchased from different major supermarkets in their original, individual packages. Laboratory analyses to detect thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. were performed in accordance with the ISO 10272 - 1, 2006 standard (qualitative analysis). API® Campy (BioMerieux, Marcy-l’Etoile, France) was used for the confirmation of presumptive colonies. Campylobacter isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility tests by the disc diffusion method as recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory <b>Standards.</b> <b>Zones</b> <b>of</b> growth inhibition were evaluated according to the NCCLS standards. Using PCM, the prevalence of C. coli, C. jejuni and C. lari was determined as 15. 34, 8. 52 and 1. 7 %, respectively. However, using BAX® system, the prevalence was determined as 15. 90, 18. 75 and 1. 7 % for C. coli, C. jejuni and C. lari, respectively. C. coli was resistant to nalidixic acid (78. 57 %), ofloxacin (14. 29 %) norfloxacin (10. 71 %) and ampicillin (10. 71 %). But the highest resistance was observed to nalidixic acid (90. 91 %) for C. jejuni and (100 %) for C. lari.
