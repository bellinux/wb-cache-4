25|$|The word {{robotics}} {{was derived}} from the word robot, which was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), which was published in 1920. The word robot comes from the Slavic word robota, which means labour. The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called robots, creatures who can be mistaken for humans – very similar to the modern ideas of androids. Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a <b>short</b> <b>letter</b> in reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary in which he named his brother Josef Čapek as its actual originator.|$|E

25|$|Karel Čapek {{introduced}} and made popular the frequently used international word robot, which {{first appeared in}} his play R.U.R. in 1920. While it is frequently {{thought that he was}} the originator of the word, he wrote a <b>short</b> <b>letter</b> in reference to an article in the Oxford English Dictionary etymology in which he named his brother, painter and writer Josef Čapek, as its actual inventor. In an article in the Czech journal Lidové noviny in 1933, he also explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures laboři (from Latin labor, work). However, he did not like the word, seeing it as too artificial, and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested roboti (robots in English).|$|E
25|$|Various books, memoirs {{and stories}} were written about Jesus {{by the early}} Christians. The most famous are the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. All but one of these are {{believed}} to have been written within 50–70 years of the death of Jesus, with the Gospel of Mark believed to be the earliest, and the last the Gospel of John. Blainey writes that the oldest surviving record written by an early Christian is a <b>short</b> <b>letter</b> by St Paul: the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, which appeared about 25 years after the death of Jesus. This letter, while important in describing issues for the development of Gentilic Christianity, contains little of significance for understanding the life of the historic Jesus.|$|E

[...] As First Lord St Vincent intended to investigate, discover and remove all of the corruption that he considered plagued the Navy, the Royal Dockyards and their civilian administration. Consequently, he clashed with the various Navy Boards, the civil administration of the Royal Navy that administered among other things the navy yards and stores. St Vincent saw these boards and individuals as hindering {{the efforts of the}} Navy.|$|E

500|$|Leonard Woolf and E. M. Forster {{drafted a}} letter of protest against the {{suppression}} of The Well, assembling a list of supporters that included Shaw, T. S. Eliot, Arnold Bennett, Vera Brittain and Ethel Smyth. According to Virginia Woolf, the plan broke down when Hall objected to {{the wording of the}} letter, insisting it mention her book's [...] "artistic merit– even genius". The Wells sentimental romanticism, traditional form, and lofty style– using words like withal, betoken and hath– did not appeal to Modernist aesthetics; not all those willing to defend it on grounds of literary freedom were equally willing to praise its artistry. The petition dwindled to a <b>short</b> <b>letter</b> in The Nation and Athenaeum, signed by Forster and Virginia Woolf, that focused on the chilling effects of censorship on writers.|$|E
500|$|Sylvia and Adela, meanwhile, did {{not share}} their mother's enthusiasm for the war. As {{committed}} pacifists, they rejected the WSPU's support for the government. Sylvia's socialist perspective convinced her {{that the war was}} another example of capitalist oligarchs exploiting poor soldiers and workers. Adela, meanwhile, spoke against the war in Australia and made public her opposition to conscription. In a <b>short</b> <b>letter,</b> Emmeline told Sylvia: [...] "I am ashamed to know where you and Adela stand." [...] She had a similar impatience for dissent within the WSPU; when long-time member Mary Leigh asked a question during a meeting in October 1915, Pankhurst replied: [...] "hat woman is a pro German and should leave the hall.... I denounce you as a pro German and wish to forget that such a person ever existed." [...] Some WSPU members were outraged by this sudden rigid devotion to the government, the leadership's perceived abandonment of efforts to win the vote for women, and questions about how funds collected on behalf of suffrage were being managed with regard to the organisation's new focus. Two groups split from the WSPU: The Suffragettes of the Women's Social and Political Union (SWSPU) and the Independent Women's Social and Political Union (IWSPU), each dedicated to maintaining pressure toward women's suffrage.|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1845, Babbage had solved a cipher {{that had been}} posed as a {{challenge}} by his nephew Henry Hollier, and in the process, he made a discovery about ciphers that were based on Vigenère tables. [...] Specifically, he realized that enciphering plain text with a keyword rendered the cipher text subject to modular arithmetic. [...] During the Crimean War of the 1850s, Babbage broke Vigenère's autokey cipher {{as well as the}} much weaker cipher that is called Vigenère cipher today. His discovery was kept a military secret, and was not published. Credit for the result was instead given to Friedrich Kasiski, a Prussian infantry officer, who made the same discovery some years later. However, in 1854, Babbage published the solution of a Vigenère cipher, which had been published previously in the Journal of the Society of Arts. [...] In 1855, Babbage also published a <b>short</b> <b>letter,</b> [...] "Cypher Writing", in the same journal. Nevertheless, his priority wasn't established until 1985.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{committing}} {{himself to}} the Mediterranean, Decatur learned from the American consuls at Cadiz and Tangier of any squadrons passing by along the Atlantic coast or through the Strait of Gibraltar.

[...] He learned from observers there that a squadron under the command of the notorious Rais Hamidou had passed by into the Mediterranean, most likely off Cape Gata. Decatur's squadron arrived at Gibraltar on June 15, 1815. This attracted much attention and prompted the departure of several dispatch vessels to warn Hammida of the squadron's arrival. Decatur's visit was brief with the consul and lasted only {{for as long as it}} took to communicate with a <b>short</b> <b>letter</b> to the Secretary of the Navy informing him of earlier weather problems and that he was about to [...] "proceed in search of the enemy forthwith", where he at once set off in search of Hamidou hoping to take him by surprise.|$|E
