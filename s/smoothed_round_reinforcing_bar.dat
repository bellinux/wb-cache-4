Because of the poor detailing of reinforcement, the absence of capacity design philosophy {{and the use of}} plain <b>round</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars,</b> peculiar brittle failure mechanisms were observed. At the local level, most of the damage occurred in the beam-column joint panel zones, through particularly brittle failure mechanisms. At the global level, the formation of undesirable soft-stories, resulting from a combination of column hinging and exterior joint damage, greatly impaired the overall structural performance of these RC frames...|$|R

The technique proposed in this paper for detection of the closely arranged <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> makes use of stress waves.

40|$|The {{development}} of an accurate local bond stress–slip (τ–δ) relationship for steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> has been hindered for two reasons: because steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> are internally encased, {{it is difficult to}} strain gauge the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> to quantify the change in strain over a given length and, therefore, to directly measure the local τ–δ relationship; and {{because of the presence of}} yielding, which generally occurs before debonding and significantly influences the behaviour of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar.</b> To overcome these difficulties associated with quantifying the local τ–δ relationship of steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars,</b> theory developed to obtain the local τ–δ relationship from the global load slip (P–Δ) response of FRP plated reinforced concrete structures has been modified in this research to account for short embedment lengths. Furthermore, in this paper, a link between the global load–slip (P–Δ) response and the local τ–δ relationship of steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars,</b> that is independent of embedment length, is presented for the first time.
