25|$|Various {{instruments}} in Africa, {{chief among them}} the kora, feature a skin head and gourd (or similar <b>shell)</b> <b>body.</b> The African instruments differ from early African American banjos in that the necks do not possess a Western-style fingerboard and tuning pegs, instead having stick necks, with strings attached to the neck with loops for tuning. Banjos with fingerboards and tuning pegs are known from the Caribbean {{as early as the}} 17th century. 18th- and early 19th-century writers transcribed the name of these instruments variously as bangie, banza, bonjaw, banjer and banjar. Instruments similar to the banjo (e.g., the Japanese shamisen, Persian tar, and Moroccan sintir) have been played in many countries. Another likely relative of the banjo is the akonting, a spike folk lute played by the Jola tribe of Senegambia, and the ubaw-akwala of the Igbo. Similar {{instruments in}}clude the xalam of Senegal and the ngoni of the Wassoulou region including parts of Mali, Guinea, and Ivory Coast, as well as a larger variation of the ngoni developed in Morocco by sub-Saharan Africans known as the gimbri.|$|E

50|$|The 155 mm M549/M549A1 HERA is a separate-loading munition with {{a two-part}} forged <b>shell</b> <b>body.</b> The forward HE-filled <b>shell</b> <b>body</b> is {{constructed}} from high-fragmentation steel (HF1) and is of a low-drag aerodynamic profile. The rocket-motor body {{makes up the}} rear of the shell, this constructed from 4340 steel. The motor body weighs 13.5 kg (approximately 3.175 kg of which is propellant), is 266.7 mm long and is encircled by a welded overlay copper driving band and obturator band, both protected during storage and transit by a polycarbonate composition grommet. At the front of the projectile, the fuze cavity is protected during transport by an energy-absorbing lifting plug, which protects the fuze area from damage during storage, transit and handling. Before loading, the lifting plug is replaced by a fuze, and the protector cap over the rocket-motor nozzle is removed; the 155 mm M549/M549A1 HERA is not intended to be fired in the 'rocket-off' mode. On-target effects are enhanced by the shell's HF-1 steel body.The 155 mm M549 HERA forward <b>shell</b> <b>body</b> is filled with a nominal 7.26 kg of Composition B. The M549A1 HERA filler is 6.8 kg of cast TNT.At the instant of firing, the propellant gases ignite a pyrotechnic delay train in the rocket motor. The delay burns for approximately seven seconds. By the end of this seven seconds, the end of the delay train reaches the rocket's primary igniter and subsequently lights the motor's two propellant grains via an igniter pellet.|$|E

If set on Delay, the Super Quick flash igniter mechanism was immobilized to prevent premature ignition. Models: M48, M48A1, M48A2 (either 0.05 or 0.15 second Delay), & M48A3 (0.05 second delay).|$|E
50|$|The {{complete}} {{high explosive}} (HE) round {{consists of a}} fuze, the <b>shell</b> <b>body,</b> and the propellant charge assembly. The fuze is a point-detonating type, consisting of a two-piece brass body, a booster cup, a detonator holder, and a washer. The steel <b>shell</b> <b>body</b> is threaded at the top to receive the fuze assembly, and at the bottom to accommodate the propellant charge assembly. It is marked with a white band near the base, indicating {{the body of the}} shell is made of high grade steel and a red band at the nose, indicating it is filled with black powder. The propellant charge assembly consists of the percussion cap, the propellant powder, and an expanding copper rotating band. The propellant charge is ignited when the firing pin hits the percussion cap. The propellant gases expand the copper rotating band against the rifling in the interior of the barrel; the rifling causes the projectile to rotate and thus increases the accuracy of its flight. The projectile is 8.62 in long and 2.18 in inches in diameter; the complete round weighs 4 lb. The 70mm mortar was also used to launch an unusual AA mine discharger shell.|$|E
50|$|The Ritz Guitar Company {{went out}} of {{business}} due to manufacturing problems in obtaining <b>shell</b> <b>bodies</b> which resulted in Becnel and Wildes discontinuing financial support of the company, liquidating the inventory and closing the company. A company resurfaced with the cracked shell finish Neptunes and a slight design change under the name WRC Guitars, which is the initials for Wayne Richard Charvel (which also included some telecaster body designs). There are rumors that many Ritz Neptune bodies and necks are stored somewhere in a warehouse without pick-ups and necks since the company {{went out of}} business.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{ammunition}} was HE (high explosive) shells {{filled with}} Amatol, Trotyl (TNT) or Lyddite. The standard shell weight was 290 lb. However, there were 19 variants of HE shell, some with sub-variants. Later marks of shell had a fill that varied between about 25 and 40 lb of HE, and <b>shell</b> <b>bodies</b> varying in length between 28 and 32 in. There was also some use of Common Pointed shell filled with Shellite. Later fuzes included various versions of No 101, 106 and 188. More than three million {{rounds of ammunition}} were expended during the war.|$|R

50|$|The shell was a APCBC-HE-T design. It {{consisted}} of the <b>shell</b> <b>body</b> fitted with penetrating (AP) and ballistic caps (BC), an explosive filler (HE) and a tracer unit (T) that was incorporated into the base fuze. Phlegmatized PETN or RDX were commonplace as the explosive filling. Pzgr. 39 was only used in guns firing fixed ammunition. The same Pzgr. 39 shells of a certain caliber could be fitted to different cartridge cases. For example the 7.5 cm Pak 40 L/46 antitank gun and the 7.5 cm KwK 40 L/48 tank gun fired the same projectile, {{even though they had}} completely different cartridge cases.|$|E
5000|$|Later {{versions}} (designated [...] "E") incorporated {{an additional}} safety mechanism: an internal [...] "shutter", also activated by {{rotation of the}} shell after firing, which closed the channel between the striker in the nose and the powder magazine in the base until it was clear of the gun which fired it. On firing, the shutter resisted acceleration ("setback") and the accelerating <b>shell</b> <b>body</b> pushed against it, preventing the shutter from moving. When acceleration ceased shortly after the shell left the gun barrel, the shutter ceased to [...] "set back" [...] and was free to spin outwards, activating the fuze.|$|E
