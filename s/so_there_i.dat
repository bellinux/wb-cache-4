2500|$|In 1934, Kirchner visited Berne and Zurich, {{finding the}} former more {{pleasing}} than the latter, and met Paul Klee. In {{the winter of}} 1935, a new school was being planned {{to be built in}} Frauenkirch and Kirchner offered to paint a mural. This project was dropped and instead Kirchner created a sculpture to be placed above the door of the schoolhouse. Reflecting on the inauguration of the schoolhouse in 1936 he writes, [...] "the new school was inaugurated yesterday. It was a celebration with songs, dancing and speeches, followed by drinking such as I have not seen or experienced in decades...They made a point of including me and <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> was, sitting once again amongst these people who had received me with such kindness and friendliness on the alp twenty years ago. The relief has found favour and was mentioned often in the speeches".|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, you may abuse me as you please," [...] {{said the}} good-natured old lady, [...] "you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back again. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> have the whip hand of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That Tim Goddard stole all my clothes, and no good may they do him; {{last time}} as I went to gaol I gave them him to kep, {{and he went}} off for a navvy meantime; <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> am.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only wish}} I was! I made {{the biggest mistake}} of my life when <b>I</b> ran away, <b>so</b> <b>there!</b> and <b>I</b> don't care who knows it!" [...] And Fred threw himself {{on a bench in}} front of the tent.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is, you oughtn't to {{have allowed}} {{yourself}} to do <b>so.</b> Well, <b>there</b> <b>I</b> agree with you. But a woman may {{do so without}} impertinence, and I am sure that Miss Kenton has a story. I have watched her, and her face has told me everything but the story." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>there</b> was <b>I,</b> {{left alone}} in my glory at Falesá; and when the {{schooner}} came round I filled her up, {{and gave her a}} deck-cargo half as high as the house. I must say Mr. Tarleton did the right thing by us; but he took a meanish kind of a revenge.|$|R
6000|$|<b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> lay, debating what to do-- [...] What {{measures}} might most usefully {{be taken}} [...] To circumvent the subterranean crew [...] Of anthropophagi and save my bacon. [...] My fortitude {{was all this}} while unshaken, [...] But any gentleman, of course, protests [...] Against receiving uninvited guests.|$|E
6000|$|... "Freebooters, {{after the}} fashion of our own Quatre fils Aymon," [...] {{answered}} Gaston, composedly. [...] "Yes, Beranger d'Albricorte was the terror of all around, and little was the chance that aught would pursue him to his den. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> grew up, as well beseemed the cub of such a wolf, racing through the old halls at my will." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought of}} trying to follow them, but the soft and gentle hand, which was like {{to that of a}} woman, once more clasped mine and held me where I was, {{suffering}} me to move no single inch. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> stood, even after the hand had loosed me again, for {{it seemed to me that}} there was something most strange in this business.|$|E
6000|$|... "No! is that so? I {{never see}} you in the big reception-room. <b>I</b> go in <b>there</b> {{a good deal of the}} time, because <b>there's</b> <b>so</b> many Americans <b>there.</b> <b>I</b> make lots of acquaintances. You been up the Rigi yet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was <b>so</b> dismal <b>there</b> that <b>I</b> left! I am {{staying out}} this way." [...] She pointed in a {{contrary}} direction, {{the direction in}} which he was journeying.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Doctor John--I shudder at {{the thought}} of being liable to such an illusion! It seemed <b>so</b> real. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> no cure?--no preventive?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To a {{place that}} Dingaan gave him just outside his kraal. The king {{said that he would}} be useful to him, as he could mend guns and teach his {{soldiers}} to shoot with them. <b>So</b> <b>there,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, he remains, unless he has thought it wiser to make off. At any rate, I am sure that he will not come here to trouble you or anyone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't. I hate you, and if {{you don't}} clear out I'll call father. You're one o' these kind o' men that think if a girl looks at 'em {{that they want to}} marry 'em. I tell you I don't want {{anything}} more to do with you, and I'm engaged to another man, and I wish you'd attend to your own business. <b>So</b> <b>there!</b> <b>I</b> hope you're satisfied." ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{had come}} to know that Kari never did {{anything}} without a reason and remembered that I was in a strange country where, lacking him, I should not have lived or could continue to do so, I fell into his humour. Moreover, I promised that I would remain still and neither speak, nor smile, nor rise from my chair unless he bade me. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> sat glittering in the hot sunshine which burned me through the armour.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's quick-tempered, is Emma," [...] ses Mrs. Jennings. [...] "But, <b>there,</b> <b>so</b> am <b>I.</b> Wot {{you might}} call a generous temper, but quick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Could not understand?" [...] {{repeated}} Toolooha, with an incredulous look, [...] "let not Chingatok say <b>so.</b> <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> {{anything that}} passes {{the lips of}} man which he cannot understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I {{possibly}} know anything <b>so</b> strange? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> one day {{out of the}} seven when he is otherwise than on the other six?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> lay a long time, unable even {{to get out}} of the snow, {{and with}} every {{movement}} causing me a horrid pain in my injured back. Still, I kept on moving my legs every now and then to make the pain shoot, and so prevent myself from feeling drowsy. The snow half suffocated me, and I could only breathe with difficulty. At last, slowly, I began to lose consciousness, and presently I suppose I fell asleep. To fall asleep in the snow is the first stage of freezing to death.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd {{thought that}} I'd {{naturally}} have chuckled mightily at giving Mr. Towser the slip so neatly; but it's {{a fact that}} I felt really ashamed, for it did seem ridiculous {{that one of my}} family would fall into a hole while running. Where was I? Well, if you'll believe it, I'd struck Grandfather Fox's hole, and he wasn't at home on account of having his hide nailed up on Mr. Man's barn, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> was all by my lonesome, with Mr. Towser scratching gravel at a great rate; but I knew he could wear his claws way down to the flesh before getting in, for Grandfather Fox knew how to dig a house that would protect him from dogs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here I lived {{very well}} for some months; my master was very good and kind to me; but, unluckily, too poor to give me any wages; so that I could save nothing to send to my poor mother. My {{mistress}} used to scold; but I was used to that at home, from Aunt Bridget: and she beat me sometimes, but I did not mind it; for your hardy country girl is not like your tender town lasses, who cry if a pin pricks them, and give warning to their mistresses at the first hard word. The only drawback to my comfort was, that I had no news of my mother; I could not write to her, nor could she have read my letter, if I had; <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> was, at only six leagues' distance from home, as far off as if I had been to Paris or to 'Merica.|$|E
6000|$|... “No, {{they just}} {{stood by the}} back fence talkin’. I thought they had somethin’ {{to do with that}} new buildin’ going up <b>there,</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> didn’t think nuthin’ more about it.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Voluntary {{surrender}} and extradition of Malnar's {{generals and}} ministers to the Hague and ICTY ("You go <b>there,</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> don't have to go."), a parody {{on the same}} events from reality.|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{a million}} snakes up <b>there,</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> once heard," [...] put in Whopper. [...] "Snakes are so thick {{you have to}} kick 'em {{out of your way}} to walk around." ...|$|R
60|$|July 7.--This morning {{corrected}} proofs, {{with which}} J.B. proceeds lazily enough, and alleges printing reasons, {{of which he}} has plenty at hand. Though it was the Teind Wednesday the devil would have it {{that this was a}} Court of Session day also for a cause of mine; <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> sat hearing a dozen cases of augmentation of stipend pleaded, and wondering within myself whether anything can be predicated of a Scottish parish, in which there cannot be discovered a reason for enlarging the endowments of the minister. I returned after two, with a sousing shower for companion; I got very wet and very warm. But shall we go mourn for that, my dear?[394] I rather like a flaw of weather; it shows something of the old man is left. I had Mr. Buchanan to help pack my papers and things, and got through part of that unpleasant business.|$|E
6000|$|<b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> {{must leave}} this matter, though {{for my part}} I was sure that Kari was not mad, {{whatever}} {{he might have been}} in the past. A great dreamer he was, it is true, who declared that the poison which his brother had given him had [...] "eaten a hole in his mind" [...] through which he could see and hear things which others could not. Thus he was able to read the secret motives of men and women with wonderful clearness, so much so that sometimes I asked him, laughing, if he could not give me some of that poison that I might see into the hearts of those with whom I dealt. Of another thing, too, he was always certain, namely, that he would return to his country Tavantinsuyu of which he thought day and night, and that I should accompany him. At this I laughed again and said that if so it would be after we were both dead.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Even so, my son, even <b>so.</b> <b>There</b> <b>I</b> saw {{the world}} which thou wouldst see. And what saw I? Even what thou wilt see. Eunuchs the tyrants of their own sovereigns. Bishops kissing the feet of parricides and harlots. Saints tearing saints in pieces for a word, while sinners cheer them on to the unnatural fight. Liars thanked for lying, hypocrites taking pride in their hypocrisy. The many sold and butchered for the malice, the caprice, the vanity of the few. The plunderers of the poor plundered in their turn by worse devourers than themselves. Every attempt at reform the parent of worse scandals; every mercy begetting fresh cruelties; every persecutor silenced, only to enable others to persecute him in their turn: every devil who is exorcised, {{returning}} with seven others worsethan himself; falsehood and selfishness, spite and lust, confusion seven times confounded, Satan casting out Satan everywhere--from the emperor who wantons on his throne, to the slave who blasphemes beneath his fetters.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Upon my word I think I'll do it,' {{said the}} captain. 'It {{would be of}} the {{greatest}} possible service to you as {{an officer of the}} Crown. It would give you <b>so</b> much weight <b>there.</b> <b>I</b> could make you known, you know----' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! Still. That it is a {{great work}} to have cut you away from father's life, and to have made a new and good beginning. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> am <b>I,</b> Charley, left alone with father, keeping him as {{straight}} as I can, watching for more influence than I have, and hoping that through some fortunate chance, or when he is ill, or when--I don't know what--I may turn him to wish to do better things.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I never a friend, {{who have}} befriended <b>so</b> many? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> no man in Blossholme who will avenge me of this brute Ambrose? Aye, I see some." ...|$|R
60|$|Beyond the boulevard, {{forth to}} the open country, lay a wide plain, and behind it, closing it in, a long, low wall of steep hills. On the left, {{a mile and a}} half away, Father Francois showed me the church tower of Venette, where the English camped; to the right, a league off, was the tower of Clairoix; and at the end of a long raised {{causeway}} that ran from the bridge across the plain, because of the winter floods, I saw the tower and the village of Margny. All these towns and spires looked peaceful, but all were held by the Burgundians. Men-at-arms were thick on the crest of our boulevard, and on the gate-keep, all looking across the river towards the town, whence the Maid should sally by way of the bridge. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> lay on a couch in the window and waited, having no fear, but great joy.|$|E
60|$|I really cannot express how uneasy {{this made}} me. If {{he would only}} have brushed up his hair or turned up his collar, {{it would have been}} bad enough; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing at me, and always in that demonstrative state of despondency, put such a {{constraint}} upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play, or to cry at it, or to move, or to speak. I seemed able to do nothing naturally. As to escaping Mr. Guppy by going {{to the back of the}} box, I could not bear to do that because I knew Richard and Ada relied on having me next them and that they could never have talked together so happily if anybody else had been in my place. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> sat, not knowing where to look--for wherever I looked, I knew Mr. Guppy's eyes were following me--and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this young man was putting himself on my account.|$|E
6000|$|... "However, I {{came up to}} him by {{the time}} the stars were fairly out. As it got darker I began to see all manner of glowing things in the water-- phosphorescence, you know. At times it made me giddy. I hardly knew which was stars and which was phosphorescence, and whether I was {{swimming}} on my head or my heels. The canoe was as black as sin, and the ripple under the bows like liquid fire. I was naturally chary of clambering up into it. I was anxious to see {{what he was up to}} first. He seemed to be lying cuddled up in a lump in the bows, and the stern was all out of water. The thing kept turning round slowly as it drifted---kind of waltzing, don't you know. I went to the stern and pulled it down, expecting him to wake up. Then I began to clamber in with my knife in my hand, and ready for a rush. But he never stirred. <b>So</b> <b>there</b> <b>I</b> sat in the stern of the little canoe, drifting away over the calm phosphorescent sea, and with all the host of the stars above me, waiting for something to happen.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, I remember! But you're out now, aren't you? I've {{been out}} since this spring. Mother won't let us come out till we are eighteen, isn't it horrid? And we were <b>so</b> worked <b>there!</b> <b>I</b> {{can tell you}} a {{finishing}} governess is an awful institution! Poor little Rosie and Adey will be in for one by and by. At present they've only got a jolly little Fraulein {{that they can do}} anything they please with.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, by Jove! we fellows {{will have}} to look out or you'll carry off all the honours. You were superb today, and held us all like magic, though it was <b>so</b> hot <b>there,</b> <b>I</b> really think I couldn't have stood it for anyone else,' added Dolly, labouring to be gallant and really {{offering}} a touching proof of devotion; for the heat melted his collar, took the curl out of his hair, and ruined his gloves.|$|R
50|$|I felt incensed by Martin Creed's light {{going on}} and off in Tate Britain, {{but was unable to}} do a satirical {{painting}} of it because there was nothing <b>there,</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> did this one instead.|$|R
