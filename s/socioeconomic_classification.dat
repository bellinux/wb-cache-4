40|$|BACKGROUND: Sleep {{problems}} {{affect people}} of all ages, race, gender, and <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>classifications.</b> Undiagnosed sleep disorders significantly and adversely impact a person’s level of academic achievement, job performance, and subsequently, socioeconomic status. Undiagnosed sleep disorders also negatively impact both direct and indirect costs for employers, the national government, and the general public. Sleepiness has significant implications on quality of life by impacting occupational performance, driving ability, cognition, memory, and overall health. The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe the prevalence of daytime sleepiness, as well as other quantitative predictors of sleep continuity and quality. METHODS: Population data from the CDC program in fatigue surveillance were used for this secondary analysis seeking to characterize sleep quality and continuity variables. Each participant underwent a standard nocturnal polysomnography and a standard multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) on the subsequent day. Frequency and chi-square tests were used to describe the sample. One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to compare sleep related variables of groups with sleep latencies of 10 minutes. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association of the sleep variables with sleep latency time...|$|R
40|$|Several social {{indicators}} {{have been}} used in epidemiological research to describe socioeconomic position (SEP) of people in societies. Among SEP indicators, those more frequently used are education, occupational class and income. Differences in the incidence of several health outcomes have been reported consistently, independently from the indicator employed. Main objectives of the study were to present the <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>classifications</b> of the social indicators which will be employed throughout the LIFEPATH project and to compare social gradients in all-cause mortality observed in the participating adult cohorts using the different SEP indicators. Information on the available social indicators (education, own and father's occupational class, income) from eleven adult cohorts participating in LIFEPATH was collected and harmonized. Mortality by SEP for each indicator was estimated by Poisson regression on each cohort and then evaluated using a meta-analytical approach. In the meta-analysis, among men mortality was significantly inversely associated with both occupational class and education, but not with father's occupational class; among women, the increase in mortality in lower social strata was smaller than among men and, except for a slight increase in the lowest education category, no significant differences were found. Among men, the proposed three-level classifications of occupational class and education were found to predict differences in mortality which is consistent with previous research. Results on women suggest that classifying them through their sole SEP, without considering that of their partners, may imply a misclassification of their social position leading to attenuation of mortality differences...|$|R
30|$|Aiming at the anti-poverty {{outline of}} China and the human–environment {{sustainable}} development, we propose a multidimensional poverty measure and analysis methodology {{for measuring the}} poverty-stricken counties and their contributing factors. We build a set of multidimensional poverty indicators with Chinese characteristics, integrating A–F double cutoffs, dimensional aggregation and decomposition approach, and GIS spatial analysis to evaluate the poor’s multidimensional poverty characteristics under different geographic and socioeconomic conditions. The case study from 11 counties of Hechi City shows that, firstly, each county existed at least four respects of poverty, and overall the poverty level showed the spatial pattern of surrounding higher versus middle lower. Secondly, three main poverty contributing factors were unsafe housing, family health and adults’ illiteracy, while the secondary factors include fuel type and children enrollment rate, etc., generally demonstrating strong autocorrelation; in terms of poverty degree, the western of the research area shows a significant aggregation effect, whereas the central and the eastern represent significant spatial heterogeneous distribution. Thirdly, under three kinds of <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>classifications,</b> the intra-classification diversities of H, A, and MPI are greater than their inter-classification ones, while {{each of the three}} indexes has a positive correlation with both the rocky desertification degree and topographic fragmentation degree, respectively. This study could help policymakers better understand the local poverty by identifying the poor, locating them and describing their characteristics, so as to take differentiated poverty alleviation measures according to specific conditions of each county.|$|R

There are few population-based studies that have examined use rates of varenicline and other stop smoking medications. We report data from the ITC Four Country survey conducted with smokers in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia who reported an attempt to quit smoking in past year in the 2006 survey (n = 4, 022 participants), 2007 (n = 3, 790 participants), and 2008 surveys (n = 2, 735 participants) Respondents reported use of various stop smoking medications to quit smoking at each survey wave, along with demographic and smoker characteristics. The self-reported use of any stop smoking medication has increased significantly over the 3 year period in all 4 countries, with the sharpest increase occurring in the United States. Varenicline has become the second most used stop smoking medication, behind NRT, in all 4 countries since being introduced. Between 2006 and 2008, varenicline use rates increased from 0. 4 % to 21. 7 % in the US, 0. 0 % to 14. 8 % in Canada, 0. 0 % to 14. 5 % in Australia, and 0. 0 % to 4. 4 % in the UK. In contrast, use of NRT and bupropion remained constant in each country. Males and non-whites were {{significantly less likely to}} report using any SSM, while more educated smokers {{were significantly more likely to}} use any SSM, including varenicline. Our findings suggest that the introduction of varenicline led to an increase in the number of smokers who used evidence-based treatment during their quit attempts, rather than simply gaining market share at the expense of other medications. From a public health perspective, messages regarding increased success rates among medication users and the relative safety of stop smoking medications should be disseminated widely so as to reach all smokers of all <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>classifications</b> equally...|$|R

40|$|Background An obesity {{epidemic}} is spreading worldwide. {{in addition to}} comorbidities, social and emotional problems contribute to reduce {{the quality of life}} (QoL) of obese people. Considering the heterogeneity of outcomes from clinical and surgical approaches, it is recommended that severely obese patients participate in their treatment decisions. This study evaluated preferences of severely obese patients for obesity surgical treatment using the willingness to pay (WTP) and {{to assess the impact of}} the presence of some clinical disorders, socioeconomic conditions and QoL on their decisions. Methods the selected patients were invited to answer the WTP questionnaire using two formats of contingent valuation questions: dichotomous choice (yes/no) and a bidding game. the answers were correlated with clinical features, QoL assessed by the SF- 36 and the Moorehead-Ardelt Quality of Life Questionnaire II, Brazilian <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>classification,</b> and family and personal incomes. Results the group of patients who accepted the first bid was older and had higher frequency of sleep apnoea when compared to those who rejected the offer. A significant correlation between the bidding game value and family income was found (r= 0. 28; P< 0. 02). in the logistic regression model, <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>classification</b> and sleep apnoea were shown to be independently associated with acceptance the bid. Conclusions Sleep apnoea was the comorbidity that most influenced the acceptance in dichotomous choice for bariatric surgery, probably due to the deleterious effects on daily activities induced by sleep disturbances. Our findings also suggest that the frequency of surgical procedures is below the preference of the obese population in Brazil.

40|$|Although special {{education}} classifications have been frequently divided into "subjective " and "objective " categories of disability, the dominant paradigm sees {{the two types}} of classifications as occu-pying opposite ends of a continuum that ranges from mild learning impairment to severe physical and mental disability.

Multiple regression anal-yses using aggregates of social variables as predictors were con-ducted for classifications that were significantly related to social variables. None of the objective classifications could be related to social structure, but two subjective classifications, educable mental retardation and learning disabilities, were strongly and inversely associated with <b>socioeconomic</b> indicators.

Secondly, to examine the relation between disease patterns and available occupational data in male subjects of working age. DESIGN: A census survey of all cases occurring in the three counties in the Western Health Board (WHB) area, Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, for the 11 year period 1980 to 1990 inclusive. Average annual age standardised incidence rates for the period were calculated using the 1986 census data. Rates for the area are compared with rates from the southern region of Ireland, which had a tumour registry. Trends over the time period are evaluated. All male subjects for whom occupational data were available were categorised using the Irish <b>socioeconomic</b> group <b>classification</b> and incidence rates by occupation were compared using the standardised incidence ratio method. In one of the counties, Galway, a detailed occupational history of selected cases and an age matched control group was also elicited through patients' general practitioners. SETTING: All available case records in the West of Ireland. RESULTS: There are no national incidence records for the period. Compared with data from the Southern Tumour Registry, {{the number of cases}} of women with myeloid leukaemias was significantly lower. Male leukaemia rates were significantly lower as a group (SIR 84 (95 % CI 74, 95) but not when considered as individual categories.

There were also significantly increased incidence ratios for both non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR 169, 95 % CI 124, 266) and three categories of leukaemias among farmers. Hodgkin's disease and acute myeloid leukaemias were significantly increased among semi-skilled people. Interview data with 90 cases and 54 controls of both sexes revealed that among farmers, cases (n = 31) were significantly less likely than controls (n = 20) to use tractor mounted spraying techniques (OR = 0. 19 (95 % CI 0. 04, 0. 80)) and less likely to wear protective masks (OR 0. 22 (95 % CI 0. 05, 0. 84)).

40|$|This {{occasional}} paper {{is the first}} in a series on the National Quality Framework (NQF). This paper offers detailed insights into education and care service quality ratings for Quality Area 1 – Educational Program and Practice, which focuses on ensuring that educational program and practice is stimulating and engaging, enhances children’s learning and development, and meets children’s individual learning and development needs. ACECQA has chosen to focus this first {{occasional paper}} on Quality Area 1 because of its vital contribution to child outcomes and because the evidence indicates that services are less likely to meet the National Quality Standard (NQS) in this Area. Additionally, the paper is timely given ACECQA’s work in period 2014 / 15 with Regulatory Authorities and Professional Support Coordinators to deliver national workshops to educators to help them better understand and meet the requirements of Quality Area 1. The paper provides a brief overview of the NQS, its rating system, quality areas and overall ratings to date. It then examines Quality Area 1 looking at differences across jurisdictions, management types, service sub-types, and <b>socioeconomic</b> and remoteness <b>classifications.</b> Of particular interest are elements 1. 2. 1 and 1. 2. 3, which analysis reveals are the least likely of all the 58 elements to be assessed as met. Here, the discussion includes de-identified excerpts from authorised officers’ reports to highlight what can differentiate performance against these elements. The paper culminates by examining patterns in the distribution of Quality Area 1 ratings and discusses possible explanations for these variations, as well as implications of the report findings and future directions. The paper is intended to be of interest to people who deliver education and care services, people who provide training and professional development services to the sector, and to officers in the Regulatory Authorities that conduct quality rating.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{the wide}} {{availability}} of prenatal screening and diagnosis, {{a number of}} studies have reported no decrease in the rate of babies born with Down syndrome. The objective of this study was to investigate the geodemographic characteristics of women who have prenatal diagnosis in Victoria, Australia, by applying a novel consumer behaviour modelling technique in the analysis of health data. Methods A descriptive analysis of data on all prenatal diagnostic tests, births (1998 and 2002) and births of babies with Down syndrome (1998 to 2002) was undertaken using a Geographic Information System and <b>socioeconomic</b> lifestyle segmentation <b>classifications.</b> Results Most metropolitan women in Victoria have average or above State average levels of uptake of prenatal diagnosis. Inner city women residing in high socioeconomic lifestyle segments who have high rates of prenatal diagnosis spend 20 % more on specialist physician's fees when compared to those whose rates are average. Rates of prenatal diagnosis are generally low amongst women in rural Victoria, with the lowest rates observed in farming districts. Reasons for this are likely to be a combination of lack of access to services (remoteness) and individual opportunity (lack of transportation, low levels of support and income). However, there are additional reasons for low uptake rates in farming areas that could not be explained by the behaviour modelling. These may relate to women's attitudes and choices. Conclusion A lack of statewide geodemographic consistency in uptake of prenatal diagnosis implies that there is a need to target health professionals and pregnant women in specific areas to ensure there is increased equity of access to services and that all pregnant women can make informed choices that are best for them. Equally as important is appropriate health service provision for families of children with Down syndrome. Our findings show that these potential interventions are particularly relevant in rural areas. Classifying data to lifestyle segments allowed for practical comparisons of the geodemographic characteristics of women having prenatal diagnosis in Australia at a population level. This methodology may in future be a feasible and cost-effective tool for service planners and policy developers. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Using {{self-reported}} health that assesses functionality or disability status, {{this paper}} investigates {{whether there are}} any differences in health status among older people living in a deprived area of Nairobi, Kenya. Data from a cross-sectional survey of 2, 037 men and women aged 50 years and older are {{used to examine the}} association between socioeconomic position and self-reported health status across 6 health domains. Education, occupation, a wealth index, and main source of livelihood are used to assess the presence of a socioeconomic gradient in health. All the indicators showed the expected negative association with health across some, but not all, of the disability domains. Nonetheless, differences based on occupation, the most commonly used indicators to examine health inequalities, were not statistically significant. Primary level of education was a significant factor for women but not for men; conversely, wealth status was associated with lower disability for both men and women. Older people dependent on their own sources of livelihood were also less likely to report a disability. The results suggest the need for further research to identify an appropriate <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>classification</b> that is sensitive in identifying poverty and deprivation among older people living in slums...|$|E
30|$|Given the {{widening}} gap in overall health between the more and less deprived groups {{in many countries}} (Son et al. 2012; Bacigalupe and Escolar-Pujolar 2014; Katikireddi et al. 2012), the finding of no significant disparities in preeclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage suggests that the presentation of disparities can differ, depending on health outcome and <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>classification.</b> According to Braveman et al. (2001) an income-based disparity was observed for lower birth weight and delayed antenatal visits, but not for unintended pregnancy. In a US study, the risks of low birth weight and preeclampsia were higher in African-Americans than in Hispanics while gestational diabetes was more prevalent in Hispanics than in African-Americans (Brown et al. 2007). A study in the UK on temporal trends in adverse perinatal outcome according to socioeconomic disparities showed different patterns of disparities between preterm birth and low birth weight (Glinianaia et al. 2013). In a research on female Spanish population, maternal education gradients in adverse perinatal outcome were significant only for the period 2009 – 2011, suggesting a negative impact of the economic recession (Juarez et al. 2014).

Methods: Data were obtained for 63 754 individuals in 23 countries from the first (2002) and second (2004) waves of the European Social Survey. The health outcomes were self-reported limiting longstanding illness and fair/poor general health. Occupational class was defined according to the European <b>Socioeconomic</b> <b>Classification</b> (ESeC). The magnitude of absolute and relative inequalities according to nine occupational classes for men and women separately were identified, analysed and compared in all four regions of Europe. Results: For both sexes and within all European regions, the higher and lower professionals, self-employed and higher service workers reported fewer cases of ill health than other occupational classes. In contrast, lower technical and routine workers reported the poorest health, excluding the relatively small number of farmers. Income and education did not explain more, or less, of the class-related health inequalities in the East compared with the other regions. Conclusions: Little evidence was found for the hypothesis that East European countries have larger class-related health inequalities than other European regions. People’s income and educational attainment both contribute to occupational health inequalities in the East {{as well as in the}} West...|$|E
40|$|Tropical {{forests are}} {{decreasing}} {{at the rate}} of 16. 9 million hectares per year due mainly to clearing for agriculture and shifting cultivation. Timber harvesting results for more than 5 million hectares of tropical forest becoming degraded looged-over forests every year without any adequate management. The decrease and degradation of tropical forests caused by anthropological activities affect not only the sustainable production of timber but also global environments. The clarified scientific information on the rehabilitation of degraded tropical forest ecosystems enables managers to devise silvicultural systems which enhance soil properties and forest resources important to sustainable production and minimise deleterious effects associated with harvesting impacts and short rotation of plantation. Rehabilitation is aimed to improve biological diversity, increasing commercial value for timber and non-timber products, increasing forest functions, improve soil fertility. Technically developments are expected for reducing logging impacts, accelerating natural regeneration, species selection, enrichment, sustainable site management, catalytic plantation, site evaluation and <b>classification.</b> <b>Socioeconomic</b> developments are also expected for local community participation and socio-economic acceptability. Following research activities have been considered (1) evaluation of forest harvesting impacts on the forest ecosystems: (i) evaluate logging and yarding methods on disturbance of forest ecosystems, (ii) analyse the demography of regenerated tree population, (iii) model a/de-gradation processes in forest ecosystems, (2) development of methods to rehabilitate logged-over forests and degraded forest lands: (i) treatments accelerating natural regeneration, (ii) development of enrichment planting methods, (3) development of silvicultural techniques on degraded forest lands: (i) development of species-site matching methods, (ii) management options for sustained productivity, (iii) social and economic acceptability of management options. In Indonesia, CIFOR co-operates with Universitas Mulawarman, and looks at (a) evaluation of forest harvesting impacts on the forest ecosystems, and (b) evaluation of forest harvesting and fire impacts on the forest ecosystems and development of methods to rehabilitate logged-over forest and degraded lands. The site is Bukit Soeharto Education Forest, a mixed Dipterocarp forest logged by INHUTANI I in 1976. The forest has been heavily burnt in 1998 after experimental treatment. The approach to rehabilitation has been through the "taungya system" whereby farmers are allowed to grow annual crops among the newly-planted trees. With the Instituto Nacional de Investigacion Agraria (INIA), Peru, the project is trying out re-vegetation of abandoned fallow fields after agricultural use. There is specific interest to select tree species having high economic value that can adapt and grow rapidly in abandoned agricultural land and on infertile soils. Sites are all located in the Ucayali region of the Peruvian Amazon. After the first two years, results are pointing to specific promising species that can be recommended. The project involves small farmers in silvicultural activities and even species choice takes into account their preferences...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To assess which {{socio-economic}} indicator best predicts overweight in the European Union: educational attainment, occupational class or household income. SETTING: The prevalence of overweight is {{strongly related to}} socio-economic position. The relative importance of different socio-economic dimensions is uncertain, and might vary between countries. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Cross-sectional self-report data of the European Community Household Panel were obtained from nine countries (n 52, 855; age 25 - 64 years). Uni- and multivariate regression analyses were employed to predict overweight (BMI >or= 25 kg/m 2) in relationship to {{socio-economic indicator}}s. Occupational class was measured using the new European <b>Socioeconomic</b> <b>Classification.</b> RESULTS: Large socio-economic differences in overweight were observed in all countries, especially for women. For both sexes, a low educational attainment was the strongest predictor of overweight. After controlling for education, overweight was negatively related to household income in women, but positively in men. Similar patterns were found for occupational class. For women, but not for men, educational inequalities in overweight were generally greater in Southern European countries. A similar pattern of inequalities in overweight was observed for all ages between 25 and 64 years. CONCLUSIONS: Across Europe, overweight was more strongly and more consistently related to educational attainment than to occupational class or household income. People with lower educational attainment should be a specific target group for programmes and policies that aim to prevent overweigh...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare {{self-reported}} dental fear among dental students and patients at a School of Dentistry in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Eighty students ranging in age from 20 to 29 years and 80 patients ranging in age from 18 to 65 years participated in the study. A self-administered pre-tested questionnaire consisting of 13 items was used for data acquisition. The city of Belo Horizonte Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was employed for <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>classification.</b> The chi-square test and binary and multinomial logistic regression were employed in the statistical analysis, with the significance level set at 0. 05. The majority of dental students (76. 5 %) sought the dentist for the first time for a routine exam, while patients (77. 3 %) mostly sought a dentist for the treatment of dental pain. Dental fear was more prevalent among the patients (72. 5 %) than the students (27. 5 %). A total of 47. 1 % of the students and 52. 9 % of the patients reported having had negative dental experiences in childhood. The logistic model revealed an association between dental fear and a pain-related experience (OR: 1. 8; 95 %CI: 1. 3 – 2. 6). Patients were more prone to dental fear (OR: 2. 2; 95 %CI: 1. 0 – 5. 0).

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the present}} study was to test the {{association}} between social vulnerability and the prevalence of traumatic dental injury (TDI). A population-based cross-sectional study was carried out with 1, 556 schoolchildren aged 11 to 14 years in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The participants were examined for TDI using Andreasen’s criteria and those diagnosed with TDI were interviewed to determine the history of the injury. The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was used for <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>classification,</b> which addresses environmental, cultural, economic, legal and security/survival dimensions. The Poisson regression model was used for the multivariate analysis, with the significance level set at 5 %. The prevalence of TDI was 14. 1 %; 59. 3 % of the participants with TDI did not seek a dentist after the incident. Poorer environmental, economic and legal conditions were statistically associated with the occurrence of untreated TDI (p < 0. 05) and all the five SVI dimensions were associated with seeking a dentist due to TDI (p < 0. 006). The prevalence of untreated TDI was higher among boys (PR: 1. 42; 95 %CI: 1. 11 – 1. 81) and those in situations of greater social vulnerability (PR: 2. 27; 95 %CI: 1. 11 – 4. 61). In conclusion, the male gender and high social vulnerability proved to be associated with th...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the age of 12 was {{determined}} as the age of global monitoring of caries for international comparisons and monitoring of disease trends. The aimed was to evaluate the prevalence of dental caries, fluorosis and periodontal condition and their relation with socioeconomic factors among schoolchildren aged twelve in the city of Manaus, AM. This study with a probabilistic sample of 661 children was conducted, 609 from public and 52 from private schools, in 2008. Dental caries, periodontal condition and dental fluorosis were evaluated. In order to obtain the <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>classification</b> of each child (high, upper middle, middle, lower middle, low and lower low socioeconomic classes), the guardians were given a questionnaire. The mean decayed teeth, missing teeth, and filled teeth (DMFT) found at age twelve was 1. 89. It was observed that the presence of dental calculus was the most severe periodontal condition detected in 39. 48 %. In relation to dental fluorosis, there was a low prevalence in the children examined, i. e., the more pronounced lines of opacity only occasionally merge, forming small white areas. The study showed a significant association of 5 % among social class with dental caries and periodontal condition. In schoolchildren of Manaus there are low mean of DMFT and fluorosis, but a high occurrence of gingival bleeding...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{clusters of}} the major occurrences of leprosy and their associated socioeconomic and demographic factors. METHODS: Cases of leprosy that occurred between 1998 and 2007 in Sao Jose do Rio Preto (southeastern Brazil) were geocodified and the incidence rates were calculated by census tract. A <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>classification</b> score was obtained using principal component analysis of socioeconomic variables. Thematic maps to visualize the spatial distribution of the incidence of leprosy with respect to socioeconomic levels and demographic density were constructed using geostatistics. RESULTS: While the incidence rate for the entire city was 10. 4 cases per 100, 000 inhabitants annually between 1998 and 2007, the incidence rates of individual census tracts were heterogeneous, with values that ranged from 0 to 26. 9 cases per 100, 000 inhabitants per year. Areas with a high leprosy incidence were associated with lower socioeconomic levels. There were identified clusters of leprosy cases, however there was no association between disease incidence and demographic density. There was a disparity between {{the places where the}} majority of ill people lived and the location of healthcare services. CONCLUSIONS: The spatial analysis techniques utilized identified the poorer neighborhoods of the city as the areas with the highest risk for the disease. These data show that health departments must prioritize politico-administrative policies to minimize the effects of social inequality and improve the standards of living, hygiene, and education of the population {{in order to reduce the}} incidence of leprosy...|$|E
40|$|Good {{oral health}} can be {{achieved}} by preventive dental behaviours such as regular dental visits as well as practising adequate selfcare by means of proper and frequent tooth brushing methods. OBJECTIVES: To correlate the influence of socio-economic parameters (occupation, education and income) according to modified Kuppuswamy's scale on preventive dental behaviours such as frequency of dental visits and tooth brushing with paste. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire based cross sectional survey was conducted to determine the influence of socio- economic status on Dental visits and frequency of tooth brushing in patients visiting the O. P. D (Out Patient Department) at I. T. S Dental College, Greater Noida. A total of 327 patients from 18 to 74 years were included from both the genders. A fifteen item closed ended questionnaire was prepared, which had information regarding the Chief complaint along with Age, Gender, Socioeconomic Status, intervals of dental visits and frequency of brushing. Kuppuswamy's <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>classification,</b> which includes monthly income, education level and occupation, was used to classify the socioeconomic status (SES) of the patients. RESULTS:There was no statistically significant difference reported between various levels of education, socio-economic status and gender when correlated with the frequency of dental visits. However, the results show that with increase in the level of education and socio-economic status the frequency of tooth brushing was positively correlated. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that groups with low education and socio-economic status are important targets to enhance dental preventive behaviours...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} 2 decades, socioeco-nomic inequalities in {{mortality}} {{have been studied}} extensively in countries around the world. Inequalities in mortality have been documented from the United States ' to the former Soviet Union, 2 from the Netherlands 3 to New Zealand, 4 and from Bangladesh 5 to Brazil. 6 Many studies, however, have been confined to men, partly because the most fre-quently used <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>classification,</b> that based on occupation, can less easily be applied to women. Women {{who are not in}} paid employment cannot be classified accord-ing to their own occupational class, and even ifthey can be classified, their own occupation may not be an adequate indicator of the socioeconomic status of the household they are part of. 7 ' 8 From studies that have included women, it has become clear that inequalities in mortal-ity exist among women as they do among men, but they tend to be smaller among women. 9 - 3 This finding may be an artifact in studies that used occupational class as an indi-cator of socioeconomic status, but similar findings were reported from a few studies that used education level or material living stan-dards as socioeconomic indicators. 8 14 - 17 Finnish data suggest that the inequalities in mortality between women and men may partly be the result of differences between women and men in cause-of-death pattem. 15 " 16 We report here on a study of differences by sex in the magnitude of socioeconomic inequalities in total and cause-specific mor...|$|E
