5|$|In 2008 FIDE {{added the}} variant Chess960 to the {{appendix}} of the Laws of Chess. Chess960 uses a random initial set-up of main pieces, with {{the conditions that}} the king is placed <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two rooks, and bishops on opposite-color squares. The castling rules are extended to cover all these positions.|$|E
5|$|Between the {{extremes}} of bicycles with classical front-wheel steering and those with strictly rear-wheel steering is a class of bikes with a pivot point <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated steering. An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo's {{solution}} to the solar neutrino problem involved an idea that he had first considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This {{was the idea that}} neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. <b>Somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. An important point was that for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel at the speed of light. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments.|$|E

5|$|For {{the third}} format, the show reverted to its {{original}} title Temperatures Rising, and the proposed number of episodes was reduced from eleven to seven. The series' production resumed on November 17, 1973, after a three-week shutdown. Sudie Bond, Barbara Cason, Jennifer Darling, Jeff Morrow, and John Dehner were dropped from the cast and a new line-up was assembled. Paul Lynde continued as Dr. Paul Mercy while Alice Ghostley played Edwina Moffitt, the admissions nurse and Dr. Mercy's sister. She had appeared as a guest star in an episode in the first season of Temperatures Rising. Nancy Fox returned as student nurse Ellen Turner, and Barbara Rucker was introduced as Nurse Amanda Kelly. Cleavon Little returned {{for a third time}} as Dr. Jerry Nolan, whose character was now being presented as <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> jive-talking surgeon of the first season and the serious one of the second.|$|E
5|$|By 19 March Fay's track {{had turned}} to the west-southwest, {{and over the next}} day it {{continued}} to strengthen in due to favourable upper level outflow and weak vertical sheer. On 21 March, Fay became a Category5 cyclone on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. A mid-latitude trough caused the steering ridge to weaken, and subsequently, Fay to turn to the south. Over the next two days, the environmental shear around the cyclone decreased, which would normally have led to intensification; however, as the shear decreased, the cyclone also moved over an area of dry air, weakening the system. By 23 March, Fay had moved in a loop, and the system weakened to a Category 2. Over the next day, favourable outflow counteracted the dry air that had weakened the system, and a banding eye feature was observed on satellite imagery. Fay then encountered moister air as it moved southward, leading it to re-intensify on 25 March. A weak eye of 10 nm was observed on 26 March which grew to 15nm as the day went on. Strengthening into a Category 4 system early on 27 March, Fay made landfall on the Pilbara coast between 8am and 9am AWST (0000 and 0100UTC) with winds of , weakening below cyclone strength <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> towns of Nullagine and Telfer.|$|E
5|$|In 567 {{the allies}} made their final move against Cunimund, with Alboin invading the Gepids' lands from the {{northwest}} while Bayan attacked from the northeast. Cunimund attempted to prevent the two armies joining up by moving against the Lombards and clashing with Alboin <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Tibiscus and Danube rivers. The Gepids were defeated in the ensuing battle, their king slain by Alboin, and Cunimund's daughter Rosamund taken captive, according to references in the Origo. The full destruction of the Gepid kingdom was completed by the Avars, who overcame the Gepids in the east. As a result, the Gepids ceased to exist as an independent people, and were partly absorbed by the Lombards and the Avars. Some time before 568, Alboin's first wife Chlothsind died, and after his victory against Cunimund Alboin married Rosamund, to establish a bond with the remaining Gepids. The war also marked a watershed in the geo-political history of the region, as together with the Lombard migration the following year, it signalled the end of six centuries of Germanic dominance in the Pannonian Basin.|$|E
