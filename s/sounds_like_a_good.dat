5000|$|Dez Skinn set up Warrior {{magazine}} in 1982 and asked Lloyd {{to create a}} new pulp character. Lloyd and writer Alan Moore, who had previously collaborated on several Doctor Who stories at Marvel UK, created V for Vendetta, a dystopian adventure featuring a flamboyant anarchist terrorist fighting against a future fascist government. Lloyd, who illustrated in cinematic chiaroscuro, devised V's Guy Fawkes-inspired appearance and suggested that Moore avoid captions, sound effects and thought balloons. Lloyd stated in a 2005 interview that [...] "I don't know why I thought of Guy Fawkes, because it was during the summer. I thought that would be great if he looked like Guy Fawkes, kind of theatrical. I just suggested it to Alan, and he said, 'that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea.' It gave us everything, the costume and everything. During the summer, I couldn't get any of these masks. These masks that you could get in every shop had a smile built into them. So I created this Guy Fawkes mask with a kind of smile. It was an ideal costume for this future anarchist persona." [...] After Warrior folded in 1984, the series was reprinted and continued in colour by DC Comics in 1988 and collected as a graphic novel in 1995. It was adapted into a film released in 2006. The stylized Guy Fawkes mask that Lloyd created for V for Vendetta has transcended the story and made its way into the real world, frequently being used by protesters (particularly Anonymous) demonstrating against the injustices of governments, cults, financial institutions and other powerful organizations.|$|E

These are interesting philosophical questions that Mark Walker addresses in his book Happy-People-Pills for All.

40|$|Abstract. More {{and more}} {{software}} use cryptography. But {{how can one}} know if what is implemented is good cryptography? For proprietary software, one cannot say much unless one proceeds to reverse-engineering, and history tends to show that bad cryptography is much more frequent than good cryptography there. Open source software thus <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> solution, {{but the fact that}} a source code can be read does not imply that it is actually read, especially by cryptography experts. In this paper, we illustrate this point by examining the case of a basic Internet application of cryptography: secure email. We analyze parts of thesourcecodeofthelatestversionofGNUPrivacyGuard(GnuPGor GPG), a free open source alternative to the famous PGP software, compliant with the OpenPGP standard, and included in most GNU/Linux distributions such as Debian, MandrakeSoft, Red Hat and SuSE. We observe several cryptographic flaws in GPG v 1. 2. 3. The most serious flaw has been present in GPG for almost four years: we show that as soon as one (GPG-generated) ElGamal signature of an arbitrary message is released, one can recover the signer’s private key in less than a second on a PC. As a consequence, ElGamal signatures and the so-called ElGamal sign+encrypt keys have recently been removed from GPG. Fortunately, ElGamal was not GPG’s default option for signing keys...|$|E
40|$|Software reuse is only {{effective}} {{if it is}} easier to locate (and appropriately modify) a reusable component than to write it from scratch. We present stgmatum rrzatchtng as a method for achieving this goal by using signature information eas-ily derived from the component. We consider two kinds of software components, functions and modules, and hence two kinds of matching, function matching and module matching. The signature of a function is simply its type; the signature of a module is a multiset of user-defined types and a multi-set of function signatures. For both functions and modules, we consider not just emzct match, but also various flavors of relaxed match. We briefly describe an experimental facility written in Standard ML for performing signature matching over a library of ML functions. 1 What is Signature Matching? Software reuse <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea. It promises advan-tages like reducing the time and cost spent on program-ming, increasing programmers ’ productivity y, and increasing program reliability [BP 89, AM 87, IEE 84, Pre 87].

Reuse is only worth it if {{it is easier to}} locate (and appropriately modify) a reusable com-ponent than to write it from scratch.
