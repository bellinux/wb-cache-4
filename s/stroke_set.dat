40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{framework}} for the recognition of online handwritten graphics. Three main features of the framework are its ability to treat symbol and structural level information in an integrated way, its flexibility with respect to different families of graphics, and means to control the tradeoff between recognition effectiveness and computational cost. We model a graphic as a labeled graph generated from a graph grammar. Non-terminal vertices represent subcomponents, terminal vertices represent symbols, and edges represent relations between subcomponents or symbols. We then model the recognition problem as a graph parsing problem: given an input <b>stroke</b> <b>set,</b> we search for a parse tree that represents the best interpretation of the input. Our graph parsing algorithm generates multiple interpretations (consistent with the grammar) and then we extract an optimal interpretation according to a cost function that takes into consideration the likelihood scores of symbols and structures. The parsing algorithm consists in recursively partitioning the <b>stroke</b> <b>set</b> according to structures defined in the grammar {{and it does not}} impose constraints present in some previous works (e. g. stroke ordering). By avoiding such constraints and thanks to the powerful representativeness of graphs, our approach can be adapted to the recognition of different graphic notations. We show applications to the recognition of mathematical expressions and flowcharts. Experimentation shows that our method obtains state-of-the-art accuracy in both applications.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: A {{decision}} {{analysis was performed}} to explore {{the potential benefits of}} interventions to improve the outcome of patients admitted to hospital with a stroke, {{in the context of the}} technology available in different parts of the world. METHODS: The outcome of death or dependency was used with a six-month end-point. RESULTS: Four settings were identified that would depend on the resources available. The proportion of stroke patients who were dead or dependent at six months was 61. 5 % with no intervention at all. Setting 4, with the only intervention being the delayed introduction of aspirin, produced a 0. 5 % absolute improvement in outcome (death or dependency), and the addition of an organized <b>stroke</b> unit (<b>Setting</b> 3) produced the largest incremental improvement, of 2. 7 %. Extra interventions associated with non-urgent computed tomography and thus the ability to avoid anticoagulation or aspirin for those with a haemorrhagic <b>stroke</b> (<b>Setting</b> 2), and immediate computed tomography scanning to allow the use of thrombolytics in non-haemorrhagic <b>stroke</b> (<b>Setting</b> 1), produced only small incremental benefits of 0. 4 % in each case. DISCUSSION: To reduce the burden of illness due to stroke, efforts at primary prevention are essential and likely to have a greater impact than even the best interventions after the event. In the absence of good primary prevention, whatever is possible must be done to reduce the sequelae of stroke. This analysis provides a rational basis for beginning the development of clinical guidelines applicable to the economic setting of the patient...|$|R

40|$|Currently several {{endovascular}} modalities {{and devices}} {{are available for}} use in acute ischemic <b>stroke</b> <b>setting.</b> Limited data exist regarding the relative efficacy of these different options when used individually or in combination. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to retrospectively compare the recanalization rates of various endovascular options when used for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in the anterior cerebral circulation. We retrospectively reviewed 132 consecutive patients treated endovascularly at our center for acute ischemic stroke in the anterior cerebral circulation. Recanalization was defined as mTIMI of ≥ 2 while complete recanalization was defined as mTIMI of 4. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the modality or combination of modalities associated with best recanalization rate. Recanalization was achieved in 74 % of patients while complete recanalization was achieved in 39 % of patients. No individual endovascular therapy was significantly different from others in achieving recanalization. Where a multimodality approach was used, combination of angioplasty with intra- or extracranial stent placement was significantly (p= 0. 05) associated with recanalization. On regression analysis, combination of intra-arterial tPA with a mechanical modality (p= 0. 09) was significantly associated with recanalization while combination of intravenous tPA with intracranial stent placement (p= 0. 06) was significantly associated with complete recanalization. Combination of pharmacological and mechanical modalities in the setting of multimodal therapy is associated with increased likelihood of successful recanalization in patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior cerebral circulation.

40|$|Acute stroke care is characterised by a {{focus on}} rapid, {{thorough}} assessment and early management (National Stroke Foundation, 2007) and the upper limb is a common focus for assessment by occupational therapists. Upper limb assessment practices in the acute care setting need to be applicable to a population that displays {{a wide range of}} abilities as a result of differing levels of stroke severity (Lannin, 2004). Often multiple assessment tools are utilised throughout this process due to the variation in stroke manifestations and the clients 2 ̆ 7 changing needs as they recover (Woodson, 1995). Two approaches to upper limb assessment common in the acute setting are assessment at the impairment level and general assessment of the upper limb {{in the context of a}} self care assessment. However, neither of these approaches specifically measures the client’s ability to use the upper limb in a functional manner. An alternative approach is assessment of upper limb ability which is defined as the use of the arm in meaningful activity and incorporates activities of daily living. The Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory- 9 (CAHAI- 9) is one assessment that examines upper limb ability for clients with stroke. The CAHAI- 9 demonstrates excellent reliability and validity (Rowland & Gustafsson, 2008), however there is minimal documentation of clinical utility. Clinical utility refers to how easy an assessment is to use (Law et al., 1990) and is one of the most significant influences on the actual use of an assessment in a clinical situation (Law, Baum, & Dunn, 2005). The purpose of this research was to investigate the clinical utility of the CAHAI- 9 in the acute <b>stroke</b> <b>setting</b> and included a preliminary and main study. The preliminary study involved a retrospective review of the clinical application of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT), and Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI) in one acute <b>stroke</b> <b>setting.</b> Thirty-three medical records of clients admitted to a major metropolitan acute stroke unit were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were: (a) admission between March and August 2006, (b) new diagnosis of stroke, (c) upper limb involvement, and (d) assessed by an occupational therapist with ARAT, AMAT or CAHAI. The results could not identify which assessment was most suited to the acute <b>stroke</b> <b>setting.</b> Additional criteria were applied to select CAHAI- 9 for further investigation in the main study. The main study incorporated a multi-centre, mixed methods design. The aim was to investigate the clinical utility of CAHAI- 9 in an acute <b>stroke</b> <b>setting.</b> There were two groups of participants; occupational therapists and clients with stroke. Thirty-two occupational therapists from eight hospitals completed 100 CAHAI- 9 assessments on 92 clients with stroke over 6 months. In the first phase, the occupational therapist participants completed a series of questionnaires regarding the clinical utility of CAHAI- 9 and these data were summarised descriptively. In the second phase, both therapists and clients with stroke were invited to be involved in a qualitative investigation into CAHAI- 9 ’s clinical utility. Twenty-one of the thirty-two occupational therapist participants participated in semi-structured focus groups. Five clients with acute stroke were recruited by consecutive sampling from one metropolitan hospital and participated in structured individual interviews. The focus groups and interviews were transcribed verbatim and were analysed thematically. The results of the quantitative and qualitative data were compared to identify patterns of convergence and variation in opinions regarding the clinical utility of CAHAI- 9. Overall, participants reported that the CAHAI- 9 could be administered in the acute care setting and the majority of CAHAI- 9 assessments could be conducted by the bedside. Although the practical aspects of CAHAI- 9 administration were well suited to the acute <b>stroke</b> <b>setting,</b> the participants expressed concern about the scoring reliability and the effectiveness of the training DVDs. Overall the participants found CAHAI- 9 was useful for supporting clinical decision making by identifying non-motor deficits, facilitating communication and continuum of care decisions. Participants agreed that CAHAI- 9 was suitable for assessment of moderate upper limb deficits, and were less sure of suitability for assessment of severe upper limb deficits. There were varying opinions within the therapists and clients regarding CAHAI- 9 suitability for assessment of mild upper limb deficits. Overall, the clinical utility of CAHAI- 9 appears supported by the results of this study with the majority of therapists indicating they would use CAHAI- 9 again with the clients they assessed. Further studies should address therapists’ reduced scoring confidence by developing an alternative CAHAI- 9 training program that meets the learning requirements of Australian therapists. Limitations of this study and future research directions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{guidelines}} and policies recommend exercise after <b>stroke.</b> Person-centred goal <b>setting</b> may facilitate the uptake {{and maintenance of}} physical activity. The aim of this work was to design and evaluate a goal setting intervention in an exercise after <b>stroke</b> <b>setting.</b> Five interlinked studies were undertaken within the development and feasibility stages of the MRC framework of complex interventions. A systematic review examined 17 observational studies (11 quantitative, six qualitative) for the effects and experiences of goal <b>setting</b> in <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation (study one). Despite some positive effects, no firm conclusion could be reached regarding its effectiveness. Patients and professionals differed in their experiences. Barriers to goal setting outnumbered facilitators. The lack of a standardised goal <b>setting</b> method in <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation was highlighted. A goal setting intervention tailored to exercise after stroke was developed in study two, based on: findings from study one, Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. The intervention components were: dedicated time, patient education, patient involvement, regular follow-up, and a purpose-designed workbook. This intervention was piloted in study three alongside validation of the activPAL™ activity monitor with 12 stroke survivors. The intervention did not require modification. Only two variables of the activPAL™ (time spent in sitting and upright) had acceptable validity and reliability. Feasibility of the intervention and users’ experiences were investigated in study four with four stroke survivors, using mixed methods case studies. Intervention delivery and compliance were acceptable with no adverse effects. Findings regarding acceptability and content suggested a need for further work. Participants’ interest and engagement in goal setting were influenced by their familiarity with goal setting, interest in physical activity, functional ability and levels of self-efficacy, highlighting the individualisation required within goal setting. Experiences of exercise professionals involved in exercise after <b>stroke</b> regarding goal <b>setting</b> were explored in study five through three focus groups (n= 6; n= 6; n= 3). Although goal setting was viewed positively, participants felt that its potential effectiveness was not always translated into practice due to barriers encountered: clients’ readiness to change, professionals’ {{lack of knowledge about}} stroke and a number of organisational factors. Suggestions to improve goal setting in practice were discussed. This work has enhanced our understanding of goal setting as a complex intervention. Recognition of the potential benefits of goal setting by both service users and providers, amidst the challenges, argues in favour of goal setting in the exercise after <b>stroke</b> <b>setting.</b> Areas for further research have been discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Minocycline, a second-generation {{tetracycline}} with anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties, {{has been}} shown to promote therapeutic benefits in experimental stroke. However, equally compelling evidence demonstrates that the drug exerts variable and even detrimental effects in many neurological disease models. Assessment of the mechanism underlying minocycline neuroprotection should clarify the drug's clinical value in acute <b>stroke</b> <b>setting.</b> Results Here, we demonstrate that minocycline attenuates both in vitro (oxygen glucose deprivation) and in vivo (middle cerebral artery occlusion) experimentally induced ischemic deficits by direct inhibition of apoptotic-like neuronal cell death involving the anti-apoptotic Bcl- 2 /cytochrome c pathway. Such anti-apoptotic effect of minocycline is seen in neurons, but not apparent in astrocytes. Our data further indicate that the neuroprotection is dose-dependent, in that only low dose minocycline inhibits neuronal cell death cascades at the acute stroke phase, whereas the high dose exacerbates the ischemic injury. Conclusion The present study advises our community to proceed with caution to use the minimally invasive intravenous delivery of low dose minocycline in order to afford neuroprotection that is safe for stroke. </p...|$|R
