40|$|SUMMARY: The subclavian-axillary {{arterial}} tree {{is responsible}} for the arterial supply to the rotator cuff muscles as well as other shoulder muscles. This study comprised the bilateral dissection of the shoulder and upper arm region in thirty-one adult and nineteen fetal cadaveric specimens. The variable origins and branching patterns of the axillary, subscapular, circumflex scapular, thoracodorsal, posterior circumflex humeral and <b>suprascapular</b> <b>arteries</b> identified in this study corroborated the findings of previous studies. In addition, unique variations that are unreported in the literature were also observed. The precise anatomy of the arterial distribution to the rotator cuff muscles is important to the surgeon and radiologist. It will aid proper interpretation of radiographic images and avoid injury to this area during surgical procedures.

40|$|The {{accessory}} ascending cervical artery (Murakami et al., 1996), which {{arises from}} the subclavian artery and ascends between the scalenus anterior and medius muscles, was studied in 87 Japanese adult cadavers (174 sides), with special attention being given to its origin, distribution, and relationship to other arteries at the cervical or scalenus region. In 154 sides (88. 5 %), the accessory ascending cervical artery was found to originate from the subclavian artery behind the scalenus anterior muscle, and to branch out to the scalenus anterior and medius muscles {{as well as those}} entering the 5 th and 6 th intervertebral foramens along the 6 th and 7 th cervical nerves. This artery arose independently in 105 sides. The accessory ascending cervical artery issued off or formed a common trunk with the transverse cervical artery and/or costocervical trunk in 49 sides. In cases lacking the accessory ascending cervical artery, it was usually compensated for by the costocervial trunk and/or transverse cervical artery (18 sides). Common trunk formation with the vertebral, internal thoracic, or <b>suprascapular</b> <b>arteries</b> was not observed. The authors suggest that the accessory ascending cervical artery, the transverse cervical artery, and the costocervical trunk should be grouped into one arterial system, a system that may be a remnant of the precostal longitudinal anastomoses of intersegmental arteries of the dorsal aorta behind the scalenus anterior muscle. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> {{branches}} {{off from}} the thyrocervical trunk, which in turn arises from {{the first part of}} the subclavian artery. This <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> crosses over the suprascapular ligament, passes through the supraspinous fossa and turns around the lateral border of the spine of the scapula and supplies the infraspinous fossa as far as the inferior angle.|$|E
40|$|Abstract A unique {{anatomical}} {{variation of}} the suprascap-ular notch was discovered in one scapula from 610 analyzed by three-dimensional CT reconstruction. Two bony bridges were found, converting it into a double suprascapular fora-men, in the left upper extremity of an 56 -year-old Caucasian female. This variation might be {{a risk factor for}} suprascap-ular nerve entrapment. Suprascapular nerve running through inferior suprascapular foramen was discovered. Suprascap-ular vessels passed through superior <b>suprascapular</b> foramen (<b>artery</b> lay medially and vein laterally). A new hypothesis of double suprascapular foramen formation (mechanism of creation) is presented based on recent anatomical findings (e. g., the discovery in 2002 of the anterior coracoscapular ligament). Knowledge of the anatomical variations de-scribed in this study should be helpful in arthroscopic and open procedures at the suprascapular region and also con-firms the safety of operative decompression for the supra-scapular nerve...|$|R

50|$|The {{transverse}} cervical artery (transverse artery of neck or transversa colli artery) is {{an artery}} {{in the neck}} and {{a branch of the}} thyrocervical trunk, running at a higher level than the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Lateral {{thoracic}} artery. If {{the lateral}} thoracic artery is not branching from the axillary artery, {{will most likely}} branch from the following (in order of likelihood): (1) thoracoacromial, (2) third part of axillary artery, (3) <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery,</b> (4) subscapular artery ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> and {{transverse}} cervical artery both head laterally {{and cross}} {{in front of}} (anterior to) the scalenus anterior muscle and the phrenic nerve. The inferior thyroid artery runs superiorly from the thyrocervical trunk to the inferior portion of the thyroid gland.|$|E
50|$|This notch is {{converted}} into a foramen by the superior transverse scapular ligament, and serves for {{the passage of the}} suprascapular nerve (but not its corresponding artery); sometimes the ligament is ossified. The <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> travels superiorly to the superior transverse ligament.|$|E
50|$|It has an {{ascending}} {{branch and}} a descending branch. The descending {{branch of the}} transverse cervical artery anastomoses with the deep and dorsal scapular artery which in turn links to the subscapular. This anastomosis is a ring circulation around the scapula where it continues to the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> via the circumflex scapular artery.|$|E
50|$|The {{axillary}} artery may be safely clamped without endangering the arm, {{but only in}} a location proximal to {{the origin of the}} subscapular artery (and distal to the thyrocervical trunk of the subclavian artery). The anastomotic network surrounding the scapula provides an alternate path for collateral circulation to the arm from arteries including the dorsal scapular artery and <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Variations {{concerning}} {{the origin and}} course of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> are numerous and present important clinical implications. Aim: In the present study the origin and course of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> are investigated {{in a sample of}} Greek (Caucasian) origin. Materials and Methods: The anatomy and course of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> were carefully examined in 31 adult human cadavers (16 male and 15 female). Results: Anomalous origin of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> from the third segment of the subclavian artery was observed in the right side of only one female Caucasian specimen (1 / 62 = 1. 6 %). The <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> and the suprascapular nerve passed together under the superior transverse scapular ligament through the suprascapular notch, whereas the suprascapular vein was absent. Conclusion: According to the available literature, this type of variation in the origin of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> is considered rare. This variation is clinically important, since it is related to the creation mechanism of suprascapular neuropathy and has also obvious surgical implications. The variation is embryologically enlightened and has an interesting ontogenic aspect...|$|E
40|$|Variation in {{the origin}} of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> was {{observed}} in one of the 30 cadavers dissected. The <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> in our case emerged from {{the first part of the}} axillary artery on the left side in a male cadaver, while it arose from the thyrocervical trunk on the right side in the same cadaver. Later in its course it passed obliquely behind the clavicle and brachial plexus to reach the suprascapular notch where it was accompanied by the suprascapular nerve, and both together passed beneath the transverse scapular ligament. It then supplied supraspinatus and took part in the anastomosis around the scapula...|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of the {{morphology}} of the {{suprascapular notch}} region is important from a clinical {{point of view}} {{because it is the}} most common site of suprascapular nerve compression and injury. A group of 120 patients underwent ultrasound examination of the suprascapular notch region according to our original four-stage “step-by-step” protocol. The notches were classified based on their morphology and measurements like maximal depth (MD) and superior transverse diameter (STD) as follows: type I-MD is longer than STD, type II-MD and STD are equal, type III-STD is longer than MD, and in type IV/V-notches only the bony margin was visualized without depression. Both suprascapular notches were fully visualized in 115 of 120 patients. The type III suprascapular notch was the most prevalent (64. 2 %), followed by type IV/V (18. 7 %), type I (11. 1 %), and type II (6. 0 %). Color Doppler analysis allowed the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> to be recognized in all visualized notches. The suprascapular vein was visible in 176 notches and the suprascapular nerve in 150. Notches containing both suprascapular nerve and vein were significantly wider and shallower than average. As the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> is the most easily recognised structure in the area, it may serve as a useful landmark of the suprascapular notch...|$|E

Our patient suffered trauma to his left shoulder resulting in fracture of his clavicle following an automobile accident and subsequently was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of his left <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> on imaging. This was treated by transarterial embolization, which resulted in immediate relief of his symptoms. Endoluminal management offers a safe and effective way of treating these lesions...|$|E

30|$|In this patient, {{there were}} several complicating factors {{including}} the surgical approach to the TEF given dense adhesions with two prior thoracotomies, flap choice, and conduit choice for esophageal reconstruction. Fortunately, the TEF was located on the cervicothoracic border, and a cervical approach was therefore chosen. A pectoralis major muscle or sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) flap can be suitable for repairing this tracheoesophageal fistula. A pectoralis major muscle flap is larger and thicker, and its covering area is wider. A SCM flap can be created easier in the same operative field. The larger pectoralis major muscle flap {{is considered to be}} more suitable for this patient to fill the dead space behind the membranous portion of the trachea. There was a problem about blood supply of SCM in this case. The upper third of SCM is supplied by branches of occipital artery. The middle third of SCM is supplied by branches of superior thyroid artery. The lower third of SCM is supplied by branches of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> [9]. There are two types of SCM flap: the superiorly based flap which is the commonly used and supplied from occipital artery and superior thyroid artery and the inferiorly based flap which is suitable for the lesion on the lower neck or upper mediastinum [10]. Though the inferiorly based sternocleidomastoid muscle flap was required according to the fistula position, the necrosis of the flap might occur because of no blood supply from branches of superior thyroid artery and <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> by previous cervical lymph node dissection. Therefore, the pectoralis major muscle was chosen over the SCM. With respect to esophageal reconstruction, small intestine reconstruction using the pedunculated jejunum with a microvascular anastomosis was chosen over a colonic conduit as there were dense adhesions of the transverse colon to the upper abdominal organs due to a previous total resection of the former gastric conduit.|$|E
40|$|Surgery is {{performed}} on the glenoid {{for a variety of}} pathologic conditions, and an adequate blood supply is required to achieve good healing of soft tissue and bone. The objective of this investigation was to study the arterial supply of the glenoid in 24 fresh human cadaveric specimens. The vascular supply originates from branches of the anterior and posterior circumflex arteries and the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> and branches directly from the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles. The antero-superior portion of the glenoid is poorly vascularized, with a specific area that is completely devoid of blood supply. In addition, circumferentially around the glenoid rim, there is an area of approximately 5 mm from the edge that is completely devoid of vascularity. Adequate bone and soft-tissue healing in the glenoid, particularly in its anterosuperior portion, after fracture repair, osteotomy, total shoulder arthroplasty, and capsular procedures may be compromised by the demonstrated hypovascularity...|$|E
40|$|Background: Intraoperative neurophysiologic {{monitoring}} is {{a commonly}} used adjunct during many neurointerventional procedures. Objective: Here {{we describe the}} rare occurrence of a hemorrhagic complication secondary to a subdermal needle electrode. Methods: A 67  year old male with a left-sided fusiform vertebrobasilar aneurysm was scheduled to undergo placement of a pipeline embolization device. The patient had been administered aspirin 325  mg and Plavix 75  mg daily for greater than one week preoperatively. After successfully undergoing endotracheal intubation, 7  mm length and 0. 4  mm diameter subdermal needle electrode intraoperative monitoring leads {{were placed in the}} scalp, mastoid and bilateral Erb's points Following successful completion of the procedure, but prior to extubation and closure of the femoral arterial site, the patient was noted to have a significant amount of swelling in the left neck and supraclavicular region in the immediate vicinity of the left Erb's point subdermal needle electrode. Review of the last angiographic run in the region noted active extravasation from a muscular branch of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>artery</b> immediately subjacent to the aforementioned subdermal electrode. The literature has been reviewed and recommendations for management and surveillance are made. Results: This case underscores the importance of monitoring and risk minimization in regards to hemorrhagic complications, especially in patients who are anticoagulated and receiving dual antiplatelet therapy, during neurointerventional procedures. Conclusion: Hemorrhagic complications associated with subdermal needle electrodes, though rare, can have significant consequences in patients...|$|E
