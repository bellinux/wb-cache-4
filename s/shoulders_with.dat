5|$|From {{a famous}} school, Mercator {{moved to the}} famous University of Leuven, where his full Latin name appears in the {{matriculation}} records for 1530. He lived {{in one of the}} teaching colleges, the Castle College, and, although he was classified as a pauper, he rubbed <b>shoulders</b> <b>with</b> richer students amongst whom were the anatomist Andreas Vesalius, the statesman Antoine Perrenot, and the theologian George Cassander, all destined to fame and all lifelong friends of Mercator.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Flames {{introduced}} a new third jersey to replace their throwback uniform. The newest design is Western-inspired, with a script Calgary in black {{across the front of}} the jersey, and black <b>shoulders</b> <b>with</b> points on the front mimicking cowboy wear. This uniform was used until the 2015–16 season, after which the throwback third uniforms used from 2010 to 2013 were revived anew.|$|E
5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve is tested by evaluating {{the function of}} the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The trapezius muscle is tested by asking the patient to shrug their <b>shoulders</b> <b>with</b> and without resistance. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is tested by asking the patient to turn their head to the left or right against resistance.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the marginal gap in terms of cement film thickness associated <b>with</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>with</b> 45 ° bevel, <b>shoulder</b> <b>with</b> 30 ° bevel and chamfer, under thermo-mechanical loading. Forty human mandibular molars were prepared and restored with ceramo-metal crowns. Teeth were thermo-mechanically loaded and vertically sectioned to evaluate the cement film thickness. <b>Shoulder</b> <b>with</b> 45 ° bevel provided the least marginal gap as compared with all the tested finish lines...|$|R

5|$|The collar is worn on {{designated}} collar days over {{military uniform}} or morning dress by members attending formal events. The collar is {{fastened to the}} <b>shoulders</b> <b>with</b> silk ribbons (or gold safety pins when worn with morning dress). Since the collar signifies the Order of the Garter, members can then wear the riband of any other order to which they belong. The collar is only worn at specific occasions that warrant it.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} most other non-avian theropods, Acrocanthosaurus forelimbs did not {{make contact with the}} ground and were not used for locomotion; instead they served a predatory function. The {{discovery}} of a complete forelimb (NCSM 14345) allowed the first analysis of the function and range of motion of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus. The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine how far the joints could move without dislocating. In many of the joints, the bones did not fit together exactly, indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the joints, as is seen in many living archosaurs. Among other findings, the study suggested that, in a resting position, the forelimbs would have hung from the <b>shoulders</b> <b>with</b> the humerus angled backwards slightly, the elbow bent, and the claws facing medially (inwards).|$|E
5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the <b>shoulders,</b> <b>with</b> the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E

5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and <b>shoulders</b> <b>with</b> his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E

25|$|Limehouse Basin {{opened in}} 1820 as the Regent's Canal Dock.

In {{a long and}} eventful career, he was successively a monarchist deputy during the Revolution and under the Directoire, an exile during the Terror, a deputy under Napoleon, Minister of the Interior to Louis XVIII and eventually, {{at the end of}} his {{political career}}, a simple ultra-royalist deputy.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, Riina orchestrated {{the murders of}} a number of {{high-profile}} public officials, such as judges, prosecutors and members of the police and the carabinieri. As well as intimidating the state, these assassinations also helped to frame the Corleonesi's rivals. The Godfathers of many Mafia Families were often highly visible in their communities, rubbing <b>shoulders</b> <b>with</b> politicians and mayors, protecting themselves with bribes rather than violence. In contrast, Riina, Provenzano and other Corleonesi were fugitives, always in hiding and rarely seen by other mobsters, let alone the public. Consequently, when a policeman or judge was killed it was the more visible Mafia Families who were the subject of official investigations, especially as these assassinations were deliberately carried out in the territory (or 'turf') of the Corleonesi's rivals rather than anywhere near the town of Corleone itself.|$|E
25|$|The Army's {{standard}} UCP {{is based}} on a pixelated version of the region's arid desert patterns. The army's UCP varies {{depending on the type of}} missions and deployment it is being used for. The Navy's UCP {{is based on}} a design that incorporates sparse black and medium grey shapes on a light grey background. The Marines have a woodland pattern featuring light brown, olive green and dark blue shapes on a tan or light olive background. Slight colour variations have been noted. Other than a greenish flight suit and a standard service dress, the Air Forces's Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) camouflage features a variation of the six-colour desert pattern. In each service's UCP, the name of the service branch, rank, and gallantry badges are worn on the chest; insignia are worn on the <b>shoulders</b> <b>with</b> the compulsory flag-of-Pakistan patch.|$|E
25|$|Women are {{becoming}} more confident {{in the workplace and}} are trying harder to step up in their career. More and more of these women want to fit into the management level by trying to emulate men via fashion and outward appearance to appear more masculine and powerful. Most of the higher position in the work field were occupied by man at that time, it is understandable that how womenswear is influenced by man’s figure and body feature to mock the general existing powerful image at that time. Hence, they would want garments that empower them and make them look more masculine in shape, thus making the woman appear to be more capable of higher level tasks and seem more professional by fitting in with the male majority. This would be accomplished with attributes such as wider <b>shoulders</b> <b>with</b> the aid of padding and larger sleeves.|$|E
