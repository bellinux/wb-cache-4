40|$|The {{need for}} energy {{conservation}} in buildings has spurred innovations in window technologies. These products include windows combined with shading devices, and windows featuring complex glazing such as switchable glazing, diffuse glazing, translucent and transparent insulation, patterned or decorative glass, etc. Current fenestration simulation tools for energy performance product ratings do not cover complex fenestration products. This paper addresses {{the development of}} detailed calculation models to compute the optical characteristics of complex fenestration products {{made up of a}} mixture of clear and scattering glazing layers. The models take into account not only the optical properties of the individual glazing layers making up the window product, but also the haze and gloss properties of the glazing layers. Specific optical models are developed to compute the optics of a clear substrate with applied or laminated scattering film, and composite film made up of a number of homogeneous materials with known optical properties. A general optical model was also developed for screen-like glazing panes such as insect/shading <b>screens,</b> <b>roller</b> blinds, drapery sheets, honeycomb transparent insulation and fibreglass translucent glazing...|$|R

40|$|Office {{buildings}} with large glass facades often face {{problems such as}} glare, thermal discomfort, overheating and increased energy demand. In this case study, thermal and daylighting simulation were performed in order to investigate the possible options for the facade renovation of a large office building in Montreal. For the daylighting part, the available daylight on the work plane surface of interior perimeter zones was calculated for each façade, considering several shading options: dark <b>screens,</b> <b>roller</b> shades with variable properties, reflective venetian blinds, translucent glazings and combinations of the above. Daylight rendering with and without shading helped in visualizing the results. The impact of different shading properties on glare was also studied, {{as well as the}} impact of window size on annual daylight autonomy for each case. For the thermal part, emphasis was given on the effect of shading location, properties and control on the thermal loads, since the glass facades account for {{a big part of the}} load. It was found that the shade location and properties have a significant impact on heating and cooling load as well as on the thermal comfort near the windows. The simulation results showed that a 60 % reduction in cooling demand – due to the façade- could be achieved, if controlled shades with small or variable transmittance and high outside reflectance will be used...|$|R

40|$|Solar gain through {{fenestration}} has {{a significant}} impact on building peak load and annual energy consumption. Shading devices, attached to fenestration, offer a cost effective strategy in controlling solar gain. The performance of a particular shading device is dependent on solar optical and longwave radiative properties of the device. The current study considers longwave properties of three flat shading materials; drapery fabrics, insect <b>screens</b> and <b>roller</b> blinds. Each of these materials consists of a structure (i. e., yarn, wire, sheet) that is opaque with respect to longwave (infrared) radiation and each material is likely to have some openness. Material emittance and longwave transmittance measurements were taken with an infrared reflectometer using two backing surfaces. The results show emittance and longwave transmittance to be simple functions of openness, emittance and longwave transmittance of the structure. This is especially useful because openness can be determined from solar transmittance measurements while emittance and longwave transmittance of the structure was found to be constant for each category of shading material.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} energy and light {{performance}} assessment of two configurations of an Active Transparent Façade (ATF), which are investigated {{by means of}} an experimental campaign that makes use of a full-scale mock-up room of an office building. The two configurations of the ATF (a Climate Façade integrated with the HVAC system) differ in the technology of the inner glazing (extra-clear single glass or double pane glazing with low-e coating), while share all the other features - i. e. external glazing, shading system, airflow path and ventilation rate, control strategies. The aim of the research activity is both to define a methodology to assess energy and light performance of each configuration, through elaboration of experimental data, and an attempt to apply the methodology to the specific case, in order to test it. Experimental investigations in test cells and/or real scale mock-up provide high quality data, but their representativeness and direct application is not always straightforward. Dedicated data analysis procedures and methods need thus to be developed in order to translate experimental data in useful information. Moreover, investigations are usually carried out on either the thermal or the light aspects, while combined analyses are not common, since this increases the degree of complexity of the analysis and measurement requirements are often quite different. The ATF module equipped with extra-clear single glass pane (Module A) shows, compared to that with a low-e coated double pane glazing (Module B), an increase in the average luminance, over the analyzed surfaces, in the range 20 %- 52 % and 16 %- 81 %, in absence and in presence of the shading systems respectively. A higher amount of daylight is then guaranteed within the indoor space by Module A, but this might result in a higher probability of visual discomfort for the occupants. On the other hand, the Module B determines lower daily energy transmitted toward the indoor environment than Module A: on average, the daily energy gain/loss from/toward the outdoor environment are reduced of about 30 %, in summer (with or without the reflective <b>roller</b> <b>screen),</b> and in the range 30 - 40 % in winter (with or without the reflective <b>roller</b> <b>screen...</b>|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study effects of grinding and pelleting on feed structure using either wheat or maize as a base ingredients. In experiment 1, four diets were formulated to contain either completely ground base ingredients using 3 mm and 6 mm screen size in hammer mill or base ingredients were added as whole grain in ration of 30 % whole grain 70 % ground material. In addition base ingredients were mixed with mineral and vitamin premix to make complete diets. Smaller particles improved pellet durability but replacement of ground ingredients with whole ingredinets increased hardness. Coarse structure of the diets reduced energy consumption when compared with fine structured diets. In experiment 2, pure wheat and barley were used as ingredients and were ground using either hammer mill fitted with 3 mm sieve or roller mill using 1. 5 mm gap between rolls. In addition, {{a combination of the}} hammer mill fitted with 3 mm <b>screen</b> and <b>roller</b> mill with the 1. 5 mm gap between rolls as a singular method was tested. Higher pellet durability and lower energy consumption was observed for wheat diets when compared to maize diets.

Larger proportion of the particles smaller than 1. 0 mm were found when diets were ground on a hammer mill fitted with 3 mm screen in comparison to hammer mill fitted with 6 mm screen (experiment 1) or roller mill with 1. 5 mm roller gap (experiment 2).

50|$|The Iron Plant Complex has 10 main {{production}} line units (the rest are auxiliary and back up units). Iron ores with large grains from Golgohar are converted by ball mills in the Pelletizing plant. After mixing with Chadermalou's smaller grains and bentonite in blending machines it is changed to pellets (diameter: 6-25 mm) and screened by a two-story <b>roller</b> <b>screen.</b> Pellets solidify in an induration tunnel or furnace at 1280 °C. The Lime Production Plant receives limestone from the Hozmahi mine, {{which is then}} calcinated in two rotary kilns at 780-1050 °C. After screening, calcinated lime {{may be used in}} the Lime Plant, consumed in the Palletizing Plant, Briquet Unit or for industrial water production. At the Direct Reduction plant, pellets are charged in Midrex shaft furnaces after misco-grain screening (less than 5mm). Two reducing gases (derived from cracking natural gas or methane, consisting of Co and H2) are injected into the furnace, combine with oxygen from the pellets resulting in CO2 + H2O. Without oxygen, pellets become sponge irons. After screening, sponge irons are transferred to the Steel Plant. Sponge irons with a diameter less than 5 mm go to the briquet unit to produce briquets (diameter above 25 mm). Then, they are transferred to the Steel Plant with the sponge iron.|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{furnaces}} with roller hearth have wide {{application in}} the steel industry. Typically, furnaces with roller hearth belong to the class of medium-temperature heat treatment furnaces, but {{can be used to}} heat the billets for rolling. In this case, the furnaces belong to the class of high temperature heating furnaces, and their efficiency depends significantly on the reliability of the roller hearth furnace. In the high temperature heating furnaces are used three types of watercooled shaft rollers, namely rollers without insulation, <b>rollers</b> with insulating <b>screens</b> placed between the barrel and the shaft, and rollers with bulk insulation. The definition of the operating conditions of rollers with water-cooled shaft greatly facilitates the choice of their design parameters when designing. In this regard, at the design stage of the furnace with roller hearth, {{it is important to have}} information about the temperature distribution in the body of the rollers at various operating conditions. The article presents the research results of the temperature field of the hearth rollers of metallurgical heating furnaces. Modeling of stationary heat exchange between the oven atmosphere and a surface of rollers, and between the cooling water and shaft was executed by finite elements method. Temperature fields in the water-cooled shaft rollers of various designs are explored. The water-cooled shaft rollers without isolation, <b>rollers</b> with <b>screen</b> and <b>rollers</b> with bulk insulation, placed between the barrel and the water-cooled shaft were investigated. Determined the change of the thermo-physic parameters of the coolant, the temperature change of water when flowing in a pipe and shaft, as well as the desired pressure to supply water with a specified flow rate. Heat transfer coefficients between the cooling water and the shaft were determined directly during the solution based on the specified boundary conditions. Found that the greatest heat losses occur in the rollers without insulation. Insulation (screens or bulk insulation) between the shaft and the barrel of roller allows reducing the cooling water losses. A comparative analysis of research results allowed us to find that operating conditions of the furnace rolls with screen insulation are more favorable in terms of thermal conditions and losses, than those of rollers without the insulation and rollers with the bulk insulation...|$|R
