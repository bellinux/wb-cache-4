5000|$|Identified IBD {{segments}} can be {{used for}} a wide range of purposes. As noted above the amount (length and number) of IBD sharing depends on the familial relationships between the tested individuals. Therefore, one application of IBD segment detection is to quantify relatedness. Measurement of relatedness {{can be used}} in forensic genetics, but can also increase information in genetic linkage mapping [...] and help to decrease bias by undocumented relationships in <b>standard</b> <b>association</b> studies.Another application of IBD is genotype imputation and haplotype phase inference. Long shared segments of IBD, which are broken up by short regions may be indicative for phasing errors.|$|E

But to support external displays, the eDP standard {{would have to be}} implemented on the standard DP protocol, which runs on top of the Thunderbolt standard. Other issues for the new standard remain similar to the factors of Thunderbolt 3: power consumption; cable lengths allowable (via either passive or active copper, or unpowered optical); any increased bandwidth or functionality in the associated USB-Type C interface protocol; and controller production availability.|$|E
50|$|In some styles, {{students}} wear white belts {{until they}} receive their first dan rank or black belt, while in others {{a range of}} colors are used for different kyū grades. The wearing of coloured belts is often associated with kyū ranks, particularly in modern martial arts such as karate and judo (where the practice originated). However, there is no <b>standard</b> <b>association</b> of belt colours with particular ranks and different schools and organizations assign colours independently; see Rank in Judo for examples of variation within an art. However, white is often the lowest ranked belt and brown is the highest kyū rank, and it is common to see the darker colors associated with the higher ranks, i.e., the closest to black belt.|$|E

50|$|Most modern diesel {{locomotives}} are now delivered equipped for MU operation, allowing a consist (set) of locomotives {{to be operated}} from one cab. Not all MU connections are standardized between manufacturers, thus limiting the types of locomotives {{that can be used}} together. However, in North America there is a high level of standardization between all railroads and manufacturers using the Association of American Railroads (AAR) system which allows any modern locomotive in North America to be connected to any other modern North American locomotive. In the United Kingdom several different incompatible MU systems are in use (and some locomotive classes were never fitted for MU working), but more modern {{diesel locomotives}} used on British railways use the <b>standard</b> <b>Association</b> of American Railroads system.|$|E
50|$|Using {{simulated}} data, Browning and Thompson {{showed that}} IBD mapping has higher power than association testing when multiple rare variants within a gene contribute to disease susceptibility. Via IBD mapping, genome-wide significant regions in isolated populations {{as well as}} outbred populations were found while <b>standard</b> <b>association</b> tests failed. Houwen et al. used IBD sharing to identify the chromosomal location of a gene responsible for benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis in an isolated fishing population. Kenny et al. also used an isolated population to fine-map a signal found by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of plasma plant sterol (PPS) levels, a surrogate measure of cholesterol absorption from the intestine. Francks et al. was able to identify a potential susceptibility locus for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with genotype data of case-control samples. Lin et al. found a genome-wide significant linkage signal in a dataset of multiple sclerosis patients. Letouzé et al. used IBD mapping to look for founder mutations in cancer samples.|$|E
