This analysis reveals that Norwegian university-level learners are in fact using lexical bundles in a largely native-like manner in terms of overall frequency and function, but also that certain areas continue to be problematic, owed mainly to their comparatively limited repertoir of bundles that express the writer s stance or contribute to the explicit ordering of discourse...|$|R
40|$|A primary {{objective}} of the International Space Station {{is to provide a}} premier facility for microgravity research. There are many disturbances on board the Station that can disturb the quality of the microgravity environment, including disturbances caused by both system and payload hardware. Disturbances within experiments themselves can also affect the quality of their own environment. The primary functions of the Bridgman Unidirectional Dendrites in Liquids Experiment (BUNDLE) are to melt, directionally solidify, and perform in-situ quench of metallic alloys, providing data to aid in understanding the effects of the microgravity environment on the characteristics of these processed metals. Quenching of the <b>samples</b> in the <b>BUNDLE</b> furnace is accomplished by rapidly introducing high pressure helium into the furnace chamber. This type of quench will induce sample vibrations which may be large enough to adversely affect sample quality. The {{primary objective}} of the test described in this presentation was to determine the acceleration imparted on the <b>BUNDLE</b> <b>sample</b> during helium quench. From this information, the science community can better assess whether this method of quench will allow them to obtain the data they need. Utilizing breadboard hardware, the sample quench sequence was conducted. Data was collected from accelerometers located on the breadboard hardware and inside the sample cartridge. The test data indicated that the maximum acceleration achieved by the sample was 0. 325 g, which is much higher than the desired microgravity (10 (exp - 6) g) environment. However, this acceleration level occurred over a time period of less than 0. 1 second. Because this time period is so short, there should be no detrimental effects to dendrite growth.

40|$|The main aims of my PhD {{research}} work {{have been the}} investigation of the redox, photophysical and electronic properties of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and their possible uses as functional substrates for the (electro) catalytic production of oxygen and as molecular connectors for Quantum-dot Molecular Automata. While for CNT many and diverse applications in electronics, in sensors and biosensors field, as a structural reinforcing in composite materials have long been proposed, the study of their properties as individual species has been for long a challenging task. CNT are in fact virtually insoluble in any solvent and, for years, most of the studies has been carried out on bulk <b>samples</b> (<b>bundles).</b> In Chapter 2 an appropriate description of carbon nanotubes is reported, about their production methods and the functionalization strategies for their solubilization. In Chapter 3 an extensive voltammetric and vis-NIR spectroelectrochemical investigation of true solutions of unfunctionalized individual single wall CNT (SWNT) is reported that permitted to determine {{for the first time the}} standard electrochemical potentials of reduction and oxidation as a function of the tube diameter of a large number of semiconducting SWNTs. We also established the Fermi energy and the exciton binding energy for individual tubes in solution and, from the linear correlation found between the potentials and the optical transition energies, one to calculate the redox potentials of SWNTs that are insufficiently abundant or absent in the samples. In Chapter 4 we report on very efficient and stable nano-structured, oxygen-evolving anodes (OEA) that were obtained by the assembly of an oxygen evolving polyoxometalate cluster, (a totally inorganic ruthenium catalyst) with a conducting bed of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). Here, MWCNT were effectively used as carrier of the polyoxometallate for the electrocatalytic production of oxygen and turned out to greatly increase both the efficiency and stability of the device avoiding the release of the catalysts. Our bioinspired electrode addresses the major challenge of artificial photosynthesis, i. e. efficient water oxidation, taking us closer to when we might power the planet with carbon-free fuels. In Chapter 5 a study on surface-active chiral bis-ferrocenes conveniently designed in order to act as prototypical units for molecular computing devices is reported. Preliminary electrochemical studies in liquid environment demonstrated the capability of such molecules to enter three indistinguishable oxidation states. Side chains introduction allowed to organize them in the form of self-assembled monolayers (SAM) onto a surface and to study the molecular and redox properties on solid substrates. Electrochemical studies on SAMs of these molecules confirmed their attitude to undergo fast (Nernstian) electron transfer processes generating, in the positive potential region, either the full oxidized Fc+-Fc+ or the partly oxidized Fc+-Fc species. Finally, in Chapter 6 we report on a preliminary electrochemical study of graphene solutions prepared according to an original procedure recently described in the literature. Graphene is the newly-born of carbon nanomaterials and is certainly bound to be among the most promising materials for the next nanoelectronic generation. ...|$|R
40|$|We use conducting-tip atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{to measure}} local electronic properties of single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) circuits on insulating substrates.

By finding points where the tip-sample current is zero, it is possible to measure the electrochemical potential within the circuit, again with nanometer resolution. Such measurements provide compelling evidence that nanotubes within a bundle have only weak electronic coupling.

The bending motions of the M 2 helices lead to a degree of dynamic narrowing of the pore in the region of the proposed hydrophobic gate. Calculations of Born energy profiles for various structures along the simulation trajectory suggest that the conformations of the M 2 <b>bundle</b> <b>sampled</b> correspond to a closed conformation of the channel. Principal components analyses (PCA) of each of the M 2 helices, and of the five-helix M 2 bundle, reveal concerted motions that may be relevant to channel function. Normal mode analyses using the anisotropic network model (ANM) reveal collective motions similar to those identified by PCA...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} {{states in}} isolated single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) {{have been considered}} as an ideal realization of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL). However, it remains unclear whether one-dimensional correlated states are realized under local environmental effects such as {{the formation of a}} bundle structure. Intertube effects originating from other adjacent SWCNTs within a bundle may drastically alter the one-dimensional correlated state. In order to test the validity of the TLL model in bundled SWCNTs, low-energy spin excitation is investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The NMR relaxation rate in bundled mixtures of metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs shows a power-law temperature dependence with a theoretically predicted exponent. This demonstrates that a TLL state with the same strength as that for effective Coulomb interactions is realized in a <b>bundled</b> <b>sample,</b> as in isolated SWCNTs. In bundled metallic SWCNTs, we found a power-law temperature dependence of the relaxation rate, but the magnitude of the relaxation rate is one order of magnitude smaller than that predicted by theory. Furthermore, we found an almost doubled magnitude of the Luttinger parameter. These results indicate suppressed spin excitations with reduced Coulomb interactions in bundled metallic SWCNTs, which are attributable to intertube interactions originating from adjacent metallic SWCNTs within a bundle. Our findings give direct evidence that bundling reduces the effective Coulomb interactions via intertube interactions within bundled metallic SWCNTs. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{inner ear}} {{has been shown}} to {{characterize}} an acoustic stimuli by transducing fluid motion in the inner ear to mechanical bending of stereocilia on the inner hair cells (IHCs). The excitation motion/energy transferred to an IHC is dependent on the frequency spectrum of the acoustic stimuli, and the spatial location of the IHC {{along the length of the}} basilar membrane (BM). Subsequently, the afferent auditory nerve fiber (ANF) <b>bundle</b> <b>samples</b> the encoded waveform in the IHCs by synapsing with them. In this work we focus on sampling of information by afferent ANFs from the IHCs, and show computationally that sampling at specific time instants is sufficient for decoding of time-varying acoustic spectrum embedded in the acoustic stimuli. The approach is based on sampling the signal at its zero-crossings and higher-order derivative zero-crossings. We show results of the approach on time-varying acoustic spectrum estimation from cricket call signal recording. The framework gives a time-domain and non-spatial processing perspective to auditory signal processing. The approach works on the full band signal, and is devoid of modeling any bandpass filtering mimicking the BM action. Instead, we motivate the approach from the perspective of event-triggered sampling by afferent ANFs on the stimuli encoded in the IHCs. Though the approach gives acoustic spectrum estimation but it is shallow on its complete understanding for plausible bio-mechanical replication with current mammalian auditory mechanics insights...|$|R
