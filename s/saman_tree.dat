50|$|During his 1799-1804 {{travels in}} the Americas, Alexander von Humboldt {{encountered}} a giant <b>saman</b> <b>tree</b> near Maracay, Venezuela. He measured {{the circumference of}} the parasol-shaped crown at 576 ft (about 180.8 m), its diameter was around 190 ft (about 59.6 m), on a trunk at 9 ft (about 2.8 m) in diameter and reaching just 60 ft (nearly 19 m) in height. Humboldt mentioned the tree {{was reported to have}} changed little since the Spanish colonization of Venezuela; he estimated it to be as old as the famous Canary Islands dragon tree (Dracaena draco) of Icod de los Vinos on Tenerife.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reverse of}} the note {{features}} a Albizia <b>saman</b> <b>tree,</b> which is characteristic {{to the region}} of Valle del Cauca, and also an image of Isaacs' house El Paraiso, which he purchased in 1854 and resided in during his adolescence. This side is predominantly purple and yellow, and also contains the logo of the Bank of the Republic. Two palm trees are also printed on the reverse, and behind them is a paragraph from María about the evening atmosphere in Valle del Cauca: Una tarde, tarde como las de mi país, engalanada con nubes de color violeta y lampos de oro pálido, bella como María, bella y transitoria como fue ésta para mí, ella, mi hermana y yo, sentados sobre la ancha piedra de la pendiente, desde donde veíamos a la derecha en la honda vega rodar las corrientes bulliciosas del río, y teniendo a nuestros pies el valle majestuoso y callado, leía yo el episodio de Atala, y las dos, admirables en su inmovilidad y abandono.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} isolated, mature Samanea <b>saman</b> <b>trees</b> on {{herbaceous}} production and species composition were investigated over the 1993 / 1994 growing season in a subhumid tropical grassland in north-east Queensland, Australia. Under the crown, the cumulative aboveground biomass over {{the season was}} almost 90 % above that of the open grassland. This increase {{was associated with a}} difference in species composition. The principal grass under the crown was Panicum maximum, while in the open grassland, the dominant species was Urochloa mosambicensis. Near the crown, cumulative biomass was intermediate and this was reflected in a mixed species composition. This study confirms earlier, largely anecdotal reports of the potential beneficial effects of S. saman on forage production, but by itself was unable to explain the mechanism by which this increase occurred...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>tree,</b> called <b>Samán</b> de Güere (transcribed Zamang del Guayre by von Humboldt) {{still stands}} today, {{and is a}} Venezuelan {{national}} treasure. Just like the dragon tree on Tenerife, {{the age of the}} saman in Venezuela is rather indeterminate. As von Humboldt's report makes clear, according to local tradition, it would be older than 500 years today, which is rather outstanding by the genus' standards. It is certain, however, the tree is quite more than 200 years old today, but it is one exceptional individual; even the well-learned von Humboldt could not believe it was actually the same species as the <b>saman</b> <b>trees</b> he knew from the greenhouses at Schönbrunn Castle. [...] A famous specimen called the [...] "Brahmaputra Rain Tree" [...] located at Guwahati {{on the banks of the}} Brahmaputra River in Assam, India has the thickest trunk of any Saman; approximately twelve feet (3.66 meters) diameter at breast height (DBH). | ...|$|R
40|$|Continuing on from {{previous}} work examining the {{mechanisms by which}} increases in the biomass of Panicum maximum might occur when growing under the canopy of mature Samanea <b>saman</b> <b>trees</b> (Durr and Rangel 2000), a further pot trial was undertaken. This applied a similar methodology of using soil collected from under {{and away from the}} canopy of trees and imposing variable light levels by shade cloths. A third variable was introduced, that of water stress, through varying the period of re-watering: every day, every 5 days and every 10 days. The major effect of water stress was to reduce the biomass. However, the degree of reduction was dependent upon the soil and the shade level, as there was relative compensation in grasses grown in the subcanopy-collected soil at intermediate shade levels due to an increase in the water use efficiency. This finding suggests that one of the major benefits of nutrient enrichment by trees in these environments acts via improved water utilisation and suggests a generalised explanation of why relative increases of grass biomass under the canopy of trees might occur in subhumid environments...|$|R

50|$|Mark Twain visited Waiohinu in 1866 and, {{legend has}} it, planted a monkey pod <b>tree</b> (Albizia <b>saman)</b> here. The <b>tree</b> blew down in 1957, but a shoot from it was replanted, and remains growing there today.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which increases in the biomass of Panicum maximum might occur when growing under the canopy of mature Samanea <b>saman</b> <b>trees</b> were investigated in a pot trial. The subcanopy environment was simulated using soil collected from under, near {{and away from the}} canopy of trees and variable light levels imposed by shade cloths. The soil from under the trees had a greatly enhanced nitrogen level, and gave a higher total dry weight (TDW) at all levels of shade than soil from outside the canopy. The increase in biomass was affected by level of shading, with a 200 % increase in full sunlight as compared with an increase of 100 % at the deepest shade level (12 % relative light). Deep shade augmented shoot nitrogen concentration, but caused only a slight increase in digestibility. The results show that, in the seasonal range of shade levels corresponding with those found beneath the canopy of S. saman (10 - 30 % relative light), there will be a steep gradient in response in TDW. Consequently, factors affecting canopy light transmission - such as the extent of leafing out and canopy shape - will be critical in determining yield response...|$|R
50|$|Albizia saman (sometimes treated {{under the}} {{obsolete}} name Samanea saman) is {{a species of}} flowering tree in the pea family, Fabaceae, that is native to the Neotropics. Its range extends from Mexico south to Peru and Brazil, {{but it has been}} widely introduced to South and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii. Common names include <b>saman,</b> rain <b>tree</b> and monkeypod (see also below). It is often placed in the genus Samanea, which by yet other authors is subsumed in Albizia entirely.|$|R
50|$|In the Bugle Rock park, {{in a study}} {{carried out}} by bat biologists, fruit bats (Pteropus giganteus) (also called Indian Flying-fox, listed as least-threatened in the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Chiroptera Specialist Group 1996) have been {{recorded}} in roost trees (Ficus sp., Mangifera indica (mango fruit <b>tree),</b> Samanea <b>saman</b> (rain <b>tree),</b> Eucalyptus sp., Glaycindia sp.), and also in Gulmohar (Delonix regia) and jackfruit tree (Artocarpus heterophyllus) in the garden, tree groups and protected areas with a roost size of 650-710. The roost trees, about 20-25 and generally 30 - 40 ft tall, are in the central area {{of the park and}} are 50-60 years old. The area is maintained by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA). The farmland, before roost, is stated to be undisturbed and ancient. The study has observed that there is need to conserve urban roosts of bats. It is recorded that the Police Commissionerate on Infantry Road, Bangalore has geared to preserve bats, which have nested in the trees in the Commiserate for many years.|$|R
40|$|The Spotted Owlet Athene brama is the commonest {{among the}} 62 species of owls of India {{and also a}} widely {{distributed}} bio-control agent of agricultural pests in India. We studied the roost site selection and diet composition of the Southern Spotted Owlet A. b. brama in the Cauvery Delta in southern India during 2007 - 08. The roost selection evaluated based on roost site characteristics observed from 22 roost sites revealed that the owlets preferred to roost closer to human habitation than in agricultural fields, with all the roosts found among <b>trees.</b> Albizia <b>saman</b> (Rain <b>Tree)</b> was {{the most commonly used}} roost tree species. Tree species with 20 - 30 m height and 1 - 3 m gbh were most preferred for roosting due to the presence of a greater number of branches. Roost species and size class selection appeared to depend on availability of suitable locations with better protection from weather and concealment to avoid disturbance from humans and other birds. Diet composition examined through analysis of 55 regurgitated pellets revealed that undigested food items from insects constituted the bulk of the owls diet (57 %) followed by mammals (rodents) (24. 4 %), reptiles (7. 8 %) and birds (7. 3 %). However, it is argued that mammals in the form of digestible parts could have contributed more to the diet of the owlet than any other taxa. Higher consumption of rodents and insects is discussed in the light of reducing agricultural pests; adequate roosting sites (mature trees) and creating awareness among the local community about the role of Spotted Owlets will improve their population and help control agricultural pests more effectively...|$|R
