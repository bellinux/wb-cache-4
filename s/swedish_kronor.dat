5|$|The most {{essential}} change {{consisted of a}} more monumental composition. The temple had been enlarged considerably and given a more stern shape, and the figures had been more closely assembled and they formed an unbroken relief-like row. The sketch was put on exhibition in the museum in November 1913 and {{in a letter to}} Ludvig Looström, the director of the museum, Larsson offered the painting for 35,000 <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronor.</b>|$|E
5|$|After this rejection, the {{painting}} was sold to a Swedish art collector who offered {{to sell it to}} the Museum of National Antiquities for 12 million <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronor.</b> This offer caused a controversy in which people debated if {{the painting}} belonged to Nationalmuseum or the Museum of National Antiquities. In this debate where there were exaggerations in both directions, people claimed that {{the painting was}} both an unsurpassed masterpiece of Swedish art and a work of suspect morality. In 1987, it was sold by Sotheby's in London to a Japanese art collector.|$|E
5|$|After {{the line}} had {{been relegated to}} a branch line, traffic fell considerably. Another factor was car traffic, which {{did not exist in}} Flekkefjord until 1918, but {{thereafter}} became widespread. After the war, Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line. During the 1940, several railcars of Class 87 were taken into use, and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units. From 1956 to 1966, also Class 86 units were used on the line, but the narrow profile of the tunnels made operations problematic. Class 87 remained in service until 1981, when used Class 89 units were bought from Sweden. At first, two Y7 units were brought to Norway on 23 January and taken into service on 24 February. After they proved to work well, NSB bought them for 95,000 <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronor</b> plus freight. Two more units were bought in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm moved inland, 700 civil defense {{personnel}} were deployed to the affected region; however, due to damaged roads and poor travel conditions, they struggled to reach isolated regions. The Nicaraguan army supplied relief crews with four helicopters and two AN-2 aircraft for damage surveillance and search-and-rescue missions {{in the wake of}} Ida. The government of Nicaragua allocated roughly $4.4million in relief funds for those affected by the storm. Several agencies from the United Nations provided residents affected by the storm with relief supplies and donated disaster funds to the country. The United Nations Population Fund provided $49,000 in funds; the World Food Programme deployed several rescue vehicles and logistics teams; UNICEF also provided logistics assistance in the country. OCHA provided $2million in relief funds; the Government of Sweden provided 400,000 <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronor</b> ($55,946USD) for sanitation and health supplies; the Netherlands Red Cross also donated 20,000 euros ($27,226USD) for non-food items.|$|E
25|$|The {{revenues}} from taxes were disappointing; for example, {{revenues from}} the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronor</b> per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronor</b> in any year and the average was closer to 50 million.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{evaluation}} of tenders for communal construction procurement. Each year the public procurement equals {{the value of}} millions of <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronors,</b> of which construction projects makes up a large proportion. These projects tend to often exceed their budgets. The aim with the thesis is to investigate if there are faults in the tender evaluation process. The theoretical framework for the study partly consists of a review on how the communal evaluation work is described in law and practice. A qualitative methodology is applied in the study where four procurement workers are interviewed. Similarities and differences between evaluation work in practice and what is described in the study's theoretical framework is been analyzed. One of several conclusions {{of the study is}} that the choice of contractual form for the construction work often determines the choice of procurement form. Hence the person that works with modeling of tender documents should be well acquainted with the construction industry. A boundary that was set for the study is that it geographically covers Sweden exclusively. Suggestions for further research include investigating why international construction companies bidding in Sweden on communal construction projects do not seem to function properly...|$|R
40|$|Background: Two new pneumococcal {{conjugate}} vaccines were {{licensed to}} immunize infants {{and young children}} against pneumococcal disease. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the expected health benefits, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness of routine vaccination with the 10 -valent pneumococcal nontypeable hemophilus influenza protein-D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) compared with the 13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 13) in Sweden. Methods: A Markov cohort model was used to estimate the effect of vaccination at vaccine steady state, taking a societal perspective and using a 2 + 1 vaccination schedule. Price parity was assumed between the vaccines. Outcomes were measured by reduction in disease burden, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Results: The results predicted that PCV 13 would prevent 3 additional cases of invasive pneumococcal disease and 34 additional cases of pneumonia, whereas PHiD-CV would avoid 3 additional cases of mastoiditis, 1010 tube insertions, and 10, 420 cases of ambulatory acute otitis media compared with PCV 13. By combining morbidity and mortality benefits of all clinical outcomes, PHiD-CV would generate 45. 3 additional QALYs compared with PCV 13 and generate savings of an estimated 62 million <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronors.</b> Conclusion: The present study predicted lower costs and better health outcome (QALYs) gained by introducing PHiD-CV compared with PCV 13 in routine vaccination. Our results indicated that PHiD-CV is cost-effective compared with PCV 13 in Sweden. (Clin Ther. 2012; 34 : 177 - 189) (C) 2012 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{conduct a}} {{cost-effectiveness}} study of nasal budesonide versus surgical {{treatment in the}} management of nasal polyps. Design and methods: A decision-tree model reflecting two different treatment strategies for nasal polyps in Sweden was developed. The first strategy was initial polypectomy, performed under three different sets of circumstances: inpatient functional endoscopic surgery, outpatient evulsion with sedation, or outpatient evulsion with local anaesthesia; all treatments were followed by intranasal treatment with budesonide (Rhinocort(R)) 128 mug twice daily. The second strategy was initial intranasal treatment with budesonide 128 mug twice daily. Perspective: Healthcare provider perspective. Outcome measures and results: After 1 month, treatment with nasal budesonide was classified as a success (82. 5 %) or a failure (17. 5 %) based on clinical study data. In cases of success, the treatment was continued, and in cases of failure, polypectomy was undertaken, followed by budesonide 128 mug twice daily. Treatments were evaluated after 4 months using prices from the Central Hospital in Skovde, Sweden. The expected reduction in cost from using initial nasal budesonide treatment compared with the different alternatives of polypectomy were 9760 <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronors</b> (SEK) for inpatient functional endoscopic surgery, SEK 2747 for outpatient evulsion with sedation, and SEK 672 for outpatient evulsion with anaesthesia (1998 values). Nasal budesonide 128 mug twice daily treatment for nasal polyps revealed a potential reduction in costs of 53 % compared with the primary surgery approach. Conclusion: Initial treatment of nasal polyps with nasal budesonide provides lower costs than treatment with initial polypectomy with maintained effectiveness.

25|$|Revenues vary {{according}} to tax rate, transactions covered, and tax effects on transactions. The Swedish experience with transaction taxes in 1984–91 demonstrates that the net effect on tax revenues {{can be difficult to}} estimate and can even be negative due to reduced trading volumes. Revenues from the transaction tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronor</b> per year but actually amounted to no more than 80 million <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronor</b> in any year. Reduced trading volumes also caused a reduction in capital gains tax revenue which entirely offset the transaction tax revenues.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) {{demonstrated}} that the bisphosphonate alendronate {{reduces the risk of}} hip, spine and wrist fracture in osteoporotic women by approximately one half. Objective: To use data from FIT to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of alendronate. Design: A Markov model was developed for a cohort of Swedish women, comparable in relative fracture risk to the women enrolled in the FIT vertebral fracture arm (i. e. age 71 years with low bone mass plus at least one prior spine fracture). The women in the model (with low bone mass and a previous spine fracture) were exposed to alendronate therapy and transitioned over time from a `well' health state to health states of `hip fracture', `spine fracture', `wrist fracture' or `death'. All costs were calculated in 2000 <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronors</b> (SEK). Time horizon: In the Markov model our base-case treatment duration was 5 years followed by a 5 -year period where the benefit declined linearly to 0. Results: We found that treating 71 -year-old osteoporotic women with a prior spine fracture with alendronate resulted in a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of SEK 76 000, which is well below the threshold for cost effectiveness of SEK 300 000. For women aged 65 years, the cost-effectiveness ratio increased to SEK 173 000 and for women aged 77 years, the cost-effectiveness ratio decreased to SEK 52 000. Conclusions: Treating older osteoporotic women with alendronate was more cost effective than treating younger women with osteoporosis, and treating osteoporotic women with prior spine fracture was more cost effective than treating osteoporotic women without prior spine fracture. However, the costs per QALY gained for all populations studied were below generally accepted thresholds for cost effectiveness.

25|$|Opposition to {{this new}} policy of armed {{neutrality}} was weak in that all major parties, such as the Conservatives, Agrarians and Liberal People's Party, supported the government's position. On a regular basis, beginning in 1936, the Swedish government requested increases in its defense budget to strengthen its military preparedness as the international situation continued to worsen. The actual military budget from 1936 to 1939 increased many times over. In 1936, military spending was $37,000,000; 1937, $50,000,000; 1938, $58,575,000; and in 1939 it was at $322,325,000. After the war began, military spending peaked in 1942 at $527,575,000 in one year alone. With the increased need of an expanded military, Swedish industry was required to not only supply the increased demand for domestic products, exacerbated by the German blockade of the North Sea, but also had to meet an increased demand in military armaments for the Swedish government. Before the war, production of armaments did not exceed more than {{tens of millions of}} <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronor,</b> but during the war, production exceeded the cost of one billion <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronor</b> ($240,000,000).|$|E

500|$|Alfred Nobel, in {{his last}} will and testament, stated that his wealth {{be used to create}} a series of prizes for those who confer the [...] "greatest benefit on mankind" [...] in the fields of physics, chemistry, peace, {{physiology}} or medicine, and literature. Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last one was written a year before he died and was signed at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895. Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31million <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronor</b> (US$198 million, Euro€176 million in 2016), to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes. Due to the level of skepticism surrounding the will, it was not until April 26, 1897 that it was approved by the Storting (Norwegian Parliament). The executors of his will were Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist, who formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organise the prizes.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} {{to complete the}} railway through to Boden sparked interest in Norrbotten {{among the members of}} the Swedish General Staff, and the chief, Axel Rappe, conducted a survey trip to the region in 1887. His report mentioned the changed strategic options due to the railway lines {{on both sides of the}} Gulf and a need for some kind of fortification in Boden, but he also toned down the earlier thoughts on the Russian interest in the Luleå–Narvik line. Rappe's report directly affected the future stretch of the railway line in Norrbotten. His recommendations, largely based on his and the General Staff's military planning, not to build the line along the coast, or build it all the way to the Swedish-Finnish border at Haparanda were later followed. The subsequent report completed in 1890 by the Neutrality Committee of 1888 (...) with Axel Rappe as one of its memberssuggested that a credible neutrality required an increased defence of the north-eastern border and proposed a budget of 1.3 million <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronor,</b> corresponding in today's money to around US$11 million (as of 2011), for the construction of permanent fortifications in Boden.|$|E
500|$|The Nobel Foundation {{was founded}} {{as a private}} {{organisation}} on 29 June 1900. [...] Its function is to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. In accordance with Nobel's will, the primary task of the Foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left. Robert and Ludvig Nobel {{were involved in the}} oil business in Azerbaijan, and according to Swedish historian E. Bargengren, who accessed the Nobel family archives, it was this [...] "decision to allow withdrawal of Alfred's money from Baku that became the decisive factor that enabled the Nobel Prizes to be established". Another important task of the Nobel Foundation is to market the prizes internationally and to oversee informal administration related to the prizes. The Foundation is not involved in the process of selecting the Nobel laureates. In many ways, the Nobel Foundation is similar to an investment company, in that it invests Nobel's money to create a solid funding base for the prizes and the administrative activities. The Nobel Foundation is exempt from all taxes in Sweden (since 1946) and from investment taxes in the United States (since 1953). Since the 1980s, the Foundation's investments have become more profitable and as of 31 December 2007, the assets controlled by the Nobel Foundation amounted to 3.628 billion <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronor</b> (c. US$560 million).|$|E

[...] It {{is one of the}} five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Norwegian Nobel Committee and awarded by a committee of five people elected by the Parliament of Norway. The first Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 1901 to Frédéric Passy and Henry Dunant; the prize was most recently awarded to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons in 2017. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma, and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, Passy and Dunant shared a Prize of 150,782 <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronor,</b> which was equal to 7,731,004 kronor in 2008. The Peace Prize is presented annually in Oslo, {{in the presence of the}} King of Norway, on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death, and is the only Nobel Prize not presented in Stockholm. Unlike the other prizes, the Peace Prize is occasionally awarded to an organisation (such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, a three-time recipient) rather than an individual.|$|E
