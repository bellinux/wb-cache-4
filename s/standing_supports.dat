She briefly met the Trinidadian-American activist Stokely Carmichael—the leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and a prominent figure in the Black Panther Party—after Belafonte invited him to one of Makeba's concerts; they met again in Conakry six years later. They entered a relationship, initially kept secret from all but their closest friends and family.

This paper describes the results of a questionnaire that was sent out to a purposive sample of seventy physiotherapists, designed to find out about current practice of the use of <b>standing</b> <b>supports.</b> The response rate was 80 %. The most commonly prescribed standing support provided prone and upright postures. The results showed conflicting assessment criteria for the use of a prone standing position. All of the therapists agreed that the choice of standing support was based on an assessment but the criteria varied. The mean age to start using a standing support was 13. 2 months (range 6 - 48 months). The reasons for using a standing support and what is hoped to be achieved were agreed by over 80 % of the therapists i. e. increased bone mineral density, reduction of contractures, maintenance of muscle length, experience of 'normal' standing position, for social reasons, for physiological benefits and for development of the hip joint. However muscle strength was a priority for only 64 % of physiotherapists when using this equipment. 55 % of physiotherapists believed that current <b>standing</b> <b>supports</b> meets the needs of the user and 30 % did not.

40|$|Tailgate {{stability}} within longwall {{coal mining}} {{is critical to}} longwall productivity and safety of mine personnel. A mechanistic model was developed and tested to explain observed high deformation tailgate behaviour characterised by lateral strata movement. Field investigations were conducted at three Australian longwall mines {{with an emphasis on}} the measurement of; horizontal strata movement about gateroads during longwall extraction, and the load/deformation characteristics of <b>standing</b> <b>supports.</b> 3 D numerical modelling was used to simulate tailgate deformation, and interaction of various support types and design strategies. The sensitivity of strata and support behaviour to; variations in roof geology, strength of sliding interfaces, depth of cover, pre-mining horizontal stress magnitude and orientation, and strength and stiffness characteristics of <b>standing</b> <b>supports</b> was modelled. Laboratory investigations of a standing support product, the &# 145;Can&# 146;, at reduced scale (one third) were conducted. The tests determined the loading mechanics of the product and provided a basis for optimisation of the engineering properties (strength and stiffness). Horizontal strata movement about longwall extraction was found to {{have a significant impact on}} strata behaviour at two of the three mines investigated. The term &# 145;skew roof&# 146; was coined to describe the deformation process. Essentially the roof strata was found to &# 145;skew&# 146; towards the approaching goaf. The key geotechnical factors found to control the skew roof mechanism were; magnitude and orientation of the pre-mining horizontal stress, presence of weak interfaces along which sliding could occur, and shear strength of the interfaces. Measurement of the nature and extent of skew roof deformation specific to each mine provided a sound engineering basis for support design. These included; the relative roles of long tendons versus standing support, optimal pattern (position across and along the roadway) of <b>standing</b> <b>supports,</b> and appropriate strength and stiffness characteristics. The findings were successfully implemented at Metropolitan Colliery in particular, where adequate tailgate serviceability has been achieved within a high deformation environment, and whilst maintaining a relatively small chain pillar width. The research has achieved an alternative to empirical and trial and error tailgate support design methods...|$|E

40|$|A {{critical}} {{safety component}} for all underground mining is intrinsic and standing support systems. Specifically, tabular hardrock mining exploits {{a wide variety}} of deposits that require various methodologies to safely mine the ore material. Several new support systems have been developed in recent years for hard rock applications which have been modified or applied in a variety of ground control applications. These include prestressing devices, improved cribs, and free <b>standing</b> <b>supports.</b> Various standing support and prop-type systems have been designed for hardrock applications with seismic loading conditions to accept prestressing. The prestressing, using water-filled cells, creates an active load upon installation and is considered essential to maintain support during and after the blasting of the mine faces. Heavy seismic activity is also present in these mines and the prestressing units can provide some energy absorption capability to help preserve the integrity of the support. This paper presents an overview of these innovations in support technology...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} project {{was commissioned by}} the Australian Coal Association Research Program (ACARP) to improve the understanding of tailgate strata mechanics {{and to provide a}} more rigorous engineering basis for tailgate support design. A deformation mechanism termed ‘skew roof’ was defined which relates the regional influence of differential horizontal strata movement (shear) about longwall extraction to gateroads. Confirmation of the mechanism was achieved by field investigations which included measurement of the shear displacement along weak interfaces. Under geological and mining conditions where the skew roof mechanism operated, strata units were found to move progressively further towards the goaf with height into the roof. 3 D numerical modelling was used to assess the major geotechnical factors controlling the mechanism and to determine appropriate support strategies within a ‘skew roof’ environment including the role of cables versus <b>standing</b> <b>supports.</b> The skew mechanism is considered relevant to; all roadways in the vicinity of longwall extraction including the faceline itself, chain pillar design, and support design...|$|E
40|$|Roof {{supports}} {{can only}} be understood {{in conjunction with the}} rock structure that they support. The strength of the rock depends on geology, and the loads are applied primarily by the in situ and mining-induced stresses. Other factors, such as wider spans and retreat or multiple-seam mining, can also reduce the stability of mine openings. Roof supports are used to help stabilize these openings, but their performance characteristics must be properly matched to the loading environment and ground behavior if they are to succeed. Roof supports include both intrinsic supports, such as roof bolts, and <b>standing</b> <b>supports.</b> The key characteristics of any support include its maximum load-carrying capacity, stiffness, and residual strength. Other important factors are the timing of installation, the stability of the support as it is loaded, and the capability of the support system to provide skin control.

40|$|A {{cooperative}} {{study was conducted}} with Emerald Coal Resources, L. P., an affiliate of Foundation Coal Corporation, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} (partially) pre-driven longwall recovery rooms supported with pumpable roof supports. This paper evaluates the load transfer mechanics associated with the advancement of the longwall face into the pre-driven recovery room and the widening of the room to recover the longwall shields. The results show that the yielding of the panel fender produced uncontrollable convergence that caused yielding of the shields and stiff pumpable roof supports when the face was approximately 10 ft from the recovery room. The shields continued to yield until the face advanced into the recovery room. Convergence in the pre-driven recovery room typically reached 6 - 8 in once the pumpable supports yielded and shed load through a declining residual load capacity prior to being cut out by the longwall shearer. Roof deformations occurred beyond the 32 -ft horizon with total deformation ranging from 2 to 4 in, indicating that <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> was necessary to help control the span as the longwall face advanced into the pre-driven recovery room. Stability improved as the pumpable supports were cut out, thereby reducing the span between the shields and the outby pillars. In the end, the shields were successfully recovered under stable ground conditions. However, a disconcerting discovery was the load shedding of the outby pillars as the recovery room was mined into. It is postulated that this may be due to the progression of the rear abutment moving toward the recovery room as the panel fender and <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> in the recovery room yield and shed load. This behavior was not expected with a relatively narrow room that is fully <b>supported</b> with <b>standing</b> <b>support.</b> If this mechanism is indeed occurring, the width of the room and performance of the <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> becomes even more critical. Premature failure of the support can lead to excessive convergence on the shield line that cannot be controlled even with modern shields, resulting in roof instabilities that can lead to catastrophic results...|$|R

The strength and deformation capability of these systems has been documented under both laboratory and field conditions.

A crib support system with low system stiffness may allow large amounts of closure and deformation and cause the bolting systems to yield or even fail. Conversely, cribs or standing support that are too stiff may experience brittle or buckling failures, negating the advantage of the intrinsic supports previously installed. Utilizing a combination of field measurements and 3 -dimensional finite element modeling techniques, the relationship between system stiffness and the subsequent performance of the installed bolting system is evaluated.

40|$|Reduction in the {{recovery}} time required and improvements in safety during a longwall face move have compelled coal mine operators to examine and use predriven longwall recovery rooms. The recovery entry is developed at the longwall stop position and supported ahead of time so that the required combinations of standing and internal supports can be installed before the longwall face approaches.

40|$|Longwall mines {{typically}} {{use some}} form of standing support for secondary roof support in longwall tailgate entries. Although {{there have been several}} new support products developed for this application, there remains no universal design criteria to optimize the application of these support technologies. The requirement for optimization and proper support selection is to understand the degree of control that the support has on the ground behavior. The ground reaction curve and numerical modeling was used to evaluate the impact of standing support on ground behavior. LaModel was used to evaluate the impact of standing support on main roof and floor behavior and pillar yielding. The conclusion drawn from this study was that <b>standing</b> <b>supports</b> do not have sufficient capacity to control main roof or floor loading or prevent the resulting convergence of the tailgate entry. However, it is imperative that this uncontrollable convergence be considered in the support design to prevent premature failure of the support. A FLAC model was used to evaluate the near-seam roof and floor behavior in conjunction with the global vertical and horizontal stresses. The model suggests that standing roof supports can have some impact on the ground behavior as the elastic response of the rock is exceeded and rock structure deteriorates from the stress concentrations that develop around the tailgate opening. During this phase, the capacity and stiffness of the standing support can be critical to the stability of the opening, as eventually the rock mass will be transformed into a partially detached structure whose weight must be supported by the standing support.

40|$|Longwall mining {{has gained}} the {{reputation}} {{as being the}} safest extraction method in underground coal mines. However, {{one of the most}} difficult tasks associated with longwall mining is moving the face once a panel is completed. Based on Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) fatality reports since 1996, longwall face recovery operations have claimed the lives of 5 U. S. miners and have resulted in numerous injuries. Recovery operations can be hazardous because they involve moving large pieces of equipment in very confined spaces. They are also conducted in highly stressed ground conditions due to front abutment loads generated by panel extraction. Shield removal is the most hazardous operation during face recovery because miners are constantly exposed to the unpredictable gob edge. To protect the miners, one or more walking shields, cribbing and/or other supplemental roof and <b>standing</b> <b>supports</b> are typically employed as breaker line supports as each shield is removed. At the Harris No. 1 Mine in southern WV, mobile roof supports (MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s) have been used in lieu of traditional walking shields on 17 face moves since 1997. MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s are shield-like support units mounted on crawler tracks and are commonly used during room-and-pillar retreat mining operations. For longwall recovery, the two biggest advantages that MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s have over traditional walking shields are that they are remotely controlled and are highly maneuverable. MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s have contributed to safer shield recovery and shorter move times at the Harris No. 1 Mine. This paper will address both the safety and the operational issues associated with MRS usage during shield recovery.

In response to these findings, a booklet, the “A-Z of Postural Care” was developed by a team of researchers, therapists, teachers and parents of children with a disability (Hutton et al., 2009). Aim The aim of this study was to develop and validate an outcome measure designed to assess teachers’ and parents’ understanding, and knowledge of postural care, together with their confidence in providing such care. This measure will be used in the evaluation of a training programme, based on the content of the ‘ A-Z of postural care’ as a before and after measure of parents and teachers understanding, knowledge and confidence of postural care. Method An initial list of questionnaire items was developed via discussions with occupational therapists, physiotherapists, parents and teachers, based on the content of the A-Z of postural care. Items were designed to assess knowledge and understanding of postural care for children with disabilities; two further subscales were included to assess, confidence and concerns in relation to providing postural care in the school and/or home environment. The outcome measure was then tested for validity and reliability on 152 participants. Participants were recruited from a range of professions and were divided in to two groups to enable a comparison of scores between an experienced/knowledgeable group (e. g., occupational therapists and physiotherapists) and a less experience/knowledgeable group (e. g., medical engineers, student physiotherapists, teachers). Results To assess the reliability of the scale we examined Cronbach’s Alpha (a measure of internal consistency) for each of the three subscales and for the total scale. Results indicate adequate reliability (>. 70) for all three subscales (Knowledge and Understanding: α =. 96; Confidence: α =. 92; Concerns: α =. 87) and for the total scale (α =. 82). Known groups validity analysis was also conducted to determine the validity of the measure. ‘Known groups’ expectation was defined as the experienced group showing statistically significant higher levels of knowledge, understanding and confidence, while also demonstrating lower levels of concerns compared to less experienced group. In line with expectations, the more experienced group had higher levels of knowledge and understanding (M = 65. 97 vs. M = 54. 45, p <. 001); and confidence (M = 77. 76 vs. M = 63. 64, p <. 001); and lower levels of concerns (M = 12. 81 vs. M = 15. 98, p<. 001) than the less experienced group. Conclusion These results suggest that the outcome measure known as the ‘postural care, understanding knowledge and confidence scale’ (PC-UKC), is a valid measure of understanding, knowledge and confidence when providing postural care. This measure will be used as a before and after measure of parents and teachers knowledge and confidence which will form part of a wider evaluation of a training programme, based on the content of the ‘A-Z of postural care’...|$|E

40|$|An {{underground}} {{investigation was}} designed and implemented by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of pre-driven longwall recovery rooms supported with pumpable concrete roof supports. The pumpable roof supports were instrumented with hydraulic pressure cells to measure support loading. Displacement of the support was also measured to assess the support reaction to ground movements. Movement up to 12. 5 m (40 ft) into the roof was measured with sonic probes and multipoint extensometers. Borehole pressure cells were installed in the panel fender and outby pillars to evaluate load transfer. Shield loading was also assessed to determine the impact of the panel fender yielding on face loading. The results show that the yielding of the panel fender produced uncontrollable convergence that caused yielding of the shields and stiff pumpable roof supports when the face was approximately 3. 12 m (10 ft) from the recovery room. The shields continued to yield until the face advanced into the recovery room. Convergence in the pre-driven recovery room typically reached 15 - 20 cm (6 - 8 inches) once the pumpable supports yielded and shed load through a declining residual load capacity prior to being cut out by the longwall shearer. Roof deformations occurred beyond the 10 m (32 ft) horizon with total deformation ranging from five to 10 cm (2 to 4 inches), indicating that <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> was necessary to help control the span as the longwall face advanced into the pre-driven recovery room. Stability improved as the pumpable supports were cut out, thereby reducing the span between the shields and the outby pillars. In the end, the shields were successfully recovered under stable ground conditions. However, a disconcerting discovery was the load shedding of the outby pillars as the recovery room was mined into.
