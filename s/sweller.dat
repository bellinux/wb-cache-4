[...] While some constructivists argue that [...] "learning by doing" [...] enhances learning, critics of this instructional strategy argue that little empirical evidence exists to support this statement given novice learners (Mayer, 2004; Kirschner, <b>Sweller,</b> and Clark, 2006). <b>Sweller</b> and his colleagues argue that novices do not possess the underlying mental models, or [...] "schemas" [...] necessary for [...] "learning by doing" [...] (e.g. <b>Sweller,</b> 1988). Indeed, Mayer (2004) reviewed the literature and found that fifty years of empirical data do not support using the constructivist teaching technique of pure discovery; in those situations requiring discovery, he argues for the use of guided discovery instead.|$|E

40|$|Over the ocean, the {{atmospheric}} turbulence can be significantly affected by <b>swell</b> waves. Change in {{the atmospheric}} turbulence affects the wind stress and atmospheric mixing over <b>swell</b> waves. In this study, {{the influence of}} <b>swell</b> on atmospheric mixing and wind stress is introduced into an atmosphere-wave-coupled regional climate model, separately and combined. The <b>swell</b> influence on atmospheric mixing is introduced into the atmospheric mixing length formula by adding a swell-induced contribution to the mixing. The <b>swell</b> influence on the wind stress under wind-following <b>swell,</b> moderate-range wind, and near-neutral and unstable stratification conditions is introduced by changing the roughness length. Five year simulation results indicate that adding the <b>swell</b> influence on atmospheric mixing has limited influence, only slightly increasing the near-surface wind speed; in contrast, adding the <b>swell</b> influence on wind stress reduces the near-surface wind speed. Introducing the wave influence roughness length has a larger influence than does adding the <b>swell</b> influence on mixing. Compared with measurements, adding the <b>swell</b> influence on both atmospheric mixing and wind stress gives the best model performance for the wind speed. The influence varies with wave characteristics for different sea basins. <b>Swell</b> occurs infrequently in the studied area, and one could expect more influence in high-swell-frequency areas (i. e., low-latitude ocean). We conclude that the influence of <b>swell</b> on atmospheric mixing and wind stress should be considered when developing climate models...|$|R

40|$|The {{change in}} shear {{strength}} of expansive soils {{with the amount}} of <b>swell</b> was experimentally investigated. Series of <b>swell</b> tests were carried out using a hydraulic triaxial stress path cell on expansive shale samples having different initial water contents and subjected to different confining pressures. The samples were sheared under strain controlled loading using a motorized screw control cylinder connected to the triaxial apparatus. For each value of confining pressure, five shear tests were performed. In the first test, the soil sample was sheared without allowing for <b>swell</b> to take place (i. e. 0 % <b>swell)</b> which is considered as a reference test. In the second test, shearing was conducted after the sample was allowed to <b>swell</b> until the vertical <b>swell</b> ceased (i. e. 100 % <b>swell).</b> In the third, fourth, and fifth tests, the samples were sheared when the vertical <b>swell</b> reached, respectively, 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % of the ultimate vertical <b>swell</b> measured in the second test. The ratios of the shear strength of the <b>swelled</b> samples to the shear strength of the sample in which no vertical <b>swell</b> was allowed were calculated. Test results have shown a significant influence of the amount of <b>swell</b> on the measured shear strength of the tested soil. In particular, the average value of the shear strength for samples allowed to reach ultimate vertical <b>swell</b> was only about 10 % of that for samples that were sheared before swelling.

(Ocean Dyn 64 : 1447 - 1456, 2014), this article presents significant waveheights of <b>swell</b> inverted from a 13 month dataset of two high-frequency (HF) phased array radars. As an important intermediate variable in the calculation of significant waveheights, relative <b>swell</b> directions obtained by two different methods from a single radar station are also presented. The impact of the inaccuracy of relative <b>swell</b> direction on the calculation of waveheight is investigated and an alternative way of using constant <b>swell</b> direction is proposed. Radar-inverted <b>swell</b> significant waveheights using different ranges of relative <b>swell</b> directions are investigated. Results are assessed by WAVEWATCH III model hind casts. Analysis of the complete database shows that radar-inverted <b>swell</b> significant waveheights agree reasonably well with model estimates with large scatter. Standard deviation {{of the difference between}} the two estimations increases with waveheight, whereas the relative standard deviation, normalized by waveheight, keeps nearly constant. The constant direction scheme of waveheight inversion gives good estimations except for energetic <b>swell</b> exceeding the small perturbation assumption. Statistical analysis suggests that radar measurement uncertainty explains a considerable part of the difference between radar and model estimates. <b>Swell</b> estimates from both radar stations are consistent. This enables combined use of both radar spectra at common radar cells. Use of double spectra solves the ambiguity of relative <b>swell</b> direction, i. e., absolute <b>swell</b> direction is obtained, and effectively improves the accuracy of <b>swell</b> direction by the least-squares method...|$|R
