50|$|In February 1982 Wallis formed Larry Wallis & The Death Commandos of Love with Johnny Reverb on guitar, Big George Webley on {{bass and}} Jim Toomey on drums. This line up was short lived and Wallis soon began playing a regular series of gigs, mostly at Dingwalls, {{with a line}} up {{completed}} by Duncan Sanderson, Andy Colquhoun and George Butler, This line up began life as 'The Police Cars', playing a Christmas gig as The Police Sleighs before using {{a large number of}} aliases such as The Pearl Divers Of Death, The Starry <b>Smoothounds,</b> The Knob Artists, The Death Commandoes of Love, The Donut Dunkers Of Death (as support to The Deviants - actually the same band with Mick Farren of vocals) before settling on the more permanent Love Pirates of Doom. This line up lasted up until the 1987 Pink Fairies reunion, though in '86 Sanderson was replaced by another bassist called Tony.|$|E
40|$|Portuguese {{commercial}} Elasmobranch landings were {{analysed for}} the period 1986 – 2009 and revealed that some species may be in danger of overfishing. Landings totalled 122, 515 mt, {{with an average of}} 5, 105 mt landed yearly, with captured sharks, skates and rays representing 8 orders, 14 families and 44 species. Annual landings for the fishery generally decreased over time, with a corresponding increase in price per kilogram. The most landed group, skates (Raja sp.), accounted for 33 % of the landings, or 40, 344 mt. They were followed by lesser spotted catsharks (Scyliorhinus sp.), Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), leafscale gulper sharks (Centrophorus squamosus), blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and gulper sharks (Centrophorus granulosus) (accounting for 12 %, 11 %, 10 %, 9 % and 8 % of the landings, respectively). In the absence of CPUE data, comparative trends of landings and price over time were used as an indicator of the status of specific Elasmobranch species. Centrophorus granulosus, <b>smoothounds</b> (Mustelus sp.), torpedo rays (Torpedo sp.), requiem sharks (Carcharhinus sp.) and angel sharks (Squatina sp.) displayed indications of possible over-exploitation, with significantly decreasing landings and increasing prices over time, and merit the focus of future research. The pattern shown by fishing effort over time (i. e. number of fishing vessels over time) displayed a marked decrease, although this was substantially less than the decrease shown by landings of the species mentioned earlier. It is therefore unlikely that such a decrease in landings is justified solely by a decrease in number of fishing vessels. Similarly, the increase in price shown for all species was largely superior to the increase in inflation, which would suggest that the increase in inflation alone would not account for the increase in price. All results and data corroborate the notion that some species are, in fact, over-exploited and in need of immediate management and conservation measurements. These findings were substantiated by min/max auto-correlation factor analysis (MAFA), which shows that the most important trend is that of a decrease in landings of those species where overfishing in indicated.

50|$|Moriscastle is {{very popular}} with shore anglers and is {{regularly}} used for competitions. One {{of the reasons for}} this spot's popularity is its ability to produce specimen-sized fish, include bass, tope, <b>smoothound,</b> bullhuss, dogfish, spurdog, ray, flounder and dab.|$|R
50|$|Blackwater is {{very close}} to Ballyconnigar beach, a site with one of the highest levels of erosion due to tidal forces. The stretch of beach from Ballyconnigar to Ballynaclash is popular for bathing, walking and fishing. Due to high volumes of beach users in the summer months, off season and night fishing is {{probably}} best advised. The ground south of where the Blackwater River enters the sea is very broken and does not seem to hold many fish. Species encountered outside this area include bullhuss, <b>smoothound,</b> tope, bass, ray, codling, eels and flounder.|$|R
50|$|The beach {{stretches}} {{for over}} 2 km and {{is surrounded by}} several holiday parks that offer permanent and seasonal holiday park accommodation. This region is very popular with anglers because {{of its ability to}} produce specimen-sized fish, include bass, tope, <b>smoothound,</b> bullhuss, dogfish, spurdog, ray, flounder and dab. Seals are also often seen swimming near the shore.The beach runs parallel to a wide, deep sand dune system which makes it an ideal beach for children to play. here are very attractive local amenities nearby that provide public conveniences, shops, take away food and free parking.|$|R
50|$|SharkDefense {{was formed}} in September 2001 by Eric Stroud and Jean Stroud. Its {{research}} program began at the Oak Ridge Shark Laboratory with a search for trace chemical messengers present in decayed shark tissue. In 1943, Burden et al. from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) had reported that decayed shark tissue was successful at halting feeding in captive dusky <b>smoothound</b> sharks (Mustelis canis). In the efforts to develop and test a chemical shark repellent package led by Dr. Harold Coolidge of the Harvard Museum, the WHOI team selected ammonium acetate as the active in the decomposing shark tissue, however, instrumental analysis by the Oak Ridge Shark Lab in 2002 failed to find ammonium acetate. It was hypothesized by SharkDefense that ammonium acetate was an approximation of the ammonium cation (based on the ammonia-like smell of the shark tissue or a urea-urease reaction), and the acetate conjugate base (based on the acetic acid which WHOI had already found to have repellent properties). After 2002, many new compounds were found and catalogued by SharkDefense, who maintains a repellent compound database.|$|R
