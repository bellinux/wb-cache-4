40|$|Using {{complementary}} behavioural {{and population}} ecological models, we explore {{the role of}} production risk, normal surplus and inter-annual food storage in the adaptations of societies dependent on seasonal agriculture. We find that (a) household-level, risk-sensitive adaption to unpredictable environmental variation in annual agricultural yields is a sufficient explanation for the origins of normal agrarian surplus and, consequently, of household-level incentives for inter-annual food storage; and, (b) at the population level, density-dependent Malthusian processes tightly constrain {{the circumstances under which}} this same mechanism can be effective in smoothing inter-annual fluctuations in household food availability. Greater environmental variation and higher levels of fixed set-asides such as seed requirements or transfer obligations to political authorities lead to more severe, periodic famines; however, outside of famine events, these same factors improve average population welfare by <b>suppressing</b> <b>population</b> density to levels at which Malthusian constraints have lessened impact.

The research was done to test the effectiveness of chitosan in suppressing aphid population growth, feeding preference and its ability in transmiting BCMV. Chitosan with concentration ranging of 0. 1 – 1. 0 % were applied on leaves using spraying method at 1 day before BCMV transmission. BCMV was transmitted by using 3 individuals of viruliferous aphids on each plant. Results show that chitosan treatments on leaves or plants significantly suppressed the population and feeding preferences of A. craccivora. Further, treated plants showed lower disease incidence, severity and BCMV titre significantly compared with untreated control plants. The positive effects of chitosan in <b>suppressing</b> <b>population</b> growth as feeding preferences and BCMV transmission might be due to the anti-feedant effect of chitosan on A. craccivora.

Its huge economic impact {{is due in part}} to the lack of specialised natural enemies <b>suppressing</b> <b>population</b> outbreaks in newly invaded areas. By establishing new associations, endemic parasitoid species native to the invaded areas can play an important role in controlling the pest. This study aims to provide a range of baseline information on the developmental parameters and parasitisation efficacy of three Italian populations of D. suzukii parasitoids at different temperatures. The species tested were a larval parasitoid, Leptopilina heterotoma (Thomson), and two pupal parasitoids, Pachycrepoideus vindemiae (Rondani) and Trichopria drosophilae (Perkins). Two comparative experiments were set up: the first assessing longevity and the lifetime fecundity of each species at 23 °C, and the second investigating the effect of temperature on parasitisation efficacy, developmental time and sex-ratio. The results revealed different fecundity patterns for the three parasitoids, probably due to a different level of synovigeny. For T. drosophilae and P. vindemiae, the lifetime sex ratio was biased towards an increasing number of males, whereas L. heterotoma showed the opposite trend. Moreover, temperature markedly affected host-parasitoid interaction and was positively correlated with the parasitoid's developmental time, whereas the sex-ratio was not significantly influenced. On the basis of these experiments, T. drosophilae appears to be the best candidate for developing a biological control strategy. </p...|$|E

Few experimental studies with wild grass—endophyte symbiota, compared to endophyte-infected agricultural grasses, have tested for anti-insect benefits, let alone for resistance against more than one insect species. This study quantified the preference and performance of the bird cherry oat-aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and the cereal leaf beetle, Oulema melanopus (L.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), two important pests of forage and cereal grasses, on Neotyphodium-infected (E+) and uninfected (E-) plants of the wild grass Alpine timothy, Phleum alpinum L.

Even at high {{population}} densities (300 – 2000 ind. 1 − 1), {{only one}} of five small cladoceran species (adult body length 3 ̆c 1 mm) significantly <b>suppressed</b> <b>population</b> growth of the rotifer Keratella cochlearis through interference (encounter) competition. At 500 ind. H, adults of D. ambigua (0. 96 mm body length) imposed an instantaneous per capita death rate of 0. 21 day− 1 on this rotifer. These short‐term experiments may have underestimated cladoceran interference because newborn rotifers were rarely present. 2. Newborn rotifers (3 ̆c 12 h old) were much more susceptible than adult rotifers (3 ̆e 24 h old) to interference from Ceriodaphnia dubia. All of the small cladoceran species tested were very much less likely than large Daphnia (body lengths 3 ̆e 1. 2 mm) to interfere with K. cochlearis, but perhaps at high population densities they could <b>suppress</b> <b>population</b> growth of susceptible rotifer species by damaging, and possibly eating, relatively small and soft‐bodied newborn individuals. 3. K. cochlearis of the tecta form, without a posterior spine, produced offspring of the typica form, with a posterior spine, {{in the presence of}} C. dubia. This developmental response is stimulated by at least several, and possibly all, cladocerans and probably reduces the susceptibility of the rotifer to cladoceran interference.

40|$|The toxic haptophyte Prymnesium parvum {{regularly}} forms fish-killing {{blooms in}} inland brackish water {{bodies in the}} south-central USA. Along the Texas coast smaller blooms have occurred in isolated areas. There {{appears to be an}} increasing risk that harmful P. parvum blooms will propagate into open coastal waters with implementation of future water plans. These plans will include increased interbasin water transfers from the Brazos River, regularly impacted by P. parvum blooms, to the San Jacinto-Brazos Coastal Basin, which ultimately flows into Galveston Bay (GB). Persisting source populations of P. parvum in inland waters elevates this risk. Thus, {{there is a need for}} an increased understanding of how P. parvum might perform in coastal waters, such as those found in GB. Here, two in-field experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of various plankton size-fractions of GB water on inoculated P. parvum during fall and winter, periods when blooms are typically initiating and developing inland. Stationary- and log-growth phase P. parvum were used to represent high and low toxicity initial conditions. Results revealed that P. parvum could grow in GB waters and cause acute mortality to silverside minnows (Menidia beryllina). Depending on season and growth phase, however, P. parvum growth and toxicity varied in different size fractions. During the fall, P. parvum inoculated from stationary-, but not log-growth phase culture, was negatively affected by bacteria-sized particles. During the winter, bacteria and nanoplankton together had a negative effect on P. parvum inoculated from stationary- and, to a lesser degree, log-growth phase cultures. Intermediate- and large-sized grazers when combined with bacteria and nanoplankton had complex relationships with inoculated P. parvum, sometimes stimulating and sometimes <b>suppressing</b> <b>population</b> growth. Toxicity to fish occurred in almost all plankton size fractions. The inclusion of progressively larger sized plankton fractions resulted in trends of decreased toxicity in treatments inoculated with stationary-, but not log-growth phase P. parvum in the fall. In the winter, however, inclusion of larger sized plankton fractions resulted in trends of increased toxicity to fish in treatments inoculated with both stationary- and log-growth phase P. parvum. This study indicates that understanding P. parvum population dynamics in open waters of estuaries and bays will be challenging, as there appears to be complex relationships with naturally occurring components of the plankton. The observations that P. parvum is able to grow to high population density and produce fish-killing levels of toxins underscores the need for advanced risk assessment studies, especially in light of water use plans that will result in P. parvum invasions of greater size...|$|E

Solarization for 3 {{weeks in the}} spring <b>suppressed</b> <b>population</b> levels of Belonolaimus longicaudatus, Criconemella spp., and Dolichodorus heterocephalus throughout the growing season on both crops at both sites. Levels of Meloidogyne incognita were <b>suppressed</b> initially, but <b>population</b> densities increased {{by the end of}} the crop in several cases. In one site, numbers of Paratrichodorus minor resurged following solarization to levels that were greater than those present in unsolarized control plots. The effect of solarization was not enhanced by combination with ammonium amendments, but, in one site, application of ammonium bicarbonate or ammonium sulfate resulted in lower numbers of B. longicaudatus than in the unamended control. Additional research and improved efficacy of candidate amendments are required before they can be successfully integrated with solarization for nematode management. Efficacy of solarization against plant-parasitic nematodes was achieved despite a relatively short (3 weeks) solarization period...|$|R
40|$|Virulence {{of three}} {{indigenous}} Iranian isolates of the fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch.) Sorokin (Deuteromycotina: Hyphomycetes), named DEMI 001, IRAN 715 C and IRAN 1018 C, were evaluated {{as well as}} their virulence and their ability to <b>suppress</b> <b>populations</b> of the granary weevil, Sitophilus granarius L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Five aqueous suspensions were prepared from each isolates, in a logarithmic series in Tween 80 (0. 05 % v/v). LT 50 values ranged from 5. 54 to 7. 9 days following immersion in aqueous suspensions. Lowest LC 50 on day 10 was 1 / 4 x 10 5 conidia mL - 1 for DEMI 001. Cumulative mortality 10 days after treatment varied from 9. 4 to 88. 88 % for IRAN 1018 C at low and high concentration, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Scientific note. An area-wide {{integrated}} {{pest management}} (AWPM) program began in the Hawaiian Islands in October, 1999 to demonstrate the feasibility of <b>suppressing</b> <b>populations</b> of three economically important species of fruit flies (oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), melon fly (Bactrocera curcurbitae (Coquillett), and Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata (Wiedmann)). Past concerns in Hawaii {{about the impact of}} fruit fly lures on nontarget species, especially endemic Hawaiian species, have prompted research on methyl eugenol and protein hydrolysate bait. The objective {{of this study was to}} collect, identify, and categorize field-collected nontarget arthropods captured in cue-lure baited bucket traps in the AWPM implementation sites. Attraction of nontarget species to cue-lure baited traps shows a need for future improvements in trap design...|$|R
50|$|Rotations on wetland rice in Florida {{is one of}} the options. Many of the {{nematodes}} {{that feed}} on sugarcane are able to feed on rice under dry conditions. However, because rice is normally grown in standing water, most of the nematodes are killed by the flooded conditions.Using oil cake from neem (Azadirachta indica), karanj (Pongamia pinnata), Indian mustard (Brassica juncea), polanga (Calophyllum inophyllum), groundnuts (Arachis hypogaea), mahua (Madhuca longifolia) and cotton (Gossypium sp.) could <b>suppress</b> <b>population</b> of P. zeae.Sugarcane grown in soil amended 6 months previously with sawdust, sugarcane trash, grass hay or lucerne hay had 78%, 61%, 96% and 92%, respectively, fewer lesion nematodes in roots than sugarcane growing in non-amended soil. Amendments with high C/N ratios are most effective.|$|R
