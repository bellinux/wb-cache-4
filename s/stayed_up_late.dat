5|$|Julian Carlton was a 31-year-old man {{who came}} {{to work as a}} chef and servant at Taliesin for the summer. Carlton was an Afro-Caribbean of West Indian descent, ostensibly from Barbados. He was {{recommended}} to Wright by John Vogelsong, Jr., the caterer for the Midway Gardens project. Carlton and his wife Gertrude had previously served in the house of Vogelsong's parents in Chicago. Originally a genial presence on the estate, Carlton grew increasingly paranoid. He <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>late</b> at night with a butcher knife, looking out the window. This behavior had been noticed by Wright and Borthwick, who issued an ad in a local paper for a replacement cook. Carlton was given notice that August 15, 1914 would be his last day in their employ.|$|E

500|$|The song {{talks about}} [...] "the perfect girlfriend who knows when to be refined {{and when to}} get wild". The song's refrain [...] "오빤 강남 스타일 (Oppan Gangnam style)" [...] has been {{translated}} as [...] "Big brother is Gangnam style", with Psy referring to himself. During an interview with The New York Times, Psy revealed that the Korean fans have huge expectations about his dancing, so he felt a lot of pressure. In order {{to keep up with}} expectations, he studied hard to find something new and <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>late</b> for about 30 nights {{to come up with the}} [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] dance. Along the way, he had tested various [...] "cheesy" [...] animal-inspired dance moves with his choreographer, including panda and kangaroo moves, before settling for the horse trot, which involves pretending to ride a horse, alternately holding the reins and spinning a lasso, and moving into a legs-shuffling side gallop.|$|E

500|$|The 22-year-old Gibson was a {{passenger}} aboard Titanics maiden voyage, joining the ship at Cherbourg in France {{on the evening}} of April 10. She had been on vacation in Europe with her mother when her employers, the Eclair Film Company, recalled her to New York City to participate in a new production. On the evening of the sinking, she was playing bridge (this would have been bridge whist, a predecessor to today's game) in a first-class saloon before retiring to the cabin that she shared with her mother. The game was later credited with saving the lives of the players who had <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>late</b> to finish it, despite it being (as one American writer put it) [...] "a violation of the strict Sabbath rules of English vessels." [...] The collision with the iceberg at 11:40 pm sounded to Gibson like a [...] "long, drawn, sickening scrunch". After going to investigate, she fetched her mother when she saw Titanics deck beginning to list as water flooded into the ship's boiler rooms.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1890, Campau {{was named}} player-manager. [...] In late July, team owner Chris von der Ahe praised Campau as [...] "the best captain I have ever had", [...] "a general {{on the field}} and a gentleman off of it." [...] Camapu {{compiled}} a 27-14 record as the team's manager but was stripped of the title in late August. [...] According to an account published at the time in the Sporting Life, Campau took seriously his responsibility to look after the players while they were off the field. [...] He <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>late,</b> watching over the club, and fined several players heavily for violations of the rules. [...] The fines caused dissent, and ultimately Campau's [...] "resignation was asked for, more to make peace in the family than anything else." [...] At least one baseball writer perceived the unfairness of von der Ahe's removing Campau for enforcing rules established by von der Ahe: [...] "There is gratitude for you. Von der Ahe tells his manager to do certain things and because he does it he is humiliated by being removed and a more 'agreeable' man put in his place. I know Charley Campau, and a bigger-hearted or more honorable man never lived." ...|$|E

They too are said to be earthly paradises in soil, climate, productions; and yet no English care to settle there, nor even to go thither for health, though the voyage from Lisbon is but a short one, and our own mail steamers, were it made worth their while, could as easily touch at Terceira now as they did a few years since.|$|E
60|$|Jorth rode {{off every}} day, {{sometimes}} {{with one or}} two of the men, often with a larger number. If he spoke of such trips to Ellen it was to give an impression of visiting the ranches of his neighbors or the various sheep camps. Often he did not return the day he left. When he did get back he smelled of rum and appeared heavy from need of sleep. His horses were always dust and sweat covered. During his absences Ellen fell victim to anxious dread until he returned. Daily he grew darker and more haggard of face, more obsessed by some impending fate. Often he <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>late,</b> haranguing with the men in the dim-lit cabin, where they drank and smoked, but seldom gambled any more. When the men did not gamble something immediate and perturbing was on their minds. Ellen had not yet lowered herself to the deceit and suspicion of eavesdropping, but she realized that there was a climax approaching in which she would deliberately do so.|$|E

60|$|It {{was never}} easy to detect {{expressions}} of feeling or spirits on his massive face, {{and he could}} hardly be more silent than usual; but it was noticeable that he never fell asleep after his former wont when sitting still. Indeed, he seldom was still, for {{he had a great}} deal of business both for the estate and the potteries on his hands, and <b>stayed</b> <b>up</b> <b>late</b> at night over them; and not only over them, for my room was next to his, and I heard the regular tramp, tramp of his feet, and the turn at the end of the room, as he walked up and down for at least an hour when the rest of the house were asleep, or the closing of the door when he returned from wandering on the moor at night. And in the early morning, long before light, he always walked or rode over to Arked House, bestowed on Dermot's hurts the cares which both had come to look on as essential, and stayed with him till the family were nearly ready to appear at their nine o'clock breakfast, not seeing Viola at all, unless any special cause led to a meeting later in the day, and then his eyes glowed, and he would do her devoted, unobserved service--no, not unobserved by her, whom it made blush and sparkle--and utter little words of thanks, not so gay as of old, but deeper, as if for a great honour and delight. And then he would bow his head, colour, and draw into the background, where, with folded arms, he could watch her.|$|E
