50|$|The {{production}} of clear vinyl <b>slipcovers,</b> however, {{is not as}} great {{as it used to}} be.

[...] ad campaign, and the word [...] "BOЯAT" [...] appearing to be crudely written in marker with the [...] "R" [...] written backwards.

Even the Fox in-cover advertising is written in broken English that appears poorly printed, indicating that there are [...] "More movie discs available from US" [...] and [...] "Also legal to own in Kazakhstan".|$|E
