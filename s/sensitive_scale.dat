40|$|To {{identify}} the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>scale</b> {{for use in}} clinical trials on multiple system atrophy (MSA), a short and <b>sensitive</b> <b>scale</b> is needed for MSA clinical trials. Potential candidates are the Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS), Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), MSA Health-Related Quality of Life scale (MSA-QoL), and Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic questionnaire (SCOPA-AUT). We enrolled patients with MSA from eight hospitals in Hokkaido, Japan. Board-certified neurologists assessed each patient at 6 -month intervals and scored them on the UMSARS, SARA, BBS, MSA-QoL, and SCOPA-AUT. Score changes were evaluated using the standardized response mean (SRM). The correlation between disease duration and each score was examined. The first evaluation was conducted on 85 patients (60 patients with MSA cerebellar ataxia dominant subtype [MSA-C] and 25 patients with MSA Parkinsonism-dominant subtype [MSA-P]). Sixty-nine patients were examined after 6  months and 63 patients after 12  months. The UMSARS Part 4 had the largest SRM after 6  months and the SARA after 12  months. SRMs for MSA-P, the shorter duration group, and the early-onset group were larger than were those for MSA-C, the longer duration group, and the late-onset group. SRMs for items regarding skilled hand activities, walking, and standing were relatively large. Our study indicates that the UMSARS (parts 2 and 4), SARA, and BBS are sensitive scales for evaluating MSA progression over 12  months.

Study Design: Laboratory analysis was carried out using <b>sensitive</b> <b>scale</b> and Vernier calipers. Place and Duration of Study: Teaching and Research Farm, Department of Animal Production and Health Sciences, Ekiti State University, between September 2013 and December, 2013. Methodology: The quails were housed in the cage at the ratio of 1 male: 3 females. Freshly laid eggs were collected and taken to the laboratory for external and internal analysis. Egg weight was taken with <b>sensitive</b> <b>scale,</b> while egg length and egg width were taken with Vernier calipers. Thereafter, the eggs were broken at equatorial region and the contents poured into a dish. Subsequently, egg yolk weight, length and width, albumen length and width were measured, while albumen weight was obtained by subtracting the addition of yolk weight and shell weight from egg weight. Results: Results revealed that egg weight has no significant phenotypic correlation with egg width, egg length, shell weight and shell thickness (P> 0. 05). With regard to internal egg quality traits, albumen weight was found statistically insignificantly correlated with all internal qualities including Haugh unit. In the case of albumen height, positive and highly significant phenotypic correlation was recorded with Haugh unit. The implication is that albumen height is a good determinant of Haugh unit. The higher the value, the higher the Haugh unit score, and the better the quality of an egg. However, the trait has negative and significant phenotypic correlation with albumen width, yolk weight and yolk width. In addition, egg weight has positive statistically significant phenotypic correlation with albumen and yolk indices (P= 0. 01). Conclusion: The size of an egg determines its albumen and yolk proportions. Egg weight therefore, is a good determinant of albumen weight and yolk weight in quail bird...|$|E

30|$|An {{enhancement}} in rate of TEC change index (ROTI) {{derived from}} GPS-TEC data was also observed around Yamagawa after 1700 UT (NICT). ROTI {{is a standard}} deviation of time differential TEC in 5 min, often used as the ionospheric irregularity index with a scale size of several tens of kilometers in plasma bubble structures (Nishioka et al. 2008). The ROTI enhancement disappeared before 2000 UT, different from the spread-F signatures in ionosondes. We speculate that this difference is not due to the difference of <b>sensitive</b> <b>scale</b> sizes between ROTI and ionosondes but due to the difference of physical parameters that cause spread-F and GPS ROTI. ROTI is the standard deviation of TEC variations for time scales of 30 to 300 s. If the horizontal drift speed of ionospheric plasma is 100 m/s, this time scale gives the horizontal plasma structures with scale sizes of 3 to 30 km, which can also cause spread-F in the ionosonde signal. However, since ROTI is the variation of the TEC, it would be less sensitive to the bottomside variation of the ionosphere measured as spread-F.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Interest in {{studying}} swallowing disorders {{in patients with}} altered consciousness has increased over the past decade. Swallowing deficit is frequently encountered in severe brain-injured patients. STATE OF ART: Results of studies have highlighted different {{factors such as the}} delay between the injury and the treatment and the level of consciousness of these patients, as well as the presence or not of tracheotomy, which will determine the feasibility of resuming oral feeding. Nowadays, very few valid and <b>sensitive</b> <b>scales</b> can be used to assess swallowing deficit in patients with disorders of consciousness. The Facial Oral Tract Therapy (FOTT) scale is an inter-professional multidisciplinary approach offering a structured way to evaluate and treat patients with swallowing disorders. In contrast with other scales, patients do not have to follow verbal instructions for the FOTT. PERSPECTIVES: This paper presents a review of existing literature on the assessment and management of swallowing disorders in patients with altered state of consciousness, and a description of the FOTT method. CONCLUSION: The FOTT seems to be an interesting assessment and rehabilitation tool for patients with disorders of consciousness. However, clinical studies are needed to confirm the validity and sensitivity of this technique...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the impact of {{acculturation}} and gender role attitudes on marital enqing and marital satisfaction among Chinese individuals living in the United States. The study hypothesized that marital enqing is positively associated with marital satisfaction. The study also hypothesized that acculturation and gender role beliefs are factors that influence marital enqing and marital satisfaction among Chinese individuals in the United States. The hypotheses were examined with 146 Chinese individuals by using Pearson’s correlation and multiple regressions. Results indicated that there was a positive correlation between marital enqing and marital satisfaction, and marital enqing and marital satisfaction were closely related, but they were not the same concept. Another result showed that acculturation to the European American culture was a significant predictor of marital satisfaction. Overall, the study highlights that acculturation is an important factor influencing relationship satisfaction among Chinese individuals in the United States. The results from this study point to important clinical implications and future research regarding the importance of using a culturally <b>sensitive</b> <b>scale</b> to assess marital satisfaction among Chinese individuals and evaluating the role of acculturation when examining the marital satisfaction among Chinese couples. ...|$|E
30|$|With {{respect to}} one item of the {{extrinsic}} scale, differences in country specific working {{conditions of the}} teaching profession turned out to constitute bias. This seems to be another important characteristic to consider in comparative research in addition to culture-specific meaning of a construct, response styles or translation errors {{when it comes to}} the comparability of results. Current international large-scale assessments attempt to collect data on a “common core” of all countries participating—in achievement as well as in opportunities to learn or context conditions. The IEA has a systematic approach to ensure this. All items that go onto the instruments are consensually agreed upon by representatives from all participating countries. There are, for example, also curriculum-test matching questionnaires that a representative from each country fills out, indicating whether an item is or is not on the country’s curriculum (Hencke et al. 2009). Nevertheless, cross-country comparability of the assessed data must be ensured before comparing results, this is especially required if a culturally <b>sensitive</b> <b>scale</b> is constructed based on the data. Our study does not support cross-country comparability with respect to working conditions of teachers with the result that certain aspects of job motivation are not part of a construct in single countries from an empirical perspective.|$|E

Research design: Multi-centric prospective study. Method and procedures: To test concurrent validity and diagnostic sensitivity, the four behavioural scales were administered in a randomized order in 77 vegetative and minimally conscious patients. Twenty-four clinicians with different professional backgrounds, levels of expertise and CRS-R experience were recruited to assess inter-rater agreement. Main outcomes and results: Good concurrent validity was obtained between the CRS-R and the three other standardized behavioural scales. Inter-rater reliability for the CRS-R total score and sub-scores was good, indicating that the scale yields reproducible findings across examiners and does not appear to be systematically biased by profession, level of expertise or CRS-R experience. Finally, the CRS-R demonstrated a significantly higher sensitivity to detect MCS patients, as compared to the GCS, the FOUR and the WHIM.

Methods: In this {{cross-sectional}} study, {{a convenience sample of}} 160 patients with type 2 diabetes, registered with the Charity Foundation for Special Diseases′ team-focused diabetes clinic, were recruited (response rate= 83. 7 %; n= 134). Participants older than 18 years who had active medical files in the system completed the questionnaire. Content validity was established using translation and back-translation procedures, pilot testing of the instrument, and getting views of the expert panel. Construct validity was determined using explanatory factor analysis. Internal consistency was ascertained using Cronbach′s alpha. The stability was confirmed using intra-class correlation coefficients. Results: Using exploratory factor analysis, a five-factor model emerged, which explained 75. 24 % of the total variance. Internal consistency reliability was sufficient (α= 0. 70; range= 0. 66 - 0. 87). The intra-class correlation coefficient was 0. 74 - 0. 81 for individual items.
