50|$|In {{the vortex}} {{separation}} process {{a mixture of}} uranium hexafluoride gas and hydrogen is injected tangentially into a tube at one end through nozzles or holes, at velocities close to the speed of sound. The tube tapers to a small exit aperture at one or both ends. This tangential injection of gas results in a spiral or vortex motion within the tube, and two gas streams are withdrawn {{at opposite ends of}} the vortex tube; centrifugal force providing the isotopic separation. The spiral swirling flow decays downstream of the feed inlet due to friction at the tube wall. Consequently, the inside diameter of the tube is typically tapered to reduce decay in the swirling flow velocity. This process is characterized by a <b>separating</b> <b>element</b> with a very small stage cut (the ratio of product flow to feed flow) of about 1/20, and high process-operating pressures.|$|E
5000|$|With {{a simple}} {{recording}} method, two microphones are placed 18 cm (7") apart {{facing away from}} each other. This method will not create a real binaural recording. The distance and placement roughly approximates the position of an average human's ear canals, {{but that is not}} all that is needed. More elaborate techniques exist in pre-packaged forms. A typical binaural recording unit has two high-fidelity microphones mounted in a dummy head, inset in ear-shaped molds to fully capture all of the audio frequency adjustments (known as head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) in the psychoacoustic research community) that happen naturally as sound wraps around the human head and is [...] "shaped" [...] by the form of the outer and inner ear. The Neumann KU-81, and KU-100 are the most commonly used binaural packages, especially by musicians. A simplified version of binaural recordings can be achieved using microphones with a <b>separating</b> <b>element,</b> like the Jecklin Disk. Not all cues required for exact localization of the sound sources can be preserved this way, but it also works well for loudspeaker reproduction.|$|E

40|$|Electronic drum {{machines}} need algorithms to {{help them}} produce &quot; rhythmic phrases. In [Bilmes, 1992], I claim that three perceptually <b>separate</b> <b>elements</b> characterize percussive rhythm: metric content, tempo variation, and deviations (formerly called event-shifts). Herein, I demonstrate that algorithms based on this model may considerably facilitate reproduction of expressive rhythm. I describe one such algorithm which extracts the <b>separate</b> <b>elements</b> from a percussive performance. The performance is then resynthesized {{with varying degrees of}} tempo variation and deviations. Without the deviations, the performance sounds mechanical. With them it sounds rich and alive. Consequently, I claim that we should begin a concentrated study on the <b>separate</b> <b>elements</b> characterizing percussive rhythm, particularly deviations. To this e ect, development has begun on a graphical drum machine program with which deviations may be explored. ...|$|R

40|$|Basic {{dimensions}} (length, {{width and}} thickness), critical velocity of transporting seeds, sliding friction angle {{and the mass}} of pumpkin seeds, obtained from four fruit of various mass were determined.

40|$|The blade {{cutting of}} thin layered shell {{involves}} three small geometrical scales, {{the scale of}} layer thicknesses, the scale of blade radius of curvature, the scale of fracture and delamination process zones, which need be resolved when a numerical simulation is carried out {{by means of a}} finite element discretization. Large deformations, material nonlinearity, contact, crack propagation and delamination make the problem highly nonlinear, so that an explicit dynamics approach based on the use of solid-shell elements is adopted to avoid convergence problems. A selective mass scaling technique [1, 2] is developed to overcome the critical time step limitation, dictated by the layers thickness. The prescribed blade trajectory drives crack propagation, so {{that it is possible to}} adjust the mesh with element edges along the expected crack path. To model crack propagation accounting for the interaction between the sharp blade and the cohesive process zone, special “directional cohesive elements” [3] are placed between <b>separating</b> <b>element</b> edges. Crack propagation and delamination can be characterized by very small process zone sizes, depending on the type of material and on the layer thickness. Discretizations that are coarse with respect to these lengths may give rise to spurious oscillations and accuracy loss. Techniques for the mitigation of these problems are investigated. Numerical applications to engineering problems are used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed simulation approach...|$|E

40|$|The 2015 {{edition of}} the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) {{specifies}} sound insulation requirements between dwelling units in terms of Apparent Sound Transmission Class (ASTC). The ASTC includes both the direct sound transmission through the <b>separating</b> <b>element</b> between adjacent rooms {{as well as the}} sound transmission via flanking paths. One of the ways to establish compliance with the NBCC involves a calculation procedure based on ISO 15712 - 1, in which the flanking sound transmission is predicted from the measured sound transmission through individual building elements combined with the attenuation at their junction. The calculation can be performed in third-octave bands (2 ̆ 01 cDetailed Method 2 ̆ 01 d) or using single-number ratings such as the STC (2 ̆ 01 cSimplified Method 2 ̆ 01 d). This presentation will describe the two calculation procedures, before focusing on the differences between. In extended studies at the National Research Council Canada, {{it was found that the}} simplified method sometimes leads to misleading results. An alternative method for calculating the ASTC of walls with linings was proposed, which ensures that the simplified method yields more conservative results than the detailed method. To achieve the best possible estimate of the sound insulation performance of buildings systems with linings, the detailed method should be used. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|My {{graduation}} {{project was}} about the design of “The house of wine” in Santorini. The project consists in designing a winery on the exact same location where old quarries once {{were placed on the}} outskirts of the village Oia, situated north of the Greek island Santorini. The quarries, a cultural landscape, are positioned right next to the town Oia having a big height-difference and as a consequence, they strongly demark a boundary between the town and the remaining surroundings. This separation has a strong impact on the local landscape and for this reason I wanted to explore the ways a boundary can be transformed from a <b>separating</b> <b>element</b> to a connecting one; explore the boundary as an architectural concept. The attention is focused on ways that a landscape of great importance can be treated and even preserved. Mass, corrosion, void, diversity, imperfection, contrasts. All these, are archetypal types that can be read and found in the island of Santorini. How does a contemporary intervention stand next to them? How does it become part of them? My answer is not based on the form and only the form. New materials are introduced, such as corten steel, contemporary ways of construction are used, but always having as a solid foundation the knowledge that I have acquired from the local way of constructing. The sculpting of the mass - which also refers to the local technique of cave houses – a process that happens from outside to inside can be parallelized with the traditional way of constructing, but using different methods and tools.

The effect on the sound insulation between the rooms produced by this layer of sand placed between the floor construction and the tiling is that of a cushioning layer, and demonstrates that this type of structure acts as a floating floor.
