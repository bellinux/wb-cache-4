50|$|The {{models for}} graphyne {{show that it}} has the {{potential}} for Dirac cones on its double and triple bonded carbon atoms. Due to the Dirac cones, there is a single point in the Fermi level where the conduction and valence bands meet in a linear fashion. The advantage of this scheme is that electrons behave as if they have no mass, resulting in energies that are proportional to the momentum of the electrons. Like in graphene, hexagonal graphyne has electric properties that are direction independent. However, due to the symmetry of the proposed rectangular 6,6,12-graphyne the electric properties would change along different directions in the plane of the material. This unique feature of its symmetry allows graphyne to self-dope meaning that it has two different Dirac cones lying slightly above and below the Fermi level. The <b>self-doping</b> effect of 6,6,12-graphyne can be effectively tuned by applying in-plane external strain.Graphyne samples synthesized to date have shown a melting point of 250-300 °C, low reactivity in decomposition reactions with oxygen, heat and light.|$|E

40|$|Certain polydiene rubbers can be doped by iodine {{to become}} {{electrically}} conducting. In particular, the conductivity of trans- 1, 4 -polybutadiene {{can be increased}} by 8 orders of magnitude upon conjugation and <b>self-doping</b> by iodine at room temperature, whereas cis- 1, 4 -polybutadiene cannot be made conducting by reaction with iodine under the same conditions. cis- 1, 4 -Polybutadiene, however, can be converted into the trans-isomer by UV irradiation. On {{the basis of these}} previous findings, we have developed a simple and selective method for the photochemical generation of conducting patterns in a nonconducting (iodinated) cis- 1, 4 -polybutadiene matrix. This was done by microlithographically patterned photoisomerization of cis- 1, 4 -polybutadiene films followed by I 2 -induced conjugation and <b>self-doping</b> of the UV exposed regions. The conducting patterns thus produced have remained stable for 10 months to date. They are colored and show strong fluorescence emission, which enables visualization of the conducting polymer regions. This facile method of conducting pattern generation could make polybutadiene attractive for microelectronic applications...|$|E
40|$|Poly(1 -amino- 2 -naphthol- 4 -sulfonic acid) and its {{copolymers}} with aniline are a {{new class}} of conducting polymers which can acquire intrinsic protonic doping ability, leading to the formation of highly soluble <b>self-doped</b> homopolymers and copolymers. Free [BOND]OH and [BOND]NH 2 groups in the polymer chain can combine with other functional groups that could be present in protective paints which can thus be successfully used as antistatic materials...|$|R
40|$|During {{exposure}} to synchrotron radiation, closo 1, 7 -dicarbadodecaborane (metacarborane) and closo 1, 2 -dicarbadodecaborane (orthocarborane) decompose, and {{are accompanied by}} increasingly evident photoemission surface photovoltage effects. We show that metacarborane and orthocarborane form <b>self-doped</b> n-type and p-type boron-carbides, respectively. Surface photovoltage effects dominate the photoemission final state, not the changes in electronic structure due to decomposition. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.

40|$|International audienceTiO 2 nanocrystals {{are widely}} used as {{semiconductor}} photocatalysts, despite their limited sunlight absorption. The hydrogenation of TiO 2 has recently been proposed as a promising new method for enhancing its solar-driven photocatalytic activity. But, the ability of this hydrogenated TiO 2 to transfer electrons across the interface has not been studied in detail. For this reason, the electrochemical properties of hydrogenated <b>self-doped</b> TiO 2 −x nanocrystals are studied and compared to commercial anatase TiO 2 nanocrystals. Here we use cyclic voltammetry (CV) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) as tools to characterize the semiconductors and, in particular, to evaluate their reactivity towards redox species in solution. CV is {{used to evaluate the}} doping level; we propose the co-presence of permanent defects, induced by the hydrogenation reductive treatment, as well as temporary ones, induced electrochemically. By using ferrocenemethanol as the redox-active species, SECM, in a substrate/tip configuration, demonstrates that the electron transfer is facilitated on hydrogenated <b>self-doped</b> TiO 2 −x by a potential-shift of approximately 0. 3 – 0. 4  V...|$|R
