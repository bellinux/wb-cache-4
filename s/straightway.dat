5|$|Somewhat {{apocryphal}} stories tell of Augustus {{pleading with}} Tiberius to stay, even {{going so far}} as to stage a serious illness. Tiberius's response was to anchor off the shore of Ostia until word came that Augustus had survived, then sailing <b>straightway</b> for Rhodes. Tiberius reportedly regretted his departure and requested to return to Rome several times, but each time Augustus refused his requests.|$|E
5|$|Kurt Busch and Montoya {{moved into}} fourth and ninth {{positions}} respectively on lap 141. By the 150th lap, Johnson {{had built up}} a 2.7 second lead over Hamlin. On lap 162, Johnson's lead of 3.4 seconds was reduced to nothing when debris was spotted on the track, causing a caution. During the caution, some of the leaders elected to make pit stops. Johnson remained the leader on the restart, ahead of Bowyer and Hamlin. Two laps later, a multi-car collision occurred on the front <b>straightway</b> as Earnhardt lost control of his car, and collected Logano, Scott Speed, Hornish, Bobby Labonte, Kenseth, Stewart, Vickers and Keselowski. The damaged cars headed to the pit road during the caution as crews cleaned up debris.|$|E
5|$|The half {{marathon}} {{course was}} designed in a double-looped, or , format which had Wuxiang Square {{as the central}} start and finish point for the race, situated just off Nanning's Minzu Avenue. The route left the square in a westerly direction along Minzu Avenue, before turning north on Binhu Road. It turned left onto Changu Road and followed Dongge Road up to the Guangxi People's Hall, which was around the 8km mark. Turning back eastwards via Minsheng Road and Gonghe Road, the route ran along the <b>straightway</b> of Minzu Avenue, passing the halfway marker at this point.|$|E
5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us <b>straightway</b> attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} {{resolved}} to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

He is a capital humorist {{but when he}} poses as a {{publicist}} he gets into trouble <b>straightway.</b> His article in the North American Review is not good humor, and is very bad politics.

25|$|During a {{game against}} the Red Sox on August 18, 2013, Rodriguez was {{involved}} with key moments against Ryan Dempster. The first time he faced Dempster, Rodriguez was hit by a pitch on a 3-0 count, leading to home plate umpire Brian O'Nora warning both benches and ejecting Girardi while Dempster was allowed to stay in the game. Later {{in the top of the}} 6th inning, Rodriguez hit a 442-foot home run to <b>straightway</b> center off Dempster. The Yankees won 9-6 and Dempster, who hit Rodriguez before, was suspended 5 games by the MLB with an undisclosed fine.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} the Franks, hearing that both the Goths and Romans had {{suffered}} severely by the war... forgetting for the moment their oaths and treaties... (for this nation in matters of trust is the most treacherous in the world), they <b>straightway</b> gathered {{to the number of}} one hundred thousand under the leadership of Theudebert I and marched into Italy: they had a small body of cavalry about their leader, and these were the only ones armed with spears, while all the rest were foot soldiers having neither bows nor spears, but each man carried a sword and shield and one axe. Now the iron head of this weapon was thick and exceedingly sharp on both sides, while the wooden handle was very short. And they are accustomed always to throw these axes at a signal in the first charge and thus to shatter the shields of the enemy and kill the men.|$|E
25|$|The {{stipulation}} {{in favor}} of Armenian autonomy in the treaty of Berlin produced an immediate change. Unfortunately there were special difficulties for {{the realization of the}} so-called Ottoman liberal political program that could end with what article stipulated. For one thing not all the Armenians were under the Ottoman Empire. As the population considered, there was Armenians in the Russian Empire approaching to 900,000 at the nineteenth century. Ottoman subjects amounting perhaps to 1,200,000, were distributed through the six vilayets of Sivas, Bitlis, Erzerum, Harput, Diabekir, and Van. In some of these districts, they had the highest ethnic minority, among the Turks, Greeks, Assyrians, Jews, and Kurds but Armenians failed to represent more than %50 percent, a clear majority, in any district with which they were associated. Besides other difficulties, Armenians perceived the conditions of treaty (Article LXI) of Berlin as an early realization of their autonomy, if the powers should have proceeded <b>straightway</b> to enforce the Armenian provision. The rationalization of humanitarian intervention depended also to the Cyprus Convention besides the Treaty of Berlin, 1878. In 1879, one year of after the agreements, the only thing missing was the practical events to enable the articles for the demand of an Armenian state.|$|E

Clague later said: [...] "Mrs Lennon just ran {{straight}} {{out in front of}} me. I just couldn't avoid her. I was not speeding, I swear it. It {{was just one of those}} terrible things that happen." [...] Baird and Jackie (aged eleven and eight respectively) were sent <b>straightway</b> to stay in Edinburgh at their Aunt Mater's, and were not allowed to attend the funeral. [...] They were told two months later by Norman Birch (Lennon's uncle) that their mother had died. Lennon's Aunt Harriet and Uncle Norman Birch were made legal guardians of the girls—ignoring Dykins' parentage, as he had never legally married Julia. Julia was buried in the Allerton Cemetery, in Liverpool.

500|$|Attempting to {{reconcile}} these disparate positions, Eastern Orthodox theologian Dr. Mario Baghos notes that [...] "when taken {{at face value}} the saint seems to be contradicting himself in these passages; {{on the one hand}} he asserted the salvation of all and the complete eradication of evil, and, on the other, that the fire needed to purge evil is ‘sleepless’, i.e. everlasting. The only solution to this inconsistency is to view any allusion to universal salvation in St Gregory as an expression of God’s intention for humanity, which is in fact attested to when his holy sister states that God has “one goal [...] some <b>straightway</b> even in this life purified from evil, others healed hereafter through fire for the appropriate length of time.” That we can choose either to accept or ignore this purification is confirmed by the saint’s many exhortations that we freely undertake the virtuous path." [...] Dr. Ilaria Ramelli has made the observation that for Gregory free will was compatible with universal salvation, since every person would eventually accept the good having gone through purification. However, Gregory conceded that some sinners, such as Judas, might never be completely purified when he wrote, [...] "that which never existed is to be preferred to that which has existed in such sin. For, as to the latter, on account of the depth of the ingrained evil, the chastisement in the way of purgation will be extended into infinity".|$|E

2500|$|And {{they come}} into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and says to him, [...] "Son of David, have mercy on me." [...] But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered, went off with her into the garden where the tomb was, and <b>straightway</b> a great cry was heard from the tomb. And going near Jesus rolled away the stone from {{the door of the}} tomb. And <b>straightway,</b> going in where the youth was, he {{stretched}} forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told him what to do and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the kingdom of God. And thence, arising, he returned {{to the other side of}} the Jordan.|$|E
2500|$|Justinian rebuilt his birthplace in Illyricum, as Justiniana Prima, more in {{a gesture}} of imperium than out of an urbanistic necessity; another [...] "city", was reputed to have been founded, {{according}} to Procopius' panegyric on Justinian's buildings, precisely at the spot where the general Belisarius touched shore in North Africa: the miraculous spring that gushed forth to give them water and the rural population that <b>straightway</b> abandoned their ploughshares for civilised life within the new walls, lend a certain taste of unreality to the project.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving Christian depiction is a fresco of the 4th {{century in}} the Catacomb of Via Latina, Rome. [...] Four figures are on the bank, with Moses still in the water; the largest is the princess, who stretches out her arms, which the baby also does. [...] This gesture may derive from a textual variation found in Midrashic sources and the Aramaic translation of the Bible. In these [...] "she ... sent her female slave" [...] is changed to [...] "she stretched out her arm". [...] Though the context is Christian, many of the images here are of Old Testament subjects, and very likely reflect models adopted from an initially Jewish visual tradition, perhaps painted by artisans with sets of models for all religious requirements. [...] In the play Exagōgē by Ezekiel the Tragedian (3rd century BC), Moses recounts his finding, saying of the princess [...] "And <b>straightway</b> seeing me, she took me up", which may be reflected both in the New Testament Acts 7:20, and in artistic depictions where the princess is apparently first to grasp the ark.|$|E
2500|$|Procopius narrates: [...] "The plague which I {{mentioned}} in the previous narrative was ravaging the population of Byzantium. And the Emperor Justinian was taken very seriously ill, {{so that it was}} even reported that he had died. And this report was circulated by rumour and was carried as far as the Roman army. There some of the commanders began to say that, if the Romans should set up a second Justinian as Emperor over them in Byzantium, they would never tolerate it. But a little later it so fell out that the Emperor recovered, and the commanders of the Roman army began to slander one another. For Peter the General and John whom they called the Glutton declared that they had heard Belisarius and Bouzes say those things which I have just mentioned. The Empress Theodora, declaring that these slighting things which the men had said were directed against her, became quite out of patience. So she <b>straightway</b> summoned them all to Byzantium and made an investigation of the report." ...|$|E

Now there was a suite of rooms in the Palace, below the ground level, secure and a veritable labyrinth, so {{that it seemed to}} resemble Tartarus, where she usually kept in confinement those who had given offence. So Bouzes was hurled into this pit, and in that place he, a man sprung from a line of consuls, remained, forever unaware of time. For as he sat there in the darkness, he could [...] distinguish whether it was day or night, nor could he communicate with any other person. For the man who threw him his food for each day met him in silence, one as dumb as the other, as one beast meets another. And <b>straightway</b> it was supposed by all that he had died, but no one dared mention or recall him. But two years and four months later she was moved to pity and released the man, and he was seen by all as one who had returned from the dead. But thereafter he always suffered from weak sight and his whole body was sickly." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, however, the English {{see her as}} a demon. Prior to her combat with Talbot, he exclaims, [...] "Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee./Blood will I draw on thee – thou art a witch –/And <b>straightway</b> give thy soul to him thou serv'st" [...] (1.6.5–7). Then, after the fight, he says, [...] "My {{thoughts}} are whirl'd like a potter's wheel./I know not where I am nor what I do./A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,/Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists" [...] (1.6.19–22). Upon arriving in France, Bedford condemns Charles for aligning himself with Joan: [...] "How much he wrongs his fame,/Despairing of his own arms' fortitude,/To join with witches and the help of hell" [...] (2.1.16–18). Talbot responds to this with, [...] "Well, let them practice and converse with spirits./God is our fortress" [...] (2.1.25–26). Later, Talbot refers to her as [...] "Pucelle, that witch, that damn'd sorceress" [...] (3.2.37) and [...] "Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite" [...] (3.2.51), declaring [...] "I speak not to that railing Hecate" [...] (3.2.64). Prior to executing her, York also calls her a [...] "Fell banning hag" [...] (5.2.42).|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} play that Thérèse had written on Joan of Arc, the costume she wore almost caught fire. The alcohol stoves used to {{represent}} the stake at Rouen set fire to the screen behind which Thérèse stood. Thérèse did not flinch but the incident marked her. The theme of fire would assume an increasingly great place in her writings. On 9 June 1895, during a mass celebrating the feast of the Holy Trinity, Thérèse had a sudden inspiration that she must offer herself as a sacrificial victim to merciful love. At this time some nuns offered themselves as a victim to God's justice. In her cell she drew up an 'Act of Oblation' for herself and for Céline, and on 11 June, the two knelt before the miraculous Virgin and Thérèse read the document she had written and signed. In the evening of this life, I shall appear before You with empty hands, for I do not ask you lord to count my works.. According to biographer Ida Görres the document echoed the happiness she had felt when Father Alexis Prou, the Franciscan preacher, had assured her that her faults did not cause God sorrow. In the Oblation she wrote, [...] "If through weakness I should chance to fall, may a glance from Your Eyes <b>straightway</b> cleanse my soul, and consume all my imperfections – as fire transforms all things into itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Thus then Chosroes {{secured the}} power. But at Martyropolis, Sittas and Hermogenes were in fear {{concerning}} the city, {{since they were}} utterly unable to defend it in its peril, and they sent certain men to the enemy, who came before the generals and spoke as follows: [...] "It has escaped your own notice that you are becoming wrongfully an obstacle to {{the king of the}} Persians and to the blessings of peace and to each state. For ambassadors sent from the emperor are even now present in order that they may go to the king of the Persians and there settle the differences and establish a treaty with him; but do you as quickly as possible remove from the land of the Romans and permit the ambassadors to act in the manner which will be of advantage to both peoples. For we are ready also to give as hostages men of repute concerning these very things, to prove that they will be actually accomplished at no distant date." [...] Such were the words of the ambassadors of the Romans. It happened also that a messenger came to them from the palace, who brought them word that Cabades had died and that Chosroes, son of Cabades, had become king over the Persians, and that in this way the situation had become unsettled. And {{as a result of this}} the generals heard the words of the Romans gladly, since they feared also the attack of the Huns. The Romans therefore <b>straightway</b> gave as hostages Martinus and one of the body-guards of Sittas, Senecius by name; so the Persians broke up the siege and made their departure promptly.|$|E
