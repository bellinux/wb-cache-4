40|$|The {{design of}} a culvert inlet has a {{significant}} bearing upon {{the relationship of the}} head to the discharge of a culvert. Its relative importance hinges upon the type of flow occurring in the culvert, which in turn is governed by the location of the control section. For part-full flow the control may be either at the inlet or the outlet depending on whether the slope is hydraulically steep or mild. In the case of <b>short</b> <b>culverts,</b> control may be at the inlet even for horizontal or mild slopes. For full flow, barrel friction provides the control. The head-discharge curves of culverts having square-edge inlets have been compared with those for culverts having rounded inlets to illustrate the conditions for which a head-advantage may be obtained by using a rounded inlet. These comparisons have been made for three categories of culvert flow: long culverts on steep slopes, long culverts on mild slopes, and <b>short</b> <b>culverts.</b> Dimensionless head-discharge curves have been plotted for culvert flow in each category. For culverts on steep slopes, experimental data have been compared with the computed values and, since the agreement was reasonably good, serve as a basis for the analysis of flow in culverts operating under conditions other than those for which the tests were made. The greatest head-advantage for a particular discharge of the rounded inlet over that of a square-edge inlet was found for those cases in which the control section was located at the inlet. These were long culverts on steep slopes or <b>short</b> <b>culverts</b> where the length was negligible. for long culverts on mild slopes, the head-advantage was far less pronounced...|$|E
40|$|Wildlife-vehicle {{collisions}} (WVCs) negatively impact wildlife {{populations and}} create dangerous driving situations for motorists. In Utah, USA, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) encounter {{a variety of}} hazards {{as they attempt to}} cross highways and interstates, some of which are 8 lanes wide. Agencies have sought to mitigate the risks posed to drivers and mule deer by building crossing structures for wildlife. The objectives of this study were {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} crossing structures in Utah to safely pass mule deer under highways and to determine the variables that best explain mule deer passage use. From 2008 - 2011 we used 26 camera traps to measure levels of mule deer use of 9 culverts and 4 bridges in Utah. We tested for relationships between mule deer structure use and a variety of structural and landscape attributes at each site, including 2 time variables: time since the structure was built and time each structure was monitored by our camera traps. We also developed and tested a new equation (window ratio) that measured culvert openness to approaching mule deer. In the single variable regression models, mule deer structure use was positively correlated with <b>short</b> <b>culverts</b> and coarse scale shrub cover, and negatively correlated with fine scale grass cover. In the multivariate model, structure use was positively correlated with days monitored and elevation and <b>short</b> <b>culverts.</b> Although the new window ratio did not emerge as the most important predictor for mule deer crossing use, it was more effective at predicting mule deer culvert use than the often referenced openness factor. Our results indicated that 12 of the 13 crossing structures studied effectively facilitate the movement of mule deer in Utah; however some were used far more than others. We suggest that older crossing structures built with the shortest dimensions possible, with attached wildlife-exclusion fencing, and in shrubby habitat will be most effective at passing a high volume of mule deer under Utah highways...|$|E
40|$|The {{waterway}} axis Rhine/Meuse-Main-Danube crosses Europe transversally {{from the}} North Sea at Rotterdam to the Black Sea in Romania. This corridor {{is one of}} the longest ones in the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) and crosses both EU countries and non-Member States. In order to increase the transport capacity along this axis, many projects are supported by the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency as part of the priority project 18. The increase of the lock capacity of the Meuse River in Belgium to reach class ECMT VIb, allowing the traffic of boats carrying up to 9, 000 tonnes, {{is one of the}}se projects. The new lock at Ampsin-Neuville will have a 225 m x 25 m chamber, with a 4. 70 m head. This lock will be built between an existing 136 m x 16 m lock and the weir. As the existing lock is equipped with lateral translation gates, these gates recesses constrain significantly the location of the new lock. Therefore, a through-the-head filling system has been preferred to the longitudinal culvert system selected for similar locks on the River Meuse. This paper focuses on the design of the upstream head of this new lock, equipped with <b>short</b> <b>culverts</b> and a dissipation chamber. In order to guide the design of this filling system, a scale model of the lock head has been set-up at the Hydraulics Research Laboratory of Walloon waterways administration. The specific aim of this model was to investigate different configurations of the conduit network and of the dissipation chamber in order to limit the hawser forces encountered by vessels in the lock chamber, through a reduction of waves and free-surface slopes in the lock itself, and a sufficient uniformity in flow distribution at the dissipation chamber outlet. A composite modelling approach has been used in conjunction with this physical model to optimise the design. The key parameter {{in the design of the}} dissipation chamber was the placement of energy and momentum dissipation devices. In order to guide this design, and to limit the number of tests in the scale model, 2 D numerical simulations of the flow inside the chamber were run in a variety of configurations such as e. g. longitudinal walls, square columns in aligned or staggered layout, round columns in aligned and staggered layouts. The best options were tested in the scale model. Head-losses and velocity distribution at the exit of the dissipation chamber were measured, for different combinations of upstream water level and discharge through the culverts, representative of different stages of the filling process. The measurements were finally compared with the predictions by the numerical models...|$|E

50|$|Flowing from Viksjö in Järfälla, {{the stream}} starts as a ditch {{receiving}} considerable amounts of stormwater from the residential area Jakobsberg. After {{a bit more}} than 2 km, near Barkarby Airport, it dives into a <b>short</b> <b>culvert</b> before merging with another ditch (Veddsta dike) bringing water from a golf range, industrial and residential areas. It then passes under the traffic route E18 to continue 1 km through am open grassland in it natural meandering shape past some allotment-gardens near Tensta before reaching the ponds in the park of Hjulsta. The stream is guided under the central commercial district of Spånga through a tunnel 1.4 km long, opening out near Bromsten industrial area, and receiving stormwater from surrounding areas. It then flows past the residential neighbourhood Bällsta before reaching two ponds in a park and receiving water from a second ditch (Nälsta dike) bringing water from residential areas at Nälsta, Flysta, and Solhem. It then flows through the harness racing track Solvalla where the water is used for fountains during races. Downstream Solvalla, it becomes broad with a slow flow occasionally becoming stagnant. Bällstaån finally receives water from Rissne, Duvbo, and Sundbyberg before emptying into Bällstaviken under the bridge Löfströmsbron.|$|R
50|$|The culverted section once {{contained}} a dock {{and the two}} Pontardawe Locks. The Pontardawe Tin Plate Works was located immediately {{to the east of}} the canal between the locks, and by 1878 was served by railway sidings which crossed the river to reach the works. Approaching Trebanos, the canal re-emerges from its culvert, to reach Trebanos Lock and Green Lock. The Pheasant Bush Tin Works beside Trebanos Lock was disused by 1898. By Coedgwilym Park, the canal turns briefly to the west, to pass under the B4603 Pontardawe Road bridge, and then there is another <b>short</b> <b>culverted</b> section beneath a council depot, which was the location of a lock. You can walk around the council depot and the drop in level between each end is quite noticeable. There are suggestions that lock 6 is still intact underneath the depot {{at the point where the}} canal drops into the culvert through large metal grids. There was a short tramway from below the lock to Ynys-penllwch Graig-ola Colliery. Mond Lock was next, with the B4603 crossing the tail of the lock. Below the bridge is the Mond Nickel Works, set up in 1900 after the chemist Dr Ludwig Mond discovered a process for producing pure nickel. Nickel ore was imported from Canada, and the site was chosen because there were supplies of anthracite coal, water, transport links to Swansea, and an available labour force. The canal crosses the Lower Clydach River on an aqueduct, which discharges water into the river, and the watered section comes to an abrupt halt about 50 yd further on.|$|R
2500|$|The river rises on {{the north}} side of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, just to the south of Sutton Parkway railway station. It is a little above the [...] contour at this point. It crosses under the railway line, and there are two <b>short</b> <b>culverted</b> {{sections}} as it crosses under the B6022 road, to emerge in the Maun Valley Industrial Park. Passing under the B6139 and the A617 roads, it feeds King's Mill Reservoir. The reservoir was once a medieval mill pond, but in 1837, William Bentinck, the fourth Duke of Portland agreed with the millers who leased mills further down the river that a large head of water was required to maintain the water supply throughout the year. He built a dam, and [...] of farmland were flooded, some of which he bought from the Unwin family. The work was completed by 1839, when rates to be paid by the millers were agreed, which were to be reduced after 20 years. A [...] walk has been created around the lake, from where some of the waterfowl which live on it can be seen. It is also used for sailing. At the exit from the reservoir, the river is crossed by Kings Mill viaduct, built around 1819 for the Mansfield and Pinxton Railway. The engineer for the project was Josias Jessop, and the bridge was the location for the opening ceremony of the railway. A local newspaper described it as [...] "the beautiful five-arched bridge, constructed under the direction of Mr. Jessop, the engineer", when reporting the opening. The central arch carries the date 1817. It was adapted for locomotive traffic in 1847, was restored in 1990, and is a grade II listed structure. It is now used as a footpath, as the railway line was historically diverted around it.|$|R
500|$|The {{establishment}} of the RCMB despite previous plans for the road became a barrier to the Poinciana Parkway's construction. There was concern of setting a precedent of allowing development in conservation areas {{that are supposed to}} be protected from development. In order to preserve the wetland habitat, officials wanted a bridge over the wetland habitat, while Avatar contended that bridging the wetland would be too expensive and proposed <b>short</b> bridges or <b>culverts</b> for water and animals to pass. In 2008, the Army Corps of Engineers determined that the road could only be built if it included two [...] bridges, adding $20–40million to the project's cost or remove the land north of the wetlands from the bank, compensating the bank's owners. The Corps also considered other alignments that would avoid the bank, but concluded that they were worse logistically, environmentally, or traffic-wise.|$|R
40|$|The main {{question}} of this thesis {{is the result}} of a survey by ‘provincie Zuid-Holland’ (PZH), that has developed a ‘uniform model’ for the assessment of the structural safety of existing prefabricated culverts. PZH is considering the possibility of using generic parameters to decide on the strength of existing culverts in the area. The province wants to show that all culverts, given their size and other material characteristics, are strong enough to carry the traffic loads prevailing in Netherlands. The PZH has decided to provide some elements of a replacement culvert (Schaapswegduiker) for the (destructive) determination of the strength. This has been realized based on the results of this thesis. The aim of the thesis is to determine the maximum load that can be carried and to assess the structural safety of the Schaapswegduiker, in accordance with current regulations. In order to answer this research question, a literature study was conducted to assess the structural safety of existing structures. Schaapswegduiker is assessed for traffic loads LM 1 and LM 2 in accordance with RBK 1. 1, NEN 8700, NEN 8701 and NEN-EN- 1991 - 2. First, a materials research has been performed (by Nebest) based on my plan of action, to determine the proper output parameters for the calculations. Hereafter two calculation models have been prepared to validate the uniform model of PZH: a framework model (comparable to uniform model) and an advanced nonlinear FEM model. The advanced non-linear calculation has been carried out by means of a 2 D-model DIANA. Using this model, I have made a prediction, a plan of action and a set-up for the test load that is carried out (by Heijmans). The DIANA-model is calibrated with the results of the test. Lastly, the influence of the by ground enclosed culvert on the load-bearing capacity has been analyzed For all calculation models, the spread of the traffic load on the deck of the culvert is considered as uniformly distributed load. The load-bearing capacity and the assessing of the structural safety for the framework model (calculation model 1) is as follows. Applying the material properties assumed by PZH (design values), the culvert does not meet (UC = 1. 09 for shear force). Applying the design values of the measured material properties by the material research (with a non-exact reinforcement configuration) are used, the culvert still does not meet (UC = 1. 02 for shear force). Applying the (material properties of the calibrated model) upper limit of the design values of the measured values including spread and the exact reinforcement configuration, the culvert meets the assessment (UC = 0. 92 for shear force). The associated load-bearing capacity is 443 kN. With framework models, sufficient strength can be demonstrated using the measured values and exact reinforcement configuration. However, with an advanced model, a higher strength (in this case an increase of a factor 1. 9) can be determined. With the calibrated DIANA-model, a load-bearing capacity of 840 kN has been determined with a corresponding UC of 0. 53. The upper limit of the design values of the measured values including spread and the exact reinforcement configuration have been used for this calculation as well. This determined strength is including the maximum negative influence of the load-bearing capacity for culvert which is enclosed by ground. This reduced the load-bearing capacity by 10 %. In <b>short,</b> the <b>culvert</b> meets the test for assessing the structural safety for both models. An advanced model with a nonlinear calculation in EEM calculates a factor of 1. 9 higher load-bearing capacity and UC, compared with a framework model which is linear-elastic. This factor includes the maximum negative influence of the culvert in the ground and a conservative calibration of the model (DIANA-model is calibrated up to a maximum of 81 %). That means that this determined factor can actually be even higher. PZH is recommended to go through the following phases when assessing other culverts. Phase 1, design values should be used when there is enough information available about the culvert. When the UC does not meet, there should be continuation to phase 2. Here a materials research will be done. Precise determination of the material properties is important, especially the reinforcement configuration. It has been shown that it is worth paying extra attention to the reinforcement configuration. When the UC does not meet with the design values of the under limit of the design values of the measured values, there should be continuation to phase 3. Here, an advanced non-linear calculation is with FEM recommended, such as DIANA. The same material properties are assumed as in phase 2.
