5|$|To {{experience}} {{firsthand the}} processes mod-makers {{would have to}} go through with the new engine, Valve ported Half-Life (dubbed Half-Life: Source) and Counter-Strike to their new Source engine. Half-Life: Source is a <b>straight</b> <b>port,</b> lacking any new content or the Blue Shift High Definition pack. However, it does take advantage of vertex and pixel shaders for more realistic water effects, as well as Half-Life 2's realistic physics engine. They also added several other features from Half-Life 2, including improved dynamic lightmaps, vertex maps, ragdolls, and a shadowmap system with cleaner, higher resolution, specular texture and normal maps, as well as utilization of the render-to-texture soft shadows found in Half-Life 2s Source engine, along with 3D skybox replacements in place of the old 16-bit color prerendered bitmap skies. The Half-Life port possesses many of the Source engine's graphical strengths as well as control weaknesses that have been noted in the Source engine. Later updates added a field of view options, support for OS X and Linux, an optional high-definition texture pack, among other improvements. Half-Life: Source is available with special editions of Half-Life 2, or separately on Steam.|$|E
500|$|Vampyr was {{originally}} released on DVD on 13 May 1998 by Image Entertainment which ran at an abridged 72-minute running time. Image's release of Vampyr is a <b>straight</b> <b>port</b> of the Laserdisc that film restorer David Shepard produced in 1991. The subtitles {{are large and}} ingrained due to the source print having Danish subtitles which have been blacked out and covered. This DVD also included the short film The Mascot as a bonus feature. The Criterion Collection released a two-disc edition of Vampyr on 22 July 2008. This edition of the DVD includes the original German version of the film, along with a book featuring Dreyer and Christen Jul's original screenplay and Sheridan Le Fanu's 1872 story [...] "Carmilla". A Region 2 DVD of the film was released by Eureka Films on 25 August 2008. The Eureka release contains the same bonus material as the Criterion Collection discs, but also includes a commentary from director Guillermo del Toro.|$|E
500|$|The PC port {{was also}} well-received. Lee Buchanan of PC Gamer US praised [...] "the {{spectacular}} visuals that bring to life the most jarring collisions I've {{seen on a}} computer", and he noted that [...] " [...] damage is depicted beautifully". Like Lucas, he wrote that the player [...] "can't just mindlessly smash into other cars; this is thinking man's destruction". Although he found the game too easy [...] "even at the toughest difficulty level", he found {{this to be a}} minor issue that did not detract from the experience. He considered the game's online play to be a high point, and he finished, [...] "Destruction Derby is a blast, and a welcome change of pace from high-end driving simulations." [...] Peter Olafson of Computer Gaming World called the game [...] "a great simulation" [...] of demolition derbies, and he wrote that the wrecks are [...] "convulsive and realistic". He believed that the game [...] "has never-before-seen quality that will instantly make it a showpiece game to demonstrate to open-mouthed friends and relatives", and he considered the car damage to be [...] "especially marvelous—and unprecedented for this sort of game". However, he found that its [...] "useful life span is surprisingly short" [...] and he hoped for a track editor in its sequel. He summarised, [...] "Despite its limitations, this is a great game, but it has a lot more potential." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation remarked that while the game is a <b>straight</b> <b>port</b> of the PlayStation version, it is an impeccably accurate one. He applauded the authentic modelling of vehicle crashes, multiple modes, smoothness of gameplay, and inclusion of both network and modem options, and found the game's only downside is that the camera zooms out so little that {{it can be difficult to}} see nearby cars.|$|E
50|$|A {{prominent}} distinction {{from the}} earlier Classes 14, 14A and 14B locomo&shy;tives was their American style high running boards. It had an even better cylinder design than the Class 14, with larger and <b>straighter</b> <b>ports</b> {{which resulted in a}} very sharp, free exhaust.|$|R
5000|$|Due {{in part to}} {{the free}} and open source nature of Linux and Maemo, porting {{applications}} to Maemo is a straightforward procedure. Because of this, there are many third-party applications available for the platform. Some applications are original software written specifically for Maemo, while other applications are <b>straight</b> <b>ports</b> of existing Linux programs. Some notable software includes: ...|$|R
50|$|Also, the splayed valve angle {{causes the}} valve seat plane to be tilted, giving a straighter flow path for the {{intake and exhaust}} to/from the port exiting the {{cylinder}} head. Engineers have learned that while increasing the valve size with <b>straighter</b> <b>port</b> is beneficial for increasing the maximum power at high rpm, it slows the intake flow speed, not providing the best combustion event for emissions, efficiency, or power in the normal rpm range.|$|R
2500|$|A {{preview of}} the PlayStation version in Next Generation called it [...] "one of the best PC {{strategy}} games ever". According to a 1996 review by GameSpot, [...] "put simply, X-COM is a bona fide modern classic, standing proudly alongside Civilization and Populous as a benchmark {{in the evolution of}} strategy gaming." [...] A 1996 review of the PlayStation version by Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that [...] "any person who likes strategy games will fall in love with this title" [...] and added that [...] "if you could afford to buy one game for the PS over the next year, X-COM would be it. It has it all and then some!" [...] A reviewer for Next Generation criticized the PlayStation version for being little more than a <b>straight</b> <b>port,</b> arguing that the game could have been improved if the console's capabilities were used. However, he praised the game itself for its sophisticated, enjoyable gameplay, and concluded, [...] "X-Com was a smashing PC title, it's lost nothing of practical value in the translation, and makes a marvelous addition to the console market." [...] A rare dissenting review by GamePro stated that [...] "You have to be a major sim-freak to enjoy X-Com. It's an interesting and complex game about planet colonizing, but the extensive manuals and one-dimensional music really bore you to alien tears after a while." [...] Computer Gaming World gave it its Game of the Year award for 1994. PC Gamer US presented Enemy Unknown with its 1994 [...] "Best Strategy Game" [...] award. The editors wrote, [...] "X-COMs classic mix of action and strategy will have you hooked for hours, and made this one of the finest games of the year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is Moore," [...] said Shirley, {{pointing}} {{right across}} the wide field where a thousand children were playing, and now nearly a thousand adult spectators walking about. [...] "There--can you miss the tall stature and <b>straight</b> <b>port?</b> He looks amidst the set that surround him like Eliab amongst humbler shepherds--like Saul in a war-council; and a war-council it is, if I am not mistaken." ...|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "new 3.4" [...] {{used the}} <b>straight</b> <b>port</b> head, had ribbed cam covers and the heads were unpainted.|$|E
50|$|After ERE's {{absorption}} by Infogrames {{in summer}} of 1987 (partly justified by preliminary versions of Captain Blood), Ulrich and Bouchon isolated {{themselves in the}} Landes {{in order to have}} the game ready for Christmas. Many adaptations for both 16-bit and 8-bit machines were developed in successive months, although they were <b>straight</b> <b>ports</b> of the original Atari ST version in graphics, sound effects or music, and therefore follow the limitations of that machine.|$|R
50|$|The Class 14 had Walschaerts {{valve gear}} and a Belpaire firebox and was superheated. It was {{delivered}} with Type MP1 tenders, {{which had a}} coal capacity of 10 lt t and a water capacity of 4250 imp gal. Apart from the differences in their coupled wheel diameters, the Class 14 was a better locomotive with a more modern cylinder design, having <b>straighter</b> <b>ports</b> and a larger steam chest volume {{than the other two}} classes.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Amstrad {{began to focus}} on {{portable}} computers rather than desktop computers. In 1990, Amstrad tried to enter the video game console market with the Amstrad GX4000, similar to what Commodore did at the same time with the C64 GS. The console, based on the Amstrad 464 Plus hardware, was a complete commercial failure, because it used outdated technology, and most games available for it were <b>straight</b> <b>ports</b> of CPC games that could be purchased for much less in their original format.|$|R
5000|$|All of the 2.8-litre XK engines {{used the}} <b>straight</b> <b>port</b> head unpainted, which some sources may {{describe}} as [...] "silver", and had ribbed cam covers.|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} also {{released}} for the PlayStation in Europe only, again {{under the title}} Titan Wars. The PlayStation version is a <b>straight</b> <b>port</b> of the Saturn version.|$|E
50|$|Rune: Viking Warlord is the PlayStation 2 port of Rune, {{released}} in 2001 by Take-Two Interactive. It contains {{a few extra}} maps and enemies, but is otherwise a <b>straight</b> <b>port.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{in-cylinder}} gasoline {{direct injection}} (GDI) engine, incorporating novel combustion technologies, has been developed. Such innovative technologies consist of the upright <b>straight</b> <b>ports</b> to generate tumble motion, the electromagnetic swirl injector to realize optimized spray dispersion and atomization and the compact piston cavity to maintain charge stratification, and in addition other highly advanced technologies to achieve desirable engine management. This new GDI engine is thus available with ultra lean stratified combustion for higher thermal efficiency under partial loads as well as homogenous combustion to realize higher performance under full load...|$|R
50|$|Support from games {{companies}} was limited, as {{many were}} unconvinced that the C64GS {{would be a}} success in the console market. Ocean Software was the most supportive, offering {{a wide range of}} titles, some C64GS cartridge-based only, offering features in games that would have been impossible on cassette-based games, others <b>straight</b> <b>ports</b> of games for the original C64. Domark and System 3 also released a number of titles for the system, and conversions of some Codemasters and MicroProse games also appeared. Denton Designs also released some games, among them Bounces, which was released in 1985.|$|R

50|$|Namco also ported Ms. Pac-Man to the NES in 1993. Unlike the Tengen version, {{it was a}} <b>straight</b> <b>port</b> of {{the arcade}} game without any added features, except for 4 extra mazes.|$|E
5000|$|All of the 4.2-litre XK engines {{used the}} <b>straight</b> <b>port</b> head. After {{the arrival of}} the ribbed cam covers in 1967 the heads {{normally}} remained unpainted, which some sources describe as [...] "silver".|$|E
50|$|Elevator Action Old & New (エレベーターアクション OLD&NEW) is {{an update}} to the Elevator Action video game. The game consist {{of the old}} and new game modes. In the old mode, it is a <b>straight</b> <b>port</b> of the NES game.|$|E
50|$|Given the {{successful}} operation of rotary cam poppet valve gear on the Class 19C, {{it was also}} used on the Class 16E. The valves were driven by outside rotary propshafts from turning mechanisms mounted on the driving coupled wheels. The valves were double-seated and housed {{at each end of}} the cylinders, an arrangement that resulted in short and <b>straight</b> <b>ports</b> between the valves and the cylinder barrels. The admission valves were 8 in in diameter and the exhaust valves 9 in. Most of the detail parts of the rotary cam gear, particularly the main drive and reversing gear, were interchangeable with similar parts on the Class 19C. The poppet valve gear gave the engine extremely free-running characteristics.|$|R
5000|$|Adhering to Sir William Lyons' maxim of [...] "grace, {{pace and}} space", the Mark 2 was a fast and capable saloon. It {{came with a}} [...] , [...] or [...] Jaguar XK engine. The 3.8 {{is similar to the}} unit used in the 3.8 E-Type (called XKE in the USA), having the same block, crank, {{connecting}} rods and pistons but different inlet manifold and carburation (two SUs versus three on the E-Type in Europe) and therefore [...] less. The head of the six-cylinder engine in the Mark 2 had curved ports compared to the <b>straight</b> <b>ports</b> of the E-Type configuration. The 3.4 Litre and 3.8 Litre cars were fitted with twin SU HD6 carburettors and the 2.4 Litre with twin Solex carburettors.|$|R
50|$|The Mintos went to Winnipeg in 1911 {{and played}} off against Port Arthur, {{winners of the}} New Ontario Hockey League. They fell in defeat in <b>straight</b> games. <b>Port</b> Arthur {{would go on to}} lose a {{challenge}} series for the Stanley Cup to the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey Association.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the small}} amount of {{character}} animation data in Street Fighter Alpha, Capcom was able to do a relatively <b>straight</b> <b>port</b> to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation; source code from the arcade version is incorporated into both home versions.|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} praised {{for being a}} perfect Dreamcast port of the {{original}} Model 3 Arcade game (unlike Virtua Fighter 3tb which was a loose port), however the developers did not include any additional extras for this release, making it a <b>straight</b> <b>port.</b>|$|E
50|$|The North American {{release of}} the PlayStation version {{was the subject of}} {{considerable}} negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console. The Sega Saturn version of the game was a <b>straight</b> <b>port</b> of the PlayStation version.|$|E
5000|$|Compared with OHV pushrod {{systems with}} {{the same number of}} valves, the {{reciprocating}} components of the OHC system are fewer and have a lower overall mass. Though the system that drives the camshafts may be more complex, most [...] accept that added complexity as a trade-off for better engine performance and greater design flexibility. The fundamental reason for the OHC valvetrain is that it offers an increase in the engine's ability to exchange induction and exhaust gases. (This exchange is sometimes known as 'engine breathing'. [...] ) Another performance advantage is gained {{as a result of the}} better optimised port configurations made possible with overhead camshaft designs. With no intrusive pushrods, the overhead camshaft cylinder head design can use <b>straighter</b> <b>ports</b> of more advantageous cross-section and length. The OHC design allows for higher engine speeds than comparable cam-in-block designs, as a result of having lower valvetrain mass. The higher engine speeds thus allowed increases power output for a given torque output.|$|R

50|$|An {{updated version}} called Missile Command 3D was {{released}} for the Atari Jaguar in 1995. It contains three {{versions of the}} game: Classic (a <b>straight</b> <b>port</b> of the arcade game), 3D (graphically upgraded and with a rotating viewpoint), and Virtual. It is the only game that works with the virtual reality helmet from Virtuality.|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} released on the Atari ST, {{followed by a}} conversion for the Apple Macintosh. A version for the Commodore Amiga was eventually released in 2014, due to reverse engineering the ST version. It is a <b>straight</b> <b>port.</b> The Atari ST, created entirely by Dan Hewitt, version was a cult favorite in the UK, where it received rave reviews.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 {{the game}} was ported by People Can Fly to the Xbox as Painkiller: Hell Wars. While not a <b>straight</b> <b>port,</b> it is {{actually}} a mix {{of the game and}} its expansion, Painkiller: Battle Out Of Hell. Painkiller: Hell Wars was also announced for Sony's PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2. However, both versions were canceled worldwide. Official publisher of Painkiller: Hell Wars is DreamCatcher.|$|E
50|$|The Liberty Gate {{there is}} a {{sculpture}} from 1981-82 of Hein Heinsen, Stig Brøgger and Mogens Møller, {{is probably the most}} controversial artwork in Hvidovre.
