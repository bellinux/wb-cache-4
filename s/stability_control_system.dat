5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric variable gear ratio power steering, and electronically controlled braking. The new <b>stability</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E
5|$|Released in September 2009, the E Series 2 HSV GTS {{incorporated}} {{a more powerful}} motor and drivetrain than other HSV models. It retains the same GM LS3 6.2L V8 engine but {{while the rest of}} the HSV range still have 317kW or 425bhp, the GTS engine is rated at (325kW). Twin bonnet scoops have returned to this model from the styling of the Pontiac G8. Other changes include the availability of launch control on manual versions, a recalibrated version of the magnetic ride control suspension with stiffer springs for the HSV GTS, wider wheels and a new high-flow dual-mode muffler system that produces a throatier roar under heavy acceleration. The E-Series 2 <b>stability</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> also has a Competition setting which allows for more wheel slip for special track or motorsport applications. The cruise control brakes the car when it is travelling downhill to ensure its speed stays within one per cent of the set speed. This model has daytime running lights.|$|E

25|$|Ford also {{improved}} {{upon the}} handling {{characteristics of the}} GT500. The overall stance of the car has been lowered by 11 millimeters in front and 8 millimeters at the rear. The car also features Ford's new Electric Power Assist Steering (EPAS) that improves torque build-up and road feel which delivers quicker and more precise steering, increased effort on the racetrack or winding roads, and reduced effort in low-speed parking maneuvers. The car also has Ford's AdvanceTrac <b>stability</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> which features a sport mode when pressed twice consecutively while stopped with the brakes applied.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{engine was}} a 4.0L V6 mated to a 5-speed manual transmission or an optional 5-speed automatic transmission. The V6 powertrains were unchanged from {{those used in}} 2005–2009 Mustangs. Though the 2010 Mustang V-6 retained a single exhaust outlet, {{the diameter of the}} tip had been increased one-half of an inch to three inches. The 2010 Mustang included new spring rates and dampers to improve ride quality and control and Ford's AdvanceTrac traction and <b>stability</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> standard. Newly standard on the base Mustang were 17-inch painted aluminum wheels while 18-inch wheels continue to be optional (except for V8 models, where 18-inch wheels were mounted by default). Other new available features and options for the 2010 Mustang included Ford SYNC, dual-zone automatic climate control, an updated navigation system with Sirius Travel Link, a capless fuel filler, a reverse camera system to aid in backing up, and an updated version of the V6 Pony Package.|$|E
500|$|It was {{discovered}} that the craft was inherently unstable in forward flight, as the aerodynamic center of pressure was well forward {{of the center of}} gravity. The Avrocar thus included a mechanical <b>stability</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> that was independent of the pilot's controls. The turborotor had a fairly large angular momentum and was intended to act as a powerful gyroscope, providing a [...] "normal" [...] direction of flight. Control cables attached {{to the base of the}} rotor would be pulled when the craft moved in relation to the rotor, actuating the control surfaces to counteract the motion.|$|E

Similar concerns have been raised in the media, although Holden maintains that this is a weight-saving feature and allows for full-size spare tyres to be purchased at an additional cost. Likewise, critics found the omission of standard air conditioning for the Omega model unforgivable, given both the overall hot Australian climate, and the cost of the car. This, however, was rectified in the MY09 upgrade of the Omega (see below).|$|E
500|$|The 2011 Chevrolet Volt {{standard}} {{features include}} 4-wheel anti-lock brakes with traction control; StabiliTrak electronic <b>stability</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> with brake assist; tire-pressure monitoring system; and 8 total airbags: dual-stage frontal, side-impact and knee for driver and front passenger, and roof-rail side-impact for {{front and rear}} outboard seating positions, with a passenger sensing system. There is also available an optional emergency assistance system. A safety cage, built with high-strength and ultra high-strength steel, surrounds the passenger compartment to keep the space intact {{in the event of}} a crash.

2500|$|In 1990, Mitsubishi {{released}} the Diamante (Sigma) in Japan. It featured a new electronically controlled active trace & {{traction control system}} (the first integration of these two systems in the world) that Mitsubishi developed (see Mitsubishi AWC). Simply named TCL in 1990, the system has now evolved into Mitsubishi's modern Active Skid and Traction Control (ASTC) system. Developed to help the driver maintain the intended line through a corner; an onboard computer monitored several vehicle operating parameters through various sensors. When too much throttle has been used when taking a curve, engine output and braking are automatically regulated to ensure the proper line through a curve and to provide the proper amount of traction under various road surface conditions. While conventional traction control systems at the time featured only a slip control function, Mitsubishi's newly developed TCL system had a preventive (active) safety function which improved the course tracing performance by automatically adjusting the traction force (called [...] "trace control") thereby restraining the development of excessive lateral acceleration while turning. Although not a ‘proper’ modern <b>stability</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> trace control monitors steering angle, throttle position and individual wheel speeds {{although there is no}} yaw input. The TCL system's standard wheel slip control function enables better traction on slippery surfaces or during cornering. In addition to the TCL system's individual effect, it also works together with Diamante's electronic controlled suspension and four-wheel steering that Mitsubishi had equipped to improve total handling and performance.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanically the 2010 Shelby GT500 remains {{closely related}} to the 2007–2009 GT500, but the 2010 model has been {{upgraded}} with various features similar to or found in the 2008 Shelby GT500KR. A conical cold air intake and other enhancements to the GT500's supercharged 5.4L DOHC V8 have resulted in an increase in output to @6200rpm and @4500rpm, gains of 40hp and 30lb·ft of torque over the 2007–2009 GT500 respectively. The Tremec TR-6060 6-speed manual transmission returns for the 2010 GT500 but has been enhanced with larger clutch discs ( [...] versus the [...] discs used previously) and other measures to increase performance and noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) control. Additionally, the fifth and sixth gear ratios of the transmission have been changed from 0.80 to 0.74 and 0.63 to 0.50 respectively, contributing to an improvement in fuel efficiency that the 2010 GT500 enjoys over its predecessor. Complementing the transmission's gear ratio changes is a new, more aggressive 3.55:1 ratio rear axle which replaces the 3.31:1 axle used previously. According to Inside Linei drivers of the new 2010 Shelby can expect 0 to 60 times in 4.3 seconds from a stand still and 4 seconds flat with roll out. Elsewhere, the GT500's aluminum hood, in addition to be stylistically {{different from that of the}} Mustang and Mustang GT, features an air extractor that helps cool the engine. Various aerodynamic upgrades, such as the design of the front fascia and the aforementioned Gurney Flap spoiler, contribute to increased downward force and a reduced coefficient of drag. Suspension enhancements found in the GT500KR are used in the 2010 GT500 to improve handling and, specifically, provide better roll control. The 2010 GT500 features Ford's AdvanceTrac traction and <b>stability</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> standard with different settings to control the level of performance the driver desires.|$|E
