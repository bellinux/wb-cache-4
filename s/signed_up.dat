5|$|It was to {{have been}} a five-week race, from 1 June to 5 July, with an entry fee of 20 francs. These {{conditions}} attracted very few cyclists: one week before the race was due to start, only 15 competitors had <b>signed</b> <b>up.</b> Desgrange then rescheduled the race from 1 to 19 July, increased the total prize money to 20,000 francs, reduced the entry fee to 10 francs and guaranteed at least five francs a day to the first 50 cyclists in the classification.

5000|$|Street {{fundraising}} {{is likely}} to continue while it remains cost-effective. Figures state that charities gain as much as three quarters of their income from this method. However, some people find street fundraisers intimidating and may feel pressured into <b>signing</b> <b>up</b> to regular giving agreements. <b>Signing</b> <b>up</b> under pressure is against the fundraisers' guidelines and the majority of fundraisers who operate with good ethics will not <b>sign</b> someone <b>up</b> if they openly articulate their will not to <b>sign</b> <b>up.</b> In the UK some local councils have set up [...] "cold caller exclusion zones" [...] to prevent doorstep fundraisers.|$|R

5|$|More than 9.2 {{million people}} <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> for care on the {{national}} exchange (healthcare.gov) for 2017, down some 400,000 from 2016. This decline was due primarily to the election of President Trump, who pulled advertising encouraging people {{to sign up for}} coverage, issued an executive order that attempts to eliminate the mandate, and has created significant uncertainty {{about the future of the}} ACA. Enrollments had been running ahead of 2016 prior to President Obama leaving office, with 9.8 million expected to sign-up, so President Trump's actions potentially cost about 600,000 national enrollments (i.e., 9.8 million expected − 9.2 million actual = 0.6 million impact). Of the 9.2 million, 3.0 million were new customers and 6.2 million were returning. The 9.2 million excludes the 11 states that run their own exchanges, which have <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> around 3 million additional people. These figures also exclude the additional coverage due to the Medicaid expansion, which covers another approximately 10 million persons, as described in the impact section above.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the causes}} of insurer losses is the lower income, older and sicker enrollee population.

The percentage continued to decline as income rose: 2% of those above 400% enrolled.|$|E
