Air India is {{believed}} to have accepted the proposal and planning to launch a small Aircraft (50 Seater) to boost the tourism in the state. The government-owned Vayudoot operated a 20-seater aircraft to this airport in the past but the service was terminated in 1987. The foundation stone of the new terminal was laid in March 2009 by the then Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. The airport was expected to be completed in March 2012. A dispute between the AAI and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) regarding height of the terminal building led to delay in <b>starting</b> <b>air</b> services. AAI authorities constructed the building up to the height of 6.75 meters, whereas MoD had permitted a maximum height of 5 meters. The civil enclave will include a terminal for 100 passengers and a 60 x 90 m apron capable of holding two ATR-72 aircraft. Bikaner Airport construction was completed in August 2013.
