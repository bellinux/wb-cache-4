50|$|<b>Stub</b> <b>switches</b> {{were more}} common in the very early days of {{railways}} and their tramway predecessors. Now, because of their disadvantages, <b>stub</b> <b>switches</b> are used primarily on narrow gauge lines and branch lines. Some modern monorail switches use the same principle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stub</b> <b>switches</b> are {{effectively}} facing {{in both directions}} and must be correctly aligned.|$|R
50|$|In {{areas with}} very low speeds, like depots, and on railroads {{that had to}} be built very cheaply, like logging railroads, {{three-way}} switches were sometimes built as <b>stub</b> <b>switches.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>stub</b> <b>switch</b> {{lacks the}} tapered points (point blades) {{of a typical}} switch. Instead, both the movable rails and {{the ends of the}} rails of the {{diverging}} routes have their ends cut off square. The switch mechanism aligns the movable rails with the rails of one of the diverging routes. In 19th century US railroad use, the <b>stub</b> <b>switch</b> was typically used in conjunction with a harp switch stand.|$|E
50|$|With the new VPLS/MPLS setup; the BigIron RX and legacy BigIron 15000 are {{no longer}} in-use. AMS-IX has {{migrated}} all the hardware to the MPLS-capable MLX platform. <b>Stub</b> <b>switch</b> is either MLX-8, MLX-16 or MLX-32.|$|E
50|$|AMS-IX members {{connect to}} the {{platform}} with 1, 10, 100 Gbit/s Ethernet connections, or using multiple gigabit or 10 gigabit aggregated ports, utilizing the 802.3ad standard. Gigabit Ethernet and lower speed ports are directly connected to Brocade - Foundry Networks BigIron 15000 or RX-8 network switches. 10 gigabit member ports are connected to Glimmerglass Systems photonic switches which maintain an optical connection to the <b>stub</b> <b>switch</b> on the currently active side of the network, following the VSRP protocol. For each 10-gigabit port there is an active and a backup <b>stub</b> <b>switch,</b> for which BigIron RX-8, RX-16 or NetIron MLX-16 switches are used. The core consists of two Brocade NetIron MLX-32 switches, to which all edge switches are connected using 10 gigabit aggregated connections and WDM technology.|$|E
50|$|The points (switch rails or point blades) are the movable rails which {{guide the}} wheels towards either the {{straight}} or the diverging track. They are tapered on most <b>switches,</b> but on <b>stub</b> <b>switches</b> they have square ends.|$|R
50|$|One {{advantage}} to <b>stub</b> <b>switches</b> {{is that they}} work better in the snow. The sideways action of the point rails pushes snow to the side, instead of packing the snow between the points and the rail in a more modern design.|$|R
2500|$|Equipment {{was never}} modernized, and the {{railroad}} used antique <b>stub</b> <b>switches</b> and link-and-pin couplers {{to the end}} of operations in 1943.

50|$|The rails {{leading up}} to a <b>stub</b> <b>switch</b> are not secured to the {{sleepers}} for several feet, and rail alignment across the gap is not positively enforced. Stub switches also require some flexibility in the rails (meaning lighter rails), or an extra joint at which they hinge. Therefore, these switches cannot be traversed at high speed or by heavy traffic and so are not suitable for main line use. A further disadvantage is that a <b>stub</b> <b>switch</b> being approached from the diverging route that is not connected by the points {{would result in a}} derailment. Yet another disadvantage is that in very hot weather, expansion of the steel in the rails can cause the movable rails to stick to the stock rails, making switching impossible until the rails have cooled and contracted.|$|E
50|$|A harp {{switch stand}} {{is a type}} of {{railroad}} switch stand that was most common during the 19th century in the United States. The name derives from the characteristic shape of the stand. The harp stand was typically used in conjunction with the <b>stub</b> <b>switch.</b> It remained in use longest among narrow gauge railroads such as the Denver & Rio Grande well into the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — An {{amphibian}} antenna {{was constructed}} that {{is capable of}} radiating both above and below the surface of water. The antenna is effectively a dual band PIFA design where each radiating element is tuned to resonate in close proximity of either air or water.

The antenna was designed to operate at 433 MHz and good input impedance was observed in both simulation and measurement for both environments.

40|$|Repoint is a {{new concept}} for track {{switching}} developed at Loughborough University. Through a novel locking arrangement it allows parallel, multi-channel actuation and passive locking functions, providing {{a high degree of}} fault tolerance. The concept, based around a <b>stub</b> <b>switch,</b> offers several features that current designs are unable to achieve. The aim of the work presented in this paper is to evaluate the dynamic interaction forces due to the passage of rolling stock over the switch and, particularly, the area of the stub rail ends, in comparison to a conventional switch. Specific behaviour and load transfer conditions from one rail to the other at the joint are analysed, as well as long term wear conditions of the rails. These evaluations are undertaken by means of dynamic simulations, leading to design refinement of the stub rail ends...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{performance}} of a state-of-the- art broadband (60 to 90 GHz, 40 %) millimeter-wave FET asymmetrical switch, realized in a metamorphic high electron mobility transistor (mHEMT) technology. The switch is dedicated to wireless communication or radiometry applications. It makes use of a single control voltage which simultaneously toggles between states. The two signal paths are asymmetrical, one using a series FET, the other a shunt-FET, and exhibit insertion losses of 2. 8 and 1. 7 dB, respectively. Broadband operation is achieved by introduction of matching <b>stubs</b> at each <b>switch</b> branch input...|$|R

This thesis discusses RF dielectric spectroscopy of fluids using microstrip line and coplanar waveguide {{as well as}} the use of RF fluids in passive RF circuits. The use of liquids as a tuning element and as a coolant is not very well explored. In this work different liquids are analyzed for its dielectric properties and its tuning capability. Several passive tuning circuits have been designed and developed, for example a tunable bandstop filter that uses liquids to shift the λ/ 4 resonance modes of the stub. In addition a patch antenna with the tunable liquid stub that uses the open end effect of the <b>stub</b> as a <b>switch</b> is fabricated and studied...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a submillimeter-wave 500 – 550 -GHz MEMS-reconfigurable phase shifter, {{which is based}} on loading a micromachined rectangular waveguide with 9 E-plane stubs. The phase shifter uses MEMS-reconfigurable surfaces to individually block/unblock the E-plane stubs from the micromachined waveguide. Each MEMS-reconfigurable surface is designed so that in the nonblocking state, it allows the electromagnetic wave to pass freely through it into the stub, while in the blocking state, it serves as the roof of the main waveguide and blocks the wave propagation into the stub. The phase-shifter design comprises three micromachined chips that are mounted in the H-plane cuts of the rectangular waveguide. Experimental results of the first device prototypes show that the microelectromechanical system (MEMS) -reconfigurable phase shifter has a linear phase shift of 20 ° in ten discrete steps (3. 3 bits). The measured insertion loss is better than 3  dB, of which only 0. 5 – 1. 5  dB is attributed to the MEMS surfaces and <b>switched</b> <b>stubs,</b> and the measured return loss is better than 15  dB in the design frequency band of 500 – 550  GHz. It is also shown that the major part of the insertion loss is attributed to misalignment and assembly uncertainties of the micromachined chips and the waveguide flanges, shown by simulations and reproducibility measurements. The MEMS-reconfigurable phase shifter is also operated in an analog tuning mode for high phase resolution. Furthermore, a detailed study has been carried out identifying the reason for the discrepancy between the simulated (90 °) and the measured (20 °) phase shift. Comb-drive actuators with spring constant variations between 2. 13 and 8. 71  N/m are used in the phase shifter design. An actuation voltage of 21. 94  V with a reproducibility better than σ= 0. 0503  V is measured for the actuator design with a spring constant of 2. 13  N/m. Reliability measurement on this actuator was performed in an uncontrolled laboratory environment and showed no deterioration in the functioning of the actuator observed over one hundred million cycles.
