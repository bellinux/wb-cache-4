500|$|An {{episode of}} Remington Steele that was filmed in Ireland {{generated}} significant publicity. One outcome was that Brosnan met his father, {{who had left}} when Brosnan was an infant, in a brief get-together at his hotel. Brosnan said he expected to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> tall man, but described his father as [...] "a man of medium stature, pushed-back silver hair, flinty eyes and a twizzled jaw. He {{had a very strong}} Kerry accent." [...] Brosnan was regretful that they met under such public circumstances. He said he would have preferred more private arrangements that would have given him the opportunity to speak privately with his father.|$|E
500|$|Producer Bryan Kirkwood {{said that}} he thought Dawson was a [...] "brilliant actor", and added, [...] "Ashley's {{one of those people}} that can do comedy and pathos within the blink of an eye". Kirkwood said that [...] "Darren's one of my {{favourite}} characters". Fellow producer Paul Marquess spoke positively of Dawson's performance in an interview with Digital Spy, stating, [...] "I think Ashley Taylor Dawson, who plays Darren, is a really strong actor, {{and by the end of}} this year we'll <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> different side to his character". Co-star Kieron Richardson commented on Dawson's performance as Darren, calling Dawson one of the serial's [...] "strongest actors", adding that Dawson compelled him to watch when he was on screen. Richardson added that Dawson [...] "makes me laugh, he does comedy really well and he does vulnerability really well".|$|E
500|$|Zimmerman and {{his team}} took {{feedback}} from the directors of previous Star Trek series to make the new space easier in which to film. Whereas in other series there has been purpose built sets for briefing rooms, following the feedback this area was built into the bridge itself as the directors had stated that it proved difficult to make several people sit around a table seem interesting. The transporter design {{was intended as a}} reference to the original series design that was created by Matt Jefferies, with Zimmerman including certain design elements such as the wall patterns around the transporter itself. The design of the engineering deck was overhauled from previous series with the intention for it to look like the engine room of a nuclear submarine. Zimmerman described it saying, [...] "You're going to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> powerful engine that looks like a very powerful engine." ...|$|E

I leaned out to <b>see.</b> <b>A</b> <b>very</b> fiery young man was making a speech from a soapbox on the corner. A little knot of men, women, and {{children}} had collected about him. He was pointing up at my window — at me. He was saying things about us. I strained to hear... 'Municipal Ownership is no solution,' he cried, 'so long as the propertied classes own the municipalities. J.G. Phelps Stokes is a rich man — a man of property; he belongs to the capitalist class. The Municipal Ownership League is a rich man's creation. W.R. Hearst belongs in the millionaire class. This is his government. He doesn't {{want to change the}} government. The Socialist Party, the workers' party, and what we want is a government of, for, and by the people who work.' 'Hear, hear!' I called down, leaning far out of the window and clapping my hands.|$|E

They <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> old King Caspian setting sail to search for Aslan one last time, but fail to realise who he is until it is too late, and are unable to speak to him. However, the elderly Lord Regent, Trumpkin the Dwarf, takes them to Cair Paravel. There they are aided by Master Glimfeather the Owl and a Parliament of his fellow talking owls (a pun on Chaucer's Parlement of Foules, and a nod toward [...] "parliament" [...] as a {{collective}} noun for owls, as [...] "exaltation" [...] is for larks). The owls explain that Rilian disappeared while searching for the green serpent that killed his mother; they {{believe that he is}} now under the spell of an enchantress he had seen in the forest while searching for the serpent. As Jill and Eustace journey toward the far north of Narnia, they acquire a companion and guide, a gloomy but stalwart Marsh-wiggle, fittingly named Puddleglum (or [...] "the wet blanket").|$|E
2500|$|In 1937, King visited Germany and {{met with}} Adolf Hitler. [...] Possessing a {{religious}} yearning for direct insight into the hidden mysteries {{of life and the}} universe, and strongly influenced by the operas of Richard Wagner (who was also Hitler's favourite composer), King decided Hitler was akin to mythical Wagnerian heroes within whom good and evil were struggling. He thought that good would eventually triumph and Hitler would redeem his people and lead them to a harmonious, uplifting future. These spiritual attitudes not only guided Canada's relations with Hitler but gave the prime minister the comforting sense of a higher mission, that of helping to lead Hitler to peace. King commented in his journal that [...] "he is really one who truly loves his fellow-men, and his country, and would make any sacrifice for their good". [...] He forecast that [...] "the world will yet come to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> great man–mystic in Hitler... I cannot abide in Nazism– the regimentation– cruelty– oppression of Jews– attitude towards religion, etc., but Hitler... will rank some day with Joan of Arc among the deliverers of his people." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} poems which show a much softer {{side to the}} Icelandic male characters. [...] One of these is in chapter 55 when King Æthelstan {{acknowledges}} the death of Egil's brother, Thorolf's, caused by the King's error in judgement. Egil thanks the king {{with a number of}} praise poems showing how considerate and generous the king is. [...] We <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> different side of Egil in chapter 56 when he declares his secret love for his future wife, in a love poem. In chapters 60-62, Egil is confronted with a situation where he must greet King Eirik, with whom he is on bad terms. King Eirik wants Egil dead and at the urging of his friend Arinbjörn, Egil composes a drápa (one of the most complicated forms of poetry) of 20 stanzas praising the king. Thanks to the poem, Egil is allowed to leave Eiríkr's court alive, since killing him would make Eiríkr look like a fool. In chapter 80, Egil composes another praise poem of 25 stanzas expressing his gratitude towards his lifelong friend Arinbjörn for saving his life in his meeting with King Eiríkr. These more positive poems show us a kinder side to the typically rough and violent people of Egils saga.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] was filmed in Santa Barbara, California, in July 2010, and was {{directed}} by Yoann Lemoine. Perry planned the concept along with the songwriters during the sessions. Pictures from the shoot feature Perry kneeling in the sand looking at a man (played by Josh Kloss) wearing speedos, while others show her kissing the man in a hotel pool. She commented about the filming on her Twitter, saying, [...] "That's a wrap for Teenage Dream! So gorgeous [...] In my hometown. I got to cast all my friends in the new music vid for Teenage Dream = amazing insanity." [...] The video features images of Perry {{in a car with}} a boyfriend, then, Perry is shown in a Party with her friends, and the closing scene shows Perry kissing her boyfriend under the water. Perry was interviewed online via YouTube, where she talked about the music video. She said: [...] "It is gonna be completely different from 'California Gurls.' With 'Teenage Dream' you'll <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> raw, almost vulnerable ..... I had to wear so many less layers of makeup. I had to make out with a boy which was very traumatizing, I was kind of mean to him. I would be the one to call cut because I was like, 'oh I can't do this!' I feel so horrible.
