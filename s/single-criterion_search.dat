40|$|Traditionally the Genetic Algorithm (GA) relies {{upon the}} {{evaluation}} of a single fitness criterion to guide the progress of a search through a multi-variate parameter space. However, many complex GA applications, such as the choice of design options to produce a novel environment, require the search to be directed {{by more than one}} criterion. Existing solutions implement such multi-criteria applications by heavily constraining the parameter space on the basis of <b>single-criterion</b> <b>search</b> results; a process which is both slow and complex. In contrast, this project investigates the possibilities of controlling a GA by evaluating a set of fitness criteria so allowing multi-criteria search to be carried out in one pass and on an unconstrained search space. Five potential multi-criteria search methods are introduced, two based upon findings in existing literature and three developed within the project. Three of these methods are compared statistically by monitoring their application to a real world, non-trivial, engineering design problem. This application requires the GA to simultaneously optimise the design model for one criterion and calibrate the design model based upon the values of two others. Results show that all three analysed methods achieve this aim and rate the Constrained Crossover method, an extension of J. D. Schaffer's Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm, as being the most successful. Further work is suggested in order to evaluate and monitor the actions of the statistically analysed methods and to progress with the remaining unanalysed methods, both of which exhibit considerable potential...|$|E
