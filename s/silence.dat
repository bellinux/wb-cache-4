In December 2011, Scorsese stated that <b>Silence</b> would be his next film. By March, although he originally put it on the back burner and consequently dropped out, Scorsese signed back on to The Wolf of Wall Street and opted to direct it ahead of <b>Silence.</b> However, at the time, Scorsese's publicist stated that <b>Silence</b> would come first.

40|$|Transgenes {{inserted}} into the plant genome can become inactive (gene <b>silencing)</b> or result in <b>silencing</b> of homologous cellular genes [homology-dependent gene <b>silencing</b> (HDG <b>silencing)</b> ]. In an earlier study we reported HDG <b>silencing</b> of chalcone synthase (CHS) in Arabidopsis. This study concerns genetic revertants {{of one of the}} CHS HDG-silencing transgenic homozygotes. Two monogenic recessive trans-acting mutations (hog 1 and ddm 1) that impair gene <b>silencing</b> and HDG <b>silencing</b> were identified. These mutations reduce genomic DNA methylation and affect the quantity and size of CHS mRNA. These results imply that DNA methylation is necessary for both gene <b>silencing</b> and HDG <b>silencing.</b> Two further monogenic, trans-acting, recessive mutations (sil 1 and sil 2) reduce gene <b>silencing</b> but not HDG <b>silencing.</b> The existence of this mutant class shows that gene <b>silencing</b> involves genes that are not necessary for HDG <b>silencing.</b> A further mutant (Catt) was isolated and has an attenuated HDG-silencing T-DNA...|$|R

40|$|RNA-mediated gene <b>silencing</b> {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} in plants, animals, and more recently in filamentous fungi. Here, we report high frequency, RNA-mediated gene <b>silencing</b> in the apple scab fungus, Venturia inaequalis. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene was <b>silenced</b> in a GFP-expressing transformant. An endogenous gene, trihydroxynaphthalene reductase (THN), involved in melanin biosynthesis, was also <b>silenced.</b> <b>Silencing</b> of these two genes resulted in obvious phenotypes in vitro. High frequency gene <b>silencing</b> was achieved using hairpin constructs for the GFP or the THN genes transferred by Agrobacterium (71 and 61 %, respectively). THN-silenced transformants exhibited a distinctive light brown phenotype and maintained the ability to infect apple. Of significance was the simultaneous <b>silencing</b> of the two genes from a single chimeric, inverted repeat hairpin construct. <b>Silencing</b> of both genes with this construct occurred at a frequency of 51 % of all the transformants. All 125 colonies <b>silenced</b> for the GFP gene were also <b>silenced</b> for THN. As THN and GFP <b>silenced</b> transformants have readily detectable phenotypes, the genes have utility as markers for gene <b>silencing.</b> Simultaneous, multiple gene <b>silencing,</b> utilising such marker genes, will enable the development of high through-put screening for functional genomics. This chimeric technology will be particularly valuable when linked with <b>silenced</b> genes that have no obvious phenotype in vitro. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|RNA <b>silencing</b> is an {{evolutionary}} conserved sequence-specific gene inactivation mechanism {{that contributes to}} the control of development, maintains heterochromatin, acts in stress responses, DNA repair and defends against invading nucleic acids like transposons and viruses. In plants RNA <b>silencing</b> functions as one of the main immune systems.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we studied {{various aspects of}} siRNA {{mediated}} <b>silencing.</b> siRNA mediated <b>silencing</b> is initiated {{by the introduction of}} dsRNA, transgenes and viral infection. Our first goal was to study the ability of the core pathway of RNA <b>silencing</b> to explain transgene and dsRNA induced <b>silencing.</b> To that extend we developed and studied concise models of the RNA <b>silencing</b> pathway. Secondly, we investigated the efficacy of RNA <b>silencing</b> to reduce viral infections, and added a replicating RNA virus. While we initially studied antiviral <b>silencing</b> within the cell, we extended our study to tissue level dynamics and symptom development in plants. Finally, we added virus encoded <b>silencing</b> suppressors and studied the effect and capability of the different <b>silencing</b> suppressors. We found that the available knowledge about the RNA <b>silencing</b> pathway was not sufficient to explain transgene induced <b>silencing.</b> We proposed mechanisms that could result in transgene induced <b>silencing</b> and recently the existence of these mechanisms has been confirmed experimentally. Our detailed model of both intra- and inter-cellular dynamics gives an explanation for the observed patterns on plant leaves that occur during viral infection. These patterns can have the form of local spots, concentric circles, or resemble mosaic-like patterns. We have shown that models studies are indispensable to understand complex cellular pathways. On the one hand we have shown that the generally accepted pathway of RNA <b>silencing</b> was insufficient to explain the experimental findings on transgene induced <b>silencing</b> it was supposed to explain. On the other hand we have shown that the interaction of RNA <b>silencing</b> and viral growth is indeed able to generate infection patterns for which the link to RNA <b>silencing</b> was still tentative...|$|R
40|$|RNA <b>silencing</b> is an {{essential}} antiviral defense system in plants. Triggered by doublestranded RNA, <b>silencing</b> results in degradation or translational repression of target RNA. Viruses are inducers and targets of RNA <b>silencing.</b> To condition susceptibility, most plant viruses encode <b>silencing</b> suppressor proteins that interfere with RNA <b>silencing.</b> Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) NSs protein is an RNA <b>silencing</b> suppressor. The mechanism of RNA <b>silencing</b> suppression by NSs {{and its role in}} virus infection and movement remain to be determined. We cloned NSs from the Hawaii isolate of TSWV.

40|$|We showed {{previously}} that grafting transmitted <b>silencing</b> {{occurred when}} transgenic ACC oxidase 1 (ACO 1) overexpressing tomato plants that also produced siRNAs were grafted onto transgenic stocks that already showed strong <b>silencing.</b> The presence of siRNAs in these overexpressing scions {{may indicate that}} <b>silencing,</b> though inefficient, may already occur at a low level before grafting. To test if a <b>silencing</b> state with a relatively high level of target mRNA can be shifted towards further more effective <b>silencing,</b> we grafted an ACO 1 antisense (AS) line {{with a high level}} of antisense ACO 1 transgene mRNA and low level of siRNAs to the ACO 1 strong silencer stock. The AS mRNA level was reduced dramatically two weeks after grafting. More interestingly, self-grafting of ACO 1 overexpressers and AS lines also induced strong <b>silencing</b> in the scions. We suggest that grafting transmitted <b>silencing</b> may involve the switching from an inefficient or weak <b>silencing</b> state to a stronger <b>silencing</b> by a systemic <b>silencing</b> signal, similar to the change of <b>silencing</b> states that sometimes occurs during development. Control experiments using non-transgenic stocks designed to test whether wounding alone is responsible for generating a signal that enhances <b>silencing</b> in transgenic scions gave negative results.

40|$|Transcriptional <b>silencing</b> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{occurs at}} the silent mating-type loci HML and HMR, at telomeres, and at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus RDN 1. <b>Silencing</b> in the rDNA occurs by a novel {{mechanism}} that depends on a single Silent Information Regulator (SIR) gene, SIR 2. SIR 4, essential for other <b>silenced</b> loci, paradoxically inhibits rDNA <b>silencing.</b> In this study, we elucidate a regulatory mechanism for rDNA <b>silencing</b> based on the finding that rDNA <b>silencing</b> strength directly correlates with cellular Sir 2 protein levels. The endogenous level of Sir 2 p was shown to be limiting for rDNA <b>silencing.</b> Furthermore, small changes in Sir 2 p levels altered rDNA <b>silencing</b> strength. In rDNA <b>silencing</b> phenotypes, sir 2 mutations were shown to be epistatic to sir 4 mutations, indicating that SIR 4 inhibition of rDNA <b>silencing</b> is mediated through SIR 2. Furthermore, rDNA <b>silencing</b> is insensitive to SIR 3 overexpression, but is severely reduced by overexpression of full-length Sir 4 p or a fragment of Sir 4 p that interacts with Sir 2 p. This negative effect of SIR 4 overexpression was overridden by co-overexpression of SIR 2, suggesting that SIR 4 directly inhibits the rDNA <b>silencing</b> function of SIR 2. Finally, genetic manipulations of SIR 4 previously shown to promote extended life span also resulted in enhanced rDNA <b>silencing.</b> We propose a simple model in which telomeres act as regulators of rDNA <b>silencing</b> by competing for limiting amounts of Sir 2 protein...|$|R

Green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been widely used as a visual reporter to study RNA <b>silencing</b> and viral-mediated suppression of RNA <b>silencing</b> in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. In transgenic N. benthamiana plants expressing an endoplasmic reticulum targeted GFP variant (16 c) known as mGFP 5, RNA <b>silencing</b> can be induced by ectopic over-expression of mGFP 5. However, other GFP variants {{can also be used to}} induce GFP <b>silencing</b> in these plants. We compared the efficiency to induce local and systemic <b>silencing</b> of two commonly used GFP variants: enhanced GFP (eGFP) and mGFP 5. Using lettuce necrotic yellows virus (LNYV) P protein to suppress GFP <b>silencing,</b> we demonstrate that eGFP gene, which is 76 % identical at the nucleotide level to the endogenously expressed mGFP 5 in 16 c plants, triggers <b>silencing</b> more slowly and concurrently prolongs detectable <b>silencing</b> suppressor activity of the weak LNYV P suppressor, compared to the homologous mGFP 5 gene. The use of eGFP as RNA <b>silencing</b> inducer in wild type or 16 c plants appears to be a useful tool in identifying and analysing weak viral RNA <b>silencing</b> suppressor proteins whose activity might otherwise have been masked when challenged by a stronger RNA <b>silencing</b> response.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the experience of}} applying of The <b>Silences</b> Framework to underpin health research investigating Tuberculosis/HIV/AIDS coinfection. Method: The <b>Silences</b> Framework originally developed following a study exploring the decisions and <b>silences</b> surrounding black Caribbean men living in England, discussing the themes 'sexual health' and 'ethnicity'. Following this study a conceptual a theory for research on sensitive issues and health care of marginalized populations was developed called 'Screaming Silences' which forms the foundation of The <b>Silences</b> Framework. Screaming <b>Silences</b> define research areas and experiences that are poorly studied, little understood or <b>silenced.</b> Results: The <b>Silences</b> Framework supports researchers in revealing "silences" in the subjects they study - as such results may reflect how beliefs, values, and experiences of some groups influence their health.

40|$|Abstract Background PTGS (post-transcriptional gene <b>silencing)</b> is used {{to counter}} {{pathogenic}} invasions, particularly viruses. In return, many plant viruses produce proteins which suppress <b>silencing</b> directed against their RNA. The diversity of <b>silencing</b> suppression at the species level in natural hosts is unknown. Results We investigated the functional diversity of <b>silencing</b> suppression among isolates of the African RYMV (Rice yellow mottle virus) in rice. The RYMV-P 1 protein is responsible for cell-to-cell movement and is a <b>silencing</b> suppressor. Transgenic gus -silencing rice lines were used to investigate intra-specific and serogroup <b>silencing</b> suppression diversity at two different levels: that of the virion and the P 1 <b>silencing</b> suppressor protein. Our data provide evidence that <b>silencing</b> suppression is a universal phenomenon for RYMV species. However, we found considerable diversity {{in their ability to}} suppress <b>silencing</b> which was not linked to RYMV phylogeny, or pathogenicity. At the level of the <b>silencing</b> suppressor P 1 alone, we found similar results to those previously found at the virion level. In addition, we showed that cell-to-cell movement of P 1 was crucial for the efficiency of <b>silencing</b> suppression. Mutagenesis of P 1 demonstrated a strong link between some amino acids and <b>silencing</b> suppression features with, one on the hand, the conserved amino acids C 95 and C 64 involved in cell-to-cell movement and the strength of suppression, respectively, and on the other hand, the non conserved F 88 was involved in the strength of <b>silencing</b> suppression.

40|$|Viral {{infection}} in both plant and invertebrate hosts requires a virus-encoded function {{to block the}} RNA <b>silencing</b> antiviral defense. Here, we report the identification and characterization of three distinct suppressors of RNA <b>silencing</b> encoded by the ≈ 20 -kb plus-strand RNA genome of citrus tristeza virus (CTV). When introduced by genetic crosses into plants carrying a <b>silencing</b> transgene, both p 20 and p 23, but not coat protein (CP), restored expression of the transgene. Although none of the CTV proteins prevented DNA methylation of the transgene, export of the <b>silencing</b> signal (capable of mediating intercellular <b>silencing</b> spread) was detected only from the F 1 plants expressing p 23 and not from the CP- or p 20 -expressing F 1 plants, demonstrating suppression of intercellular <b>silencing</b> by CP and p 20 but not by p 23.
