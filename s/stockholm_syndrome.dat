5|$|The {{taxi driver}} and his {{companion}} hold Homer hostage {{deep into the}} rainforest. They force Homer {{to make a phone}} call to Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 dollars to the kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons do not have enough money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a Teleboobies float with characters from the show. Lisa is surprised to discover that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from Teleboobies—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers a scrapbook he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars. The Simpsons toss the kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an anaconda. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.|$|E

25|$|Usually the victim's {{fears are}} based in reality, as she may lack the social support, {{financial}} means, or may be too physically or emotionally disabled to survive on her own. Victims may have low self-esteem, suffer from <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> and are often {{led to believe that}} the abuse is their fault, that they deserved it, and, due to misplaced feelings of loyalty, or fear of retaliation from their abuser, may be unwilling to press charges against their abuser.|$|E
25|$|Hearst's {{attorney}} F. Lee Bailey {{used the}} <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Syndrome</b> argument {{as part of}} the defense at trial. During Hearst's subsequent trial, her lawyer claimed that she had been confined in a closet barely large enough for her to lie down in; that her {{contact with the outside world}} was regulated by her captors; and that she was regularly threatened with execution. Hearst's lawyer contended that she had been raped by DeFreeze and Wolfe. Both died before Hearst's capture and trial. The SLA claimed to be holding Hearst according to the conditions of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
25|$|Children are {{especially}} vulnerable to these developmental and psychological consequences of trafficking due to their age. In order to gain complete control of the child, traffickers often destroy {{physical and mental health}} of the children through persistent physical and emotional abuse. Victims experience severe trauma on a daily basis that devastates the healthy development of self-concept, self-worth, biological integrity, and cognitive functioning. Children who grow up in constant environments of exploitation frequently exhibit antisocial behavior, over-sexualized behavior, self-harm, aggression, distrust of adults, dissociative disorders, substance abuse, complex trauma, and attention deficit disorders. <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome</b> is also a common problem for girls while they are trafficked, which can hinder them from both trying to escape, and moving forward in psychological recovery programs.|$|E
25|$|In Trauma and Recovery, Herman {{expresses the}} {{additional}} concern that patients {{who suffer from}} C-PTSD frequently risk being misunderstood as inherently 'dependent', 'masochistic', or 'self-defeating', comparing this attitude to the historical misdiagnosis of female hysteria. However, those who develop C-PTSD do so {{as a result of the}} intensity of the trauma bond – in which someone becomes tightly biolo-chemically bound to someone who abuses them (also known as <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Syndrome</b> – seen in cases of kidnapping in which a person falls in love with their captors) and the responses they learned to survive, navigate and deal with the abuse they suffered then become automatic responses, imbedded in their personality over the years of trauma – a normal reaction to an abnormal situation.|$|E

500|$|Developed as a {{recurring}} character, Christy {{has been noted}} as a [...] "source of fandom controversy" [...] over the exact definition of her morality. When discussing Christy's kidnapping and subsequent imprisonment by demons, Kern {{raised the question of}} whether or not she was experiencing a form of <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome.</b> He cited the nature versus nurture debate as one of the factors behind the development of the character. Kern said the character returned to: [...] " [...] we've played with and toyed with and worked every way possible over the last eight years, and [...] we would like to return to it." ...|$|E

[...] On February22, 2010, Cary Elwes was {{listed on the}} Toronto Film & Television's {{official}} list of personnel website for Saw 3D but on March 8 his name along with other cast members {{were removed from the}} list. [...] The following month, Lionsgate confirmed his reprisal of the role of Lawrence Gordon, last seen in the first film. Dunstan and Melton said that Elwes filmed new scenes. [...] The filmmakers wanted to bring Elwes back earlier, but Elwes wanted to wait until the last film. He described his character as having <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome.</b> [...] Chad Donella appeared in the film as Internal Affairs Detective Gibson, who was also Hoffman's former partner.|$|E
500|$|On May 12, 2009, Webb sent {{a message}} to his email mailing list stating that his next album <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Syndrome</b> was deemed too {{controversial}} for his record label to release. [...] "It seems I've finally found the line beyond which my label can support me, and apparently I've crossed it," [...] Webb writes. [...] "t this point we're not sure when the record will come out and in what form. The majority of the controversy is surrounding one song, which I consider to be among the most important songs on the record …. ecause of various legal/publishing issues we're having to be rather careful with how we do what we're going to do next.".|$|E
500|$|At a {{press conference}} on February 28, 2011, Tapson said that Nancy and Phillip Garrido had both made a 'full confession' in the case. The {{development}} came as lawyers for both sides re-opened discussions on a possible plea deal that {{had the potential to}} obviate the need for a trial. Nancy's attorney acknowledged that she was facing [...] "241 years, eight months to life" [...] and that he was working for a reduced sentence in the 30-year range. He stated that the prosecutor had acknowledged that Phillip was a master manipulator and that Nancy was under both his influence and that of substances during the period of Dugard's kidnapping, so should receive some consideration while alluding to parallels with kidnap victim Patty Hearst and to <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "Nisei" [...] and [...] "731", show {{a darker}} {{side to the}} series, {{exploring}} the public's distrust in the government. Other episodes dealing with the wider mythology of the series—"Talitha Cumi", [...] "Piper Maru" [...] and [...] "Apocrypha"—explore similar concepts, showcasing the shadow government plot line of the series. Episodes like [...] "2Shy" [...] and [...] "Pusher" [...] feature sadistic villains, containing human beings capable of highly immoral acts despite their seemingly mundane appearances. Another episode with a serial killer antagonist, [...] "Grotesque", revolves around the way that evil can change and influence people. [...] "Oubliette" [...] offers a sentimental and emotional plot driven by the kidnapping of a young girl. [...] The episode features parallels to the real life Polly Klaas case and provides commentary on both <b>stockholm</b> <b>syndrome</b> and trauma.|$|E
500|$|The eighth series {{sees the}} return of Oleg Darshavin, one of Lucas's former interrogators during his imprisonment. During his interrogations, Lucas had {{developed}} <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and his interrogator had managed to deconstruct him {{almost to the point}} of being turned and wanting to die. Lucas also becomes involved with CIA liaison officer Sarah Caufield. The initial power struggle between them ends up in a [...] "torrid love affair," [...] which is monitored by the team. When Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker) returns in the series, Lucas [...] "really takes control of her position", in a similar manner to Harry and Ros's actions during Lucas's return. Armitage described Lucas's friendship with Ros as a [...] "good combo"; while Lucas likes to play the [...] "" [...] with [...] "all guns blazing" [...] Ros would [...] "slip around the back and silently slit a throat." ...|$|E

The parole officer eventually called the Concord police. Upon the arrival of a police sergeant, Garrido admitted he had kidnapped and raped her. Only after this did Dugard identify herself as Jaycee Dugard. It was later suggested that Dugard was beginning to show signs of <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome.</b> In a 2016 interview with Diane Sawyer of ABC News, Dugard stated that her compassion and willingness to interact with her captor were only means of surviving. Dugard: [...] "The phrase [...] implies that hostages cracked by terror and abuse become affectionate towards their captors." [...] "Well it's, really, it's degrading, you know, having my family believe that I was in love with this captor and wanted to stay with him. I mean, that is so far from the truth that {{it makes me want to}} throw up. ...I adapted to survive my circumstance." [...] said Dugard. Repeatedly during this segment of the interview she states that, as a way to survive, and hoping to end abuse, many victims are forced to sympathize with their captors.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fourth}} {{episode of the}} eighth series, Oleg Darshavin, who {{had been one of}} Lucas's interrogators in Russia, {{approaches}} him for help in stopping a planned bombing by Sudanese extremists; Lucas takes the case despite Harry's suspicion that he developed <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome</b> during his captivity. Harry's suspicions are solidified when Lucas goes off-piste, but ultimately, Lucas is able to bring Darshavin in and takes him into FSB custody after uncovering his involvement in the plot, while Ros stops the bomb. During the same series, Lucas conducts an affair with CIA liaison Sarah Caufield (Genevieve O'Reilly), who is later revealed to be an operative of [...] "Nightingale", a multinational shadow organisation bent on a New World Order. When he discovers this and confronts Sarah about her involvement, she flees. She returns in the series eight finale, and before she is assassinated, she reveals that Nightingale is attempting to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan. In the end, Lucas and Ros go to a hotel rigged to explode, set up by Nightingale, to save Pakistan President Mudasser and Home Secretary Andrew Lawrence before the building explodes; Lucas rescues Mudasser, who calls off the impending war, but Ros is killed in the explosion before she can get Lawrence to safety.|$|E
500|$|Young Adult Library Services Association {{placed the}} first volume of Arisa on its list of [...] "Great Graphic Novels for Teens" [...] for 2011. About.com's Deb Aoki {{reviewed}} {{the first volume}} of Arisa positively, praising it as [...] "compelling" [...] and [...] "a much darker tale" [...] than Ando's previous work Kitchen Princess; she later placed Arisa on her 2010 list of the [...] "Best New Manga" [...] for the shōjo category. Otaku USA magazine's Danica Davidson agreed that the plot was darker than Kitchen Princess and described the artwork as [...] "pretty and cutesy". According to Matthew Warner of Mania Entertainment, the initially cliched-seeming characters and plain premise helped to provide a [...] "strong contrast" [...] to the main storyline and [...] "the depraved and twisted nature of Arisa's class". While noting the presence of clichés and [...] "plot holes", Carlo Santos of Anime News Network enjoyed the first volume, describing it as [...] "a shoujo-styled Naoki Urasawa thriller, built upon layers of addictive mystery"; he had mixed feelings about her artwork, writing that it conveyed the plot well, but did not possess a distinct artistic style. In her review of the third volume, Rebecca Silverman, another reviewer for Anime News Network, wrote that while the middle-school setting felt believable and the mystery was intriguing, some aspects of the plot were trying on the reader's suspension of disbelief, and the artwork, though usually enjoyable, failed to be convincingly scary during frightening scenes. In her follow-up review of the eleventh and twelfth volumes, Silverman interpreted Arisa as struggling with <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome</b> and wrote that it was unsettling, as by the conclusion, the character still remained in [...] "an emotionally unhealthy (or even abusive) relationship." [...] She enjoyed the suspense and wrote that Midori's backstory sufficed to explain his actions, concluding [...] "Arisa has been a wild ride, an unexpected horror/mystery shoujo gem." ...|$|E

2500|$|One form of {{psychological}} coercion particularly common {{in cases of}} sex trafficking and forced prostitution is <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Many women entering into the sex trafficking industry are minors whom have already experienced prior sexual abuse. Traffickers take advantage of young girls by luring them into the business through force and coercion, but more often through false promises of love, security, and protection. This form of coercion works to recruit and initiate the victim {{into the life of}} a sex worker, while also reinforcing a [...] "trauma bond", also known as <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome.</b> [...] <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a psychological response where the victim becomes attached to his or her perpetrator.|$|E

2500|$|Psychiatrist Bruce Perry {{cites the}} use of holding therapy {{techniques}} by caseworkers and foster parents investigating a Satanic Ritual Abuse case in the late 1980s, early 1990s, as instrumental in obtaining lengthy and detailed alleged [...] "disclosures" [...] from children. In his opinion, using force or coercion on traumatised children simply re-traumatizes them and far from producing love and affection, produces obedience based on fear, as in the trauma bond known as <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The FBI was {{conducting}} an unsuccessful search, and the SLA {{took refuge in}} a number of safe houses. While in the SLA's custody, Hearst later claimed she was subjected to a series of ordeals that her mother would later describe as [...] "brainwashing". The change in Hearst's politics has been attributed to <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome,</b> a psychological response in which a hostage exhibits apparent loyalty to the abductor. Hearst was later examined by specialist psychologist Margaret Singer, who came to the same conclusion.|$|E

During this period, Katy had become extremely attached to Ciarán, and later defended his honour on television and to his family, in what would be described as the effects of <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E

Licio Gelli declared that the presence of numerous members of P2 in the committees was casual, since numerous personalities were members at the time, and this was simply a statistic reflected by the composition of the committees. According to Gelli, some members of the committees did not know that some of their colleagues were also part of P2.|$|E

2500|$|Fangio {{was taken}} to three {{separate}} houses. His captors allowed him {{to listen to the}} race via radio, bringing a television for him to witness reports of a disastrous crash after the race concluded. In the third house, Fangio was allowed his own bedroom but became convinced that a guard was standing outside of the bedroom door at all hours. The captors talked about their revolutionary programme which Fangio had not wished to speak about as he did not have an interest in politics. Convinced that he was not in danger he went on to develop a case of <b>Stockholm</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> admitting afterwards that he sympathised with his captors' actions: [...] "Well, this is one more adventure. If what the rebels did was in a good cause, then I, as an Argentine, accept it." [...] Fangio was released after 29 hours and he remained a good friend of his captors afterwards.|$|E

GamesRadar's Justin Towell called her the third-most difficult game bad guy to kill due to <b>Stockholm</b> <b>syndrome,</b> a syndrome where hostages will bond with their captors. IGN editor Daemon Hatfield described GLaDOS {{as one of the}} most engaging characters to appear in a video game. Cinema Blend featured GLaDOS as the best character of 2007, stating that she [...] "breathes life, emotion, and hilarity into the lab of Portal." [...] GamesRadar praised Portal as having one of the best video game stories ever, citing GLaDOS as the primary reason for this. They stated that she had the most defined personalitiy in gaming, adding that she [...] "redefined passive-aggressive". Shoot 'em up expert Michael Molinari cited GLaDOS as an example of a quality boss, stating that her quality stems from her appearing throughout the game, providing motivation as well as a satisfying pay-off at the end of the game. Editor Randy Smith commented that the battle with GLaDOS was [...] "easy", commenting that it was [...] "fun and fluid" [...] rather than [...] "annoyingly insurmountable". However, he added that it had an [...] "air of epicness". Whereas Smith found the battle easy, UGO Networks Chris Littler included GLaDOS in his list of the 50 [...] "Hardest Freakin' Boss Battles".
