5|$|The Big Bang theory {{depends on}} two major assumptions: the {{universality}} of physical laws and the cosmological principle. The cosmological principle states that on large <b>scales</b> <b>the</b> universe is homogeneous and isotropic.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} {{fundamental}} interactions, gravitation is dominant at cosmological length scales, including galaxies and larger-scale structures. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, {{the effects of}} positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on cosmological length <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> remaining two interactions, the weak and strong nuclear forces, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.|$|E
5|$|Scales in {{the central}} or throat region, which are {{in contact with the}} first ventral scales of a snake's body and are flanked by the chin shields, are called gular <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> mental groove is a {{longitudinal}} groove {{on the underside of the}} head between the large, paired chin shields and continuing between the smaller gular scales.|$|E

50|$|The most {{well known}} <b>scales</b> {{measuring}} <b>the</b> lightfastness are <b>the</b> Blue Wool <b>Scale,</b> Grey <b>scale</b> and <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> defined by ASTM (American Standard Test Measure).

5|$|Work by {{engineer}} Mieczysław G. Bekker {{implies that}} the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is log-normal; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones.

5|$|Aside {{from those}} found on Corythosaurus casuarius, {{extensive}} skin impressions {{have been found}} on Edmontosaurus annectens and notable integument has also been found on Brachylophosaurus canadensis, Gryposaurus notabilis, Parasaurolophus walkeri, Lambeosaurus magnicristatus, L. lambei, Saurolophus angustirsotris and on unidentified ornithopods. Of these, L. lambei, C. casuarius, G. notabilis, P. walkeri, and S. angustirsotris have preserved polygonal <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> scales on L. lambei, S. angustirostris and C. casuarius are all similar. Corythosaurus is one of very few hadrosaurids which have preserved skin impressions on the hind limbs and feet. A study in 2013 showed that amongst hadrosaurids, Saurolophus angustirostris preserved {{the best and most}} complete foot and limb integument, although other species like S. osborni, Edmontosaurus annectens and Lambeosaurus lambei (= L. clavinitialis) share a fair amount of preserved tissue on those regions.|$|E
5|$|Bilins are found, for example, in Micrommata virescens, {{resulting}} in its green color. Guanine {{is responsible for}} the white markings of the European garden spider Araneus diadematus. It is in many species accumulated in specialized cells called guanocytes. In genera such as Tetragnatha, Leucauge, Argyrodes or Theridiosoma, guanine creates their silvery appearance. While guanine is originally an end-product of protein metabolism, its excretion can be blocked in spiders, leading to an increase in its storage. Structural colors occur in some species, which are the result of the diffraction, scattering or interference of light, for example by modified setae or <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> white prosoma of Argiope results from hairs reflecting the light, Lycosa and Josa both have areas of modified cuticle that act as light reflectors.|$|E

The real Blofeld pulls a gun on Bond, and instructs him into a elevator, where he is knocked out by gas. He is picked up by Wint and Kidd, and taken out to Las Vegas Valley, where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. The pipeline is buried the next morning.|$|E

5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii, {{commonly}} known as the slender parasol or graceful parasol, is a species of mushroom-forming fungus in the family Lepiotaceae. The species is found in Australia and New Zealand, where it fruits singly or in small groups on the ground in eucalypt woodlands, parks, and roadsides. It is a tall mushroom up to roughly , with a broad cap covered with distinctive rings of dark brown <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> whitish gills on the cap underside are closely spaced and free from attachment to the slender stipe, which has a loose ring on its upper half, and a bulbous base. The edibility of the mushroom is not known with certainty, but closely related parasol mushrooms are edible and some are very sought after.|$|E

50|$|Observing the {{equation}} above {{it is clear}} to see that while the Reynolds numbers must be equal for <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> model and <b>the</b> prototype, this can be accomplished in many different ways, for example, in this problem by altering <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> of <b>the</b> dynamic viscosity of the model to work with <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> of <b>the</b> length. This means, <b>the</b> <b>scales</b> of different quantities, for example a material's elasticity in <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> model versus <b>the</b> prototype, are governed by equating the dimensionless quantities and <b>the</b> other quantity's <b>scaling</b> within <b>the</b> dimensionless quantity to ensure the dimensionless quantity of interest is of equal magnitude for <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> model and prototype.|$|R

5|$|Recovering uranium and {{plutonium}} from spent {{nuclear fuel}} for reuse {{is one of the}} major processes of the nuclear fuel cycle. As it has a long half-life of just over 2millionyears, the alpha emitter 237Np {{is one of the major}} isotopes of the minor actinides separated from {{spent nuclear fuel}}. Many separation methods have been used to separate out the neptunium, operating on small and large <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> small-scale purification operations have the goals of preparing pure neptunium as a precursor of metallic neptunium and its compounds, and also to isolate and preconcentrate neptunium in samples for analysis.|$|E

5|$|The body of {{the snake}} is subcylindrical, and is taller than it is wide. It has an upper surface that is {{typically}} a shade of blueish gray, while the belly is yellowish, with wide ventral scales that stretch from a third to {{more than half of}} the width of the body. Black rings of about uniform width are present throughout the length of the snake, but the rings narrow or are interrupted at the belly. The midbody is covered with 21 to 25 longitudinal rows of imbricate (overlapping) dorsal <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> tail of the snake is paddle-shaped and adapted to swimming.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} of Tricholoma pardinum is an {{imposing}} mushroom with a pale grey cap up to 15cm (6in) in diameter that {{is covered with}} dark brownish to greyish <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> gills are whitish, and are not attached to the stout white to pale grey-brown stalk. The spore print is white. One of the more toxic members of the genus Tricholoma, the species has been implicated {{in a number of}} episodes of mushroom poisoning, probably because it is a large, attractive mushroom with a pleasant smell and taste, and it bears a superficial resemblance to several edible species, like Tricholoma terreum. Ingesting T.pardinum—even in small quantities—results in a severe, persistent gastroenteritis caused by an unknown mycotoxin.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is fairly}} large and {{distinct}} and its sides are almost flat and vertical. The {{edge of the}} snout is usually raised into a low ridge. Seen from above, the rostral scale is not visible, or only just. Immediately behind the rostral, there are two (rarely one) small scales. Dorsally, there are usually five large plates: a squarish frontal (longer than wide, sometimes rectangular), two parietals (sometimes with a tiny scale between the frontal and the parietals), and two long and narrow supraoculars. The latter are large and distinct, each separated from the frontal by one to four small <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> nostril is situated in a shallow depression within a large nasal scale. The eye is relatively large—equal in size or slightly larger than the nasal scale—but often smaller in females. Below the supraoculars are six to 13 (usually eight to 10) small circumorbital <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> temporal scales are smooth (rarely weakly keeled). There are 10–12 sublabials and six to 10 (usually eight or 9) supralabials. Of the latter, the numbers 3 and 4 are the largest, while 4 and 5 (rarely 3 and 4) are separated from the eye by a single row of small scales (sometimes two rows in alpine specimens).|$|E
