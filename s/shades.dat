40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} and investigate Tiled <b>Shading.</b> The tiled techniques, though simple, enable substantial improvements to both deferred and forward <b>shading.</b> Tiled <b>Shading</b> has previously been talked about {{only in terms of}} deferred <b>shading</b> (Tiled Deferred <b>Shading).</b> We contribute a more detailed description of the technique, introduce Tiled Forward <b>Shading</b> (a generalization of Tiled Deferred <b>Shading</b> to also apply to forward <b>shading),</b> and a thorough performance evaluation. Tiled Forward <b>Shading</b> has many of the advantages of deferred <b>shading,</b> e. g. scene management and light management is decoupled. At the same time, unlike traditional deferred and tiled deferred <b>shading,</b> Full Screen Anti Aliasing and transparency is trivially supported. We also contribute a thorough comparison of the performance of Tiled Deferred, Tiled Forward and traditional deferred <b>shading.</b> Our evaluation shows that Tiled Deferred <b>Shading</b> has the least variable worst case performance, and scales the best with faster GPUs. Tiled Deferred <b>Shading</b> is especially suitable when there are many light sources. Tiled Forward <b>Shading</b> is shown to be competitive for scenes with fewer lights, while being much simpler than traditional forward <b>shading</b> techniques. Tiled <b>shading</b> also enables simple transitioning between deferred and forward <b>shading.</b> We demonstrate how this can be used to handle transparent geometry, frequently a problem when using deferred <b>shading.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{the effects}} of <b>shading</b> after {{pollination}} on kernel filling and physicochemical properties of waxy maize could improve kernel quality. Experiments were conducted to investigate {{the effects of}} <b>shading</b> (30 % and 50 % light deprivation, taken plants without <b>shading</b> as control) on kernel weight, size, and physicochemical properties during kernel development in 2013 and 2014 using two waxy maize varieties (Suyunuo 5 and Yunuo 7). Results indicated that <b>shading</b> reduced kernel filling rate and decreased kernel size and weight, and the influence was large under severe light deprivation conditions. The large reduction in kernel weight and volume of Suyunuo 5 in response to <b>shading</b> indicated {{that it was more}} sensitive to <b>shading</b> than Yunuo 7. Starch content was reduced and protein content was increased by <b>shading,</b> especially under severe <b>shading</b> after 22 days after pollination (DAP). The iodine binding capacity of Yunuo 7 was not affected by <b>shading</b> at fresh and maturity stages but was gradually decreased by <b>shading</b> at the newly formed stage, while the values for Suyunuo 5 were decreased at 7 and 40 DAP only by moderate <b>shading</b> and were similar among three treatments at 22 DAP. Severe <b>shading</b> decreased crystallinity at all kernel development stages, whereas moderate <b>shading</b> decreased crystallinity at fresh stage and increased it at mature stage for Suyunuo 5. Crystallinity in Yunuo 7 was increased by <b>shading</b> at 7 DAP and decreased by <b>shading</b> at 40 DAP, whereas the value at 22 DAP was increased by moderate <b>shading</b> and reduced by severe <b>shading,</b> respectively. The average gelatinization temperatures at different stages were decreased by <b>shading</b> and showed no difference between two <b>shading</b> levels. The retrogradation percentage at 7 DAP for both varieties was increased by <b>shading.</b> The value at 22 DAP was increased by moderate <b>shading</b> for Suyunuo 5 and decreased by severe <b>shading</b> for Yunuo 7, respectively. The retrogradation percentage at 40 DAP was decreased by <b>shading</b> treatments for Suyunuo 5 and reduced only by moderate <b>shading</b> for Yunuo 7. Peak viscosity was decreased by <b>shading</b> at fresh stage for Yunuo 7 and at maturity for Suyunuo 5. In conclusion, <b>shading</b> after pollination inhibited kernel filling of waxy maize and reduced paste viscosity quality, but kernel retrograde quality, crystallinity and starch iodine binding capacity in response to <b>shading</b> were dependent on stage and variety...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Scattered UV {{radiation}} is present underneath <b>shade</b> structures due to scattering by {{the atmosphere and}} surroundings. Therefore, the side openings of a <b>shade</b> structure have a direct influence on where the <b>shade</b> is located {{and the level of}} scattered UV in the <b>shaded</b> area. UV exposures were assessed for the decrease in scattered UV beneath specific <b>shade</b> structures as a result of using two types of side on protection, namely, polycarbonate sheeting and vegetation. Anatomical facial dosimetry measurements conducted in the <b>shade</b> of a scale model <b>shade</b> structure during summer and winter showed significant decreases in UV exposure for summer and for winter when polycarbonate sheeting was added to specific sides of the <b>shade</b> structure. Broadband field measurements conducted in the <b>shade</b> of four <b>shade</b> structures with various amounts of vegetation covering different sides, showed that the positioning of vegetation for side-on protection is vital for decreasing the scattered UV in the <b>shade.</b> Adding suitable vegetation and or polycarbonate sheeting to specific sides of <b>shade</b> structures can significantly reduce scattered UV in the <b>shade</b> compared to <b>shade</b> structures that do not utilise any side-on protection. However, side on protection is of little use if the positioning of the <b>shade</b> structure itself is inadequate. The positioning of the <b>shade</b> structure in respect to full sun activities is of key importance particularly where these activities involve infants and children...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>shade</b> {{on the growth}} and {{development}} of Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) (L.) Pers.) was determined under glasshouse conditions. The plants were grown from shoot propagules in full light, under different layers of green netting (provides 42, 58 and 77 % <b>shade)</b> and under plants canopy {maize (65 % <b>shade)</b> and soybean (67 % <b>shade)</b> } for 42 to 84 days. Results have shown that continuous <b>shading</b> severely {{reduced the number of}} tillers, leaf area, leaf dry weight, stem dry weight, root dry weight and total dry weight of C. dactylon. After 84 days continuous <b>shading,</b> plants grown in 42, 58 and 77 % <b>shade</b> and with maize (65 % <b>shade)</b> or soybean (67 % <b>shade)</b> yielded only 25, 21, 7, 11 and 15 %, respectively as much total dry weight as the plants grown in full light. <b>Shading</b> at later growth stages also reduced growth of C. dactylon but early <b>shading</b> followed by full light at later stages had less <b>shade</b> effect. For example at the final harvest, plants that were transferred from 77 % <b>shade</b> to full light at day 42 after planting had 45 % of the total dry weight of the plants in the continuous full light treatment, but plants transferred from full light to 77 % <b>shade</b> at day 42 had only 27 % as much. Constant <b>shading</b> reduced Dry Matter Production (DMP), Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and Leaf Area Duration (LAD) but increased Leaf Area Ratio (LAR). Plants <b>shaded</b> after 42 days in full light maintained larger LAD then continuously <b>shaded</b> plants but had similar or lower NAR values to them during the <b>shaded</b> period. Early <b>shaded</b> plants had slightly larger NAR than the plants that were maintained continuously in the full light treatment and increased their LAD compared to the continuously <b>shaded</b> plants...|$|R

40|$|There are no {{previous}} studies validating the accuracy and repeatability of ClearMatch photographic <b>shade</b> analysis system. The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare the <b>shade</b> matches performed by a photographic <b>shade</b> analysis system (ClearMatch) with conventional visual <b>shade</b> matching method under simulated clinical conditions. Three <b>shade</b> matching methods were used to match twelve <b>shade</b> tabs under simulated clinical conditions using a Vita Classical <b>shade</b> guide: conventional visual <b>shade</b> matching using 3 human raters (VM – Visual method), photographic <b>shade</b> analysis system (CM - ClearMatch) using two different ways of normalizing the image (CM-A 2 and CM-ref respectively). <b>Shade</b> matching for all methods was completed at two separate sessions. The Kappa statistic was used to determine the intra-rater and inter-rater agreement. CIELAB values of the <b>shade</b> results were used to produce scatter plots as well as to calculate the color difference (delta E) between VM and CM groups. There was no inter-rater agreement between VM and CM-A 2 (k= 0. 000 and k= 0. 015 for the first and second sessions respectively) while VM and CM-ref showed weak agreement (k= 0. 244 and k= 0. 091 respectively). Intra-rater agreement was strong in all groups VM, CM-A 2 and CM-ref (0. 705, 0. 803 and 0. 681 respectively). CM-A 2 had 2 (8. 3 %) <b>shade</b> matches with a delta E of less than 2. 6 (clinically imperceptible), while CM-ref had 12 (50. 0 %) imperceptible matches. CM-A 2 had an additional 16 (66. 6 %) <b>shade</b> matches with delta E of less than 5. 5 (clinically acceptable), while CM-ref had 23 (95. 8 %) additional acceptable matches.
