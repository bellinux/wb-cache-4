The suit by Preserve South Bay was dismissed in March 2001, on the grounds that the legislature did not need to review the annexation of state parkland for the highway because it was done under eminent domain. In April, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the project on several conditions, including monitoring the water quality to ensure that the Sweetwater Reservoir would remain a clean water source for local residents. An appeal to the state Water Resources Control Board to overturn the approval was unsuccessful. In July, the USACE approved the wetlands permit for the southern portion of SR 125.|$|R

For Tönnies, <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>approval</b> is by no means self-evident; he is quite influenced by Thomas Hobbes. Following his [...] "essential will" [...] ("Wesenwille"), an actor will see himself as a means to serve the goals of social grouping; very often it is an underlying, subconscious force. Groupings formed around an essential will are called a Gemeinschaft. The other will is the [...] "arbitrary will" [...] ("Kürwille"): An actor sees a social grouping as a means to further his individual goals; so it is purposive and future-oriented. Groupings around the latter are called Gesellschaft. Whereas the membership in a Gemeinschaft is self-fulfilling, a Gesellschaft is instrumental for its members. In pure sociology [...] - [...] theoretically [...] - , these two normal types of will are to be strictly separated; in applied sociology [...] - [...] empirically [...] - [...] they are always mixed.|$|R

40|$|The global {{perspective}} on digital revolution {{is one that}} has received <b>a</b> rapturous <b>approval</b> from information professionals, scholars and practitioners. However, <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>approval</b> has come at a great cost to memory institutions as the preservation of digital information {{has proved to be a}} complex phenomenon to memory institutions. Guided by the multi method design and underpinned by the triangulation of questionnaires, interviews, observation and document analysis, the study examined digital preservation of e-government in Ghana. Findings revealed that the creation of databases, digital publication, emails, website information and tweets were often ocassioned by the use of ICT, e-government, and application of legislations and public policies. It observed that these types of digital records were in urgent need for preservation as most of the ministries and agencies were unable to access their digital records. While the application of a digital preservation tool (Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe) was a familiar terrain to the ministries and agencies, there was expressed lack of awareness about digital preservation support organisations and digital preservation standards. The study identified funding, level of security and privacy, skills training and technological obsolescence as factors that pose key threats to digital preservation. It noted backup strategy, migration, metadata and trusted repositories as the most widely implemented preservation strategy across the ministries and agencies. On the other hand, cloud computing, refreshing and emulation were the least implemented preservation strategies used to address the digital preservation challenges. The study recommends that the ministries and agencies can address many of the digital preservation challenges if they leverage on collaborative and participatory opportunities. Such collaborative and participatory opportunities involve the use of experts from other institutions to share resources and use a common protocol through cloud computing and Open Data. It further recommends that the process of developing a digital preservation policy can be guided by a template document from other jurisdictionsInformation ScienceD. Litt et Phil.

40|$|Some theorists {{argue that}} a {{justification}} of criminal punishment presupposes a theory of state power. Although the state is typically assigned the task of inflicting criminal sanctions, {{the mere fact that}} the criminal deserves to be punished cannot in itself justify the infliction of punishment by the state, as non-state agents could presumably give people their just deserts. One way of addressing the plea for a theory of state power would be to suggest that state-inflicted sanctions are justified simply {{on the grounds that the}} state is more likely than other agents to determine accurately what a wrongdoer justly deserves and to inflict a just sanction on those who deserve it. Hence, the state 2 ̆ 7 s role in inflicting criminal sanctions is contingent and, in principle, the state could be replaced by other agents, e. g., private individuals. This hypothesis has given rise to recent calls to reform the state 2 ̆ 7 s criminal justice system by introducing privately-inflicted sanctions, e. g., shaming penalties, private prisons or private probationary services. This paper challenges this view and argues that the agency of the state is indispensable to criminal sanctions in a way that renders the idea of replacing state-inflicted sanctions with privately inflicted sanctions not merely contingently undesirable. Privately-inflicted sanctions sever the link between state 2 ̆ 7 s judgments concerning the wrongfulness of the action and the appropriateness of the sanction and the infliction of sufferings on the criminal. When a private individual inflicts punishment she acts on what she and not the state judges to be a sufficient basis for action. Privately-inflicted sanctions for violations of criminal laws are not grounded in the judgments of the appropriate agent, namely the state. It is impermissible on the part of the state to approve a sanction inflicted on an alleged wrongdoer on the basis of <b>such</b> <b>a</b> private judgment. <b>Such</b> <b>an</b> <b>approval</b> grants undue weight to the private judgment of the individual who inflicts the sanction...|$|R

40|$|Before 1989, in {{hospitals}} across Canada, groups of 3 physicians would meet {{once a week}} to read and con-sider stories of failure and remorse.

In 1988 the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the existing abortion law (section 287 of the Criminal Code) as unconstitutional. A woman who wishes to terminate a pregnancy is no longer required to obtain a committee’s opinion that continuing the pregnancy would endanger her health or life.

40|$|In 2007, the ALK {{tyrosine}} kinase {{was described as}} a potential therapeutic target for a subset of non-small-cell lung cancer patients.

This remarkable example of the coming of age of personalized medicine in cancer therapy is hopefully only an auspice of things to come in a rapidly developing field.

Similarly to medicine <b>approval</b> systems, <b>such</b> <b>a</b> new <b>approval</b> process could be based on four consequential phases evaluating the effect of the following: single components (phase 1); combinations of components (phase 2); the final intervention—comprising only components found effective in the previous phases—via large, multicentre, randomized trials whenever possible (phase 3); and the long-term effects as well as the effects in different contexts (phase 4). Once phase 3 shows convincing results, the intervention would be approved for delivery to its target population.
