5|$|When {{the scale}} of the {{divergence}} between the IPK and national kilogram prototypes was reported in 2005, a debate arose on how best to redefine the kilogram – should the kilogram be defined in terms of the mass of the silicon-28 atom or <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> determined using the watt balance? The mass of a silicon atom could be determined using the Avogadro project and using Avogadro's number be linked directly to the kilogram.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} was {{made between the}} ministry, the tunnel company and the county municipality on 6 January 1994 to build the tunnel.

The construction would be the responsibility of Hordaland Public Roads Administration, with the tunnel company only responsible for their part of the financing and the collection of tolls.

5|$|However, {{by then it}} {{had become}} clear that Frogner west of Solli plass would remain dominantly a {{residential}} area. The estimates showed that the station would capture few new riders and instead simply give a shorter walk for {{a small minority of}} those who used Nationaltheatret Station and Skøyen Station. With the upgraded Nationaltheatret Station, which opened in 1999, the capacity of the Oslo Tunnel increased from 16 to 24 trains per hour in each direction, because the station from then had four, rather than two, tracks. A similar upgrade would need to be done for Elisenberg Station, <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> taken into use, or the capacity of the tunnel would again be reduced. It is therefore highly unlikely that the station will ever be opened. In 1998, the readers of the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten proposed making Elisenberg an emergency exit.|$|E

Kennedy subsequently sought Shoup's advice in evaluating the implications of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. While his position in the Joint Chiefs of Staff was intended to be limited, he had gained Kennedy's confidence and was often called on for private consultations. Shoup supported the test ban, seeing it as a deterrent to nuclear war.|$|E
5|$|The Picardy Spaniel is a docile {{breed of}} dog and {{is fond of}} playing with {{children}} and bonds well with their master. It is described as having a gentle sociable nature, possessing a good character and being relatively easy to train. In France, the breed is used for hunting in wooded areas for Pheasants, and in swamps for Snipes. However {{it can also be}} used for hunting ducks, hares and rabbits. The breed excels at hunting in marshes and will not hesitate to jump into water. It can also adequately serve as a retriever <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> required.

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then why <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May, Baroness Symons, {{a junior}} {{minister}} in the MoD, told the House of Lords that British forces would remain in Sierra Leone, mainly to ensure the security of Lungi airport while UNAMSIL brought in reinforcements. Soldiers also remained at the evacuation point in Freetown to ensure its security, while others patrolled the streets of Freetown {{in an attempt to}} reassure residents. HMS Illustrious, with her air group, and the ARG both arrived on 14 May, bringing the number of British personnel in the operational area to approximately 4,500. Harriers from Illustrious began flying reassurance patrols over Freetown and the ARG supplemented British firepower, particularly at Lungi, with the provision of artillery. In the field, the British forces divided their efforts between three lines of operation: support to UNAMSIL, support to the SLA, and preparation to provide humanitarian assistance, <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> necessary, though the expanded mandate only became formal government policy several days later. During the following week, the RUF began to remobilise in the north of the country. The UN and the Sierra Leonean government feared that UNAMSIL troops between the RUF and Freetown {{might not be able to}} stand up to an assault by the RUF, and so the RAF Chinooks—in the country to conduct the evacuation—were used to ferry reinforcements from Lungi as they arrived. Meanwhile, President Ahmad Kabbah formed an alliance of militia groups (including the self-styled Civil Defence Force and the West Side Boys) and the remnants of the SLA, totalling around 6,000 personnel, to assist UNAMSIL forces in blocking the RUF advance. The British also provided reconnaissance for UNAMSIL using ground-based signals and intelligence personnel and special forces as well as flights by Harriers and a Nimrod R1.|$|E

5|$|Phoenix's {{investigation}} {{brings him}} to look into an incident seven years ago, in which Athena's mother Metis was killed and Blackquill was convicted for the murder. With one day until Blackquill's planned execution, his sister Aura takes several people hostage, including Phoenix's adopted daughter Trucy, demanding that a re-trial of the case is held to convict Athena for Metis's murder. Upon receiving a letter from Maya Fey, Phoenix decides to hold the trial in the courtroom destroyed in the earlier bombing. Together with chief prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, Phoenix deduces that a third party {{was responsible for the}} murder, proving Athena's and Blackquill's innocence. Edgeworth declares Blackquill a free man, and places him back in charge as prosecutor for the case while he retrieves vital information. Phoenix learns that the true culprit behind both Metis's and Clay's murders was the Phantom, an international spy that has disguised himself as the deceased Fulbright. The Phantom posed as Fulbright to steal evidence to conceal his true identity, fearing he will be killed by his enemies <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> revealed. With the assistance of Edgeworth, Blackquill, Apollo and Athena, Phoenix manages to break the normally emotionless Phantom, after which the Phantom is shot by an unseen sniper. After proving the Phantom's guilt and Athena's innocence and bringing an end to the dark age, the Wright Anything Agency sees Solomon off as he heads into space.|$|E
