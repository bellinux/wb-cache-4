40|$|Objective: The study {{focuses on}} the <b>self</b> - <b>esteem</b> of deaf and hard of hearing (D/HH) and hearing {{adolescents}} (HA) in Slovenia. The {{aim of this study}} is a comparison of <b>self</b> - <b>esteem</b> between D/HH and HA regarding the hearing status, age, gender, and the com parison among D/HH adolescents regarding communication and education settings. It is hypothesized that deaf and hard of hearing adolescents hav e lower <b>self</b> - <b>esteem</b> than their hearing peers. Methods: The final sample included 130 adolescents who were split into two groups with the method of equal pairs: 65 D/HH adolescents and 6 5 HA, which were esta blis hed on the basis of gender, age, nationality, and educational programme of schooling. The phenomenon of <b>self</b> - <b>esteem</b> was measured with the Rosenberg <b>Self</b> - <b>Esteem</b> Scale, which was translated and adapted into the Slovenian Sign Langu age (SSL). Results: The results show significant differ ren - ces in <b>self</b> - <b>esteem</b> between D/HH and HA adolescents. D/HH adolescents have, on average, lower <b>self</b> - <b>esteem</b> than HA. There are differences in <b>self</b> - <b>esteem</b> regarding gender and also regarding ages of 16 and of 20. D/HH adolescents who use speech or sign language in their communication have higher <b>self</b> - <b>esteem</b> than those who use mostly sign language. D/HH adolescents in mainstream schools have hig her <b>self</b> - <b>esteem</b> than those included into a segregated form of schooling.

25|$|The {{capacities}} and demands {{model has been}} proposed {{to account for the}} heterogeneity of the disorder. In this approach, speech performance varies depending on the capacity that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the demands placed upon the person by the speaking situation. Capacity for fluent speech may be affected by a predisposition to the disorder, auditory processing or motor speech deficits, and cognitive or affective issues. Demands may be increased by internal factors such as lack of confidence or <b>self</b> <b>esteem</b> or inadequate language skills or external factors such as peer pressure, time pressure, stressful speaking situations, insistence on perfect speech, and the like. In stuttering, the severity of the disorder is seen as likely to increase when demands placed on the person's speech and language system exceed their capacity to deal with these pressures. However, the precise nature of the capacity or incapacity has not been delineated.|$|E

Although, {{it is suggested that}} many factors influence an individual’s levels of subjective performance which include <b>self</b> – <b>esteem</b> (SE), age, gender and country of residence. Method: There were 119 participants in this study (68 males and 53 females) with age ranging from 18 – 41 years. 82 participants were located in Ireland and the rest were from other countries. SE was measured with the Rosenberg <b>Self</b> – <b>Esteem</b> Scale (RSES) and SSP was measured using the Physical Activity and Sports Anxiety scale (PASAS). Results: It was found that there was a moderate, positive correlation between SSP and SE with higher scores of SE correlating with higher levels of SSP. Additionally, female Gaelic players had higher levels of SE than men, which is on the contrary of relevant research. There {{was no significant difference in}} age groups and levels of SSP. Additionally, there was no significant relationship with SSP and country of residence. Discussion: The results from this study are profound as they highlight what affects an individual’s levels of subjective sport performance and what does not. As this study is the first of its kind, that presents with new and under researched areas of sport psychology, makes this study influential...|$|R
40|$|The {{onset of}} a chronic disease {{influences}} other roles or identities. For example, an HIV or AIDS diagnosis can affect a person’s work identity (Bedell, 1997). In this article, we explored how living with HIV/AIDS shapes other identities. Thirty - six individuals living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs) participated in semi - structured interviews.

In general, respondents’ advocate and recovering addict identities emerged and gained salience after being diagnosed with HIV or AIDS.
