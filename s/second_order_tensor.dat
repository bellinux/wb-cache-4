25|$|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) {{equations}} are {{the oldest}} approach to turbulence modeling. An ensemble {{version of the}} governing equations is solved, which introduces new apparent stresses known as Reynolds stresses. This adds a <b>second</b> <b>order</b> <b>tensor</b> of unknowns for which various models can provide different levels of closure. It is a common misconception that the RANS equations {{do not apply to}} flows with a time-varying mean flow because these equations are 'time-averaged'. In fact, statistically unsteady (or non-stationary) flows can equally be treated. This is sometimes referred to as URANS. There is nothing inherent in Reynolds averaging to preclude this, but the turbulence models used to close the equations are valid only as long as the time over which these changes in the mean occur is large compared to the time scales of the turbulent motion containing most of the energy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{notation}} for vectors (first <b>order</b> <b>tensors)</b> and <b>tensors</b> (<b>second</b> <b>order</b> <b>tensors)</b> {{in physical}} three-dimensional space is proposed that satisfies {{a number of}} requirements which are missing in the customary vector, matrix and tensor notations. It is designed particularly to distinguish between vectors and tensors and their representation as vectors and matrices in different coordinate systems. This is achieved {{by the introduction of}} the base as a tensor quantity in the fundamental equation for the relation between a tensor and its representation as a matrix. The main purpose of the new notation is that it can be used in the teaching situation, therefore, it conveys all the information explicitly in the symbols, and it can be used in handwriting. All different numerical quantities have different symbols so that in numerical and symbolic computer applications the symbols can be copied directly to similar computer names which provides for well chosen names of variables in a computer program. It is also shown that the same notation is equally useful for vectors in abstract higher dimensional space and transformations and transforms in function space. Part I discusses the notation for orthogonal coordinates, including Cartesian coordinates for which the notation is very simple. Part II discusses how the same notation is equally efficient for skew and curved coordinates, and how it is integrated with tensor notation for higher than <b>second</b> <b>order</b> <b>tensors...</b>|$|R
