50|$|The area's led central {{location}} and its presence therein {{of much of}} Argentina's governmental structure led to monumental construction over the next twenty years, notable among which are the Buenos Aires City Legislature, the Customs building, the offices of La Prensa (today the Buenos Aires House of Culture), the art-deco NH City Hotel (off the Plaza de Mayo), the Ministry of Defense and South Diagonal Avenue. Monserrat's western half was partitioned from the rest by the southward expansion of the massive Nueve de Julio Avenue around 1950 and, partial to trendy high-rises, much of Monserrat's middle class and commercial office <b>space</b> <b>market</b> left, afterwards. The area became a largely bohemian quarter popular with tango performers and artists, {{as well as many}} who preferred the area's close proximity to the growing financial district to the north and its relatively low rent scale. Its rich architectural history and quaint, narrow streets have, as in neighboring San Telmo, helped lead to renewed interest in Monserrat since around 1990, a change highlighted by the 1993 opening of the high-rise InterContinental Hotel. The area's numerous Spanish restaurants and social clubs belonging to Buenos Aires' large Spaniard community have long associated Monserrat with local Spanish tradition, helping make it attractive to tourism for cultural reasons, {{as well as those of}} ambiance.|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} the 18 th Annual AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellites {{questions}} whether small satellites are a complimentary or a disruptive technology. This paper addresses this question by performing {{an analysis of the}} role small satellites play in the <b>space</b> <b>market.</b> The market is segmented into three primary components, military space, civil space, and commercial space. Analysis focuses on the U.

Interestingly, an ORBCOMM case study suggests that high launch costs are not a major obstacle to growth in the commercial <b>space</b> <b>market</b> since they represent just 10 % of the total investment required. Overall, the study finds that small satellites are unlikely to be able to perform the roles played by large satellites, so any transition of small satellites from a complimentary to a disruptive technology must come through new applications that open up new markets...|$|E
