40|$|The mitotic cyclins promote cell {{division}} by binding and activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Each cyclin {{has a unique}} pattern of subcellular localization that plays {{a vital role in}} regulating {{cell division}}. During mitosis, cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> is known <b>to</b> localize to centrosomes, microtubules, and chromatin. To determine the mechanisms of cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> localization in M phase, we imaged full-length and mutant versions of human cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> -enhanced green fluorescent protein in live cells by using spinning disk confocal microscopy. In addition to centrosome, microtubule, and chromatin localization, we found that cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> also localizes <b>to</b> unattached kinetochores after nuclear envelope breakdown. Kinetochore recruitment of cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> required the kinetochore proteins Hec 1 and Mad 2, and it was stimulated by microtubule destabilization.

In contrast, localization of cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> <b>to</b> chromatin and centrosomes is independent of CDK 1 binding.

Moderate doping (NB 2 ̆ 23 c 1017 cm 2 ̆ 2123) yielded PL features comprised of both sharp and broad peaks in the boron bound exciton (B-BE) region.

Increasing the PL sample temperature above 4. 2 K caused a rapid decay of the broad B-BE peak intensity, thus permitting comparison of <b>B</b> <b>1</b> <b>TO</b> intensity for a range of ion energies and growth temperatures.

Previous studies showed that the cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> subunit localizes <b>to</b> several compartments of a mitotic cell, including the centrosomes, mitotic spindle, kinetochores and chromosomes via distinct sequence elements. Mitotic chromosome association occurs through the unstructured N-terminal domain of cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and is independent of CDK 1 binding. Here, we use live cell imaging of human cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> fused <b>to</b> GFP to precisely define the sequence elements within cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> that mediate its association with condensed mitotic chromosomes. We find that a short, evolutionarily conserved N-terminal motif is required for cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> <b>to</b> localize to mitotic chromosomes. We further reveal a role for arginine residues within and near the destruction box sequence in the chromosome association of cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1.</b> Additionally, our data suggest that sequences further downstream in cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1,</b> such as the cytoplasmic retention sequence and the cyclin box, may negatively modulate chromosome association.

Two populations were constituted: {{one with a}} high risk of causing meningitis (HR group; 63 strains), and the other with a lower risk of causing meningitis (LR group; 46 strains). Strains belonging to the HR group were significantly less able to use four carbon sources, i. e., α-d-glucose- 1 -phosphate, d-ribose, β-methyl-d-glucoside, and d,l-α-glycerol phosphate, than strains from the LR group (P ≤ 0. 004). Moreover, strains in the HR group significantly more frequently possessed one of several mobile genetic elements or genome deletions previously shown to be associated with strains responsible for neonatal meningitis than strains in the LR group (P < 0. 001). These findings suggest that genetic disruption might have occurred in virulent clones of S. agalactiae. Fifteen biotypes (<b>B</b> <b>1</b> <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 15) were identified from the results of oxidation of the four carbon sources, of which six (<b>B</b> <b>1</b> <b>to</b> <b>B</b> 6) included 92 % of the isolates belonging to the HR group.

40|$|Abstract Progression through G 2 {{phase of}} the cell cycle is a {{technically}} difficult area of cell biology to study {{due to the lack}} of physical markers specific to this phase. The FUCCI system uses the biology of the cell cycle to drive fluorescence in select phases of the cell cycle. Similarly, a commercially available system has used a fluorescent analog of the Cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> protein <b>to</b> visualize cells from late S phase to the metaphase– anaphase transition. We have modified these systems to use the promoter and destruction box elements of Cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> <b>to</b> drive a cyan fluorescent protein. We demonstrate here that this is a useful tool for measuring the length of G 2 phase without perturbing any aspect of cell cycle progression...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHip 2, a {{ubiquitin}} conjugating enzyme, {{is involved}} in the suppression of cell death. The present study revealed that Hip 2 regulates the stability of the apoptotic and cell cycle regulator cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1.</b> Hip 2 was found to interact with cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> <b>to</b> promote its degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. As a result, Hip 2 significantly blocked cell death induced by the cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> protein, suggesting that Hip 2 {{is involved in}} the regulation of cyclin <b>B</b> <b>1</b> -mediated cell death.

Such devices {{are capable of}} discriminating the different compositions of gas mixtures emitted by stools, for colorectal cancer screening (A 1), and by blood, for tumors monitoring (<b>B</b> <b>1),</b> according <b>to</b> defined sampling protocols. Results have been acquired by a LabView® software and statistically treated (e. g. quadratic discriminant analysis, QDA) and show to be encouraging with an error of 5 % for SCENT A 1. Preliminary results of SCENT <b>B</b> <b>1</b> proved <b>to</b> be promising. Further studies {{will be carried out}} for clinically validating the two devices...|$|R

40|$|SummaryN 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} internal modification of messenger RNA. While the presence of m 6 A on transcripts can impact nuclear RNA fates, a reader of this mark that mediates processing of nuclear transcripts has not been identified. We find that the RNA-binding protein HNRNPA 2 <b>B</b> <b>1</b> binds m 6 A-bearing RNAs in vivo and in vitro and its biochemical footprint matches the m 6 A consensus motif. HNRNPA 2 <b>B</b> <b>1</b> directly binds a set of nuclear transcripts and elicits similar alternative splicing effects as the m 6 A writer METTL 3. Moreover, HNRNPA 2 <b>B</b> <b>1</b> binds <b>to</b> m 6 A marks in a subset of primary miRNA transcripts, interacts with the microRNA Microprocessor complex protein DGCR 8, and promotes primary miRNA processing. Also, HNRNPA 2 <b>B</b> <b>1</b> loss and METTL 3 depletion cause similar processing defects for these pri-miRNA precursors. We propose HNRNPA 2 <b>B</b> <b>1</b> <b>to</b> be a nuclear reader of the m 6 A mark and to mediate, in part, this mark’s effects on primary microRNA processing and alternative splicing.
