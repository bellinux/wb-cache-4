5|$|The Pipe rolls are {{the records}} of the audits of the sheriffs' accounts, usually {{conducted}} at Michaelmas by the Exchequer, or English treasury. Until the chancery records began in the reign of King John of England, they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government. They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer. They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records of the audit of the accounts rendered. Although the rolls use an accounting system, it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance {{until the end of the}} 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each shire. In their early form, they record all debts owed to the Crown, whether from feudal dues or from other sources. Because many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in installments, it is necessary to search more than one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> for a complete history of a debt. If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record the full amount of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed. Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates.|$|E

50|$|Torque {{density is}} useful during the concept {{evaluation}} stage of mechanical designs, especially in power train design problems. Typically, {{it will be}} one of many factors used to assign potential success measures to each concept.

There may be several types of devices that can perform the function of an existing component that must be replaced.

50|$|Roll forming is, {{among the}} {{manufacturing}} processes, {{one of the}} simplest. It typically begins with a large coil of sheet metal, between 1 inch cm and 20 inch cm. in width, and 0.004 inch mm and 0.125 inch mm thick, supported on an uncoiler. The strip is fed through an entry guide to properly align the material as it passes through the rolls of the mill, each <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> forming a bend until the material reaches its desired shape. Roll sets are typically mounted {{one over the other}} on a pair of horizontal parallel shafts supported by a stand(s). Side rolls and cluster rolls may also be used to provide greater precision and flexibility and to limit stresses on the material. The shaped strips can be cut to length ahead of a roll forming mill, between mills, or {{at the end of the}} roll forming line.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a high demand for weight {{reduction}} in automotive vehicles while maintaining passenger safety. A potential steel material to achieve this is Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS). As a high strength material, {{it is difficult to}} be formed with desired profiles using traditional sheet metal forming processes such as Cold Roll Forming. To overcome this problem, a potentially alternative solution is Chain-die Forming (CDF), recently developed. The basic principal of the CDF is to fully combine roll forming and bending processes. The main advantage of this process is the elongated deformation length that significantly increases effective roll radius. This study focuses on identifying issues with the CDF by using CAD modelling, Motion Analysis and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to devise solutions and construct a more reliable process in an optimal design sense. Some attempts on finite element modelling and simulation of the CDF were conducted using relatively simple models in literature and the research was still not sufficient enough for optimal design of a typical CDF for UHSS. Therefore two numerical models of Chain-die Forming process are developed in this study, including a) one having a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> similar to roll forming but with a large radius, i. e., 20 meters; and b) the other one with dies and punch segments similar to a typical CDF machine. As a case study, to form a 60 Â° channel with single pass was conducted using these two devised models for a comparison. The obtained numerical results clearly show the CDF could generate less residual stress, low strain and small springback of a single pass for the 60 Â° UHSS channel. The design analysis procedure proposed in this study could greatly help the mechanical designers to devise a cost-effective and reliable CDF process for forming UHSS...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, a simple model {{was developed to}} extend {{the application of the}} traditional flower pattern diagram as a design tool for roll forming. The position of a point on the strip as it passes through each <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> can be identified as a series of points in the two-dimensional flower pattern diagram. In three dimensions, these points will lie on a non-circular cylindrical surface having its axis parallel to the machine axis. Assuming that these points are joined by a smooth curve, the forming path of a point on the strip as it passes through the roll forming process can be obtained as a plane curve on the plane development of this surface. It was shown in previous work that the longitudinal membrane strain and, in certain cases, local curvature of the sheet are functions of the slope of this plane curve. In this work, the strains on both surfaces {{at the edge of a}} strip in the forming of a simple V-channel are measured using strain gauges. It is shown that near the point of contact with the rolls, the strains differ by nearly an order of magnitude from those determined from the simple model which assumes that the trajectory is a smooth curve. A modification of the forming path is obtained from the measured bending strains. Although the changes in displacement are small, the peak values of strain near the point of roll contact are large and a consequence of highly localised changes in the forming path as the strip passes over each roll. Measurement of this perturbation in the forming path is difficult as the region is obscured by the forming rolls. The technique described here permits the reconstruction of this path and identifies a new area of investigation of longitudinal strains in roll forming. These are often associated with shape defects such as bow, warping and end flare...|$|E

At early times in the simulations, we observe a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolled</b> up vortices that advance at varying speeds. These Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) vortex tubes are generated at the surface and exhibit a counter-clockwise rotation. In addition to the K-H vortices, another <b>set</b> <b>of</b> clockwise rotating vortex tubes initiate at the bottom surface and {{play a major role in}} the near wall dynamics. These vortex structures have a strong influence on wall shear-stress and deposition pattern. Their relations are explored as wel...|$|R
40|$|In February 2011, the {{dramatic}} ouster of Hosni Mubarak threw {{into the spotlight}} the U. S. policy of granting generous and unconditional aid to the Egyptian regime {{at a time when}} the strategic rationale for such aid had become less obvious and calls for inserting human rights considerations into foreign aid allocations more prominent. Focusing on an unprecedented <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> call votes taken in the U. S. House of Representatives during the years 2004 to 2007, this article offers the first quantitative assessment of the determinants of Congressional support for U. S. economic and military aid for Egypt. It challenges conventional wisdom on the limited role of campaign contributions in Congressional decision making by highlighting the central role of defense lobby contributions in maintaining the Congressional coalition that shielded Egypt's prerevolutionary regime from increased U. S. pressure in the years leading up to its eventual demise...|$|R
