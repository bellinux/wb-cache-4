We use an Ultra High Frequency (UHF) RFID system that is composed of a standard RFID reader, a large set of standard passive tags whose locations are known, and a newly designed, special <b>semi-passive</b> <b>tag</b> attached to an object that is tracked. This <b>semi-passive</b> <b>tag</b> has the dual ability to sense the backscatter communication between the reader and other passive tags which are in its proximity and to communicate this sensed information to the reader using backscatter modulation. We refer to this tag as a sense-a-tag (ST). Thus, the ST can provide the reader with {{information that can be}} used to determine the kinematic parameters of the object on which the ST is attached.

30|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) {{is known}} in the commercial sectors. Passive or <b>semi-passive</b> <b>tag</b> devices are used in RFID to modulate the radiated RF carrier signals in the wave propagation channel, in which the reader can demodulate the tag’s specific data [1]. The wireless communication approach avoids using an active transmitter in the tag device for power and space savings. By including a sensory data source in the tag device, real-time sensing and data transmission become feasible for applications in the wireless sensor network (WSN) [2 – 4]. An innovative implementation is for data-intensive applications such as video streaming using the semi-passive devices. The importance is that the power associated with the transmitter task can be eliminated from the tag device. This permits cost, space, and power saving for semi-passive devices for guaranteed longevity with the available power resources. It is also possible to use the ambient signals from radio stations for the backscatter communications; the ambient signals are used to illuminate the tag device instead of the reader’s transmitter [5 – 7]. Considering high data rate communication for data-intensive applications, we target hardening the communication channel with a <b>semi-passive</b> <b>tag</b> device in the multipath fading channels.|$|E

30|$|The {{augmented}} RFID receiver offers {{good performance}} and low cost {{due to the}} use of an industry UHF RFID reader IC and novel way of synchronizing with the reader. Quantitatively, the receiver achieved a read rate of 50 % for a passive tag and 66 % for a <b>semi-passive</b> <b>tag</b> that are placed 1 m away. With the maximum range, between the ARR and the tag with the reader located within 8 m of the ARR, the receiver can decode EPCs properly at 3.25 m for passive and 5.5 m for semi-passive tags.|$|E
30|$|The {{first set}} of {{experiments}} on the ARR was performed to characterize its performance based on {{the distance from the}} reader.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} case study which attempts to implement a passive Ultra High Frequency Radio Frequency Identification (UHF RFID) system on aircraft landing gear (LG) to permit component configuration management. It is shown that a monostatic RFID system with two reader antennas, one on the LG main fitting {{and one in the}} wing bay allows up to 64 kbits of data to be associated with each LG component. A 7 dB system margin allows data on each LG component to be updated wirelessly and will also enable a passive UHF RFID-based LG health and usage monitoring system when tags with required sensors become available. Results from an electromagnetic simulation show that when a metal is illuminated by a nearby antenna the E-field distribution close to its surface is stronger than in free space. To explore if the stronger E-field can be used to enhance the performance of a conventional passive tag, a 5 cm × 6 mm × 3. 02 m aluminium bar has been selected as the tagging object and connected to the reader via an RF feed. It is shown that a conventional metal tag which has a maximum free space range of 1. 3 m when mounted on a metal plate can be detected up to 30 m along the aluminium bar from the RF feed. When orientated with the long axis normal to the metal surface a conventional passive tag with a dipole antenna can efficiently harvest the E- field and can be read at least 50 m away from the antenna feed. The proposed use of metal objects as a nearfield antenna is well suited to some applications, but in others a significant wireless path is still required. In such a case, a <b>semi-passive</b> <b>tag</b> can be used. It is demonstrated that a <b>semi-passive</b> <b>tag</b> only requires 14. 4 to be read over 42 m in a bistatic RFID system. Such a power consumption can be easily achieved by most energy harvesting techniques. It is demonstrated that a solar-powered <b>semi-passive</b> <b>tag</b> can be read at a range of 22 m, but its performance is still limited by multipath effects. A distributed antenna system (DAS) can be used to overcome these effects by using frequency and phase hopping techniques. It is demonstrated that 50 solar-powered semi-passive tags can be read with no missed detections over a 10 m × 20 m office area with 4 dB system margin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a backscatter communication (BackCom) system including a reader and N tags, where each tag receives excitation signals transmitted by {{the reader and}} concurrently backscatters information to the reader in time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) mode. In this system, we aim to maximize the total system goodput by jointly optimizing reader transmission power, time allocation, and reflection ratio for the cases of passive and <b>semi-passive</b> <b>tags.</b> For each case, an optimization problem is formulated, which is non-convex and can be solved by being decomposed into at most N feasible sub-problems based on the priority of allocated reader transmission power.

30|$|When tag cost, size, {{and power}} {{consumption}} requirements become particularly stringent, passive or <b>semi-passive</b> <b>tag</b> solutions {{have to be}} taken into consideration. Communication with passive tags usually relies on backscatter modulation where the antenna reflection properties are changed according to information data, even though the tag's control logic and memory circuits have still to be energized to have the tag working properly [2]. Typically, passive RFID tags obtain the necessary power to operate from the RF signal sent by the reader. As a consequence, in conventional UHF RFID systems the corresponding operating range is usually no more than 7 - 8 m with a transmission power level of 2 - 4 W [19]. Unfortunately, owing to regulatory constraints, the transmission power allowed for UWB devices is below 0 dBm [20]. This means that sufficient power cannot be derived from the received UWB signal to power up a remote tag at a significant distance. Besides the adoption of semi-passive tags, where the control logic is battery powered, a promising possibility for retrieving the necessary energy is to adopt energy scavenging techniques which, in many cases, provide sufficient power (about 1 μ W) for the control logic [21].|$|E

30|$|Recently, {{augmented}} {{ultrahigh frequency}} radio-frequency identification (UHF RFID) {{systems have been}} developed, and they contain additional components that can detect a tag’s backscattered response and use this information for the localization of the tag and other applications. The methods currently employed either have poor performance because the detection of the tag’s response is based on envelope detection or are costly because {{they are based on}} software-defined radio. The solution proposed in the paper is to use a method called synchronous detection to intercept tag signals. Using synchronous detection, we were able to use a conventional UHF RFID reader integrated circuit for the method, leading to a cost-effective, high-performance solution. We performed an analysis of its read rate and read range performance. The analysis showed that our receiver is capable of receiving tag signals with a read rate of 50 % for passive and 66 % for <b>semi-passive</b> <b>tags</b> at a 1 -m distance between the tag and the receiver and is capable of receiving tag signals at a maximum distance between the tag and the receiver of 3.25 m for passive and 5.5 m for <b>semi-passive</b> <b>tags,</b> with the reader being within 8 m of the receiver.

These limitations are: lack of a well defined read zone, interference, and environment sensitivity. To overcome these limitations a novel receiver device is introduced into the system. The use of such device or devices mitigates the issues by enabling more "anchor points" in the system. Two such devices exist in industry and academia: the Astraion Sensatag and the Gen 2 Listener. The drawbacks of the Sensatag is that it offers poor performance in capturing tag signals. The Gen 2 Listener is based on the expensive software defined radio hardware. The purpose of the thesis was to develop a receiver that will enable several new RFID applications that are not available with current RFID systems. The receiver, named ARR (Augmented RFID Receiver), receives tag and reader signals, which are decoded by an FPGA and the results are reported through Ethernet.

Problems of signals demodulation, parameters estimation and localization are addressed exploiting analytical methods, simulations and experimentation, for the derivation of the fundamental limits, the performance characterization of the proposed schemes and the experimental validation. Ultrawide-bandwidth (UWB) signals are in certain cases considered and non-coherent receivers, allowing the exploitation of the multipath channel diversity without adopting complex architectures, investigated. Closed-form expressions for the achievable bit error probability of novel proposed architectures are derived. The problem of time delay estimation (TDE), enabling network localization thanks to ranging measurement, is addressed from a theoretical point of view. New fundamental bounds on TDE are derived in the case the received signal is partially known or unknown at receiver side, as often occurs due to propagation or due to the adoption of low-complexity estimators. Practical estimators, such as energy-based estimators, are revised and their performance compared with the new bounds. The localization issue is addressed with experimentation for the characterization of cooperative networks. Practical algorithms able to improve the accuracy in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel conditions are evaluated on measured data. With the purpose of enhancing the localization coverage in NLOS conditions, non-regenerative relaying techniques for localization are introduced and ad hoc position estimators are devised.

40|$|Abstract—Passive and semi-passive UHF RFID {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} been designed using scalar-valued differential radar cross section (DRCS) methods to model the backscattered signal from the tag. This paper argues that scalar-valued DRCS analysis is unnecessarily limiting because of the inherent coherence of the backscatter link and the complex-valued nature of load-dependent antenna-mode scattering from an RFID tag. Consider-ing modulated backscatter in terms of complex-valued scattered fields opens the possibility of quadrature modulation of the backscatter channel. When compared with binary ASK or PSK based RFID systems which transmit one bit of data per symbol period, and thus one bit per on-chip clock oscillator period, tags employing vector backscatter modulation can transmit more than one bit per symbol period. This increases the data rate for a given on-chip symbol clock rate leading to reduced on-chip power consumption and extended read range. Alternatively, tags employing an M-ary modulator can achieve log 2 M higher data throughput at essentially the same DC power consumption as a tag employing binary ASK or PSK. In contrast to the binary ASK or PSK backscatter modulation employed by passive and <b>semi-passive</b> UHF RFID <b>tags,</b> such as tags compliant with the widely used ISO 18000 - 6 c standard, this paper explores a novel CMOS-compatible method for generating M-ary QAM backscatter modulation. A new method is presented for designing an inductorlessM-ary QAM backscatter modulator using only an array of switched resistances and capacitances. Device-level simulation and measurements of a 4 -PSK/ 4 -QAM modulator are provided for a <b>semi-passive</b> (battery-assisted) <b>tag</b> operating in the 850 - 950 MHz band. This first prototype modulator transmits 4 -PSK/ 4 -QAM at a symbol rate of 200 kHz and a bit rate of 400 kbps at a static power dissipation of only 115 nW.

30|$|An RFID tag {{consists}} of an antenna that is connected to an electronic circuit, which in most cases is built on an integrated circuit. Many RFID systems use the so-called passive or <b>semi-passive</b> <b>tags</b> that do not use an internal power source {{to communicate with the}} RFID reader. They instead use backscattering, a technique which is {{based on the fact that}} the amplitude and phase of the waves scattered from an antenna depend on the antenna termination impedance. Thus, the tag sends data to the reader by modulating the impedance that the tag chip presents to the antenna terminals [2, 3]. While this backscattering technique, seen from the tag, enables remotely powered communication, it necessitates a constant carrier signal to be transmitted from the RFID reader during the tag to reader data transfer [4 – 6]. Therefore, the RFID reader has to transmit a carrier signal while it simultaneously receives a weak backscattered signal from the tag. To separate transmit an receive paths, readers either use separate transmit and receive antennas or use circulators or directional couplers. In analogy to radar systems, the first case is called bistatic, while the second one is called monostatic. Still, both system concepts struggle with low transmitter to receiver isolations [7]. This demands for receivers with very large dynamic ranges, which enhance costs, both on the analog front end as well as on the analog to digital converters. To reduce these demands, many authors [6, 8 – 17] as well as commercial monolithic RFID reader chip manufacturers [18, 19] propose or use active leakage cancellation techniques. These techniques, which originate in radar [20, 21], extract a part of the transmit signal, adjust it in amplitude and phase and inject it at the receiver. When the amplitude is adjusted to be equal and the phase to be opposite of the leakage signal, the deliberately added signal and the leakage signal cancel. While there exist many publications on hardware implementations of these leaking carrier cancellers (LCCs), few exist on adjustment algorithms to adapt them. However, adaption is critical [22, 23] because typical RFID scenarios like warehouses and conveyor belts change permanently and therefore cannot be adjusted statically.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – In {{the supply}} chain, a {{warehouse}} {{is a crucial}} component for linking all chain parties. It is necessary to track the real time resource location and status to support warehouse operations effectively. Therefore, RFID technology has been adopted to facilitate the collection and sharing of data in a warehouse environment. However, an essential decision should {{be made on the}} type of RFID tags the warehouse managers should adopt, because {{it is very important to}} implement RFID tags that work in warehouse environment. As a result, the warehouse resources will be easily tracked and accurately located which will improve the visibility of warehouse operations, enhance the productivity and reduce the operation costs of the warehouse. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the reading performance of all types of RFID tags in a warehouse environment in order to choose the most appropriate RFID tags which will enhance the operational efficiency of a warehouse. Reading performance of active and passive RFID tags have been evaluated before while, <b>semi-passive</b> RFID <b>tag,</b> which is battery-assisted with greater sensitivity than passive tags and cheaper than active tags, has not been examined yet in a warehouse environment. This research is in- progress research and it is aiming to perform tests for evaluating the reading performance of semi-passive RFID apparatus t...|$|R
30|$|A {{promising}} {{communication technology}} for WBANs is backscatter {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) in the ultra high frequency (UHF) range. Backscatter RFID relies on the radio communication between an RFID reader, acting as a control unit, and a multitude of passive or <b>semi-passive</b> RFID transponders (<b>tags),</b> acting as sensor nodes. The principle of communication for transmitting information from the tag to the reader relies on a modulated backscatter signal. All power for the transmission of the sensor data is drawn from the electromagnetic field radiated by the reader. Hence, their low-power consumption makes backscatter tags appropriate for WBANs that require small, light-weight, and low-maintenance sensor nodes. In addition, research efforts are ongoing to integrate sensing capabilities in backscatter tags without further enhancing their power consumption [3 – 5]. Such sensor tags can then be beneficially used to monitor the physiological parameters of a person (e.g., blood pressure, temperature, heartbeat, or body motion).|$|R
