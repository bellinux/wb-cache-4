Pathogens can induce autoimmunity by polyclonal activation of B or T cells, or increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II molecules. There are several ways in which a pathogen can cause an autoimmune response. A pathogen may contain a protein that acts as a mitogen to encourage cell division, thus causing more B or T cell clones to be produced.

Pathogens can also cause the release of cytokines resulting in the activation of B or T cells, or they can alter macrophage function.

[...] Molecular mimicry has been characterized as recently as the 1970s as another mechanism by which a pathogen can generate autoimmunity. Molecular mimicry is defined as similar structures shared by molecules from dissimilar genes or by their protein products. Either the linear amino acid sequence or the conformational fit of the immunodominant epitope may be shared between the pathogen and host. This is also known as [...] "cross-reactivity" [...] between self antigen of the host and immunodominant epitopes of the pathogen. An autoimmune response is then generated against the epitope.

40|$|Autoimmune {{diseases}} {{are driven by}} immune cells that recognize <b>self-tissues.</b> A major goal for treatment strategies for autoimmune diseases is to turn off or tolerize self-reactive immune cells such as CD 4 T cells that coordinate tissue damage in many autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune {{diseases are}} often diagnosed many years following their onset. The self-reactive CD 4 T cells that must be tolerized, therefore, are previously activated or memory CD 4 T cells. Little is known about whether tolerance can be induced in memory CD 4 T cells. This paper demonstrates that memory CD 4 T cells survive initial exposure to tolerance-inducing signals but that a second activation signal leads to cell death.

40|$|SummaryNatural killer (NK) cells provide innate {{defense against}} tumors and infections {{by virtue of}} potent {{capacities}} to immediately kill cellular targets and produce cytokines. These effector functions may potentially damage normal <b>self-tissues</b> unless they are kept in check by tolerance mechanisms that need clarification. Here, we discuss recent studies indicating that the NK cells acquire functional competence directly through engagement of their MHC-specific receptors by self-MHC. Ironically, these receptors were first identified in terms of recognizing target cell MHC class I molecules and inhibiting NK cells in effector responses. Other studies of NK cell tolerance are also discussed. Although these studies begin to clarify {{the means by which}} NK cell tolerance is achieved, much more investigation is needed because NK cell tolerance is relevant to clinical observations in patients with infections and cancer...|$|R
40|$|SummaryTransforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) are {{regulatory}} cytokines with pleiotropic {{roles in}} the immune system. The prominent function of TGF-β is to maintain T cell tolerance to self or innocuous environmental antigens via its direct effects on the differentiation and homeostasis of effector and regulatory T cells. A critical route for the regulation of T cells by TGF-β is via activation of a T cell-produced latent form of TGF-β 1 by dendritic cell-expressed avβ 8 integrin. IL- 10 operates primarily as a feedback inhibitor of exuberant T cell responses to microbial antigens. T cells are also the principal producers of IL- 10, the expression of which is regulated by IL- 27, IL- 6, and TGF-β. The collective activity of TGF-β and IL- 10 ensures a controlled inflammatory response specifically targeting pathogens without evoking excessive immunopathology to <b>self-tissues...</b>|$|R

By transferring peripheral T cells from Ly 49 A transgenic mice into BALB/c nude/nude and B 6 nude/nude mice, we demonstrated that mature cells modulate their Ly 49 A receptor expression relative to the in vivo MHC class I environment.

40|$|The {{importance}} of T cell {{participation in the}} aetiology and pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is now widely appreciated. The disease is mediated by activated pro-inflammatory, self-reactive T helper cells, instigating the chronic autoimmune response characteristic of rheumatoid inflammation. Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a distinctive population of T cells thought to protect <b>self-tissues</b> from damaging inflammatory immune responses, and are often recognized as a regulatory T cell subtype, regulating the magnitude or class of the immune response. Recently, {{a number of studies}} have provided insight concerning the role of NKT cells in different models of autoimmune joint inflammation, suggesting the involvement of this specialized T cell subset in controlling initiation and perpetuation of arthritic disease. The aim of this review is to provide rheumatologists with an introduction of the principal features of NKT cells, to give an overview of the data obtained in animal models of arthritis and to discuss the hypothesized mechanisms.

40|$|It {{has been}} a long-held {{assumption}} that the innate immune system of insects causes self-harm when used to combat an immune insult. We show empirically that this assumption is correct. Invertebrate innate immunity relies heavily on effector systems which, on activation, produce cytotoxins that kill pathogens. Reliance on these robust, fast-acting, generic killing mechanisms ensures a potent and rapid response to pathogen invasion, but has the potential disadvantage of causing self-damage. We show that the innate immune response against an immune insult produces measurable phenotypic and functional damage to <b>self-tissue</b> in the beetle Tenebrio molitor.

Here, we established an autoimmune model of melanotic mass formation in Drosophila by genetically disrupting the basement membrane. We found that the basement membrane endows otherwise susceptible target tissues with self-tolerance that prevents autoimmunity, and further demonstrated that laminin is a key component for both structural maintenance and the self-tolerance checkpoint function of the basement membrane. Moreover, we found that cell integrity, as determined by cell-cell interaction and apicobasal polarity, functions as a second discrete checkpoint. Target tissues became vulnerable to blood cell encapsulation and subsequent melanization only after loss of both the basement membrane and cell integrity...|$|E

Moreover, paracetamol is metabolized into a toxic reactive metabolite that damage hepatocytes releasing danger signals, which triggers an innate immune response, leading to inflammation and collateral tissue damage to the liver and this may reduce leucocytes in the blood (Rainsford & Velo, 2012). NSAIDs may cause thymocyte developmental defects and bone marrow suppression monitoring by the decrease in production of cells responsible for providing immunity (leukocytes).

40|$|Autoimmune {{diseases}} {{are described as}} an immunological response against <b>self-tissue.</b> Major symptoms of autoimmune diseases include chronic or prolonged inflammation. One of the major mediators of inflammation is tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). TNF-α has also been implicated in autoimmune diseases. TNF-α {{has been called a}} contradictory cytokine in that it can induce either cell death or survival after TNF-α binds to its receptor TNF-receptor one (TNFR 1). We propose that TNF-α prolongs survival of resident dendritic cells (DC). Here we demonstrate that TNF-α has an anti-apoptotic effect on DC. TNF-α reduces the activation of caspase 8, 9, and 3, which are critical components of the death pathway. TNF-α also reduces activation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Moreover, we also demonstrate that TNF-α does not affect the activation status of DC. These findings provide support for the role of TNF-α and a link between inflammation and autoimmunity. ...|$|E

25|$|The {{immune system}} must balance between being {{sensitive}} {{enough to protect}} against infection, and become sensitized to attack the body's own proteins (autoimmunity). During an immune reaction to a foreign stimulus, such as bacteria, virus, or allergen, immune cells that would normally be deactivated due to their affinity for <b>self-tissues</b> can be abnormally activated by signaling sequences of antigen-presenting cells. Thus triggers may include viruses, bacteria, allergens (IgE and other hypersensitivity), and can be aggravated by environmental stimulants such as ultraviolet light and certain drug reactions. These stimuli begin a reaction that leads to destruction of other cells {{in the body and}} exposure of their DNA, histones, and other proteins, particularly parts of the cell nucleus. The body's sensitized B-lymphocyte cells will now produce antibodies against these nuclear-related proteins.

40|$|Nonmutated tissue {{differentiation}} antigens {{expressed by}} tumors are attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy, but {{the consequences of}} a highly effective antitumor immune response on <b>self-tissue</b> have not been fully characterized. We found that the infusion of ex vivo expanded adoptively transferred melanoma/melanocyte-specific CD 8 + T cells that mediated robust tumor killing also induced autoimmune destruction of melanocytes in the eye. This severe autoimmunity was associated with the up-regulation of MHC class I molecules in the eye and high levels of IFN-γ derived from both adoptively transferred CD 8 + T cells and host cells. Furthermore, ocular autoimmunity required the presence of the IFN-γ receptor on target tissues. Data compiled from > 200 eyes and tumors in 10 independently performed experiments revealed a highly significant correlation (P < 0. 0001) between the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy and the severity of ocular autoimmunity.

40|$|Inflammation is {{typically}} induced {{in response to}} a microbial infection. The release of proinflammatory cytokines enhances the stimulatory capacity of antigen-presenting cells, as well as recruits adaptive and innate immune effectors to the site of infection. Once the microbe is cleared, inflammation is resolved by various mechanisms to avoid unnecessary tissue damage. Autoimmunity arises when aberrant immune responses target <b>self-tissues</b> causing inflammation. In type 1 diabetes (T 1 D), T cells attack the insulin producing β cells in the pancreatic islets. Genetic and environmental factors increase T 1 D risk by in part altering central and peripheral tolerance inducing events. This results in the development and expansion of β cell-specific effector T cells (Teff) which mediate islet inflammation. Unlike protective immunity where inflammation is terminated, autoimmunity is sustained by chronic inflammation. In this review, we will highlight the key events which initiate and sustain T cell-driven pancreatic islet inflammation in nonobese diabetic mice and in human T 1 D. Specifically, we will discuss: (i) dysregulation of thymic selection events, (ii) the role of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that enhance the expansion and pathogenicity of Teff, (iii) defects which impair homeostasis and suppressor activity of FoxP 3 -expressing regulatory T cells, and (iv) properties of β cells which contribute to islet inflammation...|$|R

The {{transfer of the}} parasite mitochondrial kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) minicircle to the genome of chagasic patients can explain the pathogenesis of the disease; in cases of Chagas' disease with evident cardiomyopathy, the kDNA minicircles integrate mainly into retrotransposons at several chromosomes, but the minicircles are also detected in coding regions of genes that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and immune responses. An accurate evaluation of {{the role played by}} the genotype alterations in the autoimmune rejection of <b>self-tissues</b> in Chagas' disease is achieved with the cross-kingdom chicken model system, which is refractory to T. cruzi infections. The inoculation of T. cruzi into embryonated eggs prior to incubation generates parasite-free chicks, which retain the kDNA minicircle sequence mainly in the macrochromosome coding genes. Crossbreeding transfers the kDNA mutations to the chicken progeny. The kDNA-mutated chickens develop severe cardiomyopathy in adult life and die of heart failure. The phenotyping of the lesions revealed that cytotoxic CD 45, CD 8 + γδ, and CD 8 α+ T lymphocytes carry out the rejection of the chicken heart. These results suggest that the inflammatory cardiomyopathy of Chagas' disease is a genetically driven autoimmune disease...|$|R

However, currently available therapies are associated with important side effects and work only as palliative treatments. Dendritic cells (DCs) have emerged as key players in developing and maintaining adaptive immunity due to their capacity to prime and modulate T cell function. Therefore, because DCs work as central modulators of immune tolerance, it is likely that alterations in their function can lead to the onset of autoimmune-inflammatory diseases. By modulating DC function, novel pathways in antigen-specific tolerance could be established. In this article, the possible contribution of altered DC-T cell interactions to the onset of autoimmunity are discussed. In addition, we expand on the notion that some of the functions of these cells could be relevant targets for intervening therapies aimed to restore the balance or even prevent the loss of tolerance...|$|E

In the present study, we induced diabetes in MBL knockout mice and in wild type C 57 BL/ 6 J mice by low-dose streptozotocin injection and measured blood glucose and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio to monitor development of diabetes. After 24 weeks, fluorescently labelled recombinant MBL was injected intravenously in diabetic MBL knockout mice after which the distribution was investigated using in vivo fluorescence imaging. Mice were subjected to in vivo and ex vivo imaging 24 hours after injection. MBL was found to accumulate in the kidneys of diabetic mice as compared to healthy control mice (p< 0. 0001). These findings support the hypothesis of a significant role of MBL and the complement system in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral immune {{tolerance}} {{is believed to}} be induced by the processing and presentation of <b>self-tissues</b> that die during physiologic tissue turnover. To examine the mechanism that mediates tolerance, we injected mice with dying syngeneic TAP�/ � splenocytes loaded with small amounts of the protein antigen, ovalbumin (OVA). After ingestion and presentation of cellassociated OVA by the CD 8 � subset of dendritic cells in situ, large numbers of antigen-reactive, CD 8 � T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T lymphocytes were driven into cell cycle, but then the T cells were deleted. The animals were also tolerant to challenge with OVA in complete Freund’s adjuvant. An agonistic anti-CD 40 monoclonal antibody was then administered together with the OVA-loaded splenocytes, so that the dendritic cells in the recipient mice would mature. In contrast to observations made in the steady state, the antigen-reactive T cells expanded in numbers for 1 – 2 wk and produced large amounts of interleukin 2 and interferon �, while the animals retained responsiveness to antigen rechallenge. The specific tolerance that develops when dendritic cells process self tissues in the steady state should prevent or reduce the development of autoimmunity when dying cells are subsequently processed during infection. Key words: dendritic cells • peripheral tolerance • CD 8 � T cells • deletion • DC subse...|$|R
40|$|Cells {{from the}} bone marrow can present {{peptides}} that are derived from tumors, transplants, and <b>self-tissues.</b> Here we describe how dendritic cells (DCs) process phagocytosed cell fragments onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II products with unusual efficacy. This was monitored with the Y-Ae monoclonal antibody that is specific for complexes of I-A b MHC class II presenting a peptide derived from I-E�. When immature DCs from I-A b mice were cultured for 5 – 20 h with activated I-E � B blasts, either necrotic or apoptotic, the DCs produced the epitope recognized by the Y-Ae monoclonal antibody and stimulated T cells reactive with the same MHC–peptide complex. Antigen transfer was also observed with human cells, where human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DR � includes the same peptide sequence as mouse I-E�. Antigen transfer was preceded by uptake of B cell fragments into MHC class II–rich compartments. Quantitation {{of the amount of}} I-E protein in the B cell fragments revealed that phagocytosed I-E was 1 – 10 thousand times more efficient in generating MHC–peptide complexes than preprocessed I-E peptide. When we injected different I-E– bearing cells into C 57 BL/ 6 mice to look for a similar phenomenon in vivo, we found that short-lived migrating DCs could be processed by most of the recipient DCs in the lymph node...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} innate {{immune system}} has evolved diverse strategies to distinguish self from microbial nonself. How the {{innate immune system}} distinguishes <b>self-tissues</b> from those of {{other members of the}} same species (allogeneic nonself) is less clear. To address this question, we studied the cutaneous hypersensitivity response of lymphocyte-deficient RAG-/- mice to spleen cells transplanted from either allogeneic or syngeneic RAG-/- donors. We found that RAG-/- mice mount a specific response to allogeneic cells characterized by swelling and infiltration of the skin with host monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils. The response required prior priming with allogeneic splenocytes or skin grafts and exhibited features of memory as it could be elicited at least 4 wk after immunization. Neither depletion of host NK cells nor rechallenging immunized mice with F 1 hybrid splenocytes inhibited the response, indicating that the response is not mediated by NK cells. Depletion of host monocytes/macrophages or neutrophils at the time of rechallenge significantly diminished the response and, importantly, the adoptive transfer of monocytes from alloimmunized RAG-/- mice conferred alloimmunity to naive RAG-/- hosts. Unlike NK- and T cell-dependent alloresponses, monocyte-mediated alloimmunity could be elicited only when donor and responder mice differed at non-MHC loci. These observations indicate that monocytes mount a response to allogeneic nonself, a function not previously attributed to them, and suggest the existence of mammalian innate allorecognition strategies distinct from detection of missing self-MHC molecules by NK cells...|$|R
