A 3 × 2 factorial design was used, which incorporated the <b>sorting</b> <b>conditions</b> (personal Category, PC, Adult Category, AC, and Control, C, conditions), and the number of trials (1 and 2). The latter factor was a within variable. The 5 s were 48 kindergarteners {{with a mean age of}} 6 years and 2 months, who were assigned to one of the three <b>sorting</b> <b>conditions.</b> The list was composed of 16 instances of 4 broadly defined categories (animal, fruit, vehicle,and footgear) as is shown in Table 1. These instances were familiar to children at this age and each of them was presented as black and white line drawings. The 5 s in PC condition were required to group the instances on the basis of their own sorting criteria at the memory phase and then to recall the instances. The 5 s in AC condition were required to group the instances into the four adult categories defined by E and then to recall the instances. The 5 s in C condition were exposed to 16 instances about the same time required of sorfing task under PC and AC conditions and then were required to recall the instances. These memory and recall phases were repeated twice alternately. As is shown in Table 2 and 3, the performances of recall and clustering under PC and AC conditions were significantly better than those under C condition, but there was no difference between PC and AC condition on recall and four clustering measures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to investigate a developmental change in organizational criteria of memory by instruction and category sorting. Kindergarten children and 3 rd grade children were given object drawings which could be classified according to either color or conceptual category in free recall paradigm. The hypotheses to test were {{that there is a}} change from a tendency to organize by color category to a tendency to organize by conceptual category, and that such change was observed more in <b>sorting</b> <b>condition</b> than non-sorting condition. A　 2 × 2 × 2 factoria 1 design was used, which incorporated the instruction conditions (perceptual and conceptual), the <b>sorting</b> <b>conditions</b> (<b>sorting</b> and control), and age levels (kindergartener and 3 rd grader). The Ss were 56 　kindergarteners {{with a mean age of}}　 5. 7 　years and 56 3 rd graders with a mean age of 8. 8 years. Children in each age were assigned to one of the four conditions: Conceptual-sorting, Conceptual-control, Perceptual-sorting, and Perceptual-control conditions. The list was composed of 16 instances of 4 conceptual categories (vegetables, fruits, birds, or flowers) as is shown in the Table 1. Each of the four instances within a category appeared in a different color (red, yellow, purple or white). These instances were familiar to children and each of them was drawing with appropriate color. The experiment was conducted individually. The　Ss in <b>sorting</b> <b>condition</b> were required to group the instances on the basis of either color or conceptual category at the memory phase and then to recall the instances. As is shown in the Table 2 and 5, the performances of recall and clustatenng under conceptual instruction were significantly better than those under perceptual instruction in both kindergartener and 3 rd grader. Unfortunately, such results did not support our hypothesis on the developmental changes in organizational criteria. Recall and clustering were facilitated by sorting and such facilitating effects were observed more clearly under conceptual condition than perceptual condition. These results were discussed with reference to related studies...|$|R

40|$|In this master thesis I {{will present}} my {{research}} which explores the subject/object dynamics of selfawareness within relationships. My research question is this: “Do {{we have the}} ability to see ourselves as an object, and our partner as a subject?” To answer this question I have used the scientific method Q-methodology. Three couples (six subjects) have sorted 40 statements, according to four different <b>sorting</b> <b>conditions.</b> The <b>sorting</b> <b>conditions</b> were: "My perception of myself"; "My perception of my partner"; "My partner’s perception of them self" and "My partner’s perception of me". The participants sorted the statements by how much they agreed, disagreed or were neutral to the them. By doing this the participants were able to express their subjective experience of the topic, which again formed the basis for analysis and interpretation. The statements were generated based on theories concerning subject/object relation and communication, and adapted to the participant’s communication universe. Through factor analysis of the participants Q-sorts I extracted two distinct factors. The two-factor solution represented all participants and 23 of 24 sorts. The factor interpretation revealed that factor 1 has an evolved self-awareness, and views them self as an object and their partner as a subject. Factor 1 has an experience of mutuality in their relationship, and utilizes both verbal and non-verbal communication to obtain information about their partner. Factor 2 appears to be less self-aware and views them self as a subject and their partner as an object. The latter perceives them self as being part of an independent relationship, and primarily uses interpretation of non-verbal communication to obtain information about their partner. The result of the factor interpretation was debated in light of theory and possible implications of the factor views were discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on Applied Microeconomic Theory. The first chapter studies investment incentives in a dynamic random search environment where a seller can make unobservable and selfish investments to reduce his production cost before searching for buyers. In the unique steady state equilibrium, although sellers make positive investments, equilibrium payoffs and the social welfare are a) constant given any search friction and b) equal to the values that would be created {{if there were no}} investment. These results hold even in the limit, with the investment strategy converges to the first best and the stationary investment distribution converges to a point mass at no investment. The second chapter demonstrates how <b>sorting</b> <b>conditions</b> change in search frictions, in a dynamic random matching environment where heterogeneous buyers have private types and heterogeneous sellers make take-it-or-leave-it offers. We first establish the existence ofsteady-state equilibrium and then characterize <b>sorting</b> <b>conditions</b> under two extremesearch frictions. Positive (negative) assortative matching requires the production function to be log-supermodular (log-submodular) with maximal search frictions. When search frictions vanish, the <b>condition</b> forpositive (negative) <b>sorting</b> returns to supermodularity (submodularity). The last chapter examines how patents influence firms' allocation of resources over a portfolio of projects with different non-obviousness. We consider the situation where two identical firms have the replicas of two projects. One is known to be good and the other is risky but is more innovative conditional on being good. Compared to the allocation of resources without any patent, the total amount of resources allocated on the risky project is more efficient. However, the competition for the patent of the safe project also induces firms to inefficiently delay experimenting the risky project. Overall, the welfare effect of patents might be negative...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to investigate effects of category sorting and taxonomic frequency of items upon free recall in kindergarteners. It was hypothesized that facilitative effects of category sorting were greater for the low frequency list than for the high frequency list. A 2 × 2 × 3 factorial design was used, which incorporated taxonomic frequency (high and low) and sorting (sorting and control) and number of trials (1, 2 and 3). The last factor was a within variable. The subjects were 40 kindergarteners {{with a mean age}} of 5 years and 8 months, who were assigned to one of the four conditions: High frequency- Sorting, High frequency-Control, Low frequency-Sorting and Low frequency-Control. Each of high and low frequency lists was composed of 16 items of 4 taxonomic categories in each (animals, fruits, music instruments and vegetables) as is shown in Table 1. These items were familiar to children at this age and were presented in colored pictures. The experiment was conducted individually. Memory and recall phases were repeated thrice. In the first and third trials, a standard free recall paradigm was used in all four <b>conditions</b> and the <b>sorting</b> <b>conditions</b> were introduced in second trial. The first trial was prepared to test memory ability, and the third trial was set to test the transfer effect of sorting in the second trial. As is shown in Table 2, the performance of recall under <b>Sorting</b> <b>conditions</b> were significantly better than that under Control conditions, and the facilitative effects of sorting was greater for low frequency list than for high frequency list. These results supported the present hypothesis and were interpreted to show that category utilization in the low frequency list was more facilitated by category sorting than that in the high frequency list...|$|R
