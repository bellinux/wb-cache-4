5|$|Woodpeckers {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} birds with chisel-like beaks, short legs, stiff tails, and long tongues used for capturing insects. Some <b>species</b> <b>have</b> feet with two toes pointing forward and two backward, while several <b>species</b> <b>have</b> only three toes. Many woodpeckers have {{the habit of}} tapping noisily on tree trunks with their beaks. Nine <b>species</b> <b>have</b> been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos {{prefer to}} eat seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers and insects. They often feed in large flocks, {{particularly}} when ground-feeding. Cockatoos are monogamous and nest in tree hollows.

50|$|Proconsul africanus had {{a dental}} formula of 2:1:2:3 {{on both the}} upper and lower jaws. The molars of this <b>species</b> <b>had</b> thin enamel and there was a {{prominent}} molar cingula. This species also possessed a robust zygomatic bone and a pronounced snout. This <b>species</b> <b>had</b> a broad interorbital region and small frontoethmoidal sinuses. The maxillary sinus was restricted. This <b>species</b> <b>had</b> an auditory region which would be similar to that of extant apes and cercopithecoid monkeys. The ectotympanic tube was well-developed. This species lacked a tail and the canines of this species were sexually dimorphic. The skull lacks supraorbital tori and can be considered somewhat prognathous.

5|$|Lizards have skulls {{with only}} one fenestra on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly {{attached}} which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few <b>species</b> <b>have</b> no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some <b>species</b> <b>have</b> a central parietal eye.|$|E
5|$|Most nuthatches {{breed in}} the {{temperate}} or montane woodlands of the Northern Hemisphere, although two <b>species</b> <b>have</b> adapted to rocky habitats in the warmer and drier regions of Eurasia. However, the greatest diversity is in Southern Asia, and {{similarities between the}} <b>species</b> <b>have</b> {{made it difficult to}} identify distinct species. All members of this genus nest in holes or crevices. Most species are non-migratory and live in their habitat year-round, although the North American red-breasted nuthatch migrates to warmer regions during the winter. A few nuthatch <b>species</b> <b>have</b> restricted ranges and face threats from deforestation.|$|E
5|$|Nematocysts inject venom into prey, {{and usually}} have barbs {{to keep them}} {{embedded}} in the victims. Most <b>species</b> <b>have</b> nematocysts.|$|E
50|$|This <b>species</b> <b>has</b> {{uncertain}} taxonomic status. This <b>species</b> <b>has</b> {{been placed}} by {{itself in the}} genus Pardiglanis. However, some sources have considered this genus to be a junior synonym of Clarotes.|$|R
5000|$|Striped eel catfish is an oviparous fish; this <b>species</b> <b>has</b> {{demersal}} {{eggs and}} planktonic larvae. This <b>species</b> <b>has</b> evolved long ampullary canals in its electrosensory organs (originally termed [...] "ampullae of Lorenzini").|$|R

5|$|Rallidae is a {{large family}} of small to {{medium-sized}} birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most <b>species</b> <b>have</b> strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. Nine <b>species</b> <b>have</b> been recorded in Massachusetts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{name of the}} <b>species</b> <b>has</b> been {{recently}} changed to Abalistes stellatus {{and the author of}} the taxon is now [...] "Anonymous, 1798". The <b>species</b> <b>has</b> also {{been recently}} differentiated from the closely related species Abalistes filamentosus.|$|R
5000|$|This <b>species</b> <b>has</b> a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n = 30, though a cultivated [...] of the <b>species</b> <b>had</b> been reported as having 2n = 28, which botanist Fernando Rivadavia suggested may represent different forms of the species.|$|R
50|$|The <b>species</b> <b>has</b> been {{demonstrated}} to synthesize useful quantities of D-arabinitol, riboflavin, xylitol, and pyruvic acid under thiaminelimitation.

5|$|Some <b>species</b> <b>have</b> {{other modes}} of feeding. Grimpoteuthis has a reduced or {{non-existent}} radula and swallows prey whole. In the deep-sea genus Stauroteuthis, {{some of the}} muscle cells that control the suckers in most <b>species</b> <b>have</b> been replaced with photophores which are believed to fool prey by directing them towards the mouth, making them {{one of the few}} bioluminescent octopuses.|$|E
50|$|This <b>species</b> <b>had</b> five {{pairs of}} upper and {{three pairs of}} lower {{incision}} teeth. The females of the <b>species</b> <b>had</b> eight nipples {{and the opening of}} the pouch was faced backwards, not forwards {{as is the case with}} kangaroos.|$|R
5000|$|The {{species is}} {{distributed}} mostly around the Great Lakes Region, however, the <b>species</b> <b>has</b> also been observed further west in Kansas, Iowa and Colorado. [...] The <b>species</b> <b>has</b> {{been associated with}} the white oak and the gambel oak in Colorado.|$|R
50|$|The <b>species</b> <b>has</b> become {{endangered}} through {{pollution and}} industrial runoff, {{as well as}} collection for the aquarium trade. In response to these dangers, the <b>species</b> <b>has</b> been totally protected in South Australia since 1987, Victoria since at least 1995, and Western Australia since 1991.
