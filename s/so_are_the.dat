5|$|Design {{management}} {{is not a}} standard model that can be projected onto every enterprise, nor is there a specific way of applying it that leads to guaranteed success. Design management processes are carried out by humans with different responsibilities and backgrounds, who work in different industries and enterprises with different sizes and traditions, whilst having different target groups and markets to serve. Design {{management is}} multifaceted, and <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> different applications of and views on design management. The function of design management in an organisation depends on its tasks, authority, and practice.|$|E

5|$|In their {{forty years}} of {{practice}} after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues {{can be in the}} pay of drug companies– often undisclosed– and the journals are too. And <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company. Aside from all this, for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, {{we have no idea what}} the best treatment is, because it's not in anyone's financial interest to conduct any trials at all.|$|E
5|$|More than 200 Upanishads are known, {{of which}} the first dozen or <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> oldest and most {{important}} and {{are referred to as}} the principal or main (mukhya) Upanishads. The mukhya Upanishads are found mostly in the concluding part of the Brahmanas and Aranyakas and were, for centuries, memorized by each generation and passed down orally. The early Upanishads all predate the Common Era, five of them in all likelihood pre-Buddhist (6th century BCE), down to the Maurya period. Of the remainder, 95 Upanishads are part of the Muktika canon, composed from about the last centuries of 1st-millennium BCE through about 15th-century CE. New Upanishads, beyond the 108 in the Muktika canon, continued to be composed through the early modern and modern era, though often dealing with subjects which are unconnected to the Vedas.|$|E
5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) and <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion that}} there should be some {{standard}} correspondence between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the angles of the triangle comes as soon as one recognizes that similar triangles maintain the same ratios between their sides. That is, for any similar triangle the ratio of the hypotenuse (for example) and another of the sides remains the same. If the hypotenuse is twice as long, <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> sides. It is these ratios that the trigonometric functions express.|$|E
25|$|To {{establish}} duality only requires establishing theorems {{which are}} the dual versions of the axioms for the dimension in question. Thus, for 3-dimensional spaces, one needs to show that (1*) every point lies in 3 distinct planes, (2*) every two planes intersect in a unique line and a dual version of (3*) to the effect: if the intersection of plane P and Q is coplanar with the intersection of plane R and S, then <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> respective intersections of planes P and R, Q and S (assuming planes P and S are distinct from Q and R).|$|E
25|$|In a {{conducting}} medium, permittivity {{and index}} of refraction are complex-valued. Consequently, <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> angle of refraction and the wave-vector. This implies that, while the surfaces of constant real phase are planes whose normals make an angle equal to the angle of refraction with the interface normal, the surfaces of constant amplitude, in contrast, are planes parallel to the interface itself. Since these two planes do not in general coincide with each other, the wave {{is said to be}} inhomogeneous. The refracted wave is exponentially attenuated, with exponent proportional to the imaginary component of the {{index of refraction}}.|$|E

25|$|Stone (1936): A Boolean algebra is {{the set of}} all clopen sets of a topological space. It is no {{limitation}} to require the space to be a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff space, or Stone space, that is, every Boolean algebra arises in this way, up to isomorphism. Moreover, if the two Boolean algebras formed as the clopen sets of two Stone spaces are isomorphic, <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Stone spaces themselves, {{which is not the}} case for arbitrary topological spaces. This is just the reverse direction of the duality mentioned earlier from Boolean algebras to Stone spaces. This definition is fleshed out by the next definition.|$|E
25|$|The Nine Tailors {{was adapted}} for {{television}} {{as a series}} of four hour-long episodes in 1973, one of several adaptations of Lord Peter Wimsey novels starring Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter. In a significant plot difference, the original theft of the emeralds was introduced by showing a young Lieutenant Wimsey of the Rifle Brigade attending Henry Thorpe's wedding shortly before the War and unsuccessfully pursuing the fleeing Cranton. (In the books, Wimsey did not join the Army until after the outbreak of the War.) Deacon's escape from prison and the murder of the soldier Arthur Cobbleigh (renamed as Watkins) are also shown in the first episode. <b>So</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> circumstances under which Bunter becomes Lord Peter's valet.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, all {{the buzz}} about the Packer affair, which looked such a menace in 78, died down {{within a year}} or so, as the richest man in Australia and the ICC managed to reach an agreement. Yet, the changes {{introduced}} by Packer have not only lasted for a considerable time, in fact, these have continued to produce more changes to the game. Cricket is now fully internationalized, {{and at the same time}} fully commercialized. International stars are now richly paid (and <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> commentators), thanks mainly to the backings and blessings of satellite TV channels. In a sense, Packer was a bit too ahead of his time.|$|E

25|$|Others, {{especially}} Isaac Hirsch Weiss, {{object that}} many tosafot— {{particularly those of}} Isaiah di Trani— have no reference to Rashi. Weiss, followed by other scholars, asserts that tosafot means additions to the Talmud, that is to say, they are an extension {{and development of the}} Talmud. For just as the Gemara is a critical and analytical commentary on the Mishnah, <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Tosafot critical and analytical glosses on those two parts of the Talmud. Further, the term tosafot was not applied {{for the first time to}} the glosses of Rashi's continuators, but to the Tosefta, the additions to the Mishnah compiled by Judah ha-Nasi I. Tosefta is a Babylonian term, which in Jerusalem writings is replaced by tosafot. The Tosafot resemble the Gemara in other respects also, for just as the latter is the work of different schools carried on through a long period, so the former were written at different times and by different schools, and gathered later into one body.|$|E
25|$|However, Crest's {{origin point}} {{has also been}} erased, so the party heads to Balance Valley to restore it. There, they {{encounter}} Argo (Tomomichi Nishimura/Neil Ross), who tells them the young Crest has died, and only his apprentice, Lin (Fumiko Orikasa/Kim Mai Guest) remains. Max and Monica decide to rewrite Crest's history {{so as to avoid}} his death. They head to the Moon Crystal Lighthouse where he died, and travel into the past where they see Lin and Crest (Susumu Chiba/Scott McAfee) attacked by the warship Death Ark, captained by Gaspard (Takahiro Sakurai/Rino Romano), the man who killed Monica's father. They are unable to prevent Crest's death, but Lin, inspired by Crest's successful attempt to save the lighthouse's moon crystal, vows to become a legendary sage herself. Max and Monica go to the future, where they meet Madam Crest – an elderly Lin - who tells them Griffon comes from 10,000 years in the past. The atlamillia cannot make such a jump, and Lin says the only people capable of doing <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> scientists at the Luna Lab.|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, {{in such a way that}} they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion. In their forty years of practice after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues can be in the pay of drug companies – often undisclosed – and the journals are too. And <b>so</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure.|$|E
