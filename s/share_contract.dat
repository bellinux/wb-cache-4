40|$|The paper aims to {{understand}} buyer-supplier power and dependence scenarios following a risk <b>sharing</b> <b>contract.</b> The study develops {{a supply chain}} risk <b>sharing</b> <b>contract</b> to mitigate demand uncertainty and price volatility related risks in a globalised business environment. An integer programming model is developed and analysed following an automotive case study to generate insights into buyer-supplier relationships. Multiple buyer-supplier power and dependence scenarios are considered to reflect the possible leverages involved in the decision-making. The situational strength evaluated through buyer-supplier power and dependence illuminates the inherent complexity in contract negotiation. Thus there is an evident need to develop risk <b>sharing</b> <b>contracts</b> for mitigating global risks. The developed relationship framework and risk <b>sharing</b> <b>contract</b> model are expected to help SC managers in better understanding behavioural aspects during contract negotiations. The risk <b>sharing</b> <b>contract</b> model proposed here also contributes to a potentially novel perspective on existing theory in buyer-supplier power and dependence by providing a relational perspective on the dynamics of supply chain design and collaboration...|$|R

Economists have suggested that firms use share contracts rather than wage contracts as one possible solution to downsizing. In my experimental setting employment contracting involves an employer who hires two employees to produce output. In each of 31 rounds, employees choose between a wage contract (status quo) and a <b>share</b> <b>contract</b> with an employer-set sharing rule. I manipulate whether the <b>share</b> <b>contract</b> incorporates a form of mutual monitoring and examine the effects on employee effort, contract preference, and welfare.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} features of remuneration in Hawaii’s longline fisheries industry has been the norm of <b>share</b> <b>contract</b> regimes. This paper investigates whether the use of the <b>share</b> <b>contract</b> regime is positively correlated to increased economic returns. The principal-agent framework is applied to develop a theoretical model for the remuneration choice. Empirical estimation is conducted using a switching regression model that accounts for the effects of certain vessel characteristics on revenue, depending on remuneration regime used (i. e., <b>share</b> <b>contract</b> or flat wage), as well as the potential selection bias in the vessels ’ contractual choice. Key findings from counterfactual simula-tions indicate: (a) a negative selection related to choosing share contracts, and (b) flat wage vessels would experience significantly higher revenues if they switched to share contracts. Thus, even though the labor market in Hawaii’s longline fisheries relies upon foreign crew members, the results suggest that owners of flat wage vessels would benefit by applying share contracts to increase their revenues...|$|E

Using this model, we analyse {{the implications of the}} <b>share</b> <b>contract</b> for quantity and quality, often ignored in previous analysis.

40|$|Two {{means by}} which {{commodity}} producers can reduce their exposure to quantity risk are <b>share</b> <b>contracting</b> and futures hedging. This paper explains the coexistence of these arrangements by showing that these will normally be complementary means of transferring risk. <b>Share</b> <b>contracting</b> by a purchaser with many producers can help diversify imperfectly correlated quantity risks. Futures contracts, on the other hand, hedge the systematic but not the idiosyncratic components of output risk. Thus, futures hedging helps to ameliorate the main disadvantage of multiple <b>share</b> <b>contracting,</b> an excessive loading of systematic risk on the purchaser.

It is argued here that despite the asymmetric information in their models, {{it is possible to}} achieve an efficient allocation of resources without the use of <b>share</b> <b>contracts,</b> by having tenants organize production. An alternative model is then given where efficiency cannot be achieved in this way because the quality of land as well as the ability of tenants is unobservable.

30|$|Contribution to the {{variance}} of NPV under the production <b>share</b> <b>contract</b> is shown in Fig.  8 b. According to Fig.  8 b, we conclude that the oil price randomness has the greatest impact, OOIP ranks second; the cost recovery rate also has a great impact, while Opex per barrel has a small impact. Under the assumed production <b>share</b> <b>contract</b> in this paper, sales income is assessed when the produced oil is sold, then the royalty is paid. After that, the limit of cost oil is decided by the net income (i.e., sales income minus royalty) and cost recovery rate, and then the actual recovered cost is determined by available and forwarded production costs. Therefore, the cost recovery rate has a great influence on NPV, but the influence depends on the cost recovery mechanism. Overall, {{the influence of the}} cost recovery rate is not direct, consequently, its impact is relatively low. The impacts of oil price, OOIP, Opex per barrel are analyzed later.|$|E

The central issue considered is how specific contractual terms are related to the attitudes toward risk of the individuals. In carrying through with this exercise, we examine the actual contract in order to restrict the contracts considered to a subset of those which are theoretically possible. For instance, a <b>share</b> <b>contract</b> may involve monitoring by the principal but since the actual sugar beet contract does not, we assume that the cost of monitoring outweigh the benefits; instead of trying to characterize the forces which give rise to a contract which does not involve monitoring.;Once the theoretical analysis is completed, a simulation experiment then shows how the terms of the contract and input use respond to changes in the attitudes toward risk of principal and the agents, along with adjustments in the characteristics of their subjective probability distributions...|$|E
