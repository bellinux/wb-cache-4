30|$|In this paper, a new {{control chart}} was {{initially}} proposed {{based on a}} transformation method to monitor multi-attribute processes. The transformation method was used to eliminate the skewness of multivariate binomial processes. Then, the MLE of change points designed for both <b>step</b> <b>changes</b> and linear-trend disturbances were derived. Using Monte Carlo simulation experiments involving multivariate binomial processes with two and five attributes, the performances of the change-point estimators were evaluated by comparing them {{in the presence of}} real step-change and real linear-trend disturbances. The results showed that the change-point estimator designed for <b>step</b> <b>changes</b> outperforms the change-point estimator designed for linear-trend disturbances when the true change type is a step-change disturbance, regardless of the shift magnitudes and process dimensions. In contrast, the change-point estimator designed for linear-trend disturbances outperforms the change-point estimator designed for <b>step</b> <b>changes</b> when the true change type is a linear-trend disturbance, regardless of the shift magnitudes and process dimensions.|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{clinical}} {{use of an}} automatic feedback control system to adjust the end‐tidal anaesthetic concentration with a low‐flow method. The end‐tidal controller uses two input signals (the end‐tidal and inspiratory concentrations) to control the isoflurane concentration in the fresh gas flow, using a model‐based algorithm. We studied 22 ASA I-III patients during elective surgery lasting more than 2 h. The anaesthetist was asked to make four <b>step</b> <b>changes</b> of the target end‐tidal concentration (+ 0. 3, + 0. 6, - 0. 3, - 0. 6 vol%), either manually (Group A) or by setting the target value for the feedback controller (Group B), and then the control was <b>changed</b> and the <b>step</b> <b>changes</b> were repeated, in a crossover design. Eighty <b>step</b> <b>changes</b> with each control method were compared in terms of response time, maximal overshoot and stability. The automatic control system was more accurate and stable than the human controller for step increases and step decreases, with less overshoot/undershoot and greater stability [e. g. maximal overshoot 14. 7 (sd 3. 7) % and 18 (8. 1) % respectively for + 0. 6 vol% <b>step</b> <b>changes,</b> and 19. 8 (3. 7) % and 30. 7 (13. 2) % respectively for + 0. 3 vol% step changes]. However, the automatic control system showed a faster response time than the manual method only with large increasing steps (e. g. 149 (32) s and 205 (57) s respectively for + 0. 6 vol% <b>step</b> <b>changes)</b> and was not different from manual control for decreasing steps. Automatic control of the end‐tidal isoflurane concentration can be better than human control in a clinical setting, and this task could be done automatically. Br J Anaesth 2000; 85 : 818 - 2...|$|R

40|$|Statistical models used to {{estimate}} the spatio-temporal pattern in disease risk from areal unit data often represent the risk surface for each time period in terms of known covariates {{and a set of}} spatially smooth random effects. The latter act as a proxy for unmeasured spatial confounding, whose spatial structure is often characterised by a spatially smooth evolution between some pairs of adjacent areal units while other pairs exhibit large <b>step</b> <b>changes.</b> This spatial heterogeneity is not consistent with a global smoothing model in which partial correlation exists between all pairs of adjacent spatial random effects, and a novel space-time disease model with an adaptive spatial smoothing specification that can identify <b>step</b> <b>changes</b> is therefore proposed. The new model is motivated by a new study of respiratory and circulatory disease risk across the set of Local Authorities in England, and is rigorously tested by simulation to assess its efficacy.

2500|$|A lot of {{research}} is currently being carried out {{in order to make}} EEG devices smaller, more portable and easier to use.

Obtained Bodenstein numbers for <b>step</b> <b>changes</b> from nitrogen to a helium/nitrogen mixture and vice versa differ by as much as a factor ten, depending on the helium concentration and column pressure. The difference in axial dispersion may be ascribed to gravitation-driven instabilities as due to vertical density gradients {{in the case of a}} heavy gas displaced by a light gas; density gradients in the <b>step</b> <b>changes</b> from a light to heavy gas evidently inhibit axial dispersion.
