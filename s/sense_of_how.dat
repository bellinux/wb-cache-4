5|$|One of {{the castle}} meres can still be seen to the west {{of the castle}}, {{although}} in the 16th century there were two lakes, much larger than today, complete with a wharf. This dramatic use of water to reflect the image of the castle is similar to that used at several other castles of the period, including Bredwardine and Ravensworth Castle. Water castles such as Framlingham made greater use of water than was necessary for defence and enhanced the appearance of the castle. The view from the Great Hall in the Inner Court would originally have included the gardens of the Lower Court, and these would have then been framed by the mere and the Great Park beyond. The area around the castle today remains a designed and managed landscape; although the Great Park is now covered by fields, the view still gives a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the castle and landscape was meant to appear to its late medieval owners.|$|E

A majority of applications are rejected but reapplying is allowed and sometimes encouraged. The same standards apply to editors of all categories and subcategories.|$|E

25|$|Steering a ship {{effectively}} requires skills {{gained through}} training and experience. An expert helmsman has a keen <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> a particular ship {{will respond to}} the helm or how different sea conditions impact steering. For instance, experience teaches a helmsman the ability to correct the rudder in advance of a ship substantially falling off course. This requires the capacity to anticipate the delay between when the helm is applied and when the ship responds to the rudder. Similarly, a skilled helmsman will avoid overcompensating for a ship's movement caused by local conditions, such as wind, swells, currents, or rough seas.|$|E
25|$|Meredith Starr met Meher Baba in Toka, India on 30 June 1928. In 1931 Starr {{established}} a retreat center at East Challacombe, North Devon (a {{couple of miles}} from Combe Martin), where he invited Meher Baba to come and meet westerners. It was at the Devon retreat that many of Meher Baba's lasting followers from Europe and the United States first met Baba. Meredith was famously lacking {{in a sense of}} humor and had a particular <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> spiritual conduct should be, thus enforcing strong codes of serious contemplative conduct that made even Meher Baba uncomfortable. Yet he is considered to have {{played a central role in}} introducing Meher Baba to the western world.|$|E
25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we think of ourselves as having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years, {{they were more}} {{interested}} in the acoustics of speech. For instance, they were looking at the differences between /ba/ or /da/, but now research has been directed to the response in the brain from the stimuli. In recent years, there has been a model developed to create a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> speech perception works; this model is known as the Dual Stream Model. This model has drastically changed from how psychologists look at perception. The first section of the Dual Stream Model is the ventral pathway. This pathway incorporates middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal sulcus and perhaps the inferior temporal gyrus. The ventral pathway shows phonological representations to the lexical or conceptual representations, which is the meaning of the words. The second section of the Dual Stream Model is the dorsal pathway. This pathway includes the sylvian parietotemporal, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, and premotor cortex. Its primary function is to take the sensory or phonological stimuli and transfer it into an articulatory-motor representation (formation of speech).|$|E
25|$|Rowe and Koetter were not, however, championing collage in the {{pictorial}} sense, much less seeking {{the types of}} disruptions of meaning that occur with collage. Instead, they were looking to challenge the uniformity of Modernism and saw collage with its non-linear notion of history {{as a means to}} reinvigorate design practice. Not only does historical urban fabric have its place, but in studying it, designers were, so it was hoped, able to get a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> better to operate. Rowe {{was a member of the}} so-called Texas Rangers, a group of architects who taught at the University of Texas for a while. Another member of that group was Bernhard Hoesli, a Swiss architect who went on to become an important educator at the ETH-Zurirch. Whereas for Rowe, collage was more a metaphor than an actual practice, Hoesli actively made collages as part of his design process. He was close to Robert Slutzky, a New York-based artist, and frequently introduced the question of collage and disruption in his studio work.|$|E

500|$|Heller was {{responsible}} for writing the episode's voice-over, despite his dislike of the task.

He said, [...] "I {{think this is the}} first time that we get sense of the version of Rome that the show is pushing," [...] which was a very different version than viewers may have been used to. To him, Rome was [...] "colorful and painted" [...] and cosmopolitan. A later scene featuring Cicero the Younger in the Senate proved difficult to film because of the large number of Italian extras who did not speak English. In the DVD audio commentary, he said that [...] "this is one of those scenes where you need really great assistant directors, because all of these Italian extras who have no idea whatsoever what [...] saying, so to keep them interested and focused and concentrated on what's going on is a real trick." ...|$|E
500|$|According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's poetry can {{be placed}} within the African-American oral tradition, and her prose [...] "follows classic {{technique}} in nonpoetic Western forms". [...] O'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a [...] "monolithic black language", and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale calls a [...] "more expected ghetto expressiveness". [...] McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation {{between her and her}} audience. [...] As McWhorter states, [...] "I have never read autobiographical writing where I had such a hard time summoning a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the subject talks, or a sense of who the subject really is". [...] McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou's books, like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak as one would expect, and that their speech is [...] "cleaned up" [...] for her readers. [...] Guy, for example, represents the young black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou's text, is intended to prove that blacks can use standard English competently.|$|E
