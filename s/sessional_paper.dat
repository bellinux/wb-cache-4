5|$|In 1986, <b>Sessional</b> <b>Paper</b> Number 1 was {{published}} by the Government of Kenya, outlining the country's need for economic development and growth. The document stressed the government opinion that the airline {{would be better off}} privately owned, thus resulting in the first privatisation attempt. The government named Philip Ndegwa as Chairman of the Board in 1991, with specific orders to make the airline a privately owned company. In 1992, the Public Enterprise Reform paper {{was published}}, giving Kenya Airways priority among national companies in Kenya to be privatised. Ndegwa was succeeded by Isaac Omolo Okero. In , Brian Davies, was appointed as the new managing director of the company. Davies had been previously hired to carry out a study of viability on privatisation, working for British Airways' Speedwing consulting arm. Swissair was the first company to provide Kenya Airways with privatisation advice. In the fiscal year 1993 to 1994, the airline produced its first profit since the start of commercialisation. In 1994, the International Finance Corporation was appointed to provide assistance in the privatisation process, which effectively began in 1995. A large aviation industry partner was sought to acquire 40% of the shares, with another 40% reserved for private investors and the government keeping the remaining stake. The government would absorb almost million in debts and would convert another million it provided in loans into equity; after reorganisation, the company would have a debt of approximate million. British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa and South African Airways were among the airlines expressing interest in taking a stake in Kenya Airways.|$|E
25|$|As Kenya gained {{independence}} in 1963, attempts at simplifying {{the administration of}} water supply resulted in the transferral of all organisations responsible for water to the Ministry of Agriculture in 1964. The distribution of responsibilities and authority was, however, unclear and led to bottlenecks and inefficiencies. In 1965 the government led by Jomo Kenyatta stated in the <b>Sessional</b> <b>Paper</b> No. 10 on African Socialism and its Application to Planning in Kenya that government policy had to be directed towards the eradication of poverty, illiteracy and disease.|$|E

However, with the adoption of <b>Sessional</b> <b>Paper</b> No. 10 of 1965 in Kenya's parliament and the resignation of left leaning politicians allied to Oginga Odinga, it pursued a mixed market economic policy, with state intervention {{in the form of}} parastatals. It steered Kenya to side with the west during the cold war, with both Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel Moi using apparent links to the Soviet Union as pretexts to crush political dissent.|$|E

He also established an Industrial Court to hear labour-management cases. He was later {{appointed to the}} Economic Planning Ministry. Together with Finance Minister Mwai Kibaki, he issued <b>Sessional</b> <b>Paper</b> 10, which defined Kenya’s form of economic policies.

5000|$|In December 1942, Senanayake {{became the}} Leader of the House and Vice Chairman of the Board of Ministers in the State Council, upon the {{retirement}} of Sir Baron Jayatilaka, Minister of Home Affairs. On 26 May 1943, the British Government made the Whitehall Declaration of 1943 on Ceylon constitutional change, which enabled ministers to make submissions. [...] This bypassed the Governor, who called for a commission from the colonial office to halt {{the activities of the}} ministers. Senanayake resigned from the National Congress disagreeing with its resolution on independence and instead approached the commission with his proposal of dominion status and they accepted the ministers' submissions, publishing these in the <b>Sessional</b> <b>Paper</b> XIV of 1944. In 1944, the Soulbury Commission was formed. In 1945, following Labour's win in the 1945 general election, he proceeded to London and met the newly appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies, George Hall. Senanayake's submissions were accepted, resulting in self-government short of independence for Ceylon. He resigned his ministry in 1946 to push for full independence. That year he formed the United National Party (UNP) by amalgamating three right-leaning pro-Dominion parties.|$|E
5000|$|At the Federal level, {{progress}} began later. In August 1955, the House of Representatives {{called on}} the Council of Ministers to present proposals towards the Nigerianisation of the civil service. In March 1956, the council presented before the House, <b>Sessional</b> <b>Paper</b> No.4 of 1956, a statement policy on Nigerianisation. The council proposed that a new position, the Office of the Nigerianisation Officer be created and increased level of post-secondary school training of Nigerians so as {{to meet the needs}} of the public service. To ensure the success of the proposals three training programmes were to be instituted. Senior Training, Intermediate Training and Preliminary Training. [...] Three major governmental bodies where charged with implementing the process: the Public Service Commission, Scholarship Board and the establishment office.Each ministry was mandated to keep tabs on departmental needs and Nigerians in training who could fit the staff needs. The process also involved recruitment of Nigerian students in U.K. for administrative positions at home. While the number of Nigerians in senior positions was 786 out of a total of 5,125, in 1961 the figure had increased to 3,030 out of a total of 5,133. By 1965, the process of Nigerianisation had virtually been completed in the Federal Service and at the regional levels.|$|E
