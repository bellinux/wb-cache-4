40|$|Migratory birds track {{seasonal}} resources {{across and}} between continents. We propose a general strategy of tracking the broad seasonal abundance of resources throughout the annual cycle in the longest-distance migrating land birds {{as an alternative}} to tracking a certain climatic niche or shorter-term resource surplus occurring, for example, during spring foliation. Whether and how this is possible for complex annual spatiotemporal schedules is not known. New tracking technology enables unprecedented spatial and temporal mapping of long-distance movement of birds. We show that three Palearctic-African species track vegetation greenness throughout their annual cycle, adjusting the timing and direction of migratory movements with seasonal changes in resource availability over Europe and Africa. Common cuckoos maximize the vegetation greenness, whereas red-backed shrikes and thrush nightingales track <b>seasonal</b> <b>surplus</b> in greenness. Our results demonstrate that the longest-distance migrants move between consecutive staging areas even within the wintering region in Africa to match seasonal variation in regional climate. End-of-century climate projections indicate that optimizing greenness would be possible but that vegetation surplus might be more difficult to track in the future...|$|E
40|$|Communities in {{the coastal}} regions of {{south-western}} Bangladesh currently experience severe seasonal water scarcity and groundwater sources of unsuitable salinity. Aquifer storage, transfer and recovery (ASTR), using a <b>seasonal</b> <b>surplus</b> of potable water, is being tested as a potential low-cost (less than $ 8000 USD) water supply alternative for these communities. A variable-density numerical groundwater model was developed to investigate the engineering technical feasibility of small-scale ASTR systems for the coastal communities in Bangladesh and specifically to support future field site selection and system design. The numerical model was calibrated based on an existing ASTR site and applied to {{explore the influence of}} a range of hydrogeological and engineering design parameters. Simulations showed that the water extracted from the ASTR system was able to meet the Bangladesh Drinking Water Standard for Total Dissolved Solids of 1 g/L when injection head or aquifer transmissivity was maximized. A generic ASTR model was developed to examine systems in a non-site-specific context. This analysis showed that four injection wells distributed around a central extraction well with system parameters configured to produce a single injection well plume diameter 1. 5 times greater than the level of dispersivity in the system led to high recovery efficiencies regardless of other site characteristics such as injection rate, aquifer depth, and effective porosity...|$|E
40|$|In Gulf countries, most {{power plants}} are {{co-generation}} power desalting plants (CPDP) that generate electric energy and also produce fresh water through the desalination of seawater. This paper provides detailed technical and economical analyses {{to evaluate a}} new generation of dual purpose technology that includes the integration of reverse osmosis (RO) processes with existing thermal desalination processes and power generation (triple hybrid system) at Layyah plant, Sharjah, UAE. Hybridization of sweater reverse osmosis (SWRO) and the multi-stage flash (MSF) technology was considered to improve the performance of latter and reduce the cost of the produced water. Moreover, “idle” power in winter (<b>seasonal</b> <b>surplus</b> of unused power) was mainly utilized by RO to further reduce the cost of the hybrid system for six months of the year. Spinning reserve was also used to further reduce the cost of the proposed hybrid system. Integration ofthe three processes of MSF, MED, and RO desalination technologies could be made at different levels through which the resulting of water cost will depend on the selected configuration and the cost of materials of construction, equipment, membrane, energy, etc. Thus, the capital and annual operating costs were calculated for all potential alternatives for various plant capacities. It was found that for all plant capacities, integrated hybrid systems resulted in most cost effective solution. For example, at a capacity of 50 MIGD, the present worth of the cost was calculated to be 588. 7, 443. 2, and 380 million US$ for MSF, MED, and hybrid RO systems, respectively...|$|E

Preservation is also the means of dealing with <b>seasonal</b> <b>surpluses</b> to provide supplies during times of shortage. A number of simple preservation techniques suitable for small-scale preservation, such as at the household or village level, are describe in this booklet. The emphasis is on 'small-scale', to inform individuals how to process and store their surplus economically. In {{order to be able}} to preserve foods correctly knowledge of the causes of spoilage is needed and so the booklet begins with a discussion of spoilage and its prevention. The principles and methods of preservation are explained and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are described.

30|$|Our review {{identified}} two innovative approaches. First, in drought-affected areas (e.g. the Horn of Africa regions and {{many parts of}} sub-Saharan Africa), agricultural input credit schemes may be interlinked with insurance to enhance access to credit services and improve adoption of improved agricultural technologies (Carter 2009). This offers the dual benefit of reducing the lenders’ and borrowers’ risk {{which has been the}} major obstacle for provision of input credit and for farmer adoption of complementary inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds. It will enhance the uptake of weather index insurance when it is linked to a trusted delivery mechanism (or supplier) and bundled with the supply of key inputs. The complementary use of insurance and credit may in the long term facilitate poverty reduction through technical change, asset building and resilience to diverse shocks. In order to leverage these gains, mandatory insurance may be required (e.g. India) for farmers borrowing to finance inputs. Second, case studies from Ethiopia showed the attractiveness of linking weather index insurance with productive safety net programs (food-for-work or cash-for-work). This allows cash-constrained households to use their <b>seasonal</b> <b>surplus</b> labor to buy insurance against drought while building public goods local infrastructure or assets, which will enhance resilience or access to markets. Even in this case, payouts cannot be directly linked to farm level losses rather than payments for consumption smoothing to avoid famine situations. However, robust indices are still needed before the large-scale popularization of the insurance-for-work model. Future success in commercializing the product at the micro-level would depend on to what extent weather index insurance will be attractive to smallholder producers in risk-prone regions, who often prefer informal systems and tighten their belts, diversify crops, borrow from friends or neighbors rather than invest in formal insurance mechanisms or productive assets that may be risky but provide a higher return.|$|E
40|$|There are 15 {{methods of}} {{traditional}} processed {{fruits and vegetables}} illustrated in this report. Each process {{can be applied to}} the other kinds of fruit and vegetable. These processes are the old methods which are used to preserve the <b>seasonal</b> <b>surpluses</b> of fruits and vegetables in Thailand. According to the principles of food preservation, they are divided into four methods, i. e. drying by sun-drying or evaporation to produce high total solid products, addition of sugar, salt, acid, or combination of them at high concentration, fermentation, and canning. Most of the traditional processed foods are produced in the horn?-scale industries. Some products are made day to day and sold directly to consumers. In the past, many products had low quality and short shelflife due to the lack of basic technology and careless of hygienic practice. Recently, basic technology has been transferred to producers by short-course training, personal contact, self-study from newspapers, magazines, text-books and scientific journals.

40|$|Freezing {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as a dependable and economical method of preserving perishable foods. Particularly within {{the last two or}} three decades many advances have been made in this field. There is no doubt today that the art and science of freezing technology have advanced to a point where one can obtain many high quality, nutritious and economical frozen foods. The dairy industry is continually being faced with the problem of <b>seasonal</b> <b>surpluses</b> and shortages. Any technique which would allow surpluses to be carried over into shortage periods would be highly desirable to this industry. Frozen milks may be one such answer. Milk can be produced at lower cost during the spring and summer than during the fall and winter, therefore, it would be an advantage to process milk into such forms that will be suitable for future use. Storage of frozen concentrated milk appears to have possibilities in aiding the needs of the industry and to supply the fluid milk trade with high-quality milk. Furthermore, concentrated milk may have a place in non-milk-producing areas, particularly where transportation is an important cost factor. Though frozen cream has been a standard product in the manufacture of ice cream mixes, the freezing of fluid and concentrated milks for direct consumption has not been practised on any large scale. A frozen three-to-one concentrated milk is not a new product since experimental work goes back to the early 1930 's. However, technical advances, as compared with other industries, were slow, probably due to the unique physical and chemical properties of milk. Protein instability and flavor deterioration have been the main obstacles, either of which limits the storage period. As the storage period is extended this product will undoubtedly develop greater potentials. Since frozen concentrated milk is a food product, attention must be given to the bacterial flora. Further, to add to the knowledge of a comparatively new product and in hope of obtaining information applicable to the industry, studies have been undertaken to determine the effects of processing and storage on the numbers and types of bacteria in frozen concentrated milk...|$|R

40|$|The Budyko {{framework}} elegantly {{reduces the}} complex spatial patterns of actual evapotranspiration and runoff {{to a general}} function of two variables: mean annual precipitation (MAP) and net radiation. While the methodology has first-order skill, departures from a globally averaged curve can be significant and may be usefully attributed to additional controls such as vegetation type. This paper explores the magnitude of such departures as detected from flux tower measurements of ecosystem-scale evapotranspiration, and investigates their attribution to site characteristics (biome, seasonal rainfall distribution, and frozen precipitation). The global synthesis (based on 167 sites with 764 tower-years) shows smooth transition from water-limited to energy-limited control, broadly consistent with catchment-scale relations and explaining 62 % of the across site variation in evaporative index (the fraction of MAP consumed by evapotranspiration). Climate and vegetation types act as additional controls, combining to explain an additional 13 % {{of the variation in}} evaporative index. Warm temperate winter wet sites (Mediterranean) exhibit a reduced evaporative index, 9 % lower than the average value expected based on dryness index, implying elevated runoff. <b>Seasonal</b> hydrologic <b>surplus</b> explains a small but significant fraction of variance in departures of evaporative index from that expected for a given dryness index. Surprisingly, grasslands on average have a higher evaporative index than forested landscapes, with 9 % more annual precipitation consumed by annual evapotranspiration compared to forests. In sum, the simple framework of supply-or demand-limited evapotranspiration is supported by global FLUXNET observations but climate type and vegetation type are seen to exert sizeable additional controls...|$|R
40|$|Whey is a {{co-product}} {{of processes}} {{for the production}} of cheese and casein that retains most of the lactose content in milk. World production of whey is estimated around 200 million tons per year with an increase rate of about 2 %/per year. Milk production is <b>seasonal,</b> so <b>surplus</b> whey is unavoidable. Traditionally, whey producers have considered it as a nuisance and strategies of whey handling have been mostly oriented to their more convenient disposal. This vision has been steadily evolving because of the upgrading potential of whey major components (lactose and whey proteins), but also because of more stringent regulations of waste disposal. Only the big cheese manufacturing companies are in the position of implementing technologies for their recovery and upgrading, so there is a major challenge in incorporating medium and small size producers to a platform of whey utilization, conciliating industrial interest with environmental protection within the framework of sustainable development. Within this context, among the many technological options for whey upgrading, transformation of whey components by enzyme biocatalysis appears as prominent. In fact, enzymes are green catalysts that can perform a myriad of transformation reactions under mild conditions and with strict specificity, so reducing production costs and environmental burden. This review pretends to highlight the impact of biocatalysis within a platform of whey upgrading. Technological options are shortly reviewed and then an in-depth and critical appraisal of enzyme technologies for whey upgrading is presented, with a special focus on newly developed enzymatic processes of organic synthesis, where the added value is high, being then a powerful driving force for industrial implementation...|$|R
5000|$|Agriculture in Mesoamerica {{dates to}} the Archaic period of Mesoamerican {{chronology}} (8000-2000 BC). [...] At {{the beginning of the}} Archaic period, the Early Hunters of the late Pleistocene era (50,000-10,000 BC) led nomadic lifestyles, relying on hunting and gathering for sustenance. However, the nomadic lifestyle that dominated the late Pleistocene and the early Archaic slowly transitioned into a more sedentary lifestyle as the hunter gatherer micro-bands in the region began to cultivate wild plants. The cultivation of these plants provided security to the Mesoamericans, allowing them to increase surplus of [...] "starvation foods" [...] near <b>seasonal</b> camps; this <b>surplus</b> could be utilized when hunting was bad, during times of drought, and when resources were low. The cultivation of plants could have been started purposefully, or by accident. The former could have been done by bringing a wild plant closer to a camp site, or to a frequented area, so it was easier access and collect. The latter could have happened as certain plant seeds were eaten and not fully digested, causing these plants to grow wherever human habitation would take them.|$|R

Statistical models, for the current climate, {{of the relationship between}} <b>seasonal</b> moisture <b>surplus</b> (Thornthwaite water budget method) and seasonal river discharge were built for nine watersheds in Minnesota. Global Climate Model predicted temperature changes and precipitation ratios were used to adjust the observed climatic record. The moisture surplus values were recalculated for this doubled C 02 world and became the predictor variables in the statistical models. The results indicate a general and substantial decrease in river discharge. However, there is great spatial variation in the magnitude of the decrease. Mean annual discharge decreases ranged from 0. 3 % for the St. Louis River to 18 % for the Blue Earth River. The individual annual discharges were about evenly split between increases and decreases for the St. Louis River while there were only four years (out of 47) with increased discharge for the Blue Earth River. All nine basins showed increased discharge during the first season (three months) of the year largely because increased temperatures shifted the snow melt period to an earlier month. The second season (April through June) had most extensive and largest decreases. In the third season (July through September) decreases were large (13 % to 31 %) for the southern and central river basins but were modest (2 % to 7 %) for the northern basins. During the last three months of the year, five basins had increased discharge and four basins, especially the Mississippi at both Anoka and St. Paul, had decreases. Thus, the southern and central portions of Minnesota would experience substantial decreases in discharge but the northern third of the state would see only modest decreases.

40|$|The {{story of}} {{microbial}} biotransformation is {{closely associated with}} vinegar production, which dates back to around 2000 years BC. However, among fermented foods, vinegar has been always considered a “poor” component: {{it is not a}} “food”, it doesn’t have high nutritional values, and it is produced by transformation of other more nutritive rich fermented foods. Vinegar is a condiment, but also a preservative and, in some countries, a healthy drink. It can be made by a two step fermentation of yeasts followed by acetic acid bacteria from almost any fermentable carbohydrate source: apples, pears, grapes, honey, syrups, cereals, hydrolysed starches, beer, and wine are all ideal substrates for the production of vinegar. Since vinegars is, with few exceptions, an inexpensive commodity, its production requires a low-cost raw material, such as sub-standard fruits, <b>seasonal</b> agricultural <b>surpluses,</b> various food processing by-products and fruit waste. However there are vinegars, so called spirit vinegars, obtained directly by acetic oxidation of alcohol obtained from distillation of fermented mashes or, in some countries, petrolchemical ethanol. Some western by-products of wood carbonization obtained by distillation of pyroligneous liquor collected during wood pyrolisis, are called “vinegar” and they are used as agricultural material, animal health product, cosmetic ingredients and folk drug in Japan and Est-Asia (Mu et al., 2003; Mu et al., 2006). These distilled solutions have not be considered as vinegar because no fermentative process occurs in their production. Other specialty vinegars are grouped as herbal or fruit vinegars. In this cases the name “X vinegar” doesn’t indicate the raw materials used in vinegar fermentation but the flavours added to obtain specific taste and characteristic sensorial features. Herbal vinegars consist of wine vinegars or white distilled vinegars, which may be seasoned with garlic, basil, tarragon, cinnamon, clove, or nutmeg. Fruit-flavoured vinegars are wine and white vinegars sweetened with fruit or fruit juice to produce a characteristic sweet-sour taste. Traditional vinegars are very expensive vinegar produced from regional foods according to well-established customs: balsamic vinegar of Modena from Italy; Sherry vinegar from Spain; Champagne vinegar from France etc. According to international definition of vinegar, in this book we considered only vinegar derived from a two stage fermentation process. However with many of the vinegars in Africa, Asia and Latin America, knowledge of the processes involved is poor and a comprehensive view of all different kinds of vinegars is impossible. Therefore {{it is likely that the}} worldspread vinegars give a very greater picture. Economy, technology and law about vinegar were described in this chapter...|$|R

40|$|Utah cattle ranchers realize {{relatively}} little profit from ranch ownership and management. This study represents {{an attempt to}} identify ranch management strategies that produce more profit over time than do conventional strategies. To identify optimum management strategies for the long term, analyses of ranches under both normal and adverse ranch operation conditions using the COPLAN linear programming model were made for strategy comparison. To depict these ranch business environmental conditions, production levels were estimated from available biological data and price levels were estimated by indexing 1977 ranch product prices (the most current budget data available for Utah). The variability of strategy expected net returns above variable costs over a defined array of ranch operation conditions was estimated to evaluate income stability for each strategy. Overall profitability comparisons were made among strategies for evaluation {{in the context of}} ranch ownership and management. Percent returns on owned ranch capital were estimated as the basis for this comparison. Optimum strategies based on various ranch operation conditions for a large Utah cattle ranch were similar, as were optimum strategies based on the same conditions for a small Utah cattle ranch. Availability of winter/spring forage should be the principal constraint limiting cow-herd size based on the analyses. Range improvement practices that reduce the winter/spring range forage bottleneck are economically feasible in general, however, such practices must be evaluated on a site-specific basis. Optimum strategies for both large and small ranches focused on: 1) intensively managed cow/yearling enterprises at herd levels corresponding to levels of available winter/spring forage, 2) intensively managed crop production enterprises based on sale of crops, and 3) yearling stocker steer enterprises based on <b>seasonal</b> forage <b>surplus.</b> The economic analyses showed that alternative (optimum) management strategies could increase profit over conventional strategies dramatically. Optimum strategies for the large ranch produced net returns above variable costs many times greater than those produced by the strategy employed in 1977. Expected net returns above variable costs that resulted from small ranch optimum strategies were vastly superior to those produced by the 1977 strategy. Working capital requirement increased approximately 50 percent over levels required by strategies employed in 1977 for both large and small ranch optimum strategies. Expected income variances and standard deviations were greater for both large and small ranch optimum strategies than for strategies practiced in 1977; however, income standard deviations expressed as percentages of strategy expected values (relative income variabilities) were much less. Percent returns on owned ranch capital expected from the practice of optimum strategies were eight times greater than percent returns from practice of the 1977 strategy for the large Utah cattle ranch and six times greater than those resulting from employment of the 1977 small ranch strategy...|$|R
