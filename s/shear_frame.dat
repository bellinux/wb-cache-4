40|$|ABSTRACT. The Avalanche Control Section at Rogers Pass is responible for {{avalanche}} {{safety on}} the Trans Canada Highway and Canadian Pacific Railroad within Glacier National Park {{and for the}} daily issue of an avalanche warning bulletin for backcountry users of the park. During the winter of 1995 - 96 a small research project made <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> tests of persistent weak layers at a study plot near tree line to study strength changes. The <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> data were also {{used to assess the}} snow stability in the surrounding terrain. Concurrently, at the same location, traditional mete-orological and snowpack observations were made to assess snow stability for operational use. The two methods of stability assessment are compared and related to the avalanche activity (natural and artificial) along the highway and in the adjacent backcountry for an active storm and ava-lanche period. At that time avalanche forecasting strongly depended on a buried surface hoar layer that showed some interesting behaviour. <b>Shear</b> <b>frame</b> measurements proved again to be an impor-tant parameter to assess snow stability. Exper ence in winter 1995 - 96 suggests that a combination of <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> measurements in study plots with stability tests on slopes is most efficient since it reveals (1) the temporal development of instabilities, and (2) the spatial distribution of instabilities and the reactivity on artificial triggering, strongly depending on slab properties. Key words: snow strength, <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> measurements, snow cover stability, avalanches, ava-lanche forecasting, avalanche contro...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{in a first}} part the advantages and draw-backs of the following tests: wedge test, shovel test, "Rutsch-block-"test, <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> test. The theoretical background and the pratical value of each test are discussed. Whereas the wedge and the shovel test require smaller shoveling effort than the others, they both are hampered by a bending mode of failure, which {{is not easy to}} compensate for. The "Rutschblock"-test, which simulates a basal shear failure by a skier, is shown to be a useful tool for practitioners as long as certain precautions are taken. The <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> test, which yields together with previous shovel or "Rutsch-block"-tests numerical indices for weak sublayers, is a delicate method, which is rather confined to special investigations. In a second part the paper deals with the representativity of such snowcover stability tests. Recent studies (e. g. Conway and Ab-rahamson, 1988) claim that a snow slope contains many irregular, small failure spots. Such irregularities wouid render any snowco-ver test illusory. In order to illuminate these aspects for Alpine conditions several measuring series (<b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> ar. d/or "Rutsch-block") along the peripheries of slabs and across extended slopes that had not avalanched are presented. Although stability varia-tions were found- mainly depending on aspect, underground, terrain geometry and sliding layer depth- the variations were explainable and by all means srEaller than the ones reported in previous work. Most of the apparent discrepancies may be explained by a different <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> procedure and/or by climatological reasons. There are several indications that for a slab release many small or a few large "deficit areas " are needed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: There {{is a lack}} of {{measurements}} on the rapidly changing mechanical and physical properties of non-persistent instabilities in storm snow. Given the importance of these weak layers in creating snowpack instabilities on which natural avalanches can release, {{there is a need to}} better understand and quantify the evolution of layer properties. After identifying unstable layers with a tilt-board test, we measured changes in layer shear strength over time with a <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> test. We performed up to 13 sets of 12 <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> test arrays for seven separate storm snow weak layers at the Mt. Fidelity study plot in the Columbia Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. This resulted in over 430 <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> tests, with sampling up to twice daily, in the winter of 2006. Snowpack properties, including overlying load, densities, temperature gradient and crystal types, of the weak layer and adjacent layers were measured, along with ambient weather conditions. Observations show higher density layers with smaller crystals above and below the weak layer, and weak layers tended to have a lower density and consist of large, precipitation particles. We measured an average rate of strengthening in non-persistent layer of 143 Pa/d. Results indicate a strong correlation between strengthening in weak layers and the stress induced by overlying load...|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} in situ direct {{shear test}} (DST) was developed for measuring the shear strength of soils in fields.

The latticed <b>shearing</b> <b>frame</b> is directly embedded in the ground to be tested after a construction process and is pulled with a flexible chain while a constant dead load is applied to the sample in the <b>shearing</b> <b>frame.</b> This simplified in situ DST has been validated by comparing its results with those of triaxial tests on samples with parallel gradations under normal stresses less than 100 kPa. In this study, the DST was further validated by carrying out tests on samples with the same gradations, rather than on samples with parallel gradations, under normal stresses up to 880 kPa.

40|$|AbstractA {{nonlinear}} hardening {{rule that}} describes a general yield surface change for frame members is proposed. The rule is valid for homogeneous materials and {{is defined by}} a nonlinear constitutive model. The model is given as the stress–strain relationship through the section thickness. The post-yield behavior of <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> members is assessed using a hardening index parameter, a plastic strain coefficient, and a smooth and optimal mathematical function to model the geometry of structural wide-flange and tube sections. This enables a continuous distribution of post-yield curvatures to exist along the member length and results in accurate finite-element member displacement predictions. Steady-state hysteresis responses are determined for frame sections using the model’s nonlinearly degrading stiffness. The hardening rule is used to model the detailed material behavior of <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> members that are subjected to lateral loads. The results of the model are validated through experimental published literature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> may {{be defined}} as a {{structure}} {{in which there is no}} rotation of a horizontal section at the level of the floor. In this respect the deflected frame will have many of the features of a cantilever beam that is deflected by shear forces, Hence the name <b>Shear</b> <b>frame</b> is given to those frames. To accomplish such deflection in frame, it is assume that: (1) the total mass of the structure is concentrated at the levels of the floors; (2) the beams on the floor are infinitely rigid as compared to the columns; and (3) the deformation of the structure is independent of the axial forces present in the columns. These assumptions transform the problem from a structure with an infinite number of degree of freedom (due to the distributed mass) to a structure which has only as many degrees as it has lumped masses at the floor levels. This paper is concerned with the response spectrum analysis of six stories <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> with six degrees of freedom i. e. six horizontal displacement at the floor levels. From the analysis it concluded that, the first mode shape is most important one, because 86. 96 %, of Mass will respond to ground motion, when only 8. 91 % of mass will respond in the second. Mode shape, also the only first-two mode shapes will be adequate to insure that more than 90 % of the mass will vibrate responding to ground motio...|$|E

Representation using shearlets recently receives a lot of attention due to their desirable properties in both theory and applications. Using the framework of frequency-based affine systems, in this paper we introduce and systematically study affine <b>shear</b> tight <b>frames</b> which include all known shearlet tight frames as special cases. Our results in this paper will resolve several key questions on shearlets. We provide a complete characterization for an affine <b>shear</b> tight <b>frame</b> and then use it to obtain smooth affine <b>shear</b> tight <b>frames</b> with all their generators in the Schwarz class. Though multiresolution analysis (MRA) is the foundation and key feature of wavelet analysis for fast numerical implementation of a wavelet transform, all the known shearlets so far do not possess any MRA structure and filter banks. In order to study affine <b>shear</b> tight <b>frames</b> with MRA structure, we introduce the notion of a sequence of affine <b>shear</b> tight <b>frames</b> and then we provide a complete characterization for it. Based on our characterizations, we present two different approaches, i. e., non-stationary and quasi-stationary, for the construction of sequences of affine <b>shear</b> tight <b>frames</b> with MRA structure such that all their generators are smooth (in the Schwarz class) and they have underlying filter banks. Consequently, their associated transforms can be efficiently implemented using filter banks similarly as a fast wavelet transform does...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{a method}} is {{developed}} to compute first-passage probabilities for linear elastic structures subjected to random base accelerations. The base accelerations consist of both {{horizontal and vertical}} components. Specifically, {{the effect of the}} vertical accelerations on the first passage probabilities are investigated herein. ^ The solution of the first-passage problem is accomplished by discretizing the process in both space and time. Spacial barriers are placed on the response process of the structure. The probabilities associated with the structural response remaining within the specified barriers are computed. This event is the complementary event of first passage. ^ For a single-story frame undergoing horizontal accelerations, the model of the frame is seen to {{have a significant effect on}} first passage probabilities. The models used are a <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> model and a flexible beam model. The effect of vertical accelerations is noticeable regardless of the model chosen. This effect is seen to depend more upon the magnitude of the frame loading than upon the magnitude of the vertical acceleration. ^ For a two-story frame, only a <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> model is used. First-passage probabilities are computed for arbitrary barriers on the displacement responses of the stories under the action of horizontal base accelerations only. Then the first-passage probabilities are computed for the same frame subjected to both vertical and horizontal accelerations. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Hard-to-forecast deep slab {{avalanches}} can release unpredictably under diverse conditions {{ranging from}} storms to clear days to locally induced stress to the snowpack. For {{the formation of}} many natural avalanches, a point is reached where the mass loading of overlying snow overpowers the mechanical properties of the weak layer. This can occur from additional loading above the weak layer, such as from precipitation or wind loading. Furthermore, natural failure can occur from solar warming and temperature variations. External stresses applied to the snowpack from skiers, snowmobilers, and other forces can also trigger deep slab avalanches. We collected field measurements of {{the properties of the}} failure layers and slab load to determine trends and correlations between such variables. The failure planes were analyzed using the deep tap test, propagation saw test, <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> tests, and hand hardness and the overlying loads were calculated using density measurements. Spatial variability across the crowns was also assessed by use of multiple profiles and tests. Deep tap tests consistently yielded sudden (Q 1) fractures and the cut length in the PST was usually less than 60 % of the column length when the fracture propagated to the end. Preliminary results on spatial variability indicate that DT and <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> results tended to increase with slab depth at some deep slab locations and crown thickness typically varied substantially. Locations with a thin snowpack, such as near rocky cliffs, were likely trigger points for some of the deep slab avalanches...|$|E

The mentioned transforms decompose the strong ground motion into low and high frequency parts. Since the high frequency portion of strong ground motion has a minor effect on dynamic response of structures, the structure is excited by low frequency part. Consequently, the seismic response of structure is predicted consuming one half of computational time, comparing with conventional time history analysis. Towards reducing the computational effort needed in seismic optimization of structure, seismic optimization of a <b>shear</b> <b>frame</b> structure is conducted by applying various forms of mentioned transformation through genetic algorithm...|$|E

This analytical model referred to as Analytical Model of wood <b>frame</b> <b>SHEar</b> walls subjected to Vertical load (AMSHEV) {{is based on the}} kinematic behavior of wood <b>frame</b> <b>shear</b> walls and captures significant characteristics observed from experimental testing through appropriate modeling of three failure mechanisms that can occur within a shear wall under static monotonic load: 1) failure of sheathing-to-framing connectors, 2) failure of vertical studs, and 3) uplift of end studs from bottom sill. Previous models have not accounted for these failure mechanisms as well as the inclusion of vertical load, which has shown to reveal beneficial effects such as increasing the ultimate load capacity and limiting uplift of the wall as noted in experimental tests.

The shear strength of the cable bolt was tested by both the BS 7861 single and UOW double shear methods.
