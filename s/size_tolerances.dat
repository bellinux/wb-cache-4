50|$|When {{designing}} mechanical components, {{a system}} of standardized tolerances called International Tolerance grades are often used. The standard (<b>size)</b> <b>tolerances</b> are divided into two categories: hole and shaft. They are labelled with a letter (capitals for holes and lowercase for shafts) and a number. For example: H7 (hole, tapped hole, or nut) and h7 (shaft or bolt). H7/h6 is a very common standard tolerance which gives a tight fit. The tolerances work {{in such a way}} that for a hole H7 means that the hole should be made slightly larger than the base dimension (in this case for an ISO fit 10+0.015−0, meaning that it may be up to 0.015 mm larger than the base dimension, and 0 mm smaller). The actual amount bigger/smaller depends on the base dimension. For a shaft of the same size h6 would mean 10+0-0.009, which means the shaft may be as small as 0.009 mm smaller than the base dimension and 0 mm larger. This method of standard tolerances is also known as Limits and Fits and can be found in ISO 286-1:2010 (Link to ISO catalog).|$|E

40|$|Realistic {{modeling}} of cost of manufacturing is essential both for estimating {{cost of a}} product and for optimizing alternate manufacturing strategies. Although there are many factors that affect cost of manufacturing, {{the single most important}} parameter for estimating the cost of manufacturing is tolerance (deviation from the nominal size). Since tolerance affects the manufacturing cost directly, in the past most cost formulations were constructed using some form of inverse power function of a single tolerance parameter. However, to meet stringent quality and functional requirements more parts are now being controlled with geometric tolerances on top of <b>size</b> <b>tolerances.</b> In these situations, {{it is very difficult to}} establish a single representative tolerance parameter that can be used for estimating cost of manufacturing. A more general formulation is needed to extend the cost functions to deviations of all features of a part and the mating relations between parts of an assembly so that the total effect of the prescribed geometric tolerances could be captured. In this paper, existing single parameter cost formulations have been reviewed and then a generic deviation-based cot of manufacturing formulation has been presented. The constraints and advantages of extending the cost functions to multi-dimensional formulations have also been briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Material loss at {{the taper}} {{junction}} of metal-on-metal total hip replacements (MOM THRs) has {{been implicated in}} their early failure. The mechanisms of material loss are not fully understood; analysis of the patterns of damage at the taper can help us better understand why material loss occurs at this junction. Methods: We mapped the patterns of material loss {{in a series of}} 155 MOM-THRs received at our centre by scanning the taper surface using a roundness-measuring machine. We examined these material loss maps to develop a five-tier classification system based on visual differences between different patterns. We correlated these patterns to surgical, implant and patient factors known to be important for head-stem taper damage. Results: We found that 63 implants had ‘minimal damage’ at the taper (material loss < 1 mm 3) and the remaining 92 implants could be categorised by four distinct patterns of taper material loss. We found that (1) head diameter and (2) time to revision were key significant variables separating the groups. Conclusion: These material loss maps allow us to suggest different mechanisms that dominate the cause of the material loss in each pattern: (a) corrosion, (b) mechanically assisted corrosion or (c) intra-operative damage or poor <b>size</b> <b>tolerances</b> leading to toggling of trunnion in taper...|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{criteria}} {{have been}} used successfully to design filters of most embankment large dam projects throughout the world. However, these empirical rules are only applicable to a particular range of soils tested in laboratory and do {{not take into account}} the variability of the base material and filter particle sizes. In addition, it is widely accepted that the safety of fill dams is mainly dependent on the reliability of their filter performance. The work herein presented consists in a new general method for assessing the probability of fulfilling any empirical filter design criteria accounting for base and filter heterogeneity by means of first-order reliability methods (FORM), so that reliability indexes and probabilities of fulfilling any particular criteria are obtained. This method will allow engineers to estimate the safety of existing filters in terms of probability of fulfilling their design criteria and might also be used as a decision tool on sampling needs and material <b>size</b> <b>tolerances</b> during construction. In addition, sensitivity analysis makes possible to analyse how reliabilities are influenced by different sources of input data. Finally, in case of a portfolio risk assessment, this method will allow engineers to compare the safety of several existing dams in order to prioritize safety investments and it is expected to be a very useful tool to evaluate probabilities of failure due to internal erosion.

40|$|An {{economic}} simulation is used {{to analyze}} the powder injection molding (PIM) process. The five layer analysis has been verified and provides a consistent means to determine the key drives on component cost, including consideration of tooling, material (powder), component features, economic batch size, and production steps. The model is accurate within 10 %. Benchmark parts are used to assess the sensitivity to several factors ranging from complexity, <b>size,</b> <b>tolerances,</b> shape, feature combinations, materials, batch size, and various debinding and sintering technologies. Components from stainless steel at 1, 10 and 100 g mass are used to illustrate the interplay between the adjustable parameters with respect to production cost. The simulation helps the designer understand the sensitivity to various features and to anticipate design options to minimize PIM production costs. Each design differs, but these calculations some typical PIM components. Two approaches are used to show relative contributions to price via pie charts and to show price sensitivities. Analysis of price sensitivity derives from differentiation of the fabrication cost with respect to design criteria- material, mass, complexity, tolerances, and such. The sensitivity analysis ranks case-specific factors such as process yield, labor cost, and furnace loading. For a typical PIM case (8 g stainless steel component with maximum dimension of 25 mm produced at 1 million parts per year via thermal debinding and batch sintering), this analysis shows the lowest cost comes from self-mixing, coring to reduce mass, improved process yields, water atomized powder, and high furnace loading.

40|$|Studies of spherical nanoengineered drug {{delivery}} systems {{have suggested that}} particle size and mechanical properties are key determinants of in vivo behavior; however, for more complex structures, detailed analysis of correlations between in vitro characterization and in vivo disposition is lacking. Anisotropic materials in particular bear unknowns in terms of <b>size</b> <b>tolerances</b> for in vivo clearance {{and the impact of}} shape and rigidity. Herein, we employed cylindrical polymer brushes (CPBs) to answer questions related to the impact of size, length and rigidity on the in vivo behavior of PEGylated anisotropic structures, in particular their pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. The modular grafting assembly of CPBs allowed for the systematic tailoring of parameters such as aspect ratio or rigidity while keeping the overall chemical composition the same. CPBs with altered length were produced from polyinitiator backbones with different degrees of polymerization. The side chain grafts consisted of a random copolymer of poly[(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (PEGMA) and poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA), and rendered the CPBs water-soluble. The epoxy groups of PGMA were subsequently reacted with propargylamine to introduce alkyne groups, which in turn were used to attach radiolabels via copper(I) -catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC). Radiolabeling allowed the pharmacokinetics of intravenously injected CPBs to be followed as well as their deposition into major organs post dosing to rats. To alter the rigidity of the CPBs, core-shell-structured CPBs with polycaprolactone (PCL) as a water-insoluble and crystalline core and PEGMA-co-PGMA as the hydrophilic shell were synthesized. This modular buildup of CPBs allowed their shape and rigidity to be altered, which in turn could be used to influence the in vivo circulation behavior of these anisotropic polymer particles. Increasing the aspect ratio or altering the rigidity of the CPBs led to reduced exposure, higher clearance rates, and increased mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) organ deposition...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) for the repair and retrofit of concrete structures in the 1980 ’s, considerable research {{has been devoted to}} the feasibility of their application and predictive modeling of their performance. However, the effects of flaws present in the constitutive components and the practices in substrate preparation and treatment have not yet been thoroughly studied. ^ This research aims at investigating the effect of surface preparation and treatment for the pre-cured FRP systems and the groove <b>size</b> <b>tolerance</b> for near surface mounted (NSM) FRP systems; and to set thresholds for guaranteed system performance. This study was conducted as part of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 10 - 59 B to develop construction specifications and process control manual for repair and retrofit of concrete structures using bonded FRP systems. ^ The research included both analytical and experimental components. The experimental program for the pre-cured FRP systems consisted of a total of twenty-four (24) reinforced concrete (RC) T-beams with various surface preparation parameters and surface flaws, including roughness, flatness, voids and cracks (cuts). For the NSM FRP systems, a total of twelve (12) additional RC T-beams were tested with different grooves sizes for FRP bars and strips. The analytical program included developing an elaborate nonlinear finite element model using the general purpose software ANSYS. The bond interface between FRP and concrete was modeled by a series of nonlinear springs. The model was validated against test data from the present study as well as those available from the literature. The model was subsequently used to extend the experimental range of parameters for surface flatness in pre-cured FRP systems and for groove size study in the NSM FRP systems. ^ Test results, confirmed by further analyses, indicated that contrary to the general belief in the industry, the impact of surface roughness on the global performance of pre-cured FRP systems was negligible. The study also verified that threshold limits set for wet lay-up FRP systems can be extended to pre-cured systems. The study showed that larger surface voids and cracks (cuts) can adversely impact both the strength and ductility of pre-cured FRP systems. On the other hand, frequency (or spacing) of surface cracks (cuts) may only affect system ductility rather than its strength. Finally, within the range studied, groove <b>size</b> <b>tolerance</b> of ± 1 / 8 in. {{does not appear to have}} an adverse effect on the performance of NSM FRP systems. ...|$|R
