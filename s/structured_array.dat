Variations in the metamaterial particle characteristics or array assembly result in undesirable broadening of the effective material response. When lumped circuit elements are used in metamaterial particles, this effect can be significant due to element variability.

Generation of all arrays with a given structure up to some given length has many applications, including bounded exhaustive testing. A sequential generator of structured arrays can be defined by two C functions: the first one computes an initial array, and the second one steps from one array {{to the next one}} according to some total order on the set of arrays. We formally specify with ACSL annotations that the generated arrays satisfy the prescribed structural constraints (soundness property) and that the generation is in increasing lexicographic order (progress property). We refine this specification into two programming and specification patterns: one for generation in lexicographic order and one for generation by filtering the output of another generator. We distribute a library of generators instantiating these patterns. After adding suitable loop invariants we automatically prove the soundness and progress properties with the Frama-C platform...|$|E

This method of design recognizes two distinct environments for circuits, the local environment and the global environment and further recognizes that the assumptions regarding the temporal characteristics of the system that may be valid in the local environment may not be valid in the global environment. This paper shows how self timed circuits can be systematically designed on a single chip using assumptions reasonable for components on a single chip. This paper is based on our work on Structured Logic Arrays (SLAs) and first explains the intricacies of the temporal constraints implemented in the <b>structured</b> <b>array</b> and then shows how one can take advantage of these constraints in the design of self timed circuits. In this structure, for example, it is possible to design an asynchronous sequential state machine with non adjacent transitions without getting into hazardous conditions.

Such a surface (iSurface) {{can be considered}} an amorphous computer composed of a large array of identical processing units (iCells) {{each with its own}} sensor/effectors. Whilst nano-sized particles interconnecting in an ad hoc way may just be a dream, there are more practical approaches that could have short term applications in intelligent environments. One such approach is a <b>structured</b> <b>array</b> of iCells constructed at more modest scales perhaps making use of new printing methods onto paper. An important requirement of such a surface is the need for a fast, reliable method to determine iCell operation, performance and code integrity. This paper describes a method to create long (>= 32 bit) stable, robust metrics using a profiling technique that represents the current operational state of an iCell and thus enabling the quick exchange of diagnostics between iCells along with data traffic. This paper looks at how stable diagnostic metrics and in particular a metric of code integrity can be created even when external events affect program flow within the iCell. Key requirements in the development of this system were fast acquisition of diagnostic variables, minimal affect on normal operation and the possibility of a hardware implementation which could be completely non intrusive in operation. The described method can create several types of metrics, allowing quick determination of for example, code validation, abnormal operation and unusual behavior.
