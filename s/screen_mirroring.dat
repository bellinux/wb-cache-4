Other features include {{front and rear}} cameras, a three-axis gyroscope, headset controls, proximity and ambient light sensors, microphone, magnetometer, accelerometer and a 9.7inch multi-touch screen with a maximum resolution of 1024×768 hence resulting in 132 ppi. The iPad 2 has four physical switches, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the home screen, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep, volume up/down, and a third switch for either screen rotation lock or mute. The home button on the iPad 2 is [...] "easier to double tap" [...] than the previous generation of the iPad. Apple reduced {{the size of the}} iPad by eliminating the stamped sheet metal frame from the display, integrating new thinner glass technology for the touch screen overlay, and slightly reducing the space between the display and battery. The iPad 2's screen is thinner, lighter, and yet stronger than the original iPad's.

500|$|Fellini scholar Thomas Van Order {{has pointed}} out that Fellini is equally free in the {{treatment}} of ambient sound in his films, preferring to cultivate what Chion has called, [...] "a subjective sense of point of audition", in which what is heard on <b>screen</b> <b>mirrors</b> a particular character's perceptions, as opposed to the visible reality of the scene. [...] As an example, ducks and chickens appear on the screen throughout Gelsomina's conversation with the nun, but, reflecting the girl's growing sense of enlightenment concerning her place in the world, the quacking and clucking of barnyard fowl dissolves into the chirping of songbirds.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the generic news bulletins, other programmes with specific audiences were launched such as GMT, The Hub and World News Today which broadcast news live but to a different audience. The programmes all had distinct opening titles featuring the BBC World News box logo in the bottom left of the <b>screen,</b> <b>mirroring</b> the main titles for the bulletins. While these live programmes were on air, a box containing the programme name in bold white and a background based from the programmes' opening titles, was placed above the BBC World News logo in the aston design. Also, the usual astons for headlines and information were suspended with breaking news appearing in the ticker only. [...] Promotions for the channel usually consisted of the BBC World News logo located in the bottom right of the screen throughout. Break fillers retained the existing design with a few modifications; the unique background image was moved from the very background to inside the boxes with the information and was replaced in the screen background by a white and light grey version of the pulsating rings globe. The BBC World News box logo is also present in the bottom right of the screen throughout.

5000|$|The fifth {{generation}} iPod Touch features iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. The {{user interface}} of iOS {{is based on}} the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions {{within the context of the}} iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode). Initially shipped with iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012, it can play music, movies, television shows, eBooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. This feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. However, the earpods that comes with the iPod does not include a remote and mic. The Voice Control feature can also be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist. Like the iPhone 4S and later models, the fifth generation iPod Touch was the first in the iPod Touch line-up to include Siri, that allows the user to operate the device by spoken commands. The software was improved in iOS 6 to include the ability to make restaurant reservations, launch apps, dictate Facebook or Twitter updates, retrieve movie reviews and detailed sports statistics. Typing can be aided by the voice assistant, which converts speech to text, and also supports iMessage, a specialised instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple devices running iOS 5 or later. Some newer applications and features that came with iOS 6 included Apple Maps, Passbook and <b>screen</b> <b>mirroring.</b> Apple Maps which replaced the former map application (powered by Google Maps) lacks many features present in competing maps apps and is also known to give wrong directions to users which still not fixed after the iOS 7 updates. The new Apple Maps app uses Apple's new vector-based engine that eliminates lag, making for smoother zooming. New to Maps is turn-by-turn navigation spoken directions, 3D views in some major cities and real-time traffic. The new Passbook app is able to retrieve documents such as boarding passes, admission tickets, coupons and loyalty cards. An iOS device with Passbook can be scanned under a reader to process a mobile payment at locations that have compatible hardware. AirPlay was made available, which allows <b>screen</b> <b>mirroring</b> through an Apple TV or other supported external device allows the screen of the iPod Touch to be mirrored, and was the first generation of the iPod Touch to support it.|$|E
40|$|<b>Screen</b> <b>mirroring</b> {{has been}} {{available}} to consumers for some time, however if every mobile device in the room supports <b>screen</b> <b>mirroring</b> to the main display (e. g. a shared TV), this necessitates a mechanism for managing its use. As such, this paper investigates allowing users in small intimacy groups (friends, family etc.) to self-manage mirrored use of the display, through passing/taking/requesting the display from whomever is currently mirroring to it. We examine the collaborative benefits this scheme could provide for the home, compared to existing multi-device use and existing <b>screen</b> <b>mirroring</b> implementations. Results indicate shared <b>screen</b> <b>mirroring</b> improves perceived collaboration, decreases dominance, preserves independence and has {{a positive effect on}} a group's activity awareness...|$|E
40|$|At {{the time}} of its release in 2007, Carlos Saura’s Fados was {{presented}} as the third in a trilogy of films about modern urban musics, following Flamenco (1995) and Tango (1998). Like those films, Fados is dedicated to a particular genre – the Portuguese music of the film’s title – and presented as a series of performances. Stylistically it is closer to Flamenco in that it dispenses with plot, narrative and characters (still important in Tango), opting instead to proceed via staged performances involving singers, instrumentalists and dancers. Like the earlier films the main ‘action’ is shot on a large sound stage which has been fitted with an assembly of partitions, <b>screens,</b> <b>mirrors</b> and theatre props to create a distinct space for each performance and to allow the interaction of live and pre-recorded material, the latter delivered via projection, still photography and recorded sound...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhile <b>screen</b> <b>mirroring</b> is an {{integral}} part of many video mediated collaborations, current systems are limited in their ability to include ad hoc <b>screen</b> <b>mirroring</b> from personal devices of collocated participants on each end of a video call. In this paper we introduce a system that addresses this limitation by enabling lightweight multi-user wireless smartphone mirroring within a video call. The system enables multiple smartphones to share both digital content as well as physical artefacts when mirroring the live view from the smartphone camera feed. We present a study of the system in use for a distributed design task. The findings explore how shared access to <b>screen</b> <b>mirroring</b> facilitates a fluid switching of floor control in the meeting and smooth interleaving of individual, sub group and full group shared activities. Further, the findings highlight the importance of smartphone mobility in enabling access to <b>screen</b> <b>mirroring</b> from the sites of individual work and sites of various physical artefacts and the significance of this for the dynamics of a video mediated collaboration...|$|E
