The strength of these alloys is modified and enhanced by different <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of these alloys and their composites have been extensively studied {{during the past}} decades. Important <b>mechanisms</b> applied to <b>strengthening</b> the alloys include precipitation strengthening, solution strengthening, grain and subgrain strengthening, and dislocation density strengthening.

5000|$|Although {{sometimes}} dynamic {{strain aging}} is used interchangeably with the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect (or serrated yielding), dynamic strain aging refers {{specifically to the}} microscopic mechanism that induces the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect. This <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism</b> is related to solid-solution strengthening and has been observed {{in a variety of}} fcc and bcc substitutional and interstitial alloys, metalloids like silicon, and ordered intermetallics within specific ranges of temperature and strain rate.|$|E
50|$|For this <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism,</b> solute {{atoms of}} one element {{are added to}} another, {{resulting}} in either substitutional or interstitial point defects in the crystal (see Figure 1). The solute atoms cause lattice distortions that impede dislocation motion, increasing the yield stress of the material. Solute atoms have stress fields around them which can interact with those of dislocations. The presence of solute atoms impart compressive or tensile stresses to the lattice, depending on solute size, which interfere with nearby dislocations, causing the solute atoms to act as potential barriers.|$|E
5000|$|Martensite {{is formed}} in carbon steels by the rapid cooling (quenching) of the {{austenite}} form of iron {{at such a}} high rate that carbon atoms do {{not have time to}} diffuse out of the crystal structure in large enough quantities to form cementite (Fe3C). Austenite is γ-Fe, (gamma-phase iron), a solid solution of iron and alloying elements. As a result of the quenching, the face-centered cubic austenite transforms to a highly strained body-centered tetragonal form called martensite that is supersaturated with carbon. The shear deformations that result produce a large number of dislocations, which is a primary <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism</b> of steels. The highest hardness of a pearlitic steel is 400 Brinell whereas martensite can achieve 700 Brinell.|$|E

An experimental study of the influence of the thermomechanical history on the microstructure and dislocation substructure was performed using two different grades of HSLA steels. As a result, {{a modified version of the}} Khan–Huang–Liang flow stress model (KHL) was developed and is discussed in the light of results from the present study.

5000|$|Increasing the {{bulkiness}} of the {{monomer unit}} via incorporation of aryl rings is another <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The anisotropy of the molecular structure means that these mechanisms are {{heavily dependent on}} the direction of applied stress. While aryl rings drastically increase rigidity along {{the direction of the}} chain, these materials may still be brittle in perpendicular directions. Macroscopic structure can be adjusted to compensate for this anisotropy. For example, the high strength of Kevlar arises from a stacked multilayer macrostructure where aromatic polymer layers are rotated with respect to their neighbors. When loaded oblique to the chain direction, ductile polymers with flexible linkages, such as oriented polyethylene, are highly prone to shear band formation, so macroscopic structures which place the load parallel to the draw direction would increase strength.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{material}} groups (classes) {{there is}} a further subdivision {{that depends on the}} relation between strength and toughness between different material subgroups. The ovals, or [...] "balloons" [...] within each material class tend to have a sloping trend that describes the subgroup's strength-toughness relationship. For example, take the alloy system's downward sloping trend. This relationship indicates, that within an alloy class an increase in strength leads to a decrease in fracture toughness regardless of the <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism</b> used. For this reason, it is beneficial to think of an increase in strength (within the engineering alloys) as a direct decrease in fracture toughness, which is correlated with a lower ductility of the material. This however, is not the trend for other material classes. As a first example, consider the polymer foams and porous ceramics. In direct contrast to alloys, the trend in this material class is to have an upward slope. Explicitly, when the strength of these materials is increased we can expect to see an accompanied increase in fracture toughness. Indeed, in the subgroup of basal and ash we observe a close to one order of magnitude increase in both properties. Porous ceramics have been shown to behave exactly like this under both compression stress and tensile stress, however, the fracture toughness values are ten times lower under tension. This behavior can most easily be grasped by considering the porosity of these materials, where these voids can be modeled as preexisting cracks, which increase the nucleation energy of cracks under stress and impede the propagation of these cracks. Note that the engineering ceramics also show the same sloping trend as the porous ceramics, however, the slope is much greater, which makes it less noticeable in the log-scale.|$|E

30|$|The alloys {{investigated}} exhibit exceedingly different evolutions in residual properties. This {{is expected}} as the residual mechanical behavior {{is governed by}} the relative state and evolution of the microstructural <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> which are discussed in detail by (Summers 2014). The primary evolving <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are the grain structure in 5083 -H 116 and precipitates in 6061 -T 651. These mechanisms are developed during material processing, i.e., strain hardening (5083) and precipitation hardening (6061), to a state resulting in the desired mechanical properties. Further evolution of these mechanisms at elevated temperatures governs residual mechanical behavior.|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{operative}} <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in low carbon martensitic steels {{that depend on}} the alloy and prior processing conditions. It is very challenging to deconvolute these <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> because lath martensite is a complicated, multiscale microstructure. In an effort to identify prominent <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in low carbon lath martensite, an Nb-microalloyed low carbon steel was subjected to different austenite conditioning and postquench tempering treatments. Austenite conditioning was performed to generate different prior austenite grain sizes and to thermomechanically process austenite below its recrystallization temperature. After processing, {{the strength of the}} as-quenched or as-quenched and tempered martensite was assessed through tensile or hardness experiments at room temperature. The results were correlated to measurements of dislocation density in the martensite, martensite microstructure including martensite block and packet size measured using electron backscatter diffraction imaging, and precipitation strengthening. For the processing conditions that were selected, strength was predominantly controlled by martensite dislocation density, which can be altered by reducing the prior austenite grain size and thermomechanical processing. The tempering response of the alloy was also sensitive to prior austenite grain size...|$|R

This contribution reports of a structural investigation on a eutectic AlSi 12 CuNiMg alloy before and after fatigue testing at high temperatures (up to 350 °C).

3000|$|... 6061 yield {{strength}} reduction initiates at about 250 – 300 °C (Figure  20 b) {{which is also}} about when the hardening rate (dσ/dε) begins to change (Figure  19 b). These temperatures are associated with precipitate growth from the β″ to β′ phase (Simar et al. 2008). This is indicative of a transition in the governing <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism,</b> i.e., precipitate-dislocation interaction. This transition may be elucidated using the hardening rate and {{yield strength}} evolution. Below 250 °C, dσ/dε remains low (< 1000  MPa), as is associated with small precipitate dislocation shearing (Dieter 1976). The residual yield strength is also relatively unchanged from the as-received value. The <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism</b> transition is discernible after exposure to 300 °C at 20 °C/min, which reduces residual yield strength by 90  MPa. The hardening rate also increases to ~ 1600  MPa at the initiation of plastic flow. This indicates that both strengthening mechanisms are likely active in the alloy due to a precipitate size distribution (Simar et al. 2007). Further increasing temperature results in {{a significant increase in}} initial hardening rate (> 3000  MPa). This is accompanied by a significant reduction in residual yield strength. This indicates large precipitates are {{a large proportion of the}} remaining precipitate distribution; the governing <b>strengthening</b> <b>mechanism</b> is thus predominantly Orowan looping (Dieter 1976).|$|E
