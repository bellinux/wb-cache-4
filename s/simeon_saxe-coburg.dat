50|$|The {{elections}} were decisively won by Boyko Borisov's GERB party, which gained 39.72% of the proportional vote and 26 of the 31 majority vote parliament seats, in total - 117 and {{almost half of}} the Assembly's 240 seats. Until the elections Boyko Borisov was Mayor of Sofia and left office to become Prime Minister, until 2005 {{he was a member of}} the former king Simeon II's NDSV party and before he was also a member of the Communist Party, though he and his party's policy are opposite to the Communist. The ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party-headed Coalition for Bulgaria gathered 17.70% but no majority vote seats. The Muslim minority's party Movement for Rights and Freedoms amassed 14.45% and won the remaining five majority vote seats, the nationalist party Attack came fourth with 9.36% of the proportional vote, followed by the right-wing Blue Coalition of former ruling elements with 6.76% and the newly Order, Law and Justice, whose tally was at 4.13%. Parties such as LIDER and <b>Simeon</b> <b>Saxe-Coburg</b> Gotha's once -ruling NDSV did not cross the 4% threshold and won no seats. The voter turnout of 60.20% was perceived as high, but was not unexpected.|$|E
