30|$|This {{terminal}} structure {{makes it}} relatively inefficient to transfer containers from intermodal <b>terminals</b> to the <b>shunting</b> yard. Each <b>terminal</b> uses Swiss split {{only for a}} few containers per day so that the trains to the shunting yard are quite short. In addition, the distances from the different terminals to the next shunting yard are quite long—sometimes up to 40  km. That makes the transfer of containers within the SWL network quite expensive and in result the terminals are served only once a day. Due to this inefficient use of container wagons, transport times and costs for Swiss Split are increased.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} an experimental electromechanical device for vibration control and energy harvesting. Traditionally, when the broadband resonant response due to a selected mode of a lightly damped structure needs to be controlled a vibration absorber is used. The resonance frequency of the absorber can be chosen to minimise {{the response of the}} structure under control. Optimising the damping ratio to achieve this aim also dissipates the most power in the damper, but care must be taken not to exceed the maximum throw of the device at high excitation levels. The absorber may also be mistuned by changes in operation condition and thus underperform. It is thus important to be able to design tuneable vibration absorbers, able to adapt their resonance frequency and their damping ratio depending on the operation condition. In this paper an electromechanical device consisting of a pendulum connected to an electrical motor is proposed. It is shown that by <b>shunting</b> the <b>terminal</b> of the device with an appropriate electrical circuit it is possible to control both its resonance frequency and its damping ratio. The power dissipated in the resistive part of the shunt circuit could also be harvested and used to implement the tuning mechanism, or for other purposes...|$|R

40|$|The ZR 431 is an {{enhanced}} {{version of the}} industry standard 431. It is a three <b>terminal</b> <b>shunt</b> regulator giving excellent temperature stability and the capability of operating at currents from 50 µA up to 100 mA. Its output voltage can be set to any voltage {{in the range of}} Vref (2. 5 V) to 20 V by the addition of two external divider resistors. The reference input current is typically only 100 nA, so high value resistors can be used without error. Its minimum operating current and reference input current are ten times lower than industry standard 431 parts. (Please refer to Appendix A) Fol lowing are a few example applications of the ZR 431 which show how the parts can be used. Shunt Regulator The ZR 431 is ideal for providing low voltage stabi l ised suppl ies or references. Simple low output voltage supplies can be difficult to build as the components normally used, such as zener diodes or band gap references, are either too poor in performance or not avai lab le at the desired vol tage (band-gap devices are usually fixed at 2. 5 V or 5 V with no intermediate values). The circuit in Figure 1 shows a 3 V shunt regulator utilising the ZR 431. The output of this supply can be set to any voltage in the range 2. 5 V to 20 V by adjusting the ratio of R 1 and R 2, following the relationship:...|$|R
40|$|Diesel {{locomotives}} provide versatility to {{the railway}} system {{as they do}} not depend on electric feeding. Worldwide they constitute important parts of locomotive fleets used for various tasks such as mainline services, <b>shunting</b> and <b>terminal</b> operations. The main drawbacks are emissions of CO 2, NOx and other pollutants. The emissions to air are in general controlled by legislation. The European testing and approval procedure for locomotive engines is performed with the ISO 8178 -F test cycle. It is alone meant to resemble all European locomotives. Good correlation was found between mainline operations and the ISO 8178 -F test cycle. A good correlation was furthermore found between shunting operations and North American shunting test cycles. However, this thesis has shown that this results in inadequate description of for instance shunting operations. Typical characteristics for shunting are relatively high ratio of transient loading, low mean power output and high amount of idling. Therefore important aspects of diesel locomotive usage are thereby disregarded in certifications. Deficient correlation between test cycle and intended operations may lead to locomotives that are not properly optimised {{for the type of}} operation they are intended for. Improperly dimensioned and optimised locomotives cause impaired fuel economy and more emissions emitted. Many Swedish diesel locomotives are to a large extent used in shunting-like conditions in yards and industries for instance. Therefore, it is recommended to supplement the present ISO test cycle with a test cycle that includes the characteristic of shunting. Knowledge about duty cycles for specific operations can be of importance in locomotive acquisition, dimensioning of new locomotives or when estimating emissions and/or fuel consumption. It is essential to make proper dimensioning of propulsion systems as it can imply lower life cycle costs as well as fewer emissions. Appropriate dimensioning of the propulsion system is particularly important for non-conventional propulsion systems. If the application range of a test cycle is narrow, its emulating capability ought to be better at describing and representing the indented application. Today's test cycles state fractional power or torque as a function of engine speed. This may result in misleading duty cycles when the same kind of operation is undertaken with different locomotives that have widespread power ratings. A more powerful locomotive used for the very same load as a less powerful locomotive will result in a different duty cycle. Non-conventional propulsion systems are gaining popularity also in the railway industry where implementation of new technology usually is slow. Dual mode and hybrid systems are two examples. Related to test and duty cycles the build-up of these new propulsion systems change the prerequisites of the propulsion systems. From a duty cycle perspective it is reasonable to implement an additional test cycle for non-conventional propulsion systems if the popularity rises. QC 2011111...|$|R
40|$|As doenças colestáticas e sua evolução para fibrose e cirrose são muito conhecidas. Apesar do incremento de terapias, como o transplante hepático, esse grupo de afecções, ainda representa desafio na prática médica, desde o diagnóstico até o tratamento, além de estarem ligadas a morbidade e letalidade altas, com custos de tratamento elevados. Novas condutas e busca dos mecanismos fisiopatológicos envolvidos são ampliados a cada dia. Este trabalho tem por objetivos avaliar a influência e os efeitos da exclusão parcial e total do íleo {{terminal}} em fígado, rins e íleo, na presença de colestase obstrutiva. Foram utilizados trinta e dois ratos Wistar machos, distribuídos em quatro grupos (n = 8). Os grupos 2, 3 e 4 foram submetidos a ligadura do ducto hepático comum e, após quatro semanas, realizou-se drenagem biliar interna, por meio de hepaticoduodenostomia, com uso de prótese de nelaton. Nos animais do Grupo 3 associou-se anastomose ileocólica laterolateral com exclusão parcial dos últimos dez centímetros do íleo terminal. Nos animais do Grupo 4 realizou-se a secção e fechamento dos dez centímetros distais do íleo terminal e foi feita anastomose terminolateral, do íleo com cólon ascendente. O Grupo 1 foi controle, no qual os ratos foram submetidos, apenas a laparotomia e laparorrafia. Ao fim de oito semanas, todos os ratos dos quatro grupos foram mortos e foi colhido material para exames. Os exames bioquímicos foram: albumina, aspartatoaminotransferase, alaninaaminotransferase, fosfatase alcalina, ã-glutamiltransferase, bilirrubina direta, bilirrubina indireta, ureia e creatinina. Foram colhidos ainda, fígado, rins e segmento de íleo terminal, para análise anatomopatológica. Os resultados foram submetidos a análise estatística pelos testes de ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson e Fisher. Houve persistência de graus variáveis de fibrose nos ratos do grupo 2, 3 e 4, sem diferença entre si. O grupo controle não apresentou fibrose hepática. Na histologia renal e do íleo terminal não foram vistas diferenças entre os quatro grupos. Em relação à análise bioquímica, os valores de AST, ALT, bilirrubina direta, ã-glutamiltransferase, ureia e creatinina foram maiores no Grupo 4 em relação ao controle (p < 0, 05). O Grupo 4 apresentou valores de ureia e creatinina superiores aos dos grupos 2 e 3 (p < 0, 05). Conclui-se que derivação parcial do íleo terminal e a exclusão total dos últimos centímetros do íleo terminal, associadas à drenagem biliar não apresentaram diferenças na intensidade da fibrose hepática, comparadas à drenagem biliar isolada, em ratos submetidos a ligadura prévia do ducto hepático comum. A exclusão do íleo terminal, em modelo de ligadura do ducto hepático associou-se a piora das provas bioquímicas do fígado. Não houve benefício na derivação ileocólica nas alterações morfológicas e na função do fígado e dos rins. A exclusão total do íleo terminal, associada a derivação biliodigestiva pós-colestase, piorou os valores das provas bioquímicas renais. Cholestatic {{diseases and}} their evolution into fibrosis and cirrhosis are wellknown. Despite {{the increase in}} therapies, such as liver transplants, this group of affections still represents a challenge in medical practices, from the diagnosis to the treatment, and is commonly linked to high rates of morbidity and lethality, coupled with high treatment costs. New conducts {{and the search for}} the physiopathological mechanisms involved are constantly emerging. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the influence and effect of the partial or total exclusion of the terminal ileum in the liver, kidney, and ileum, in presence of obstructive cholestasis. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n = 8). Groups 2, 3, and 4 underwent the ligation of the common hepatic duct. After four weeks, an internal biliary drainage was performed by means of hepaticoduodenostomy, using a nelaton prosthesis. In the animals from Group 3, a laterolateral ileocolic anastomosis, with a partial exclusion of the final 10 centimeters of the terminal ileum, could be observed. In the animals from Group 4, the sectioning and closing of 10 distal centimeters of the terminal ileum, as well as a terminolateral anastomosis of the ileum with ascending colon, were performed. Group 1 was the control group, in which the rats were undertaken to only laparotomy and laparorrhaphy. At the end of eight weeks, all the rats from the four groups were killed and material was collected for exams. The biochemical exams included: albumin, aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), alanine-aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, ã-glutamiltransferase, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, urea, and creatinine. The liver, kidneys, and a segment of the terminal ileum were also collected for anatomopathological analyses. The results were submitted to statistical analyses by means of the ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson, and Fisher exact tests. Persistence in the varying degrees of fibrosis could be observed in the rats from groups 2, 3, and 4, with no significant difference amongst these groups. The control group did not present hepatic fibrosis. In the histology of the kidney and the terminal ileum, no differences could be identified among the four groups. Concerning the biochemical analyses, the values of AST, ALT, direct bilirubin, ã-glutamiltransferase, urea, and creatinine were greater in Group 4 as compared to the control group (p < 0. 05). Group 4 presented urea and creatinine values that were higher than those from groups 2 and 3 (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, in male Wistar rats, the ileocolic partial <b>shunt</b> of the <b>terminal</b> ileum and the total exclusion of the final centimeters of the terminal ileum after internal biliary drainage of the extra-hepatic cholestasis did not alter the intensity of hepatic fibrosis. These procedures did not modify the morphology of the kidney or the terminal ileum. The total exclusion of the terminal ileum worsened the biochemical samples from the liver and kidney. No benefit in the ileocolic shunt in either the morphology or function of the liver and kidneys could be observed. The total exclusion of the terminal ileum after biliary drainage for obstructive cholestasis worsened renal biochemical samples...|$|R
