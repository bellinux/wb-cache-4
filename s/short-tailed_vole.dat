50|$|In {{areas such}} as Great Britain, where the only other small vole is the <b>short-tailed</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus agrestis), the bank vole is {{distinguished}} by its more prominent ears, chestnut-brown fur and longer tail which is usually 50% body length. The northern red-backed vole (Myodes rutilus) from northern Scandinavia and Russia, has a shorter tail and is paler with less grey in its pelage. The grey red-backed vole (Myodes rufocanus) from northern Eurasia, is larger with a distinctive reddish back.|$|E
50|$|The meadows {{are home}} to <b>short-tailed</b> <b>vole,</b> with the Bur Dyke home for water voles, rabbits, fox, weasel, common shrew, hedgehog, bank vole, wood mouse and roe deer have been seen on the site. Bats {{can also be seen}} over the meadows. Suitable {{breeding}} habitats for the common frog and smooth newt are provided by seasonal ponds. The Bur Dyke supports a population of three-spined stickleback. Birds that frequent the area include blackbird, blue tit, great tit, wren, dunnock, robin, common chaffinch, bullfinch, blackcap, whitethroat, willow warbler, fieldfare, redwing, heron, kingfisher and chiffchaff. A recent survey identified 22 species of butterfly on the site, including speckled wood, holly blue, small copper, brown argus and marbled white.|$|E

5000|$|The {{field vole}} or <b>short-tailed</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus agrestis) is a grey-brown vole, around four inches (ten centimetres) in length, {{with a short}} tail. It {{is one of the}} most common mammals in Europe, with a range {{extending}} from the Atlantic coast to Lake Baikal. These voles are found in moist grassy habitats, such as woodland, marsh or on river banks. Although they make shallow burrows, they usually build nests above ground. They are an important food source for owls and some other predators and their population size tends to peak and trough cyclically. Field voles breed prolifically, mainly in summer, but often all year round, even under snow. Females produce up to seven litters a year, each averaging from four to six young which are weaned after about fourteen days. The field vole is both widespread and common and is listed as being of [...] "Least Concern" [...] by the IUCN.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In 19891991, {{the feeding}} ecology of Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) was studied in Wigry National Park (NE Poland). Diet {{composition}} was investigated by analysis of pellets gathered in stands under roost trees or nest boxes from April to August in 35 home ranges each year. In {{order to assess}} potential prey, small animals were caught in 28 traps. Small mammals composed 66. 5 % of prey items and 78. 9 % of food biomass of Tawny Owl, birds 8. 1 % and 13. 9 %, and frogs 17. 4 % and 6. 8 % of prey and biomass, respectively. The diet was dominated by rodents, mainly bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) and common vole (Microtus arvalis), which together composed 37. 0 % of prey items and 37. 2 % of the biomass consumed. Among birds, the most common prey was Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos). Slightly preferred prey were field mouse (Apodemus agrarius), <b>short-tailed</b> <b>vole</b> (Microtus agrestis) and bank vole. One pellet contained 111 (mean 2. 34 – 0. 09) prey items. Amphibians were the most numerous during May and June...|$|E

Further outbreaks of the disease have led to fluctuating numbers of rabbits on the island.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the reservoir hosts of cowpox virus are wild rodents, although direct {{evidence for this}} is lacking {{for much of the}} virus's geographic range. Here, through a combination of serology and PCR, we demonstrate conclusively that the main hosts in Great Britain are bank voles, wood mice and <b>short-tailed</b> field <b>voles.</b> However, we also suggest that wood mice {{may not be able to}} maintain infection alone, explaining the absence of cowpox from Ireland where voles are generally not found. Infection in wild rodents varies seasonally, and this variation probably underlies the marked seasonal incidence of infection in accidental hosts such as humans and domestic cats...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Forty female meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus), bred from stock {{trapped in}} the wild, showed no regular cycles in their vaginal smear patterns. At autopsy, twenty virgin voles showed no {{evidence}} that spontaneous ovulations had occurred. Twenty recently mated females had fresh corpora lutea in their ovaries when killed. The conclusion was drawn that under laboratory conditions this species is an induced ovulator, coitus providing the stimulus for ovulation. A leucocytic invasion of a previously cornified or nucleated smear pattern is an indicator of ovulation in the meadow vole. Vaginal smear patterns and studies of ovarian structure, before and after coitus, show the <b>short-tailed</b> field <b>vole,</b> Microtus agrestis (Austin, 1957; Chitt...|$|R
50|$|Species foundThe meadow voles and shrews {{reflect the}} former fields {{rather than the}} current shrubs. In the woody {{vegetation}} there is a range of animals from small to large including meadow <b>voles,</b> <b>short-tailed</b> shrews, white-footed mice, raccoons, masked shrew. prairie deer mouse, prairie vole, and meadow jumping mouse. Signs of white-tailed deer, eastern cottontail, eastern chipmunk, eastern fox squirrel, domestic dog, and red fox were found.|$|R
50|$|Small mammals consume conifer seeds, {{and also}} eat seedlings. Cage feeding of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi) showed a daily maximum seed {{consumption}} of 2000 white spruce seeds and of 1000 seeds of lodgepole pine, with the 2 species of mice consuming {{equal amounts of}} seed, but showing a preference for the pine over the spruce (Wagg 1963). The <b>short-tailed</b> meadow <b>vole</b> (Microtus pennsylvanicus Ord) voraciously ate all available white spruce and lodgepole pine seedlings, pulling {{them out of the}} ground and holding them between their front feet until the whole seedling had been consumed. Wagg (1963) attributed damage observed to the bark and cambium at ground level of small white spruce seedlings over several seasons to meadow voles.|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of the uterine wall in {{the virgin}} pregnant and postpartum <b>short-tailed</b> field <b>vole</b> (Microtus agrestis) was studied with particular reference to the distribution of granulated metrial gland (GMG) cells. In comparison with the mouse, the changes which occur in the uterine wall during pregnancy and into the postpartum period are broadly similar. However, unlike in the mouse, GMG cells were {{a feature of the}} uterine wall in virgin mice and of the antimesometrial decidua in pregnancy. In pregnancy, GMG cells were not found in the lumina of blood vessels in the uterine wall or in the maternal blood spaces of the fetal placenta. During early pregnancy, giant interstitial trophoblast cells invade the decidualising endometrium. No association was found between uterine leucocytes, including GMG cells, and interstitial trophoblast cells, indicating that the trophoblast invasion is not influenced by leucocytes...|$|R
40|$|Life-history theory {{assumes that}} animal life {{histories}} are {{a consequence of}} trade-offs between current activities and future reproductive performance or survival, because resource supply is limited. Empirical evidence for such trade-offs in the wild are common, yet investigations of the underlying mechanisms are rare. Life-history trade-offs may have both physiological and ecological mediated costs. One hypothesized physiological mechanism is that elevated energy metabolism may increase reactive oxygen species production, leading to somatic damage and thus compromising future survival. We investigated the impact of experimentally elevated energy expenditure on oxidative damage, protection and lifespan in <b>short-tailed</b> field <b>voles</b> (Microtus agrestis) maintained in captivity to remove any confounding ecological factor effects. Energy expenditure was elevated via lifelong cold exposure (7 ± 2 °C), relative to siblings in the warm (22 ± 2 °C). No treatment effect on cumulative mortality risk was observed, with negligible effects on oxidative stress and antioxidant protection. These data suggest that in captive animals physiologically mediated costs on life history do not result from increased energy expenditure and consequent elevations in oxidative stress and reduced survival...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic vocalizations {{of infant}} rodents {{are used in}} {{developmental}} studies and for investigating the effects of drugs or environmental pollutants. Few studies, however, have analyzed the frequency characteristics of these ultrasonic vocalizations. This study investigates the physical and vocal development of infants (1 - 14 days old) of the <b>short-tailed</b> field <b>vole,</b> Microtus agrestis, under 2 conditions of isolation: at 23 °C immediately after being isolated from the nest or at 23 °C after 10 min of isolation at 27 °C. Seventy-three percent of the infants vocalized, and there was great variation among calling infants {{in the number of}} vocalizations emitted. More infants, especially males, called during the 2 nd period of isolation than during the 1 st, and latency to call increased with age in males. The ultrasonic vocalizations were comparable to those recorded from North American voles. Vocalizations were classified into 7 categories on the basis of characteristics of the fundamental frequency. Simple calls were emitted most commonly and became more frequent in older infants, whereas the proportion of calls with a down-sweep in frequency and audible clicks decreased with age. The emission of ultrasonic calls, therefore, appears to reflect changes both in physical development of the infants and in their external environmen...|$|R
40|$|Aerobic organisms {{continually}} face {{exposure to}} {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) and many have evolved sophisticated antioxidant systems to effectively remove them. Any increase in ROS production or weakening in this defense system may ultimately lead to oxidative stress and cellular damage. We investigated whether long-term cold exposure, which is known to lead to an elevation in metabolic rate, increased {{the activities of the}} ROS-scavenging enzymes, catalase (CAT), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and total superoxide dismutase (Total-SOD) in liver, cardiac muscle, kidney, skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis), and duodenum of <b>short-tailed</b> field <b>voles</b> (Microtus agrestis), born and maintained at either 8 ± 3 °C or 22 ± 3 °C. CAT, GPx, and Total-SOD activities were determined at age 61 ± 1. 9 days. An increase in CAT activity in voles maintained at 8 ± 3 °C was observed in skeletal muscle (71 %) and kidney (20 %), with both CAT and GPx activities significantly elevated (by 40 and 43 %, respectively) in cardiac muscle, when compared to voles at 22 ± 3 °C. Total-SOD activity and protein content did not differ significantly between groups in any tissue. We suggest that the compensatory increases in CAT (skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, kidney) and GPx (cardiac muscle), but not Total-SOD activities, resulting from long-term cold exposure may reflect the elevated metabolic rate, and possibly also increased ROS production, at this time...|$|R
40|$|Resting {{metabolic}} {{rates at}} thermoneutral (RMRts) are unexpectedly variable. One {{explanation is that}} high RMRts intrinsically potentiate a greater total daily energy expenditure (DEE), but recent work has suggested that DEE is extrinsically defined by the environment, which independently affects RMRt. This extrinsic effect could occur because expenditure is forced upwards in poor habitats or enabled to rise in good habitats. We provide here an intraspecific test for an association between RMRt and DEE that separates intrinsic from extrinsic effects and forcing from enabling effects. We measured the DEE and RMRt of 75 free-living <b>short-tailed</b> field <b>voles</b> at two time points in late winter. Across all sites, there was a positive link between individual variation in RMRt and DEE. This correlation, however, emerged only because of an effect across sites, rather than because of an intrinsic association within sites. We defined site quality from the survivorship of voles at the sites and the time at which they commenced breeding in spring. The associations between DEE/RMRt and site quality suggested that in February voles in poorer sites had higher energy demands, indicating that DEE was forced upwards, but in March the opposite was true, with higher demands in good sites, indicating that high expenditure was enabled. These data show that daily energy demands are extrinsically defined, with a link to RMRt that is secondary or independent. Both forcing and enabling effects of the environment may pertain {{at different times of}} year...|$|R
40|$|Nest {{construction}} {{is an extremely}} widespread behaviour. In small endotherms the nest serves primarily to provide insulation, and thereby retard heat loss of the constructor, or its offspring. In arctic and temperate regions many small mammals build nests {{to protect themselves from}} low ambient temperatures. We measured the physical properties of nests built by <b>short-tailed</b> field <b>voles</b> Microtus agrestis that were kept in captivity under cold conditions. The most important factor influencing nest insulation was nest wall thickness; however, nests with thick walls also contained more nesting material. Insulative capacity of the nest did not reach an asymptote up to nests containing 20 g of material. Nest insulation was not correlated with resting metabolic rate, body mass or body composition of the vole that constructed the nest. However, nests built by males had greater insulation than those made by females; males also had significantly lower food intake rates when compared to females with nests. No significant difference was observed in either fat mass or whole animal thermal conductance between males and females. Thermal conductance did increase significantly with increasing body mass, although not with resting metabolic rate. Voles with nests for prolonged periods had lower food intakes than voles without nests. The absolute saving averaged 1. 9 g and was independent of body mass. This was a 28 % saving on intake for a 22 -g vole but only an 18 % saving for a 40 -g individual. When voles had nests for short periods they used the energy they saved to reduce food intake and increase body mass...|$|R
40|$|During cold exposure, animals upregulate their {{metabolism}} and food intake, potentially exposing them to elevated {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) production and oxidative damage. We investigated whether acute cold (7 ± 3 °C) exposure (1, 10, or 100 h duration) affected protein oxidation and proteasome activity, when compared to warm controls (22 ± 3 °C), in a small mammal model, the <b>short-tailed</b> field <b>vole</b> Microtus agrestis. Protein carbonyls and the chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity were measured in plasma, heart, liver, kidney, small intestine (duodenum), skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius), and brown adipose tissue (BAT). Trypsin-like and peptidyl-glutamyl-like proteasome activities were determined in BAT, liver, and skeletal muscle. Resting metabolic rate increased significantly with duration of cold exposure. In skeletal muscle (SM) and liver, protein carbonyl levels also increased with duration of cold exposure, but this pattern was not repeated in BAT where protein carbonyls were not significantly elevated. Chymotrpsin-like proteasome activity {{did not differ significantly}} in any tissue. However, trypsin-like activity in SM and peptidyl-glutamyl-like activity in both skeletal muscle and liver, were reduced during the early phase of cold exposure (1 – 10 h), correlated with the increased carbonyl levels in these tissues. In contrast there was no reduction in proteasome activity in BAT during the early phase of cold exposure and peptidyl-glutamyl-like activity was significantly increased, correlated with the lack of accumulation of protein carbonyls in this tissue. The upregulation of proteasome activity in BAT may protect this tissue from accumulated oxidative damage to proteins. This protection may be a very important factor in sustaining uncoupled respiration, which underpins nonshivering thermogenesis at cold temperatures...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that elevation of an organism’s metabolic rate, such as cold exposure, will lead to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.   If this ROS production exceeds the antioxidant defence and repair mechanisms, oxidative stress will occur, particularly to proteins, lipids and DNA resulting in a decreased longevity. ROS scavengers, such as exogenous antioxidants, have been suggested as effective ‘anti-ageing’ strategies, and were expected to reverse the suggested increase in ROS production, caused by long-term cold exposure, and increase longevity.   I sought to test these ideas in a novel small mammalian model, the <b>short-tailed</b> field <b>vole,</b> Microtus agrestis. Cold exposure caused the metabolic rate of voles to increase by approximately 50 %.   This was expected to cause an increase in oxidative damage, but contradictory to the ‘free radical’ theory of ageing there were no increases in oxidative lymphocyte or hepatocyte DNA damage or hepatic lipid peroxidation.   In vole hepatocytes, with advancing age, lipid peroxidation decreased and the levels of endogenous antioxidants increased.   Using electron spin resonance (ESR) the in vitro incubation of liver microsomes with an iron/ADP solution did not indicate an increase in lipid radical production either with age or cold exposure.   The longevity of cold exposed voles was not significantly different to that of warm housed controls. The supplementation of voles with either a-tocopherol or ascorbic acid reduced lipid peroxidation and increased the levels of endogenous antioxidants compared to non-supplemented controls, but did not have any effect on oxidative lymphocyte DNA damage.   There {{were no significant differences in}} the mean lifespans of supplemented voles compared to non-supplemented voles. This study indicates that the postulated link between metabolic rate and ageing may not be as tight as first thought, and that dietary antioxidants are ineffective in extending the lifespan of voles.
