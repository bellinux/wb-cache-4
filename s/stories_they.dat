5|$|As a philologist, Tolkien's {{interest}} in languages {{led him to}} invent several languages of his own as a pastime. In considering the nature of who might speak these languages, and what <b>stories</b> <b>they</b> might tell, Tolkien again turned {{to the concept of}} elves.|$|E

5|$|Paul Geerts {{joined the}} Studio in 1968, where he at first {{worked as an}} artist on the German Jerom comics. Already in 1969, he {{replaced}} De Rop as the main inker for Suske en Wiske. Geerts also drew Vandersteens attention when he proposed a few scenario's for Jerom, and in 1971 {{he made his first}} story for Suske en Wiske. From 1972 on, he became the main creator of the flagship series Suske en Wiske, which he continued until the late 1990s. De Rop and Goossens again became the main inkers, with Geerts responsible for the stories and the pencil art. In these years, Suske en Wiske reached its peak popularity, and the older stories now were republished in colours in the main series. In 1975 and 1976, the Dutch television broadcast six puppet movies with new Suske en Wiske <b>stories.</b> <b>They</b> were very successful and sales of new albums reached over 200,000 copies. The merchandising business boomed as well, and commercial comics were one of the main new jobs for the Studio.|$|E
5|$|The initial premise {{placed the}} story on a space station to avoid the {{ecological}} damage that the creatures would have on a planet. However, Gerrold's agent was concerned that requiring a miniature of the station to be built {{as well as the}} additional sets would cause it to be too expensive for a single episode. Because of his agent's comments, Gerrold modified the pitch to place the action on a colony planet instead. This pitch included the plot points such as the creatures getting into a poisoned grain storage, but omitted the Klingons; and Cyrano Jones was called Cyrano Smith. The five pitches were submitted by Gerrold's agent in February 1967, and received a response in June. At the time the show had already purchased too many scripts for the second season but story editor D. C. Fontana suggested that they should purchase the story and assign it to a staff writer as it was better than some of the other <b>stories</b> <b>they</b> already had.|$|E
5|$|Zito {{wanted to}} put {{together}} some demos to present the technology to Hasbro. Riley wanted {{to create an environment}} the player could move freely about, leading to the idea of surveillance cameras. Fulop and Riley were inspired by the play Tamara (1981) which ran parallel stories running in 13 different rooms. The audience would need to decide for themselves which <b>stories</b> <b>they</b> wanted to follow. Fulop and Riley watched the play three times {{over the course of a}} weekend in 1985. Fulop and Riley liked the design model and thought it would make a good basis for an interactive media experience. A prototype game titled Scene of the Crime was produced to demonstrate the new technology to Hasbro and test the surveillance camera gameplay. It was a short five-minute demo where the player follows suspicious characters around a house to find who stole a stash of money. The player switches between cameras to observe the characters and eavesdrop on their conversations; all the characters have a plot to steal the money. At the end of the game, the player must guess who stole the money. In December 1986, the team flew to Hasbro headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and pitched the technology to Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and a board room of 22 executives who liked the system and gave funding to support further development for the technology and games.|$|E
