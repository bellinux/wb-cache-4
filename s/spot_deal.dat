40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study on the}} {{measures}} to provide vegetables and fruits for food service industry by leading wholesalers in wholesale markets. Conclusion is as follows: 1) The supply for food service industry by these wholesalers started from 2000 's, and as yet has a small market share in these companies but is increasing rapidly. 2) These wholesalers fix the monthly sale price for the previous month and get the weekly order from the previous week from food service industries. Both the sale price and quantity to food service industries are decided in the longer span than large scale retailers which fix the price a week before and order the previous day. 3) Some wholesalers sell vegetables and fruits through secondary wholesalers, others sell directly to food service industries. In the case of the latter, wholesalers conduct the delivery function by themselves. 4) These wholesalers procure vegetables and fruits mainly from agricultural cooperatives because agricultural cooperatives are the main suppliers for wholesale markets and can build trace back systems easier than middlemen. 5) The procurement of vegetables and fruits is classified into contract <b>dealing</b> and <b>spot</b> <b>dealing.</b> In the case of contract, wholesalers fix price and quantity at planting period. But it is very risky for wholesalers to procure all vegetables and fruits by contract, so wholesalers partially purchase from spot markets.

30|$|Most {{systems in}} science and {{industry}} are perturbed by some random environmental effects, which are often described as Gaussian noise. As a special non-Gaussian Lévy noise, Poisson noise is usually a hot <b>spot</b> when <b>dealing</b> with stochastic systems. Stoyanov and Bainov [4] investigated the averaging method for a class of stochastic differential equations with Poisson noise. They considered the connections between the solutions of a standard form and the solutions of averaged systems and proved that under some conditions the solutions of averaged systems converge to the solutions of original systems in mean square and in probability. Following the Bogolyubov theorem (cf.

Instead of Poisson noise, Xu et al. [7] established an averaging principle for stochastic differential equations with general non-Gaussian Lévy noise.|$|R

40|$|Indonesia {{has been}} {{haunted by the}} "spectre of communism" since the putsch by {{military}} officers on 1 October 1965. That event saw the country's top brass murdered and the military attributing this putsch to the Communist Party. The genocide that followed was triggered by a campaign of sexual slander. This led to the real coup and the replacement of President Sukarno by General Suharto. Today, accusations about communism {{continue to play a}} major role in public life and state control remains shored up by control over women's bodies. This article introduces the putsch and the socialist women's organisation Gerwani, members of which were, at the time, accused of sexual debauchery. The focus is on the question of how Gerwani was portrayed in the aftermath of the putsch and how this affects the contemporary women's movement. It is found that women's political agency has been restricted, being associated with sexual debauchery and social turmoil. State women's organisations were set up and women's organisations forced to help build a "stable" society, based on women's subordination. The more independent women's groups were afraid to be labelled "new Gerwani " as that would unleash strong state repression. This article assesses the implications of these events for the post- 1998 period of Reformasi and reviews some recent analyses of 1965, state terrorism and violence and reveals blind <b>spots</b> in <b>dealing</b> with gender and sexual politics. It is argued that the slander against Gerwani is downplayed in these analyses.

3000|$|... (2) All the time, the {{complete}} Coriolis force {{has been an}} important research hot <b>spot</b> in <b>dealing</b> with the atmosphere and ocean. On the one hand, the horizontal component of {{the complete}} Coriolis force shows the imbalance of the motion, which is an important factor that causes the development of weather system. On the other hand, the theoretical research on the nonlinear Rossby waves in the atmosphere has been a very important subject in meteorology. So, it is necessary to analyze the effect of intact Coriolis force on atmospheric dynamics. However, in order to calculate and study it conveniently, many researchers ignore the complete Coriolis force. As we know, the TA is suitable for quantitative studies. In the past, Kasahara [15] pointed out that the errors made by ignoring the vertical acceleration may be much larger than those made by ignoring the horizontal component of complete Coriolis force. However, it is controversial from the dynamical perspective [16, 17]. White and Bromley [18] indicated the necessity to retain the horizontal component of Coriolis force by scale analysis of the zonal momentum equations. It is necessary to include the cosine Coriolis terms for fully understanding the atmospheric motion, which is named ‘non-traditional approximation’ (NTA). Based on the NTA, the near-inertial waves were considered by Gerkema and Shrira [19] from primitive equations. Using the variational method, a conserved potential vorticity equation with complete Coriolis force was obtained by Dellar and Salmon [20]. According to the Hamilton least-action principle [21], Dellar also derived a generalized beta plane equation. So, the NTA is more important for tropical atmosphere, such as the stability theory [22 – 24], the dispersion relation [25, 26], the Madden-Julian Oscillation(MJO) [27, 28], and so on [29 – 31].|$|R

40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} {{the role of}} aeration {{as part of a}} comprehensive management program for maintaining the quality of stored grain. Grain is stored {{for a variety of reasons}} including expectations of higher prices and for use as animal feed. Regardless of the reason, a comprehensive management program is required to maintain grain quality. This includes: 1) making sure that the grain going into storage is dry, clean and in good condition; 2) regularly inspecting the grain to locate temperature, moisture, or insect problems; and 3) aerating the grain to maintain uniform temperature and moisture conditions, prevent localized hot spot development, and to cool existing or developing hot <b>spots.</b> This NebGuide <b>deals</b> specifically with the aeration part of an overall management program for dry grain in storage. Aeration systems should not be confused with the higher airflow system designed for natural air drying. Stored grain is aerated primarily to control grain temperature. Relatively low airflow rates, typically between 1 / 10 and 1 / 5 cubic feet of air per minute per bushel (cfm/bu), are adequate for this purpose. These airflow rates are not high enough to do a significant amount of drying. It is important that grain be stored at the proper moisture content and that the aeration system is managed to maintain favorable storage conditions...|$|R

40|$|Any {{model for}} the {{formation}} of elliptical planetary nebulae (PNs) should account for the positive correlation between the mass loss rate and the degree of departure from sphericity of the AGB progenitor’s wind. I propose that this correlation results from dust formation above magnetic cool <b>spots.</b> The model <b>deals</b> with elliptical PNs, but not with bipolar PNs. The basic assumption is that a weak dynamo amplifies magnetic fields in AGB stars, such that magnetic cool spots are formed, mainly near the equatorial plane. Enhanced dust formation above these cool spots leads to a higher mass loss rate in the equatorial plane, resulting in the formation of an elliptical PN. The dust formation above cool spots becomes much more efficient when mass loss rate is high. In addition to explaining the correlation, the model has the advantage that it can operate for very slowly rotating AGB stars, having rotation velocities of less than 10 − 4 times the break-up velocity. Such velocities can be achieved by a planet companion of mass ∼ 0. 1 MJupiter which spins-up the envelope, or even from singly evolved stars which leave the main sequence with a high rotation velocity. The sporadic nature of magnetic cool spots also leads to the formation of filaments, arcs, and clumps in the descendant PN. The model cannot explain the presence of jets and ansae in elliptical PNs. These are attributed to the destruction of a planet or brown dwarf on the AGB core. – 2 – 1...|$|R
