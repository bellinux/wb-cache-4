40|$|ObjectivesCardiac {{functional}} {{deterioration in}} dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) {{is known to}} be reversed by intramyocardial up-regulation of multiple cardioprotective factors, whereas a prostacyclin analog, ONO 1301, has been shown to paracrinally activate interstitial cells to release a variety of protective factors. We here hypothesized that intramyocardial delivery of a <b>slow-releasing</b> <b>form</b> of ONO 1301 (ONO 1301 SR) might activate regional myocardium to up-regulate cardiotherapeutic factors, leading to regional and global functional recovery in DCM. Methods and ResultsONO 1301 elevated messenger RNA and protein level of hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and stromal-derived factor- 1 of normal human dermal fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Intramyocardial delivery of ONO 1301 SR, which is ONO 1301 mixed with polylactic and glycolic acid polymer (PLGA), but not that of PLGA only, yielded significant global functional recovery in a canine rapid pacing–induced DCM model, assessed by echocardiography and cardiac catheterization (n =  5 each). Importantly, speckle-tracking echocardiography unveiled significant regional functional recovery in the ONO 1301 -delivered territory, consistent to significantly increased vascular density, reduced interstitial collagen accumulation, attenuated myocyte hypertrophy, and reversed mitochondrial structure in the corresponding area. ConclusionsIntramyocardial delivery of ONO 1301 SR, which is a PLGA-coated <b>slow-releasing</b> <b>form</b> of ONO 1301, up-regulated multiple cardiotherapeutic factors in the injected territory, leading to region-specific reverse left ventricular remodeling and consequently a global functional recovery in a rapid-pacing–induced canine DCM model, warranting a further preclinical study to optimize this novel drug-delivery system to treat DCM...|$|R

We recommend that further work should employ non-nodulatiog genotypes of chickpea as reference plants and use <b>slow-release</b> <b>forms</b> of 15 N fertilizer. Direct genotype comparison by isotope dilution estimated that genotype K 850 fixed 16 – 18 kg ha– 1 more N than G 130, and this difference was supported by the greater nodule mass and acetylene reduction activity in the K 850 cultivar. Inoculation with an ineffective chickpea Rhizobium sp. led to 69 % nodulation on cultivar K 850 but only 33 % on G 130. While nodule weight, N uptake, and acetylene reduction activity decreased with inoculation in K 850, the isotope dilutions were similar for both inoculation treatments.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{cardiovascular}} {{effects of}} intravenous verapamil and 3 months of oral administra-tion of a <b>slow-release</b> <b>form</b> of verapamil (verapamil-SR) were studied in 10 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Intravenous verapamil reduced arterial pressure by 15 % (p <. 01) through a fall in total peripheral resistance of 29 % (p <. 01); provoked a reflexive rise in heart rate (by 19 %, p <. 02), cardiac output (by 74 %, p <. 01), and plasma catecholamines; and shifted intravascular volume toward the cardiopulmonary circulation indicating peripheral venoconstriction. Quite in con-trast {{to the immediate}} effects of the intravenous drug, oral therapy with verapamil-SR for 2 to 3 months lowered arterial pressure effectively (by 15 %, p <. 01) by inducing vasodilation of 15 % (p <. 02), but without causing reflex tachycardia, activation of the sympathetic-adrenergic or renin-angiotensin systems, or volume expansion. Oral therapy with verapamil-SR preserved systemic and renal blood flow and slightly reduced cardiac mass (by 6 %, p <. 05) and renal vascular resistance (by 25 %, p <. 05). Whereas intravenous verapamil tended to depress myocardial contractility, oral verapamil-SR did not at all affect myocardial contractility or left ventricular function.

Although the prostaglandin pathway plays {{a pivotal role in}} lung development, the reported efficacy of postnatal prostaglandin agonist treatment is suboptimal. We hypothesized that prenatal treatment with ONO- 1301 SR, a <b>slow-release</b> <b>form</b> of a novel synthetic prostacyclin agonist with thromboxane inhibitory activity, might enhance the development of lungs exhibiting hypoplasia in the fetal period. On embryonic day (E) 9. 5, nitrofen was given to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats to establish a CDH-related lung hypoplasia model, whereas normal rats received the vehicle only. The same day, either ONO- 1301 SR or a placebo was also randomly administered. On E 21. 5, the fetuses of the normal group and those exhibiting CDH were analyzed. Prenatal ONO- 1301 SR administration had no influence on the incidence of nitrofen-induced CDH. The lung-to-body weight ratio in the CDH+ONO group was greater than that in the CDH group. Histologically, the medial wall in the CDH+ONO group was two-thirds thinner than that in the CDH group. In addition, the number of Ttf- 1 -positive cells and the capillary density were ≥ 1. 5 times greater in the CDH+ONO group than in the CDH group, and this increase was associated with higher expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal cell-derived factor in the CDH+ONO group, suggesting enhanced development of the alveolar and capillary networks. Thus, prenatal ONO- 1301 SR was protective against the progression of lung hypoplasia associated with CDH in a nitrofen-induced rat model, indicating the potential of this treatment for pathologies exhibiting lung hypoplasia...|$|E

Four different types of stents were implanted in 20 iliac arteries in 10 mini pigs as follows: a bare-metal stent (BMS) (group 1, n= 5), a drug-free hybrid stent (group 2, n= 5), a 50 % (50 [*]:[*] 100, w/w) paclitaxel (PTX) /poly-lactide-co-glycolic acid (PLGA; fast PTX-releasing form) hybrid stent (group 3, n= 5), and a 30 % (30 [*]:[*] 100, w/w) PTX/PLGA (slow PTX-releasing form) hybrid stent (group 4, n= 5).

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Meadowfoam {{has been}} {{identified}} as a potential oilseed crop for production on poorly drained soils in areas with cool, moist winters. The effects of N fertilizer on meadowfoam (Limnanthes alba Benth.) have been studied in Oregon and Maryland, but the results have not been consistent with respect to the effects on oil yield: yields were reduced in most cases but significantly increased in another. Excessive lodging and incidence of fungal infection were associated with N fertilization in some studies. This study evaluated the effects of twelve combinations of N rate and timing on meadowfoam oil yields and on plant growth and development. Meadowfoam selection 703 -A received 50, 100, and 200 kg N ha - 1 applied in fall, winter, spring, and fall/spring application schedules (regimes). Each N treatment and the control were replicated four times in randomized complete blocks on the Hyslop Research Station of Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon. All N treatment means for seed and oil yield were greater than the control mean. Winter applications of N fertilizer increased the efficiency of fertilizer use, increased floral density, produced relatively early dry weight gains and flowering, and increased seed-oil content. Fall-applied fertilizer N responses were reduced by leaching losses, but it appeared that some quantity of N fertilizer should be applied in the fall and another application made in late winter (before March) for optimal seed-oil yields. Fall applications of <b>slow-release</b> <b>forms</b> of N should also be studied...|$|R

Plants growing on these sands frequently exhibit nutrient deficiencies and rapidly changing nutrient levels due to the low nutrient-holding capacity of this medium. Our objectives were {{to determine the effects of}} N, P, K, and N × K and P × K interactions on the growth of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera Huds.) in calcareous sand greens. Measurements included visual ratings of turfgrass quality, soil and tissue nutrient levels, and golf ball roll distance. Creeping bentgrass plots receiving 5. 5 kg P ha− 1 yr− 1 had lower quality than the remainder of the treatments (27. 5 – 110 kg P ha− 1 yr− 1). Interactions between P and K were not observed. Ball roll was negatively correlated with soil test P. According to linear plateau regression analysis, soil test P level was 3. 0 mg kg− 1 soil, and tissue test P was 0. 4 % for maximum quality. Nitrogen fertilizer treatments increased turfgrass quality with each successively higher treatment. No N × K interactions were observed. No significant effect of K on turfgrass quality was observed; however, K rates increased soil test K, and tissue K showed a weak correlation (R 2 = 0. 13) with turfgrass quality. Potassium levels within the soil profile indicated leaching of K through the root zone.

Organic materials suitable for composting include leaves, yard and garden debris, grass or cereal straw, food waste, sewage sludge, and livestock manure. With proper control, composting can produce the same prod-ucts as would occur naturally, but much more quickly.

40|$|Unsustainable farming {{practices}} such as shifting cultivation and slash-and-burn agriculture in the humid tropics threaten {{the preservation of the}} rainforest and the health of the local and global environment. In weathered soils prone to cohesion in humid tropic due to low Fe and carbon content and the enormous amounts of P that can be adsorbed, sustainable soil use is heavily dependent on the availability and efficient use of nutrients. This paper reviews the literature in the field and provides some insights about sustainable soil use in the humid tropics, mainly for the Brazilian Amazonia region. Careful management of organic matter and physical and chemical indicators is necessary to enhance root growth and nutrient uptake. To improve the rootability of the arable layer, a combination of gypsum with continuous mulching to increase the labile organic matter fraction responsible for the formation of a short-lived structure important for root growth is recommended, rather than tillage. Unlike mulching, mechanical disturbance via ploughing of Amazonian soils causes very rapid and permanent soil organic matter losses and often results in permanent recompaction and land degradation or anthropic savannization; thus, it should be avoided. Unlike in other regions, like southeast Brazil, saturating the soil solely with inorganic potassium and nitrogen soluble fertilizers is not recommended. Nutrient retention in the root zone can be enhanced if nutrients are added in a <b>slow-release</b> <b>form</b> and if biologically mediated processes are used for nutrient release, as occurs in green manure. Therefore, an alternative that favors using local resources to increase the supply of nutrients and offset processes that impair the efficiency of nutrient use must be pursued...|$|E

In the present study, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of a <b>slow-release</b> <b>form</b> of lanreotide in patients with advanced NETs. From July 1996 to January 1999, 25 patients with advanced NETs (12 carcinoids, 13 endocrine pancreatic tumors) were enrolled in the study. Thirteen patients were pretreated with subcutaneous octreotide, chemotherapy, or hepatic metastasis alcoholization. All the patients had measurable disease. Seventeen patients were symptomatic and 20 patients had elevated serum and/or urine markers. Octreotide scintigraphy was positive in 23 of 25 patients. Lanreotide was administered as intramuscular injections at the dose of 30 mg every 2 weeks until there was objective, biochemical, or symptomatic tumor progression. Objective partial responses (PRs) were documented in 2 patients (8 %), whereas 10 patients (40 %) had tumor stabilization. The PRs were observed in patients with midgut carcinoids, of whom one was pretreated with subcutaneous octreotide. The response duration was 21 + and 24 + months in responding patients; the median duration of disease stabilization was 8. 5 months (range, 4 - 21 +). The overall biochemical response rate was 42 %, including 2 complete responses (CRs) (10. 5 %) and 6 PRs (31. 5 %); all biochemical responses were observed mostly in patients with carcinoid tumors; the duration of response was 18 + and 30 + months for CRs; the median duration of biochemical response was 7 months (range, 4 - 18 +) for PRs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} a protocol which enables determining luminal drug concentrations after oral drug administration in man. Human intestinal fluids were aspirated from two sampling sites (duodenum and jejunum) at different time points after oral intake of theophylline; an immediate- and a <b>slow-release</b> dosage <b>form</b> were used to demonstrate the feasibility of discriminating between different formulations. Osmolarity and pH of the aspirates were measured and theophylline concentrations were determined by HPLC-UV. After intake of the immediaterelease formulation of theophylline, duodenal maximum concentrations up to 3 mM were reached within 30 min. Theophylline appeared to be almost completely absorbed before it reached the second sampling site in the jejunum, as observed jejunal concentrations were lower than 10 % of the maximal duodenal concentrations. These results are in agreement with fast dissolution and fast absorption through the intestinal mucosa, which could be expected as theophylline belongs to class I of the Biopharmaceutical Classification System. In contrast to the immediate-release formulation, administering the <b>slow-release</b> dosage <b>form</b> resulted in a gradual appearance of theophylline, reaching maximal intestinal concentrations below 300 muM. The proposed methodology can be used to assess luminal drug concentrations and to monitor the time- and site-dependent composition of intestinal fluids after intake of an oral dosage form. This approach may contribute to a better understanding of the behaviour of oral drug formulations in the gastrointestinal tract and may be exploited to further unravel the complexity of the gastrointestinal absorption process.

40|$|A {{field and}} three {{laboratory}} experiments {{were conducted to}} measure {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} in intensive irrigated maize-based systems managed at high yield levels with a view to understand how soil greenhouse gas productions are influenced by biogeochemical processes and crop management practices. Emissions ranged from 0. 23 to 116 g N 2 O-N ha− 1 d− 1 and 0. 18 to 54. 8 kg CO 2 -C h− 1 d− 1 for recommended cropping systems (CCP 1 M 1 and CSP 1 M 1) and 0. 93 to 162. 8 g N 2 O-N ha− 1 d− 1 and 1. 03 to 52. 3 kg CO 2 -C ha− 1 d− 1 for intensive cropping systems (CCP 3 M 2 and CSP 3 M 2). Average annual N 2 O emission estimate in intensively managed CC and CS rotations was 7. 5 kg N 2 O-N ha− 1 yr− 1 while average annual estimate in the recommended cropping systems (CCP 1 M 1 and CSP 1 M 1) was 5. 5 kg N 2 O-N ha − 1 yr− 1. Seasonal N 2 O emission peaks were associated with high soil NO 3 content, EC, soil/air temperature and water content. Average annual CO 2 emission estimates in both levels of cropping management were 5. 3 Mg CO 2 -C ha − 1 yr− 1 for CS rotation and 6. 8 Mg CO 2 -C ha− 1 yr− 1 for CC rotation suggesting that the CO 2 emissions were significantly influenced by the amount and kind of crop residue returned to the field from the previous crop. ^ The close relationship between soil electrical conductivity and N 2 O and CO 2 emissions in the field was further studied in the laboratory soil cores from six soil series (Kennebec, Floyd-Webster, Cecil, Sharpsburg, Yolo, and Valentine soils) at 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 dS m − 1 soil EC and 60 % and 90 % WFPS. In general, increasing soil EC values from 0. 52 dS m− 1 to 2. 02 dS m− 1 decreased the production of N 2 O via nitrification at 60 WFPS. However, at 90 % WFPS, rates of N 2 O production were directly related to soil EC values. Possible reasons for such an inverse relationship include: a change in the activities/functions of microbial communities, decrease of bioavailable C and N following salt addition and the ability of bacterial cells to tolerate water and salt stress conditions. Based on the laboratory study of field soils, there was a 26 % reduction of N 2 O emissions when a <b>slow-release</b> <b>form</b> of N fertilizer (ESN) was applied in the soil rather than NH 4 NO 3.

40|$|Background: Induced {{abortion}} {{is still a}} major health problem {{in the world and}} the most frequently performed intervention in Obstetrics and Gynaecology with an estimated total of 46 millions worldwide each year. Medical abortion with mifepristone and prostaglandin was first introduced in 1988, and is now approved in 29 countries. It has recently been included in the List of Essential Medicines by WHO. However, the regimen has undergone only minor changes since the introduction. The overall aim of the thesis was to evaluate possible improvements in medical abortion using mifepristone in combination with the prostaglandin E 1 analogue misoprostol. Different aspects of the treatment were studied including criteria for evaluation of complete abortion, acceptability, pain management and a new form of slow release misoprostol. Study I + II: Healthy women with an unwanted pregnancy who had chosen medical abortion were recruited. The use of ultrasound and hCG for the interpretation of the follow-up examination (n= 217) was evaluated in the first study and acceptance of home use of misoprostol (n= 100) in the second. hCG proved to be a more reliable indicator for assessment of outcome when compared to ultrasound, especially in very early pregnancy. Women gave a high priority to the free choice of the place of intake of misoprostol. Almost all women who had chosen home use of misoprostol were satisfied or very satisfied with their choice. Study III: Women undergoing medical abortion in second trimester (n= 74) were randomized to receive a prophylactic pain treatment together with misoprostol either including a NonSteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) or without NSAID. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the induction-to-abortion interval or the total doses of misoprostol needed. The frequency of surgical intervention was similar. Women in the group treated with NSAID required significantly less opiates. Study IV + V: A new <b>slow-release</b> <b>form</b> of misoprostol was compared with conventional oral misoprostol in women undergoing surgical abortion. Pharmacokinetics (n= 31) and uterine contractions (n= 30) were analysed. The SR misoprostol demonstrated lower peak plasma levels but longer lasting elevation in plasma levels than conventional oral misoprostol. SR misoprostol acts less on pain inducing uterine tonus than orally administered conventional misoprostol but leads to more regular uterine contractions. Conclusion: The current protocols for medical abortion have the potential for further improvement. The need for surgical intervention could be reduced with criteria for the interpretation of hCG and ultrasound findings at the follow up. Administration of misoprostol at home, gives women more autonomy in the course of medical abortion. NSAIDs do not prolong the time to expulsion in medical abortion and should be integral part of pain treatment, even given as prophylactic. The new oral slow release form of misoprostol may have potential to improve medical abortion as indicated by the effects on uterine contractility and pharmacokinetics...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the most severe {{complication}} of acromegaly accounting for the increased mortality of these patients. Recently, the <b>slow-release</b> <b>form</b> of octreotide (OCT; Sandostatin LAR, OCT-LAR), for im injection every 28 days, was reported to induce suppression of GH levels below 7. 5 mU/L (2. 5 microg/L) in 39 - 75 % of patients, and normalization of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -I levels for age in 64 - 88 % of patients, with an excellent patients' compliance. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the early effect of OCT-LAR treatment on the left ventricular (LV) structure and performance in 15 somatostatin analog-naive patients with acromegaly (GH, 94. 8 +/- 24. 9 mU/L; IGF-I, 757. 9 +/- 66. 6 microg/L), focusing on the early effect of GH and IGF-I suppression on the heart. Cardiac structure was investigated by echocardiography, whereas LV performance was investigated by gated-blood-pool scintigraphy, before and after 3 and 6 months of treatment with OCT-LAR. OCT-LAR was initially administered im, at a dose of 20 mg every 28 days, for 3 months. In six patients, the dose was then increased to 30 mg every 28 days to achieve disease control, which was considered when fasting and/or glucose-suppressed GH values were below 7. 5 and 3. 0 mU/L, respectively, together with IGF-I values within the normal range for age. The treatment with OCT-LAR for 6 months induced a significant decrease of GH (to 12. 9 +/- 3. 0 mU/L) and IGF-I levels (to 340. 3 +/- 40. 2 microg/L) in all 15 patients. After 6 months of treatment, the percent IGF-I suppression was 52. 8 +/- 4. 4 %, and serum GH/IGF-I levels were normalized in 9 patients. A significant decrease of LV mass index (LVMi), interventricular septum thickness, and LV posterior wall thickness was observed in all 15 patients after 3 and 6 months of OCT-LAR treatment: LVMi was decreased by 19. 1 +/- 2. 0 % without any difference in patients with (19. 9 +/- 2. 7 %) or without disease control (17. 8 +/- 3. 3 %). Among the 11 patients with LV hypertrophy, 6 normalized their LVMi after treatment. At study entry, an inadequate LV ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest (< 50 %) was found in 5 patients (33. 3 %), whereas an impaired response of LVEF at peak exercise (< 5 % increase of basal value) was found in 9 patients (60 %). A significant increase in LVEF, both at rest (from 51. 6 +/- 2. 6 to 58. 1 +/- 1. 7 %, P < 0. 01) and at peak exercise (from 51. 6 +/- 2. 3 to 60. 2 +/- 2. 4 %, P < 0. 001) was found in patients with (as compared with those without) disease control (from 55. 2 +/- 3. 8 to 58. 0 +/- 4 % and from 61. 8 +/- 4. 6 to 61. 8 +/- 3. 4 %, respectively). Among the 5 patients with inadequate LVEF at rest, all but 1 regained a normal LVEF after 6 months of treatment; whereas, among the 9 patients with an impaired response of the LVEF at peak exercise, 3 patients normalized, 4 improved, and 2 impaired their responses after treatment. The percent of IGF-I suppression was significantly correlated with the percent increase of resting LVEF (r = 0. 644, P < 0. 01). Exercise duration (from 6. 0 +/- 0. 7 to 7. 3 +/- 0. 7 min) and capacity (from 69. 0 +/- 8. 2 to 80 +/- 7. 8 watts) were increased in the 15 patients considered as a whole, but the improvement in the exercise response was significant only in patients with disease control (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05, respectively) who also had an increase in the peak ejection rate (P = 0. 03). No change in hemodynamic parameters, either at rest or at peak exercise, was found after treatment with OCT-LAR in the 15 patients. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that OCT-LAR im injections every 28 days induces a sustained suppression of GH levels and IGF-I levels in all acromegalic patients, allowing achievement of disease control in 60 % of patients after 6 months of treatment. The sustained suppression of IGF-I levels was followed by a significant reduction of LVMi in all patients already after 3 months of treatment, with recovery of LV hypertrophy in 6 of 11 patients.

40|$|Background: There are two <b>slow-release</b> {{ready-to-use}} <b>forms</b> of leuprorelin acetate (1 -month and 3 -month) {{that are}} available as solid, biodegradable implants {{for the treatment of}} advanced, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. These implants {{have been shown to be}} as effective as traditional leuprorelin acetate microspheres for achieving successful testosterone suppression (≥ 0. 5 ng/ml) and lowering prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Here we further evaluate testosterone suppression levels from four clinical trials evaluating the 3 -month leuprorelin implant, including analysis below the European Association of Urology (EAU) castration level (3 months. In both long-term, single-arm studies with the leuprorelin implant, median values of testosterone ≥ 0. 2 ng/ml were achieved at Week 4 and maintained until study completion (6 and 8 months); PSA decrease was also observed versus baseline. Conclusions: Long-lasting steady serum levels of testosterone, comparable with orchiectomy and consistent with the EAU-recommended castration level (< 0. 2 ng/ml), were achieved at Week 4 and maintained up to 8 months in men with advanced prostate cancer who received the leuprorelin implant...|$|R
40|$|Cells of henbane (Hyoscyamus muticus L.) grow indefinitely {{in culture}} without {{exogenous}} auxin. Cells of its temperature-sensitive variant XIIB 2 grow like the wild type at 26 [deg]C but die rapidly at 33 [deg]C unless auxin {{is added to}} the medium. Despite this temperature-sensitive auxin auxotrophy, XIIB 2 produces wild-type amounts of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA). IAA is the predominant auxin and is important for plant growth and development. Since the IAA production of the variant is functional, we investigated whether the synthesis or degradation of IAA metabolites, possibly active auxins themselves, is altered. The IAA metabolites were IAA-aspartate (IAAsp) and IAA-glucose. The wild type converted IAA mainly to IAAsp, whereas the variant produced mainly IAA-glucose. Exogenous auxin corrected the shunted IAA metabolism of the variant. The half-life of labeled IAAsp in the variant was reduced 21 -fold, but in the presence of exogenous auxin it was not different from the wild type. The temperature sensitivity of XIIB 2 was also corrected by supplying IAAsp. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that henbane rapidly metabolizes IAAsp to compounds not identical to IAA. The data show that the variant XIIB 2 is a useful tool to study the function of IAA conjugates to challenge the popular hypothesis that IAA conjugates are merely <b>slow-release</b> storage <b>forms</b> of IAA...|$|R
40|$|Background: Antioxidants and the {{duration}} of treatment after noise exposure on hearing recovery are important. We investigated the protective effects of an antioxidant substance, edaravone, and its <b>slow-release</b> dosage <b>form,</b> edaravone solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), in steady noise-exposed guinea pigs. Methods: SLNs loaded with edaravone were produced by an ultrasound technique. Edaravone solution or edaravone SLNs were administered by intratympanic or intravenous injection after the 1 st day of noise exposure. Guinea pigs were exposed to 110 dB sound pressure level (SPL) noise, centered at 0. 25 - 4. 0 kHz, for 4 days at 2 h/d. After noise exposure, the guinea pigs underwent auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold measurements, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected in their cochleas with electron spin resonance (ESR), and outer hair cells (OHCs) were counted with silvernitrate (AgNO 3) staining at 1, 4, and 6 days. Results: The ultrasound technique was able to prepare adequate edaravone SLNs with a mean particle size of 93. 6 nm and entrapment efficiency of 76. 7 %. Acoustic stress-induced ROS formation and edaravone exerted a protective effect on the cochlea. Comparisons of hearing thresholds and ROS changes in different animal groups showed that the threshold shift and ROS generation were significantly lower in treated animals than in those without treatment, especially in the edaravone SLN intratympanic injection group. Conclusions: Edaravone SLNs show noticeable slow-release effects and have certain protective effects against noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) ...|$|R

The objectives of this open study were to access the compliance and satisfaction consequences in the epileptic patients. Material and Method: In this prospective, multi-center study, the authors compared the compliance and satisfaction consequences in epileptic patients switched from more than two times daily sodium valproate enteric-coated tablet (SVEC) regimen to the same total daily dose of SVSR form given once or twice daily. Results: Eighty-nine of the 100 patients completed the study. 43. 8 % were male (39 of 89 patients). Mean age was 34. 74 + 12. 67 years. Most common etiology of epilepsy was idiopathic 40. 4 %. Patients were very/fairly happy with the SVSR form 94. 4 % compared to the SVEC form 56. 2 % (p = 0. 000).

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the relative efficacy of a non-degradable osmotic <b>slow-release</b> dosage <b>form</b> containing 6. 6 mg cetylpyridinium chloride (MOTS [Mucosal Oral Therapeutic System] CPC) to inhibit new plaque formation and gingivitis, a single-blind, randomised, parallel group pilot study was set up. 52 healthy volunteers {{were assigned to}} receive {{one of the following}} treatments for 18 days of non-brushing: holding 1 MOTS CPC 2 x daily for 2 h intra-orally, or rinsing 30 s with 15 ml Peridex 2 x daily, or dissolve Cepacol (each 1. 6 mg CPC) lozenges 2 x daily unsupervised. Before the test period, the subjects received a thorough tooth cleaning followed by tooth polishing 1 x a week for 3 weeks to achieve clinical gingival health. After the start of therapy, the subjects were examined at day 4, 7 (+/- 2), 14 (+/- 2) and 18 (2 +/-). Relative efficacy was assessed by the modified Navy plaque index, the Quigley and Hein index, the planimetric plaque index, as well as the papillary marginal gingival index. There was an increase in both plaque formation and gingivitis over the 18 +/- 2 day period of nonbrushing for all subjects in the study. Peridex was the most effective in inhibiting plaque and gingivitis formation over that period of time. There was no difference between MOTS CPC and Cepacol at any time point in plaque accumulation and gingivitis intensity. Peridex was considered more convenient than MOTS CPC. Cepacol resulted in more staining at 18 days than MOTS CPC and Peridex. status: publishe...|$|R
