50|$|To {{improve the}} engine’s {{low-speed}} torque range for off-roading and towing applications, Land Rover installed a large capacity single-turbocharger, rather than use the twin-turbo design; in addition {{the engine is}} fitted with a large engine driven cooling fan to support low speed, high load driving as may be encountered in desert conditions. Furthermore, the Land Rover variant of the Lion V6 includes a deeper, high <b>capacity</b> <b>sump</b> with improved baffles to maintain oil pressure at off-roading extreme angles and multi-layered seals to keep dust, mud and water at bay and different transmission bell housing bolt pattern. The Lion V6 - constructed from compacted graphite iron - {{is a member of}} the Ford Duratorq family and is produced at Ford’s Dagenham engine plant; 35,000 engines were produced from April to December 2004.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-1985, the 944 {{underwent}} {{its first}} significant changes. These included : a new dash and door panels, embedded radio antenna, upgraded alternator (from 90 amp to 115 amp), increased oil <b>sump</b> <b>capacity,</b> new {{front and rear}} cast alloy control arms and semi-trailing arms, larger fuel tank, optional heated and powered seats, Porsche HiFi sound system, and revisions in the mounting of the transaxle to reduce noise and vibration. The [...] "cookie cutter" [...] style wheels used in the early 944s were upgraded to new [...] "phone dial" [...] style wheels (Fuchs wheels remained an option). 1985 model year cars incorporating these changes are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "1985B", [...] "85.5" [...] or [...] "1985½" [...] cars.|$|E

5000|$|Three Mile Island Unit 2 {{was unable}} to contain about 480 PBq of {{radioactive}} noble gases from release into the environment and around 120 kL of radioactive contaminated cooling water from release beyond the containment into a neighbouring building. The pilot-operated relief valve at TMI-2 was designed to shut automatically after relieving excessive pressure inside the reactor into a quench tank. However the valve mechanically failed causing the PORV quench tank to fill, and the relief diaphragm to eventually rupture into the containment building. [...] The containment building sump pumps automatically pumped the contaminated water outside the containment building. Both a working PORV with quench tank and separately the containment building with sump provided two layers of passive safety. An unreliable PORV negated its designed passive safety. The plant design featured only a single open/close indicator based {{on the status of}} its solenoid actuator, instead of a separate indicator of the PORV's actual position. [...] This rendered the mechanical reliability of the PORV indeterminate directly, and therefore its passive safety status indeterminate. The automatic sump pumps and/or insufficient containment <b>sump</b> <b>capacity</b> negated the containment building designed passive safety.|$|E
40|$|A High Rise Building {{project is}} a {{collective}} output {{of a number of}} professionals, nonprofessionals, and skilled and non-skilled labour. In this regard the structural engineer has to playa major role. The structural engineer has to look in to all structural aspects such as shear wall layout and area and sizing of structural elements and non-structural aspecst, such as <b>sump</b> <b>capacity,</b> number of elevators, KVA rating, toilet details, etc. at {{the early stages of the}} project. Consideration of non-structural aspects may help to select a better structural form and to avoid change of structural systems in latter stages due to sudden addition of toilets, elevators, stairs etc. Structural Engineering Design is a science, It is also an art, which relies upon past experience and knowledge gained from the study of other projects should help to deal with new projects of a similar or even different nature. This research involved a literature survey, a survey of tall buildings and an analysis of their features. In the literature survey, some important case-by-case details were identified, as well as some general guidelines for building planning. In the tall building survey, an attempt was made to use the experience of construction of high-rise buildings in Sri Lanka for new projects. The study is based on sixteen high-rise buildings in Sri Lanka. The results show that some structural and non-structural guidelines could be adopted for new projects at the initial design stage...|$|E
