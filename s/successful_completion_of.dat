40|$|Abstract—These days, {{there are}} many studies on {{cognitive}} architectures, which are developed based on human cognitive models. Some other studies are focused on applying these cognitive architectures to the autonomous task execution of humanoid robots. In this paper, we have shown that a real world robot, Mahru-Z can execute a task autonomously in the Blocks World domain, using a cognitive architecture, ICARUS. For this project, diverse techniques such as system integration, human-like manipulation based on vision, environmental information update techniques etc are used. <b>Successful</b> <b>completions</b> <b>of</b> these tasks imply that we can expect similar results for the more diverse and complicated tasks as well.

40|$|We {{present a}} utility accrual {{real-time}} scheduling algorithm called CIC-VCUA, for tasks whose execution times are functions of their starting times. We model such variable execution times employing variable cost functions (or VCFs). The algorithm considers application {{activities that are}} subject to time/utility function time constraints (or TUFs), execution times de-scribed using VCFs, and concurrent, mutually exclusive sharing of non-CPU resources. We consider the multi-criteria scheduling objective of (1) assuring that the maximum interval between any two consecutive, <b>successful</b> <b>completions</b> <b>of</b> jobs of a task must not exceed a specified upper bound, and (2) maximizing the system’s total accrued utility, while satis-fying mutual exclusion resource constraints. Since the scheduling problem is intractable, CIC-VCUA statically computes worst-case sojourn times of tasks, selects tasks for execution based on their potential utility density, and completes them at specific times, in polynomial-time. We establish that CIC-VCUA achieves optimal timeliness during under-loads. Further, we identify {{the conditions under which}} timeliness assurances hold. Our simulation experi-ments illustrate CIC-VCUA’s effectiveness and superiority. Acknowledgment...|$|R

5|$|Apart {{from being}} an {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self-renewal. Hajj serves {{as a reminder of}} the Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will stand before God.

After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect in Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, and should not be a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E
5|$|As at Darwin, Herring's primary {{difficulty}} was logistics. The {{troops on}} the Kokoda Track had to be supplied from Port Moresby either by air or by Papuan native carriers who lugged stores over the track on their backs. MacArthur created the Combined Operation Service Command (COSC), an unusual combined Australian-American logistical organisation, under U.S. Brigadier General Dwight Johns, who in turn was answerable to Herring.

5|$|After {{a four-month}} investigation, the {{criminal}} justice branch of the Attorney General of British Columbia announced formal charges of assault causing bodily harm against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004. With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to one-and-a-half years in prison. Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging a plea bargain with prosecutors. He was given a conditional discharge requiring 80 {{hours of community service}} and one year's probation that additionally prohibited him from playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in. Under Canadian law, Bertuzzi's <b>successful</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> his probationary period precluded him from a criminal record. Moore expressed disappointment regarding Bertuzzi's discharge and was upset that he was unable to attend the court date, having to issue a written victim statement instead.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between the use of academic accommodations and <b>successful</b> program <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> students with disabilities enrolled in two campuses of a community college.

5|$|Apollo 8 {{was planned}} to be the D mission in December 1968, crewed by McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart, {{launched}} on a Saturn V instead of two Saturn IBs. In the summer it had become clear that the LM would not be ready in time. Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission. This would keep the program on track. The Soviet Union had sent two tortoises, mealworms, wine flies, and other lifeforms around the Moon on September 15, 1968, aboard Zond 5, and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts. The decision was not announced publicly until <b>successful</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> Apollo 7.

5|$|Faced by {{the threat}} of a {{sovereign}} default and potential resulting exit of the eurozone, some final attempts were made by the Greek government in May 2015 to settle an agreement with the Troika about some adjusted terms for Greece to comply with in order to activate the transfer of the frozen bailout funds in its current programme. The Eurogroup recently granted a six-month technical extension of its current bailout programme to Greece (now set to expire by the end of June 2015), which means the time window to complete negotiations and subsequently implement the conditional measures to unlock the remaining bailout transfers now is very short. Expectations are that Greece in addition will need a follow-up support programme starting 1 July 2015. The Troika announced the condition for offering Greece (and begin negotiations about) establishment of a follow-up programme would be a prior <b>successful</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> the re-negotiated current programme.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in {{relation}} to The Lost Age's battle mode is similar to traditional role-playing video games. In each battle, the player is required to defeat all the enemies using direct attacks with weapons, offensive Psynergy spells, and other means of causing damage, all while keeping their own party alive through items and supportive Psynergy that restore life and supplement defense. If all the player's characters are downed by reducing their hit points to zero, the party is returned to the last village that the player visited and suffers a monetary penalty. The <b>successful</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> a battle yields experience points, coins, and occasionally rare items. In addition to the main game itself, {{there is also a}} competitive battling mode accessible from the menu screen, where players can enter their teams into an arena to battle increasingly difficult CPU-controlled enemies or other players head-to-head.|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis analyses {{the evolution of}} responses to Jane Austen’s fiction through continuations of her unfinished novel The Watsons (c. 1803 - 5). Although the first full “appropriation” of an Austen novel ever published was a continuation of The Watsons and a total <b>of</b> eight <b>completions</b> appeared between 1850 and 2008, {{little research has been}} done to link the afterlife of The Watsons and changing perceptions of Austen. This thesis argues that the <b>completions</b> <b>of</b> The Watsons significantly illuminate Austen’s reception: they expose conflicting readings of Austen’s novels through textual negotiations between the completer’s and Austen’s voice. My study begins by examining how the first continuation, Catherine Hubback’s The Younger Sister (1850), implies an alternative image of the Victorian Austen to that propounded by James Edward Austen-Leigh, Austen’s first official biographer (Chapter 1). The next two chapters focus on the effects of World War I and II on modes of reading Austen. Through L. Oulton’s (1923), Edith Brown’s (1928) and John Coates’s (1958) <b>completions</b> <b>of</b> The Watsons, this study examines the connection between Austen’s fiction and different notions of Englishness, politics and the nation. Chapter Four addresses the contribution of the 1990 s completions to the debate over Austen’s feminism. Finally, Chapter Five analyses recent trends in Austenalia, which thwart the production <b>of</b> <b>successful</b> <b>completions</b> <b>of</b> The Watsons. My thesis presents the first substantial analysis of this body of work...|$|R
