From 1968-97 the Challinor Centre served as an institution for people with intellectual disabilities.

500|$|Many of {{the current}} leaders of Russian psychiatry, {{especially}} those who {{were related to the}} establishment in Soviet period, have resiled from their avowal read at the 1989 General Assembly of the WPA that Soviet psychiatry had been systematically abused for political purposes. Among such leaders who did so is Aleksandr Tiganov, a pupil of Snezhnevsky, full member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, the director of its Mental Health Research Center, and the chief psychiatrist of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. In 2011, when asked whether ill or healthy were those examined because of their disagreements with authority, Tiganov answered, [...] "These people suffered from sluggish schizophrenia and were on the psychiatric registry." [...] According to Tiganov, it was rumored that Snezhnevsky took pity on dissenters and gave them a diagnosis required for placing in a <b>special</b> <b>hospital</b> to save them from a prison, but it is not true, he honestly did his medical duty. The same ideas are voiced in the 2014 interview by Anatoly Smulevich, a pupil of Snezhnevsky, full member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences; he says what was attributed to Snesnevsky was that he recognized the healthy as the ill, it did not happen and is pure slander, it is completely ruled out for him to give a diagnosis to a healthy person.|$|E

50|$|Wish is a {{national}} charity that was founded in 1987 by Prue Stevenson, Terri Simpson and Kimberley Andrews. At the time, Prue {{was working in the}} Education Department at HMP Holloway in London. She became concerned about the high number of women whose mental health deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} they were transferred to the High Secure Hospitals, then known as <b>Special</b> <b>Hospitals</b> (Broadmoor Hospital, Rampton Secure Hospital and Ashworth Hospital). Terri and Kim were former patients who had spent many years in High Secure hospitals. Female patients in these hospitals were often subjected to appalling and degrading conditions, and many didn't require such a high level of security. The three women got together to form Wish with the aim of supporting women still in <b>Special</b> <b>Hospitals</b> and prison psychiatric units, and to campaign to change policy and attitudes.|$|R

40|$|This is an edited {{version of}} a {{conversation}} that took place between myself and four other clinical psychologists who had been actively involved in developing better services for women living in Ashworth and Rampton hospitals - two elf the three high security psychiatric hospitals in England There have been long-standing concerns {{about the quality of}} the services provided by these Special Hospitals,(1) and a public inquiry(2) in 1992 identified services to women as a particular cause for concern. This inquiry was followed by a period of optimism during which time these psychologists had worked hard to improve services to women in the <b>Special</b> <b>Hospitals.</b> We met in late 1996 to talk about their frustrations and disappointments, to learn from their experiences, and to remember the women who live in these hospitals. This was not an easy conversation, and it was also limited by a pending tribunal and the ever present threat of legal action. The <b>Special</b> <b>Hospitals</b> have continued to feature in news headlines, and their future is being publicly debated. We want this debate to be informed by an understanding of the ways in which <b>Special</b> <b>Hospitals</b> continue to fail women. There is nothing to suggest that they provide women with what they need, or that they are likely to do so in the future. The development of better community mental health services is the only way forward...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of psychiatric patients, {{even those who}} also offend against the law, {{are likely to be}} served best by good community services but a few of them will need treatment in a secure hospital. Treatment in high security for patients from England and Wales is provided by three <b>special</b> <b>hospitals.</b> In the 1980 s provision of medium-secure hospital units began, but there is still a considerable shortfall of such beds. Data from a variety of settings suggest that the continuing gap in medium-secure provision may be qualitative as well as quantitative. This paper considers the case for long-term medium security, and the likely size and nature of demand. It would be misleading to assume that those with long-term medium-security needs constitute a homogeneous group. Some new facilities, probably built on to existing medium secure hospital units, are likely to be needed; if estimates of real need for high security places are correct, then some places already exist and are being used by default in the <b>special</b> <b>hospitals.</b> For some patients, notwithstanding the old image of <b>special</b> <b>hospitals,</b> these may be ideal placements if redesignated, even redesigned. A variety of provision and effective cooperation between purchasers and providers will be essential to satisfy real need and ensure that the number of patients needing secure accommodation remains more or less within present estimates...|$|R
