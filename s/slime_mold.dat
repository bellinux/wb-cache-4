5|$|Carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), {{and seeds}} are also eaten. Two grey jays were seen eating <b>slime</b> <b>mold</b> (Fuligo septica) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This {{was the first}} report of any bird {{consuming}} <b>slime</b> <b>mold</b> in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in food selection for the grey jay, which selects food {{on the basis of}} profitability to maximize caloric intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for a preferred food item lowers its profitability. Grey jays wrench, twist, and tug food apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata), which grasp and hammer their food. Grey jays commonly carry large food items to nearby trees to eat or process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.|$|E
5|$|The larval period {{can vary}} widely. A fungus feeding staphylinid Phanerota fasciata {{undergoes}} three moults in 3.2 days {{at room temperature}} while Anisotoma sp. (Leiodidae) completes its larval stage in the fruiting body of <b>slime</b> <b>mold</b> in 2 days and possibly represents the fastest growing beetles. Dermestid beetles, Trogoderma inclusum can remain in an extended larval state under unfavourable conditions, even reducing their size between moults.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{evidence}} began accumulating {{to suggest that}} some GPCRs are able to signal without G proteins.

25|$|D. discoideum is a <b>slime</b> <b>mold,</b> part of {{a branch}} that might have emerged from {{eukaryotic}} ancestors about a billion years before the present. It seems that they emerged after the ancestors of green plants and the ancestors of fungi and animals had differentiated. But, {{in addition to their}} place in the evolutionary tree, the fact that PCD has been observed in the humble, simple, six-chromosome D. discoideum has additional significance: It permits the study of a developmental PCD path that does not depend on caspases characteristic of apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Dictyostelium discoideum is {{a species}} of soil-living amoeba {{belonging}} to the phylum Amoebozoa, infraphylum Mycetozoa. Commonly referred to as <b>slime</b> <b>mold,</b> D. discoideum is a eukaryote that transitions from a collection of unicellular amoebae into a multicellular slug and then into a fruiting body within its lifetime. Its unique asexual lifecycle consists of four stages: vegetative, aggregation, migration, and culmination. The lifecycle of D. discoideum is relatively short, which allows for timely viewing of all stages. The cells involved in the lifecycle undergo movement, chemical signaling, and development, which are applicable to human cancer research. The simplicity of its lifecycle makes D. discoideum a valuable model organism to study genetic, cellular, and biochemical processes in other organisms.|$|E

2500|$|The WRKY {{transcription}} factor family (pronounced ‘worky’) is {{a class of}} DNA-binding proteins.

[...] These roles are governed by an ever increasingly complex network of interactions with other DNA-binding and non-DNA-binding proteins.|$|E

2500|$|A 2011 {{report in}} Nature {{published}} findings that demonstrated a [...] "primitive farming behaviour" [...] in D. discoideum colonies. Described as a [...] "symbiosis" [...] between D. discoideum and bacterial prey, {{about one-third of}} wild-collected D. discoideum colonies engaged in the [...] "husbandry" [...] of the bacteria when the bacteria were included within the <b>slime</b> <b>mold</b> fruiting bodies. The incorporation of the bacteria into the fruiting bodies allows the [...] "seeding" [...] of the food source {{at the location of}} the spore dispersal, which is particularly valuable if the new location is low in food resources. Colonies produced from the [...] "farming" [...] spores typically also show the same behavior when sporulating. This incorporation has a cost associated with it: Those colonies that do not consume all of the prey bacteria produce smaller spores that cannot disperse as widely. In addition, much less benefit exists for bacteria-containing spores that land in a food-rich region. This balance of {{the costs and benefits of}} the behavior may contribute to the fact that a minority of D. discoideum colonies engage in this practice.|$|E
