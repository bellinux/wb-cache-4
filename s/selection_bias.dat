5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from <b>selection</b> <b>bias,</b> as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E

We theoretically and empirically characterize the robustness of the approach, finding that it is highly practical and scalable. Comment: 10 pages in ICML 201...|$|R

25|$|The strong anthropic {{principle}} (SAP) as explained by John D.

Some critics of the SAP argue in favor of a weak {{anthropic principle}} (WAP) similar to the one defined by Brandon Carter, which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of <b>selection</b> <b>bias</b> (specifically survivor bias): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting upon fine tuning. Most often such arguments draw upon some notion of the multiverse for there to be a statistical population of universes to select from and from which <b>selection</b> <b>bias</b> (our observance of only this universe, compatible with our life) could occur.|$|E

40|$|Productivity {{is often}} {{computed}} by approximating the weighted {{sum of the}} inputs from the estimation of the Cobb-Douglas production function. Such estimates, however, may suffer from simultaneity and <b>selection</b> <b>biases.</b> Olley and Pakes (1996, Econometrica 64 : 1263 - 1297) introduced a semiparametric method {{that allows us to}} estimate the production function parameters consistently and thus obtain reliable productivity measures by controlling for such biases. This study first reviews this method and then introduces a Stata command to implement it. We show that when simultaneity and <b>selection</b> <b>biases</b> are not controlled for, the coefficients for the variable inputs are biased upward and the coefficients for the fixed inputs are biased downward.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} two <b>selection</b> <b>biases</b> {{that may affect}} the obesity-mortality link over the life course: mortality selection and healthy participant effects. If these selection mechanisms are stronger among obese adults than among non-obese adults, they {{may contribute to the}} weakening obesity-mortality link over the life course. We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988 - 2010 with linked mortality files from 1988 - 2011. We employed weighted Cox models to test and adjust for these two <b>selection</b> <b>biases.</b> We also used complementary log-log models, adjusted for a normal distribution of frailty, to test for mortality selection effects; accelerated failure-time models to mitigate the mortality selection effect; and ordinary least squares regression to test for healthy participant effects. The link between class II/III obesity and mortality weakens at older ages. We did not find evidence for significant mortality selection or healthy participant effects. Also, even if the healthy participant effects were stronger among obese adults, they are not strong enough to produce a weakening association between obesity and morbidity at higher ages {{at the time of the}} survey. Therefore, neither of these <b>selection</b> <b>biases</b> explains the diminishing effect of class II/III obesity on mortality over the life course...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of Markov models as deterioration-forecasting tools {{has been widely}} documented {{in the practice of}} infrastructure management. The Markov chain models employ monitoring data from visual inspection activities {{over a period of time}} in order to predict the deterioration progress of infrastructure systems. Monitoring data play a vital part in the managerial framework of infrastructure management. As a matter of course, the accuracy of deterioration prediction and life cycle cost analysis largely depends on the soundness of monitoring data. However, in reality, monitoring data often contain measurement errors and <b>selection</b> <b>biases,</b> which tend to weaken the correctness of estimation results. In this paper, the authors present a hidden Markov model to tackle <b>selection</b> <b>biases</b> in monitoring data. <b>Selection</b> <b>biases</b> are assumed as random variables. Bayesian estimation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation are employed as techniques in tackling the posterior probability distribution, the random generation of condition states, and the model's parameters. An empirical application to the Japanese national road system is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Estimation results highlight the fact that the properties of the Markov transition matrix have greatly improved in comparison with the properties obtained from applying the conventional multi-stage exponential Markov model...|$|R

25|$|Case-control {{studies are}} usually {{faster and more}} cost {{effective}} than cohort studies, but are sensitive to bias (such as recall bias and <b>selection</b> <b>bias).</b> The main challenge is to identify the appropriate control group; the distribution of exposure among the control group should {{be representative of the}} distribution in the population that gave rise to the cases. This can be achieved by drawing a random sample from the original population at risk. This has as a consequence that the control group can contain people with the disease under study when the disease has a high attack rate in a population.|$|E

25|$|Simply {{examining}} {{the performance of}} the best known value investors would not be instructive, because investors do not become well known unless they are successful.

In this speech, Buffett examined the performance of those investors who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation and were thus most influenced by Benjamin Graham. Buffett's conclusion is identical to that of the academic research on simple value investing strategiesâ€”value investing is, on average, successful in the long run.|$|E
