However, in 1920 the company started making the [...] "OK" [...] <b>silo</b> <b>filler</b> or stationary ensilage harvester. Immediately following its introduction the OK <b>silo</b> <b>filler</b> became very popular with the dairy farming market across the Upper Midwest of the United States. Sales of the OK soon made the Algoma Company a leading producer of silo fillers in the entire nation.|$|E
40|$|Many {{questions}} {{needed to}} advance {{our understanding of}} the mechanism of injury from high-level N 02, remain unanswered to date. This is partly due to the limited interest in the toxicity of high-level exposures, and partly due to the public pressure and interest to study the effects of low-(environmental) levels. However, the effects of exposure to high-level N 02 are of great interest to the military since high levels of N 02 may be found in combat situations. It is also important to the civilian sector in occupational settings were accidents may occur as in <b>Silo</b> <b>filler</b> accidents. To fill this gap in knowledge, the Department of Respiratory Research, Division of Medicine at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research took the initiative and convened a panel of experts in a symposium to discuss in depth the effects of exposure to high-level nitrogen dioxide. The symposium goals were to address the issues beginning from the chemistry of N 02 molecule, to the dosimetery of its uptake(isolated lung), to the biological effects of exposure in vivo in small animals (rats), large animals(sheep), and finally in the most relevant species, humans. 14.
