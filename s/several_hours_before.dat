5|$|Tropical Storm Dalila caused {{flooding}} in western Mexico in late July2007. The seventh tropical cyclone {{and the fourth}} named storm of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season, Dalila developed from a tropical wave located well southwest of Mexico on July22. Initially, northeasterly shear caused the depression to remain disorganized, though by early on July24, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dalila. During the next twenty-four hours, Dalila strengthened slightly further while tracking steadily northwestward, attaining peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) early on the following day. Shortly thereafter, Dalila either crossed or moved very close to Socorro Island on July25. Due to decreasing sea surface temperatures, the storm slowly began to weaken, after curving west-northwestward. Early on July27, Dalila was downgraded to a tropical depression, <b>several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> degenerating into a remnant low pressure area.|$|E

5|$|The 1899 Carrabelle {{hurricane}} caused {{significant damage}} in the Dominican Republic and the Florida Panhandle. The second tropical cyclone and second hurricane of the 1899 Atlantic hurricane season, the storm was first observed south of the Dominican Republic on July28, 1899. Shortly thereafter, it made landfall in Azua Province, Dominican Republic with an intensity equivalent to a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Early on July29, the system weakened to a tropical storm, shortly before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean. It then moved west-northwestward and remained at the same intensity for the next 24hours. The storm made landfall near Islamorada, Florida on July30. It then brushed Southwest Florida before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm began to re-intensify on July31 and became a hurricane later that day.

5|$|The {{following}} day, the RSMC Nadi upgraded Tropical Depression 04F to {{a tropical}} cyclone {{and gave it}} the name Tam, making it the first named storm of the 2005–06 season. Several hours later, the storm passed close to Niuafo'ou with winds of 65km/h (40mph). By 0000UTC on January13, the JTWC classified Tam as Tropical Cyclone 06P. Although the storm was tracking towards an area with stronger winds aloft, it was forecast to intensify. Due to the relatively fast movement of the storm, the increasing winds aloft {{had little effect on}} the storm, allowing it to intensify and attain winds of 85km/h (50mph) around 0600UTC. However, with both wind shear and the forward motion of the storm continuing to increase, convection rapidly became dislocated from the center. Around 0000UTC on January14, Tam entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand. With forward movement estimated at 75km/h (45mph) almost due south, the cyclone reached an unusually high latitude as a tropical cyclone. Coinciding with the time when Tam reached 33°S, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.

Before the tour could begin, Kiedis had an accident on his motorcycle and was rushed to the hospital after severely injuring his hand. Due to his drug addiction, it took seven doses of morphine before the pain was assuaged. Following discharge from the hospital, he was forced to wear a full-arm cast for several months, resulting in the cancellation of all remaining scheduled concerts. Halfway through Kiedis's recovery, the band was asked to play the Fuji Rock Festival in July 1997. By that time, Kiedis's cast had receded down to the elbow and he felt well enough to play. A large typhoon had been forecast to hit the festival <b>several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> the show.
