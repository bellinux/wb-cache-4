Results: In the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> of the sham-operated rat testes, many small lipid droplets were located close to the basement membrane of the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules.</b> But for the capsulotomized testes, the lipid droplets in the <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> had increased in size and number, with many lipid droplets migrated towards the lumen of the tubules.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Current study {{investigates the}} effects of {{maternal}} protein restriction during pregnancy and lactation on the testis of immature rats. Female Wistar rats were mated and, after confirming pregnancy, they {{were divided into two}} groups: undernourished group (UG) fed on a diet with casein 8 %, and control group (CG) fed on a diet with casein 17 %, during pregnancy and lactation. After weaning, male offspring from the two experimental groups were fed on normal diet up to 35 days old when they were euthanized. Body and testicular weights decreased in UG when compared to those in CG. Volumetric density of <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> was higher in CG whilst intertubular space increased in UG. The number of lumenated <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> was higher in CG than in UG. Tubular diameter, seminiferous epithelium height and total length of <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> were lower in UG. Round spermatids were frequently found in <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> cross-section of CG. On the other hand, spermatocytes I in prophases was the germ cell commonly found in <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> cross-sections of UG.

40|$|An {{approach}} combining two-dimensional {{gel electrophoresis}} and autoradiography was used to correlate pat-terns of secretory proteins in cultures of Sertoli and peritubular cells with those observed in the incubation medium from segments of <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules.</b> Sertoli cells in culture and in <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> secreted three proteins designated S 70 (Mr 72, 00070, 000), S 45 (Mr 45, 000), and S 35 (Mr 35, 000). Cultured Sertoli and peritubular cells and incubated <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> secreted two proteins designated SPI (Mr 42, 000) and SP 2 (Mr 50, 000). SPI and S 45 have similar Mr but differ {{from each other in}} isoelectric point (p 1). Cultured peritubular cells secreted a protein designated P 40 (Mr 40, 000) that was also seen in intact <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> but not in <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> lacking the peritubular cell wall. However, a large number of high-Mr proteins were observed only in the medium of cultured peritubular cells but not in the incubation medium of intact <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules.</b> Culture conditions influence the morphology and patterns of protein secretion of cultured peritubular cells. Peritubular cells that display a flat-stellate shape transition when placed in culture medium free of serum (with or without hormones and growth factors), accumulate various proteins in the medium that are less apparent when these cells are maintained in medium supplemented with serum.

40|$|The {{final step}} in the {{biosynthesis}} of testosterone is the reduction of androstenedione, which is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme 17 -ketosteroid reductase. Evidence is presented which {{suggests that there are}} two distinct 17 -ketosteroid reductases in rat testes, one in interstitial tissue and one in <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules.</b> The two enzymes have different pH optima, 5. 6 for the one from interstitial tissue and 6. 5 for the one from <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules.</b> At the optimum pH, a 70 -fold difference in Km values was observed, 17 [mu]M for the interstitial tissue enzyme and 0. 25 [mu]M for the enzyme from <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules.</b> Testosterone and metabolites of testosterone have very different effects on each of these enzyme activities. The interstitial tissue enzyme activity is inhibited by testosterone and several 5 [alpha]-reduced metabolites of testosterone and by estrogens. The most potent inhibitor of the steroids investigated was 5 [alpha]-androstane- 3 [alpha], 17 [beta]-diol, followed by 17 [beta]-estradiol [congruent with] dihydrotestosterone > testosterone > estrone > estriol. 5 [alpha]-Androstane- 3 [alpha], 17 [beta]-diol and 17 [beta]-estradiol were shown to act by competitive inhibition with apparent Ki values of 2. 2 and 3. 7 [mu]M, respectively. In contrast, it was demonstrated that among the above steroids, only dihydrotestosterone inhibits the 17 -ketosteroid reductase activity of <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules</b> and this inhibition was only observed at very high concentrations of inhibitor. Testosterone stimulated the 17 -ketosteroid reductase activity of <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules.</b> 5 [alpha]-Androstane- 3 [alpha], 17 [beta]-diol at low concentrations stimulated the enzyme activity from <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules,</b> while it had no effect at high concentrations. The remainder of the steroids tested had no effect on the 17 -ketosteroid reductase activity of <b>seminiferous</b> <b>tubules.</b> The difference in response of the two enzyme activities suggests a mechanism for local regulation of testosterone synthesis in each testicular compartment that does not involve directly pituitary gonadotropins...|$|R
