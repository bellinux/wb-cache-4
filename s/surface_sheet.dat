Escher, namely "Sphere Spirals" (1958) and "Bond of Union" (1956), showing spiral shaped surface sheets cut of a sphere and human head surfaces. These art works raise two questions: 1) How does one define a geometric model for a <b>surface</b> <b>sheet</b> of this type? 2) How does one visualize such geometric model? A <b>surface</b> <b>sheet</b> can be mathematically defined as a twodimensional manifold with boundary (or simply a 2 manifold).

Close to the Fermi level, the Cr- 3 d_z^ 2, d_xy, and d_x^ 2 -y^ 2 orbitals dominate the electronic states, and three bands cross E_F to form one 3 D Fermi <b>surface</b> <b>sheet</b> and two quasi- 1 D sheets. The electron DOS at E_F is less than 1 / 3 of the experimental value, indicating an intermediate electron renormalization factor around E_F.

Compared with BaFe_ 2 As_ 2, sizeable changes in the related Fermi <b>surface</b> <b>sheets</b> indicate significant electron transfer (about 0. 12 e) from Ti to Fe, which suppresses the stripe-like antiferromagnetism at the Fe sites and simultaneously induces superconductivity.

We argue here that this is due both to the inadequacy of certain approximations to the effective low-energy band structure, and to the natural near-degeneracy of different pairing channels in superconductors with many distinct Fermi <b>surface</b> <b>sheets.</b> In particular, we review attempts to construct two-orbital effective band models, the argument for their fundamental inconsistency with the symmetry of these materials, and the comparison of the dynamical susceptibilities in two- and five-orbital models. We then present results for the magnetic properties, pairing interactions, and pairing instabilities within a five-orbital Random Phase Approximation model. We discuss the robustness of these results for different dopings, interaction strengths, and variations in band structure. Within the parameter space explored, an anisotropic, sign-changing s-wave state and a d_x 2 -y 2 state are nearly degenerate, due to the near nesting of Fermi <b>surface</b> <b>sheets.</b> Comment: 17 pages, 23 figure...|$|R

40|$|LiFeAs {{is unique}} among the arsenic based Fe-pnictide superconductors {{because it is}} the only nearly {{stoichiometric}} compound which does not exhibit magnetic order. This is at odds with electronic structure calculations which and a very stable magnetic state and predict cylindrical hole- and electron-like Fermi <b>surface</b> <b>sheets</b> whose geometry suggests spin uctuations and a possible instability toward long-range ordering at the nesting vector. In fact, a complex magnetic phase-diagram is indeed observed in the isostructural NaFeAs compound. Previous angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) experiments revealed the existence of both hole and electron-like surfaces, but with rather distinct cross-sectional areas and an absence of the nesting that is thought to underpin both magnetic order and superconductivity in the pnictide family of superconductors. These ARPES observations were challenged by subsequent de Haas van Alphen (dHvA) measurements which detected a few, electron like Fermi <b>surface</b> <b>sheets</b> in rough agreement with the original band calculations. Here, we show a detailed dHvA study unveiling additional, small and nearly isotropic Fermi <b>surface</b> <b>sheets</b> in LiFeAs single crystals, which ought to correspond to hole-like orbits, as previously observed by ARPES. Therefore, our results conciliate the apparent discrepancy between ARPES and the previous dHvA results 5. The small size of these Fermi surface pockets suggests a prominent role for the electronic correlations in LiFeAs. The absence of gap nodes, in combination with the coexistence of quasi-two-dimensional and three-dimensional Fermi surfaces, favor a s-wave pairing symmetry for LiFeAs. But similar electron-like Fermi surfaces combined with very different hole pockets between LiFeAs and LiFeP, suggest that the nodes in the gap function of LiFeP might be located on the hole-pockets.

Comparison with the calculated Fermi surface of nonmagnetic CrB 2 suggests {{that two of}} the observed dHvA oscillations arise from electron-like Fermi <b>surface</b> <b>sheets</b> formed by bands with strong B-px,y character which should be rather insensitive to exchange splitting. The measured effective masses of these Fermi <b>surface</b> <b>sheets</b> display strong enhancements of up to a factor of two over the calculated band masses which we attribute to electron-phonon coupling and electronic correlations. For the temperature and field range studied, we do not observe signatures reminiscent of the heavy d-electron bands expected for antiferromagnetic CrB 2.

40|$|Recently, a {{test for}} a sign-changing gap {{function}} in a candidate multiband unconventional superconductor involving quasiparticle interference data was proposed.

The calculation was performed for a single impurity, however, raising the question of how robust this measure is as a test of sign-changing pairing in a realistic system with many impurities. Here we reproduce the results of the previous work within a model with two distinct Fermi <b>surface</b> <b>sheets,</b> and show explicitly that the previous result, while exact for a single nonmagnetic scatterer and also in the limit of a dense set of random impurities, can be difficult to implement for a few dilute impurities.
