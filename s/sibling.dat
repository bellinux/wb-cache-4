5|$|Parents of {{children}} with ASD {{have higher levels of}} stress. Siblings {{of children}} with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected <b>sibling</b> than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings {{of children with}} Down syndrome in these aspects of the <b>sibling</b> relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer <b>sibling</b> relationships as adults.|$|E

Rædwald used the letters R and E when naming two of his own sons, (as did his own father when he and his younger brother Eni were named), which {{suggests}} that Eorpwald was the younger <b>sibling</b> and would only have become Rædwald's heir after his elder brother Rægenhere was slain in battle in 616.|$|E

5|$|The best attested <b>sibling</b> of Heraclius the Younger {{was arguably}} Theodore. Maria, sister of Heraclius the Younger, is {{mentioned}} by Nikephoros I and identified as mother of Martina, whom Heraclius the Younger {{would go on}} to marry. It should be noted, however, that both Kedrenos and Michael the Syrian consider Martina to have been a daughter of an unnamed brother of Heraclius the Younger, thus casting some doubt on the precise relation. Finally, Theophanes briefly mentions another Gregoras as a brother of Heraclius the Younger {{on the occasion of the}} former's death at Heliopolis (modern Baalbek) circa 652/653. This is the only mention of this <b>sibling.</b> Theophanes, however, might have misunderstood the relation between Gregoras and the emperor.|$|E

5|$|If {{there is}} a halo effect {{spreading}} to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters.

5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles {{and expectations of}} being a good parent, <b>sibling,</b> or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, <b>sibling</b> and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate the emotions of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements. Family affects us significantly on this psychological level – {{the level at which}} advertisements are most effective.|$|E
