5|$|On 21 February 2007, a Class 73 derailed {{after hitting}} an {{avalanche}} between Hallingskeid and Myrdal on the Bergen Line. The accident {{raised questions about}} the class's abilities to handle hard snow, such as in avalanches. In particular, a DNV report from 1999 had shown that the train could act as a sled, lose contact with the tracks and slide on top of the snow. A former NSB employee who worked with route planning, stated that a locomotive-hauled train would be better suitable for such situations, because more of the weight is located {{at the front of the}} train, and it will therefore plow instead of slide. The National Rail Administration said that they took extra precautions for the Class 73 trains and that during snowfall they would run a <b>snow-clearing</b> unit ahead of all Class 73 runs. NSB stated that they would consider the possibility of reverting to conventional trains, but that unless new information could shed light on the situation, they would retain use of the Class 73 trains.|$|E

Rainfall is moderate, but on average it rains less than 10 days per month. The prevailing wind is south-westerly.

Alaska's voting age of 19, less than most other states' 21, played a role in his decision, as did its newness and cooler climate. Broke when he arrived, he immediately found work in real estate sales until winter arrived. Gravel then was employed as a brakeman for the Alaska Railroad, working the <b>snow-clearing</b> train on the Anchorage-Fairbanks run. Subsequently, he opened a small real estate brokerage in Anchorage (the Territory of Alaska not requiring a license) and saved enough so as not to have to work the railroad again.

500|$|From 1951 to 1952, he toured Ireland {{with the}} Anew McMaster {{repertory}} company, playing {{over a dozen}} roles. In 1952, he began acting in regional English repertory productions; from 1953 to 1954, {{he worked for the}} Donald Wolfit Company, at the King's Theatre, Hammersmith, performing eight roles. From 1954 until 1959, Pinter acted under the stage name David Baron. In all, Pinter played over 20 roles under that name. [...] To supplement his income from acting, Pinter worked as a waiter, a postman, a bouncer, and a <b>snow-clearer,</b> meanwhile, according to Mark Batty, [...] "harbouring ambitions as a poet and writer." [...] In October 1989 Pinter recalled: [...] "I was in English rep as an actor for about 12 years. My favourite roles were undoubtedly the sinister ones. [...] They're something to get your teeth into." [...] During that period, he also performed occasional roles in his own and others' works for radio, TV, and film, as he continued to do throughout his career.|$|R

The inclement weather failed to relent, forcing organisers to deploy <b>snow-clearing</b> machinery at the finish, {{in a bid to}} run the stage at its full length. Ultimately, their bid to do so was futile as race organisers could not guarantee a safe finish into Port Ainé, a ski station in the Pyrenees. The finish was moved to a point on the lower slopes of Port del Cantó, and thus eliminating any opportunity for the main field to contest for the stage victory; the twelve-man breakaway were just [...] away from the point as {{the decision was made to}} do so.|$|E

5000|$|Based on {{the earlier}} Class DD13 6th-batch locomotives, the Class DD14 was a single-end-cab design with a rotary {{snowplough}} {{unit at the}} cab end. It was the first diesel-powered rotary snowplough built by JNR. The locomotives had two [...] diesel engines. One engine {{could be used for}} propulsion with the other driving the rotary snowplough unit, giving a <b>snow-clearing</b> capacity of approximately 3,000 tonnes per hour, or the unit could be operated in multiple with a second locomotive allowing both engines to drive the rotary snowplough, giving a <b>snow-clearing</b> capacity of approximately 4,000 tonnes per hour.|$|E

50|$|In 1923, the {{brothers}} Hans and Even Øveraasen of Norway constructed an early snowplow {{for use on}} cars. This {{proved to be the}} start of a tradition in <b>snow-clearing</b> equipment for roads, railways and airports, as well as the foundation of the company Øveraasen Snow Removal Systems. Carl Frink of Clayton, New York, USA was also an early manufacturer of automobile-mounted snowplows. His company, Frink Snowplows, now Frink-America, was founded by some accounts as early as 1920.|$|E
50|$|Urban design {{features}} that {{may appear to}} be simple conveniences for persons without disabilities are often essential to anyone who has a disability. The loss of these features presents a significant barrier. For example, sometimes a lack of prompt <b>snow-clearing</b> on sidewalks of major Canadian city streets means that wheelchair and walker users cannot reach pedestrian crossing buttons on crosswalk posts, due to snow bank accumulation around the posts, making the crossing buttons inaccessible. Public services must take into account the need to maintain accessibility features in the urban environment.|$|E
50|$|Since {{there are}} no (public) roads to Finse, the railway {{provides}} the sole means of transportation to and from Finse. During summer, however, {{it is possible to}} walk or cycle to Finse on the Rallarvegen road (owned by the railroad). Across the railway line from the station is housed the railway navvy museum, which has exhibits on the construction of the railway line and two decommissioned <b>snow-clearing</b> engines which you are free to explore. The area also has a hotel (Finse 1222), a hostel (Finsehytta, DNT), and many private cabins.|$|E

50|$|The next {{were five}} 'streamlined' diesel {{locomotives}} from General Electric, which were equipped with matching passenger cars, acquired from 1939 onward. These slowly supplanted the steam locomotives, though some steam operations persisted until the 1960s as backup power and {{to operate the}} <b>snow-clearing</b> train (where their greater weight meant they {{were less likely to}} derail). A number of the steam locomotives are now on static display, in Manitou and elsewhere, and the Railway still has an operational steam locomotive (#4) and an original coach. The steam locomotive was put out of service for many years before being retrieved from a museum and brought back to service in 1980.|$|E

5000|$|The City of San Francisco {{is remembered}} for the {{blizzard}} in the Sierra Nevada that trapped the train {{for six days}} in January 1952 at [...] 17 miles (27 km) west of Donner Pass at Yuba Pass on Track #1 adjacent to Tunnel 35 (on Track #2), at about MP 176.5. Snow drifts from 100 mph (160 km/h) winds blocked the train burying it in 12 feet of snow and stranding it from January 13 to 19. The event made international headlines. In the effort to reach the train, the railroad's <b>snow-clearing</b> equipment and snow-blowing rotary plows became frozen to the tracks near Emigrant Gap. Hundreds of workers and volunteers, including escaped German POW Georg Gärtner, using snowplows, tractors and manpower {{came to the rescue}} by clearing nearby Route 40 to reach the train. The 196 passengers and 20 crewmembers were evacuated within 72 hours, on foot to vehicles that carried them the few highway miles to Nyack Lodge. The train itself was extricated three days later on January 19.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{situations}} regarding the snow-removal system in rural areas through a case study of Kuriyama-town in Hokkaido. Heavy snow in the winter of 2010 / 2011 created severe damage in many districts along the Sea of Japan. Many elderly people were killed in accidents resulting from snow-removal work, and the road network came to a halt due to the delay in snow-removal operations by public authorities. Snowy areas overlap rural areas that are already facing a declining and aging population. This aging of the population means there are fewer available residents fit enough to engage in snow removal, likewise the decrease in the population xxx will cause difficulties with respect to public <b>snow-clearing</b> operations and mutual support for such residents. The problem of removing snow from public roads is connected with the depression of the construction industry, one of the key industries in rural areas, and also the financial problems of local governments. In this paper, we analyze the situation related to the snow-removal system in Kuriyama-town. In general, the snow-removal system is based on public authorities clearing public roads and residents clearing the areas around their own houses. In addition, there are local snow-removal systems in rural areas operated mainly by farmers using farm machinery, which is performed as a social service for elderly residents and also as a substitute service for public-authority operations. We discuss the problems of such a system as affected by changing conditions and the direction of reform of the existing system and alternative options...|$|E
