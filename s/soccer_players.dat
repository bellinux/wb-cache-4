5|$|When Rocky was {{diagnosed}} with brain damage, {{it must be noted}} that many athletes have a form of brain damage including football players, <b>soccer</b> <b>players,</b> and other individuals in contact sports such as rugby, etc. Rocky never went for a second opinion and yielded to his wife's wishes to stop.

By today's standards Rocky Balboa would be given a clean bill of health for fighters.|$|E

5|$|Nash grew {{up playing}} soccer—he stated in a 2005 {{interview}} {{that he could have}} played professionally if he had focused on it—and continues to hold an interest in the sport. When Dirk Nowitzki arrived in the NBA from Germany, he and Nash became close friends, in part because they enjoyed watching soccer together.

5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} women <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> of all time, and by many as the best ever, Hamm was an athletic, dynamic, and technically gifted striker, renowned for her speed, skill, footwork, stamina, and ability on the ball, as well as her consistency. An excellent, agile dribbler, she was highly regarded for her control, as well as her grace, pace, and elegance in possession. A prolific goalscorer, she was known for her powerful and accurate striking ability, although she was also a creative and hard-working forward, and a team player, who was equally capable of assisting many goals for her teammates, due to her accurate passing, and was also willing to aid her teammates defensively when possession was lost. She was capable of playing in any offensive position.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} the October meeting, JG50 was disbanded and its {{personnel}} absorbed into I./Jagdgeschwader 301, a Wilde Sau night-fighter unit. While operational, JG 50 had claimed 45 Allied four-engined bombers. Graf was promoted to Oberst (Colonel) and on 11 November, appointed Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of JG11, when Mader was transferred to JG54 in the Leningrad sector. Aside from Grislawski, who was kept on as Staka (the squadron commander) of 1./ JG1, he managed to take his <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> and friends with him. Sunday 20 February marked the start of ”Big Week” – six consecutive days of concentrated bombing by the USAAF designed to overwhelm the German defences. JG11 was heavily involved and Graf shot down a B-24 Liberator for his 208th victory on the 24 February. His 209th aerial victory, west of Berlin on 6 March, was over another B-24 Liberator, of the 453d Bombardment Group. It was actually an Herausschuss (separation shot) – a severely damaged heavy bomber forced to separate from its combat box and which the Luftwaffe counted as an aerial victory. On 29 March, Graf shot down two P-51 Mustangs that were making a fighter sweep ahead of their bomber stream. Chased and harried {{by the rest of}} their squadron, he tried to ram another before bailing out. Landing heavily, he broke both knees and fractured his arm. These would prove to be his final air victories. Prompt attention from the JG11 medic saved Graf from losing his arm. From April to early July he spent time recovering in a hospital in his home-town of Engen. On June 24, he married Jobst, whom he had been seeing over the past year.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{there are}} no {{regulations}} at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that {{is close to the}} outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf. Surface variations can {{have a significant effect on}} how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.|$|E
