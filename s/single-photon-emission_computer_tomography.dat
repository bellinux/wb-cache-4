40|$|Background: The {{molecular}} {{and cellular}} mechanisms {{corresponding to the}} compensatory and maladaptive hypertrophy and remodeling of the left ventricle with chronic doxorubicin (DOX) treatment are currently unclear. Non-invasive methods of determining these changes are still deficient. To investigate these changes, 8 groups of rats in 4 different studies including a control saline group of the same age, gender and strain were evaluated for cardiac morphology and function including: (1) DOX dose response using a cumulative dose of 7. 5 mg/kg, and 15 mg/kg in 8 - 10 week old female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, (2) strain differences were investigated {{in response to a}} cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg in 8 - 10 week old female Fisher (F 344) rats compared to the SD rats treated with same dose, (3) the role of gender and aging were studied in response to DOX at a cumulative dose of 3 mg/kg in male and female neonates, and (4) combined losartan and a cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg of DOX in 8 - 10 week old female SD rats compared to controls of saline and 15 mg/kg treated SD rats. Method: Onset of cardiac toxicity was assessed by echocardiography and the rat model of heart failure was developed when the fractional shortening declined &# 8804; 40 %. The mean arterial pressure and <b>single-photon-emission</b> <b>computer</b> <b>tomography</b> scanning and Tc- 99 m-HYNIC-Annexin V were performed at week 10 to analyze blood pressure and quantify apoptosis, respectively. All rats were euthanized at week 10 except for the neonates and two of the 7. 5 mg/kg-treated SD rats that were left alive for study of long -term cardiac side effects. The heart and kidney tissues were harvested for protein isolation and histopathological studies. Blood samples were collected for hematological and lipid profile analysis in all the rats. Results: A dose- and time-dependent increase in LVmass coincided with a parallel increase in MAP, kidney damage, expression of myocardial erbB 2, heat shock protein 90 Akt, mTOR, GSK- 3 &# 946;, TGF-&# 946;, pSMAD 2, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in SD rats treated with 7. 5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg of DOX at week 10. The 7. 5 kg/kg treatment showed adaptive hypertrophy whereas the 15 mg/kg treatment group showed maladaptive hypertrophy. However decompensation was apparent by week 14 in other rats treated with 7. 5 mg/kg. LVmass, FS, MAP, kidney damage, red blood cells and blood lipid levels were not significantly altered in the F 344 rats compared to the 15 mg/kg-treated SD rats. Losartan supplementation reduced the left ventricular hypertrophy, improved myocardial contractility, and reduced TGF-&# 946; expression compared to the DOX-treated SD rats. The 3 mg/kg of DOX in neonates induced cardiac toxicity and deaths in about 60 % of males 50 weeks after treatment; the females instead developed mammary tumors. Conclusion: The {{results of this study suggest}} that age, gender, and strain differences are risks factors for doxorubicin-induced harmful reno-cardiovascular toxicity. The inhibition of TGF-&# 946; expression by losartan can be used in prevention of chronic doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity without interfering with its anti-tumor activities...|$|E

The efficacy of <b>Computer</b> <b>Tomography</b> was evaluated using the Spearman correlation coefficient.

40|$|Lower {{gastrointestinal}} hemorrhage {{presents a}} common indication for hospitalization and account for over 300000 admissions {{per year in}} the United States.

Method: 3 D reconstructed <b>computer</b> <b>tomography</b> of 30 males and 30 females were analyzed. The three craniometric points were located and marked on both side of the 3 D skull and the measurement was done by advanced post processing techniques. The area of mastoid triangle was calculated by means of the Heron’s formula. Total area calculated was done by adding the areas (mm 2) obtained on each side. Result: From this study the areas of the male Mastoid is 828. 532 ± 118. 54 which is greater than female Mastoid which is 577. 502 ± 71. 22 (t test value 9. 943 and P Value 001).
