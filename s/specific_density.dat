5|$|Saturn is a gas giant {{because it}} is {{predominantly}} composed of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it may have a solid core. Saturn's rotation causes it to have {{the shape of an}} oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10%: 60,268km versus 54,364km. Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less. Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average <b>specific</b> <b>density</b> of the planet is 0.69g/cm3 due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times the Earth's mass, and Saturn is 95 times the mass of the Earth. Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.|$|E
25|$|The {{power output}} of {{biodiesel}} {{depends on its}} blend, quality, and load conditions under which the fuel is burnt. The thermal efficiency for example of B100 as compared to B20 will vary due to the differing energy content of the various blends. Thermal efficiency of a fuel is {{based in part on}} fuel characteristics such as: viscosity, <b>specific</b> <b>density,</b> and flash point; these characteristics will change as the blends as well as the quality of biodiesel varies. The American Society for Testing and Materials has set standards in order to judge the quality of a given fuel sample.|$|E
500|$|The {{spermaceti}} organs {{may also}} help adjust the whale's buoyancy. It is hypothesized that before the whale dives, cold water enters the organ, {{and it is likely}} that the blood vessels constrict, reducing blood flow, and, hence, temperature. The wax therefore solidifies and reduces in volume. The increase in <b>specific</b> <b>density</b> generates a down force of about [...] and allows the whale to dive with less effort. During the hunt, oxygen consumption, together with blood vessel dilation, produces heat and melts the spermaceti, increasing its buoyancy and enabling easy surfacing. However, more recent work has found many problems with this theory including the lack of anatomical structures for the actual heat exchange.|$|E

2500|$|One misconception, {{particularly}} in older research publications, {{is that the}} vagina is completely insensitive. However, there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive. With regard to <b>specific</b> <b>density</b> of nerve endings, while the area commonly described as the G-spot may produce an orgasm, and the urethral sponge, {{an area in which}} the G-spot may be found, runs along the [...] "roof" [...] of the vagina and can create pleasurable sensations when stimulated, intense sexual pleasure (including orgasm) from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris. The greatest concentration of vaginal nerve endings are at the lower third (near the entrance) of the vagina.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} of Airy's researches was his determination of the mean density of the Earth. In 1826, the idea occurred to him of attacking this problem by means of pendulum experiments at {{the top and bottom of}} a deep mine. His first attempt, made in the same year, at the Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, failed in consequence of an accident to one of the pendulums. A second attempt in 1828 was defeated by a flooding of the mine, and many years elapsed before another opportunity presented itself. The experiments eventually took place at the Harton pit near South Shields in 1854. Their immediate result was to show that gravity at the bottom of the mine exceeded that at the top by 1/19286 of its amount, the depth being 383m (1,256ft) From this he was led to the final value of Earth's <b>specific</b> <b>density</b> of 6.566. This value, although considerably in excess of that previously found by different methods, was held by Airy, from the care and completeness with which the observations were carried out and discussed, to be [...] "entitled to compete with the others on, at least, equal terms." [...] The currently accepted value for Earth's density is 5.5153 g/cm³.|$|E

In addition, as drivers of nutrient recycling, viruses may support mat regeneration and productivity. Our study shows that the intertidal photosynthetic microbial mats in Schiermonnikoog have high viral abundances, reaching densities of 0.05 to 5.4 × 1010 viruses g− 1. The observed abundances of viruses in the mats are more than 10 -fold higher those typically recorded in marine sediments (Danovaro et al. 2008 a). Such high viral abundances have only been reported for eutrophic estuarine sediments with high microbial activity (Hewson et al. 2001; Helton et al. 2012). An earlier study of abundances in lagoon microbial mat also showed high abundances (~ 15 × 1010  g− 1 dry weight) (Pacton et al. 2014). In this study the data was presented as dry weight <b>specific</b> <b>densities</b> (Pacton et al. 2014). Converting the wet weight <b>specific</b> <b>densities</b> obtained in our study to the corresponding densities per gram dry weight using an average water content (42 and 26  % corresponding to 0 – 1 and 1 – 2  mm layers, respectively; this study), showed equally high viral (0.2 – 20 × 1010  g− 1) and prokaryotes (0.2 – 7.3 × 1010  g− 1) abundances in the top 0 – 2  mm of the Schiermonnikoog mats.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Active {{surveillance}} {{to manage}} prostate cancer provides {{an alternative to}} immediate treatment in men with low risk prostate cancer. We report updated outcomes from a long-standing active surveillance cohort and factors associated with reclassification. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data on all men enrolled in the active surveillance cohort at our institution with at least 6 months of followup between 1990 and 2013. Surveillance consisted of quarterly prostate specific antigen testing, repeat imaging with transrectal ultrasound at provider discretion and periodic repeat prostate biopsies. Factors associated with repeat biopsy reclassification and local treatment were determined by multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. We also analyzed the association of prostate <b>specific</b> antigen <b>density</b> and outcomes stratified by prostate size. Results: A total of 810 men who consented {{to participate in the}} research cohort were followed on active surveillance for a median of 60 months. Of these men 556 (69 %) met strict criteria for active surveillance. Five-year overall survival was 98 %, treatment-free survival was 60 % and biopsy reclassification-free survival was 40 %. There were no prostate cancer related deaths. On multivariate analysis prostate <b>specific</b> antigen <b>density</b> was positively associated with the risk of biopsy reclassification and treatment while the number of biopsies and time between biopsies were inversely associated with the 2 outcomes (each p < 0. 01). When stratified by prostate volume, prostate <b>specific</b> antigen <b>density</b> remained significantly associated with biopsy reclassification for all strata but prostate <b>specific</b> antigen <b>density</b> was only significantly associated with treatment in men with a smaller prostate. Conclusions: Significant prostate cancer related morbidity and mortality remained rare at intermediate followup. Prostate <b>specific</b> antigen <b>density</b> was independently associated with biopsy reclassification and treatment while on active surveillance...|$|R
