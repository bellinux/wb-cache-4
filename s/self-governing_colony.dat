5|$|Having been governed and {{developed}} by the British South Africa Company since the 1890s, Southern Rhodesia became a <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony</b> within the British Empire in 1923, when it was granted responsible government by Whitehall. The Southern Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, was henceforth empowered to run its own affairs in almost all matters, including defence. Foreign affairs {{was one of the}} few areas reserved by the British government. As the Empire's lone <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony,</b> Southern Rhodesia was considered a sui generis case, almost on a par with a dominion. Starting in 1932, Imperial Conferences included the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister alongside those from the dominions, a unique situation which continued after Imperial Conferences were superseded by Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences in 1944.|$|E
5|$|After the Wind of Change of {{the early}} 1960s, the British {{government}} under Harold Wilson and the predominantly white minority government of the <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony</b> of Rhodesia, led by the Prime Minister Ian Smith, were unable to agree terms for the latter's full independence. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence on 11 November 1965. This was deemed illegal by Britain and the United Nations (UN), each of which imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Douglas-Home {{accepted}} the foreign affairs portfolio in Heath's shadow cabinet. Many expected {{this to be}} a short-lived appointment, a prelude to Douglas-Home's retirement from politics. It came at a difficult time in British foreign relations: events in the <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony</b> of Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia), which had been drifting towards crisis for some years, finally erupted into open rebellion against British sovereignty. The predominantly white minority government there opposed an immediate transfer to black majority rule before the colony had achieved sovereign statehood, and in November 1965 it unilaterally declared independence. Douglas-Home won the approval of left-wing Labour MPs such as Wedgwood Benn for his unwavering opposition to the rebel government, and for ignoring those on {{the right wing of the}} Conservative party who sympathised with the rebels on racial grounds.|$|E
50|$|The Colonial Conference of 1897 was {{a conference}} between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the 11 <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> of the British Empire. The conference was convened in London by Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain in 1897 on the {{occasion}} of Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Chamberlain's intention was to draw the <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> into closer co-operation with the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|The {{growth of}} the British Empire in the 19th century, to its {{territorial}} peak in the 1920s, saw Britain acquire nearly {{one quarter of the}} world's land mass, including territories with large indigenous populations in Asia and Africa. From the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, the larger settler colonies - in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa - first became <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> and then achieved independence in all matters except foreign policy, defence and trade. Separate <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> federated to become Canada (in 1867), Australia (in 1901), South Africa (in 1910), and Rhodesia (in 1965). These and other large <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> had become known as Dominions by the 1920s. The Dominions achieved almost full independence with the Statute of Westminster (1931).|$|R

5|$|Southern Rhodesia's {{contributions}} to the Imperial war effort helped it to become regarded by Britain as more mature and deserving of responsible government, which Whitehall granted in 1923. The territory was made a <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony,</b> just short of full dominion status. Charged with its own defence, Salisbury introduced the selective conscription of white males in 1926, and reformed the Rhodesia Regiment the following year. The territory's association with the King's Royal Rifle Corps endured {{in the form of}} affiliation between the KRRC and the Rhodesia Regiment's new incarnation, which adopted aspects of the KRRC uniform and a similar regimental insignia. The new Rhodesia Regiment was granted the original's World War I battle honours and colours by George V in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia, then a <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony</b> of the United Kingdom, entered World War II {{along with}} Britain {{shortly after the}} {{invasion}} of Poland in 1939. By the war's end in 1945, 26,121 Southern Rhodesians of all races {{had served in the}} armed forces, 8,390 of them overseas, operating in the European theatre, the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre, East Africa, Burma and elsewhere. The territory's most important contribution to the war is commonly held to be its contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), under which 8,235 British, Commonwealth and Allied airmen were trained in Southern Rhodesian flight schools. The colony's operational casualties numbered 916 killed and 483 wounded of all races.|$|E
5|$|The monarchy of Barbados has {{its roots}} in the English monarchy, under the {{authority}} of which the island was claimed in 1625 and first colonized in 1627, and later the British monarchy. By the 18th century, Barbados became one of the main seats of the British Crown's authority in the British West Indies, and then, after an attempt in 1958 at a federation with other West Indian colonies, continued as a <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony</b> until, on 30 November 1966, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly formed monarchy of Barbados. The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of Barbados, Sir Elliott Belgrave.|$|E

25|$|The {{alteration}} {{in status}} was stirred by a sentiment {{on the part}} of the prime ministers of the <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> of the British Empire that a new term was necessary to differentiate them from the non-self-governing colonies. At the 1907 Imperial Conference, it was argued that <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> that were not styled ‘dominion’ like Canada, or ‘commonwealth’ like Australia, should be designated by some such title as ‘state of the empire’. After much debate over lexicon, the term ‘Dominion’ was decided upon.|$|R

5|$|The {{southern}} African {{territory of}} Rhodesia, officially Southern Rhodesia, {{was a unique}} case in the British Empire and Commonwealth—though a colony in name, it was internally self-governing and constitutionally not unlike a dominion. This situation dated back to 1923, when it was granted responsible government within the Empire as a <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony,</b> following three decades of administration and development by the British South Africa Company. Britain had intended Southern Rhodesia's integration into the Union of South Africa as a new province, but this having been rejected by registered voters in the 1922 government referendum, the territory was moulded into a prospective dominion instead. It was empowered to run its own affairs in almost all respects, including defence.|$|E
5|$|Archimedes {{was born}} c. 287BC in the seaport city of Syracuse, Sicily, {{at that time}} a <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony</b> in Magna Graecia, located {{along the coast of}} Southern Italy. The date of birth is based on a {{statement}} by the Byzantine Greek historian John Tzetzes that Archimedes lived for 75 years. In The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an astronomer about whom nothing is known. Plutarch wrote in his Parallel Lives that Archimedes was related to King Hiero II, the ruler of Syracuse. A biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heracleides but this work has been lost, leaving the details of his life obscure. It is unknown, for instance, whether he ever married or had children. During his youth, Archimedes may have studied in Alexandria, Egypt, where Conon of Samos and Eratosthenes of Cyrene were contemporaries. He referred to Conon of Samos as his friend, while two of his works (The Method of Mechanical Theorems and the Cattle Problem) have introductions addressed to Eratosthenes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of World War I (also known as the First World War or the Great War), Southern Rhodesia was {{administered}} by the British South Africa Company, which had controlled it and Northern Rhodesia since acquiring them through diplomacy and conquest during the 1890s. The white population in Southern Rhodesia stood at 23,606 in 1911 (a minority of 3%), while Northern Rhodesia had about 3,000 white settlers (less than half of 1%). With the Company's charter due to expire in late 1914, most Southern Rhodesian public attention was focused on this issue before the outbreak of war. The settlers were split between those who backed continued administration by the Chartered Company and those who advocated responsible government, which would make Southern Rhodesia a <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony</b> within the British Empire. Still others favoured the integration of Southern Rhodesia into the Union of South Africa, which had been formed in 1910. Following {{the intervention of the}} war, the charter was renewed for 10 years in early 1915.|$|E
50|$|Delegates {{were sent}} to the conference by Canada, Newfoundland Colony, New Zealand the Australian <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia, and the South African colonies of Cape Colony and the Colony of Natal.|$|R

From the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, the larger settler colonies– in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa– first became <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> and then achieved independence in all matters except foreign policy, defence and trade. Separate <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> federated to become Canada (in 1867), Australia (in 1901), South Africa (in 1910), and Rhodesia (in 1965). These and other large <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> had become known as Dominions by the 1920s. The Dominions achieved almost full independence with the Statute of Westminster (1931).Through a process of decolonisation following the Second World War, most of the British colonies in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean gained independence. Some colonies became Commonwealth realms, retaining the British monarch as their own head of state. Most former colonies and protectorates became member states of the Commonwealth of Nations, a non-political, voluntary association of equal members, comprising a population of around 2.2billion people.|$|R
50|$|In 1901 the six British <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia {{united to}} form the Commonwealth of Australia, with almost {{complete}} control of its internal affairs, but with foreign policy and defence handled by London.|$|R
5|$|Most of the UK's Caribbean territories {{achieved}} independence {{after the}} departure in 1961 and 1962 of Jamaica and Trinidad from the West Indies Federation, established in 1958 {{in an attempt}} to unite the British Caribbean colonies under one government, but which collapsed following the loss of its two largest members. Barbados achieved independence in 1966 and the remainder of the eastern Caribbean islands in the 1970s and 1980s, but Anguilla and the Turks and Caicos Islands opted to revert to British rule after they had already started on the path to independence. The British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands and Montserrat opted to retain ties with Britain, while Guyana achieved independence in 1966. Britain's last colony on the American mainland, British Honduras, became a <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony</b> in 1964 and was renamed Belize in 1973, achieving full independence in 1981. A dispute with Guatemala over claims to Belize was left unresolved.|$|E
5|$|When World War II {{broke out}} in 1939, the {{southern}} African territory of Southern Rhodesia had been a <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony</b> of the United Kingdom for 16 years, having gained responsible government in 1923. It was unique in the British Empire and Commonwealth in that it held extensive autonomous powers (including defence, but not foreign affairs) while lacking dominion status. In practice, it acted as a quasi-dominion, and was treated as such {{in many ways by}} the rest of the Commonwealth. Southern Rhodesia's white population in 1939 was 67,000, a minority of about 5%; the black population was a little over a million, and there were about 10,000 residents of coloured (mixed) or Indian ethnicity. The franchise was non-racial and in theory open to all, contingent on meeting financial and educational qualifications, but in practice very few black citizens were on the electoral roll. The colony's Prime Minister was Godfrey Huggins, a physician and veteran of World War I (1914–18) who had emigrated to Rhodesia from England in 1911 and held office since 1933.|$|E
25|$|John Forrest was {{the only}} premier of Western Australia as a <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony.</b> Following the Federation of Australia in 1901, Western Australia became an Australian state and the {{responsibilities}} of the office of premier were diminished.|$|E
50|$|The best-known {{examples}} of <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> are the Dominions, during the mid-to-late-19th century and early 20th century. In the Dominions, {{prior to the}} Statute of Westminster in 1931, a Governor General, officially the monarch's representative, was a de facto arm of the British government.|$|R
50|$|<b>Self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> for {{the most}} part have no formal {{authority}} over constitutional matters such the monarchy and the constitutional relationship with Britain. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in London, serves as the ultimate avenue of appeal in matters of law and justice.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{formation}} of the Commonwealth in 1901, the six Australian <b>colonies</b> were <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies,</b> with parliaments which had come into existence at various times between 1825, when the New South Wales Legislative Council was created, to 1891, when Western Australia became the last of the colonies to gain full self-government.|$|R
25|$|George Peter Walls {{was born}} in Salisbury, {{the capital of the}} British <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony</b> of Southern Rhodesia in 1927.

25|$|In 1907 New Zealand's {{status was}} officially {{transformed}} from <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony</b> to dominion.

25|$|Near {{the end of}} {{his rule}} as governor, Douglas was criticized for not {{developing}} the colony as a self-governing body. His only such political reform had been to initiate an elected Legislative Council. His argument against the creation of a <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony</b> was the state of the population: few were British subjects, most held permanent residence within the colony, and of those few owned property.|$|E

50|$|All <b>self-governing</b> British <b>colonies</b> {{were invited}} to send delegates with the {{exception}} of Newfoundland Colony. Western Australia and Natal Colony did not send representatives due to domestic priorities. The colony of Fiji was also invited due to its geographical location on the proposed route of the cable but declined. Delegates were sent to the conference by Canada, New Zealand, the Australian <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria and the South African colony of Cape Colony. Unlike other colonial conference, the colonial delegates were cabinet ministers or legislators or government representatives rather than Prime Ministers.|$|R
50|$|Imperial Conferences (Colonial Conferences before 1907) were {{periodic}} {{gatherings of}} government {{leaders from the}} <b>self-governing</b> <b>colonies</b> and dominions of the British Empire between 1887 and 1937, before the establishment of regular Meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in 1944. They were held in 1887, 1894, 1897, 1902, 1907, 1911, 1921, 1923, 1926, 1930, 1932 and 1937.|$|R
25|$|New Zealand {{became a}} <b>self-governing</b> <b>colony</b> in 1853 {{following}} {{the passage of}} the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, which established responsible government in the colony.
