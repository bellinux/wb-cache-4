50|$|Sun is in South Korea, {{set up on}} a date by a matchmaker, {{and finds}} her {{prospective}} suitor, Jae Lee, to be wealthy, educated, and charming. Meanwhile, Jin is preparing for an important job interview at a hotel. His roommate, using {{what appears to be}} the I Ching, tells him that Jin will find love soon, adding cryptically that its color will be orange. Jin's interviewer, Mr. Kim, berates Jin as a bumpkin villager who stinks of fish, but then hires him as a doorman anyway, with a stern warning that Jin is not to open the door to anyone like himself. Sun and Jae continue to hit it off, and the pair schedule a meeting at the hotel where Jin is working and which Jae's family owns. Sun heads for the entrance of the hotel, but Jin fails to see her because he is bowing as he opens the door for her. Inside, Jae suddenly reveals that he plans to marry a woman he met in America, and has been seeing Sun only to placate his parents. Although she is obviously disappointed, Sun wishes him well and leaves. A poorly dressed father with a young boy approaches the hotel, and asks Jin for permission to enter, as the boy urgently has to go to the bathroom. Jin reluctantly lets the pair inside, but Mr. Kim observes this, and gives him a stern dressing-down, again insulting his background. Jin quits on the spot. Later, wandering along a bridge, Jin passes a woman in an orange dress. Looking back wistfully, he <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> amusement, and turns around. He collides directly with Sun, thus meeting his future wife for the first time.|$|E

30|$|The club {{physician}} {{made the}} final diagnosis of concussion based on conventional clinical examination techniques. For every CIR activation, cases were reviewed for a medically diagnosed concussion using the Observational Review and Analysis of Concussion (ORAC) Form {{to record the}} game circumstances and detail the suspected injury and {{the presence or absence}} of the six concussive signs [8]. The ORAC Form was created to provide a simple but standardized framework for coding and analyzing video footage of the game situations and consequences of concussion events in rugby league [8]. In summary, the six signs included the following: (i) clutch or shake head: the player holds his head or face in the palm of his hand or hands, or the player rubs or <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> a manner that appears to demonstrate that he is experiencing discomfort; (ii) slow to return to feet/play: player took longer than usual to return to his feet (e.g., remained on the ground, got to his knees or to his haunches, and waited momentarily before standing); (iii) gait ataxia (wobbly legs): unable to stand steadily unaided or walk normally. Upon standing and walking, the player has unsteadiness, wobbly legs, balance problems, stumbles or falls over, or cannot walk straight independently; (iv) blank/vacant stare: the player is not visually focused on the doctor/trainer when being spoken to or assessed and asked to attend, and/or the player appears to be looking off into the distance; (v) evidence of unresponsiveness: the player’s body goes limp, the player does not protect (i.e., brace) himself when falling. The player remains/lies motionless on the ground for a period of time longer than expected, or the player shows a lack of visible responsiveness to verbal stimuli. The sign was recorded as present even if the player exhibited behavior that met the criteria for only 1  sec; and (vi) post-impact seizure or possible seizure: tonic posturing—stiffening of limbs or convulsions [9]. The inter-rater reliability (IRR) for each of these signs has been previously reported [4, 6]. The reported IRR for two expert raters for each sign was clutch or shake head, slow to get up, and post-impact seizure = 1.00; unresponsiveness = 0.84 (95 % CI: 0.70 – 0.94); gait ataxia = 0.77 (95 % CI: 0.63 – 0.90); and blank stare = 0.65 (95 % CI: 0.44 – 0.84) [4].|$|E
