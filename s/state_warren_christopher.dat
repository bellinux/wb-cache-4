5|$|In 1992, the Croat-Bosniak {{conflict}} {{erupted in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina, just as each was {{fighting with the}} Bosnian Serbs. The war was originally fought between the Croatian Defence Council and Croatian volunteer troops {{on one side and}} the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) on the other, but by 1994, the Croatian Army had an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 troops involved in the fighting. Under pressure from the United States, the belligerents agreed on a truce in late February, followed by a meeting of Croatian, Bosnian, and Bosnian Croat representatives with US Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Christopher</b> in Washington, D.C. on February 26, 1994. On March 4, Franjo Tuđman endorsed the agreement providing for the creation of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and an alliance between Bosnian and Croatian armies against the Serb forces.|$|E

50|$|The {{foreign policy}} of the Bill Clinton {{administration}} was the {{foreign policy of}} the United States from 1993 to 2001 under the Administration of President Bill Clinton. Clinton's main foreign policy advisors were Secretaries of <b>State</b> <b>Warren</b> M. <b>Christopher</b> and Madeleine Albright and National Security Advisors Anthony Lake and Sandy Berger.|$|R
25|$|Villaraigosa placed {{first in}} the primary for the Los Angeles mayoral {{election}} of March 8, 2005, and won the run-off election on May 17, receiving 58.7% of the vote. On July 1, 2005, Villaraigosa {{was sworn in as}} the 41st Mayor of Los Angeles. He became the first Latino Mayor of Los Angeles since 1872, when Cristóbal Aguilar (who served from 1866–68 and again from 1870–72) held the office. Attendees to his first inauguration included then Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger; former Governors Gray Davis, Pete Wilson, and Jerry Brown; former Vice President Al Gore, U.S. Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Christopher,</b> and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.|$|E
25|$|President Jimmy Carter {{appointed}} Owen {{to be the}} U.S. State Department Legal Adviser in 1979. A {{few weeks}} after Owen took office, the Iran hostage crisis began in November 1979. In 1980, Owen argued {{on behalf of the}} United States in its case against Iran before the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Owen also participated in negotiations with Iranian representatives in Algiers in late 1980 and early 1981 {{as a member of the}} team led by Deputy Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Christopher.</b> Owen played a role in drafting the Algiers Accords that led to the January 1981 release of the U.S. embassy personnel being held captive in Tehran.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{official}} police and security sector discussions, the U.S. was undertaking some independent training and equipment donations, though the programs—mainly organized by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)—were not explicitly detailed to the international community. Lia writes that covert contacts and counter-terrorism collaboration between the PLO and the CIA had been ongoing in the 1970s and throughout the Lebanese Civil War in the 1980s but were not favored in the Reagan and Bush administrations. After the Oslo accords, the Clinton Administration revived covert ties and intelligence training. In January 1994 media sources reported that PLO officials and bodyguards were traveling to the U.S. to receive training {{as a result of}} an agreement between Arafat and U.S. Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Christopher.</b> Publicly, the U.S. was ambivalent regarding support for police and security sector activities. The Gaza–Jericho Agreement between the PLO and Israel signed on May 4, 1994 increased U.S. interest in coordinating public international efforts to fund the PLO police who were to deploy into Gaza and Jericho. The day after the treaty was signed, the U.S. announced a $5 million grant for the PLO police and they worked to encourage other nations to donate flexible funds for the same purpose.|$|E
50|$|A genuine {{crisis in}} transatlantic {{relations}} blew up over Bosnia. London and Paris resisted relaxation of the UN arms embargo, and discouraged US escalation, arguing that arming the Muslims or bombing the Serbs could worsen the bloodshed and endanger their peacekeepers on the ground. US Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Christopher's</b> campaign {{to lift the}} embargo was rebuffed by Major and President Mitterrand in May 1993. After the so-called 'Copenhagen ambush' in June 1993, where Clinton 'ganged up' with Chancellor Kohl to rally the European Community against the peacekeeping states, Major {{was said to be}} contemplating the death of the special relationship. The following month the United States voted at the UN with non-aligned countries against Britain and France over lifting the embargo.|$|R
50|$|In January 1993, Clinton {{appointed}} W. Anthony Lake as his National Security Adviser. Lake, {{a former}} Foreign Service officer, served under Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's National Security Adviser, and {{as director of}} the Department of State Policy Planning Staff during the Carter administration. During the Carter years, Lake had witnessed the negative effects of bureaucratic infighting and squabbling between then Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. As Clinton's National Security Adviser, Lake was effective in maintaining cordial relations with Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>Warren</b> M. <b>Christopher</b> and in developing an atmosphere of cooperation and collegiality. Lake initially maintained a low public profile, avoiding public appearances and television interviews, so as not to upstage the Secretary of State as Kissinger had done in the Nixon administration. In September 1993, however, in response to criticism that the Clinton administration had not adequately explained its foreign policy, Lake began to appear as a public speaker.|$|R
