It does so by putting centre stage {{the notion of a}} ‘bipolar <b>second</b> <b>person</b> relation’, and examining ways of giving it substance suggested by the authors of these papers. In particular, it focuses on claims made (and denied) in these papers (a) about the existence and/or nature of <b>second</b> <b>person</b> thought, <b>second</b> <b>person</b> reasons for action and <b>second</b> <b>person</b> reasons for belief and (b) about possible connections among thought-theoretical, ethical and epistemological issues and debates in this area. ...|$|R

5000|$|Family {{members and}} friends speak to one another using the <b>second</b> {{singular}} <b>person</b> sen, and adults use sen to address minors. In formal situations (meeting people for the first time, business, customer-clerk, colleagues) plural second-person siz is used almost exclusively. In very formal situations, double plural second-person sizler {{may be used to}} refer to a much-respected person.

In the imperative, there are three forms: <b>second</b> <b>person</b> singular for informal, <b>second</b> <b>person</b> plural for formal, and double plural <b>second</b> <b>person</b> for very formal situations. Thus, the imperative forms of the verb gelmek, [...] "to come", are gel (<b>second</b> <b>person</b> singular, informal), gelin (<b>second</b> <b>person</b> plural, formal), and geliniz (double <b>second</b> <b>person</b> plural, very formal and not frequently used) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{instances}} of <b>second</b> <b>person</b> narration {{in the first}} journal published in The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath (Kukil, 2000) {{in order to determine}} the potential that <b>second</b> <b>person</b> narration can have for the linguistic representation of mental states. The contributions of different disciplines (narratology, linguistics, psychology) to the study of <b>second</b> <b>person</b> narration are considered and their findings are re-applied to a non-fictional text. In a corpus-informed comparative analysis, the paper takes into consideration both perspectives from narratology and developments in the understanding of language use in the field of psychology to provide an interdisciplinary, but cognitively inclined perspective on the phenomenon. Appearances of <b>second</b> <b>person</b> narration are chronologically tracked through the data and compared to biographical developments in Sylvia Plath's life; entries written in the first- and <b>second</b> <b>person</b> are compared to each other to determine linguistic differences using corpus methods; the results of the two analyses are then interpreted in the light of traditional functions attributed to <b>second</b> <b>person</b> narration in narratology, and in the light of research in narrative psychology. The paper aims to demonstrate that <b>second</b> <b>person</b> narration can project a sense of emotional depth and inner conflict as well as of emotional balance.
