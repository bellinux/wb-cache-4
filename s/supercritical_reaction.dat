40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track II: Transportation and BiofuelsNon-catalytic supercritical transesterification {{provides a}} new way of producing biodiesel fuel from bio-based oils (triglycerides). When the supercritical fluid (SCF) is used as a reaction medium, a small change in the pressure near the critical point of the fluid causes a significant change in density-dependent properties such as the solubility parameter, mass transfer, viscosity, and dielectric constant. Some unique advantages for conducting chemical reactions in SCF are: (1) reaction rates, yields, and selectivity can be adjusted by varying pressure and temperature; (2) environmentally-benign SCF such as supercritical CO 2, H 2 O, and alcohol can be used instead of undesirable solvents; (3) mass transfer is improved for heterogeneous reactions; and (4) simultaneous separation and reaction may be accomplished for some reactions. Compared to conventional transesterification processes catalyzed by alkali or acid catalyst, the non-catalytic SCF method does not require the post-refining process for the removal of the catalyst.

40|$|The {{combination}} of reaction calorimetry and supercritical fluids as reactants and/or solvent holds {{great potential for}} the optimization of chemical processes using high pressure near-critical and/or supercritical mixtures. The very specific properties of supercritical fluids and fluid mixtures have been under investigation already from {{the nineteenth century and}} some are quite well understood. But there is still a lack of knowledge in macroscopic properties and raw data for pure fluids and fluid mixtures. This cumulates with the difficulty to apply simple equations of state for the prediction of phase behavior and the calculation of the thermodynamic and the derived transport properties. As a whole, the relatively poor engineering information about supercritical fluids {{is one of the major}} reasons that explains the slow industrial development of supercritical processing. The work presented here concerns the complete development of the new "supercritical reaction calorimetry field", which is in fact the application of reaction calorimetry to supercritical fluids media. As far as we know we are pioneers in this domain as only relatively small scale calorimeters have been successfully used with SCFs and only scarcely. The fact is that the use of reaction calorimetry provides essential information for scale-up purposes. Moreover it allows additional in-line equipment to be used, in order to get complementary information. This renders the reaction calorimeter much lesser specialized and potentially attractive as a tool for industrial application developments. In order to correctly position this project in the scale of laboratory and industrial researches, the first chapter is dedicated to the review of SCFs and SCF mixtures properties, their potential as volatile organic solvent relievers and their actual industrial applications. As a result there is still a great need in engineering data for pure SCFs and their mixtures, although their unique properties make them suitable for several processes, mostly driven by environmental considerations. Classical reaction calorimetry is also shortly discussed with the determination of the technical challenge that arose from the use of a supercritical fluid, as it basically occupies all the available space. Thus we point out that both cover and flange should be separately controlled and adjusted to the inner temperature in order to avoid side heat transfer from the reaction media to those elements. Moreover, the regulation parameters for the jacket and the additional cover and flange should be optimized. This has proved to be difficult as these parameters have been shown to depend strongly on the supercritical carbon dioxide pairs, density and temperature. Nevertheless satisfactory pairs of P, I parameters for all three parts of the reactor have been found using the Ziegler-Nichols approach for the jacket and a pure trial-and-error approach for the two others. The heat transfer with SCFs should be carefully taken into account in order to proceed with correct chemical reactions' evaluation. Heat transfer in scCO 2 and CO 2 -methanol mixtures can be described in stirred tank reactors using the well known Wilson plot methods. The behavior of the internal film heat transfer coefficient with the temperature is drastically different from the one observed for classical liquid systems. In contrast to classic liquids, in supercritical CO 2, the lower the temperature (above the critical point) the higher the internal film heat transfer coefficient. It shows a clear divergence when approaching the critical point. This tendency could be explained by the evolution of the thermodynamical and transport properties of scCO 2 around the critical point. This confirms some observations in the literature with some continuous flow heat transfer apparatuses working with SCFs. The heat transfer coefficients for the cover and the flange have been evaluated and show the same general tendency as the one of the jacket in regard to the temperature. The hydrodynamics of scCO 2 in a stirred tank reactor have been investigated using Laser Doppler Anemometry measurements and indicating that the stirred scCO 2 has a similar behavior with liquid water. However, the turbulent kinetic energy and the mean velocities are 20 % lower for scCO 2, which can be explained by its lower density. Information about the phase behavior during a reaction is essential in order to proceed homogeneously. Under this condition, the system allows for higher reaction rates and for easier process control. This has motivated the complementary development of a video imaging surveillance system for the inside of the reactor, as well as the development of a high pressure variable-volume view cell for the screening of mixtures' phase behavior. As the "top-view" observation is not ideal for phase change observation (no meniscus visualisation), the further development of an in-situ high pressure ultrasonic probe is also provided in this work. Sound speed measurements have been proven to be not only useful as a "phase-change" detector, but also allowed determining the critical point of pure fluids and mixtures. This work also pointed out the real difficulty to combine a homogeneous <b>supercritical</b> <b>reaction</b> media to a sufficiently high heat produced signal. To access the limit of detection of the calorimetric system and to find out the characteristic time constant of the reactor and its variation with temperature and density, we created an amplifier system based on a Labview® interface program. Using some defined functions for the calibration heater released heat, it has been possible to simulate some typical reaction curves and thus validate the heat flow measurements with the <b>supercritical</b> <b>reaction</b> calorimeter...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted {{to the study of the}} {{dispersion}} polymerization of methyl methacrylate in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2), using a poly(dimethylsiloxane) macromonomer (PDMS macromonomer) as stabilizer. Supercritical fluids (SCF) and SCF mixtures are characterized by a temperature and a pressure above their critical point(s), which is the last point on the vaporization line of a pure component. This means that these fluids operate from moderate to high pressure. They can be used in various processes ranging from extractions, nanoparticle formation for controlled drug release, chemical reactions and polymer processing. Nowadays, the best candidate for SCF processing is carbon dioxide. The fundamental motivation of using scCO 2 as a solvent is based on its potential to replace harmful chemical organic volatile compounds (VOCs) in order to develop more sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical processes. At this point, the crucial role of CO 2 in the development of the so-called "green chemistry" comes on the stage. CO 2 is a natural abundant compound with low toxicity exhibiting no inflammability. This last property is very advantageous considering the cost investments spent by the chemical industry to control the safety of the chemical processes using highly flammable compounds like VOC solvents. As expected, environmental arguments are not sufficient to motivate the development of new chemical process routes. Therefore, additional arguments to use SCFs have to be found, and they do exist. As supercritical fluids are compressible fluids they can exhibit liquid-like and gas-like properties, which can be tuned easily by varying the operating conditions, like pressure and temperature. This fundamental behavior of SCF is their main asset and demonstrates their superiority to develop more flexible processes. The polymer industry is one of the industries that uses the largest volumes of organic solvents and sometimes halogenated ones, well known to destroy the ozone layer. The use of scCO 2 gives to chemists and engineers the opportunity to develop more sustainable polymer processes, considering the numerous chemical and physical advantages of carbon dioxide. The processing of scCO 2 for polymer production is no more than fifteen years-old. This means that a certain quantity of knowledge has been acquired but still a lot of unknowns hinder their promotion at industrial level. This work is inserted in this context and finds there its main motivations. This thesis is composed of two different but intrinsically connected approaches of the dispersion polymerization of the methyl methacrylate (MMA) in scCO 2. A part of this thesis {{is devoted to}} the development of techniques allowing the on-line monitoring of polymerizations in scCO 2 at "larger" scale, conducted from an engineering approach. The intrinsically connected part {{is devoted to the}} understanding of the fundamental phenomena that govern the dispersion polymerization of MMA in scCO 2, its kinetic features and the product characteristics of the polymer produced, being conducted from a chemical approach of the subject. Up to now, most of the studies dealing with polymerization reactions in scCO 2 are realized in small autoclaves between 2 and 60 ml allowing pertinent fundamental analysis but with poor similarities with an industrial reactor. A keystone of this work is the development of a <b>supercritical</b> <b>reaction</b> calorimeter composed of a 1. 3 liters high pressure reactor allowing the kinetic study of the dispersion polymerization, which in turn gives a direct insight into the parameters that control the dispersion polymerization stability, efficiency and mechanism. Based on an adapted heat balance, the calorimeter can give the profile of monomer conversion (thermal conversion). Furthermore, the volume of the reactor allows inserting on-line sensors inside the reactor. This possibility led to the development of an ultrasonic sensor to monitor the polymerization process. The combination between the calorimetric information and the sensor signal shows the potential of these sensors to monitor polymerization reactions in scCO 2. By measuring the speed of sound evolution during the course of the polymerization, it is possible to calculate the composition of the medium and thus evaluate the monomer conversion. The analysis of the effects of temperature, stirring speed and impeller types demonstrate that the dispersion polymerization of MMA can be effective under a wide range of operating conditions using the PDMS macromonomer as stabilizer. The experiments point out that the stability of the dispersion polymerization and in turn the rate of polymerization, the polymerization loci 1 and the polymer quality depend strongly on the stabilizer concentration but more fundamentally on its degree of solubility in the carbon dioxide. Phase behavior measurements demonstrate that the 5 ' 000 g/mol PDMS macromonomer exhibits a relative good solubility in carbon dioxide and that this solubility can be greatly improved by the presence of the monomer in the mixture. In fact, the monomer acts as a cosolvent for the PDMS macromonomer improving the solvency of the scCO 2 (polarity, density). This study demonstrates that the concentration of the monomer in the reacting medium is a key parameter to control the stability of the dispersion throughout the polymerization process. A dispersion polymerization is characterized by polymer-rich particles dispersed in a continuous phase, i. e. the CO 2 -rich continuous phase. The results give evidence of the fact that the polymerization can take place in both phases depending on the concentration of stabilizer and its solubility in the reacting medium. In this case, bimodal molecular weight distributions and intermediate rate of polymerization are observed. When only one reaction locus is active, monomodal molecular weight distributions are obtained. Furthermore, the locus of the polymerization influences directly the rate at which the polymer is produced and the degree of polymerization. In order to complete the study, a model has been developed demonstrating that diffusion limitations are operative in the dispersion polymerization of MMA in scCO 2. A gel effect is present in the polymer-rich phase that leads to the increase of the molecular weight of the polymer produced, as observed also experimentally. Moreover, the presence of this gel effect occurring inside the polymer-rich particles explains the auto-acceleration of the polymerization rate as the conversion increases. The model demonstrates that in the case of an effective dispersion polymerization of the methyl methacrylate in scCO 2 the main reaction loci are the polymer-rich particles. ______________________________ 1 A dispersion polymerization is composed of polymer-rich particles dispersed in the CO 2 -rich continuous phase.

From the above-mentioned viewpoint, the synergistic effect of combining electric pulsed plasma and supercritical fluids is expected as a new reaction process which may be able to enhance chemical reaction without using any catalysts. In this research, production of protein-like substance by pulse electric discharge plasma was carried out using amino acid in supercritical carbon dioxide. Moreover, nano pulse electric discharge plasma was also formed in <b>supercritical</b> fluids; <b>reaction</b> of amino acid was also observed. Aiming at establishment of a new reaction field, we did fusion research of supercritical fluids and electric discharge plasma. In this experiment, argon at the pressurized state was used as a reaction medium. Initially, alanine aqueous solution of 0. 1 mol/L was loaded to a plasma reactor (inner volume: 600 mL) and reached under the desired conditions (290 - 308 K and 1 - 10. 8 MPa).

40|$|Catalytic {{deactivation}} {{caused by}} coking was studied in zeolite Y and ZSM 5 during 1 -hexene isomerization under subcritical and supercritical conditions. The effects of varying temperature and pressure, from 220 to 250 °C and from 10 to 70 bar, respectively, on conversion and coke deposition were studied in both zeolites. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS), and nitrogen sorption isotherms for fresh and coked catalysts were compared. In zeolite Y an exponential decay in conversion was observed with {{the rate of}} deactivation being slower at supercritical conditions at 235 °C and 40 bar than subcritical conditions at 235 °C and 10 bar. It is thought that in zeolite Y the micropores with diameter 7. 4 Å could accommodate coke molecules leading to the observed deactivation; however, in ZSM 5 the micropores of 5. 3 – 5. 6 Å diameter were too small to accommodate coke molecules, and thus coke was deposited outside the zeolite crystals within the mesopores of the alumina binder. Although zeolite Y deactivated, while ZSM 5 did not, {{the use of a}} <b>supercritical</b> fluid <b>reaction</b> environment enabled the conversion at 235 °C, 40 bar to be maintained at 42 % over zeolite Y, which was higher than the conversion of 34 % over ZSM 5 catalyst under the same conditions. Operating with supercritical fluid led to the partial alleviation of the significant coking effects observed with zeolite Y and improved its viability for use in this reaction compared with the performance of ZSM 5...|$|R
40|$|The slow yet steady {{expansion}} of the global economies, {{has led to an}} increased demand for energy and fuel, which would eventually lead to shortage of fossil fuel resources in the near future. Consequently, researchers have been investigating other fuels like biodiesel. Biodiesel refers to the monoalkyl esters which can be derived {{from a wide range of}} sources like vegetable oils, animal fats, algae lipids and waste greases. Currently, biodiesel is largely produced by the conventional route, using an acid, a base or an enzyme catalyst. Drawbacks associated with this route result in higher production costs and longer processing times. Conversely, supercritical transesterification presents several advantages over conventional transesterification, such as, faster reaction rates, catalyst free reaction, less product purification steps and higher yields. This work focused on the supercritical transesterification of cooking oil, soybean in particular. The experimental investigation was conducted using methanol at supercritical conditions. These conditions were milder in terms of pressure than those reported in literature. A batch setup was designed, built and used to carry out the <b>supercritical</b> transesterification <b>reactions.</b> The biodiesel content was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to calculate reaction yields. Methyl ester yield of 90 % was achieved within 10 minutes of <b>reaction</b> time using <b>supercritical</b> transesterification. A maximum yield of 97 % was achieved with this process in 50 minutes of reaction time. Two key factors, temperature and molar ratio were studied using variance analysis and linear regression and their significance on the biodiesel yield was determined. The kinetic tendency of the reaction was investigated and the values of rate constants, activation energy and the pre-exponential factor were estimated...|$|R

Utilizing reactants which resemble the organic nitrogen containing components of coal, we propose to develop a method to tailor chemical <b>reactions</b> in <b>supercritical</b> fluid solvents for the specific application of coal denitrogenation. The Diels - Alder reaction of anthracene and 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 4 -triazoline- 3, 5 -dione (PTAD) was chosen as the model system and was investigated in supercritical carbon dioxide. During this quarter, measurement of the density dependence of the kinetic rate constant for PTAD and anthracene in supercritical solvents was continued. Having completed studies of rates versus density in pure CO{sub 2 } at 40 C, attention was focused on CO{sub 2 }/Cosolvent mixtures. Experiments were performed using binary mixtures of CO{sub 2 } and either chloroform or acetone as cosolvent. Cosolvent concentrations were varied between 0. 00826 mol/L and 0. 0826 mol/L. The cosolvents produced no significant change in the rate constant over that of pure CO{sub 2 } at these concentrations...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of biofeul has recently become attractive {{as an alternative}} resource for carbon-containing fuels (fossil fuel). One of the methods to produce boifuel {{is the use of}} supercritical methanol for biodiesel production. It has recently been proven to be a successful medium for carrying out transesterification reactions. The transesterification products of vegetable oil are fatty acid ester (biodiesel) and glycerol. The most commonly used first order kinetics model has been compared with simultaneous second order kinetics model using experimental data of transesterification of rapeseed oil. The rate constants for the two models have been numerically evaluated solving ordinary nonlinear differential equations. The transesterification data characterized with 42 : 1 molar ratio of methanol to rapeseed oil were analysed for the reaction temperatures range from 270 to 380 C under <b>supercritical</b> conditions. The <b>reaction</b> mechanism of non-catalytic transesterification of vegetable oils with supercritical methanol is explained by a series of different reaction steps to produce biodiesel.

Kinetic data have been previously collected for pure CO 2 at 40 C and pressures between the critical pressure of CO 2 (73. 8 bar) and 216 bar. These data support the theory of local density enhancements suggested in the literature. Data taken at 50 C and pressures ranging from 70 bar to 195 bar are currently reported; they do not exhibit the molecular clustering evident closer to the critical temperature. The data taken at 40 C are now being used to construct mathematical forms which can model these pressure-induced kinetic changes.

40|$|Poster presentato a Euronanoforum, Trieste (I), 9 - 12 dicembre 2003. - Numerous supecritical fluids (SCF) {{techniques}} {{have been proposed}} to produce microparticles. They {{have been developed to}} overcome the limits of traditional micronization techniques in which it is problematic or impossible, to produce micronic or submicronic particles using jet milling, ball milling and liquid antisolvent crystallization. For these applications, carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) is the most common SCF choice. For different industrial fields (such as semiconductors, drug release systems, catalysts) it has been used in several techniques, among the others: -	RESS technique, based on the solubilization of a solid to be micronized in SC-CO 2 and its subsequent precipitation by fast depressurization of the formed solution: -	SAS technique, based on the use of SC-CO 2 as antisolvent to precipitate a solid solute from a liquid solution; -	SSI technique, based on the impregnation of a polymer matrix by a solute released from a <b>supercritical</b> solution; -	<b>Reaction</b> in SF media technique, based on a reaction (hydrolysis) in SF-CO 2 to produce nanosized materials -	Drying technique, based on a sol-gel synthesis to produce mesoporous materials followed by SC-CO 2 drying.

40|$|Lithium iron {{phosphate}} (LiFePO 4) is {{a promising}} cathode material for lithium ion batteries {{because it can}} be synthesized from low cost starting materials, it is relatively non-toxic (compared with LiCoO 2 or LiNiO 2), and because it is intrinsically stable at potentials greater than 3. 45 V [1]. The solid-state synthesis of LiFePO 4 has therefore received much attention. However, this process is costly and very time-consuming since it involves at least four steps [2] and leads to relatively large particles (average size greater than 30 µm) [3]. This work reports new hydrothermal routes for the synthesis of nanoparticles of lithium ion phosphate. The hydrothermal synthesis has been carried out in batch as well as continuous reactors, and at subcritical as well as <b>supercritical</b> (solvent) temperatures. <b>Reaction</b> temperature, pH, residence time, and reactant concentrations were adjusted to investigate their effect on particle characteristics such as size, size distribution, specific surface area, and morphology. The particles were characterized using optical and XRD, XPS, SEM, and TEM methods. In general, submicron and nanoparticles of uniform size and shape could be obtained at both subcritical and supercritical temperatures, and neutral pH. Particles of higher crystallinity, which is expected to be beneficial in battery applications, could be obtained at supercritical temperatures and at higher residence times in the continuous process.
