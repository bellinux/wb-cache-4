5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2006–07 season, Gannon and Stockport announced they had drawn up a five-year plan to take the club to the Championship. Results on the field followed this <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent,</b> with Gannon leading County to a League record nine consecutive victories without conceding a goal. Gannon lodged a complaint with The Football Association against Bristol Rovers when a fixture was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch, as he felt not enough was done to ready the pitch, and also a complaint with regard to the referee's handling of the situation. Gannon was later incensed with the FA when the same referee was allowed to take charge of the postponed fixture, which Rovers won 2–1. Gannon also branded approaches from Manchester City and Liverpool questionable and unprofessional after the two Premier League clubs swooped for youngsters being trained in Stockport County's development squads.|$|E

Although Yorkshire were unable to progress past the Group stages of the T20 Blast, they sealed their 32nd County Championship title with a game to spare with victory over Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on 12 September 2014.

500|$|Along with {{introducing}} the band's new sound, the song opens the album as a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent.</b> Lyrically, new anticipations and appetites are suggested ("I'm ready for what's next"), as is {{a willingness to}} throw caution to the wind and take risks ("I'm ready {{to let go of}} the steering wheel"). Some of the lyrics, particularly those in the bridge before the final chorus, use the eponymous subway station as a metaphor for time: [...] "Time is a train / Makes the future the past / Leaves you standing in the station / Your face pressed up against the glass". Bono cites the enjoyment of his first child born in 1989 as a major influence on Achtung Baby, as was his wife's second pregnancy during the album's 1991 recording. Bono says babies influenced the lines from the first verse, [...] "I'm ready to say I'm glad to be alive / I'm ready, I'm ready for the push".|$|E
500|$|As {{is often}} the case on U2 albums, Bono is {{credited}} as the sole lyricist. In contrast to U2's previous records, whose lyrics were politically and socially charged, Achtung Baby is more personal and introspective, examining love, sexuality, spirituality, faith, and betrayal. The lyrics are darker in tone, describing troubled personal relationships and exuding feelings of confusion, loneliness, and inadequacy. Central to these themes was the Edge's separation from his wife (the mother of his three children), which occurred halfway through the album's recording. The pain not only focused him on the record and led him to advocate more personal themes, but it also affected Bono's lyrical contributions. Bono found inspiration from his own personal life, citing the births of his two daughters in 1989 and 1991 as major influences. This is reflected in [...] "Zoo Station", which opens the album as a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> with lyrics suggesting new anticipations and appetites.|$|E

Chris Kee of Zero Tolerance Magazine said that [...] "getting Flemming Rasmussen to produce [...] {{is a major}} coup and as you'd expect he's done a sterling job, these fine songs all being blessed with a clean, crisp, uncluttered sound", whereas Ian Webster of Terrorizer felt that [...] "booking a band into Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen to record their debut with legendary Metallica producer Flemming Rasmussen is {{one hell of a}} <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> from Earache."

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Cheo H. Coker at Rolling Stone called the album Shakur's best {{and said it}} was [...] "by and large a work of pain, anger and burning desperation [...] is the first time 2Pac has taken the conflicting forces tugging at his psyche head-on". Jon Pareles, writing in The New York Times, called Shakur the [...] "St. Augustine of gangster rap" [...] due to his ambivalence towards the behavior and nature of the gangster lifestyle. In a negative review, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice felt that Shakur is [...] "witless" [...] when dealing with fundamental hip hop themes of persecution and accused him of [...] "self-pity": [...] "The subtext of his persecution complex is his self-regard". [...] "This may be the first hip-hop blues LP," [...] observed Matt Hall in Select. [...] "Not so much in the music, although the harp blasts owe more to Howlin' Wolf than Tupac's previous two solo efforts, but more with Shakur's vocals, which are at once rebellious and resigned... Me Against the World is a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent,</b> a note from the depths of America, and a fine, thoughtful LP." ...|$|E
500|$|Opening track [...] "The Classical" [...] {{acts as a}} <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> {{similar to}} that in [...] "Crap Rap 2/Like to Blow" [...] from the Fall's debut album Live at the Witch Trials. Whereas on the earlier song Smith {{described}} himself as [...] "Northern white crap that talks back", in the opening lines of Hex Enduction Hour he complains that the fact that contemporary music lacks culture is his [...] "brag", observing that a [...] "taste for bullshit reveals a lust for a home of office" [...] and references [...] "obligatory niggers", before accusingly shouting [...] "Hey there, fuckface, hey there, fuckface". Pavement released a less offensive, sanitised cover of the track in the early 1990s, and Smith dismissed them later as mere Fall copyists. [...] "Jawbone and the Air Rifle" [...] depicts a nightmarish folklore tale of a poacher (described as a [...] "rabbit killer") bored by a decades-old marriage who escapes by roaming the local countryside at night hunting prey. One night the protagonist [...] "lets out a misplaced shot", which draws the Hex of the [...] "Broken Brothers Pentacle Church". The song's main focal point is toward the end when the lyrics detail a series of semi-religious, semi-pagan horrific and repeating hallucinations.|$|E

[...] The estimated purchase price, according to the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent,</b> was for the acquisition using RICK stock {{to be at a}} value of US$2.20 to US$3.80 per share. The US$45 million deal fell through after the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> expired on March 31, 2010, with Rick's Cabaret unable to enter into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of VCG's outstanding stock.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Utrecht University (FVMU) has {{introduced}} major curriculum changes {{to keep pace with}} modern veterinary educational developments worldwide. Changes to program outcomes have been proposed according to professional and societal demands, with more attention paid to generic competencies and electives and species/sector differentiation. Furthermore, changes in educational approaches and the educational organization have been proposed, aiming at a transition from teacher-centered education toward more student-centered education. Curriculum development is a complex and difficult process, with many elements interacting. For a new curriculum to become valid, curriculum elements and their interrelation-such as <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> (also called outcomes, goals, or objectives), content, teaching and learning strategies, assessment strategies, and context-need to be addressed in the educational philosophy (i. e., the intended curriculum). This paper describes a document analysis of the major curriculum reforms of the FVMU. Curriculum committee reports were critically analyzed to gain insight into the intentions of the curriculum designers and the match between the curriculum elements, as described by Prideaux. The results show that the reports paid considerable attention to generic competency training, especially to academic training, and to the introduction of more student-centered teaching and learning strategies. However, little attention was paid to assessment strategies and the <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> were defined rather broadly. Curriculum evaluation (i. e., what is delivered to the students and how is the curriculum experienced) is needed at all curriculum levels. Possible mismatches between levels need to be identifie...|$|R
