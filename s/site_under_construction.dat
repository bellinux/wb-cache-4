There are practically no tennis facilities for the disabled {{and part of the}} development of the club would address this issue in North Lincolnshire. Detailed and lengthy submissions were made to the Sports Aid Foundation, the National Lottery, the Football Trust and Foundation for Sports and the Arts. Support for the bid was forthcoming from the LTA and a huge redevelopment of the Club started in August 2003. The development, costing £250,000 saw the whole <b>site</b> <b>under</b> <b>construction</b> work. All of the courts were replaced; four synthetic grass courts so enjoyed by players of all abilities, two floodlit acrylic courts as used in the US Open, which are especially good for wheelchair tennis, and a state of the art Club House with ample luxurious accommodation.|$|E

This plan gradually grew into an ambitious scheme to bring along {{a group of friends}} and turn their adventures into a road movie, taking inspiration from Jack Kerouac's On the Road. As more Pranksters volunteered for the trip they soon realized they had outgrown Kesey's station wagon, so Kesey bought a retired yellow school bus for $1,250 from Andre Hobson of Atherton, California. The license plates read [...] "MAZ 804". Hobson had already added bunks, a bathroom, and a kitchen with refrigerator and stove for taking his 11 kids on vacation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Seismic {{excitation}} of linearly elastic structures is {{dealt with}} in the paper. It is well known that dynamical structural response is very sensitive to random fluctuations of the excitation; the consequence is that the identification of the forcing function {{on the basis of a}} few global parameters does not allow to predict exhaustively stresses in seismically excited structures. In the paper, a convex model is established to treat uncertainty associated with the details of the excitation. In order to set bounds on the response parameters of a SDOF system, assuming that only rough information is available for expected earthquakes at a given site. In particular, we assume that the maximum expected energy of the acclerogram, and the maximum distance of its power spectrum from the target spectrum, typical for the <b>site</b> <b>under</b> <b>construction,</b> are specified...|$|E

As with most aspects of e-commerce, very {{little is known about}} the sources or drivers of successful ebrands. Why are some e-brands better than other e-brands? At the same time, e-brands are a particularly useful way of studying corporate brands because the 2 ̆ 7 entire 2 ̆ 7 corporation appears on a screen in front of you. Not only is the entire organization encapsulated on a single screen, the reputation of that corporation is very sensitive to the way the company is portrayed. A message of 2 ̆ 7 <b>site</b> <b>under</b> <b>construction</b> 2 ̆ 7 quickly damages corporate reputation. The paper develops a framework based on statistical structural modeling of a convenience sample of CD users. The focus of the model is the brand attitude of the user towards the e-retailer. Critical drivers of corporate brand attitude are highlighted and shown to be e-interactivity and e-trust. It is suggested that companies striving to build corporate reputations on business to consumer Web relationships need to place priority on developing capabilities that enhance e-interactivity and etrust...|$|E

50|$|Shortly after Fulgencio Batista {{had control}} of the Cuban {{government}} and became dictator, revolutionaries started to emerge to challenge Batista. However, it wasn't until December 2, 1956, when Fidel Castro landed on Cuba aboard the Granma that the resistance blossomed into an armed revolt. The Soviet Union supported and praised Castro and his resistance. On January 1, 1959, the Cuban government fell, propelling Castro into power, and was recognized by the Soviet government on January 10. When the United States began boycotting Cuban sugar, the Soviet Union began purchasing large quantities to support the Cuban economy in return for fuel and eventually placing nuclear ballistic missiles on Cuban soil. These missiles {{would be capable of}} reaching the United States very quickly. On October 14, 1962, an American spy plane discovered these nuclear missile <b>sites</b> <b>under</b> <b>construction</b> in Cuba.|$|R
