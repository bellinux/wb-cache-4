25|$|<b>Structural</b> <b>walls</b> were lowered {{dramatically}} {{during the}} war, especially informal policies against hiring women, minorities, and workers over 45 or under 18. (See FEPC) Strikes (except in coal mining) were sharply reduced as unions pushed their members to work harder. Tens {{of thousands of}} new factories and shipyards were built, with new bus services and nursery care for children making them more accessible. Wages soared for workers, making it quite expensive to sit at home. Employers retooled so that unskilled new workers could handle jobs that previously required skills that were now in short supply. The combination of all these factors drove unemployment below 2% in 1943.|$|E
40|$|A {{combined}} structural reinforcing element {{and heat}} transfer member is disclosed for placement between a <b>structural</b> <b>wall</b> and an outer insulation blanket.

50|$|A masonry veneer wall {{consists}} of masonry units, usually clay-based bricks, installed {{on one or}} {{both sides of a}} structurally independent wall usually constructed of wood or masonry. In this context the brick masonry is primarily decorative, not structural. The brick veneer is generally connected to the <b>structural</b> <b>wall</b> by brick ties (metal strips that are attached to the <b>structural</b> <b>wall,</b> as well as the mortar joints of the brick veneer). There is typically an air gap between the brick veneer and the <b>structural</b> <b>wall.</b> As clay-based brick is usually not completely waterproof, the <b>structural</b> <b>wall</b> will often have a water-resistant surface (usually tar paper) and weep holes can be left {{at the base of the}} brick veneer to drain moisture that accumulates inside the air gap. Concrete blocks, real and cultured stones, and veneer adobe are sometimes used in a very similar veneer fashion.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{the recent}} years there are vital {{changes in the}} {{construction}} process. In old days building are constructed with Concept of load bearing and then RCC frame construction invented. Now RC <b>Structural</b> <b>wall</b> construction in metropolitan cities is widely used. The latest technique is invented for the modern construction is called as Aluform technique or Mivan technique. In this technique whole building is design with RC <b>structural</b> <b>wall</b> i. e. shear wall. It is specially design to allow rapid construction on all types of architecture layout. This research work having scope of analysis and design of G+ 15 storey building with RC <b>Structural</b> <b>wall</b> and its advantages as a structural point of view. For this thesis design software ETABS is used for design and analysis. Analysis is carried out considering the various seismic and wind load condition for both system of framing.

From analysis result new structural parameter is represented which having the best performance in the worst loading. For validation of work we will go for part manual calculation to check correctness of analysis. Then design for the both system is carried out. For both the system design comparison is done on the basis of % steel and concrete quantity with cost consideration too. Concluding remark will be given with respective high structura...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{safety and}} environmental issues of Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) : inventories, effluents, maintenance, accident safety, waste management, and recycling. The fusion confinement approach among inertial and magnetic options affects how the fusion reaction is maintained and which materials surround the reaction chamber. The target fill technology has {{a major impact on}} the target factory tritium inventory. IFE fusion reaction chambers usually employ some means to protect the first <b>structural</b> <b>wall</b> from fusion pulses. This protective fluid or granular bed also moderates and absorbs most neutrons before they reach the first <b>structural</b> <b>wall.</b> Although the protective fluid activates, most candidate fluids have low activation hazard. Hands-on maintenance seems practical for the driver, target factory, and secondary coolant systems; remote maintenance is likely required for the reaction chamber, primary coolant, and vacuum exhaust cleanup systems. The driver and fuel target facility are well separated from the main reaction chamber...|$|R
50|$|The $20 million seismic {{retrofit}} {{began in}} May 1998. The {{cost of the}} retrofit was considerably increased by the requirement to preserve the historical look of the bridge. Prime contractor Vahani Construction of San Francisco was assisted by Faye Bernstein & Associates and Waldron Engineering. To reinforce the abutments supporting the bridge deck at either end, engineers {{put in place a}} floating slab, continuous with the deck, keyed into a massive pile cap with six 72-inch (1,800 mm) diameter cast-in-drilled-hole (CIDH) piles behind each abutment. To support the towers, engineers designed a full height <b>structural</b> <b>wall</b> that was integrated within each of the two existing towers. During the retrofit, they removed the top portion of the towers, including the roadway, and replaced them with a prestressed diaphragm that anchors the full height of the vertical tower. The diaphragm simultaneously distributes the vertical prestressing forces uniformly to the new concrete <b>structural</b> <b>wall</b> and the existing tower's concrete.|$|R

40|$|Capsule Common {{blackbirds}} select different materials, {{with varying}} biomechanical properties, to construct {{different parts of}} their nest. Aims This study tested the hypothesis that outer components of a nest have a more structural role and so are stronger than materials used to line the cup. Methods Blackbird nests were measured prior to being dismantled to isolate structural components which were tested for mechanical strength and rigidity. Results Outer nest wall materials were significantly thicker, stronger and more rigid than materials in the inner <b>structural</b> <b>wall</b> or the cup lining. In the vertical plane materials used in the <b>structural</b> <b>wall</b> did not differ. By contrast, lining materials {{from the bottom of}} the nest cup were significantly thicker, stronger and more rigid than materials from the top of the cup. Conclusion Blackbirds use different materials in nest construction roles suited to their properties and so may be able to recognise the structural properties of these materials. Materials on the outside of the nest may have a key structural role during construction...|$|R
