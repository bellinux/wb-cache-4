5|$|All {{three of}} the Radetzky-class battleships were {{commissioned}} {{only a few years}} prior the beginning of World War I. Prior to the war, all three battleships were assigned to the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, along with the Tegetthoff-class battleships in the 1st Division.

40|$|In recent years, strong {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} over the increasing numbers of disorderly protests and aggressive activism at <b>sea.</b> Maritime <b>protests</b> raise difficult – and understudied – legal questions concerning the boundaries between the legitimate application of rights {{of freedom of speech}} and assembly on the one hand, and the need to ensure safety of navigation on the other. This article examines the legal arguments in favour of maritime protest as well as national responses to it, in the context of two Polar case studies. Firstly, this article appraises the confrontational activism of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in its anti-whaling campaign in Antarctica, and the problematic application of anti-piracy legislation to more aggressive campaign groups. Secondly, this article examines the position in relation to oil platforms, as exemplified by the Prirazlomnaya dispute in the Arctic, as well as controversial developments in Antarctic jurisdictions.

50|$|<b>Sea</b> Shepherd <b>protested</b> a Canadian seal hunt in the Gulf of St. Lawrence off {{the north}} coast of Nova Scotia in March 1983. The arrival of the group led to a one-day {{suspension}} of the hunt. On March 25, the Sea Shepherd II was ordered back by Canadian authorities after the vessel came within one half-mile of seal hunters. Watson promised to scuttle the ship if they attempted to board it. While in St. John's, Newfoundland, they blockaded a dozen sealing ships in harbor, threatening to ram any ship that left. The Sea Shepherd II was fortified with barbed wire and a water cannon. Sea Shepherd began to harass sealers by chasing half a dozen sealing ships out of the area. On March 27, the vessel was stuck in ice and Watson and three others walked across the ice to Chéticamp where they were later arrested for viewing the seal hunt without a permit. 15 officers boarded the ship from a Canadian Coast Guard vessel {{with the use of}} tear gas and smoke bombs. The crew was arrested without any resistance or injuries. They were charged with conspiracy to commit mischief and conspiracy to commit extortion. Watson was bailed out by actor Mike Farrell and was acquitted upon appeal of the charges. The campaign saved the lives of 76,000 seals.|$|R
2500|$|In his 2002 book Die Wehrmacht, the German {{historian}} Wolfram Wette {{wrote that}} claims made by Raeder and other admirals that the Kriegsmarine {{had nothing to}} do with the Holocaust was false, and several Kriegsmarine units had massacred Jews during the war. Wette stated that the Kriegsmarine had been just as much a part of the genocidal machinery of the National Socialist state as the SS and the Army were. In 1994, the American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that most successful Kriegsmarine operation by far of the entire war was Operation Hannibal, and that: [...] "In these tasks, the remnant German Navy was surprisingly successful. Ironically, it proved to be best in those missions which the founders and leaders of the Imperial and Nazi Navy had pushed aside to pursue world-wide ambitions and offensives; those few who once argued for a navy attuned to coastal and defensive needs were proved right after all". The American historian Charles Thomas in his 1990 book The German Navy in the Nazi Era wrote that in October–November 1918 when confronted with a pointless battle in a war that was already lost that was likely to send them all to a watery grave, the sailors of the High Seas Fleet mutinied in order to live. Thomas wrote that the great achievement of Raeder and Dönitz was to avoid a repeat of the High Seas Fleet mutiny, and instead ensured that thousands of Germans time after time willingly went to their deaths at <b>sea</b> without <b>protest</b> for the greater glory of Adolf Hitler and although it was increasingly becoming clear as time went by that the war was lost, making their deaths utterly senseless.|$|R
500|$|A second accusation, and {{one that}} proved even more {{controversial}} {{in the aftermath of}} the engagement, was the claim that Africaines crew abandoned their guns, refused to load them or deliberately fired them into the <b>sea</b> in <b>protest</b> at Corbet's behaviour. Corbet's brutality was well known in the Navy, James describing him as [...] "an excessively severe officer" [...] who had a [...] "career of cruelty". James does not accuse the crew of any deliberate attempt to sabotage their ship in the engagement, instead attributing their poor gunnery to Corbet's own failings as a commander, most significantly his failure to practice gunnery regularly. Other authors were less understanding of the crew of Africaine, Brenton stating that [...] "they cut the breechings of their guns, and put no shot in them after the first or second broadside", while historian Basil Hall baldly stated in 1833 that they [...] "preferred to be mown down by the French broadsides" [...] than fight under Corbet. This last accusation provoked outrage among naval officers, and Captain Jenkin Jones, a former shipmate of Corbet launched a successful lawsuit, forcing Hall to make a retraction. In 1900, William Laird Clowes commented that [...] "There is, unfortunately, much reason to suppose that Captain Corbett's [...] reputation for extreme severity had antagonised his crew, and that the men did not behave as loyally as they should have behaved". He later castigates Brenton for the suggestion that Corbet committed suicide, suggesting that the wound alone was the cause of death. Modern historians have also been scathing of Corbet's behaviour, Robert Gardiner calling him [...] "notoriously brutal," [...] and Richard Woodman describing Tullidge as [...] "an unfortunate victim of Corbet's cruelty, for suspicions lingered that Africaines brutalised crew had failed to do their utmost in support of their hated commander." ...|$|R

Very large sums were collected, also, from others by this tax, and a great fleet was raised. The performances and exploits of the fleet had some influence in quieting the murmurs of the people. The fleet was the greatest which England had ever possessed. One of its exploits was to compel the Dutch to pay a large sum {{for the privilege of}} fishing in the narrow seas about Great Britain. The Dutch had always maintained that these seas were public, and open to all the world; and they had a vast number of fishing boats, called herring-busses, that used to resort to them for the purpose of catching herring, which they made a business of preserving and sending all over the world. The English ships attacked these fleets of herring-busses, and drove them off; and as the Dutch were not strong enough to defend them, they agreed to pay a large sum annually for the right to fish in the <b>seas</b> in question, <b>protesting,</b> however, against it as an extortion, for they maintained that the English had no control over any seas beyond the bays and estuaries of their own shores.|$|R
40|$|From the Introduction]. In {{the middle}} of the 1960 s, European {{integration}} {{was in a state of}} crisis, not least because of governmental - i. e. French - opposition against the proposed expansion of the supranational powers of the Community institutions, which was felt as a threat to national sovereignty. It took two decades to reach - in the framework of the Single European Act (SEA) - a kind of institutional balance between supranational Community competences and procedures on the one hand and formalized intergovernmental guidance of the integration process as a whole on the other. The new dynamic development which the SEA of 1985 gave rise to was, however, soon to make another serious imbalance more acute, this time between the combination of supranational and intergovernmental Community competence on the one hand and demands for more democratic influence and control on the other. This “democratic deficit" imbalance gave rise to broad popular resistance in certain member countries against the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty of 1991, the seemingly logical and important follow-up of the <b>SEA.</b> Now the <b>protest</b> was against what to many people seemed to be a too great increase in the combined strength of governments and supranational Community institutions at the expense of the powers of national parliaments and other democratically elected organs (Williams 1991) ...|$|R
50|$|On 19 October, {{realising}} {{that the}} war was lost, Liu Yung-fu decided to leave for the Chinese mainland. Accompanied by around a hundred officers of the Tainan garrison, he left the city during the night on the pretence of going to inspect the defences of Anping. He then disguised himself as a coolie and boarded the British merchant ship Thales, bound for Amoy, on the morning of 20 October. The Japanese only got wind of Liu’s flight on the following morning, after they marched into Anping and Tainan, and on 21 October the Thales was pursued by the cruiser Yaeyama, halted fifteen miles from Amoy, and boarded by Japanese sailors. The Japanese sailors did not recognise Liu Yung-fu, but announced that they intended to arrest seven supposed Chinese labourers aboard the British vessel who were unable to give a satisfactory account of themselves. Although the Japanese did not know it, one of the seven labourers was Liu Yung-fu. He owed his escape to the intervention of the British captain. Indignant at being boarded on the high <b>seas,</b> the captain <b>protested</b> vigorously at this illegal search, and when the merchant ship reached Amoy all its passengers, including Liu Yung-fu, were allowed to go ashore without further hindrance. Admiral Arichi Shinanojo, the Japanese fleet commander in the invasion of Formosa, was shortly afterwards forced to resign {{as a result of a}} subsequent British complaint to Japan.
