40|$|Clonal {{deletion}} of thymocytes expressing potentially self-reactive T {{cell receptors}} (TCRs) occurs during thymocyte ontogeny. Mice deficient for CD 4 expression provide a unique model system {{to study the}} contribution of the CD 4 molecule in negative selection of T cells reactive against the major histocompatibility complex class II- associated retroviral <b>self-superantigen,</b> Mls- 1 a. In the presence of Mls- 1 a determinants, mature CD 8 + T cells expressing V beta 6, 8. 1, and 9 were deleted in CD 4 -deficient mice, thus demonstrating that TCR affinity for Mls- 1 a is sufficient for deletion and that a signal through CD 4 was not required. However, in instances where the TCR affinity for Mls- 1 a is low, {{as in the case of}} V beta 7 + T cells, CD 4 expression was required for clonal deletion. These results demonstrate that for Mls- 1 a-mediated clonal deletion of T cells, the requirement for the accessory or coreceptor function of CD 4 depends on the affinity of the TCR...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Neonatal thymectomy induces {{autoimmune}} gastritis in BALB/c (minor lymphocyte-stimulating antigen [Mls]- 1 b) mice, whereas DBA/ 2 (Mls- 1 a) mice are resistant. Resistance {{has been}} linked to the Mls- 1 a locus, which encodes a retroviral superantigen, and to superantigen reactive T cells that express V beta 6 + T-cell receptors. V beta 6 + T cells are known to be deleted in mice expressing Mls- 1 a superantigens. METHODS: Neonatal thymectomized BALB/c and Mls- 1 a congenic BALB. D 2. Mls- 1 a mice were analyzed to examine directly the role of Mls- 1 a <b>self-superantigens</b> and V beta 6 + T cells in autoimmune gastritis. RESULTS: Autoimmune gastritis was detected in thymectomized BALB. D 2. Mls- 1 a mice with high incidence. Autoantibodies to the gastric H+,K(+) -adenosine triphosphatase were present independent of the Mls phenotype in sera of gastritic mice. Severe gastritis had already appeared 1 month after thymectomy in BALB. D 2. Mls- 1 a mice. V beta 6 + T cells were deleted in the stomach lymph nodes of 1 -month-old gastritic BALB. D 2. Mls- 1 a mice but could be detected by immunocytochemistry in the stomach lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous Mls- 1 a <b>self-superantigens</b> and Mls- 1 a reactive V beta 6 + T cells are not involved in resistance to autoimmune gastritis in BALB. D 2 mice...|$|R
40|$|How {{constrained}} is T-cell recognition? Is a truncated T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, missing {{half of its}} V beta components (where V indicates variable), still broad {{enough to}} produce an antigen-specific T-cell response to all determinants? These questions can be answered for certain T-cell antigenic determinants whose response in the wild type is limited to specific gene segments. Our results show that mice with such a deletion in their TCR V beta genes (V beta truncated haplotype, Va beta) are unable to respond to two antigen determinants (sperm whale myoglobin 111 - 121 /I-Ed and myelin basic protein 1 - 11 /I-Au) whose response in the wild type is restricted to the missing V beta (V beta 8. 2 {{in the case of}} 111 - 121 /I-Ed and V beta 8. 2 and V beta 13 in the case of 1 - 11 /I-Au) gene segments. Fundamentally, this restriction could have been attributed to another aspect of immunodominance [...] that a favored TCR with high affinity would dominate the response, but in its absence, a hierarchy of T cells with lesser efficiency and expressing alternate TCR V genes could take over. However, from our experiments it has become evident that there is an absolute limit to the flexibility inherent in the TCR repertoire. Since it is clear that mouse populations have many ambient deletion ligands (such as <b>self-superantigens)</b> that can result in the loss of multiple V beta gene segments during normal T-cell development, these deletions can have serious consequences, such as unresponsiveness to the antigen as a whole [...] a hole in the repertoire [...] if a dominant determinant of that antigen normally shows restricted TCR V beta gene usage...|$|R
