2500|$|In June 1989 Suzuki {{introduced}} {{their first}} three-box sedan since the discontinuation of the Fronte 800 in 1969. Sold as the [...] "Cultus Esteem" [...] in Japan, {{it was also}} available with a larger 1.6-liter engine never offered in the hatchbacks. Suzuki facelifted the Cultus in July 1991 for the 1992 model year. The update involved the relocation of the rear license plate to the rear bumper from in between the tail lamps. The gap vacated by the license plate was filled in with either a black plastic panel or translucent red perspex panel integrating with the tail lamps. At the front, Suzuki revised the bumper's airdam, and inside, the interior was substantially re-designed. In the Japanese market, the Cultus Esteem's carburetted 1.6 {{was replaced by a}} <b>single-point</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> 1.5-liter G15A engine with , to fit a lower tax category.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, an attempt {{has been made}} to predict the {{influence}} of split multiple stage <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> on a DI diesel engine performance and emission characteristics. The predictions have been made for both conventional continuous <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> as well as split multiple stage <b>fuel</b> <b>injection.</b> The analysis mainly emphasize on the prediction of SFC and NOx levels in a diesel engine for the above mentioned two <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> modes.

50|$|The {{first model}} (VAZ-2121 Niva, or Lada Niva 1600 as known commercially) was in {{production}} until 1993 (existing {{in parallel with}} a new model for another six months) when the new and more powerful (1.7 litre, 80 horsepower) four-cylinder petrol engine was introduced, replacing the previously used (1.6 litre, 75hp) VAZ-2106 engine and making {{the appearance of the}} new model (VAZ-21213/21214 or Lada Niva 1.7/1.7i), as was <b>single-point</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> supplied initially by General Motors. Also, the exterior rear section was redesigned with tailgate extended so it could have a lower opening, due to which it also received new, vertical taillights derived from VAZ-2104, instead of former VAZ-2106 horizontal ones. The interior was almost completely redesigned, it received new steering wheel, firstly from VAZ-2107 and later even newer, instrument panel from VAZ-21099, as well as new dashboard, seats, door panels and other details. Multi-point fuel injection designed by Bosch is used currently since 2004. In some markets a 1.9L Peugeot XUD diesel powered Niva was also sold.|$|E

5000|$|For all body styles, the {{powertrain}} of the Favorit {{used one}} internal combustion petrol engine, , inline-four-cylinder, four-stroke, liquid-cooled, overhead valve, {{which was an}} upgraded version of the [...] engine used in the Škoda 1000MB. This initially produced a rated motive power output of [...] at 5,000 rpm. It originally used either a Pierburg 2E-E Ecotronic single-barrel carburettor, or a Pierburg Ecotronic dual-barrel carburettor. This engine had its combustion chambers redesigned by Ricardo Consulting Engineers in the UK, while German car maker Porsche helped engineer the engine mountings. Throughout its timescale in the Favorit, the engine was progressively upgraded with various iterations of emissions control systems, including {{two different types of}} catalytic converter, and also utilised improved fuelling and engine control by way of Bosch Mono-Motronic <b>single-point</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection.</b> These changes had minor effects on the rated power (50kW) and torque outputs. The engine requires the cam chain changed every 60,000 km, but it can last over 200,000 km (cases of engines working 400,000 km without the change of cam chain are known, although with serious degradation of performance, respectively). The chain is relatively short, but has no tensioner.|$|E
50|$|Five engines were available: two Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engines; the 1,779 cc and 1,962 cc with <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> and two Alfa Romeo V6 engines: 1,996 cc V6 <b>fuel</b> <b>injection,</b> 2,492 cc V6 <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> and 2,393 cc {{turbodiesel}} made by VM Motori.

5000|$|The second {{generation}} LeMans launched in 1994, {{available as a}} three- and five-door hatchback and four-door sedan with a 1.5-litre eight-valve or a 1.5-litre 16-valve engine. These new models were still based on the Opel Kadett E, underpinned by the [...] "T-car" [...] platform. There were various trim levels available; in the United Kingdom, where the car sold as the Daewoo Nexia, these were GLi (8-valve) and GLXi (16-valve) for the general public, with a [...] "base" [...] model available for large contracts. Unlike the Kadett, {{there was never a}} station wagon version available. Some European markets got the [...] "Lifestyle" [...] trim level; Spain and Portugal badged their GLi/GLXi equivalents [...] "Chess"; the Benelux countries kept the GLi/GLXi trim levels and some markets added ETi and STi specifications. The GLi has an average performance with a 0-100 km/h time of 12.5 seconds and [...] at 5,400 rpm. There was also a version with <b>single-point</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> and [...] for lower-spec versions. The more luxurious GLXi received a sixteen-valve engine which upped the power to [...] at an unusually low 4,800 rpm, and the 0-100 km/h time was reduced to 12.2 seconds.|$|E

40|$|Diesel {{engines are}} used mainly in heavy duty {{machines}} and vehicles. Diesel engines have many advantages {{such as high}} fuel efficiency, reliability and durability. The performance of diesel engines depends on many parameters. One of the important parameters which influence the performance of diesel engines is <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> pressure. <b>Fuel</b> <b>injection</b> pressure plays {{an important aspect of}} power performance of the engine to obtain combustion treatment. The objective of this project is to study the effects of <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> pressure on the performance for diesel engine. Mathematical formulation for <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> system developed to obtain the result to analyse the performance of diesel engine based on <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> pressure.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> ratio on the {{combustion}} and emission characteristics of stratified lean mixture combustion was investigated for a spray-guided liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) direct injection engine. Inter-injection spark-ignition combustion—a specially designed combustion strategy for LPG fuel derived from a two-staged injection—was employed to maximize the improvement in thermal efficiency when combustion stability is secured. When changing the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> ratio, the optimum spark advance and <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> timings were experimentally determined to maximize the thermal efficiency based on sweeping timings. The optimum <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> ratio with the highest thermal efficiency (42. 76 %) and stable operation was 60 %/ 40 %, with the optimization of the spark advance and <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> timing, because of the locally rich mixture region in the recirculation zone. NOx emissions were at their highest level with a <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> ratio of 60 %/ 40 % {{because of the high}} combustion temperature, and the levels of total hydrocarbon and CO emissions with 50 %/ 50 % and 60 %/ 40 % <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> ratios were similar, whereas emissions at 70 %/ 30 % were significantly higher because of fuel wetting and the formation of over-lean mixture...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of lean burn in a spark-ignition (SI) engine with optimized <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> was experimentally investigated and numerically simulated. The experiments {{were carried out}} on a production SI engine which has a port <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> (PFI) system. The previous port electronic <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> system was modified and the technique of double-pulse <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> (DFI) was employed. By regulating injection timings and proportions of DFI, the air-fuel mixture stratification was significantly improved and the expected lean burn was implemented. The experimental {{results showed that the}} reduction of fuel consumption with DFI could be above 10 per cent over quite a wide load range, compared to single <b>fuel</b> <b>injection.</b> With optimized <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> timings and double-pulse proportions, the ideal engine performance and emissions can be achieved with a two to three times higher air-fuel ratio (AFR) than single <b>fuel</b> <b>injection.</b> With numerical simulation, the effects of mixture stratification formed by different <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> amounts and timings were analysed using a phenomenological model. The mixture in the cylinder was divided into different regions that distribute spherically around the spark plug and consist of a central region of stoichiometric air-fuel mixture and a gradually leaner outside region. Simulation results demonstrated that the improvements in fuel economy and emissions with DFI were mainly attributed to increased stratification zones and a reduced AFR gradient in the stratification zones...|$|R
40|$|The inner {{diameter}} of {{high pressure fuel}} pipe has {{a significant effect on}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> process and the performance of a diesel engine. The spray impact force of each nozzle hole of a conventional injection system of pump-line-nozzle for diesel engine (based on the spray momentum flux) and the injection pressure (on a <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> pump test rig) were measured. With varying <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> quantities and pump speed, the effects of the {{inner diameter}} of the high pressure fuel pipe on <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> process and the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> characteristics of each nozzle hole were analyzed. It was noted from experimental results that the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> pressure changes with variations in the inner diameter of the high pressure fuel pipe and also the injection duration gradually increases with increase in the inner diameter. At low injection pump speed, even with the same geometric fuel deliver rate, the injection duration also increases gradually. Due to throttling effect and reduction in <b>injection</b> pressure, the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> quantities of the injection nozzle were relatively minimal when the inner diameters of the high pressure fuel pipe were respectively small and large. The optimum injection pipe inner diameter for the right quantity for <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> falls between the two cases (between small and large). In addition, the injection rate of each nozzle hole increases with the decrease in angle between the needle axis and each of the nozzle hole axis. The <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> quantity of each nozzle hole increases while their relative difference decreases with increasing pump speed...|$|R
