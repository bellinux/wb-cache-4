25|$|The {{growth of}} the cotton, {{turpentine}} and lumber industries {{in the area of}} Singletary Lake State Park eventually was greater than what the soil could support. The fertility of the farmland was depleted and most of the <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> had been clear cut from Bladen County. The land could no longer support the demands of the people living on the land. Farmers were no longer able to produce sustainable crops and many were forced to leave their farms.|$|E
25|$|In the Colonial era {{the energy}} {{policy of the}} United States was for free use of <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> for heating and industry. In the 19th century, new {{emphasis}} was placed on access to coal and its use for transport, heating and industry. Whales were rendered into lamp oil. Later, coal gas was fractionated for use as lighting and town gas. Natural gas was first used in America for lighting in 1816., it has grown in importance for use in homes, industry, and power plants, but natural gas production reached its U.S. peak in 1973, and the price has risen significantly since then.|$|E
25|$|Naturalist and painter John James Audubon {{visited the}} Lehigh Gorge in 1829 and spent {{over a month}} {{painting}} the birds of the area. At this time the gorge was largely untouched by human hands, but Audubon could see {{that this was not}} to last. The demand for lumber was intense during the mid-to-late 19th century and the forests of much of Pennsylvania were stripped bare. Lehigh Gorge was no exception, its old-growth forests of white pine and hemlock were harvested and sent down the Lehigh River. The wood was used for lumber and the bark was used in tanneries to make leather. The second largest tannery in the United States was along the Lehigh River at the small town of Lehigh Tannery. By 1875 most of the saleable timber had been clear-cut,with many acres of dried treetops and other wooden debris left on the ground. That same year a spark from a passing coal-fired steam locomotive ignited a massive forest fire that burned the debris, the remaining <b>standing</b> <b>timber,</b> the sawmills, and their lumber stockpiles. This forest fire brought {{about the end of the}} lumber era in the Lehigh Gorge.|$|E

50|$|Aside {{from modern}} replicas, several other archaeological sites have had Stonehenge's name {{partially}} or fully incorporated {{into their own}} names. America's Stonehenge is an unusual and controversial site in New Hampshire. A henge near Stonehenge containing concentric rings of postholes for <b>standing</b> <b>timbers,</b> discovered in 1922, was named Woodhenge by its excavators because of similarities with Stonehenge. The name Woodhenge is also used for the American site of Cahokia. The timber Seahenge in Norfolk was named as such by journalists writing about its discovery in 1998.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} of some early Neolithic activity at the site, most of the structures seem to have been built in the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age. At some point c. 2600 BC, a large timber circle was constructed. It is now known as the Southern Circle. The circle was oriented southeast towards the sunrise on the midwinter solstice and consisted of four large concentric circles of postholes, which would have held extremely large <b>standing</b> <b>timbers.</b> A paved avenue was also constructed on a slightly different alignment - towards the sunset on the summer solstice - that led to the River Avon. This feature is similar to the Stonehenge Avenue. A large timber post lay on this orientation, about as far away from the circle as the Heelstone is from Stonehenge.|$|R
25|$|Extensive logging of redwoods {{began in}} the early nineteenth century. The trees were felled by ax and saw onto beds of tree limbs and shrubs to cushion their fall. Stripped of their bark, the logs were transported to mills or {{waterways}} by oxen or horse. Loggers then burned the accumulated tree limbs, shrubs, and bark. The repeated fires favored secondary forests of primarily redwoods as redwood seedlings sprout readily in burned areas. The introduction of steam engines allowed logs to be dragged through long skid trails to nearby railroads, furthering the reach of loggers beyond the land nearby rivers previously used to transport trees. This method of harvesting, however, disturbed large amounts of soil, producing secondary-growth forests of species other than redwood such as Douglas-fir, grand fir, and western hemlock. After World War II, trucks and tractors gradually replaced steam engines, giving rise to two harvesting approaches: clearcutting and selection harvesting. Clearcutting involved felling all the trees in a particular area and was encouraged by tax law which exempted all <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> from taxation if 70% of trees in the area were harvested. Selection logging, by contrast, called for the removal 25% to 50% of mature trees in the hopes that the remaining trees would allow for future growth and reseeding. This method, however, encouraged growth of other tree species, converting redwood forests into mixed forests of redwood, grand fir, Sitka spruce, and western hemlock. Moreover, the trees left standing were often felled by windthrow; that is, they were often blown over by the wind.|$|E
2500|$|Farms {{were for}} sale with from ten to fifty acres cleared, {{possessing}} log houses, peach and sometimes apple orchards, inclosed in fences, and having plenty of <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> for fuel.

[...] 47 cwt of bell metal was {{recovered}} {{which suggests that the}} tenor was 13 or 14 cwt. The metal was used to cast three new bells, by William Eldridge of Chertsey in 1672, with a further saints bell cast that year by Hodson. In the absence of a tower, the tenor and saints bell were hung in a free <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> structure, whilst the others remained unhung.|$|E

50|$|Evidence of {{the second}} phase is no longer visible. The number of postholes dating to the early 3rd {{millennium}} BC suggest {{that some form of}} timber structure was built within the enclosure during this period. Further <b>standing</b> <b>timbers</b> were placed at the northeast entrance, and a parallel alignment of posts ran inwards from the southern entrance. The postholes are smaller than the Aubrey Holes, being only around 0.4 m in diameter, and are much less regularly spaced. The bank was purposely reduced in height and the ditch continued to silt up. At least twenty-five of the Aubrey Holes are known to have contained later, intrusive, cremation burials dating to the two centuries after the monument's inception. It seems that whatever the holes' initial function, it changed to become a funerary one during Phase 2. Thirty further cremations were placed in the enclosure's ditch and at other points within the monument, mostly in the eastern half. Stonehenge is therefore interpreted as functioning as an enclosed cremation cemetery at this time, the earliest known cremation cemetery in the British Isles. Fragments of unburnt human bone have also been found in the ditch-fill. Dating evidence is provided by the late Neolithic grooved ware pottery that has been found in connection with the features from this phase.|$|R
2500|$|AuCoin {{had a hand}} in {{the rescue}} of Northwest lumber and plywood mills during the {{recession}} of the early 1980s. The mills faced financial ruin when federal timber sales contracts they had purchased at a face value of {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} were rendered worthless by the collapse of the lumber and plywood markets. Along with Senators Hatfield and Howard Metzenbaum, AuCoin helped write [...] the Federal Timber Contract Payment Modification Act of 1984. After requiring timber companies to pay a penalty to the U.S. Treasury, the bill released the firms from their contracts and allowed them to return approximately 9.5 billion board feet of <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> to the government, much of it commercially pre-thinned.|$|E

2500|$|After the storm, Governor Carroll Campbell {{said that}} the storm {{destroyed}} enough timber in South Carolina to [...] "frame a home for every family {{in the state of}} West Virginia". An immense salvage effort was undertaken to harvest downed pine trees for pulpwood before they deteriorated {{to the point where they}} could not be used. Still <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> that appeared usable for lumber and plywood frequently had annular separations of the rings that made them dangerous to saw and nearly impossible to cut into plies, so they were also downgraded into pulpwood, leading to such a drop in pulpwood prices that eventually much of the salvage effort ceased. In South Carolina, which bore the brunt of the storm, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was slow in responding. United States Senator from South Carolina Fritz Hollings referred to the agency as [...] "a bunch of bureaucratic jackasses" [...] during a speech on the floor of the United States Senate. An investigation was launched, which led to some reforms in FEMA procedures that helped the agency do a somewhat better job during Hurricane Andrew, the next catastrophic hurricane to strike the United States. However, FEMA was criticized severely in 2005 for its similarly insufficient response to Hurricane Katrina.|$|E

50|$|The first {{monument}} {{consisted of}} a circular bank and ditch enclosure made of Late Cretaceous (Santonian Age) Seaford Chalk, measuring about 110 m in diameter, with a large entrance to the north east and a smaller one to the south. It stood in open grassland on a slightly sloping spot. The builders placed the bones of deer and oxen {{in the bottom of}} the ditch, as well as some worked flint tools. The bones were considerably older than the antler picks used to dig the ditch, and the people who buried them had looked after them for some time prior to burial. The ditch was continuous but had been dug in sections, like the ditches of the earlier causewayed enclosures in the area. The chalk dug from the ditch was piled up to form the bank. This first stage is dated to around 3100 BC, after which the ditch began to silt up naturally. Within the outer edge of the enclosed area is a circle of 56 pits, each about a metre (1 m) in diameter, known as the Aubrey holes after John Aubrey, the seventeenth-century antiquarian who was thought to have first identified them. The pits may have contained <b>standing</b> <b>timbers</b> creating a timber circle, although there is no excavated evidence of them. A recent excavation has suggested that the Aubrey Holes may have originally been used to erect a bluestone circle. If this were the case, it would advance the earliest known stone structure at the monument by some 500 years. A small outer bank beyond the ditch could also date to this period.|$|R
