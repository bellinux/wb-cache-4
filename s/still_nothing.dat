500|$|Clarissa Dickson Wright, in her A History of English Food, calls Acton [...] "the best cookery {{writer of}} the period", noting that she paid [...] "considerable attention" [...] to curry in the book. Dickson Wright {{comments}} that Acton knew about [...] "her countrymen"'s {{lack of understanding of}} curry and [...] "lamented 'the great superiority of the oriental curries over those generally prepared in England'". She further notes that Acton suggested practical improvements, such as grating coconut into the gravy, and using tamarind, acid apples and cucumber to simulate the [...] "piquancy you get with bitter gourds, mango, and so on", which she comments was certainly better than lazily adding lemon juice, but <b>still</b> <b>nothing</b> like [...] "anything prepared by my grandmother's Indian cook." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Mark Snow gave [...] "The Rings of Akhaten" [...] {{a rating}} of 7.2 out of 10. He wrote that Akhaten [...] "felt like a fully formed world" [...] but criticised the {{resolution}} and the Mummy's appearance. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode {{three and a half}} out of five stars and called it [...] "a mixed bag ... but still with enough elements of uniqueness to demonstrate, almost 50 years on, just why there is <b>still</b> <b>nothing</b> like Doctor Who on television". He wrote that the religion and singing was well-realised, but felt the [...] "mind parasite" [...] was too similar to the Great Intelligence which was featured the previous week, and also thought the many aliens [...] "gave more than a hint of trying too hard and did not get things off to the best of starts". Digital Spy reviewer Morgan Jeffery praised Clara and the monsters, but felt that after a good build-up the episode fell apart at its climax, which he felt was [...] "far too fantastical".|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Ruffalo said he {{believed}} the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, [...] "I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did The Avengers it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's <b>still</b> <b>nothing</b> definitive, not even a skeletal version {{of what it would}} be." [...] In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in Phase Two of the MCU, by saying, [...] "After the first Avengers, Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in [...] So it was really about, frankly, saving somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between Avengers movies is the next Avengers movie, so [...] could continue to play with that in [...] Where we go after that, we'll see." [...] In October 2014, again on a solo film, Feige said [...] "we'll see. We'd love to do it, we'd love to find the place to put it, but right now, Hulk will be appearing, with his friends, in their [...] films." ...|$|E

2500|$|The major {{disagreement}} between both sides at the Bucharest conference was {{the status of}} Artsakh. Azerbaijan's preferred solution would be to give Artsakh the [...] "highest status of autonomy adopted in the world." [...] Armenia, on the other hand, endorsed a popular vote by the inhabitants of Artsakh to decide their future, a position that was also taken by the international mediators. On 27 June, the Armenian foreign minister said both parties agreed to allow the residents of Artsakh to vote regarding the future status of the region. The Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially refuted that statement. According to Azeri opposition leader Isa Gambar, however, Azerbaijan did indeed agree to the referendum. <b>Still,</b> <b>nothing</b> official has confirmed this yet.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2009, Carter said {{he could}} not [...] "ensure" [...] another movie would be made, but thought the {{international}} box office for the 2008 film made it at least a theoretical possibility. In an interview published in August 2012, Spotnitz said he was talking up the idea of an X-Files movie every chance he got, but that there was <b>still</b> <b>nothing</b> happening on that front, and that time was running very short for a third movie concluding the original X-Files franchise to be made at all. [...] He blamed the poor performance of the 2008 film on {{the fact that it was}} not about aliens. Speaking at San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2013, Carter, when asked about a third film, was extremely non-committal, indicating there was still no forward movement, and saying, [...] "We can get to it later." [...] On August 2013, Carter said, in an interview with Empire, that [...] "It's really up to 20th Century Fox, whether they have the will to do it. I think all of us are interested in putting the band back together", adding that a third installment would be a return to the mythology and that the colonisation date of the television series would not be ignored.|$|E

5000|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety stated, [...] "The {{whole picture}} may be hokey, {{but the first}} part is agreeably so, the second part not. At the very least, one comes away with a new {{appreciation}} {{of the difficulty of}} inner-office romance at the CIA." [...] Mike Clark of USA Today gave a mixed review to the film, stating, [...] "Nothing is ever what it seems, but <b>still,</b> <b>nothing's</b> very compelling in The Recruit, a less-than-middling melodrama whose subject matter and talent never click as much as its credits portend." ...|$|R

60|$|Mitchell tottered. He grasped my arm for support. Everything {{was very}} <b>still.</b> <b>Nothing</b> broke the stillness but the humming of the bees, {{the murmur of}} the distant wavelets, {{and the sound of}} Mitchell's caddie going on with his apple.|$|E

6000|$|He laughed, {{and then}} they both laughed {{together}} consciously; and <b>still</b> <b>nothing</b> or everything had been said.
