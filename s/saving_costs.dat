After attempts at simplifying the products {{as a means of}} <b>saving</b> <b>costs,</b> the famous Binns Road factory in Liverpool finally closed its doors in November 1979. By comparison, Corgi Toys managed to struggle on until 1983. Matchbox was taken over by Universal International of Hong Kong in 1982 (McGimpsey & Orr 1989, p.28). Thus ended the era when UK-made die-cast toy models were dominant.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis project identifies current sources of <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> and <b>cost</b> avoidance generated through Army foreign military sales (FMS). Using a comparative high-low case-study approach, a high-demand volume case and a low-demand volume case were selected in major weapons categories. The cases were analyzed on an internal basis to determine <b>cost</b> <b>savings,</b> <b>cost</b> avoidance, and public value. Once the cases were analyzed and compared against each other, advantages or trends in <b>cost</b> <b>savings,</b> <b>cost</b> avoidance, and public value became apparent. Upon completion of our analysis, we determined that <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> were usually gained from reduced system unit costs due to higher economic order quantities, reduced overhead costs per unit, and reduced unit costs resulting from manufacturing learning curves. Additional costs were avoided by reducing gaps in production lines. Furthermore, we {{determined that the}} Army’s FMS strategy needs improvement {{in order to take}} full advantage of these sources of <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> and <b>cost</b> avoidance.

Objective: To describe the characteristics of the interventions and to determine pharmacist’s interventions led to change in <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> and <b>cost</b> avoidance in intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: A Prospective, standard care-controlled study design was used to compare <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> and <b>cost</b> avoidance of patients receiving care from patient care team (including a clinical pharmacist) versus standard care (no pharmacist on team). All patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit 1 and 2 during the same period were included in the study. The outcome measures were overall drug cost and length of ICU stay. Interventions made by the pharmacist in the study group were documented. The analyses of acceptance and <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> and/or <b>cost</b> avoidance were also performed. Results: A total of 65 patients were admitted to either ICU 1 or 2 during the 5 week- study period. The pharmacist participated in patient care and made total of 127 interventions for the ICU- 1 team. Ninety-eight percent of the interventions were accepted and implemented by physicians. The difference of overall drug cost per patient between two groups was 182. 01 USD (1, 076. 37 USD in study group and 1, 258. 38 USD in control group, p= 0. 138). The average length of ICU stay for the intervention group and the control group was not significantly different (7. 16 days vs. 6. 18 days, p= 0. 995). The 125 accepted interventions were evaluated for <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> and <b>cost</b> avoidance. Pharmacist’s interventions yielded a total of 1, 971. 43 USD from drug <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> and 294. 62 USD from adverse drug event cost avoidance. The net cost saved and avoided from pharmacist interventions was 2, 266. 05 USD. Interventions involving antibiotic use accounted for the largest economic impact (1, 958. 61 USD).
