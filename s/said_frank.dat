5|$|In a new {{affidavit}} (his second affidavit {{and third}} statement), Conley admitted he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank. He {{said he had}} met Frank on the street on Saturday, and was told to follow him to the factory. Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by two women who were visiting Frank in his office. He <b>said</b> <b>Frank</b> dictated the murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, then told {{him to leave the}} factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.|$|E
500|$|On May 29, Conley {{was interviewed}} for four hours. His new {{affidavit}} said that Frank told him, [...] "he {{had picked up}} a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something." [...] Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two {{had returned to the}} office. He <b>said</b> <b>Frank</b> gave him $200, but took it back, saying, [...] "Let me have that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens." [...] Conley's affidavit concluded, [...] "The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help me out and I decided to tell the whole truth about this matter." [...] At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He <b>said</b> <b>Frank</b> decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.|$|E
500|$|Filming wrapped after 100 days on April 20, 1985, and {{the film}} was delayed from May to August. But after a highly {{positive}} test screening ("I'd never seen a preview like that," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Frank</b> Marshall, [...] "the audience {{went up to the}} ceiling"), Sheinberg chose to move the release date to July 3. To make sure the film met this new date, two editors, Arthur Schmidt and Harry Keramidas, were assigned to the picture, while many sound editors worked 24-hour shifts on the film. Eight minutes were cut, including Marty watching his mom cheat during an exam, George getting stuck in a telephone booth before rescuing Lorraine, as well as much of Marty pretending to be Darth Vader. Zemeckis almost cut out the [...] "Johnny B. Goode" [...] sequence as he felt it did not advance the story, but the preview audience loved it, so it was kept. Industrial Light & Magic created the film's 32 effects shots, which did not satisfy Zemeckis and Gale until a week before the film's completion date. The compositing involved for the film's time travel sequences, {{as well as for the}} lightning effects in the climactic clock tower scene, was handled by animation supervisor Wes Takahashi, who would also work on the subsequent two Back to the Future films with the rest of the ILM crew.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{would be}} well, sir, I think," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Franks,</b> [...] "to make John Potter {{overseer}} {{in place of}} Williamson; he is a better and steadier man. If you have no objection--" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "No one in {{this country}} {{probably}} was more surprised than I when {{weapons of mass destruction}} were not used against our troops as they moved toward Baghdad," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Franks</b> on December 2, 2005.|$|R
500|$|... 343 {{started with}} a staff of roughly a dozen people, but grew to nearly 200 through {{development}}. Halo 4s development team included former employees of more than 25 triple-A studios. Prospective employees could not be told {{they were going to be}} working on Halo 4. [...] "We had people who we hired who hated Halo because of 'X,'" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Frank</b> O'Connor, 343 Industries' franchise development director. [...] "But what that really meant was, 'I feel like this game could be awesome because of 'Y input' that I'm going to bring into it. I want to prove it, and I'm passionate about proving it.' So we ended up with a bunch of people who were genuinely passionate about the product. That is a huge advantage, and that helped in hiring and forming our team." [...] This rapid hiring and growth occurred during development of the game, creating issues; because the team was committed to a delivery date, Halo 4 executive producer Kiki Wolfkill said that the team was forced to make [...] "necessary mistakes", with production difficulties and a team inexperienced with working together contributing to development difficulties. Nine months before shipping, the developers restructured the game's production pipeline and gave individual teams more control due to bottlenecks in development. [...] With so many developers from different backgrounds, forging a common goal and company culture was different. Creative director Josh Holmes recalled that an [...] "epiphany moment" [...] that proved the team was headed in the right direction was early in development, when the team completed a section of the game that was [...] "very traditional [...] ". Despite positive feedback from testers, 343 Industries discarded the prototype as too traditional, but felt that it showed the team could work together.|$|E

2500|$|Fulco was {{a former}} member of the {{influential}} Louisiana Democratic State Central Committee. [...] "He had been in politics nearly all his life. He did it to help people.

5000|$|In 1989, Franks {{released}} Golden River Fiddlin to the Folk and Bluegrass markets.

[...] "Playing the Sands was the pinnacle of an entertainer's career. Only the best musicians were in Morelli's orchestra. Partly, that's what makes it such a historically significant era in this town. This performance will be {{a celebration of the}} birth of that kind of entertainment and the history of Las Vegas." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It--what? Let me hear! I'm very stupid, you know!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Frank,</b> in a {{voice of}} exulting comprehension, belying his alleged stupidity.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can always}} remember," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Frank's</b> wife, [...] "when our Harold was bad, he did nothink but see an angel at th' back o' th' lookin'-glass. 'Look, mother,' 'e said, 'at that angel!' 'Theer isn't no angel, my duck,' I said, but he wouldn't have it. I took th' lookin'-glass off'n th' dressin'-table, {{but it made}} no difference.
