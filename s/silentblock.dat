40|$|The article {{presents}} a still {{important aspect of}} the construction and operation of the vehicle. The most loaded part of the suspension of a vehicle has been discussed, for example, rubber-metal bushing (<b>silentblock).</b> This component directly affects the safety and comfort of drive. It also presents the main varieties of construction and signs of usage of those elements. It has comprised of properties of the rubber and polyurethane bushings. Mechanical calculation of <b>silentblock</b> model has also been presented. 3 D numerical analysis was carried out {{on the basis of the}} model by using two types of rubber bushings with different hardness. The results of simulations carried out in the system MSC. MARC has been shown. On these basis, there were selected and given numerous conclusions for utilitarian character...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the design of the {{technology}} of manufacture of metallic insert that is included to the shock absorbing element of truck axle <b>silentblock.</b> The insert is made of ´U´ profile metallic sheets with bent edges at both ends, thickness 2 mm. What was chosen as the most fitting technology based on manufacturing requirements and production series size of 160 000 units per year is conventional tool bending. The required form of the insert is achieved by two operations: in the first step, both metallic sheet edges are preliminary bent and in the second step the central part is bent to the ´U´ form. The material chosen for the manufacture of the insert is micro-alloyed structural steel S 315 MC the mechanical properties of which match requirements of the finished product. The part will be manufactured on eccentric press LEXN 100 C and its production cost is CZK 4. 60...|$|E
40|$|The bachelor`s thesis, {{which was}} written {{on the grounds of}} the bachelor`s study {{programme}} B 3 S-P Mechanical Engineering, the field B-STG Technology in Engineering, deals with the production of moldings for transport of copy devices abroad. Molding is used for setting of the device in wooden box and it is placed on <b>silentblocks</b> to avoid damage of the copy device. The bachelor`s thesis contains a study of the particular issue, a proposal for the cutting machine and bending machine together with an economic evaluation...|$|R
