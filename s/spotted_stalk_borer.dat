50|$|Chilo partellus, the <b>spotted</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borer,</b> is a moth in {{the family}} Crambidae. It was {{described}} by Swinhoe in 1885. It is found in India, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and on Mayotte.|$|E
50|$|Larvae: Larvae of C. partellus {{resemble}} caterpillars {{and can be}} creamy-white to yellowish-brown in colour. These larvae {{also have}} four purple-brown longitudinal stripes and are usually found with characteristically dark-brown spots along the back, therefore giving off a spotted appearance. When the larvae of the <b>spotted</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> are fully grown, they produce a conspicuous reddish-brown head. It has a plate on the dorsal surface of the thorax which {{is known as a}} prothoracic shield and is reddish-brown to dark-brown and shiny.|$|E
50|$|Since crambids are {{relatively}} common throughout human settlements, the moths tend to affect crops and gardens, whether harmfully, beneficially or harmlessly. Beneficial crambids include the water hyacinth moth (Niphograpta albiguttalis), {{used to control}} its host (Eichhornia crassipes), the water veneer (Acentria ephemerella), a biocontrol agent used against Eurasian watermilfoil), and the bamboo borer (Omphisa fuscidentalis), of which the caterpillars are used for human consumption (see entomophagy). The mint moth (Pyrausta aurata) {{is an example of}} a harmless crambid. Crambid larvae are typically stem borers in plants of the grass family. As this family contains many important crops, some Crambidae species achieve pest status. The European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis is perhaps the best known; introduced to the United States in the early 1900s, it is now widespread in all but the westernmost states. Other pest species include the <b>spotted</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> (Chilo partellus), the Asiatic rice borer (Chilo suppressalis), sod webworms (Crambus spp.), Duponchelia fovealis, the sugarcane borer (Diatraea saccharalis), bean pod borers (Maruca spp.), the rice white stemborer (Scirpophaga innotata), the southwestern corn borer (Diatraea grandiosella), and the grape leaffolder (Desmia maculalis).|$|E

Some <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> already may be in corn because they hatched from eggs that were laid on grass or giant ragweed {{out in the field}} last fall, or they moved directly into border row corn instead of the grass when they hatched.

40|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borer,</b> Chilo sacchariphagus Bojer, {{is a major}} pest of {{sugarcane}} {{in southern}} Asia, the Indian Ocean islands and Mozambique in southern Africa. Since 1999, a biological control programme has been developed on this pest in Reunion Island through a partnership between research and development organisations. Trichogramma chilonis Ishii {{has been shown to}} be the most naturally efficient parasitoid of the borer in Reunion, following a comparison of the bionomics of different strains of T. chilonis, and one strain was selected for mass production and field release testing. In 2002, two distinct sites, Savannah (SAV) and Sainte-Marie (SMA), were chosen for field experiments. At each site, plots were treated with releases of 150 000 T. chilonis per hectare and compared with untreated plots. In both plots, efficacy of these releases was assessed through damage to sugarcane internodes and mass of millable stalks at harvest. In treated plots, the percentage of bored internodes at harvest was 45 % less than the controls at SAV and 36 % at SMA. The mean stalk mass was 14 % higher in treated plots at SAV, and 12 % at SMA, corresponding to increases of 15 and 12 tons of cane per hectare, respectively. These results are presented and improvements in a new trial are suggested...|$|E
40|$|Resistance in {{sugarcane}} [Saccharum spec. (Poaceae) ] to the <b>spotted</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borer,</b> Chilo sacchariphagus (Bojer) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), was {{studied by}} comparing feeding behaviour on resistant cv. R 570 and susceptible cv. R 579. In a field survey, the feeding behaviour of C. sacchariphagus larvae was described {{to identify their}} feeding sites on the plant. In a greenhouse artificial infestation study, we compared the establishment of larvae on potted plants. In laboratory choice and no-choice experiments, we studied the establishment of larvae on plant organs (stalk, sheath, leaf spindle). Study of the feeding behaviour showed that: (1) first to fourth instars are able to feed on stalk, sheath, and leaf spindle, (2) boring into the stalk occurs mostly in the four uppermost internodes, and (3) most young larvae bore through the abaxial surface of leaf sheaths to reach the stalk. In greenhouse experiments, we observed an early two-fold reduction {{of the number of}} larvae on R 570 plants within the first 48 h after infestation. In laboratory experiments, larval antixenosis was demonstrated at the abaxial surface of R 570 leaf sheath, but was observed neither in the leaf spindle nor in the stalk. First, second, and third instars were susceptible to this antixenosis. We hypothesize that the main resistance mechanism in R 570 is an early reduction of larval establishment on plants, due to antixenosis located at the abaxial surface of leaf sheaths.

40|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borer,</b> Chilo sacchariphagus Bojer, {{is a major}} pest of {{sugarcane}} {{in southern}} Asia and on islands in the southwest of the Indian Ocean. In Reunion, Mauritius and Madagascar, the borer has been a serious pest since it was introduced with sugarcane during the 19 th century. The Entomology Laboratory of CIRAD, which has been working for nearly 30 years on insect pests, including stem borers, has focused its research programme on {{the control of the}} <b>spotted</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> since 1994. About 17 species of natural enemies of C. sacchariphagus were introduced into Reunion from various countries in the 1970 s, but only one third of them established themselves and none have successfully controlled populations of the borer. Therefore, the bio-ecology of the borer is being re-examined, from population dynamics in the field to laboratory studies, with biological control of the borer as the main goal. Life tables studies indicate that the borer is more likely to develop large populations in the lowlands of the island, where the temperature exceeds 20 °C nearly all year round (optimum temperature for development of C. sacchariphagus is 26 °C). The population dynamics of the borer were precisely determined, on the two main varieties of sugarcane (R 570 and R 579) grown in Reunion, at two sites on the island representing distinct climatic zones. On a regional scale, the population dynamics of C. sacchariphagus have been studied in relation to damage caused to sugarcane. Such damage is expressed as the number of infested sugarcane internodes in sampled stalks. These factors have been examined in relation to variety, cultural, practices, and climate for four consecutive years at 50 sites distributed over the island. Similarities in infestation level observed between neighbouring sites were frequent, and revealed a regional pattern, probably related to the local climate. Crop loss studies showed that only R 579 was affected in terms of cane yield, expressing a reduction in growth rate, height and diameter of the stalks at harvest. In heavy infestations, yield loss can reach 30 % of the mass of commercial cane, compared with losses in resistant variety R 570. Repeated studies over several crop cycles and field trials also confirmed that the variety R 579 was more susceptible to C. sacchariphagus than the more common variety R 570. The latter is resistant to the borer and various aspects of this resistance (antibiosis, antixenosis, and penetrometry of stalks) have been investigated. Resistance appears to be due, at least in part, to the mechanical characteristics of cane stalks arising from the structure of plant tissues and components of cell walls (tannin, lignin or silicate). This is being studied using artificial diets with sugarcane powder to rear C. sacchariphagus larvae. The impact of predators, predominantly ants of the genus Pheidole, on borer egg masses was quantified: 80 - 90 % of the eggs are eaten by predators. It is believed that the practice of burning the crop, before or after harvesting, has negative effects on natural enemies; moreover borer larvae and pupae, living inside the stalks, are less affected by the burning practice. Observations have shown that when burning was banned, natural enemy populations increased and damage due to borers was reduced. C. sacchariphagus and Galleria mellonella eggs are used to trap egg-parasitoids in the field in order to identify parasitoids and to examine their population dynamics. Natural parasitism of borer eggs is about 30 - 40 %, with maximum parasitism observed from November to February. To date, a single species, Trichogramma chilonis Ishii, has been recovered in sugarcane fields in Reunion. Bionomics of the species and/or strains of Trichogramma collected in the fields are being examined in the laboratory to select appropriate strains for mass production and augmentative release programmes. Field experiments with inundative releases of Trichogramma are planned to test for their efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Maize is {{the staple}} food crop and {{source of income}} for {{majority}} of the Kenyan population and many sub-Saharan African countries. The increasing Kenyan population demands an increase in maize production if intermittent food deficits have to be averted. Since the introduction of improved maize varieties in mid- 1960, the start of Green Revolution period, maize yields increased drastically up to 1970 s and started declining from 1980 s to-date. The key contributory factors are nutrient mining, sub-optimal input use and insect pest damage. Of the insect pests, <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> is of economic importance. Currently, KARI and CIMMYT are developing maize varieties that are tolerant to <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> damage. In order to evaluate the potential impact of these interventions economics of <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> control at farm level was evaluated. Surveys complemented with on-farm trials were executed in six major maize growing zones of Kenya. Farmers were randomly selected and a sample-frame established after which a total of 1854 households were randomly selected using random sampling technique. Each household was interviewed using structured questionnaire. Data on method of <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> control and the type insecticides used was collected.

A fifth-instar <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> that survives to pupation {{would be expected to}} produce a tunnel 15. 8 cm long. Although tunneling shortens internodes at and above the tunnel, yield loss varied by year. A six-class scale was developed to evaluate injury. The average injury rating for a plot declined 0. 332 ± 0. 033 points per leaf stage. In years of adequate rainfall, yields declined linearly as plants were attacked later in development. Injury profiles were developed to describe feeding injury. Plot yield losses seem to be moderated by the ability of uninfested or slightly injured plants to compensate for severe <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> injury. Regression models were developed to predict plot yield and individual plant yield. Models for individual plant yield were combined with injury profiles to predict grain yield as a function of percentage of plants injured and corn development stage. Economic injury levels and economic thresholds were determined and a management program was presented. In a second study, degree-day models were used to time insecticide applications (permethrin) to egg hatch and larval movement. Although applications at egg hatch significantly reduced <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> density in grass terraces by 54 - 85 %, applications timed with movement were more effective in reducing severe damage to corn.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesWhite maize is {{the staple}} food of the {{majority}} of the South African population. We examine if smallholder farmers that adopted insect-resistant (Bt) varieties of white maize benefited from planting Bt over the last three seasons. Commercial farmers are known to benefit from planting Bt maize in high <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> or corn borer infestation years, but when planted in locations or years when <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> are not a problem, Bt will usually not be profitable because of higher seed costs. In the first two production seasons, small farmers enjoyed higher yields with Bt maize than with conventional hybrid varieties despite lower-than-normal (yet still significant) <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> pressure and less-than-ideal maize production conditions. Yield is expressed according to grain per kilogram of seed planted, as seeding rates per land area differ drastically between small-scale farmers.
