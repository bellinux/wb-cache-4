5|$|When {{the first}} set of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924, most of legislative Route5 north of Oneonta—including the section between Richfield <b>Springs</b> <b>and</b> Mohawk—became part of NY28, which originally began in Oneonta and headed north through Richfield <b>Springs</b> <b>and</b> Mohawk before ending in Utica. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the section of NY28 between Richfield <b>Springs</b> <b>and</b> Mohawk was moved onto a new highway to the west that went directly between the two locations. The portion of its former routing between Richfield <b>Springs</b> <b>and</b> Paines Hollow became part of the new NY167, which continued north from Paines Hollow to Dolgeville via Little Falls and old legislative Route37.|$|E

5|$|The {{piece of}} NY167 between Richfield <b>Springs</b> <b>and</b> Paines Hollow, a small hamlet {{southwest}} of Little Falls, was originally {{part of an}} unsigned legislative route in the early 20th century.

In 1924, the Richfield Springs–Paines Hollow route became part of NY28; however, that route was altered as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to follow a new alignment to the west. NY28's former routing between Richfield <b>Springs</b> <b>and</b> Paines Hollow became part of the new NY167, which continued north through Little Falls to Dolgeville as it does today.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, M-57 was {{designated}} from M-66 (now M-91) near Langston to M-47 (now M-52) in St. Charles. By the mid 1936, the section between Ithaca and St. Charles {{was removed from}} the state highway system when the designation was shifted south to run between Ashley and Chesaning. In the process, M-57 was run concurrently along US27 between Ithaca and Ashley. The western section was similarly shifting by May 1938. The new routing started at a junction with US131 between Rockford and Cedar <b>Springs</b> <b>and</b> continued through Greenville and Carson City to Ashley. The eastern end was also extended from Chesaning to the Clio area. It was extended a second time by early 1941 to a junction with Belsay Road. By the middle of 1946, the eastern end was extended a third time to end in Otisville. M-57 was lengthened after a western extension in late 1948 or early 1949.
