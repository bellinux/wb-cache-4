Stone column {{is one of the}} ground improvement techniques to improve the soft soil strength. Bottom ash, as a residue of coal combustion from coal power plants, has similar properties with sand and potentially use as stone columns. The utilization of the industrial by-products is recognized nowadays due to the continuous dwindling of non-renewable natural materials. Furthermore, the large production of bottom ash from coal burning in Malaysia has results in waste issues. So, by using bottom ash column, the disposal problem for bottom ash could extensively be reduced.
