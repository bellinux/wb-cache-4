5|$|In {{contrast}} to dualism, monism {{does not accept}} any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia. In Indian and Chinese philosophy, monism is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are physicalist. Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> term to be clarified by our best science. However, a variety of formulations (see below) are possible. Another form of monism, idealism, states that the only existing substance is mental. Although pure idealism, {{such as that of}} George Berkeley, is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called panpsychism, according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and David Ray Griffin.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{strove to}} be a painter of rural life and nature, and {{during his first}} summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and {{traditional}} rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led {{him to try to}} capture a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols. His renditions of the sower, at first copied from Jean-François Millet, reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun. These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian iconography he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint The Sower.|$|E

500|$|In the 1980s, Asch was {{disappointed}} and {{concerned by the}} direction social psychology was taking. He wrote, [...] "Why do I sense, together with the current expansion, a shrinking of vision, an expansion of surface rather than depth, a failure of imagination?....Why is not social psychology more exciting, more human in the most usual <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> term? To sum up, is this discipline perhaps on the wrong track?" [...] (Asch, p. x) Asch was worried that social psychologists were not asking the deeper questions that would help change and improve the world.|$|E
500|$|The New Yorkers David Denby {{felt the}} new version of Hairspray was [...] "perfectly pleasant," [...] but {{compared}} unfavorably to the Broadway musical, since [...] " [...] have removed the traces of camp humor and Broadway blue that gave the stage show its happily knowing flavor." [...] Denby criticized the dance numbers, calling them [...] "unimaginatively shot," [...] and he considered [...] "the idea of substituting John Travolta for Harvey Fierstein as Tracy’s hefty mother... a blandly earnest betrayal." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com found Hairspray [...] "reasonably entertaining. But {{do we really need}} to be entertained reasonably? Waters' original was a crazy sprawl that made perfect sense; this Hairspray toils needlessly to make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> craziness, and something gets lost in the translation." [...] Zacharek was also displeased with the way Latifah's performance of [...] "I Know Where I've Been" [...] was incorporated into the movie, saying [...] "The filmmakers may believe they're adding an extra layer of seriousness to the material... the inclusion of this big production number only suggests that the filmmakers fear the audience won't get the movie's message unless it's spelled out for them." ...|$|E
500|$|Initial work on Grand Theft Auto V {{constituted}} the open world creation, where preliminary models were constructed in-engine during pre-production. The game's setting is the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas and city of Los Santos, based on Southern California and Los Angeles respectively. San Andreas {{was first used}} as [...] setting, which featured three cities separated by open countryside. The team thought that the ambition of including three cities in San Andreas was too great, as it did not emulate the cities {{as well as they}} had hoped. Houser felt that [...] "to do a proper version of L.A....the game has to give you a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sprawlif not completely replicate it", and that dividing the budget and manpower between multiple cities would have detracted from capturing [...] "what L.A. is". Garbut said that PlayStation 2 era technology lacked the technical capabilities to capture Los Angeles properly, such that San Andreas rendition of Los Santos looked like a [...] "backdrop or a game level with pedestrians randomly milling about". The team disregarded San Andreas as a departure point for Grand Theft Auto V because they had moved on to a new generation of consoles and wanted to build the city from scratch. According to Garbut, with the move to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hardware, [...] "our processes and the fidelity of the world [...] evolved so much from San Andreas" [...] that using it as a model would have been redundant. The team's focus on one city instead of three meant that they could produce Los Santos in higher quality and at greater scale than in the previous game.|$|E

There were, however, a few experiences I cannot forget. One was my first meeting with Heisenberg, who came to America soon {{after the end of}} the Second World War. Our conversation was intimate and he impressed me by his deep religious conviction. He was a true Christian in every <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> word." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first purely English {{alphabetical}} dictionary was A Table Alphabeticall, {{written by}} English schoolteacher Robert Cawdrey in 1604. The only surviving copy is {{found at the}} Bodleian Library in Oxford. This dictionary, and the many imitators which followed it, was seen as unreliable and nowhere near definitive. Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield was still lamenting in 1754, 150 years after Cawdrey's publication, that it is [...] "a sort of disgrace to our nation, that hitherto we have had no… standard of our language; our dictionaries at present being more properly what our neighbors the Dutch and the Germans call theirs, word-books, than dictionaries in the superior <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> title." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the [...] "historic" [...] view, Ford believes that Ellen White was clear that Christ took our infirmities and with the weaknesses of fallen man, the sinful nature in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> he had a lessened capacity {{with respect to the}} fallen physical nature that he inherited from Adam, including physical weaknesses, frailties and mental, and moral degeneracy and deterioration. [...] While Christ was tempted as all other human beings are, Ford notes that the lessened capacity of his human nature did not ever include giving in to temptation or having any evil desires or propensity or predisposition towards sin in his spiritual nature, a position with which Ellen White taught and mainstream Adventists agree.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first group}} includes, besides the {{languages}} of the Philippines, the Austronesian languages of Taiwan, Sabah, North Sulawesi and Madagascar. It is primarily characterized by the retention of the original system of Philippine-type voice alternations, where typically three or four verb voices determine which semantic role the [...] "subject"/"topic" [...] expresses (it may express either the actor, the patient, the location and the beneficiary, or various other circumstancial roles such as instrument and concomitant). The phenomenon has frequently {{been referred to as}} focus (not {{to be confused with the}} usual <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> term in linguistics). Furthermore, the choice of voice is influenced by the definiteness of the participants. The word order has a strong tendency to be verb-initial.|$|E

2500|$|Similar to his {{friendship}} with Robert Duncan and the painter Jess Collins, Palmer's work with painter Irving Petlin remains generative. Irving's singular influence from the beginning demonstrated for Palmer a [...] "working" [...] of the poet as [...] "maker" [...] (in the radical sense, even ancient <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> word). Along with Duncan, Zukofsky, and others, Petlin's work modeled, demonstrated, circumscribed and, perhaps most importantly for Palmer, verified that [...] "the way" [...] (this way for the artist who is a maker, a creator) would also be, as Gilles Deleuze termed it, [...] "a life". This in turn delineates Palmer's own sense of both a poetics and an ongoing counter-poetic tradition, offering him fixture and a place of repair.|$|E
2500|$|Chibnall {{was adamant}} that Broadchurch {{not be a}} [...] "whodunit". His concept was to show how a murder [...] "makes victims of the whole {{community}} {{in all sorts of}} different ways. Some of them are able to deal with that and recover from that and build something from it; for some people it means they're destroyed by that so I wanted to look basically at a whole set of characters affected by this one devastating event and the different effects it had on people, so it really made <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> and played straight into that central idea." [...] His scripts then focused on {{what it would be like}} for each character to live through an actual murder investigation and its aftermath. This required removing as much police procedure from the scripts as possible, and focusing on character development.|$|E
2500|$|Mitchell's {{approach}} to music {{struck a chord}} with many female listeners. In an era dominated by the stereotypical male rock star, she presented herself as [...] "multidimensional and conflicted... allow her to build such a powerful identification among her female fans". Mitchell asserted her desire for artistic control throughout her career, and still holds the publishing rights for her music. While she has disclaimed the notion {{that she is a}} [...] "feminist", David Shumway notes that [...] "she became the first woman in popular music to be recognized as an artist in the full <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> term." [...] In a 2013 interview she emphatically rejected feminism, stating: [...] "I'm not a feminist. I don't want to get a posse against men. I'd rather go toe-to-toe; work it out." [...] Whatever Mitchell's stated views of feminism, what she represents more than any other performer of her era is the new prominence of women's perspectives in cultural and political life." ...|$|E

2500|$|The en banc Federal Circuit {{upheld the}} rejection, 9–3. The {{majority}} opinion by Chief Judge Paul Redmond Michel characterized {{the issue as}} whether the claimed method is a patent-eligible [...] "process," [...] as the patent statute (35 U.S.C. § 101) uses that term. While any series of actions or operations is a process in the dictionary <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> term, the court explained, the Supreme Court has held that the statutory meaning is narrower than the dictionary meaning which [...] "forecloses a purely literal reading." [...] Patent-eligible processes do not include [...] "laws of nature, natural phenomena, [...] abstract ideas." [...] The limiting legal principle applies not just to processes, but to anything on which a patent is sought. As a trilogy of Supreme Court decisions on patent-eligibility from approximately three decades ago had taught, [...] "Phenomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work." [...] Therefore, the question was whether Bilski's process fell within any of the prohibited categories (that is, was a claim to a [...] "principle"), and the underlying legal question was what legal tests or criteria should govern that determination when a claim is directed to a principle.|$|E
2500|$|The role of {{the emperor}} of Brazil was to {{represent}} the nation. He represented that which the nation had [...] "of oneness, of permanence, of stability. He represented the legal order, the unity of all Brazilians, {{as well as the}} variations of region, class, party, race, represented the nation in its totality." [...] The monarch was in reality a type of [...] "minister of a republic", in the philosophical <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> last word, from res publica, and not a sovereign by divine right. His function {{as a representative of the}} nation, of its legitimacy, derived not from being elected, but acclaimed, as had traditionally happened for centuries after the death of the previous monarch in homage to his successor. Acclamation was a popular designation that legitimated the {{role of the}} monarchy as representative of the Brazilian people. This in fact occurred at three distinct historic moments during the monarchical era: in 1822, when Pedro I was acclaimed, in 1831 and finally in 1840, when it was the turn of Pedro II be acclaimed in all the provinces. Acclamation was, in a certain way, a type of symbolic vote, equivalent to an informal plebiscite. It was popular acceptance that granted the legitimacy to Brazilian monarchs as representatives of the Nation.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2004, Putin said: [...] "It is my deep {{conviction}} that {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union was a national tragedy on a massive scale. I think the ordinary citizens of the former Soviet Union and the citizens in the post-Soviet space, the CIS countries, have gained nothing from it. On the contrary, people have been faced with a host of problems." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Incidentally, at that period, too, opinions varied, including among the leaders of the Union republics. For example, Nursultan Nazarbayev was categorically opposed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and he said so openly proposing various formulas for preserving the state within the common borders. But, I repeat, all that is in the past. Today we should look at the situation in which we live. One cannot keep looking back and fretting about it: we should look forward." [...] In December 2007, he said in the interview to the Time magazine: [...] "Russia is an ancient country with historical, profound traditions and a very powerful moral foundation. And this foundation is a love for the Motherland and patriotism. Patriotism in the best <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> word.
