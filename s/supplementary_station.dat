While {{a number of}} studies have investigated the consequences of surplus food on the population dynamics of scavengers, relatively little is known about the effects of such practices at the individual level. Within the long-term monitored breeding population of Canarian Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus majorensis) we investigated individual bird’s patterns of use of a <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>station</b> at Fuerteventura (Canary Islands), over the course of breeding (2001, 2002; 2004 - 2011) and non-breeding seasons (2000 - 2010). Our results show that during the breeding season the individual use of the <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>station</b> was inversely related to the distance to the breeding territory, which suggests the existence of central-place foraging constraints. In addition, larger birds of poor body-condition and individuals that ultimately failed to fledge young were detected more frequently at the feeding station. During the non-breeding season, and because most breeding birds abandoned the breeding territories, the overall abundance of Egyptian vultures at the feeding station grew. Moreover, the only variable increasing the probability of presence of individuals was poor body condition so that birds with lower wing residual visited the feeding <b>station</b> more frequently. <b>Supplementary</b> feeding may benefit individuals who would otherwise have been subject to selective pressures. From our results it follows that this conservation strategy must be used with caution because it can have consequences on an individual level and thus potentially affect the viability of endangered populations...|$|R

40|$|Moose {{browsing}} {{pressure in}} the vicinity of <b>supplementary</b> winter feeding <b>stations</b> eventually declines over time. It is believed that continual winter browsing over multiple years causes locally reduced shoot growth and forage availability for moose (Alces alces).

This increase in shoot size was probably not related directly to browsing, but to higher nutrient and light availability associated with moose activity at feeding stations. Increased use of Norway spruce, yet reduced browsing overall at feeding stations, probably reflects the overall decline in abundance of preferred Scots pine and downy birch in a local environment substantially altered by an artificially and abnormally high density of moos...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo {{determine}} the regional shear wave velocities in the lithosphere it is frequently necessary to use two-station dispersion curves. We investigate {{the influence of}} non-plane wave energy on such dispersion curves, and compare them to two other better known sources of error: deviations from great-circle paths and uncorrelated noise. To study the influence of non-plane waves created from distant heterogeneities we create complex wavefields in a laterally homogeneous medium by adding interfering waves to a main plane wave. We then calculate the apparent phase velocity between two seismic stations located 100 – 400 km apart. Using realistic values for the sources of error, we conclude that the contribution of each is similar for 200 -km-long profiles. Our conclusions on non-plane waves are made {{under the assumption that}} non-plane energy from distant heterogeneities varies randomly with hypocentre location. If this is correct, then only five to 10 events with different hypocentres are required to obtain a stable dispersion curve with less than 1 per cent error. The influence of uncorrelated noise and non-plane waves diminish for longer profiles, while the errors due to great-circle deviations are independent of profile length and systematically bias the dispersion curve to higher velocities. We recommend the inclusion of some off-profile broad-band stations for surface wave studies on a regional scale, because such <b>supplementary</b> <b>stations</b> make it possible to apply first-order corrections for off great-circle propagation. The strong influence from the different sources of error, combined with our lack of precise knowledge of the nature and amplitude of non-plane energy, implies that the interpretation of two-station measurements should be restricted to major changes in regional earth structure...|$|R
40|$|Chance per se plays a {{key role}} in ecology and evolution, e. g., genetic mutation, {{resource}} spatiotemporal unpredictability. In community ecology, chance is recognized as a key factor in community assemblage, but less is known about its role in intraguild processes leading to species coexistence. Here we study the relevance of resource unpredictability per se as a promoter of intraguild positive interspecific interactions and as a biodiversity enhancer in an Old World avian scavenger guild, which has evolved to feed upon spatially and temporally unpredictable resources, i. e., carcasses. We performed a large-scale field experiment in which 58 carcasses were disposed of and observed until complete consumption, either in continuously active <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>stations</b> (predictable carcasses) or disposed of at random in the field (unpredictable carcasses). Richness of scavenger species was similar at unpredictable and predictable carcasses, but their relative abundances were highly uneven at predictable carcasses leading to higher scavenger diversity (Shannon index) at unpredictable carcasses. Facilitatory interspecific processes only occurred at unpredictable resources but were disrupted in predictable conditions because the dominant specialist species (in our case, the Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus) arrived earlier and in larger numbers, monopolizing the resource. Small, endangered scavengers congregated at <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>stations</b> but profited less compared to unpredictable carcasses, suggesting that they could constitute an ecological trap. Our findings offer new insights into the relevance of unpredictability of trophic resources in promoting both positive facilitatory interspecific interactions and species diversity and thus maintaining the function of guilds. Finally, the preservation of randomness in resource availability and the processes associated with its exploitation should be a major goal of conservation strategies aimed to preserve scavenger guilds evolved under naturally unpredictable trophic resources.

40|$|From June through August 1967, a {{thorough}} investigation {{was made of the}} presence and numbers of coliform bacteria, fecal streptococci (enterococci), and bacteria capable of growing on peptone-seawater agar at 28 °. Six regularly monitored <b>stations</b> and several <b>supplementary</b> <b>stations</b> were established in the middle and southern sections of Kaneohe Bay. The latter receives considerably treated sewage effluent and some untreated sewage. In addition, analysis was made of sewage and sewage effluent from the Kaneohe municipal sewage plant, the Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station (KMCAS) sewage plant, and Coconut Island. Water from several small streams along the middle sector of the Bay was also tested. The fecal bacteria count was below the maximum set for Class AA water (according to the water quality standards proposed for the State of Hawaii) at all the regular stations on all occasions. The sewage treatment plants did not discharge any significant numbers of living microorganisms into the Bay; actually, the effluent from the Kaneohe municipal plant was found to be sterile after chlorination. The total count of bacteria in the Bay was generally high, but not alarmingly high. No correlation could be found between the bacterial count and the existing weather and tide conditions. In contrast to the low count of fecal bacteria {{in most parts of the}} Bay, rather high counts of coliforms, and especially enterococci, were found at several stations in shallow water in the middle sector. The sources of this contamination were found to be several of the small streams emptying into the Bay at this point. The streams from Kahaluu to Molii, as well as the shallow water of the Bay along the corresponding coastline, were all found to meet the proposed standards of Class II fresh water, however.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{consequences of}} spatio-temporal distribution and abundance of trophic resources have received significant attention in ecology {{due to their}} predicted effects at the individual, population and community levels. Pulses are defined as occasional episodes of food abundance concentrated in space and time. Although these phenomena are common in many ecosystems {{we still have a}} limited understanding about their effects on the dynamics and functioning of guilds and vertebrate communities. To explore these issues we carried out research using carcasses and scavenger guilds as a study model. Carcasses are a paradigmatic pulsed resource that under natural conditions appears unpredictable. They are exploited by guilds of organisms ranging from bacteria to vultures and large carnivores. However, human activities (including certain conservation strategies) change the unpredictable conditions with foreseeable consequences in the structure and functioning of scavenger guilds. In this scenario, the main aims of this thesis were: 1) to explore the role of unpredictability (randomness) as a driver of both the diversity and the existence of facilitatory processes within an avian scavenger guild and 2) to detect the ecological consequences that occur when trophic resources become predictable, both for scavengers and for non-scavenger species. We explored the second goal using <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>stations</b> (vulture restaurants) as our study model. Thus our results are not only of ecological significance, but can also be of great utility for the management and conservation of these species. We found that unpredictable (random) distribution of carcasses favours the diversity of scavengers and promotes the existence of intraguild facilitatory processes. Moreover, through a transcontinental approach we found that migrant scavengers change their spatial distribution patterns between the breeding (in Europe) and the wintering areas (in Africa) consistently following the degree of food aggregation. Moreover, we detect higher overlap in interspecific diets in Europe, where resources are scarce, clumped and predictable. The availability of long-lasting carcasses provokes the aggregation of large numbers of facultative scavengers, increasing the risk of predation on other vertebrates that live around these areas. Finally, we examined conservation consequences of the concentration of carcasses at <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>stations</b> (vulture restaurants) promoted by current European sanitary legislation. We found that clumped and predictable food resources cause the co-occurrence of scavenger species at these points provoking an overlap in their diets, which is otherwise segregated. Moreover, <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>stations</b> favour the gathering of individuals of the dominant species (the griffon vulture Gyps fulvus), which monopolize food to the detriment of small scavengers of conservation concern. To minimize these negative effects we provide guidelines for an appropriate design and propose that adaptive management is key for the most effective application of this widely used conservation tool. In conclusion, this study shows that changes in the distribution and predictability of food resources have important consequences for the structure and functioning of the scavenger guilds as well as other vertebrate communities not directly related to the exploitation of this resource. Studies such as this thesis, which deal with the issue from different perspectives (including those relating to conservation) are particularly relevant in understanding the phenomenon.

40|$|Large avian {{scavengers}} {{are among}} the most vulnerable vertebrates, and many of their populations have declined severely in recent decades. To help mitigate this marked reduction in abundance, <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>stations</b> (SFS; colloquially termed “vulture restaurants”) have been created worldwide, often without consideration of the scientific evidence supporting the suitability of the practice. SFS have been effective and important tools for conservation and reintroduction of avian scavengers. However, negative consequences can result from large aggregations of individual birds, disrupting intraguild processes and promoting density-dependent decreases in productivity. At the community level, SFS favor the congregation of predators (ie facultative scavengers), increasing predation risk on small- and medium- sized vertebrates {{in the vicinity of the}} SFS. These feeding stations might also affect processes of natural selection and even render populations maladapted to their natural environments. We also examine future scenarios for avian scavengers in relation to ecosystem services, to changes in agro-grazing economies and in land uses, and ultimately to rewilding landscapes where SFS play a controversial role...|$|R
