40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis project identifies current sources of <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> and <b>cost</b> avoidance generated through Army foreign military sales (FMS). Using a comparative high-low case-study approach, a high-demand volume case and a low-demand volume case were selected in major weapons categories. The cases were analyzed on an internal basis to determine <b>cost</b> <b>savings,</b> <b>cost</b> avoidance, and public value. Once the cases were analyzed and compared against each other, advantages or trends in <b>cost</b> <b>savings,</b> <b>cost</b> avoidance, and public value became apparent. Upon completion of our analysis, we determined that <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> were usually gained from reduced system unit costs due to higher economic order quantities, reduced overhead costs per unit, and reduced unit costs resulting from manufacturing learning curves. Additional costs were avoided by reducing gaps in production lines. Furthermore, we {{determined that the}} Army’s FMS strategy needs improvement {{in order to take}} full advantage of these sources of <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> and <b>cost</b> avoidance.

50|$|Leaf springs {{were very}} common on automobiles, {{right up to}} the 1970s in Europe and Japan and late 1970s in America when the move to front-wheel drive, and more {{sophisticated}} suspension designs saw automobile manufacturers use coil springs instead. Today leaf springs are still used in heavy commercial vehicles such as vans and trucks, SUVs, and railway carriages. For heavy vehicles, they have the advantage of spreading the load more widely over the vehicle's chassis, whereas coil springs transfer it to a single point. Unlike coil springs, leaf springs also locate the rear axle, eliminating the need for trailing arms and a Panhard rod, thereby <b>saving</b> <b>cost</b> and weight in a simple live axle rear suspension.

50|$|Condition Monitoring (CM) {{is the use}} {{of sensors}} in {{equipment}} to gather data and enable users to centrally monitor the data in real-time. Predictive Maintenance (PM) applies analytical models and rules against the data to proactively predict an impending issue; then deliver recommendations to operations, maintenance and IT departments to address the issue. These capabilities enable new ways to monitor the operation of the equipment - such as turbines and generators - and processes and to adopt proactive maintenance and repair procedures rather than fixed schedule-based procedures, potentially saving money on maintenance and repair, and <b>saving</b> <b>cost</b> and lost productivity of downtime caused by equipment failures. Furthermore, combining sensor data from multiple pieces of equipment and/or multiple processes can provide deeper insight into the overall impact of faulty or sub-optimal equipment, allowing organizations to identify and resolve problems before they impact operations and improve the quality and efficiency of industrial processes.|$|E

Methods: A Prospective, standard care-controlled study design was used to compare <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> and <b>cost</b> avoidance of patients receiving care from patient care team (including a clinical pharmacist) versus standard care (no pharmacist on team). All patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit 1 and 2 during the same period were included in the study. The outcome measures were overall drug cost and length of ICU stay. Interventions made by the pharmacist in the study group were documented. The analyses of acceptance and <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> and/or <b>cost</b> avoidance were also performed. Results: A total of 65 patients were admitted to either ICU 1 or 2 during the 5 week- study period. The pharmacist participated in patient care and made total of 127 interventions for the ICU- 1 team. Ninety-eight percent of the interventions were accepted and implemented by physicians. The difference of overall drug cost per patient between two groups was 182. 01 USD (1, 076. 37 USD in study group and 1, 258. 38 USD in control group, p= 0. 138). The average length of ICU stay for the intervention group and the control group was not significantly different (7. 16 days vs. 6. 18 days, p= 0. 995). The 125 accepted interventions were evaluated for <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> and <b>cost</b> avoidance.
