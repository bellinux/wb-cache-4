50|$|In a truck’s {{air brake}} system, relay valves get a signal when a driver presses the treadle, which then opens the valve and allows air {{to enter the}} brake chamber via air inlet. The {{diaphragm}} gets pushed, then the rod, then the slack adjuster which twists to turn the brake camshaft. Next, it moves the disc, wedge or s-cam, which pushes the brake <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> <b>lining,</b> creating friction. This friction slows and eventually stops the brake drum’s turning, which stops the wheel.|$|R

As Olajuwon declared: [...] "How can a poor working mother with three boys buy Nikes or Reeboks that cost $120?...She can't. So kids steal these <b>shoes</b> from stores <b>and</b> from other kids.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{accurately}} calculate the braking efficiency factor of drum brake shoe of heavy truck, virtual prototyping {{of a heavy}} truck's brake is demonstrated. The requirements for brakes include not only its performance but also its comfort, serviceability and working lifetime, which must be high. The finite element analysis software ANSYS and the multi-body system simulation software MSC. ADAMS were used to establish the drum brake nonlinear 3 D simulation model. The model was built by developing joint program module between the rigid <b>shoe</b> <b>and</b> the flexible <b>lining</b> <b>and</b> nonlinear contact force program module between the <b>lining</b> <b>and</b> the rigid drum. Using this model, the simulation was executed for the drum brake of 32 t heavy duty truck. The {{results show that the}} simulated braking efficiency factor coincides with experimental results of the braking efficiency factor of the heavy truck drum brake...|$|R
500|$|After signing Jordan, Falk quickly {{made the}} first great deal for him: the Nike shoe deal.

[...] After James Worthy signed an 8-year, $1.2 million endorsement deal with New Balance in 1982, also negotiated by Falk, Falk decided to make large demands to shoe companies for Jordan's services, including his own <b>shoe</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> a royalty.|$|R

60|$|This {{was so far}} satisfactory. Our three {{travellers}} {{were quite}} charmed with their proficiency in the new mode of progression, when a sudden thaw set in and damped not only their spirits but their <b>shoes.</b> The netting <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> became flabby. The moccasins, with which Hendrick had supplied them from the bundle he carried for his own use, were reduced to something {{of the nature of}} tripe. The damp snow, which when rendered powdery by frost had fallen through the net-work of the shoes, now fell upon it in soft heaps and remained there, increasing the weight so much as to wrench joints and strain muscles, while the higher temperature rendered exertion fatiguing and clothing unbearable.|$|R

The novel was criticized upon release as a ghostwritten work, which prompted its ghostwriter Maya Sloan to reveal that while the Jenner sisters wrote a two-page outline for what they wanted the novel to be like, Sloan was truly responsible for {{the writing of the}} book. However, the Jenners' creative director, Elizabeth Killmond-Roman, clarified that the two had numerous Skype and FaceTime calls with Sloan to discuss the content of the novel.

50|$|In some cases, {{there was}} {{evidence}} of stalking as well; some of Boney's previous victims had reported receiving harassing phone calls for a couple {{months prior to the}} attacks asking them what they were wearing and if they were wearing high heeled shoes. He had previously admitted to police that he had a foot fetish, a detail he later discussed with numerous news outlets. This detail was suspicious to the defense: Kim Camm's <b>shoes</b> were removed <b>and</b> <b>lined</b> up neatly on top of the vehicle {{in the midst of a}} messy crime scene. Kim had a series of bruises and abrasions to the top of both of her feet. Boney was interviewed and took a polygraph, in which he was determined to be deceptive. He denied any involvement, claiming that he donated the sweatshirt to charity and was cleared as a suspect. Two weeks later, his palm print was discovered on Kim's vehicle and he was arrested.|$|R
