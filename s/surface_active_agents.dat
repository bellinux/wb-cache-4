40|$|The {{range of}} {{electrical}} potential of coalescence of aqueous droplets {{in the oil}} phase was studied, and was compared with the electrocapillary phenomena at the oil-water inter-face. The experimental method was {{essentially the same as}} that of the coalescence of mercury droplets mentioned previously. If neither the aqueous nor oil phase contained the <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> material, aqueous droplets in the oiI phase always coalesced over the whole range of the applied electrical potential. On the other hand, when the oil phase contained an ionic <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agent,</b> the repulsion of the aqueous droplets was observed at po-tentials higher than a certain value. This potential was governed by the ionic strength of the oil phase; the range of electricaI potential of coalescence increased with increasing ionic strength of the oil phase. This tendency was similar to that of the coalescence of mercury droplets in the inorganic electrolyte solution. In the Iatter case the coalescence was prevented by the electrostatic repulsion between mercury droplets. When the oil phase contained the nonionic, instead of ionic, <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agent,</b> the condition of coalescence of aqueous droplets was independent of the ionic strength of the oil phase as well as the electrical potential, but depended on the concentration of the nonionic <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agent; the coalescence was prevented only if the concentration of the agent exceeded a certain value. It was thus concluded that aqueous droplets in the nonionic <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agent</b> solution was protected by the adsorbed layer...|$|R
50|$|Foams {{consist of}} two phases, an aqueous phase and a gaseous (air) phase. Foams {{have been used}} in many forms in the history of cooking, for example: whipped cream, ice cream, cakes, meringue, soufflés, mousse and marshmallow.

50|$|Surfactants own both {{hydrophilic}} and lipophilic {{properties in}} one molecule, {{so they are}} called <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents,</b> and are widely used in various washing process. With the lipophilic tails, surfactants are biologically active. Anionic surfactants have the ability of binding to bioactive macromolecules like enzymes, DNA, peptides, causing changes of surface charge and the folding of polypeptide chain(structure of protein). The function of proteins will be different. Cationic surfactant can bind to the inner membrane of bacteria, and by this way disorganize the bacteria through their long alkyl chain. Nonionic surfactants are able to bind to both proteins and phospholipid membrane, leading to leakage of low molecular mass compounds by increasing the permeability of membranes and vesicles. This may result in serious damage in cells or even cell death.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "bio{{surfactant}}" [...] can {{be applied}} to a surfactant that is obtained directly from a natural source (from plant, animal or microbial cells) by some kind of separation procedure such as extraction, precipitation or distillation. These surfactants have recently gained appeal as an alternative to surfactants organically synthesized from petrochemicals. While many bio-surfactants prove to be acceptable substitutes for their synthetic counterparts, often minor chemical processing can alter their properties to meet specific needs. There is debate regarding how much organic synthesis should be involved while still being able to call a given substance a bio-surfactant, but currently the term is not protected and often [...] "bio-based surfactant" [...] is used interchangeably with [...] "bio-surfactant". Since <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> are abundant in nature, the factor that limits the production of bio-surfactants is definitely not their presence, but likely the technological cost of scaled-up production, separation, and purification. In most instances this makes the cost of bio-based surfactants much higher than the cost of their synthetic equivalents. For example, most biological membranes are made up of a phospholipid bilayer which is composed of surfactant molecules having a polar head and non-polar or hydrophobic tail. However while these phospholipids are ubiquitous in nature, their intracellular location and interaction with other cellular components make their recovery and purification difficult and costly. Other than sophorolipids, common biosurfactants include rhamnolipids which can be produced by some species of Pseudomonas, and Lecithin which can be obtained either from soybean or from egg yolk and is a common food ingredient.One of interesting surfactants producing by yeast are cellobiose lipids consist of a residue of cellobiose, the disaccharide composed of two glucose residues linked by a 1,4'-beta-glycoside bond, and fatty acid residue as an aglycone [...]Cellobiose lipids are effective fungicides against many species of ascomycetous and basidiomycetous yeast and mycelial fungi, including human pathogens, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans ...|$|E

40|$|A review. Foam {{is common}} in Fe and {{steelmaking}} processes. Fe and steelmaking slags have inherent foaminess but the presence of strong surface active compounds like P 2 O 5, Cr 2 O 3, CaS, V 2 O 5, and CaF 2 make the foam more stable. Stable foam can form only {{in the presence of}} <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents.</b> When a bubble rises on the surface of a liquid, the film around it develops a concentration gradient of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> such that Marangoni force acts in upward direction. This prevents liquid drainage from the film. The presence of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents</b> favors formation of smaller bubbles and prevents bubble rupture as well. So a strong surface active agent where ds/dc is high makes the foam very stable. When a bubble comes into contact with a solid surface, the dynamic contact angle is different from the equil. value. If the former is less than the latter, there is a resultant outward force which tries to make the bubble flat. This force is responsible for the collapse of foamy slags in the presence of large carbonaceous particles. This force is not significant for very small bubbles and is not effective when carbon particles are much smaller than the bubble...|$|E

The disintegrating effect of tumour emboli into single cells by certain detergents, and the ingenious discovery that the mutual adhesiveness between cancer cells is much less than between normal cells, have led the present authors to investigate the action of some biological <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>agents,</b> alone as well as in some of their associations on the " take " of Yoshida sarcoma implants.
