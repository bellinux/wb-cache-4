5|$|Ewbank {{learned of}} the {{television}} problems {{in the locker room}} when he received a telephone call from his wife congratulating him on a Jets victory – Lucy Ewbank assumed the fact {{that the end of the}} game was not shown meant New York had won. Her husband profanely informed her of the game result. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only Jets relative deceived – cornerback Johnny Sample flew back east after the game on personal business, and when his father picked him up at Philadelphia International Airport, he congratulated his son on a Jets triumph.|$|E
5|$|HMS Lord Nelson {{was laid}} down by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company at Jarrow on 18 May 1905 and {{launched}} on 4 September 1906. Her completion was greatly delayed by the diversion of her 12-inch (305mm) guns and turrets to expedite completion of , {{and she was not}} fully completed until October 1908. Although <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> last pre-dreadnought laid down for the Royal Navy, she was the last one commissioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, she starred opposite a young Cliff Robertson in Autumn Leaves (1956) and filmed {{a leading}} role in The Story of Esther Costello (1957), co-starring Rossano Brazzi. Crawford, who had been left near-penniless following Alfred Steele's death accepted a small role in The Best of Everything (1959). Although <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> star of the film, she received positive reviews. Crawford would later name the role as being one of her personal favorites. However, by the early 1960s, Crawford's status in motion pictures had declined considerably.|$|E

5|$|Babbit {{recruited}} Clea DuVall, who had {{starred in}} her short film Sleeping Beauties, {{to play the}} role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager to work with the director. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.|$|E
5|$|Cather {{discussed}} her authorship {{privately with}} her father and friends, but otherwise said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> author. She was reluctant to discuss most of her work before O Pioneers! (1913). According to L. Brent Bohlke, editor of Willa Cather in Person (1990), Cather regarded the Eddy book as poorly written. While it contains some excellent writing and character analysis, Bohkle wrote, it is not well-structured; the editing had failed to rid {{the book of the}} serialized nature of the McClure's pieces. Stouck adds that Cather wanted to distance herself from journalism, and sought to minimize her role in the articles because they had angered the Christian Science church.|$|E
5|$|Chrystal was the couple's only {{daughter}} among their eight sons. After an early education in Edinburgh she boarded at St Leonards School and St Katharines School for Girls in St Andrews {{on the east}} coast of Scotland. She returned to enroll at the University of Edinburgh in October 1892. Among the first female students there, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first to graduate, as others were more advanced in their studies when they entered as graduate students, and earned Master's degrees before she finished her undergraduate work. Macmillan studied science subjects including Honours Mathematics with George Chrystal, Astronomy with Ralph Copeland, and Natural Philosophy with Peter Guthrie Tait and Cargill Gilston Knott. She earned her Bachelor of Science degree in April 1896, the first woman at Edinburgh to do so.|$|E

50|$|From that moment, Luz María {{must fight}} the hardest battle of her life: to {{convince}} Bruno that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> calculating gold-digger he thinks <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> {{and that her}} love is true.|$|R
5|$|Liz goes to {{the reunion}} but learns that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> quiet, lonely nerd she thought, but the angry bully {{everyone}} hated. Jack {{in search of a}} drink ends up at the reunion as well, and is mistaken for a former popular student Larry Braverman and still unhappy with Geiss' decision, takes on the persona. Liz tries to regain the friendship of her classmates—Kelsey Whintrop (Robyn Lively), Erin O'Neil (Diane Neal), Rob Sussman (Steve Witting), and Diane (Susan Barrett)—without success. Jack, as Larry Braverman, persuades them to like Liz, until an ex-girlfriend (Janel Moloney) of Larry's reveals he has a son, at which point Jack confesses he is not Larry and Liz and Jack both make a quick escape whilst being booed off stage; Liz happily going back to mistreating her former classmates after they attempt to reenact the pig's blood scene from Carrie on her.|$|E
5|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> {{first woman}} balloonist. On 20 May 1784, the Marchioness and Countess of Montalembert, the Countess of Podenas and a Miss de Lagarde {{had taken a}} trip on a {{tethered}} balloon in Paris. Neither was she {{the first woman to}} ascend in an untethered balloon: in Blanchard's time, Citoyenne Henri, who had made an ascent with André-Jacques Garnerin in 1798, was widely credited with that ballooning first, although the honour actually belonged to Elizabeth Thible. Thible, an opera singer, had made an ascent to entertain Gustav III of Sweden in Lyon on 4 June 1784, fourteen years before Citoyenne Henri. Blanchard was, however, the first woman to pilot her own balloon and the first to adopt ballooning as a career.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} website had over 11,000 {{responses to a}} poll asking listeners whether Ruth should go with Sam, compared to the usual 3,000. Fifty-two per cent of the listeners thought Ruth should go to Sam. The Archers website had received 1.2 million page impressions due to the storyline in 2006. In February 2007, {{a writer for the}} Daily Record reported almost 200,000 listeners had deserted The Archers due to controversial storylines, such as Ruth and Sam's affair. The writer said figures for the last three months of 2006, when the Ruth and Sam storyline peaked, revealed 4.44 million listeners tuned in, which was down 169,000 on the previous quarter. Whitburn told Midgley that the backlash from listeners helped keep Ruth faithful to David, and agreed that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> type to have an affair.|$|E

[...] "There is a tactile, visceral quality to The Milkmaid [...] - [...] {{you can almost}} taste the thick, creamy milk escaping the jug, feel the cool dampness {{of the room and}} the starchy linen of the maid's white cap, touch her sculptural shoulders and corseted waist. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an apparition or abstraction. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> ideal, worldly housewife of Vermeer's later Young Woman with a Water Pitcher or the ethereal beauty in Girl with a Pearl Earring. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> cartoonish buxom vixen in Leyden's drawing. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> real [...] - [...] as real as a painting can get anyway." ...|$|R
50|$|Rebecca Lacey (born 20 April 1965) is a British actress. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> born in Watford, Hertfordshire, England, the {{daughter}} of actor Ronald Lacey and actress Mela White. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> sister of actress Ingrid Lacey as is often reported.|$|R
50|$|After the {{introduction}} of the women’s 3000m team pursuit at the 2007-08 track cycling season, Pieters was five times part of the team pursuit squad when they established a new Dutch national record. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> record holder anymore.|$|R
25|$|In the 1990s, Shields {{promoted}} {{physical fitness}} {{as an extension}} of femininity, maintaining that femininity and athletics are compatible. Although <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only woman doing so, Shields had what was required to promote women's athletics.|$|E

25|$|Even if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> chief queen, Hla Wun {{quickly became}} the king's most trusted confidant and adviser. Chronicles recount several {{instances}} when she advised the king (even {{if he did not}} always take her advice). Her first key advice was to recall Yazathingyan to put down the rebellions. The king, who had just exiled the old minister, grudgingly agreed to her advice in 1258. Yazathingyan went on to put down the rebellions.|$|E
50|$|Bobby and {{his band}} later {{try to come up}} with new songs for the concert. Since Bobby doesn't write his own songs, this is very challenging. He comes up with mediocre songs called “My Feet Are So Nice” and “I Love My Hair”. His bandmate's girlfriend, Rita, tells him how silly the songs are, and he just {{continues}} to tell her that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> boss of the feet or the hair song and that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in <b>the</b> band.|$|R
50|$|Raya - Nicknamed Sun Rayz. Light blue eyes, tan skin tone, blonde hair. Introduced in July 2015 as {{the fifth}} main {{character}}.

25|$|Her {{voice had}} a {{distinctive}} character which the Italians call a lirico spinto, marked by its quick vibrato, incisive diction, intensity of attack and unwavering emotional impact. During her career she performed {{with many of the}} contemporary greats of opera—Beniamino Gigli, Claudia Muzio, Jussi Björling, and Franco Corelli. She worked with some of the best conductors of her time, but it is her work with Toscanini that has endured. Despite her talent and numerous performances, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> best known of her contemporaries, overshadowed in her day by Zinka Milanov, Maria Callas, Victoria de los Ángeles and Renata Tebaldi.|$|E
25|$|Even {{during their}} lifetimes, their {{depiction}} {{in the press}} was at considerable odds with the hardscrabble reality of their life on the road, especially for Bonnie Parker. While she was present at one hundred or more felonies during the two years she was Barrow's companion, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> cigar-smoking, machine gun-wielding killer depicted in the newspapers, newsreels, and pulp detective magazines of the day. Gang member W. D. Jones later testified he could not recall ever having seen her shoot at a law officer, and the cigar myth {{grew out of a}} playful snapshot police found at an abandoned hideout. It was released to the press and published nationwide. While Parker did chain smoke Camel cigarettes, she never smoked cigars.|$|E
25|$|A 1962 {{appearance}} {{on a book}} review show on {{what was then the}} National Educational Television (NET) station of Boston, WGBH-TV (now a major Public Broadcasting Service station), led to the inception of her first television cooking show after viewers enjoyed her demonstration of how to cook an omelette. The French Chef had its debut on February 11, 1963, on WGBH and was immediately successful. The show ran nationally for ten years and won Peabody and Emmy Awards, including the first Emmy award for an educational program. Though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first television cook, Child was the most widely seen. She attracted the broadest audience with her cheery enthusiasm, distinctively warbly voice, and unpatronizing and unaffected manner. In 1972, The French Chef became the first television program to be captioned for the deaf, even though this was done using the preliminary technology of open-captioning.|$|E
50|$|Hikari is {{a member}} of the photo club. She chooses not to take {{portrait}} shots, specializing instead in landscape/scenery and astronomy photos. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> type to engage in small talk and therefore is mostly seen by herself. She rarely smiles and is prone to sarcastic comments.|$|R

25|$|Due to his age {{and declining}} health, Garrison retired from the Board of Education {{in the summer of}} 1967. The city's new Mayor, John Lindsay, {{appointed}} Garrison to a Mayor's Advisory Panel on the Decentralization of the New York City Schools. The Advisory Panel recommended extensive devolution of control over the city's public schools to locally elected neighborhood school boards. One locally controlled board in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville neighborhood began violating the union's contract in order to bring in a new teaching staff. This led to three strikes which engulfed the entire city school system. The devolution experiment ended after the strikes. The result was not unsurprising. Garrison had chaired a highly structured public hearing on devolution in 1966. After a local African American woman attempted to speak (even though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> witness list), Garrison ruled her out of order—causing the hearing to dissolve into a near-riot which required police (and for Garrison and the other Board members to scurry out a back door for their own safety).|$|E
25|$|Prior to Game 3 of the 1995 World Series, Cleveland Indians slugger Albert Belle {{unleashed}} a profanity-laced tirade at NBC reporter Hannah Storm {{as she was}} waiting in the Indians' dugout for a prearranged interview with Indians lead-off man, Kenny Lofton. On the same day, Belle snapped at a photographer near the first base line during batting practice. Belle was ultimately fined US$50,000 for his behavior towards Storm. This particular World Series was remembered for baseball television history being made twice by Storm. Prior to Game 2, she became the first female sportscaster to serve as solo host of a World Series game, and after Game 6 she would be the first female sportscaster to preside over the presentation of the Commissioner's Trophy to the World Series champions. However, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first female sportscaster to cover the World Series: that honor fell to CBS Sports reporter Lesley Visser, who served as a field reporter for the Series from 1990 to 1993. She would also cover that same World Series but for a different network, ABC Sports.|$|E
