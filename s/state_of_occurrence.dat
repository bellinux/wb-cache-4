40|$|Changes in the {{metastability}} of the Southern Hemisphere 500 -hPa circulation {{are examined}} using both cluster analysis techniques and split-flow blocking indices. The cluster methodology is a purely data-driven approach for parameterization whereby a multiscale approximation to nonstationary dynamical processes is achieved through optimal sequences of locally stationary fast vector autoregressive factor (VARX) processes and some slow (or persistent) hidden process switching between them. Comparison {{is made with}} blocking indices commonly used in weather forecasting and climate analysis to identify dynamically relevant metastable regimes in the 500 -hPa circulation in both reanalysis and Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) datasets. The analysis characterizes the metastable regime in both reanalysis and model datasets prior to 1978 as positive and negative phases of a hemispheric midlatitude blocking state with the southern annular mode (SAM) associated with a transition state. Post- 1978, the SAM emerges as a true metastable state replacing the negative phase of the hemispheric blocking pattern. The hidden <b>state</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>occurrences</b> exhibits strong trends. The blocking pattern dominates in the early 1980 s, and then gradually decreases. There is a corresponding increase in the SAM frequency <b>of</b> <b>occurrence.</b> This trend is largely evident in the reanalysis summer and spring but was not evident in the AMIP dataset. Further comparison with the split-flow blocking indices reveals a superficial correspondence between the cluster hidden <b>state</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>occurrences</b> and split-flow indices.

Some problems and aspects of fog modeling, parameterization, and forecasting are outlined and discussed on the examples of newly developed relevant 1 D/ 3 D theoretical models. Important issues of fog impacts on the air quality, ecosystems, water basins, societal life, and human health are also addressed and discussed, particularly in cases of anthropogenically modified (chemical, radioactive, etc.) fogs.

40|$|Documenting {{changes in}} {{distribution}} {{is necessary for}} understanding species' response to environmental changes, but data on species distributions are heterogeneous in accuracy and resolution. Combining different data sources and methodological approaches can fill gaps in knowledge about the dynamic processes driving changes in species-rich, but data-poor regions. We combined recent bird survey data from the Neotropical Biodiversity Mapping Initiative (NeoMaps) with historical distribution records to estimate potential changes {{in the distribution of}} eight species of Amazon parrots in Venezuela. Using environmental covariates and presence-only data from museum collections and the literature, we first used maximum likelihood to fit a species distribution model (SDM) estimating a historical maximum probability of occurrence for each species. We then used recent, NeoMaps survey data to build single-season occupancy models (OM) with the same environmental covariates, as well as with time- and effort-dependent detectability, resulting in estimates of the current probability of occurrence. We finally calculated the disagreement between predictions as a matrix of probability of change in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence.</b> Our results suggested negative changes for the only restricted, threatened species, Amazona barbadensis, which has been independently confirmed with field studies. Two of the three remaining widespread species that were detected, Amazona amazonica, Amazona ochrocephala, also had a high probability of negative changes in northern Venezuela, but results were not conclusive for Amazona farinosa. The four remaining species were undetected in recent field surveys; three of these were most probably absent from the survey locations (Amazona autumnalis, Amazona mercenaria and Amazona festiva), while a fourth (Amazona dufresniana) requires more intensive targeted sampling to estimate its current status. Our approach is unique in taking full advantage of available, but limited data, and in detecting a high probability of change even for rare and patchily-distributed species. However, it is presently limited to species meeting the strong assumptions required for maximum-likelihood estimation with presence-only data, including very high detectability and representative sampling of its historical distribution...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} carries final {{figures on}} the reported incidence of notifiable diseases in 1975. Data are submitted to the Center for Disease Control by the individual States through the National Morbidity Reporting System and are supplemented by surveillance activities of the Bureau of Epidemiology and Bureau of State Services at CDC, {{as well as the}} National Center for Health Statistics, Health Services Administration. Totals for the United States do not include data from Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The population figures for 1977 used in computing rates are from the Bureau of the Census and are provisional estimates of the resident population as of July 1, 1977 (Table 1 and table 5). Estimates of the resident population by age are from Current Population Reports, Series P- 25, no. 721. Population figures from those States where diseases were not notifiable or where age specific data were not available were excluded from rate calculations. The morbidity data in this report represent cases reported to CDC through State health departments. The accuracy of reporting, that is, the number of cases that are reported to CDC as compared with the actual number that occur, varies with the disease. Some diseases, such as plague and rabies, that cause severe clinical illness and are associated with serious consequences are probably reported fairly completely. Diseases that are clinically mild and infrequently associated with serious consequences, such as salmonellosis and mumps, {{are less likely to be}} reported. Additionally, subclinical cases are seldom detected except in the course of special studies. Also, the degree of completeness of reporting is influenced by the diagnostic facilities available, the control measures in effect, and the interests and priorities of State and local officials responsible for disease control and surveillance. The data in this report stem from a variety of reporting mechanisms and motivations that seem to remain consistent; thus the analysis of trends is valid. For example, the age and seasonal distribution of these samples have been shown to be consistent over the years. In order not to delay the publication of this document, we have included provisional data from California. For confirmation of any of those data, contact the California State Department of Health.

40|$|Liquefaction, {{a catastrophic}} failure {{phenomenon}} of saturated or nearly saturated granular materials, {{can be divided}} into either static or cyclic liquefaction depending on whether the loading condition is monotonic or cyclic. Static liquefaction, also referred to as static instability, is in fact undrained deviatoric strain softening behaviour where instability in the context of continuum mechanics, i. e. dσijdε< 0, is manifested (where σij and εij are stress and strain tensors respectively and “d” represent infinitesimal increments). On the other hand, cyclic liquefaction can occur in the form of either cyclic instability or cyclic mobility. Cyclic instability is a deviatoric strain softening behaviour triggered by a series of cyclic stress pulses and followed the same line of argument as for static instability. Cyclic mobility can be categorised as a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> of 5 % double amplitude (DA) axial strain and the effective stress path travel transiently to near zero in a load cycle, but the imposed peak (and trough) deviator stress can still be developed even a few loading cycles after the occurrence of cyclic mobility. Experimental results on Sydney sand with fines (particles passing 0. 075 mm sieve) and coal ash, and different published databases for sands with fines as well as clean sands were used to investigate different aspects of above-mentioned forms of liquefaction giving particular emphasis on cyclic liquefaction. Prior research investigations in linking static and cyclic instability mostly concentrated on clean sand and very limited studies in this regard could be found for sand with fines. In all of those investigations, the linkage between static and cyclic instability was examined by forming replicate test-pairs where a test-pair formed between undrained monotonic and cyclic loading test of one-way or two-way. Also, different characteristics lines have been proposed to define the triggering of cyclic instability. This thesis examines the linkage of static and cyclic instability by forming equivalent as well as replicate test-pairs. The concept of equivalent granular state parameter was proposed to capture the influence of fines content, ∫c. An equivalent test-pair was formed by different combinations of fines contents, ∫c (less than threshold fines contents, ∫thre), initial effective confining stress, p' 0 and void ratio, e 0, but having same equivalent granular state parameter, ψ∗(0) where the symbol “ 0 ” next to parameters is used to indicate prior to shearing. Experimental results showed that, cyclic instability, under one-way and two-way cyclic loading, triggered shortly after the cyclic ESP crossed the ηIS-zone as determined from a corresponding monotonic loading test, where, ηIS is the effective stress ratio (q/p׳) at peak of undrained monotonic ESP. Further, this finding is equally applicable for both equivalent and replicate test-pairs. The next step is to predict the triggering of cyclic instability without having a corresponding (equivalent or replicate) monotonic test. This was achieved via the concept of instability curve which is a single relationship between ηIS and ψ*(0) for a range of fines content less than the threshold value. Two instability curves (IC), namely ICcom and ICext as obtained in ηIS-ψ∗(0) space for Sydeny sand with fines were used for predicting cyclic instability of same soil, where subscript “com” and “ext” indicate the ICs obtained from data points of undrained monotonic compression and extension tests respectively. Test results showed that ICcom and ICext could be successfully used to predict triggering of cyclic instability in the corresponding stress space capturing the influence of ∫c (<∫thre), p' 0 and initial static shear stress, q 0. The lack of a unified framework in predicting different forms of cyclic liquefaction have been revealed in literature. Thus, published databases for three clean sands and four sands with fines were systematically analysed in context of critical state soil mechanics, CSSM to examine whether it is giving an indicative response. Analysed databases suggested that the occurred form of cyclic liquefaction (cyclic instability and cyclic mobility) could be predicted depending on the corresponding value of the state parameter, ψ(0), for clean sand; or ψ∗(0) for sand with fines. In the later case, the influence of ∫c (<∫thre) {{does not have to be}} separately accounted for as its already captured in the definition of ψ*(0). Then, these findings were further verified by conducting experimental investigation for Sydney sand with fines. During the experimental investigation, a new form of cyclic liquefaction was identified along with two others as mentioned above. This newly identified form of cyclic liquefaction was referred to as transition behaviour which manifested some (but not all) of the features of both cyclic instability and cyclic mobility. This study demonstrates that all forms of cyclic liquefaction can be predicted throughψ∗(0) capturing the effect of ∫c (<∫thre), p' 0 and imposed q 0. Therefore, a unified framework for predicting different mode of cyclic liquefaction under CSSM has been achieved. In this thesis, cyclic liquefaction behaviour was also investigated for a coal ash which is predominantly fines. Preliminary experimental results on coal ash also showed three forms of cyclic liquefaction as observed for Sydney sand with fines...|$|E

Phys. 116, 399 (2002) ] is generalized {{to the case of}} equilibrium cyclization, for which the rate constants for the forward and backward reaction are finite. The model is based on the diffusion-reaction formalism of Wilemski and Fixman [J. Chem. Phys. 60, 866 (1974) ], and employs a path integral representation of the semiflexible chain (within a certain Gaussian approximation) to derive an expression for the steady <b>state</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> open configurations for given values of the chain length N, the reaction radius a, the degree of stiffness z, and the ratio of forward to backward reaction rates k/kr. The steady state probability is used to calculate the free energy changes for the open-to-close transition. Chain rigidity is found to strongly influence the standard Gibbs free energy and enthalpy for the transition. While flexible chains tend to cyclize by virtue of their entropic elasticity alone, cyclization in semiflexible chains is also governed by the change in enthalpy between the open and closed states. The results are in qualitative agreement with the experimental measurements of Libchaber and co-workers...|$|R
