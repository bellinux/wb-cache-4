The analysis is used to provide the rotor wake induced velocities at the rotor blades for use in blade airloads and response analyses and to provide induced velocities at arbitrary field points such as at a tail surface. This analysis calculates the distribution of rotor wake induced velocities based on a prescribed wake model. Section operating conditions are prescribed from blade motion and controls determined by a <b>separate</b> <b>blade</b> response analysis. The analysis represents each blade by a segmented lifting line, and the rotor wake by discrete segmented trailing vortex filaments.

In September 2013, Intel announced technology to transmit data at speeds of 100 gigabits per second along a cable approximately five millimeters in diameter for connecting servers inside data centers. Conventional PCI-E data cables carry data at up to eight gigabits per second, while networking cables reach 40 Gb. The latest version of the USB standard tops out at ten Gb. The technology does not directly replace existing cables in that it requires a separate circuit board to interconvert electrical and optical signals.

Another type of design ordering is that blade buckle together with a part of shaft creates bladed disk. It is necessary to look on dynamic behaviour of this rotors not only as whole rotors, but also as individual bladed disks. This contribution deals with an analysis of dynamic behaviour of disks. The main for this analysis is acquaintance frequency-modal phenomenons at quiescent state. For modes excitation analysis in rotation, especially for bladed disks, is necessary to build ”full” model, it means whole disk, not only cyclic sector. Analysis in time domain presents numerical simulations of rotating bladed disks dynamic behaviour. In the mentioned case it ts possible to suppose steady operating state. The response to noted rotation speed change should be analysed too. In this paper is presented theoretic analysis of bladed disks and analysis of real bladed disk...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{satisfy the}} {{requirement}} in blisk machining, a barrel-ball milling (BBM) cutter suitable for machining both blade and hub {{is presented in}} this paper. The selection of cutter parameter and calculation of cutter location were put forward. The new efficient machining cutter location via the advanced optimization on cutter machining strip width was gained. By the numerical simulation of blisk blade machining, the feasibility of the BBM cutter and cutter location strategy were verified. The result showed that the efficiency of this method was increased to {{more than three times}} compared to the machining with a ball cutter. In the manufacturing of turbine parts, a blisk is more difficult to machine compared to <b>separated</b> <b>blades,</b> owing to the limited spacing between neighboring blades. To avoid interference between the cutter and blades, additional constraints have to be brought into the tool path generation and into the cutter size selection.

40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{characteristics of}} tuned and randomly mistuned blade assemblies which possess two blade-alone natural modes with close frequencies are studied. Modal interactions {{among the two}} blade modes are shown to be come extremely significant for small frequency separation. The two distinct loci of the aeroelastic eigenvalues, which characterize an assembly with well separated modes, fully merge into a single root locus as the blade-mode frequency separation vanishes. Also, while {{in the case of}} well <b>separated</b> <b>blade</b> modes the introduction of random mistuning into one blade mode affects only the assembly modes which are predominantly of that blade-mode type, mistuning results in the localization of all the assembly modes when the blade-alone natural frequencies are close. Results indicate {{that in the case of}} closely-spaced blade modes a single-degree of freedom blade model yields qualitatively erroneous results and that an N-blade assembly with two close blade modes behaves like an equivalent 2 Nb-blade assembly with a single blade mode...|$|R
50|$|In some brown algae, {{there is}} a single lamina or blade, while in others there may be many <b>separate</b> <b>blades.</b> Even in those species that {{initially}} produce a single blade, the structure may tear with rough currents or as part of maturation to form additional blades. These blades may be attached directly to the stipe, to a holdfast with no stipe present, or there may be an air bladder between the stipe and blade. The surface of the lamina or blade may be smooth or wrinkled; its tissues may be thin and flexible or thick and leathery. In species like Egregia menziesii, this characteristic may change depending upon the turbulence of the waters in which it grows. In other species, the surface of the blade is coated with slime to discourage the attachment of epiphytes or to deter herbivores. Blades are also often the parts of the alga that bear the reproductive structures.|$|R

The efficient blur reduction capability cf an optimized double shutter imaging technique is demonstrated omitting error-prone post-processing or laborious de-rotation setups. The system is applied on Mach-scaled DSA- 9 A helicopter blades in climb at various collective pitch settings and blade tip Mach- and chord Reynolds numbers (M_tip = 0. 29 - 0. 57; Re_tip = 4. 63 - 9. 26 * 10 " 5). Temperature effects in the PSP are corrected by a theoretical approximation validated against measured temperatures using temperature-sensitive paint (TSP) on a <b>separate</b> <b>blade.</b> Ensemble averaged PSP-results are comparable to pressure-tap data on the same blade to within 250 Pa. Resulting pressure maps on the blade suction side reveal spatially high resolved flow features such as the leading edge suction peak, footprints cf blade-tip vortices and evidence of laminar-turbulent boundary-layer (BL) transition. The findings are validated by a separately conducted BL transition measurement by means of TSP and numerical simulations using a 20 coupled Euler/ boundary-layer code.

40|$|A {{mixed-flow}} impeller {{was designed}} to give a prescribed blade-surface velocity distribution at mean blade height for a given hub-shroud profile. The blade shape at mean blade height, which was produced by the prescribed velocity distribution, was extended by means of radial lines to form the composite blade shape from hub to shroud. The resulting blade was relatively thick; therefore, {{it was necessary to}} retain the inverse blade taper which resulted from extension of the radial lines in order to prevent merging or near merging of the <b>separate</b> <b>blades</b> near the hub. For the first test version of the impeller, designated the MFI- 2 A, the blade height was arbitrarily made greater than that for the basic impeller (the MFI- 2) to allow for viscous effects.

The adiabatic efficiency of the MFI- 2 A is four points lower than that for impeller model MFI- 1 A, but because of the higher slip factor for the MFI- 2 A, the pressure ratios are approximately equal.

30|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the secretion {{mechanism of the}} hyper-secretion signal peptide-lacking β-xylosidase PtXyl 43, a non-classically secreted protein, from the fungus Paecilomyces thermophila in Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3). PtXyl 43 secretion is a two-step process, and the second step is accompanied by cell periplasmic leakage, indicating that PtXyl 43 secretion {{is the result of}} semi-specific secretion. Homology modeling of PtXyl 43 suggested that PtXyl 43 had a canonical GH 43 family β-xylosidase structure containing five blades. Seventeen blade deletions or circular mutants were designed to identify the conformational motif(s) involved in secretion. These mutants were expressed as recombinant, codon-optimized proteins in E. coli. Notably, only mutants containing blades 2 – 4 were effectively secreted. Blades 2 – 4 are necessary for secretion, but it appears that blade 1 or 5 must be present to maintain the structure of blades 2 – 4. Simultaneous deletion of blades 1 and 5 dramatically reduces excretion. The covalent and sequential linking of blades of 2, 3 and 4 are important for the excretion of mutants, as <b>separate</b> <b>blades</b> of 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 abolishes excretion. Fusion with PtXyl 43 promotes the excretion of GFP from the periplasm to the extracellular milieu, which suggested that PtXyl 43 had the potential to carry proteins. This study provides new insights into secretory mechanism of secretable signal peptide-lacking proteins in E. coli. To our knowledge, this is the first to definitively identify the conformational determinants for secretion of a signal peptide-lacking GH 43 family β-xylosidase. This finding also has application potential for the secretion of recombinant proteins.|$|R
