40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to develop and {{validate}} a computational method for the solution of viscous incompressible flow in a domain with specified <b>static</b> <b>or</b> <b>total</b> pressure on the flow-through boundaries (inflow and outflow). The computational algorithm is based on the Finite Volume Method in nonstaggered boundary-fitted grid. The implementations of the boundary conditions on the flow-through parts of the boundary are discussed. Test examples illustrate the main features and validity of the proposed method to study viscous incompressible flow through a bounded domain with specified static pressure (or total pressure) on boundary as a part of well-posed boundary conditions...|$|E

Indicial-and frequency-response tests were conducted with fuel flow as the input variable. For {{a wide range of}} operating points, the response of <b>static</b> <b>or</b> <b>total</b> pressure to fuel flow consisted of a dead time followed by a response form that generally approximated a linear, first-order, lead-lag. The dead time varied significantly only with distance from the combustion zone. The rise ratio and the time constant of the lead-lag function were nearly independent of the pressure sensed...|$|E
40|$|Multi-zone and CFD airflow {{models are}} two {{important}} tools {{for the study}} of indoor environmental quality. The coupling of these two programs can provide a complementary and thus more accurate prediction of airflow in buildings with an acceptable computing cost. This paper reports the process to couple a multi-zone and a CFD program through pressure boundary conditions at room openings. The study developed a new algorithm to handle pressure boundary conditions in CFD. The algorithm allows the specification of a <b>static</b> <b>or</b> <b>total</b> pressure condition for a particular opening in CFD. It can automatically determine whether the pressure should be treated as total pressure (inflow) or static pressure (outflow) based on whether the airflow enters or leaves the space. To achieve a stable solution during the iterative calculation, special numerical relaxation methods have been used in the implementation of pressure boundary conditions. The validation and application studies show that the pressure boundary treatments and the coupling algorithm are sound...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{difference}} between the true discharge coefficient CD for liquid flow through a safety valve and the more familiar "coefficient" KD; this difference increases with the orifice-to-inlet diameter ratio. The use of CD or KD depends on whether the relief system design calculations are carried out in terms of <b>static</b> <b>or</b> <b>total</b> pressures. Confusion between CD and KD could result in undersizing of valves. These matters are discussed in this paper and the relationship between CD and KD is derived. Furthermore, a safety valve model is proposed in which the flow characteristics are described by a discharge coefficient CDn for the valve nozzle and a loss coefficient Kb for the valve body. This two-parameter model permits a more detailed description of the flow than existing models. It is found that, for some valve tipes, it is important to take account of the area change between the inlet and the orifice. The implications of this for sizing and stability are discussed. JRC.

Therefore we attain to the opportunity of a dynamic analysis “step-by-step”, with soil-structure interaction, with nonlinear behaviour and damages for all the involved materials, subjected to various accelerograms applied on the bedrock. In the monument, destructive experimental tests on the walls are not available. The maps of elasticity moduli and damping coefficient are obtained by experimental-numerical comparison of dynamic tests acting on the whole structure.
