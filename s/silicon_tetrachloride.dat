40|$|As part of {{the general}} study of {{icosahedral}} carborane chemistry a comprehensive literature survey is presented with references. Investigations of the preparative routes to ortho-carborane, 1 -methyl-o-carborane and some carborane polymers showed that improvements on existing literature methods could be made. In the synthesis of possible carborane-polymer precursors, several coupled carborane systems were investigated. These included C-C',B-B' direct cage coupling reactions and coupling via short alkyl chains. Reactions of MeƟLi (Ɵ= -CB(_ 10) HC-) with boron chlorides produced the previously unreported boron coupled carboranes (MeƟ) (_ 2) BR, (R=C 1,OH, Ph) and MeƟBPh(_ 2). Three carborane cages could not be bonded to a singleboron atom. The previously unreported di-(3, 3 '-o-carboranyl) -N,N-r 12 -piperazine was prepared from the [HƟH](^ 2 -) anion. Studies were made of the reaction of MeƟLi with ICN and (CN) (_ 2). An attempted ortho-metallation reaction with SnCl(_ 4) MeƟLi and PhCN yielded an interesting dicyclic tin adduct, SnCl(_ 4). [(PhCN) (_ 3) ](_ 2). The reactions of C(_ 2) B(_ 9) H(_ 11) (^ 2 -) with tin, germanium and <b>silicon</b> <b>tetrachlorides</b> produced a new class of dicarboranyl metal "sandwich" compounds for which a novel tilted cage structure was proposed.

2500|$|LiH is {{not usually}} a hydride-reducing agent, except in the {{synthesis}} of hydrides of certain metalloids. For example, silane is produced in the reaction of lithium hydride and <b>silicon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> by the Sundermeyer process: ...|$|E
2500|$|Silicon tetrabromide is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula SiBr4.

2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{industrial process}} for the preparation of very high purity silane, suitable {{for use in the}} production of semiconductor grade silicon, starts with metallurgical grade silicon, hydrogen, and <b>silicon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> and involves a complex series of redistribution reactions (producing byproducts that are recycled in the process) and distillations. The reactions are summarized below: ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{its close}} {{similarity}} to <b>silicon</b> <b>tetrachloride,</b> {{there are few}} applications unique to SiBr4. [...] The pyrolysis of SiBr4 does {{have the advantage of}} depositing silicon at faster rates than that of SiCl4, however SiCl4 is usually preferred due to its availability in high purity. Pyrolysis of SiBr4 followed by treatment with ammonia yields silicon nitride (Si3N4) coatings, a hard compound used for ceramics, sealants, and the production of many cutting tools.|$|E
2500|$|With inside vapor deposition, the preform {{starts as}} a hollow glass tube {{approximately}} [...] long, which is placed horizontally and rotated slowly on a lathe. Gases such as <b>silicon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> (SiCl4) or germanium tetrachloride (GeCl4) are injected with {{oxygen in the}} end of the tube. The gases are then heated by means of an external hydrogen burner, bringing the temperature of the gas up to 1,900K (1,600°C, 3,000°F), where the tetrachlorides react with oxygen to produce silica or germania (germanium dioxide) particles. When the reaction conditions are chosen to allow this reaction to occur in the gas phase throughout the tube volume, in contrast to earlier techniques where the reaction occurred only on the glass surface, this technique is called modified chemical vapor deposition (MCVD).|$|E
2500|$|Silicon and {{silicon carbide}} readily react with all four stable halogens, forming the colourless, {{reactive}} and volatile silicon tetrahalides. Silicon tetrafluoride {{may also be}} made by fluorinating the other silicon halides, and is produced by the attack of hydrofluoric acid on glass. Heating two different tetrahalides together also produce a random mixture of mixed halides, which may also be produced by halogen exchange reactions. The melting and boiling points of these species usually rise with increasing atomic weight, though there are many exceptions: for example, the melting and boiling points drop as one passes from SiFBr3 through SiFClBr2 to SiFCl2Br. The shift from the hypoelectronic elements in group 13 and earlier to the group 14 elements {{is illustrated by the}} change from an infinite ionic structure in aluminium fluoride to a lattice of simple covalent silicon tetrafluoride molecules, as dictated by the lower electronegativity of aluminium than silicon, the stoichiometry (the +4 oxidation state being too high for true ionicity), and the smaller size of the silicon atom compared to the aluminium atom. <b>Silicon</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> is manufactured on a huge scale as a precursor to the production of pure silicon, silicon dioxide, and some silicon esters. The silicon tetrahalides hydrolyse readily in water, unlike the carbon tetrahalides, again because of the larger size of the silicon atom rendering it more open to nucleophilic attack and the ability of the silicon atom to expand its octet which carbon lacks. The reaction of silicon fluoride with excess hydrofluoric acid produces the octahedral hexafluorosilicate anion [...]|$|E
