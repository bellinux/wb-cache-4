The surname Horseman (1226 onwards) {{on the other hand}} is a metonym for a rider, mounted warrior, or horse-dealer, while the <b>surnames</b> Horse and Horsnail could either be nicknames or metonyms for workers with horses and shoers of horses respectively.|$|E

2500|$|In this case, Paz y Miño is in {{fact the}} {{paternal}} <b>surname,</b> being a true compound <b>surname.</b> His children, therefore, would inherit the compound <b>surname</b> [...] "Paz y Miño" [...] as their paternal <b>surname,</b> while Estrella would be lost, since the mother's paternal <b>surname</b> becomes the children's second <b>surname</b> (as their own maternal <b>surname).</b> [...] "Paz" [...] alone would not be passed on, nor would [...] "Miño" [...] alone.|$|R

Professional clubs also usually display players' <b>surnames</b> or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.|$|E
