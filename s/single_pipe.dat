25|$|Older {{stations}} {{tend to use}} {{a separate}} pipe for every kind of available fuel and for every dispenser. Newer stations may employ a <b>single</b> <b>pipe</b> for every dispenser. This pipe houses a number of smaller pipes for the individual fuel types. Fuel tanks, dispenser and nozzles used to fill car tanks employ vapor recovery systems, which prevents releases of vapor into the atmosphere with a system of pipes. The exhausts are placed as high as possible. A vapor recovery system may be employed at the exhaust pipe. This system collects the vapors, liquifies them and releases {{them back into the}} lowest grade fuel tank available.|$|E
25|$|In 1869, at age 22, Westinghouse {{invented a}} {{railroad}} braking system using compressed air. The Westinghouse system used a compressor on the locomotive, a reservoir {{and a special}} valve on each car, and a <b>single</b> <b>pipe</b> running {{the length of the}} train (with flexible connections) which both refilled the reservoirs and controlled the brakes, allowing the engineer to apply and release the brakes simultaneously on all cars. It is a failsafe system, in that any rupture or disconnection in the train pipe will apply the brakes throughout the train. It was patented by Westinghouse on October 28, 1873. The Westinghouse Air Brake Company (WABCO) was subsequently organized to manufacture and sell Westinghouse's invention. It was in time nearly universally adopted by railways. Modern trains use brakes in various forms based on this design. The same conceptual design of fail-safe air brake is also found on heavy trucks.|$|E
500|$|In a {{detailed}} {{study published in}} 1987 of the tiger's musical and noise-making functions, Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume concluded that since coming to Britain, [...] "the instrument has been ruthlessly reworked, {{and in doing so}} much of its original operating principles have been destroyed". There are two ranks of pipes in the organ (as opposed to the wailing and grunting functions), each [...] "comprising eighteen notes, [...] are nominally of 4ft pitch and are unisons - i.e. corresponding pipes in each register make sounds of the same musical pitch. This is an unusual layout for a pipe organ although while selecting the two stops together results in more sound ... there is also detectable a slight beat between the pipes so creating a celeste effect. ... it is considered likely that as so much work has been done ... this characteristic may be more an accident of tuning than an intentional feature". The tiger's grunt is made by a <b>single</b> <b>pipe</b> in the tiger's head and the man's wail by a <b>single</b> <b>pipe</b> emerging at his mouth and connected to separate bellows located in the man's chest, where they can be accessed by unbolting and lifting off the tiger. The grunt operates by cogs gradually raising the weighted [...] "grunt-pipe" [...] until it reaches a point where it slips down [...] "to fall against its fixed lower-board or reservoir, discharging the air to form the grunting sound" [...] Today all the sound-making functions rely on the crank-handle to power them, though Ord-Hume believes this was not originally the case.|$|E

500|$|The {{operation}} of a crank handle powers several different mechanisms inside Tipu's Tiger. A set of bellows expels air through a pipe inside the man's throat, with its opening at his mouth. This produces a wailing sound, simulating the cries of distress of the victim. A mechanical link causes the man's left arm to rise and fall. This action alters the pitch of the 'wail pipe'. Another mechanism inside the tiger's head expels air through a <b>single</b> <b>pipe</b> with two tones. This produces a [...] "regular grunting sound" [...] simulating {{the roar of the}} tiger. Concealed behind a flap in the tiger's flank is the small ivory keyboard of a two-stop pipe organ in the tiger's body, allowing tunes to be played.|$|E
2500|$|Rocket uses a multi-tubular boiler design. Previous {{locomotive}} boilers {{consisted of}} a <b>single</b> <b>pipe</b> surrounded by water (though the Lancashire Witch did have twin flues). Rocket has 25 copper fire-tubes that carry the hot exhaust gas from the firebox, through the wet boiler to the blast pipe and chimney.

Additionally, radiant heating from the enlarged separate firebox helped deliver a further increase in steaming and hence boiler efficiency.|$|E

2500|$|Late in August 1915, Livens left Chatham to join one of {{the newly}} formed Royal Engineer Special Gas Companies where {{he was one of}} very few {{officers}} to have a background in engineering rather than chemistry. At the time, gas warfare was very primitive: heavy cylinders of poison gas were manhandled to the front trenches and their contents simply vented out through metal pipes relying on a breeze to carry the toxic cloud over the enemy trenches. But the wind could be fickle and change in its direction: the first British gas attack at Loos was a disaster.

40|$|This study investigates {{propagation}} buckling of subsea pipe-in-pipe (PIP) systems under hydrostatic pressure. Unlike {{in previous}} studies, PIP systems consisting of carrier pipes with a diameter-to-thickness (D=t) ratio {{in the range}} 26 - 40 are examined here. Experimental results from ring squash tests (RSTs), confined ring squash tests (CRSTs), and hyperbaric chamber tests are presented and compared with a modified two-dimensional (2 D) analytical solution and with numerical results using three-dimensional (3 D) finite-element (FE) analysis. The comparison indicates that the proposed modified analytical expression provides a more accurate lower-bound estimate of the propagation buckling pressure of PIP systems compared with the existing equations, especially for higher D=t ratios. The novel RST and CRST protocols proposed for PIP systems give lower-bound estimates of the propagation pressure. The FE analysis outcomes demonstrate that the lengths of PIP system transition zones are almost twice the corresponding lengths in <b>single</b> <b>pipes.</b> New modes of buckling are discovered in the hyperbaric chamber tests of PIP systems with D=t = 26...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a damped linear hyperbolic system modelling {{the propagation of}} pressure waves in a network of pipes. Well-posedness is established via semi-group theory {{and the existence of}} a unique steady state is proven in the absence of driving forces. Under mild assumptions on the network topology and the model parameters, we show exponential stability and convergence to equilibrium. This generalizes related results for <b>single</b> <b>pipes</b> and multi-dimensional domains to the network context. Our proof of the exponential stability estimate is based on a variational formulation of the problem, some graph theoretic results, and appropriate energy estimates. The main arguments are rather generic and can be applied also for the analysis of Galerkin approximations. Uniform exponential stability can be guaranteed for the resulting semi-discretizations under mild compatibility conditions on the approximation spaces. A particular realization by mixed finite elements is discussed and the theoretical results are illustrated by numerical tests in which also bounds for the decay rate are investigated...|$|R
