50|$|The {{traditional}} livestock-raising peoples are the Bara, Sakalava, {{and other}} groups {{of the south and}} the west, where almost every family owns some zebu cattle. The common practice is to allow the animals to graze almost at will, and the farmers take few precautions against the popular custom of cattle stealing. These farmers are also accustomed to burning off the dry grass to promote the growth of new vegetation for animal feed. The cattle generally are <b>slaughtered</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> ceremonial occasions, but these are so frequent that the per capita meat consumption among the cattle herders is very high.|$|R

The massacre took place near the village of Glencoe (Gaelic: Gleann Comhann) and in various parts of Glencoe at Inverrigan, Invercoe, Carnoch, Auchnaion and Achtriochtan.

40|$|RONO: 00 Narrow {{leaf and}} yellow lupins have {{significant}} potential {{with respect to}} ruminant, poultry and aquaculture supply chains in the UK. Their protein and oil content is such that they have considerable promise as part of livestock diets together with other advantages as arable break crops. However, the current area of these lupins grown in the UK is very small with major problems of low and very variable yields, late maturity and intolerance of alkaline soils. This in turn {{means that there is}} little supply of lupins into feed formulations. We have shown that improvements in these traits is possible, after only two generations of selection, although further germplasm improvement is required before these species can {{play a major role in}} UK agriculture. Similarly, the potential for lupins to replace soya in ruminant diets has been shown in short term studies. There is a need to extend these studies and to focus on the effects of using lupins in ruminant diets over longer time periods and the use of new technologies, such as crimping to allow for earlier harvesting dates, and the use of new technologies, - to enhance palatability and inclusion rates not <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>ruminants</b> but also poultry and fish. At the same time further work on weed control is needed to develop an agronomic 'package' to make the most of narrow leafed and yellow lupins in the UK...|$|R
40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), {{like other}} RNA viruses, {{exhibits}} high mutation rates during replication {{that have been}} suggested to be of adaptive value. However, even though genetic variation in RNA viruses and, more specifically, FMDV has been extensively examined during virus replication {{in a wide variety}} of in vitro cell cultures, very little is known regarding the generation and effects of genetic variability of virus replication in the natural host under experimental conditions and no genetic data are available regarding the effects of serial passage in natural hosts. Here, we present the results of 20 serial contact transmissions of the highly pathogenic, pig-adapted O Taiwan 97 (O Tw 97) isolate of FMDV in swine. We examined the virus genomic consensus sequences for a total of 37 full-length viral genomes recovered from 20 in vivo passages. The characteristics and distributions of changes in the sequences during the series of pig infections were analyzed in comparison to the O Tw 97 genomes recovered from serially infected BHK- 21 cell cultures. Unexpectedly, a significant reduction of virulence upon pig passages was observed, and finally, interruption of the viral transmission chain occurred after the 14 th pig passage (T 14). Virus was, however, isolated from the tonsils and nasal swabs of the asymptomatic T 15 pigs at 26 days postcontact, consistent with a natural establishment of the carrier state previously described <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>ruminants.</b> Surprisingly, the region encoding the capsid protein VP 1 (1 D) did not show amino acid changes during in vivo passages. These data demonstrate that contact transmission of FMDV O Tw 97 in pigs mimics the fitness loss induced by the bottleneck effect, which was previously observed by others during plaque-to-plaque FMDV passage in vitro, suggesting that unknown mechanisms of virulence recovery might be necessary during the evolution and perpetuation of FMDV in nature...|$|R

Occasionally a goat is <b>slaughtered,</b> but <b>only</b> <b>for</b> the chosen few' (Botting [1958]: 203). However, this ethic of renunciation or ascetic ethos was occasionally punctuated in the past as well as today by the ritual slaughter of animals for a number of social functions: the culling of male kids as a herd management strategy and their consumption (today they are sold), weddings and funerals (where some half of the dead person's animals were slaughtered) where all could come and eat and many travelled miles to do so, circumcision ceremonies, slaughter after a woman has given birth, co-operative labour (gīrif) for which the one gaining benefit had to give his co-workers meat, clan gatherings etc. (personal communication with Dr. Miranda Morris).|$|R

40|$|Recently, it {{has become}} {{apparent}} that GIT fermentation is not <b>only</b> of interest <b>for</b> <b>ruminant</b> animals, but also for monogastrics. While it is now widely accepted that the fermentation process and its resultant end-products can have important influences on animal health, {{little is known about}} the microbiological and immunological processes involved. In terms of animal health, most interest at the moment is focussed on those moments in animals' lives when they are faced with sudden changes resulting in stress. The period of weaning in piglets is a typical example of this. The most easily accomplished and appropriate way to influence GIT fermentation processes is that of dietary intervention. This is reflected by the widespread interest in so-called pre- and pro-biotics. Given the complexities of the interactions occurring in the animal itself, it is hardly surprising that in vitro techniques are being widely used: firstly to examine potential substrates for their fermentability and possible inclusion in diets, and secondly, to assess changes in the microbial populations in response to these substrates. This paper will review the techniques currently in use for these two aspects of monogastric fermentation, and provide examples of their use...|$|R

Offal originating from cattle is also an ingredient in certain dishes (see yakiniku).

40|$|In two similar experiments, Lablab purpureus was sown at {{different}} dates in July and August {{to evaluate the}} effects of sowing date on the yield and nutritive value of the plant and shed leaves. On each occasion, an interim harvest was performed on half of the plants sown at each date and the regrowth recorded. The interim harvest reduced the total yield, and in particular that of shed leaves. In {{one of the two}} experiments, late sowing resulted in a considerable reduction in yield, increased crude protein and reduced modified acid-detergent fibre concentrations. Ash concentrations were higher in plants sown later and their shed leaves. Sodium concentrations were inadequate <b>for</b> <b>ruminants</b> and, like phosphorus concentrations, tended to decrease with later sowing.
