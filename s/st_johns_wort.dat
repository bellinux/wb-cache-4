40|$|Interactions between natural health {{products}} (NHP) {{and prescription}} medications are of increasing concern. This paper aims to identify all clinical trials of NHP-drug interactions. To determine the prevalence and outcomes of clinical investigations of NHP-drug pharmacokinetic interactions, electronic databases were searched from inception through March 2004, {{as well as}} reference lists from published reports and {{experts in the field}} for unpublished studies. Eligible studies were clinical investigations of the interaction between a NHP and the metabolism of a regulated medication in humans. Studies were excluded that only investigated the metabolism of an NHP or examined food-drug or NHP-NHP interactions. Two reviewers selected studies for inclusion and independently extracted data. Forty-seven trials were identified, studying an average of 14 participants/study (95 % confidence interval [CI] 11 - 18), examined drug interactions with 19 different herbal preparations. All trials were pharmacokinetic studies, 41 of healthy volunteers and 6 of patients. Ten different herbal medicines as well as 5 different traditional herbal concoctions were studied. Potentially clinically significant drug interactions were observed with <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> <b>wort</b> (16 / 24 studies), garlic (2 / 5 studies), and American ginseng (1 study). Research on NHP-drug interactions is limited in number and scope.

40|$|Hypericum perforatum L. is a plant {{which is}} well known for ages because of its {{medicinal}} properties. <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> <b>Wort</b> was even prescribed by Hippocrates, the father of medicine, Dioscorides the father of pharmacognosy and Pliny. This plant was used as a treatment for puncture wounds, headaches, burns and infections. It is believed that the black - red dots and the translucent perforations on the plant contain the most medicinal properties. The name Hypericum refers {{on the use of the}} plant to wart off evil, by hanging plants over a picture in the house during St. John’s day. The name perforatum refers to the presence of small oil glands in the leaves. Hypericum perforatum L. has long been used as an ancient folk cure for maladies including wounds kidney, lung ailments and depression. The European physicians used the plant for vertigo, burns, paranoia and spontaneous abortion. In ancient time this plant has a history in magic. Also it, was used to protect the live from ailments, protections from death and discover the length of life of family members. The black - red dots on the petals of the plant symbolize the blood shed by <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> at his beheading. In addition the translucent spots on the leaves represent the tears shed because of the event. It has wide range of medical uses because of its chemical composition. St. John’s wort contains procyanidins, antrachinons, carbohydrates, alcohols, triterpenes, sterols, heterosides of phenol carbonic acids and flavonoids, naftodiantronic compounds, phenolic acids, phloroglucinols and essential oils. In the 21 st century, science has offered scientific explanation of St. John’s wort’s features and explained its application, as well as its important role in pharmacy and medicine with its antibacterial, antiviral and antidepressive effects.

50|$|Hyperforin is {{believed}} to be the primary active constituent responsible for the antidepressant and anxiolytic properties of the extracts of <b>St.</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>wort.</b> It acts as a reuptake inhibitor of monoamines, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and of GABA and glutamate, with IC50 values of 0.05-0.10 μg/mL for all compounds, with the exception of glutamate, which is in the 0.5 μg/mL range. Hyperforin also inhibits the reuptake of glycine and choline (IC50=8.5μM). It also modulates acetylcholine release in rat hippocampus and facilitates acetylcholine release in the striatum. It appears to exert these effects by activating the transient receptor potential ion channel TRPC6. Activation of TRPC6 induces the entry of sodium and calcium into the cell which causes inhibition of monoamine reuptake. It also antagonises the NMDA receptor, AMPA receptor and GABA receptors.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to compare the polyphenolic {{composition}} of six medicinal herbs, from wild flora of Romania. The plants investigated, Cynara scolimus (artichoke), Taraxacum officinalis (dandelion), Chelidonium majus (celandine), Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s wort), Silybum marianum (Mary thistle) and Lycopodium clavatum (Wolf’s claw) are known, to have hepatoprotective action. Using in parallel glycerol-water, ethanol-water and methanol, the solvent-dependence of the extract fingerprint and composition in bioactive molecules was studied by UV-Vis and Infrared (FT-MIR) spectrometry. The extraction yields, calculated as an extraction factor (EF) were superior in acidic methanol comparative to glycerin and ethanol, favorising the increase in phenolic acids against flavonoid derivatives. Based on the differences of polarity between the three solvents used, higher EF values were obtained for dandelion, artichoke, celandine and <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> <b>wort,</b> more rich in phenolic acids than flavonoids. Mary thistle and Wolf’s claw had lower concentrations of phenolics, but higher content of lignans and terpenoids. Based on the FT-MIR peaks from 8 regions, for each plant extract, has been determined the fingerprint region between 900 and 1500 cm- 1 and identified the specific functional groups. A good, significant correlation {{was found between the}} concentration of total phenolics calculated by UV-Vis spectrometry and FTIR methods, after calibration with gallic acid. The value of the MIR signal at 1743 cm- 1 may be considered a good indicator of phenolics concentration in such extracts. Combined UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy are recommended as rapid and reliable tools to investigate the fingerprint and to predict the composition of medicinal plants or to evaluate the quality and authenticity of different standardized formulas...|$|R

These include beaver ponds that are shallow or deep, depending on the activity of beavers, sandy depressions and sinkholes that sometimes fill with groundwater, and sinkhole ponds in solid sandstone bedrock. The latter is {{the most common type of}} habitat in the southern portion of its range. Sinkhole ponds usually fill with water in the spring and dry out during the summer, but their hydrology is variable. The bulrush grows at the water's edge, sometimes in a small amount of standing water, but it can be found away from the water or in deeper water up to about a depth of 90 cm. It has been observed experimentally that changes in water level affect the growth of the plant.

40|$|The {{concomitant}} use {{of herbal}} medicines and pharmacotherapy is wide spread. We have reviewed the literature {{to determine the}} possible interactions between seven popular herbal medicines (ginkgo, <b>St</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>wort,</b> ginseng, garlic, echinacea, saw palmetto and kava) and conventional drugs. Literature searches were performed using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and EMBASE and we identified 128 case reports or case series, and 80 clinical trials. Clinical trials indicate that <b>St</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>wort</b> (Hypericum perforatum), via cytochrome P 450 (CYP) andor P-glycoprotein induction, reduces the plasma concentrations (andor increases the clearance) of alprazolam, amitriptyline, atorvastatin, chlorzoxazone, ciclosporin, debrisoquine, digoxin, erythromycin, fexofenadine, gliclazide, imatinib, indinavir, irinotecan, ivabradine, mephenytoin, methadone, midazolam, nifedipine, omeprazole, oral contraceptives, quazepam, simvastatin, tacrolimus, talinolol, verapamil, voriconazole and warfarin. Case reports or case series suggest interactions of <b>St</b> <b>Johns</b> <b>wort</b> with adrenergic vasopressors, anaesthetics, bupropion, buspirone, ciclosporin, eletriptan, loperamide, nefazodone, nevirapine, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, phenprocoumon, prednisone, sertraline, tacrolimus, theophylline, tibolone, tryptophan, venlafaxine and warfarin. Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) decreases the plasma concentrations of omeprazole, ritonavir and tolbutamide. Clinical cases indicate interactions of ginkgo with antiepileptics, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), diuretics, ibuprofen, risperidone, rofecoxib, trazodone and warfarin. Ginseng (Panax ginseng) may interact with phenelzine and warfarin. Kava (Piper methysticum) increases the clearance of chlorzoxazone (a CYP 2 E 1 substrate) and may interact with alprazolam, levodopa and paroxetine. Garlic (Allium sativum) interacts with chlorpropamide, fluindione, ritonavir and warfarin; it also reduces plasma concentrations of chlorzoxazone (a CYP 2 E 1 probe). Echinacea might affect the clearance of caffeine (a CYP 1 A 2 probe) and midazolam (a CYP 3 A 4 probe). No interactions have been reported for saw palmetto (Serenoa repens).
