5|$|Beyoncé's {{music is}} {{generally}} R, {{but she also}} incorporates pop, <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyoncé's exploration of 1990s-style R, as well as further use of <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> hip hop than compared to previous releases. While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyoncé recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyoncé was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.|$|E

5|$|The {{songs on}} Devil's Halo {{featured}} an eclectic fusion of styles, including alternative rock, <b>soul,</b> <b>and</b> jazz-rock.

5|$|Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager {{indicates}} that “Thumbelina” {{was the first}} of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings of one who is different, and, as a result of being different, becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to incorporate the swallow as the symbol of the poetic <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> Andersen’s identification with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble.|$|E
5|$|Chryssides {{states that}} Raëlism is {{discernible}} from other UFO religions for its heavy support for physicalism and repudiation of supernaturalism. Susan J. Palmer, a social scholar {{who had long}} contacts with Raëlians, associated epiphenomenalism with the belief in Raëlism that mind transfer coupled with human cloning can implant mind and personality into a new and disease free body. Raëlians publicly deny {{the existence of the}} ethereal <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> a supernatural god, but they believe that humanity for many generations past will be resurrected, albeit in a scientific way.|$|E

5|$|Designed {{to sound}} like a 1980s record, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. was {{influenced}} by artists such as the Cure, Depeche Mode, Cyndi Lauper and Madonna. The album incorporates a diverse range of genres, including electropop, dance-rock, new wave, R, hip hop, <b>soul,</b> <b>and</b> disco, while lyrically, most of its songs are about fashion and wealth. Promotion of the album included the release of six commercially successful singles and the North American Harajuku Lovers concert tour.

5|$|Expanding on the {{aggressive}} {{sound of the}} band's previous work, Congregation has more refined musical details and slower songs such as ballads. Its music also incorporates R, <b>soul,</b> <b>and</b> funk influences. The album's cover depicts a nude black woman holding a white {{baby in her arms}} and alludes comically to the band's African-American music influences. The songs have themes of pleasure and guilt, and deal with topics such as dysfunctional relationships and sexual deviancy. Conceived during the burgeoning grunge scene, the album has been viewed by music writers as stylistically distinct from other Sub Pop and grunge music.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, GMG radio {{conducted}} {{market research}} into the type of music that listeners in the north-west of England wanted to hear on the radio. The study concluded that many people were dissuaded by the name Jazz, and as a result, 100.4 Jazz FM closed on 13 February 2004 and relaunched as Smooth FM on 1 March. In 2005, GMG rebranded the London station 102.2 Smooth FM. The two renamed stations played {{middle of the road}} music, <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> R during the day and as part of their licence requirements, jazz music at night.|$|E
5|$|Jain texts make a clear {{distinction}} between the Sallekhana and suicide. Its dualistic theology differentiates between <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> matter. Soul is reborn in the Jain belief based on accumulated karma, how one dies contributes to the karma accumulation, and a pious death reduces the negative karmic attachments. The preparation for sallekhana must begin early, much before the approach of death, and when death is imminent, the vow of Sallekhana is observed by progressively slenderising the body and the passions.|$|E
5|$|Maitreyi {{appears in}} ancient Indian texts, {{such as in}} a {{dialogue}} where she explores the Hindu concept of Atman (soul or self) in a dialogue with Yajnavalkya in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.

This Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue is the topic of Sureshvara's varttika, a commentary.|$|E

5|$|Meher Baba's teachings can roughly {{be divided}} into two main categories: his metaphysics {{on the nature of the}} <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> the Universe, and {{practical}} advice for the spiritual aspirant. The two are interrelated. His metaphysics is mostly found in his principal book on the subject, God Speaks. It contains detailed statements on his cosmology and the purpose of life as well as the progression of the soul, while his elucidations on the practical spiritual life are mostly contained in Discourses, although it also covers many metaphysical areas mirroring or amplifying God Speaks.|$|E
5|$|Named {{after the}} nearby city of Winona, {{she was given}} her middle name, Laura, because of her parents' {{friendship}} with Laura Huxley, writer Aldous Huxley's wife.

Ryder's father is an atheist and her mother is a Buddhist; they encouraged their children to take the best part of other religions and use them to make their own belief systems.|$|E

5|$|Neo soul is a {{genre of}} popular music. The term was coined by music {{industry}} entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg {{during the late}} 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> contemporary R. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, and hip hop to pop, fusion, and African music. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.|$|E
5|$|Other Japanese {{role-playing}} games would incorporate random dungeon generation as part {{of their}} design, mimicking part of the nature of roguelikes, and were considered roguelike titles when published in Western markets.

The massively multiplayer online role playing game Final Fantasy XIV added a randomly-generated Deep Dungeon that was inspired by the procedural generation of roguelikes.|$|E

In the process of recording the album, Charles {{became one of the first}} African-American musicians to exercise complete artistic control over his own recording career. The album has been called one of the greatest albums of all time by publications such as Rolling Stone and Time.|$|E
