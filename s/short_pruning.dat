[...] The vine requires a rich soil and <b>short</b> <b>pruning.</b> James Busby brought some Pedro Ximénez to Australia in 1832.

5000|$|In 1954, Marcilla {{defined the}} Airén variety {{as a typical}} vine in the La Mancha region, grown almost {{exclusively}} in that area. He {{described it as a}} [...] Trailing vine, very fertile including the first buds of the shoots, thus allowing very <b>short</b> <b>pruning.</b> Large bunches, quite tightly clustered. [...] Of the wine made from these grapes he states: Gives must from which excellent table wines can be made, and also fine, white wines with a distinctive taste, although this is not very common practice in La Mancha. The average alcohol content of these wines is about 12-14°, and in good years up to 15°. He also mentions Lairén as being grown in Montilla (Córdoba) and in Extremadura.|$|E
50|$|The grapes have a cotton-like bud burst, {{which is}} bronze or {{yellowish}} in colour, with light reddish edge, {{and not very}} intense at the tip. The grapes have a trailing growing habit. The leaves of the Airén are average in size and have a pentagonal shape. The lower lateral sinuses are less marked than the upper ones and the upper face of the leaf is yellowish green in color while the lower face is velvety. The grape bunch is large in size and has an average compactness. It can grow in two different shapes: cylindrical or as a long cone. The grapes are large and spherical and have a yellowish color. The grapes are late to bud burst and also late to ripen. They yield about 4.5 to 6 kg per vine. Further, this grape is very resistant to drought and the base buds are fertile and thus resists very <b>short</b> <b>pruning</b> and still have acceptable yields.|$|E
50|$|Some {{proponents of}} {{permaculture}} advocate no, or limited, pruning. One advocate {{of this approach}} is Sepp Holzer who used the method in connection with Hügelkultur berms. He has successfully grown several varieties of fruiting trees at altitudes (approximately 9000 ft) far above their normal altitude, temperature, and snow load ranges. He notes that the Hügelkultur berms kept and/or generated enough heat to allow the roots to survive during alpine winter conditions. The point of having unpruned branches, he notes, was that the longer (more naturally formed) branches bend over under the snow load until they touched the ground, thus forming a natural arch against snow loads that would break a <b>shorter,</b> <b>pruned,</b> branch.|$|R

40|$|Cytokinins play an {{important}} role in budburst, flowering and fruit set in table grapes. Rest-breaking treatments with hydrogen cyanamide and pruning practices modify budburst and reproductive development in table grapes, especially in regions with low and often inadequate winter chilling. The effect of these treatments on the xylem sap and bud Zeatin riboside (ZR) content was determined during late winter and budburst in 'Sultanina', 'Sunred Seedless', and 'Alphonse Lavalleé' canes in a total of nine trials conducted between 1997 and 2001. Bud ZR levels of hydrogen cyanamide treated 'Sultanina' canes showed an earlier and increased cytokinin peak, in particular in the distal buds. Large ZR peaks before budburst and noticeable differences between distal and proximal buds were absent on non-sprayed canes. The xylary ZR content of long pruned 'Sultanina', 'Sunred Seedless', and 'Alphonse Lavaleé' canes showed a significantly higher and earlier cytokinin peak than in <b>short</b> <b>pruned</b> spurs. By contrast, the bud ZR content tended to be higher in spurs than canes. Pruning and rest-breaking treatments enhanced budburst and increased endogenous cytokinins in these experiments. Long pruning in 'Sultanina' and 'Sunred Seedless' (both parthenocarpic) is necessary for acceptable fruit set and yields. Possibly, in longer canes more cytokinin is available for reproductive development. 'Alphonse Lavaleé' (seeded) is sufficiently fruitful and produces adequate yields following spur pruning. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Articl...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the content of}} reserves in the branches and assessed the vegetative vigor and yield of Niagara Branca, Niagara Rosada and Concord grapevines submitted to two harvests per vegetative cycle. The plants were subjected to a winter pruning (WP) performed {{by means of a}} <b>short</b> <b>pruning,</b> and to a green pruning (GP) at the end of spring performed by pruning branches from the fourth bud above the last grape cluster. The treatments included Control 1 (WP on 07 - 20 - 07 /no GP), Control 2 (WP on 0 - 22 - 07 /no GP), T 1 (WP on 07 - 20 - 07 /GP on 11 - 15 - 07), T 2 (WP on 07 - 20 - 07 /GP on 12 - 17 - 07), T 3 (WP on 08 - 22 - 07 /GP on 11 - 15 - 07) and T 4 (WP on 08 - 22 - 07 /GP on 12 - 17 - 07). The variables evaluated included grapevine production for the two crops, the leaf area index (LAI) throughout the vegetative cycle, and the content of reserves in the branches in the following stages: 2007 WP, first crop flowering, GP on 11 - 15 - 07, GP on 12 - 17 - 07, post-harvest of first and second crop, and 2008 WP. The WP associated to GP allowed to obtain two harvests in all cultivars being more effective in the T 3. The shoots emitted by GP caused changes in the LAI and affected the dynamic of synthesis/ consumption of reserves in the branches of the grapevines. In plants with GP, there was reduction in the content of reserves {{at the end of the}} crop cycle compared to control plants. The pruning management to obtain two annual crops increased the annual production, but reduced the level of reserves of the grapevines. ...|$|E

Don established on a cleared indigenous forest site, mortality {{during the first}} 6 years after planting was higher among cuttings from 7 -year-old trees (37 %) than among seedlings (22 %). There were more deaths associated with Armillaria root rot among cuttings (23 %) than seedlings (13. 5 %) over the same period. No significant difference in height growth was evident between the two types. Although cuttings were smaller in diameter at breast height (a difference of 1. 8 cm at plantation age 6 years and 2. 6 cm at 15 years), annual diameter increments during the period 12 - 15 years after planting were not significantly different. Cuttings had fewer culls as they had less malformation and a more uniform size. Although cuttings had fewer branches in the low pruning zone, seedlings had fewer branches in the high pruning zone, and the pruned butt log over-all (0 - 6 m) contained {{an equal number of}} branches and branch whorls for both seedlings and cuttings. Seedlings had a significantly larger mean branch basal area. Seedlings took longer to prune (10. 2 min/tree) than cuttings (7. 7 min/tree) and in all three pruning lifts had larger diameters over stubs (17, 21, and 24 cm) than cuttings (15, 18, and 21 cm) because of their larger diameters at breast height. Rooted cuttings appear to have some silvicultural advantages over seedlings, such as lower stockings required at planting because of less malformation, smaller branch size, <b>shorter</b> <b>pruning</b> times, and greater uniformity of size...|$|R

This recursive method is continually called on nodes of the tree given a key which gets progressively <b>shorter</b> by <b>pruning</b> characters off {{the front of the}} key.

Whether a new node is created or not, the method checks to see if the first character in the string is greater than or less than the character value in the node and makes a recursive call on the appropriate node as in the lookup operation. If, however, the key's first character is equal to the node's value then the insertion procedure is called on the equal kid and the key's first character is pruned away. [...] Like binary search trees and other data structures, ternary search trees can become degenerate depending on the order of the keys.

It seems to depend upon how well they respond to different challenges and demands of the modern viticulture, such as their adaptability to climate change and vineyard mechanization. This research aims to characterize vine performance and suitability to mechanical harvesting of cultivar ‘Ervi’ (V. vinifera L.), an Italian crossbreed between ‘Barbera’ and ‘Croatina’. The trial was performed between 2008 and 2010 on the Piacenza hills using Guyot trained vines. Cluster number and yield per vine were recorded at harvest. Subsequently, shoot fertility, cluster and berry weight were calculated accordingly. Soluble solids, pH and must titratable acidity were analyzed as well as total anthocyanins and phenols grape content. A pool of 891 berries was randomly picked and their respective detachment force was measured by a dynamometer. ‘Ervi’ showed more constant yield than its parents and shoot fertility higher than ‘Croatina’ suggesting that <b>short</b> spur <b>pruning</b> is feasible. Berry weight in ‘Ervi’ was also lower than in ‘Barbera’. Ripening was earlier than both parents. The adaptability of ‘Ervi’ to the mechanical harvesting is similar to ‘Barbera’ and better than ‘Croatina’. The BDF is cultivar-dependent and is an important parameter for mechanical harvesting.

40|$|Abstract Background Continuing {{research}} into the global multiple sequence alignment problem has resulted in more sophisticated and principled alignment methods. Unfortunately these new algorithms often require large amounts of time and memory to run, making it nearly impossible to run these algorithms on large datasets. As a solution, we present two general methods, Crumble and Prune, for breaking a phylogenetic alignment problem into smaller, more tractable sub-problems. We call Crumble and Prune meta-alignment methods because they use existing alignment algorithms {{and can be used}} with many current alignment programs. Crumble breaks long alignment problems into <b>shorter</b> sub-problems. <b>Prune</b> divides the phylogenetic tree into a collection of smaller trees {{to reduce the number of}} sequences in each alignment problem. These methods are orthogonal: they can be applied together to provide better scaling in terms of sequence length and in sequence depth. Both methods partition the problem such that many of the sub-problems can be solved independently. The results are then combined to form a solution to the full alignment problem. Results Crumble and Prune each provide a significant performance improvement with little loss of accuracy. In some cases, a gain in accuracy was observed. Crumble and Prune were tested on real and simulated data. Furthermore, we have implemented a system called Job-tree that allows hierarchical sub-problems to be solved in parallel on a compute cluster, significantly shortening the run-time. Conclusions These methods enabled us to solve gigabase alignment problems. These methods could enable a new generation of biologically realistic alignment algorithms to be applied to real world, large scale alignment problems. </p...|$|R

40|$|Finding {{prevalent}} patterns in {{large amount of}} data {{has been one of}} the major problems in the area of data mining. Particularly, the problem of finding frequent itemset or sequential patterns in very large databases has been studied extensively over the years, and a variety of algorithms have been developed for each problem. The key feature in most of these algorithms is that they use a constant support constraint to control the inherently exponential complexity of these two problems. In general, patterns that contain only a few items will tend to be interesting if they have a high support, whereas long patterns can still be interesting even if their support is relatively small. Ideally, we want to find all the frequent patterns whose support decreases as a function of their length without having to find many uninteresting infrequent short patterns. Developing such algorithms is particularly challenging because the downward closure property of the constant support constraint cannot be used to <b>prune</b> <b>short</b> infrequent patterns. In this paper we present two algorithms, LPMiner and SLPMiner. Given a length-decreasing support constraint, LPMiner finds all the frequent itemset patterns from an itemset database, and SLPMiner finds all the frequent sequential patterns from a sequential database. Each of these two algorithms combines a well-studied efficient algorithm for constant-support-based pattern discovery with three effective database pruning methods that dramatically reduce the runtime. Our experimental evaluations show that both LPMiner and SLPMiner, by effectively exploiting the lengthdecreasin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} several Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) with profits, which seek {{to select}} a subset of customers, each one being associated with a profit, and to design service itineraries. When the sum of profits is maximized under distance constraints, the problem is usually called team orienteering problem. The capacitated profitable tour problem seeks to maximize profits minus travel costs under capacity constraints. Finally, in the VRP with private fleet and common carrier, some customers can be delegated to an external carrier subject to a cost. Three families of combined decisions must be taken: customers selection, assignment to vehicles, and sequencing of deliveries for each route. We propose a new neighborhood search for these problems, which explores an expo-nential number of solutions in pseudo-polynomial time. The search is conducted on “ex-haustive ” solutions visiting all customers, while an efficient “Select ” algorithm, based on resource-constrained shortest paths, is repeatedly used to select customers and to evaluate routes. Speed-up techniques are introduced to solve more efficiently the <b>shortest</b> paths and <b>prune</b> unpromising moves. The remarkable performance of these neighborhood structures is demonstrated by extensive computational experiments with a local search, an iter-ated local search and a hybrid genetic algorithm. Intriguingly, even a local-improvement method to the first local optimum of this neighborhood achieves an average gap of 0. 09 % on classic team orienteering problem instances, rivaling with the current state-of-the-art metaheuristics. For all three problems, the proposed methodology leads to solutions of higher quality than previous algorithms in similar CPU time. Promising research avenues on hybridizations with standard routing neighborhoods are also open...|$|R
40|$|An {{hypothesis}} that root restriction bags affect the vegetative growth, fruitfulness and fruit maturity of minimally managed field grown grapevines (Vilis vinifera cv. Cabemet Sauvignon) was examined with {{data collected from}} 1991 - 1996 {{as part of an}} ongoing trial. Root restriction clearly reduced vegetative growth, however fruitfulness was less affected, resulting in improvements in crop load and the maturity of the grape berries. The proportionate bag volume effects on growth were less consistent. Grapevine cuttings were planted at ground level in porous geotextile Duon® root control bags in the spring of 1989 in Canterbury, New Zealand. Treatments consisted of four bag volumes of 10, 25, 48 and 102 litres, 'bagged' and unrestricted 'control' vines. The grapevines were spaced at 2 metre between vines and trained to a single cordon. The vines were minimally managed with winter <b>short</b> spur <b>pruning</b> and irrigation was applied uniformly across all treatments. The experiment was divided into three sections to test two hypotheses. Firstly were the bagged vines different from the non bagged vines and secondly were the bag effects proportionate. Root restriction treatments generally reduced all vegetative growth parameters including: pruning fresh weights; trunk cross sectional area; primary and lateral shoot number and length, node number (leaf number), internode length and leaf area per plant. Mean leaf size was smaller and despite the growth reductions the canopy density was improved in the bagged vines, through less leaf shading. Root restriction affected fruitfulness to a lesser extent, leading to increased harvest efficiency indices; fruit weight per unit pruning weight, leaf area per unit pruning weight and the fruit weight produced per total shoot number. Moreover, root restriction treatments affected the main fruit maturity parameters used for wine production. At harvest root restriction treatments increased the juice total soluble solids concentrations and decreased the titratable acidity concentration leading to an increased total soluble solids to titratable acidity ratio. In the final year these differences occurred from 7 weeks prior to harvest. Root restriction treatments also decreased juice potassium ion concentration. Potassium ion concentration was correlated with pH, and pH was generally lower in the bagged vines. Berry colour development at veraison was also earlier in the root restriction treatments. The {{hypothesis that}} bag volumes are proportionate to changes in vegetative growth, fruitfulness and fruit maturity is not clear. There was some evidence to suggest relationships between these parameters may exist, however, R 2 values were low. Clearly the smallest bag volumes had disproportionate growth suggesting root escapes and, or, changed root to shoot relationships which would confound results. Root escapes were confirmed by preliminary root excavation...|$|R

A major limitation to {{the expansion}} of the pear culture cultivated under mild winter, as South of Brazil, is the cultivar adaptation. During the winter, the temperature fluctuation and low accumulation of cold have been reported by some authors as cause of floral button abortion. Moreover, the pear fruit satisfactorily when well managed, being the pruning and girdling one of the main fruiting techniques. This work aimed to evaluate the responses by pear cultivars to different cultural practices in order to increase the fruit an production and to evaluate the development of xylem vessels during dormancy. The work was carried out in two stages: the first in Brazil at the Federal University of Pelotas and the second in Italy, Faculty of Agriculture, in Pisa. In Garber cultivar, the treatments were: 1 - control 2 - <b>short</b> summer <b>pruning</b> 3 - arching of branches and long summer pruning and 4 arching of branches in the winter, 5 - winter pruning; 6 girdling of branches, 7 Promalin ?? and 8 - Biozyme * TF. For the cultivars Shinseiki and Housui, the treatments were: 1 - control, 2 - trunk girdling in April 3 - ringing branches in April. To Kousui, the treatments were: 1 trunk girdling, 2 - branch girdling + pruning 3 - pruning, 4 - branch girdling 5 -control. For the Conference, the healthy and intact branches of plants were marked and followed during the dormancy period, the continuity of vascular bundles between the branches and the buds were observed in the stereomicroscope and the histological evaluations were observed under a fluorescence microscope. All cultivars responded to the blinding technique. For the Garber the effective fruit is influenced by the treatments when assessed in different fruiting bodies. The fruiting body which showed the highest rates of fruit were brindila coronada and bourse. For the Shinseiki cv, the trunk girdling increased the effective fruiting and the production per trunk area. In the cultivar Housui, the branches girdling increased the fruiting but not the production. In the cultivar Kousui the treatments with blinding increased the effective fruiting, the maturation was anticipated and increased the soluble solid content. In the cultivar Conference, through the vascular connections, it can establish stages of dormancy during the bud flowers evolution, as well as to establish that 1, 000 chilling hours are needed to overcome endodormancy...|$|R
