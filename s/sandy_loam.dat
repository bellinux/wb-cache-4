5|$|The {{northern}} part of the commune is hilly but relatively favorable to agriculture, while the southern part is flat and characterized by sand dunes. Sixteen caves are found within the area. The earth is mainly composed of stony rocks, <b>sandy</b> <b>loam</b> soils, and clay loam soils in the beds of wadis in the area. The soils in the hills have pockets of alluvium and <b>sandy</b> <b>loam</b> suitable for crop development, particularly on the hillsides and {{at the foot of the}} hills. Clay loam soils are found in the bowls and beds of wadis, which although suitable for farming are susceptible to gully and water erosion during the rainy season.|$|E
5|$|The soil is of marl, clay, and <b>sandy</b> <b>loam,</b> {{with the}} subsoil being gravel and sand. The {{prominent}} crops are wheat, barley, and oats, {{and a smaller}} number of hops. According to the 2011 census, Steep had a population of 849 people.|$|E
25|$|Soils are acidic, nutrient-poor <b>sandy</b> <b>loam.</b>|$|E

50|$|Like in nature, Senecio haworthii needs well-drained <b>sandy</b> <b>loams,</b> rare {{water and}} full sun.|$|R
50|$|Sagittaria fasciculata {{is found}} in seepage areas with little to no flow. It prefers shaded areas on <b>sandy</b> <b>loams.</b>|$|R
25|$|The soil {{generally}} is a <b>sandy</b> <b>loam</b> or a strong but friable clay, and very fertile. Large quantities of seaweed {{as well as}} lime and marl are available for manure.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} main types of {{soil in the}} {{watershed}} of Little Nescopeck Creek. Two of them are the Arnot Series and the Alluvial land. The Arnot Series soil is shallow and drained well. It ranges between close to flat and steep. The Alluvial land ranges between close to flat and moderately sloping. It contains gravel and stones and is found along flood plains within the watershed. A large number {{of other types of}} soils are found in very small amounts in the creek's watershed. One type of soil that is also found in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed is the Basher Series. Along the creek near Sybertsville, this type of soil is reddish-brown and sticky to a depth of six there inches (15 centimeters). From 6 to 18 inches (15 to 45 centimeters), the soil is reddish-brown with some areas of yellowish-red. From 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 centimeters), the soil is reddish-brown with pinkish-gray areas and is a <b>sandy</b> <b>loam.</b> From 24 to 37 inches (60 to 93 centimeters), the soil is reddish-brown with pinkish-gray areas and is a <b>sandy</b> <b>loam.</b> From 37 to 47 inches (93 to 118 centimeters), the soil is reddish-brown with light gray and yellowish-red areas, and is a coarse <b>sandy</b> <b>loam.</b> From 47 to 53 inches (118 to 133 centimeters), the soil is a reddish-gray <b>sandy</b> <b>loam</b> with some yellowish-red areas. From 53 to 62 inches (133 to 156 centimeters), the soil is reddish-gray and contains sand and gravel.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the soils}} in Modesto are {{classified}} {{as part of the}} Hanford series: (HbpA) fine <b>sandy</b> <b>loam,</b> moderately deep over silt. These soils are well-drained, moderately coarse-textured soils derived from alluvium from granitic rock. The Hanford soils are important for the production {{of a wide variety of}} irrigated orchard, field, and truck crops.|$|E
50|$|Albany is a sub{{region of}} the Great Southern region of Western Australia. Albany’s climate is maritime, {{strongly}} shaped and moderated by the Southern Ocean; the standard description {{is that it}} is Mediterranean, with moist, cool winters and warm, dry summers. Diurnal temperature range is minimal, and moderate humidity in summer assists ripening by reducing stress on the vines. Soil types of the region are either lateritic gravelly, <b>sandy</b> <b>loams</b> or <b>sandy</b> <b>loams</b> derived directly from granite and gneissic rocks.|$|R
50|$|The bedrock under Uplands is {{quartz diorite}} gneiss. Soils are well drained <b>sandy</b> <b>loams</b> of the Cadboro and Langford series (Cd-L or Lsl), or poorly drained <b>sandy</b> clay <b>loams</b> of the Tolmie series (Tscl); all have thick dark topsoils. In {{near-shore}} areas the soils are more stony and are mapped as Langford-Rough Stony complex(L-Rs).|$|R
50|$|Soils {{are mostly}} clay or <b>sandy</b> clay <b>loams</b> which are well drained or {{moderately}} well drained. Some fine <b>sandy</b> <b>loams</b> underlie {{the eastern part}} of town. These have near neutral pH. Other parts of town have moderately alkaline, somewhat saline soils. Around the southern edge of town is an area of strong salinity which imposes limitations on farmers and gardeners.|$|R
25|$|The {{mountains}} are {{a continuation of}} the midland region, gradually ascending to the main ridge of the Western Ghats. Soil in the western slopes is a ferruginous red, <b>sandy</b> <b>loam.</b> Vegetation over the whole area is of the forest type. Irregular distribution of teak, localised areas of bamboo dominance, change of good quality forest into open grass lands, etc. are characteristic.|$|E
25|$|The type of soils that {{dominate}} the upland areas are Tagaytay loam and Tagaytay <b>sandy</b> <b>loam</b> with mountain soil undifferentiated found on the south-eastern side bordering Laguna province. Also on the southern tip are Magallanes clay and Mountain soil undifferentiated with interlacing of Magallanes clay loam steep phase. The Tagaytay loam contains fine sandy materials, moderately friable, and easy to work on when moist. In an undisturbed condition, it bakes and becomes hard when dry. About one-half of this soil type is devoted to upland rice and upland crops. On the other hand, Tagaytay <b>sandy</b> <b>loam</b> is friable and granular with considerable amount of volcanic sand and underlain by adobe clay. Mountain soil undifferentiated is forested with bamboos found in the sea coast. Cavite also has the Patungan sand characterized by pale gray to almost white sand with substratum of marine conglomerates which are found at Sta. Mercedes in Maragondon and in some coastlines of Ternate.|$|E
25|$|To {{the east}} of the city are the Bellarine Hills and the undulating plains of the Bellarine Peninsula. To the west are the sandstone-derived Barrabool Hills and basalt Mount Duneed, and the {{volcanic}} plains to the north of Geelong extend to the Brisbane Ranges and the You Yangs. Soils vary from <b>sandy</b> <b>loam,</b> basalt plains, and river loam to rich volcanic soils, suitable for intensive farming, grazing, forestry, and viticulture.|$|E

50|$|Hydrogels show {{promise for}} use in agriculture, as they can release agrochemicals {{including}} pesticides and phosphate fertiliser slowly, increasing efficacy and reducing runoff, {{and at the same}} time improve the water retention of drier soils such as <b>sandy</b> <b>loams.</b>|$|R
30|$|Average {{summer and}} winter {{temperatures}} at the SDFEC are 26 ° C and 9 ° C, respectively. Annual precipitation is 148 cm. Soils are deep and well-drained <b>sandy</b> <b>loams</b> that are strongly to very strongly acidic with low organic matter.|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the oldest}} vines in the Hunter Valley were planted in 1924 around the village of Fordwich. The Broke Fordwich subregion is between the Upper Hunter Valley to the {{northwest}} and the lower Hunter Valley (including Pokolbin) to the east. Broke Fordwich is sheltered {{on the south side}} of the valley on the Fordwich Sill volcanic red clay and nearby free-draining alluvial soils and <b>sandy</b> <b>loam.</b> It has lower rainfall and higher diurnal temperature variation than Pokolbin.|$|E
25|$|As is expected, {{the soils}} around Cleve are heavily {{tied to the}} geology of the area, with Cleve having a clay overlain by <b>sandy</b> <b>loam</b> soils in the hills and on most slopes in the area. This soil is often {{referred}} to as 'Cleve soil' or 'Nobby's Hill's soil'. The soils are highly productive when they are deep enough to hold enough moisture, but are particularly susceptible to erosion, especially in steeper inclines. There is also a strong calcareous component to much of the areas soils, especially away from the slopes.|$|E
25|$|Despite hot {{summers and}} {{freezing}} winters with frequent frost presenting a constant challenge to vineyard managers and winemakers, {{the area is}} a successful wine growing region thanks to mountains that encircle three sides of the valley, the cloud cover, and afternoon easterly sea breezes which, during summer, help to mitigate the blazing sunshine and keep humidity moderated on the valley floor. Soil types vary from rich red volcanic soil from the long-extinct volcano of Mount View and <b>sandy</b> <b>loam</b> which benefits most white varieties. The red volcanic soil is found mostly on the southern ridges. However, {{it can be found}} in patches on the valley floor.|$|E
50|$|Frankland River {{is one of}} {{the five}} subregions of the Great Southern in Western Australia. It is {{situated}} in the northwestern corner of the region, its western boundary touching the eastern side of Manjimup. It is the most northerly, inland subregion of Great Southern, still Mediterranean in terms of dominant winter-spring rainfall, but with greater continentality. The soils are chiefly derived from lateric gravelly <b>sandy</b> <b>loams</b> or <b>sandy</b> <b>loams</b> derived from granite or gneissic rocks, and so are typically rich, red in color and of uniform depth with some areas carrying marri and karri loams. The climatic influences for the area favor medium-bodied, Bordeaux style red varieties, and with the excellent adaptation of slightly earlier-maturing Shiraz.|$|R
50|$|It has {{a fairly}} wide distribution, {{occurring}} throughout arid and semi-arid areas of Western Australia and South Australia. It is {{commonly found in}} the Great Victoria Desert ecosystem. The relief is generally gentle slopes. It grows in red sands and <b>sandy</b> <b>loams.</b>|$|R
5|$|Favoured {{soils are}} deep grey <b>sandy</b> <b>loams</b> or {{shallower}} sand overlying claypan. Associated vegetation is typically scrubland or shrubland, although moisture-loving trees such as B.littoralis (Swamp Banksia) or Melaleuca preissiana (Moonah) {{may also be}} present, sometimes in sufficient numbers to form a low open woodland.|$|R
25|$|The {{central area}} principally {{consists}} of Magallanes loam with streaks of Magallanes clay loam of sandy texture. This {{is recommended for}} diversified farming such as the cultivation of upland rice, corn, sugarcane, vegetables, coconut, coffee, mangoes and other fruit trees. The steep phase should be forested or planted to rootcrops. The eastern side of Cavite consists of Carmona clay loam with streaks of Carmona clay loam steep phase and Carmona sandy clay loam. This type of soil is granular with tuffaceaous material and concretions. It is hard and compact when dry, sticky and plastic when wet. This type of soil is planted to rice with irrigation or sugarcane without irrigation. Fruit trees such as mango, avocado and citrus are also grown {{in this type of}} soil. Guingua fine <b>sandy</b> <b>loam</b> is found along the lower part of Malabon and Alang-ilang River at Noveleta.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all crops}} and plants, Christmas trees require a {{specific}} set of nutrients to thrive. There are 16elements crucial for growth; of those, three are obtained through air and water: hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, copper, chlorine, manganese, molybdenum, iron, and zinc are obtained from the soil. If the necessary elements are not available in the local soil, nutritious fertilizers are used. Other important soil considerations include pH and drainage. Certain types of soil are preferable, {{depending on the type of}} tree. Pine trees are usually better adapted to a sandy or <b>sandy</b> <b>loam</b> soil, while white spruce trees and fir trees, such as the Douglas-fir, prefer fine-texture loams and clay loam soils. Some trees grow well in all types of soil, but in any case, the land must be well-drained for a Christmas tree farm to have a chance of thriving.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{periodic}} inundation of Southern California by the ocean, most of the Aliso Creek watershed is underlain by several layers of marine sedimentary strata, the oldest dating from the Eocene (55.8–33.9MYA) and the most recent, the Pliocene (5.33–2.59MYA). These alluvial sediments range from [...] in depth. Generally throughout the watershed, there are five major soil and rock outcrop types—Capistrano <b>sandy</b> <b>loam,</b> Cieneba <b>sandy</b> <b>loam,</b> Marina loamy sand, Myford <b>sandy</b> <b>loam,</b> and Cieneba-rock outcrop. The water table ranges from [...] deep.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of fish and other {{wildlife}} are known to occupy the region.

5000|$|The hilltops of the Great Dividing Range are basalt {{from north}} of Uralla to Glen Innes, {{and the eastern}} slopes are the lighter [...] "trap" [...] soils. On the western slopes near Bendemeer, Bundarra, Kentucky and Tenterfield the country is granite, with {{extensive}} <b>sandy</b> <b>loams.</b>|$|R
25|$|This ash {{has since}} {{developed}} a soil type called andisol. Soils in Crater Lake National Park are brown, dark brown or dark grayish-brown <b>sandy</b> <b>loams</b> or loamy sands which have plentiful cobbles, gravel and stones. They are slightly to moderately acidic and their drainage is somewhat excessive.|$|R
500|$|The Barbour series occurs {{near the}} source of the creek. It is topped with a crumbly, [...] layer of brownish-red silt loam over a loose subsoil of reddish-brown loam with some gravel. The top layer can easily be {{penetrated}} by roots and water. Further down is a layer of reddish-brown gravel and sand, which extends to [...] or more underground. The Basher series also occurs along upper Fishing Creek. The top layer is a loose, crumbly, reddish-brown <b>sandy</b> <b>loam</b> extending to [...] underground, and the subsoil is a loose, porous, reddish-brown <b>sandy</b> <b>loam</b> with some gravel, extending to [...] underground. Lower down, there is a layer of red <b>sandy</b> <b>loam</b> with some gravel that extends from [...] underground.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of European American {{settlers}} and explorers, the Allegheny Mountain Range of the Appalachian Mountains was overlaid with old-growth forests consisting predominantly of deciduous hardwood trees, which were characterized by individual trees of enormous size and girth. The American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) was one of the species of trees that proliferated throughout these old-growth forests. American sycamores can grow at least [...] in height and the species is distributed throughout the Eastern United States. It usually thrives in moist soils along streams, especially in <b>sandy</b> <b>loam</b> soils. American sycamores are a dominant species in bottomland and riparian forests. The species is present throughout every county in West Virginia, and is most abundant along the state's streams.|$|E
500|$|Several streams {{serve as}} {{distributaries}} and tributaries of Cibolo Creek, and {{are included in}} the watershed. Balcones Creek, a [...] long stream that rises in Bandera County and acts as the boundary between Bexar and Kendall Counties, is a main tributary of Cibolo Creek that converges at the meeting of Bexar, Kendall and Bandera Counties. Tributaries in the lower watershed include Martinez Creek, a [...] long stream with a Mesquite tree-supporting bed of clay and <b>sandy</b> <b>loam,</b> located near Windcrest in eastern Bexar County; and Santa Clara Creek, [...] long and Elm Creek, [...] long, both streams in Guadalupe County near New Berlin that supports conifers along their shores. Additional tributaries include Alum Creek, and Elm Creek.|$|E
25|$|Soils in Columbia {{are well}} drained in most cases, with grayish brown loamy sand topsoil.
