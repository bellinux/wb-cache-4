5|$|For the Europe/Africa Zone Group I tie against Serbia and Montenegro, Murray {{had been}} {{suffering}} with a bacterial infection, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> restricted to playing the doubles alongside Greg Rusedski, which they lost. With Arvind Parmar also losing in the singles, Great Britain were beaten 3–2.|$|E
5|$|Tapp is {{beginning}} to learn that these people all have a dark connection to him. He proceeds to {{the offices of the}} building and finds Oswald McGullicuty in the next Jigsaw trap. Jigsaw felt that Oswald was perverting his message, and <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> placed into a Folding Table Trap, which would snap his body in half if Tapp failed to save him. Tapp saves Oswald, but he is swiftly killed by a compacting metal slab before either have a chance to react.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Tsukasa Masuko, with arrangements by Masuko and Tatsuya Nishiwaki. Masuko considered Shin Megami Tensei {{to be an}} experimental work: {{it was the first}} time he had created music for the Super Famicom, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not familiar with the console's specifications. During composition, he needed to check the specifications repeatedly to see what he could do within the hardware limitations. For the PC Engine port, the music was arranged by Hitoshi Sakimoto.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Test. Brown injured a finger while fielding in the first innings, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unable to bat in Australia's first innings. In the second innings, Australia's {{makeshift}} openers Harvey and Sam Loxton chased down the 122 runs for victory to complete a 10-wicket win in less than an hour.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{remained at}} Richon until 18 December, carrying out military training and playing sports. Then they {{moved back to}} Rafa, where a school was established. It was discovered that before the war one of the regiment's troopers had been a schools inspector, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> immediately promoted to major, taking charge of lessons.|$|E
5|$|When Secretariat first {{retired to}} Claiborne Farm, his sperm showed {{some signs of}} immaturity, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bred to three non-Thoroughbred mares in December 1973 to test his fertility. One of these, an Appaloosa named Leola, {{produced}} Secretariat's first foal in November 1974. Named First Secretary, the foal was a chestnut like his sire, but spotted like his dam.|$|E

The hospital was not equipped to treat Udin's wounds, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> transferred to Bethesda Hospital, a Protestant institution in Yogyakarta. In a coma, {{he was diagnosed with}} a fractured skull; a shard of bone had also punctured his skull.|$|E
5|$|A new Baroque {{building}} was constructed on {{site of the}} first Castellania by the same Grand Master, creating significant employment as Pinto had hoped for, with works commencing in 1757. Throughout the course of construction, prisoners were held in a torre near Valletta's Porta Reale, probably the tower of Saint James Cavalier. The new Castellania was built to a design by the architect Francesco Zerafa, but he died before its completion, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> substituted by the architect Giuseppe Bonici. Zerafa is accredited for the main design, and for the subjected building he has post mortem {{established himself as a}} respected architect. The edifice was completed in 1760, with its chapel being consecrated on 15 November of that year. As a general rule, buildings in Valletta were required to be ready within three-years period from start to completion. The prisoners were transferred to the new prison three days later, on 18 November 1760.|$|E
5|$|After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest {{attempts}} {{to start his}} career as a writer. He chose a difficult time in American publishing to do <b>so.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> the first well-known American to try to live by writing alone and was hampered by the lack of an international copyright law. Publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans. The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837. There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues and publishers often refused to pay their writers, or paid them much later than they promised. Throughout his {{attempts to}} live as a writer, Poe repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa, Harvey embarrassed the Board of Control when he frankly discussed his financial situation during a television interview. He {{revealed that the}} players earned only £85 per Test {{and that he was}} almost broke, despite being an automatic selection for Australia. Ten years of making time for cricket had disrupted his working life, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> contemplating a move to South Africa, the homeland of his wife, Iris. Consequently, Harvey received a job offer to work as a sales supervisor for a glass manufacturer in Sydney, so he moved to New South Wales and gave up the Victorian captaincy. As a new player to NSW, he was behind vice-captain Richie Benaud in the state's pecking order, despite being the Test vice-captain, ahead of Benaud. Fatefully, Craig was unfit {{for the start of the}} 1958–59 season, due to the after-effects of hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} Howard {{how he could}} have made that $1000 raise, to which Howard replied that poker was all about making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 pot {{with a pair of}} 10s shows while Howard had just a Queen high. By raising $1000, Howard was possibly representing a Queen in the hole and trying to buy the pot at the point. The Kid only had to put in another $1000 into a $4000, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since he only had to be right 1 in 5 times to break even. Howard seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise as well as the $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E
5|$|Allen did {{not feel}} suited to working in a {{department}} store, and on his return home took {{a job with the}} stockbroking company David Bevan and Co. Consequently, he played little cricket in 1933. He planned to be unavailable for the Test matches against the West Indies, but Larwood was injured and Voce out of form, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> persuaded to play in the first Test. He played little thereafter that season and declined an invitation to tour India with an MCC team. In three games that season, he scored 199 runs and took 13 wickets. That December, he was elected {{as a member of the}} Stock Exchange.|$|E

5|$|Although Aucouturier had {{abandoned}} in the first stage, and so was not eligible for the general classification, he could still start {{the rest of the}} stages. In the second stage, Aucouturier was able to win the sprint. In the third stage, the cyclists who were competing for the general classification started one hour earlier than the other cyclists, including Aucouturier. At the end of that stage, a group of four cyclists had broken away, and Eugène Brange won the sprint. Aucouturier finished 27 minutes later, but this meant that he had run the course 33 minutes faster, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> declared the winner of the stage. Garin retained the lead, helped by a crash of second-placed Pagie in the second stage, which eliminated him from the race.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the idea}} of {{becoming}} a marine zoologist interested him, Franco had always secretly wanted to become an actor but feared being rejected. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as an English major, but dropped out after his first year against his parents' wishes {{to pursue a career}} as an actor, since {{he would have had to}} wait two years to audition for their acting program. Franco instead chose to take acting lessons with Robert Carnegie at the Playhouse West. Around this time, Franco took up a late-night job at McDonald's to support himself because his parents refused to do <b>so.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a vegetarian until working there. While working at the establishment, he would practice accents on customers, an experience he remembered nostalgically in a 2015 Washington Post editorial ("McDonald’s was there for me when no one else was").|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} June 1860, Rossier was in Shanghai, and it {{is likely}} that he visited the city in an attempt to gain {{permission}} to accompany the Anglo-French military expedition that had already arrived in northern China and thereby fulfill his commission to document the Second Opium War. If <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful; both forces had already hired photographers to document the mission. The British forces were accompanied by the photographers Felice Beato and John Papillon, and the French by Antoine Fauchery, Lieutenant-Colonel Du Pin, and possibly also by Louis Legrand. Although Rossier failed even to embark on the mission he had been hired to document, he remained in East Asia for some time longer.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its first-choice team in {{the tour}} opener, which was usually against Worcestershire. Bradman and his co-selectors felt that Loxton was not among the 11 strongest players, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not selected against Worcestershire. Loxton’s debut had come about because first-choice opener Arthur Morris had been rested from the Fifth Test so that the selectors could trial potential players for the 1948 tour. Sid Barnes had opened in that match with Bill Brown. Morris and Barnes were Bradman's preferred pair and they opened against Worcestershire, while Brown, who was on his third tour of England, was played out of position in the middle-order, pushing Loxton out of the team. Loxton looked on as Brown made 25 and Australia won by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Balard found bromine {{chemicals}} in the ash of seaweed from the salt marshes of Montpellier. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus he tried {{to prove that the}} substance was iodine monochloride (ICl), but after failing to do <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> sure that he had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the Latin word muria for brine.|$|E
5|$|Despite his popularity, Goldschmidt {{left office}} after only one term, {{becoming}} an influential and controversial lobbyist. Over the next dozen years or <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> criticized by editorial boards and Oregonians for {{several of the}} causes he supported, including backing the forestry corporation, Weyerhaeuser in its hostile takeover of Oregon's Willamette Industries and his advocacy for a private investment firm {{in its attempt to}} take over Portland General Electric, a local utility company. In 2003, Governor Ted Kulongoski appointed him to the Oregon Board of Higher Education, a position he resigned after admitting he had a sexual relationship with a minor girl 30 years earlier.|$|E

60|$|While {{thou art}} {{therefore}} thinking on him, as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{the throne of}} grace, forget him not as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> priest and sacrifice; for as a priest he makes atonement; {{but there is no}} atonement made for sin without a sacrifice. Now, as Christ <b>is</b> a sacrifice, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to be considered as passive, or a sufferer; as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a priest, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> active, or one that hath offered up himself; as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> an altar, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to be considered as God; for in and upon the power of his Godhead he offered up himself. The altar then was not the cross, as some have foolishly imagined. But as a throne, a throne of grace; <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to be considered as distinct from these three things, as I also have hinted before. Wouldst thou then know this throne of grace, where God sits to hear prayers and give grace? then cast the eyes of thy soul about, and look till thou findest the Lamb there; a Lamb there 'as it had been slain,' for by this thou shalt know thou art right. A slain Lamb, or a Lamb as it had been slain, when it is seen by a supplicant {{in the midst of the}} throne, whither <b>he</b> <b>is</b> come for grace, is a blessed sight! A blessed sight indeed! And it informs him <b>he</b> <b>is</b> where <b>he</b> should <b>be.</b>|$|R
