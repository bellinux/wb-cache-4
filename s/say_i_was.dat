500|$|In {{describing}} {{life on a}} long sea voyage, Poe {{also drew}} from personal experience. In 1815, a six-year-old Poe along with his foster-parents traveled from Norfolk, Virginia to Liverpool, England, a journey of 34 days. During the difficult trip, young Poe asked his foster father, John Allan, to include him in a letter he was writing. Allan wrote, [...] "Edgar says Pa say something for me, <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{not afraid of the}} sea." [...] The family returned to the United States in 1820 aboard the Martha and docked in New York after 31 days. Closer to the time Poe wrote his novel, he had sailed during his military career, the longest trip being from Boston to Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E

Schwabe persuaded other émigrés to visit the unknown woman, including Zinaida Tolstoy, a friend of Tsarina Alexandra. Eventually Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden, a former lady-in-waiting to the Tsarina, visited the asylum with Tolstoy. On seeing the woman, Buxhoeveden declared [...] "She's too short for Tatiana," [...] and left convinced the woman was not a Russian grand duchess.

From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views: [...] "I can't <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> blacklisted, but I was greylisted." [...] However, in her 2005 autobiography, My Life So Far, she rejected such simplification. [...] "The suggestion is that because of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth is that my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed." [...] She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life. Her return to acting in a series of 'issue-driven' films reflected this new focus.|$|E

Vulović's deteriorating health prevented her from taking part in annual commemorations at Srbská Kamenice, which she had previously attended for many years.

[...] Holloway's film career continued simultaneously with his stage work; one example was the 1956 comedy Jumping for Joy.

500|$|In early 1942, {{the company}} that Doc Goddard worked for {{required}} him to relocate to West Virginia.

500|$|In June 1837 Chopin visited London incognito in {{the company}} of the piano {{manufacturer}} Camille Pleyel where he played at a musical soirée at the house of English piano maker James Broadwood. On his return to Paris, his association with Sand began in earnest, {{and by the end of}} June 1838 they had become lovers. Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: [...] "I must <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away..." [...] The two spent a miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of Chopin and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover Félicien Mallefille. After discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic people of Majorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find. This compelled the group to take lodgings in a former Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather.|$|E
