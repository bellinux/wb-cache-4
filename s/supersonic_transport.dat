5|$|The {{origins of}} the Concorde project date to the early 1950s, when Arnold Hall, {{director}} of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) asked Morien Morgan to form a committee to study the <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> (SST) concept. The group {{met for the first}} time in February 1954 and delivered their first report in April 1955.|$|E
5|$|The {{data from}} the XB-70 test flights and {{aerospace}} materials development {{were used in the}} later B-1 bomber program, the American <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> (SST) program, and via espionage, the Soviet Union's Tupolev Tu-144 SST program. The development of the Lockheed U-2 and the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft, as well as the XB-70, prompted Soviet aerospace engineers to design and develop their high-altitude and high-speed MiG-25 interceptor.|$|E
5|$|After the 1962 World's Fair and {{introduction}} of the Seattle Center Monorail, a proposal was drawn up by fair organizers to extend the system to the airport. The plan, supported by Governor Albert D. Rosellini, was ultimately rejected by incoming Governor Daniel J. Evans in favor of completing Interstate 5. The Forward Thrust rapid transit plan, which was rejected by voters in 1968 and 1970, included Sea-Tac Airport in its long-term plans for service; the airport was excluded from the first phase because of possible changes brought by airport expansion and the <b>Supersonic</b> <b>Transport</b> program.|$|E

Operation Bongo).|$|R

40|$|Future <b>supersonic</b> <b>transports</b> {{will have}} to provide {{improvement}} {{in the areas of}} economics, range, and emissions relative to the present generation of <b>supersonic</b> <b>transports,</b> as well as meeting or improving upon FAR 36 noise goals. This paper covers the promising propulsion systems including variable-cycle engine concepts for long-range <b>supersonic</b> commercial <b>transport</b> application. The benefits of applying advanced propulsion technology to solve the economic and environmental problems are reviewed. The advanced propulsion technologies covered are in the areas of structures, materials, cooling techniques, aerodynamics, variable engine geometry, jet noise suppressors, acoustic treatment, and low-emission burners. The results of applying the advanced propulsion technology are presented in terms of improvement in overall system takeoff gross weight and return on investment...|$|R
5|$|On 1 October 1956 the Ministry of Supply asked Morgan {{to form a}} {{new study}} group, the <b>Supersonic</b> <b>Transport</b> Advisory Committee (STAC), with the {{explicit}} goal of developing a practical SST design and finding industry partners to build it. At the very first meeting, on 5 November 1956, {{the decision was made to}} fund the development of a test bed aircraft to examine the low-speed performance of the slender delta, a contract that eventually produced the Handley Page HP.115. This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as 69mph, about ⅓ that of the F-104 Starfighter.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{cancelled}} the Boeing 2707, its rival <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> programme, in 1971. Observers {{have suggested}} that opposition to Concorde on grounds of noise pollution had been encouraged by the United States Government, as it lacked its own competitor. The US, India, and Malaysia all ruled out Concorde supersonic flights over the noise concern, although some of these restrictions were later relaxed. Professor Douglas Ross characterised restrictions placed upon Concorde operations by President Jimmy Carter's administration as having been an act of protectionism of American aircraft manufacturers. Concorde flew to an altitude of 68,000ft (20,700m) during a test flight in June 1973.|$|E
5|$|Concorde {{produced}} {{nitrogen oxides}} in its exhaust, which, despite complicated interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals, are understood {{to result in}} degradation to the ozone layer at the stratospheric altitudes it cruised. It has been pointed out that other, lower-flying, airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere, but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted. The small fleet meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible. In 1995, David Fahey, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States, warned that a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft with exhausts similar to Concorde might produce in a 2 per cent drop in global ozone levels, much higher than previously thought. Each 1 per cent drop in ozone is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 per cent. Dr Fahey said if these particles are produced by highly oxidised sulphur in the fuel, as he believed, then removing sulphur in the fuel will reduce the ozone-destroying impact of <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport.</b>|$|E

5|$|In November 2011, Kaye {{announced}} that particles of pure (unalloyed) titanium {{had also been}} found on the tie. He explained that titanium, which was much rarer in the 1970s than it is today, {{was at that time}} found only in metal fabrication or production facilities, or at chemical companies using it (combined with aluminum) to store extremely corrosive substances. The findings suggested that Cooper may have been a chemist or a metallurgist, or possibly an engineer or manager (the only employees who wore ties in such facilities at that time) in a metal or chemical manufacturing plant, or at a company that recovered scrap metal from those types of factories. In January 2017, Kaye reported that rare earth minerals such as cerium and strontium sulfide had also been identified among particles from the tie. One of the rare applications for such elements in the 1970s was Boeing's <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> development project, suggesting the possibility that Cooper was a Boeing employee. Other possible sources of the material included plants that manufactured cathode ray tubes, such as the Portland firms Teledyne and Tektronix.|$|E
25|$|Besides the H-IIA/B and Epsilon rockets, JAXA is also {{developing}} technology for a next-generation <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> {{that could become}} the commercial replacement for the Concorde. The design goal of the project (working name Next Generation <b>Supersonic</b> <b>Transport)</b> {{is to develop a}} jet that can carry 300 passengers at Mach 2. A subscale model of the jet underwent aerodynamic testing in September and October 2005 in Australia. In 2015 JAXA performed tests aimed at reducing the effects of super sonic flight under the D-SEND program. The economic success of such a project is still unclear, and as a consequence the project has been met with limited interest from Japanese aerospace companies like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries so far.|$|E
25|$|The Convair Model 58-9 was a {{proposed}} American <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport,</b> {{developed by the}} Convair division of General Dynamics and intended to carry fifty-two passengers at over Mach 2.

25|$|Many design {{decisions}} were driven by TWA, which envisioned {{it would be}} its hub, with 747s and <b>Supersonic</b> <b>Transports</b> whisking people from America's heartland to all points on the globe.

25|$|Plans {{initiated}} by then-governor Nelson Rockefeller changed that. With <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> (SST) considered {{at the time}} to be the next major development in air travel, Rockefeller wanted New York to have an airport that could handle both the SSTs and regular jets. Accordingly, plans were drawn up for a major expansion of the airport.|$|E
25|$|After {{retiring}} from the Air Force, Townsend joined the Boeing Company {{as the head of}} the <b>Supersonic</b> <b>Transport</b> (SST) operations organization. After the SST program was cancelled in 1971, he supported a number of other Boeing efforts including the E-4 Advanced Airborne Command Post, the YC-14, the Microwave Landing System, and the B-2 Spirit. Townsend retired from Boeing in 1986.|$|E
25|$|Pan Am {{was one of}} {{the first}} three {{airlines}} to sign options for the Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde, but like other airlines that took out options – with the exception of BOAC and Air France — it did not purchase the supersonic jet. Pan Am was the first U.S. airline to sign for the Boeing 2707, the American <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> (SST) project, with 15 delivery positions reserved; these aircraft never saw service after Congress voted against additional funding in 1971.|$|E

50|$|The high per-passenger {{takeoff weight}} makes it {{difficult}} to obtain a good fuel fraction. This issue, along with the challenge presented by supersonic lift/drag ratios, greatly limits the range of <b>supersonic</b> <b>transports.</b> Because long distance routes were not a viable option, airlines had little interest in buying the jets.|$|R
25|$|Nonstop {{flights to}} Chicago and Newark Liberty International Airport in {{northeast}} New Jersey started in late 1946, but nonstops didn't reach west beyond St. Louis and New Orleans until January 1962. Nonstop transatlantic flights to Europe began in 1970. In the late 1970s and early 1980s Air Florida had a hub at MIA, with a nonstop flight to London, England which it acquired from National upon the latter's merger with Pan Am. Air Florida ceased operations in 1982 {{after the crash}} of Air Florida Flight 90. British Airways flew a Concorde SST (<b>supersonic</b> <b>transport)</b> triserial between Miami and London via Washington, D.C. (Dulles International Airport) from 1984 to 1991.|$|E
25|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was under}} construction when the minister, Duncan Sandys, announced {{the decision to}} cancel its development in 1957. It had been suspected {{that by the time}} the aircraft came into service a decade later, by which time it was anticipated {{that it would have been}} vulnerable to Soviet advances in anti-aircraft missile technology. Effort was instead transferred to the Blue Streak medium-range ballistic missile instead, while the sole 730 test fuselage was cut up. The Bristol 188 project continued despite the cancellation of the 730. Aspects and influences of the Avro 730 encouraged studies at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, into <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> aircraft, which in turn eventually contributed to the development effort behind Concorde.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, Dunning {{was often}} {{consulted}} on nuclear technology matters by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Rear Admiral Hyman G.

50|$|Carol Berman (born September 21, 1923) is a New York Democratic Party {{politician}} from Lawrence, in Nassau County, New York, United States, {{who served}} in the New York State Senate from 1979 to 1984.

25|$|The ATLB heard British Eagle's {{applications}}, Caledonian's counter {{applications and}} BOAC's objections in early 1968. Following {{the conclusion of}} the transatlantic scheduled licensing hearings in mid-1968, the ATLB rejected British Eagle's and Caledonian's applications. It felt that the independents generally lacked the financial strength to acquire the then latest widebodied and <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> (SST) aircraft for their proposed services and that these airlines had insufficient economies of scale to enable them to compete with BOAC and the American carriers on a level playing field. It also felt that it would take the independents too long to make these services profitable. In British Eagle's case, the ATLB was impressed with the airline's well-equipped and competent engineering organisation but questioned its ability to finance the envisaged expansion because it considered the company seriously undercapitalised for its existing operations.|$|E
25|$|On 21 January 1976, Air France {{operated}} its inaugural <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> (SST) {{service on}} the Paris (Charles de Gaulle) to Rio (via Dakar) route with Anglo-French BAC-Aérospatiale Concorde F-BVFA. Supersonic services from Paris (CDG) to Washington Dulles International Airport began on 24 May 1976, also with F-BVFA. Service to New York (JFK) – the only remaining Concorde service until its end – commenced on 22 November 1977. Paris to New York was flown in 3 hours 23 minutes, at about twice the speed of sound. Approval for flights to the United States was initially withheld due to noise protests. Eventually, services to Mexico City via Washington, D.C. were started. Air France became {{one of only two}} airlines – British Airways being the other – to regularly operate supersonic services, and continued daily transatlantic Concorde service until late May 2003.|$|E
500|$|The American designs, the [...] "SST" [...] project (for <b>Supersonic</b> <b>Transport)</b> {{were the}} Boeing 2707 and the Lockheed L-2000. These {{were to have}} been larger, with seating for up to 300 people. Running a few years behind Concorde, the Boeing 2707 was {{redesigned}} to a cropped delta layout; the extra cost of these changes helped to kill the project. The operation of US military aircraft such as the XB-70 Valkyrie and B-58 Hustler had shown that sonic booms were quite capable of reaching the ground, and the experience from the Oklahoma City sonic boom tests led to the same environmental concerns that hindered the commercial success of Concorde. The American government cancelled its SST project in 1971, after having spent more than $1billion.|$|E
50|$|Turbojets are {{the second}} oldest type; {{it has a}} high, usually supersonic, exhaust speed and low frontal cross-section, and so is best suited to high-speed, usually supersonic, flight. Although once widely used, they are {{relatively}} inefficient compared to turboprop and turbofans for subsonic flight. The last major aircraft to use turbojets were Concorde and Tu-144 <b>supersonic</b> <b>transports.</b>|$|R

40|$|Generated {{primarily}} by volcanic explosions, {{a layer of}} submicron silicate particles and particles made of concentrated sulfuric acids solution {{is present in the}} stratosphere. Flights through the stratosphere may be a future source of stratospheric aerosols, since the effluent from <b>supersonic</b> <b>transports</b> contains sulfurous gases (which will be converted to H 2 SO 4) while the exhaust from Space Shuttles contains tiny aluminum oxide particles. Global heat balance calculations have shown that the stratospheric aerosols have made important contributions to some climatic changes. In the present paper, accurate radiative transfer calculations of the globally-averaged surface temperature (T) are carried out to estimate the sensitivity of the climate to changes in the number of stratospheric aerosols. The results obtained for a specified model atmosphere, including a vertical profile of the aerosols, indicate that the climate is unlikely to be affected by <b>supersonic</b> <b>transports</b> and Space Shuttles, during the next decades...|$|R
