40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{complete}} analysis of the sky luminance distribution data measured with a sky scanner at the International Daylight Measurement Program station in Lyon. Besides presentation of the sky luminance distribution, we also derive the CIE <b>sky</b> <b>type</b> based on the CIE S 011 / 2003 standard. The CIE <b>sky</b> <b>type</b> is based on gradation and indicatrix functions. Determination of the gradation and indicatrix group is based on the calculation of luminance ratio between two elements on every almucantar. Since there are six gradation and six indicatrix groups, we have 36 combinations but only 15 of them are listed in the CIE standard. Since some of combinations are really rare, we provide a table to show how to allocate 36 combinations to 15 standard CIE <b>sky</b> <b>types.</b> At the end of the paper, we present frequencies of occurrence of CIE <b>sky</b> <b>types</b> in Lyon...|$|R

40|$|The {{diffuse light}} {{reaching}} the ground varies with instantaneous physical {{state of the}} atmosphere, specifically with atmospheric turbidity, vertical stratification of attenuating and scattering constituents, cloud coverage and many others. Despite this complexity, a set of empirical models based on so-called homogeneous <b>sky</b> <b>types</b> is widely used to simulate the real lighting conditions. However, the <b>sky</b> <b>type</b> classification can be influenced by multiple scattering of light. Even if multiple scattering is essentially important under low elevation angles and high turbidity conditions, it is quite often ignored – e. g. when modelling the luminance patterns. As a consequence, the interpretation of experimental data can suffer from the omission of multiple scattering effects. Since multiple scattering smoothes the luminance patterns, the neighbouring <b>sky</b> <b>types</b> {{may be subject to}} blurring, and thus it might be difficult to distinguish them in automated data processing. In this paper we introduce a model that lowers the uncertainties caused by multiple scattering, so the subsequent numerical routines will definitely profit from more accurate identification of <b>sky</b> <b>types.</b> 1...|$|R

The latter often are meant only as attractive features to be shown to university visitors and students interested in architectural design or window applications but seldom are used for daylight research as measuring devices because these are not calibrated or are not modeling the standard ISO/CIE <b>sky</b> <b>types.</b> During the sixtieth of the last century was designed and built in the SAS Daylight laboratory an artificial sky simulating the CIE Overcast and unity (Lambertian) skies and then the recently CIE Clear Sky with the artificial sun.

After forty years since the Bratislava artificial sky was in service this laboratory equipment became almost a historical remnant with its artificial lighting by incandescent reflectors and robust theatrical dimming system. New technology progress in artificial light sources, reduction of energy demands and computer checking possibilities as well as new knowledge in daylight science in the determination of new ISO/CIE <b>sky</b> <b>types</b> form new requirements for designing or refurbishing artificial skies.

Using 1  Hz data recorded by as many as 99 pyranometers during the HD(CP) 2 Observational Prototype Experiment (HOPE), we analyze field variability of clear-sky index k * (i. e., irradiance normalized to clear-sky conditions) and sub-minute k * increments (i. e., changes over specified intervals of time) for distances between tens of meters and about 10  km. By means of a simple classification scheme based on k * statistics, we identify overcast, clear, and mixed sky conditions, and demonstrate that the last of these is the most potentially problematic in terms of short-term PV power fluctuations. Under mixed conditions, the probability of relatively strong k * increments of ± 0. 5 is approximately twice as high compared to increment statistics computed without conditioning by <b>sky</b> <b>type.</b> Additionally, spatial autocorrelation structures of k * increment fields differ considerably between <b>sky</b> <b>types.</b> While the profiles for overcast and clear skies mostly resemble the predictions of a simple model published by Hoff and Perez (2012), {{this is not the case}} for mixed conditions.

Simultaneous daylight measurements were made in two identical atrium models under real skies. One atrium model had an A-frame glazed roof with obstructions created by white structural elements. The second model had a flat glass roof with no obstructions. For overcast skies it was found that applying the plan area obstruction correction factor to daylight levels usually underestimated the loss of light due to the obstructions, typically by 10 - 15 %. For the partly cloudy sky the effects of roof shape and obstruction on atrium daylight levels were complex. The inclined glazed surfaces and structural elements could reflect the bright skylight either away from or into the atrium. Under some circumstances the presence of the obstructions in the roof increased the illuminance levels on north-and east-facing atrium surfaces (compared with the clear flat roof), while for south- and west-facing surfaces illuminance levels decreased...|$|R
