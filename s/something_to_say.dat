5|$|A video {{documentary}} titled Nothing to Say, {{directed and}} produced by Benjamin Eisner, {{was released in}} early 2008, highlighting Matthew West's time of silence and vocal recovery in 2007. In February 2008, the documentary was available exclusively in Family Christian Stores as a CD/DVD combo pack with West's album <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> <b>Say.</b>|$|E
5|$|This ending was the {{favourite}} {{amongst the}} actors. Mangan {{said that the}} alternative ending was the best moment {{in the whole of}} Green Wing. However, the alternative ending was rejected and the writers favoured the ending that was eventually broadcast. It is believed that the alternative ending would have been broadcast if a third series was being made, as that ending was much more ambiguous, since Alan and Joanna are still seen alive and Mac tells Caroline that he still has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E

25|$|As desired and expected, news of {{a contest}} of such {{distance}} evoked strong enthusiasm both within and without the motorsport community. Newspaper and trade magazine articles used ever-new superlatives for the challenges expected to soon face both drivers and engineers, and continuing discussion throughout the spring and winter kept the race as the primary conversation piece of the average citizen. Everyone, it seemed, had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about it.|$|E

In 1975, Buster Brown released an album, <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> <b>Say,</b> on Mushroom Records/Festival Records before disbanding in November that year.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} history is finished. The endeavour is complete. If you'd asked me 20 years ago whether we'd be attempting such a mammoth task, I'd have said 'Don't be ridiculous'.

25|$|Through water {{communications}} systems are {{more suitable for}} scuba as the diver is not encumbered by a communications cable, but they can be fitted to surface supplied equipment if desired. Most through water systems have a Push To Talk (PTT) system, so that high power is only used to transmit the signal when the diver has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> For commercial diving applications this is a disadvantage, in that the supervisor can not monitor the condition of the divers by hearing them breathe.|$|E

25|$|All of {{them had}} <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the Christian form of the Logos. The Catholic Church found it {{necessary}} to distinguish between the Christian logos and that of Heraclitus as part of its ideological distancing from paganism. The necessity to convert by defeating paganism was of paramount importance. Hippolytus of Rome therefore identifies Heraclitus along with the other Pre-Socratics (and Academics) as sources of heresy. Church use of the methods and conclusions of ancient philosophy as such was as yet far in the future, even though many were converted philosophers.|$|E
25|$|The master {{constraint}} programme {{has evolved}} into a fully combinatorial treatment of gravity known as Algebraic Quantum Gravity (AQG). The non-graph changing master constraint operator is adapted in the framework of algebraic quantum gravity. While AQG is inspired by LQG, it differs drastically from it because in AQG there is fundamentally no topology or differential structure â€“ it is background independent in a more generalized sense and could possibly have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about topology change. In this new formulation of quantum gravity AQG semiclassical states always control the fluctuations of all present degrees of freedom. This makes the AQG semiclassical analysis superior over that of LQG, and {{progress has been made in}} establishing it has the correct semiclassical limit and providing contact with familiar low energy physics.|$|E
25|$|When Joplin and her back-up band {{performed}} at Vets Memorial Auditorium in Columbus, Ohio, on Sunday night, May 11, 1969, Columbus Dispatch reviewer John Huddy wrote: Frequently suggestive {{with a series}} of limited but obvious moves, Miss Joplin wears hip-hugging silk bellbottoms and alternates between a wail and a teeth-rattling scream. Like Elvis in his pelvis-moving days or Wayne Cochran with his towering hairdo, Janis is a curiosity as well as a musical attraction. She cultivates a Madame of Rock image, lounging against an organ, exchanging profanities with bandsmen, cackling coarsely at private jokes, even taking a belt or two while onstage. She also has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in her songs, about the raw and rudimentary dimensions of sex, love and life. She gets her point across, splitting a few eardrums in the process. Opening the Joplin concert were Teegarden and Van Winkle, an organ-drums duo... Before her concert, Miss Joplin walked into the lobby and watched customers arrive. She was not recognized.|$|E

500|$|Kavner has {{frequently}} appeared in Woody Allen films, having roles in Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), Radio Days (1987), New York Stories (1989), Alice (1990), Shadows and Fog (1991), the television movie Don't Drink the Water (1994) and Deconstructing Harry (1997). Allen described her as [...] "a naturally funny person. When {{she does a}} scene, you listen to her and look at her, and the prism through which it's all filtered is funny." [...] Kavner believes he is [...] "a true filmmaker, one that has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> continually experimenting on different themes within his own film-making", adding that [...] "anything [...] ever does, I always want to do, [...] I don't even have to read it." ...|$|E
500|$|Starting as an {{independent}} musician in the late 1990s, he released three independent albums before signing with Universal South Records. With the release of his Dove Award-winning debut album, Happy, released in 2003, his first radio single, [...] "More", stayed at No. 1 on Christian Adult Contemporary charts for nine weeks and received two Dove Award nominations. His second album, History, {{was followed by a}} 2006 re-release of the originally independent album, Sellout. In 2007, he faced vocal issues that threatened his career with two months of prescribed vocal rest. His third studio album, <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> <b>Say,</b> also enjoyed chart success with No. 1 hits, [...] "You Are Everything" [...] and [...] "The Motions".|$|E
500|$|Iyall was {{observed}} by Mother Jones {{to be among}} {{a new group of}} female fronted rock bands that displayed a [...] "tough, wry, street-wise, [...] cynical" [...] attitude and sought to redefine {{the role of women in}} rock music. She developed a sizable following for her writing that covered topics like [...] "frustrated desire [...] sexually motivated rage" [...] from a female perspective. Critics praised her lyrics for their [...] "searing imagery", [...] "seething poetics", and [...] "" [...] "My approach was always that I had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> I had a point of view," [...] Iyall said, commenting on her outspokeness.

500|$|He {{was sentenced}} to life on June 27, 1930, on the old murder charge. He {{remained}} silent during the trial. Cascioferro had been arrested some 69 times before and always had been acquitted, but this time it was different. After hearing the sentence the president of the court asked Cascioferro if he had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in his defense. Cascioferro stood up and said: [...] "Gentlemen, as you have been unable to obtain proof of any of the numerous crimes I have committed, you have been reduced to condemning me for the only one I never committed." [...] The [...] "iron prefect", as Mori was known, wanted to give maximum publicity to the event. He had posters printed with pictures of Cascioferro and the text of the court sentence.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} style also rates highly; {{writing in}} The Guardian, Mark Lawson called the pilot [...] "glossier and more populist than Newman's earlier work". Wry reference {{is made to}} Deed and Jo's relationship, with Lawson writing that Deed [...] "is desperate to conduct his own forensic investigation of the body fluids of the attractive defence QC". Writing on the programme's accessibility to an audience, Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian calls it [...] "talkative in the way television plays used to be when they had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> But it is notable that, in a profession famous for obfuscation, Deed uses only the most pellucid English". Banks-Smith has also drawn attention to the masculine skew the programme has; [...] "Judge John Deed [...] is catnip to the ladies. These are [...] called Georgie, Charlie, Jo andâ€”when Rita defies abbreviationâ€”Coop".|$|E
500|$|Matthew West's album, <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> <b>Say,</b> was {{released}} on January 15, 2008. It reached No. 8 on Billboard's Top Christian albums chart, and peaked at No. 159 on the Billboard 200 chart, making it his first Billboard 200 album [...] It was produced by Brown Bannister, Ed Cash, and Christopher Stevens. West {{said in an interview}} that all of the album's songs had already been written and the title [...] "Something to Say" [...] had already been decided [...] "months before I found out that I was going to have nothing to say." [...] The first radio single released from the album was [...] "You Are Everything". In March 2008, the song reached No. 1 on R's Christian AC chart. [...] "Something to Say", the album's title track, was also released to radio, receiving airplay in June 2008.|$|E
