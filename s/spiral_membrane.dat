Thanks to an exptl. mapping of the irreversible fouling existing in a <b>spiral</b> <b>membrane</b> of 6. 5 m 2 area, this paper shows {{that it is not}} systematically true and that the fouling distribution can be much more complex. This paper shows also in what extent the mapping of the irreversible fouling existing in a <b>spiral</b> <b>membrane</b> is a powerful approach to deal with the role of the velocity/turbulences gradient that can be exptl. studied independently of the transmembrane pressure gradient in appropriate filtering conditions. The fouling distribution suggests that the velocity/turbulences are roughly const. on 50 % of the membrane area located in its center when dealing with a radial dimension, whereas part of this mean position, velocity/turbulences can increase or decrease.

The investigated wastewater treatment plant consisted of the following phases: primary adsorption/coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation processes, biological treatment with the combination of trickling filter and activated sludge systems, secondary flocculation/sedimentation processes, and reverse osmosis (RO) system with <b>spiral</b> <b>membranes.</b> All the processes were developed in a continuous mode, while the RO experiment was performed with batch tests. Two types of BDF wastewater were considered: the first wastewater (WW 1) had an average total chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH and feed flow rate of 10, 850. 8 mg/L, 5. 9 and 2946. 7 L/h, respectively, while the second wastewater (WW 2) had an average total COD, pH and feed flow rate of 43, 898. 9 mg/L, 3. 3 and 2884. 6 L/h, respectively.

40|$|International audienceHydrophilisation of polyethersulfone (PES) based {{membrane}} {{is often}} achieved by addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) {{leading to a}} physical blend of the two polymers. This paper shows that {{the most commonly used}} membrane for UF in dairy industry is a PES/PVP based one. Nevertheless if hydrophilisation limits the organic fouling, PVP is also the Achilles heel of these membranes. It is particularly true when membranes are exposed to hypochlorite as it is the case for cleaning/disinfection steps. Evidencing the disappearance of PVP from a pristine PES/PVP membrane can be easily achieved by FTIR-ATR analyses. But when one wants to study the ageing of a membrane used in UF it gets more complicated: regardless of the cleaning efficiency the membrane always remains fouled by some proteins. As both PVP and proteins own chemical bounds leading to absorption at the same wavenumber in FTIR-ATR, it thereby prevents the easy highlighting of the PVP degradation. The aim {{of this paper is to}} propose a simple treatment of raw FTIR-ATR spectra to dissociate these two contributions, allowing consequently the study of the degradation of a fouled membrane.

40|$|This report {{presents}} ultrastructural {{observations on}} the cytological events that attend myelin formation occurring {{in the wake of}} demyelination in adult cat spinal cord. Lesions were induced in subpial cord by cerebrospinal fluid (c. s. f.) exchange (1, 2). Tissue from eleven cats at nine intervals from 19 to 460 days was fixed in situ by replacing c. s. f. with buffered OsO 4 and embedded in Araldite. After demyelination, axons are embraced by sheet-like glial processes. An occasional myelin sheath is first seen at 19 days; by 64 days, all axons are at least thinly myelinated. The cytoplasm of the myelin-forming cells, unlike that of either oligodendrocyte or fibrous astrocyte in normal cord, is dense with closely packed organelles and fine fibrils. Many of the myelinogenic cells become scarring astrocytes and at 460 days the lesion teems with their fibril-filled processes. Oligodendrocytes appear in the lesion after remyelination is under way. Phagocytes disappear gradually. A myelin sheath is formed by spiral wrapping of a sheet-like glial process around an axon. Where the first turn of the spiral is completed, a mesaxon is formed. As cytoplasm is lost from the process, the plasma membrane comes together along its outer and cytoplasmic surfaces to form compact myelin. Only a small amount of cytoplasm is retained; it is confined to the paramesaxonal region and, on the sheath exterior, to a longitudinal ridge which appears in profile as a small loop. This outer loop has the same rotational orientation as the inner mesaxon. These vestiges of <b>spiral</b> <b>membrane</b> wrapping are also found in normal adult and new-born cat cord. Nodes are present in all stages of remyelination and in normal adult cat and kitten cord. These observations suggest that myelin is reformed in the lesion in the same way it is first formed during normal development. The mechanism of myelin formation is basically similar to that proposed for peripheral nerve and amphibian and mammalian optic nerve; it does not agree with present views on the mechanism of myelinogenesis in mammalian brain and cord.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{objective}} laws investigation of mass transfer during removal of cake layer formed because of concentration polarization phenomenon from working surface of membrane and to the designing of effective process of regeneration of <b>spiral</b> wound <b>membrane</b> modules. The theoretical principle of process of precipitate removal from <b>membrane</b> surface in <b>spiral</b> wound <b>membrane</b> module was substantiated. The proposed method of regeneration allows recovering membrane flux without loss of selectivity and mechanical properties. The physical and mathematical models of fouled <b>spiral</b> wound <b>membrane</b> modules regeneration using of temperature cavitation phenomenon under subatmospheric pressure were developed. The equations of mass transfer kinetics in system liquid ? solid were expanded to marrow conditions in membrane channel. The objective laws of mass transfer during cake layer removal in channel of <b>spiral</b> wound <b>membrane</b> modules were defined experimentally. The results were generalized in a form of dimensionless equation for mass transportation equations coefficient determination. The proposed equation is reliable in a range of Reynolds from 0, 4 to 60. The proposed mathematical model was solved using numerical methods. The calculations using mathematical model were carried out and influence of hydrodynamic conditions, process temperature and cleaning solutions volume is determinated. The most rational flow regime is corresponding to Reynolds number values in a range from 15 to 25. The impact of process temperature and cleaning solution volume is negligible. It was experimentally defined that using of temperature cavitation phenomenon promote of increasing of intensity of cake layer removal process from <b>membrane</b> surface in <b>spiral</b> wound module. The regeneration can be carried out using environmentally acceptable cleaning solutions such as desalinated water and solutions of citric acid and sodium hydrocarbonate. The experimental examination of regeneration process effectiveness was carried out. The possibility of membrane flux recover for 90 ? 95 % was proved. It was shown by the experimental determination of total resistance to flux through the membrane of clean membrane module, fouled membrane module and regenerated membrane module that increase membrane flux after regeneration has occurred due to decreasing of cake layer resistance. Those results prove the principles of proposed physical model. The influence of technological parameters on mass transfer effectiveness during cake layer removal using temperature cavitation phenomenon was determinated. The methods of process intensification using periodical operating pressure increasing were substantiated. The effectiveness of periodical operating pressure increasing as an intensification technique which allows increase regeneration coefficient in 1, 5 times was proved. The factors which influence on regeneration process effectiveness were determinated using experiment planning method. The regression equations were obtained. The recommendations for using of proposed technique of fouled <b>spiral</b> wound <b>membrane</b> modules regeneration under absolute pressure of 0, 005 - 0, 009 MPa and operating temperature of 45 ?C were developed.

The objective of the research was to determine if the hollow fibre membranes used at Puhoi Valley Cheese can be replaced with <b>spiral</b> wound <b>membranes</b> without compromising the quality of cheese produced. In order to achieve the objective, feta cheese was produced using hollow fibre and spiral wound ultrafiltration pilot plants. The operating performances of the hollow fibre and <b>spiral</b> wound <b>membrane</b> units were compared. To ensure that the quality of cheese is maintained, the cheese manufactured on the pilot plant units was analysed in terms of composition, microbiology, texture and sensory properties. The cheese made using the hollow fibre membrane pilot plant was compared with the reference sample from Puhoi Valley Cheese as they use hollow fibre membranes to produce feta cheese. The cheese made from the <b>spiral</b> wound <b>membrane</b> unit was also compared to that made by the hollow fibre membrane pilot plant unit. The operating parameters such as the inlet and outlet pressure, pressure difference along the membrane, transmembrane pressure, flow rate, recycle rate (bleed off rate), temperature and the run time were recorded. The operating parameters of the hollow fibre and spiral wound runs were compared with the data from Puhoi Valley Cheese. The quality of cheese made on the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plant units were evaluated in terms of composition, texture, microbiology and sensory properties. The composition was defined by the fat, protein, total solids and salt contents. The fat content was determined by utilising the modified Schmid-Bondzynski-Ratzlaff method, protein by the Kjeldahl method, total solids by using the air drying oven and salt percentage by the volhard method. The texture of the cheese was determined by the fracturability and hardness from the compression curve generated using the single bite compression test. The microbiological testing was performed according to New Zealand testing methods for E. Coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coliforms and yeast and mould. The difference from the control method was utilised for sensory evaluation. The acid degree value method was used to determine the lipase activity in feta cheese. It was found from the composition, texture and sensory analysis that the cheese from the hollow fibre pilot plant was different from the cheese manufactured at Puhoi Valley Cheeses (PVC). The spiral wound cheeses were also found to be different to PVC cheese, however the spiral wound cheeses and the pilot plant hollow fibre cheese were the same. The differences between both the pilot plant cheeses and PVC cheese were in terms of the fat, salt, moisture contents and the lipase activity in the cheeses. The fat content in the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plant cheeses are lower in comparison to the PVC cheese. This difference in fat content is considered to be due to the difference in the fat to protein ratio of the milk concentrated on the pilot plant and the PVC ultrafiltration system. The lower fat content resulted in firmer cheese than PVC due to more cross linking between the protein strands in cheese. The salt content in the cheeses made using the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plants was lower than Puhoi Valley Cheese. This is considered to be due to the low ratio of brine volume to cheese volume used for salting the cheese. The salt content of brine decreases during brining; hence a low ratio of brine volume to cheese volume causes a significant decrease in brine concentration. The decrease in brine concentration decreases the salt intake of the cheese. As salt diffuses in the moisture diffuses out, lower salt content results in higher moisture content in the cheese. As mentioned, the moisture content of the hollow fibre pilot plant cheese was higher than the PVC cheese. The moisture content is inversely proportional to the total solids, hence higher moisture in pilot plant cheeses implies lower total solids than the PVC cheese. The lipase activity results showed that the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plant cheeses had higher lipase activity than the Puhoi valley cheese. The differences in lipase activity of the pilot plant cheeses and Puhoi Valley cheese were considered to be due to the incomplete inactivation of lipase present in milk during pasteurisation. The results from texture and sensory evaluation support the above mentioned differences. The microbiology results for all pilot plant cheeses were within the trigger limits set by Puhoi valley cheeses. The results from monitoring the operating parameters of both the pilot plant data show that the permeate flux decreases while the total solids in milk increase with time, which was also observed from the Puhoi Valley Cheese data. However, the rate of decrease of the permeate flux and the increase of the total solids in milk are dependent on the membrane area, feed volume, transmembrane pressure, pressure drop across the membrane and the flow characteristics. The rate of decrease in permeate flux and the rate of increase in the total solids of the hollow fibre runs and spiral wound runs are slightly different. The difference is due to the availability of larger membrane surface area and processing of larger feed volume of milk in the spiral wound runs. The transmembrane pressure and the pressure drop across the membrane were maintained as close as possible to Puhoi Valley Cheese. In conclusion, <b>spiral</b> wound <b>membranes</b> can be used to achieve the desired total solids concentration and successfully make the same feta cheese as the hollow fibre pilot plant. In order to make the same quality of feta cheese as Puhoi Valley Cheese using the <b>spiral</b> wound <b>membrane</b> pilot plant, the same composition of milk used for concentration at Puhoi Valley Cheese needs to be used on the spiral wound pilot plant unit. It is recommended that Puhoi Valley Cheeses should be replaced with <b>spiral</b> wound <b>membranes</b> if they are more economical in terms of cost than the hollow fibre membranes...|$|R

50|$|Cylindrical spirals {{myopathy}} is {{very rare}} with only 18 individual cases described as of 2013. The majority of cases are sporadic, and has been observed in only 3 families. It {{is characterized by the}} presence of cylindrical spirals as the main pathological finding in muscle biopsies. Cylindrical <b>spirals</b> are unusual <b>membrane</b> structures that have a <b>spiral</b> pattern. These <b>membrane</b> structures are seen during electron microscopic examination of the affected muscle. These structures merge into or are surrounded by tubular structures that resemble tubular aggregates. Tubular aggregates are abnormal accumulations of membranous tubules and have been observed {{in a wide variety of}} muscle diseases and originate from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Cylindrical spirals were first described in 1979 and were thought to be a non-specific reaction of skeletal muscle secondary to a metabolic disturbance or muscle fibre injury. The molecular basis of cylindrical spiral myopathy is currently unknown, however a genetic mutation affecting the sarcoplasmic reticulum in some patients seems likely, as SERCA1, calsequestrin, and RYR1 have been shown to bind to cylindrical spirals. Cylindrical spirals have also been shown to react with the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, which suggests that cylindrical spirals originate from mitochondria.|$|R
