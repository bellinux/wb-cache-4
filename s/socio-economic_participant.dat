Moreover, walking for transport and recreational walking significantly mediated the relationship between walkability and BMI. Sedentary behavior did not mediate associations of walkability with BMI or WHTR. These findings suggest that PA, but not sedentary behavior, is a mechanism by which walkability may affect adults' adiposity Planning for neighborhoods to be high in walkability could have favorable effects on physical activity and weight status...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to gather {{normative}} data regarding the phonological system of bilingual Creole-English children ages three and five and to compare performance to norms for English speaking children. The forty participants lived in Miami and represented low <b>socio-economic</b> groups. <b>Participants</b> were assessed using the Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation- 2 and a Haitian Creole Picture Naming Assessment. The results indicated that the percentage of correct phonemes in Creole (M= 91. 6) were not significantly different when compared to the correct production of the same phonemes in English (M= 92. 8). Further analysis revealed that the accuracy of all phonemes was higher for the five-year (M= 90. 8) as compared to the three-year-olds (M= 85) in Creole. In English, the five-year-olds performed better than the three-year-olds participants. These findings revealed patterns of phonological development in bilingual Creole/English Children similar to patterns reported in other bilingual children.

40|$|Abstract Background Longitudinal {{studies are}} crucial {{providers}} {{of information about}} the needs of an ageing population, but their external validity is affected if partipants drop out. Previous research has identified older age, impaired cognitive function, lower educational level, living alone, fewer social activities, and lower socio-economic status as predictors of attrition. Methods This project examined attrition in participants of the Whitehall II study aged between 51 – 71 years, using data from questionnaires participants have completed biennially since 1985 when the study began. We examine the possibility of two distinct forms of attrition – non-response and formally requesting to withdraw – and whether they have different predictors. Potential predictors were age, gender, marital status, occupational grade, retirement, home ownership, presence of longstanding illness, SF- 36 quality of life scores, social participation and educational level comparing participants and those who had withdrawn from the study. Results The two forms of attrition share many predictors and are associated but remain distinct. Being older, male, having a lower job grade, not being a home owner, not having a long standing illness, having higher levels of education, and not having retired, were all associated with a greater probability of non-response; being married was associated with higher probability in women and lower in men. Being older, male, having a lower job grade, not being a home owner, having lower SF- 36 scores, taking part in fewer social activities, and not having a long standing illness, were all associated with greater probability of withdrawal. Conclusions The results suggest a strong gender effect on both routes not previously considered in analyses of attrition.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} student-level variables that influence academic outcomes, {{and to determine}} the extent of their influence. In Study 1, final year secondary students (N = 654) completed a questionnaire gathering demographic information and measuring possible influencing variables. A number of these variables predicted academic achievement, including demographic, attitudinal, personality, study strategy and intelligence variables. Mathematical intelligence was the strongest predictor of achievement for all three achievement variables used, and was followed by school decile. Openness to experience and critical reasoning intelligence were the next strongest predictors of two achievement variables (proportion of Merit and Excellence credits attained and Level 3 attainment), while the third achievement variable (credits attained) was next best predicted by participant sex and verbal intelligence. Self-regulation skills were more beneficial when used by high intelligence participants. Likewise, critical thinking skills were more beneficial for high intelligence <b>participants,</b> high <b>socio-economic</b> <b>participants</b> and non-Māori participants. These interactions and the influence of participant openness to experience were further explored in a subsequent study, in which a second group of final year secondary students (N = 122) participated in a year-long study. Participants were divided into three groups: one group was taught critical thinking skills; a second group was taught strategies relating to the facets of openness to experience; and the third group was a control group. The control group was taught peer learning skills, which the previous study found did not relate to student achievement. The results of the interventions did not show a change in either the target variables or in student achievement for any of the three groups. Study 3 aimed to identify the student-level variables that influence academic outcomes for first year tertiary students and to determine the relative influence of each variable. This longitudinal study involved students at a New Zealand tertiary institution (N = 62) who had previously participated in Study 1 during their Year 13 year. Participants completed a questionnaire that collected demographic, attitudinal, personality and study strategy variables.

BACKGROUND: Longitudinal studies are crucial providers of information about the needs of an ageing population, but their external validity is affected if partipants drop out. Previous research has identified older age, impaired cognitive function, lower educational level, living alone, fewer social activities, and lower socio-economic status as predictors of attrition. METHODS: This project examined attrition in participants of the Whitehall II study aged between 51 - 71 years, using data from questionnaires participants have completed biennially since 1985 when the study began. We examine the possibility of two distinct forms of attrition [...] non-response and formally requesting to withdraw [...] and whether they have different predictors. Potential predictors were age, gender, marital status, occupational grade, retirement, home ownership, presence of longstanding illness, SF- 36 quality of life scores, social participation and educational level comparing participants and those who had withdrawn from the study. RESULTS: The two forms of attrition share many predictors and are associated but remain distinct. Being older, male, having a lower job grade, not being a home owner, not having a long standing illness, having higher levels of education, and not having retired, were all associated with a greater probability of non-response; being married was associated with higher probability in women and lower in men.

40|$|Objective: To examine socio-demographic {{and psychosocial}} moderators, and self-efficacy as a {{mediator}} of the cross-sectional relationships between having access to recreational facilities and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA); to investigate {{the extent to which}} the environment-LTPA associations could be explained by self-selection to neighborhoods. Design: A two-stage stratified sampling design was used to recruit 2, 650 adults (aged 20 - 65) from 32 urban communities varying in walkability and <b>socio-economic</b> status. <b>Participants</b> reported perceived access to facilities and home equipment for LTPA, weekly minutes of LTPA, self-efficacy for and enjoyment of LTPA, reasons for neighborhood selection, and socio-demographic characteristics. Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported recreational walking and other forms of moderate-to-vigorous LTPA expressed in MET-minutes. Results: Specific types of recreational facilities were independently associated with LTPA. Age, education, being overweight/obese, reasons for neighborhood selection, enjoyment of, and self-efficacy for LTPA moderated these relationships. Self-efficacy was not a significant mediator of these cross-sectional associations. Conclusion: These findings have potentially significant implications for the planning of environmental interventions aimed at increasing population-level LTPA particularly in those who are less attitudinally inclined to being physically active. © 2008 American Psychological Association. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|There may be minor {{variations}} between {{online and}} print versions (e. g. typographical {{error in the}} sub-title). This study compared the sexuality of male-to-female transsexuals (TS) with other (biological) females. From its beginnings in the early 20 th century, {{there has been a}} tradition of categorising TS into different types based on their sexual orientation. However, among the TS community there is mixed reaction to being categorised. Most especially, there has been debate over a theory proposed by Blanchard (1989 b) that categorises TS as either sexually attracted to males or sexually attracted to themselves as women (autogynephilic). To resolve some of this debate, this research measured a number of aspects of sexuality among TS and biological females: sexual orientation, childhood gender identity, autogynephilia, fetishism, masochism, sexual attraction to themes found in erotic transgender fiction, and aspects of sexuality that are relevant to evolutionary theory. These variables were measured on an online or paper questionnaire completed by 209 TS and 127 biological females. The results showed that TS tended to prefer younger sexual partners, and have lower levels of masochism than biological females. For the remainder of the sexuality variables measured, TS and biological females did not differ, with the exception of those TS who acknowledged a history of autogynephilia. These TS scored significantly higher on measures of autogynephilia, Attraction to Femininity in Males, Attraction to Transgender Fiction, Interest in Visual Sexual Stimuli, and Importance of Partner’s Physical Attractiveness. Factor analysis of the scale totals revealed four factors, with autogynephilia accounting for about 12 % of the questionnaire variance in scores. Autogynephilia was reported by 47 % of TS participants; however it manifested in a less predictable way than was proposed by Blanchard (1989 b). A further finding was the tendency of participants to report sexual arousal to a diverse range of sexual stimuli that were considered to be not conforming to cultural norms; this accounted for a large amount of the questionnaire variance (56. 44 %). Implications of these results were put forward in the discussion: clinicians are warned against restricting TS by categorising them; instead they should allow for the diversity and complexity of individual cases. An alternative theory of the development of cross-gender identity in biological males is proposed: this theory is based on the early development of a cross-gender identity and whether defense mechanisms are used to suppress this identity. In concluding, the limitations and suggestions for further research are discussed. A major limitation of this research is the large proportion of highly educated, higher <b>socio-economic</b> <b>participants...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: Work stress {{contributes}} to risk of {{coronary heart disease}} and hypertension. This study tested the influence of job control on ambulatory blood pressure, and ratings of perceived stress and happiness in men and women systematically sampled by socio-economic status from the Whitehall II epidemiological cohort. Participants: A total of 227 men and women aged 47 - 59 years sampled from higher, intermediate and lower employment grades. Outcome measures: Ambulatory blood pressure and ratings of stress, perceived control and happiness. Methods: Participants completed standard measures of job demands and job control, and undertook ambulatory monitoring with measures of blood pressure and subjective state every 20 min from early in the working day until going to bed. Results: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were greater in participants reporting low rather than high job control (means 125. 7 / 81. 5 versus 122. 4 / 78. 6 mmHg, P < 0. 05), independently of gender, employment grade, body mass index, age, smoking status, and physical activity. Differences persisted into the evening after work. Job demands and job strain (high demand/low control) were not associated with blood pressure. Participants reporting low job control experienced stress more frequently over the working day than did those with high job control. Higher <b>socio-economic</b> status <b>participants</b> and women were more stressed by low job control than were men and people of lower socio-economic status.

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{examine the}} {{feasibility}} of telephone-assisted placement of air nicotine monitors among low <b>socio-economic</b> intervention <b>participants,</b> and examine {{the use of this}} strategy in differentiating air nicotine concentrations in rooms where smoking is allowed from rooms where smoking is not allowed. MethodsForty participants were recruited from a county health department clinic and were enrolled in a brief smoke-free home policy intervention study. Twenty participants were selected at random for air nicotine monitor placement, and were instructed to telephone study staff who assisted them in monitor placement in their homes {{at the end of the}} intervention. Assessments were conducted at Weeks 0 and 8, with air nicotine assessment performed post-test. ResultsOf the 20 participants, 17 placed and returned the air nicotine monitors, and 16 also completed the follow-up survey. Follow-up survey data were not obtained on one monitor, and one participant who did not return the monitor completed the follow-up survey. Among those who reported a smoke-free policy (n= 7), the average nicotine concentration was 0. 62 /m 3 [standard deviation (SD) 0. 48]. Among those without a smoke-free policy (n= 9), the average nicotine concentration was 2. 30 /m 3 (SD 2. 04). Thus, the air nicotine concentration was significantly higher in those rooms where smoking was allowed [t(9, 11) =- 2. 39, P= 0. 04]. ConclusionsThe use of a telephone-assisted protocol for placement of air nicotine monitors was feasible. Despite the variability of air nicotine concentrations in rooms where smoking is allowed compared with rooms where smoking is not allowed, average concentrations were lower in smoke-free rooms. 5 U 48 DP 001909 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United StatesU 01 CA 154282 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesU 01 CA 154282 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States 2014 - 04 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 23480954 PMC 364058...|$|R

Design the study comprises the first stage of an action-research project. The first stage of research sought to explore the experiences of mothers and fathers in the early postnatal period by conducting a questionnaire within 4 weeks of the birth of their baby. The data obtained from the questionnaire is to inform an action-research group for stage two of the project. Setting The Children, Youth and Women's Health Service, a large city maternity hospital in South Australia, covering a range of <b>socio-economic</b> strata. <b>Participants</b> 85 parents completed and returned the questionnaire, comprising 52 mothers and 33 fathers. Measurement an anonymous self-report questionnaire was purpose designed to provide each parent with an opportunity to reflect on their own experience, with particular emphasis given to the provision of education and support during the early postnatal period. Findings a number of themes emerged, including a window of opportunity during the postnatal hospital stay to provide education and support, despite the reduction in the length of stay; the need for a family-centred approach to maternity services; and the significance of self and social network in the early transition to parenthood. Conclusions The findings from this stage of the research, combined with a review of the literature, provide insight that will contribute to stage two of the study. At this stage, an action-research group will continue planning to develop specific actions to enhance the provision of education to parents in the early postnatal period.

40|$|Purpose: A {{pilot study}} to {{identify}} the predictors of improvement in emotional and behavioural functioning of siblings of {{children with special needs}} following participation in SibworkS, a six-week manual-based, cognitive–behavioural group programme. Method: Data from 36 participants from a recent evaluation of the SibworkS programme was used. Measures were administered pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and three months post-intervention. Treatment effects were measured using change scores for siblings on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire – Parent Version (SDQ). Seven predictors were analysed: symptom severity of the child with special needs, participant age and gender, sibling birth order, family <b>socio-economic</b> status, <b>participant</b> baseline SDQ score and participant use of additional support services. Results: The overall model significantly predicted change in SDQ scores at post-intervention and follow-up (adjusted R 2 = 0. 41 and 0. 40). At both evaluation points, SDQ change scores were significantly predicted by baseline SDQ score. Furthermore, symptom severity of the child with special needs was a significant predictor at three months post-intervention. Conclusions: Poorer emotional and behavioural functioning among participants and symptom severity of the child with special needs were associated with greater intervention effects. These results indicate that SibworkS is likely to be beneficial for siblings who have difficulties adjusting, and siblings of children with more severe special needs. Implications for Rehabilitation Siblings of children with disability are at increased risk of emotional and behavioural difficulties. Sibworks is a manualised group-based intervention for the siblings of children with a disability. Poorer emotional and behavioural functioning among participants and symptom severity of the child with special needs were associated with greater intervention effects.

Riyadh region of Saudi Arabia rank first in camel production. The number of camels {{in the study area}} is estimated at 100, 436 heads representing 34 % {{of the total number of}} camels in the Saudi Arabia. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained by three methods: Interview schedules were distributed to all ordinary and racing camel owners in the study area regarding their <b>socio-economic</b> characteristics. <b>Participant</b> observation was conducted and life histories were taken also. The quantitative data were analysed using descriptive (frequency and percentage) and inferential (chi-square) statistics. The findings revealed that camel owners enjoy their way of life and will not give it up unless compelled to do so. Although camels are their wealth, they are mostly reluctant to sell them. The camel is still a symbol of status and prestige, even in the era of automobile and pickup truck, because Saudi Arabia is a simple and traditional society and many Bedouins still conserve their traditions and old customs, even though they adopt a modern life-style in cities. The main problems facing camel owners were, for ordinary camel owners, the high price of fodder; and for racing camel owners, the shortage of camel riders. Thus, the former group perceived reducing fodder prices as the highest priority in order to improve and develop their society, while for racing camel owners, the main need expressed was for encouragement and support from the government. Certainly, as longs as the camel is able to play an important social role in the daily life of so many varied people, it will continue to flourish as a valued domesticated animal.

40|$|To {{develop and}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a parental support programme to promote healthy dietary and physical activity habits and to prevent overweight and obesity in Swedish children. A cluster-randomised controlled trial was carried out in areas with low to medium <b>socio-economic</b> status. <b>Participants</b> were six-year-old children (n = 243) and their parents. Fourteen pre-school classes were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 7) and control groups (n = 7). The intervention lasted for 6 months and included: 1) Health information for parents, 2) Motivational Interviewing with parents and 3) Teacher-led classroom activities with children. Physical activity was measured by accelerometry, dietary and physical activity habits and parental self-efficacy through a questionnaire. Body weight and height were measured and BMI standard deviation score was calculated. Measurements were conducted at baseline, post-intervention and at 6 -months follow-up. Group differences were examined using analysis of covariance and Poisson regression, adjusted for gender and baseline values. There was no significant intervention effect in the primary outcome physical activity. Sub-group analyses showed a significant gender-group interaction in total physical activity (TPA), with girls in the intervention group demonstrating higher TPA during weekends (p = 0. 04), as well as in sedentary time, with boys showing more sedentary time in the intervention group (p = 0. 03). There was a significantly higher vegetable intake (0. 26 servings) in the intervention group compared to the control group (p = 0. 003). At follow-up, sub-group analyses showed a sustained effect for boys. The intervention did not affect the prevalence of overweight or obesity. It is possible to influence vegetable intake in children and girls' physical activity through a parental support programme. The programme needs to be intensified in order to increase effectiveness and sustain the effects long-term.

30|$|In {{designing}} {{incentives for}} mobile crowdsensing applications, {{an important factor}} that is often ignored is term. Term, otherwise referred to as shelf life, is the period for which the crowdsensing initiative is intended to last [80]. Some crowdsensing applications, {{by virtue of the}} purpose they serve are only active seasonally, e.g., the PetaJakarta system used during the monsoon seasons for crowdsensing flood conditions in Jakarta [81]. Other crowdsensing applications may operate in short term, e.g., a one-off initiative, sometimes lasting just few hours [82] or long term basis [64, 83]. Sun [84] and Sun et al. [85] noted {{that it is important to}} consider the term when designing profitable and sustainable incentive mechanisms for mobile crowdsensing. The incentive mechanisms to keep participants in the crowdsensing loop on long-term basis are more complicated than those required for short term sensing activities [64]. For example, in long-term or ongoing sensing campaigns, users may find the sensing tasks repetitive and boring over time. Incentives may become undervalued or inadequate as a result of significant improvement to the <b>socio-economic</b> conditions of <b>participants.</b> In addition, Salim and Haque [86] noted that when participation in mobile crowdsensing is required for a long term, incentives are considered to be highly relevant compared to when it is for short term.|$|R

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyse the associations between socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics and the uptake of testing. results Knowledge of serostatus ranged from 2. 2 % among women in Guinea (2005) to 27. 4 % among women in Rwanda (2005). Despite varied levels of testing, univariate analysis showed the profile of testers to be remarkably similar across countries, with respect to socio-demographic characteristics such as area of residence and <b>socio-economic</b> status. HIV-positive <b>participants</b> {{were more likely to have}} tested and received their results than HIV-negative participants, with the exception of women in Senegal and men in Guinea. Adjusted analyses indicate that a secondary or higher level of education was a key determinant of testing, and awareness that treatment exists was independently positively associated with testing, once other characteristics were taken into account. conclusion This work provides a baseline for monitoring trends in testing and exploring changes in the profile of those who get tested after the introduction and scale-up of treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the association between epilepsy self-management and disease control and <b>socio-economic</b> status. Study <b>participants</b> were adult patients at two epilepsy specialty clinics in Houston, Texas that serve demographically and socioeconomically diverse populations. Self-management behaviors- medication, information, safety, seizure, and lifestyle management were tested against emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and seizure occurrence. Overall self-management score was associated with a greater likelihood of hospitalizations over a prior twelve month time frame, but not for three months, and was not associated with seizure occurrence or emergency room visits, at all. Scores on specific self-management behaviors varied in their relationships to the different disease control indicators, over time. Contrary to expectations based on the findings of previous research, higher information management scores were associated with greater likelihood of emergency room visits and hospitalizations, over the study 2 ̆ 7 s twelve months. Higher lifestyle management scores were associated with lower likelihood of any emergency room visits, over the preceding twelve months and emergency room visits for the last three months. The positive associations between overall self-management scores and information management behaviors and disease control are contrary to published research. These findings may indicate that those with worse disease control in a prior period employ stronger self-management efforts to better control their epilepsy. Further research is needed to investigate this hypothesis. ...|$|R
40|$|Various {{government}} agencies are increasingly wishing {{to know more}} about the reasons why people participate in sport and recreational physical activity. Reliable information on these- the motivators and the barriers- can be difficult to measure across the population as a whole however one way of understanding the nature of participation is to first identify the characteristics of target groups with various levels of participation. The Australian Bureau of Statistics conducted the first General Social Survey in 2002 to collect a range of information that could be used as indicators of social capital and well-being. At the same time the survey asked about participation in sport and physical activities. The resulting data provides a unique opportunity to examine the relationships between a range of social indicators and participation in sport and physical activity. Through a multivariate logistic regression model, we quantify a number of associations between participation in sport, the <b>socio-economic</b> characteristics of <b>participants</b> and several other social indicators. The model estimates the likelihood of participation given the explanatory variables and so enables those with low levels of participation to be better defined. This in turn enables the development and targeting of policies aimed at increasing participation in sport and related physical activities.

40|$|Abstract Background Along {{with reduced}} levels of {{physical}} activity, older Australian's mean energy consumption has increased. Now over 60 % of older Australians are considered overweight or obese. This study aims to confirm if a low-cost, accessible {{physical activity and}} nutrition program can improve levels of physical activity and diet of insufficiently active 60 - 70 year-olds. Methods/Design This 12 -month home-based randomised controlled trial (RCT) will consist of a nutrition and physical activity intervention for insufficiently active people aged 60 to 70 years from low to medium <b>socio-economic</b> areas. Six-hundred <b>participants</b> will be recruited from the Australian Federal Electoral Role and randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 300) and control (n = 300) groups. The study {{is based on the}} Social Cognitive Theory and Precede-Proceed Model, incorporating voluntary cooperation and self-efficacy. The intervention includes a specially designed booklet that provides participants with information and encourages dietary and physical activity goal setting. The booklet will be supported by an exercise chart, calendar, bi-monthly newsletters, resistance bands and pedometers, along with phone and email contact. Data will be collected over three time points: pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and 6 -months post-study. Discussion This trial will provide valuable information for community-based strategies to improve older adults' physical activity and dietary intake. The project will provide guidelines for appropriate sample recruitment, and the development, implementation and evaluation of a minimal intervention program, as well as information on minimising barriers to participation in similar programs.

40|$|Magister Artium (Social Work) - MA(SW) Early {{childhood}} {{development has}} been recognised {{to be the most}} important contributor to long-term social and emotional development. Whatever occurs in a child‘s life in the early years may be an indicator of the child‘s developmental trajectory and life-course. Therefore positive parenting is paramount to foster quality parent-child interaction. However, previous research shows that for parents to adopt a positive parenting style, some degree of parental knowledge is required. The aim of this study was to compare the relationship between knowledge of child development and parenting styles in low and high socio-economic groups of parents in early childhood development centres. The study used a mixed methods approach with a two-phased sequential exploratory design. A systematic review was conducted in phase 1 followed by a quantitative study for phase 2. The sample consisted of N = 140 parents with children between 2 - 5 years old from low and high <b>socio-economic</b> groups. The <b>participants</b> completed the Knowledge of Infant Development Inventory (KIDI-P) and Parenting Styles Dimension Questionnaire (PSDQ). Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation were used to analyze the data. Findings of the study show that the authoritative parenting style is the prevalent parenting style in both low and high socio-economic groups. Furthermore the results indicate that parents are fairly knowledgeable across all subscales for both the low and high socio-economic group with a significant difference in degree of knowledge with the high socio-economic group being more knowledgeable than the low socio-economic group. The findings also show that there in no correlation between knowledge of child development and authoritative parenting styles. However correlations do exist between the other variables...|$|R
40|$|Magister Social Work -MSWTeenage {{parenting}} is recognised {{as one of}} the greatest health and social problems in South Africa. Research in South Africa has shown that by the age of 18 years, more than 30 % of teens have given birth at least once. Teen mothers may feel disempowered because they are ‘othered’ and consequently, may develop forms of resistance which in most cases may inhibit their ability to parent. Social support is therefore, an imperative intervention for successful teen parenting. Bronfenbrenner’s bio-ecological systems theory proposes that social support could be considered to reside within the microsystem of the model if the developing person is the teen mother. The aim of this study was to compare social support of different family forms and establish whether a relationship between single teen mothers’ parental efficacy and social support exists across the different family forms. This study used a quantitative methodology with a cross-sectional comparative correlation design. The sample consisted of N = 160 single teen mothers who reside with her family for a period of one year or is currently residing with her family or members thereof, in low <b>socio-economic</b> communities. The <b>participants</b> completed a self-report questionnaire that comprised of the Social Provisions Scale (SPS), and the Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC) scale. Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation were used to investigate the data. Outcomes of the study indicated that a significant positive relationship between social support and parental efficacy existed. These findings are important for planning and applying parenting programmes amongst single teen mothers and facilitating awareness regarding the importance of social support and family forms when considering parenting practices...|$|R
40|$|Background : {{bullying}} (and cyberbullying) is {{a widespread}} phenomenon among young people and {{it is used to}} describe interpersonal relationships characterized by an imbalance of power. In this relationships often show aggressive behavior and intentional "harm doing" repeated over time. The prevalence of bullying among youth has been reported to vary widely among countries (5. 1 %- 41. 4 %) and this behavior seems generally higher among student boys than girls. Several school interventions have been developed to reduce bullying, but reported inconsistent results possibly related to limitations in the study design or to other methodological shortcomings. Aims : evaluating randomized-controlled trials (RTCs) conducted between 2000 and 2013 to assess the effectiveness of school interventions on bullying and cyberbullying. Methods : a systematic search of the scientific literature was conducted on Pubmed/Medline and Ebsco online databases. We also contacted experts in the field of preventive bullying research. Results : 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies did not show positive effects in the long term; the interventions focused on the whole school were more effective in reducing bullying than interventions delivered through classroom curricula or social skills training alone. Conclusion : while there is evidence that programs aimed at reducing bullying can be effective in the short term, their long-term effectiveness has not been established, and there are important differences in the results based on gender, age and <b>socio-economic</b> status of <b>participants.</b> Internal inconsistency in the findings of some studies, together with the wide variability of experimental designs and lack of common standardized measures in outcome evaluation, are important limitations in this field of research...|$|R
40|$|The need {{to develop}} our {{understanding}} of public perceptions of roles and responsibilities for health underpins {{a number of key}} policy developments in the UK (Wanless, 2004; Welsh Assembly Government, 2003), particularly in light of an increased focus on the relationship {{between the state and the}} individual in health improvement action (Halpern, 2003). Research was commissioned by the Welsh Assembly Government to explore perceptions of responsibility at different levels including individual, organisational and state roles and responsibilities for health improvement amongst the general public and key stake holders. This report focuses on the focus group study with member of the general public across Wales in 2005. Participants (n = 101) included a range of age groups and family backgrounds, with 57 % female. A broad range of socio-economic backgrounds were represented. A semi structured schedule, newspaper headline prompts and a prioritisation task were used to guide the discussion. Group discussions were audio taped and transcriptions were analysed with main themes identified and validated by a second researcher. Areas of consent and disagreement within groups were identified and key areas of similarity and difference between <b>socio-economic</b> groups identified. <b>Participant’s</b> understandings of personal responsibility for health were associated with socio-economic position and, to a lesser extent, with age. Issues associated with health communication, family processes, social capital, instrumentation, individualisation, social values and personal morality were used to explain and justify health protective and risk behaviours. The tension between what were seen as the responsibilities of the state and maintaining personal freedoms highlighted further differences between these groups. These results raise a number of implications for public health practice, with lay perceptions reflecting current policy debates...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to explore activism, attitudes, and imagery {{connecting}} Black churchgoers in Miami, Florida and the natural environment. The research approach was qualitative, began as exploratory research, and used the techniques of snowball sampling, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews. Three case studies representing various <b>socio-economic</b> levels, denominations, <b>participant</b> education levels, and environmental facets were chosen for in-depth ethnographic research. There are three major findings in the research. First, there is {{a link between the}} preservation of Black history and the preservation of the environment among Black churchgoers, who feel strong connections to a sense of place, rural life, and the past. However their work is strongly directed to bring about benefits for people and the environment in the present and the future. Second, public access to public lands is a basic and important right espoused by these Black churchgoing activists. Third, the vocabulary used by Black churchgoing activists regarding the natural environment differs from today 2 ̆ 7 s “mainstream” environmentalists. The concept of “beauty” is pivotal to Black appreciation of and activism toward the environment and is reminiscent of the early environmental protection movement in the United States and conservationists such as John Muir. These findings concerning how Black spirituality relates to the environment adds to the sparse literature on the subject, and provides for potential linkages between Blacks and “mainstream” environmental groups to benefit both parties. An understanding of the connections between Black spirituality and perceptions of the environment should facilitate the development of better programs to improve and protect the environment. Environmental projects may also address the social and economic needs of Black communities, churches, and congregations, as well as the ecosystem. ...|$|R
40|$|Children {{who were}} born prematurely (before 37 weeks’ gestation) {{are at greater risk}} for a range of {{impairments}} in cognitive, motor, social-emotional, and academic functioning (e. g., Bos et al., 2013). Other developmental disorders, such as language delays and deficits, are also more common in preterm children (Van Noort et al., 2012). Because language function is essential in all kinds of social and academic life (Young et al., 2002), it is crucial to better identify and characterize language impairment in preterm-born children. Despite the large amount of research conducted on language abilities in preterm children, little is known about their phonological development (Barre et al., 2011). In the present study, we investigated differences in several phonological tasks between French-speaking premature children and in term-born control children. 30 children born at < 35 weeks’ gestation (4 to 5 years old) and with low-birth weight (1215 g on mean) were recruited. These preterm children were matched to 30 children born at term on gender, chronological age and <b>socio-economic</b> level. All <b>participants</b> were administered five language tasks (phonemic discrimination, phonological judgment, pictures naming, pseudo-words repetition and phonological awareness) in order to precisely assess their phonological skills. Results indicated that preterm children presented poorer performance than control term-born children when they had to discriminate between different phonemes (phonemic discrimination abilities), to detect phonemic modifications (phonological judgment) and to recognize and identify syllabic segments (phonological awareness). Differences between both groups have also been observed in the quality of phonological representations (pictures naming task). However, both groups of children performed equally well in the pseudo-words repetition task. These findings revealed that preterm children score significantly lower compared with term-born children on several phonological tests, a language subdomain which is particularly important in the initial stages of language development and for reading.

40|$|C 1 - Journal Articles RefereedOBJECTIVES: Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is the commonest {{sexually transmitted}} infection. Despite the significant {{morbidity and mortality}} associated with HPV-related diseases, previous studies have demonstrated low HPV knowledge in the general population. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess knowledge of cervical cancer and HPV among young women and investigate predictors of high knowledge. METHODS: Female subjects, aged 16 - 25 years living in Victoria, Australia, were recruited using targeted advertising on Facebook from May to September 2010. A web-based questionnaire was used in a cross-sectional pilot study for a large longitudinal study on women's health, The Young Female Health Initiative. RESULTS: A total of 278 women completed the questionnaire. The geographic region, indigenous status and <b>socio-economic</b> status of <b>participants</b> were representative of the target population. Overall, 63 % knew what HPV was, but only 48 % knew it was a common virus. Predictors of high HPV knowledge on multivariate analyses were older age (adjusted OR (aOR) 2. 78, 95 % CI 0. 77 to 10. 04), higher socio-economic status (aOR 1. 39, 95 % CI 0. 66 to 2. 95), being Australian-born (aOR 3. 10, 95 % CI 1. 15 to 8. 36), older age at first vaginal intercourse (aOR 1. 84, 95 % CI 0. 66 to 5. 14), awareness of HPV vaccines (aOR 2. 16, 95 % CI 0. 68 to 6. 85) and chlamydia (aOR 2. 57, 95 % CI 1. 11 to 5. 94), and self-reported HPV vaccination status (aOR 1. 83, 95 % CI 0. 76 to 4. 41). CONCLUSIONS: HPV and cervical cancer knowledge among participants were relatively high compared with other studies conducted both worldwide and in Australia.

40|$|Systemic {{bacterial}} {{infections are}} {{a major cause of}} paediatric febrile illness in sub-Saharan Africa. Aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of social and geographical determinants on the risk of bacteraemia in a rural-urban transition zone in Ghana. Children below 15 years of age with fever were recruited at an outpatient department in the suburban belt of Kumasi, Ghana's second largest city. Blood was taken for bacterial culture and malaria diagnostics. The <b>socio-economic</b> status of <b>participants</b> was calculated using Principle Component Analysis. A scale, based on key urban characteristics, was established to quantify urbanicity for all communities in the hospital catchment area. A case-control analysis was conducted, where children with and without bacteraemia were cases and controls, respectively. Bacteraemia was detected in 72 (3. 1 %) of 2, 306 hospital visits. Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS; n = 24; 33. 3 %) and Salmonella typhi (n = 18; 25. 0 %) were the most common isolates. Logistic regression analysis showed that bacteraemia was negatively associated with urbanicity (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 8; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 7 - 1. 0) and socio-economic status (OR = 0. 8; 95 % CI: 0. 6 - 0. 9). Both associations were stronger if only NTS infections were used as cases (OR = 0. 5; 95 % CI: 0. 3 - 0. 8 and OR = 0. 6; 95 % CI: 0. 4 - 1. 0, respectively). The results of this study highlight the importance of individual as well as community factors as independent risk factors for invasive bacterial infection (IBI) and especially NTS.
