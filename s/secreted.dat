40|$|Immunoglobulin <b>secreting</b> {{cells were}} quantitated in the {{bronchial}} lavage fluids of 12 normal volunteers and compared with immunoglobulin <b>secreting</b> cells in peripheral blood, by a reverse hemolytic plaque assay. The {{mean number of}} cells <b>secreting</b> immunoglobulin (Ig) G in bronchial lavage fluids was 489 per million lymphocytes vs. a mean of 175 IgG <b>secreting</b> cells per million lymphocytes in peripheral blood (P < 0. 02). The mean number of IgA <b>secreting</b> cells in bronchial lavage fluids was 633 per million lymphocytes as compared to 100 per million lymphocytes in peripheral blood (P < 0. 005). Thus, compared to peripheral blood, cells from the lavage fluids were relatively enriched for both IgG and IgA <b>secreting</b> cells. However, IgA <b>secreting</b> cells were the major class of immunoglobulin <b>secreting</b> cells in bronchial lavage fluids, whereas IgG <b>secreting</b> cells predominated in peripheral blood. The prominence of IgA <b>secreting</b> cells in bronchial lavage fluids was further demonstrated by a mean ratio of IgA/IgG <b>secreting</b> cells in bronchial lavage fluids of 1. 26 compared to a ratio in peripheral blood of 0. 57 (P < 0. 02). Cells <b>secreting</b> IgM were identified in only four of seven bronchial lavage fluid samples studied but in all peripheral blood samples. IgE <b>secreting</b> cells were not present in normal peripheral blood but could be demonstrated in 5 of 11 lavage fluid specimens. Thus, cells actively <b>secreting</b> immunoglobulins can be identified in the lower bronchial-alveolar tree of normal human subjects. Cells <b>secreting</b> IgG, IgA, or IgM may function in local lung defenses against infection; cells <b>secreting</b> IgE may contribute to hypersensitivity reactions in the lung...|$|R
40|$|Islet cells tumours are a {{range of}} rare {{neoplasms}} of neuroendocrine origin arising in or close to the pancreas. The normal islet cells of Langerhans in the pancreas contain B-cells (which <b>secrete</b> insulin), A-cells (which <b>secrete</b> glucagon), D-cells (which <b>secrete</b> somatostatin), D 1 -cells (which <b>secrete</b> pancreatic polypeptide) and D 2 -cells (which <b>secrete</b> vasoactive intestinal peptide). The majority (85 %) of islet cell tumours <b>secrete</b> {{one or more of}} these hormones, or other substances not normally found in the adult pancreas (although often present in the foetal pancreas), notably gastrin...|$|R
25|$|Approximately 3 million cell {{clusters}} called pancreatic islets {{are present}} in the pancreas. Within these islets are four main types of cells which are involved in the regulation of blood glucose levels. Each type of cell <b>secretes</b> a different type of hormone: α alpha cells <b>secrete</b> glucagon (increase glucose in blood), β beta cells <b>secrete</b> insulin (decrease glucose in blood), δ delta cells <b>secrete</b> somatostatin (regulates/stops α and β cells) and PP cells, or γ (gamma) cells, <b>secrete</b> pancreatic polypeptide. These act to control blood glucose through <b>secreting</b> glucagon to increase the levels of glucose, and insulin to decrease it.|$|R

40|$|Mice were {{injected}} {{in their}} hind footpads with peroxidase (PO) emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant. The development of cells <b>secreting</b> anti-peroxidase antibody (Ab) and cells <b>secreting</b> immunoglobulins (Ig) were {{detected in the}} draining popliteal lymph nodes in the subsequent 35 days, using local haemolysis plaque assay with sheep red cell blood cells coated with either PO or anti-mouse Ig antibody. Plaque-forming cells (PFC) were isolated from the centre of plaques by micromanipulation and after appropriate treatment, were examined by electron microscopy for their intracellular Ab content and in corporation of [3 H]-thymidine. Four subpopulations of Ig <b>secreting</b> cells were distinguished: (1) cells <b>secreting</b> Ig without Ab function and not containing intracellular Ab detectable between days 5 and 20; (2) cells <b>secreting</b> Ig without Ab function but containing Ab appearing on day 6 and present throughout the immune response; (3) cells <b>secreting</b> Ab and containing Ab; (4) cells <b>secreting</b> Ab, but without detectable intracellular Ab. These last subpopulations appeared on day 7 and were found in all subsequent assays. The analysis of the kinetics of these subpopulations suggest that cells <b>secreting</b> Ig without Ab function might be precursors of Ab <b>secreting</b> cells...|$|R
50|$|Many {{human cell}} types {{have the ability}} to be {{secretory}} cells. They have a well-developed endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus to fulfill their function. Tissues in humans that produce secretions include the gastrointestinal tract which <b>secretes</b> digestive enzymes and gastric acid, the lung which <b>secretes</b> surfactants, and sebaceous glands which <b>secrete</b> sebum to lubricate the skin and hair. Meibomian glands in the eyelid <b>secrete</b> sebum to lubricate and protect the eye.|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of appearance}} of cells <b>secreting</b> IgG rheumatoid factor (IgG RF) {{has been studied}} in MRL/l mice {{by means of the}} ELISPOT assay, a new immunoenzyme procedure. Mice of the MRL/l strain spontaneously develop an autoimmune disease associated with arthritic manifestations. IgG RF <b>secreting</b> splenocytes were first detected at the clinical onset of the disease at the age of 3 months. Peak frequencies of IgG RF <b>secreting</b> cells amounting to almost 10 % {{of the total number of}} IgG <b>secreting</b> cells were observed at later stages. The appearance of IgG RF <b>secreting</b> cells was preceded by at least 1 month by elevated levels of circulating immune complexes and abnormally high numbers of IgG <b>secreting</b> cells. The frequencies of IgG RF <b>secreting</b> cells and of IgG <b>secreting</b> splenocytes did not follow each other at least not during the first 3 months preceding the onset of clinical disease. The data presented suggest that IgG RF production in MRL/l mice is not triggered as part of an early stage of polyclonal activation but could be induced by IgG containing immune complexes...|$|R
5|$|TRH is <b>secreted</b> at an {{increased}} rate in situations such as cold exposure {{in order to}} stimulate thermogenesis. In addition to being suppressed {{by the presence of}} thyroid hormones, TSH production is blunted by dopamine, somatostatin, and glucocorticoids.|$|E
5|$|The {{exoskeleton}} of {{the abdomen}} {{is divided into}} plates called dorsal tergites and ventral sternites. Wax is <b>secreted</b> from glands on the abdomen and extruded between the sternites where it resembles flakes of dandruff. It is <b>secreted</b> by the queen when she starts a nest and by young workers. It is scraped from the abdomen by the legs, moulded until malleable and used {{in the construction of}} honeypots, to cover the eggs, to line empty cocoons for use as storage containers and sometimes to cover the exterior of the nest.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{molecular}} cues involved in the correct targeting of the migrating precursors remains a question. The secretion of a chemoattractant factor by the OB appears as a possibility. Chemoattractants and repellants act on the migrating neurons by inducing changes in the growth cone to direct them. Nevertheless, tissue derived from this structure had no directive influence on the migration. On the other hand, a septum-derived <b>secreted</b> factor showed a repulsive effect on the SVZ cells. More recently, {{it has been shown}} that the <b>secreted</b> molecule SLIT shows such a repelling effect on SVZ-derived precursors. Furthermore, integrins have been demonstrated to have a regulatory influence on precursor cell chain-migration and regulation of their divisions.|$|E
50|$|They {{give rise}} to both the {{endocrine}} and exocrine cells. Exocrine cells constitute the acinar cells and the ductal cells.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cimetidine}} on the healing and recurrence of duodenal ulcers and gastric ulcers were compared. The {{extent of the}} acid <b>secreting</b> areas was examined by the endoscopic Congo red methylene blue test. Using the extent of acid <b>secreting</b> areas gastric ulcers were classified into ulcers with and without extensive acid <b>secreting</b> areas. Duodenal ulcers were all associated with extensive acid <b>secreting</b> areas. The gastric acid outputs in the basal state and after maximal stimulation with gastrin were highest in duodenal ulcers, and lowest in gastric ulcers without extensive acid <b>secreting</b> areas. Cimetidine treatment significantly promoted the healing of duodenal ulcers and gastric ulcers with extensive acid <b>secreting</b> areas when compared with placebo, but not of the gastric ulcers without extensive acid <b>secreting</b> areas. Cimetidine also significantly diminished the recurrence of duodenal ulcers, but not gastric ulcers with and without extensive acid <b>secreting</b> areas. These findings indicate that in Japan cimetidine promotes the healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers associated with high gastric acid production and prevents recurrence of duodenal ulcers, but {{has little or no}} influence on the healing and recurrence of gastric ulcers associated with low acid secretion...|$|R
50|$|The {{apocrine gland}} <b>secretes</b> an oily fluid with proteins, lipids, and steroids that is odorless before {{microbial}} activity.

Unlike eccrine sweat glands, which <b>secrete</b> continuously, the apocrine glands <b>secrete</b> in periodic spurts.|$|R
5|$|A {{sample of}} CSF {{can be taken}} via lumbar puncture. This can reveal the {{intracranial}} pressure, as well as indicate diseases including infections of the brain or its surrounding meninges.

5|$|Antibodies are <b>secreted</b> by B {{cells of}} the {{adaptive}} immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is <b>secreted</b> from the cell to be free in the blood plasma, and a membrane-bound form that {{is attached to the}} surface of a B cell and {{is referred to as the}} B-cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.|$|E
5|$|Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in phospholipid and cholesterol homeostasis. After binding ApoER2, ApoE is taken up into the cell and may remain in the intracellular space, be shipped to the cell surface, or be degraded. ApoE binding leads to the cleavage of ApoER2 into <b>secreted</b> proteins by the actions of the plasma membrane protein gamma secretase. ApoE may be the signalling ligand responsible for ApoER2's role in modulating the JNK signalling pathway.|$|E
