The results proved that, in the evaporation process, Na 2 Ok concentration should be controlled in 300 - 320 g/l to prevent Al(OH) 3 from precipitation. The additive amount of Na 2 SO 4 had a great influence on the precipitate of Na 2 CO 3, Na 2 SO 4 and Al(OH) 3. The precipitation rate increased with the increasing of Na 2 SO 4 content.

The combination of both treatments was optimized. The final percentage of effluent decolorization, the reduction of halogenated organic volatile compound and the total organic carbon removal were the determinant factors in the selection of the best treatment conditions. The optimized method was applied to the treatment of nine simulated dyeing effluents prepared with different reactive dyes in order to compare the behavior of mono, bi, and tri-reactive dyes.

40|$|This {{study is}} based on the {{electrochemical}} decolouration of exhausted dyeing effluents which contain dyes and salts. The treated effluents were reconstituted and reused in a new dyeing process. Initially, synthetic effluents containing one of the reactive dyes Novacron Yellow, Ruby and Deepnight were treated in the laboratory pilot. In all cases, the dye decolouration follows a pseudo-first order reaction. Subsequently, seven industrial effluents which contain mixtures of these dyes were collected in a Spanish mill and treated in the laboratory pilot. Two methods for the electrochemical treatment and further effluent reconstitution and reuse were studied. The first method consisted of an electrochemical treatment followed by an acidification and a stripping step to remove the carbonate ions. In the second method, the acidification was carried out before the electrochemical treatment; subsequently, the generated CO 2 was removed during the decolouration process. Finally, the optimised process was applied in situ in a Spanish mill by means of a semi-industrial pilot plant (400 L). No significant colour differences were appreciated between reference dyeings and the fabrics dyed with the treated exhausted effluents.

40|$|The ultimate, {{possibly}} geodynamic {{control and}} {{potential impact of}} changes in circulation activity and <b>salt</b> <b>discharge</b> of Mediterranean outflow waters (MOW) on Atlantic meridional overturning circulation have formed long-standing objectives in paleoceanography. Late Pliocene changes in the distal advection of MOW were reconstructed on orbital timescales for northeast Atlantic DSDP/ODP sites 548 and 982 off Brittany and on Rockall Plateau, supplemented by a proximal record from Site U 1389 west off Gibraltar, and compared to Western Mediterranean surface and deep-water records of Alboran Sea Site 978. From ~ 3. 43 to 3. 3 Ma, MOW temperatures and salinities form a prominent rise by 2 – 4 °C and ~ 3 psu, induced by a preceding and coeval rise in sea surface and deep-water salinity and increased summer aridity in the Mediterranean Sea. We speculate that these changes triggered an increased MOW flow and were ultimately induced by a persistent 2. 5 °C cooling of Indonesian Through-Flow waters. The temperature drop resulted from the northward drift of Australia that crossed a threshold value near 3. 6 – 3. 3 Ma {{and led to a}} large-scale cooling of the eastern subtropical Indian Ocean and in turn, to a reduction of African monsoon rains. Vice versa, we show that the distinct rise in Mediterranean salt export after ~ 3. 4 Ma induced a unique long-term rise in the formation of Upper North Atlantic Deep Water, that followed with a phase lag of ~ 100 ky.

40|$|Late Pliocene {{changes in}} the {{advection}} of Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) derivates were reconstructed at northeast Atlantic DSDP/ODP sites 548 and 982 and compared to records of WMDW at West Mediterranean Site 978. Neodymium isotope (epsilon-Nd) values more positive than ~ 10. 5 /~ 11 reflect diluted MOW derivates that spread almost continuously into the northeast Atlantic from 3. 7 to 2. 55 Ma, reaching Rockall Plateau Site 982 from 3. 63 to 2. 75 Ma. From 3. 4 to 3. 3 Ma average MOW temperature and salinity increased by 2 °- 4 °C and ~ 1 psu both at proximal Site 548 and distal Site 982. The rise implies a rise in flow strength, coeval with a long-term rise in both west Mediterranean Sea surface salinity by almost 2 psu and average bottom water salinity (BWS) by ~ 1 psu, despite inherent uncertainties in BWS estimates. The changes were linked with major Mediterranean aridification and a drop in African monsoon humidity. In contrast to model expectations, the rise in MOW <b>salt</b> <b>discharge</b> after 3. 4 Ma did not translate into improved ventilation of North Atlantic Deep Water, since it possibly {{was too small to}} significantly influence Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.

40|$|The Karun-Dez Basin is {{the largest}} river basin in Iran (approximately 62, 718 km 2). Situated in the {{southwest}} of Iran it is formed by the confluence of two major rivers, the Karun and Dez. Annual discharge of these rivers is 21, 693 m 3 /year. The river system provides the principal source of potable and industrial water in the region. The Karun/Dez basin has experienced a major salinity problem in recent years. Near the outlet of the catchment at the City of Khoramshahr, average salinity in 1970 was 1, 388 micromhos/cm and in 2001 average salinity was 3, 607 micromhos/cm. At {{the headwaters of the}} basin, at Dez dam, the average salinity in 2001 was 533 micromhos/cm. This increase in salinity has rendered the river unsuitable for potable use for much of the year, irrespective of general environmental effects. Use of water for irrigation has not only reduced dilution flows but also causes adjacent ground water levels to raise bringing salt to the surface and increasing <b>salt</b> <b>discharge</b> to the river. The impact of irrigation exacerbated by (naturally) saline tributaries and the reduction in flow from the high rates of diversion for irrigation, urban and industrial water supply. Salinity impacts on the surrounding environment of Karun-Dez Basin in a number of ways. One of these impacts is that the reproductive cycle for important fauna has become upset because low salinity water is not available at critical times. In addition more salt-intolerant species have been removed. Where trees have died the physical structure of the ecosystem has changed and the habitat for a range of flora and fauna has disappeared. There are impacts on local endemic species and threats to Ramsar listed wetlands such as the Shadegan wetland, which abuts the Karun River.

40|$|AbstractA {{recirculating}} aquaculture system (RAS) can minimize water use, allowing fish {{production in}} regions where water is scarce and also placing the waterborne wastes into a concentrated and relatively small volume of effluent. The RAS effluent generated during clarifier backwash is usually small in volume (possibly 0. 2 – 0. 5 % of the total recirculating flow when microscreen filters are used) but contains high levels of concentrated organic solids and nutrients. When a RAS is operated at high salinities for culture of marine species, recovering the saltwater contained in the backwash effluent could allow for its reuse within the RAS and also reduce <b>salt</b> <b>discharge</b> to the environment. Membrane biological reactors (MBRs) combine activated sludge type treatment with membrane filtration. Therefore, in addition to removing biodegradable organics, suspended solids, and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, MBRs retain high concentrations of microorganisms and, when operated with membrane pore sizes < 1 μm, exclude microorganisms from their discharge. In this research, an Enviroquip (Austin, TX) MBR pilot-plant was installed and evaluated over a range of salinities to determine its effectiveness at removing bacteria, turbidity, suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus and cBOD 5 content from the approximately 22 m 3 /day concentrated biosolids backwash flow discharged from the RASs at The Conservation Fund Freshwater Institute. The MBR system was managed at a hydraulic retention time of 40. 8 h, a solids retention time of 64 ± 8 days, resulting in a Food: Microorganism ratio of 0. 029 day− 1. Results indicated excellent removal efficiency (%) of TSS (99. 65 ± 0. 1 to 99. 98 ± 0. 01) and TVS (99. 96 ± 0. 01 to 99. 99 ± 0. 0) at all salinity levels. Similarly, a 3 – 4 log 10 removal of total heterotrophic microbes and total coliform was seen at all treatment conditions. Total nitrogen removal efficiency (%) ranged from 91. 8 ± 2. 9 to 95. 5 ± 0. 6 at the treatment levels and was consistent, provided a sufficient acclimation period to each new condition was given. Conversely, total phosphorus removal efficiencies (%) at 0 ppt, 8 ppt, 16 ppt and 32 ppt salinity were 96. 1 ± 1. 0, 72. 7 ± 3. 5, 70. 4 ± 2. 3, and 65. 2 ± 5. 4, respectively, indicating reduced phosphorus removal at higher salinities...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to the calculation of salt loads and salinity risk in floodplain landscapes of the Murray Basin in south-eastern Australia involves the integration of satellite imagery (SPOT 5 and LANDSAT), airborne electromagnetics, high resolution LiDAR digital elevation data, geomorphic, vegetation and geological mapping, and petrophysical attributes from laboratory analysis of field and borehole samples. Satellite imagery, validated by a field mapping program, was used to map surface salt and halophytic vegetation. AEM data, validated by drilling data, were used to produce maps of the key elements of the hydrogeological system including the thickness and extent of the main aquitards and aquifers and internal variations in lithology that {{could be related to}} significant variations in hydraulic conductivity. Calibration of hydrogeological parameters was accomplished using samples from a drilling program on the floodplains of the middle reaches of the Murray River. Pore fluids were collected from uncontaminated drill cores and analysed for total dissolved solutes. Other petrophysical attributes measured include lithology texture, porosity and permeability. These data are used to convert the electrical conductivity data to useable attributes such as water quality or tonnes per hectare salt. Previous studies have demonstrated that the causal relationship between apparent conductivity (ECa) and salt can be expressed as a linear function. The average conductivity in the material between surface and groundwater is used to produce a near-surface salt store map, and maps of water quality beneath the watertable. The average ECa is translated into total salt as tonnes per hectare. The spatial distribution of fine textured materials is then overlain onto the total salt image. On average, the bulk density of sediments is approximately 1. 6 g/cm 3 (or t/m 3). Because ArcGIS calculates the total-salt as voxels (i. e. 40 x 40 x 1 m 3), the conversion of mass of sediments into voxel and finally to tonnes/hectare is carried out as follows: ECa = 0. 1073 x Total-Salt mS/m; Total-Salt = ECa / 0. 1073 g/tonne; Since 1 voxel = 40 x 40 x 1 = 1600 m 3, taking the bulk density of dry sediments to be 1. 6 t/m 3, 1 voxel will contain 2560 tonnes (i. e. 1600 x 1. 6) of dry sediments. Thus, to convert g/tonne to tonnes/voxel Total-Salt (where ECa is in S/m instead of mS/m); Total-Salt = ((ECa x 1000) / 0. 1073) / 1000000 x 2560 t / voxel. Since 1 hectare consists 6. 25 voxels, Total-Salt = ((ECa x 1000) / 0. 1073) / 1000000 x 2560 x 6. 25 t / hectare; Total-Salt = ECa x 149. 11 t / hectare. We conclude that salt stored in fine-textured material is unlikely to be mobilised whereas salt contained in permeable sands is considered to have a higher risk of mobility if connected to appropriate flowpaths. The derived maps and data are then input into hydrogeological and salinity impact models to establish the links between irrigation and <b>salt</b> <b>discharge</b> to the river and floodplain...|$|E

This paper identifies the opportunities for establishing closer links between salinization and researches on other aspects of global change, which include integrating biophysical and social science disciplines. Using field and meteorological data of 92 meteorological stations around Tarim River Basin in Xinjiang of 38 years (1961 - 1998). we analyzed the characteristics of water-salt movement in Kuqa-Xinhe-Xayar Oasis, Tarim River Basin. The results showed that temperature and precipitation are both increasing gradually in the research area; the climate tends to be warmer and wetter.

Also, temperature rise obviously affects salt accumulation rates in the topsoil, but the influence is restrained by groundwater level, whose threshold is - 2 m.

This order established new requirements to assess the effect of and effort required to reduce salts in process water discharged to the subsurface. This includes the review of technical, operational, and management options available to reduce total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations in cooling tower and mechanical equipment water discharges at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL's) Experimental Test Site (Site 300) facility. It was observed that for the six cooling towers currently in operation, the total volume of groundwater used as make up water is about 27 gallons per minute and the discharge to the subsurface via percolation pits is 13 gallons per minute. The extracted groundwater has a TDS concentration of 700 mg/L. The cooling tower discharge concentrations range from 700 to 1, 400 mg/L. There is also a small volume of mechanical equipment effluent being discharged to percolation pits, with a TDS range from 400 to 3, 300 mg/L. The cooling towers and mechanical equipment are maintained and operated in a satisfactory manner. No major leaks were identified. Currently, there are no re-use options being employed. Several approaches known to reduce the blow down flow rate and/or TDS concentration being discharged to the percolation pits and septic systems were reviewed for technical feasibility and cost efficiency. These options range from efforts as simple as eliminating leaks to implementing advanced and innovative treatment methods. The various options considered, and their anticipated effect on water consumption, discharge volumes, and reduced concentrations are listed and compared in this report. Based on the assessment, it was recommended that there is enough variability in equipment usage, chemistry, flow rate, and discharge configurations that each discharge location at Site 300 should be considered separately when deciding on an approach for reducing the <b>salt</b> <b>discharge</b> to the subsurface. The smaller units may justify moderate changes to equipment, and may benefit from increased cleaning frequencies, more accurate and suitable chemical treatment, and sources of make up water and discharge re-use. The larger cooling towers would be more suitable for automated systems where they don't already exist, re-circulation and treatment of blow down water, and enhanced chemical dosing strategies. It may be more technically feasible and cost efficient for the smaller cooling towers to be replaced by closed loop dry coolers or hybrid towers. There are several potential steps that could be taken at each location to reduce the TDS concentration and/or water use. These include: sump water filtration, minimization of drift, accurate chemical dosing, and use of scale and corrosion coupons for chemical calibration. The implementation of some of these options could be achieved by a step-wise approach taken at two representative facilities. Once viable prototype systems have been proven in the field, systematic implementation should proceed for the remaining systems, with cost, desired reduction, and general feasibility taken into consideration for such systems...|$|E
40|$|Pliocene {{changes in}} Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) and its {{potential}} influence on northern North Atlantic thermohaline circulation prior and during the onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (NHG; 3. 7 – 2. 6 Ma) were investigated at westernmost Mediterranean Site ODP 978 (1930 m w. d.) and along the northeast Atlantic continental margin, at Sites DSDP 548 (1250 m w. d.) and ODP 982 (1135 m w. d.). Foraminiferal δ 18 O records (and geomagnetic events) formed the base for stable isotope stratigraphy {{which led to a}} major revision of age control at Site 982. The Nd isotopic composition (εNd) of bottom seawater served to trace back the origin of water masses. Sea surface temperatures (SST) were reconstructed from the alkenone unsaturation index (U￼k' 37) and Mg/Ca estimates on planktic shells. Bottom water temperatures (BWT) were estimated from Mg/Ca measured on epibenthic foraminifera. Epibenthic δ 13 C records were used as tracer of bottom water ventilation. This investigation consists of four interrelated studies. Study 1 provides new insights from proxy intercomparison. Uk' 37 ￼-based vs Mg/Ca-based SST estimates at Site 982 show that SST values derived from alkenones are ~ 1 °C higher than those based on Mg/Ca in planktic foraminifera. However, both proxies report similar climate trends. Over the period of fairly global stable climate between 3. 7 and 3. 3 Ma both proxies record a large orbital-scale variability that may be linked to changes in the strength and position of the North Atlantic atmospheric pressure systems and the position of the North Atlantic Current (NAC). From ~ 3. 3 to 3. 0 Ma northeast Atlantic SST underwent a major drop, a result that may contradict the PRISM concept assuming a time slice of largely constant climate conditions. Study 2 documents a major and long-term Upper Pliocene intensification of the Mediterranean outflow, 3. 5 – 3. 3 Ma. εNd values higher than - 11 to - 9 show that MOW spread continuously over the northeast Atlantic throughout the Upper Pliocene and reached up to the Rockall Plateau from 3. 4 until 2. 7 Ma and after 2. 55 Ma. From 3. 5 – 3. 3 Ma, northeast Atlantic Sites 548 and 982 showed a singular and persistent increase in bottom water salinities (BWS) by ~ 2 psu and in densities (BWD) by 1 kg m- 3, which was matched by a ~ 1 to 3 °C increase in BWT at Sites 548 and 982. This event of increased MOW flow was coeval with a unique and long-term rise in BWS by ~ 1 psu and in BWD by ~ 1 kg m- 3 of WMDW at West Mediterranean Site 978 which partly forms the source of MOW by turbulent entrainment. These changes were most likely linked to a major aridification in the Mediterranean region following a key change in the African monsoon system. Precisely at the same interval, surface waters of the Alboran Sea showed an increase of nutrient contents (decreasing planktic δ 13 C). The increase was most likely linked to an enhanced Atlantic inflow of nutrient-enriched surface waters that had to compensate for the enhanced outflow of MOW. Study 3 concerned the onset of major NHG from ~ 3. 0 to 2. 7 Ma, when the long-term average BWT and BWS at S. 548 decreased by 3 °– 4 °C and 2 psu, respectively, until 2. 82 Ma (MIS G 10). However, BWT and BWS at the shallower (and most distal) S. 982 continued to oscillate at a level that was 3 °C and 1. 5 -psu higher than today. Generally, BWD then was slightly higher at S. 982 than at S. 548. Accordingly, it appears that the coeval enhanced production of upper North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) may have diluted and/or rather displaced the core of the MOW tongue upward in the region off Brittany up to a level shallower than 1250 m w. d. (S. 548), although BWD still was about 0. 5 -kg m- 3 higher than today. Study 4 concerned potential links between the strength of MOW <b>salt</b> <b>discharge</b> and upper NADW formation. The increased advection of salt with MOW from 3. 5 – 3. 3 Ma did not translate into any trends of better ventilation (δ 13 C) of Lower NADW and Upper NADW, except for a single potential response of (distal) Upper NADW at Caribbean Sea S. 999. Likewise, the distinct change in MOW advection and salt injection after 2. 9 Ma was not linked to any coeval change in the ventilation of NADW. In total, the influence of MOW salt injections into the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) may be too small to produce any significant effects...|$|E

40|$|A bench-scale ion {{exchange}} process with batch biological denitrification of the spent regenerant brine {{was developed to}} remove nitrate &om drinking water. This research indicates that the combination procedure results in 50 percent reduction of regenerant consumption and 90 percent reduction in the mass of waste <b>salt</b> <b>discharged.</b> The process features a sequencing batch reactor to accomplish the biological denitrification of a 0. 5 N sodium chloride spent regenerant solution. Now being pilot tested in California, the process-which is simple, flexible, and reliable-should be suitable for use by small systems. Contamination of drinking water with nitrate 'presents a health hazard because nitrate (N 03 -) {{can be reduced to}} nitrite (NOz-) ion in the gastrointestinal tract. Nitrite causes methemoglobinemia, a sometimes fatal disease to which infants are particularly susceptible. In addition, nitrate and nitrite have the potential to form carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds that are potent animal carcinogens, al-though they have not been conclusively shown to cause human cancers. '* 2 Thus, the US Environmental Protection Agency and the European Community have es-tablished the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for N 03 [...] N at 10 mg/L and 11. 3 mg/L, re~pectively. ~. ~ Although nitrate is not normally signif-icant in pristine groundwaters, a recent survey of US wells found {{that more than half of}} them contained nitrate at detect-able levels, whereas an estimated 1. 2 per-cent of community wells and 2. 4 percent of rural wells exceeded the 10 mg N 03 [...] N/L MCL 5 In Europe the nitrate prob-lem tends to be worse because of the greater population density. For example, in 1970. 60 public water supplies intermit-tently exceeded 11. 3 mg NOB [...] N/L in En-gland and Wales; in 1980 the number was 90; in 1987 it had risen to 187. 6 World-wide, the situation is similar; nitrate contamination is ever increasing be-cause it results from human activities, particularly agriculture. As population increases, so does nitrate contamina-tion, because effective nitrate pollution prevention strategies have generally not been implemented.

25|$|Salinity {{is another}} {{important}} water quality issue.

However, more <b>salts</b> are being <b>discharged</b> into the Mediterranean Sea than are entering at Aswan (see Irrigation for agriculture in Egypt) so {{that in the long run}} the salinity of the water at the Delta barrages could decrease.

40|$|Seasonally managed {{wetlands}} in the Grasslands Basin on the west-side of California's San Joaquin Valley {{provide food}} and shelter for migratory wildfowl during winter months and sport for waterfowl hunters during the annual duck season. Surface water supply to these wetlands contain salt which, when drained to the San Joaquin River (SJR) during the annual drawdown period, can negatively impact water quality and cause concern to downstream agricultural riparian water diverters. Recent environmental regulation, limiting discharges salinity to the SJR and primarily targeting agricultural non-point sources, now also targets return flows from seasonally managed wetlands. Real-time water quality management has been advocated {{as a means of}} continuously matching <b>salt</b> loads <b>discharged</b> from agricultural, wetland and municipal operations to the assimilative capacity of the SJR. Past attempts to build environmental monitoring and decision support systems (EDSS's) to implement this concept have enjoyed limited success for reasons that are discussed in this paper. These reasons are discussed in the context of more general challenges facing the successful implementation of a comprehensive environmental monitoring, modelling and decision support system for the SJR Basin.

40|$|A six month-study was {{conducted}} on five desalination units in Sharm El-sheikh region. The final desalinated drinking water, the high <b>salt</b> brine <b>discharge</b> water, water from Sharm El-Maiya Bay and other seven different types of natural drinking bottled-water were bacteriologically analyzed in order to; first investigate the degree of potability of the produced desalinated water, to assess the possible environmental impact of the brine discharge on the Bay water quality and living organisms and third to estimate the desalination efficiency of the studied units. Sharm El-Maiya Bay is a quite small water basin from which water is pumped to the desalination units and in which high <b>salt</b> brine is <b>discharged.</b> A total of 76 samples were tested {{for the presence of}} certain bacterial groups of hygiene and quality control importance. Total viable bacteria (TVB), total coliforms (TC), faecal coliforms (FC), faecal streptococci (FS), haemolytic faecal streptococci (HFS), salmonella and shigella (S&S), aeromonads (Aerom.) and vibrios counts cfu/ 100 ml were estimated using 0. 45 µm bacterial filter technique on agar plates containing plate count agar and other differential and specific culture media. Salinity was measured in all samples. Bacterial count results showed unacceptable water quality for drinking. TVB counts ranged from 100 - 800 cfu/ 100 ml, Aerom. 5 - 600 cfu/ 100 ml, S and S 4 - 300 cfu/ 100 ml, vibrios 1 - 27 cfu/ 100 ml were very far from both the national and international standards. Bottled water reached acceptable standards. The results of bacterial counts in the discharged brine were 7 - 10 times more than those detected in the Bay water (control samples) which represent the feed water to the desalination units. Brine salinity measurements were at twice as high as these of the feed water. Both the high bacterial counts and salinity values may cause risky environmental changes in the Bay ecosystem especially on coral reefs, in fish aquoria, as well as to affect swimmers, snorkellers and scuba divers. Despite the high efficiency (100 %) of the reverse osmosis membrane technology in removing seawater salts, the investigated desalination systems were not satisfactory in producing bacteriologically- safe potable water...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} reactors {{operated by}} Douglas United Nuclear, Inc., use treated Columbia River water as the coolant on a once-through basis. Thus, radionuclides formed {{largely by the}} neutron activation of river <b>salts</b> are <b>discharged</b> to the river. One method of reducing the quantity of radionuclides in the effluent {{is to increase the}} efficiency of parent isotope removal during the coolant treatment process. It was recognized that an alum feed rate of 18 ppM is not necessarily optimum throughout the year. During certain periods it may be well in excess of requirements and overfeeding could be as detrimental to efficient parent isotope removal as underfeeding. Thus, a continuing effort has been underway to find a method for controlling alum feed rate to an optimum value. Flocculent feed rate control based on producing a constant value of the electrokinetic charge (zeta potential) of the floc has been practiced at some water treatment, plants. Although the hypothesis has not had universal acceptance in the water treatment field, laboratory and field data accumulated at Hanford indicated that further evaluation of the approach was warranted.
