40|$|A {{proof of}} concept of using a {{thermoelectric}} module to measure both thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of bulk disc samples at room temperature is demonstrated. The method involves the calculation of the integral area from an impedance spectrum, which empirically correlates with the thermal properties of the sample through an exponential relationship. This relationship was obtained employing different reference materials. The impedance spectroscopy measurements are performed in a very simple setup, comprising a thermoelectric module, which is soldered at its bottom side to a Cu block (heat sink) and thermally connected with the sample at its top side employing thermal grease. Random and systematic errors of the method were calculated for the thermal conductivity (18. 6 % and 10. 9 %, respectively) and thermal diffusivity (14. 2 % and 14. 7 %, respectively) employing a BCR 724 standard reference material. Although errors are somewhat high, the technique could be useful for screening purposes or high-throughput measurements at its current state. This new method establishes a new application for thermoelectric modules as thermal properties sensors. It {{involves the use of}} a very simple setup in conjunction with a frequency response analyzer, which provides a low cost alternative to most of currently available apparatus in the market. In addition, impedance analyzers are reliable and widely <b>spread</b> <b>equipment,</b> which facilities the sometimes difficult access to thermal conductivity facilities...|$|R

40|$|THE HIGH {{moisture}} content of mill mud (typically 75 – 80 % for Australian factories) results in high transportation {{costs for the}} redistribution of mud onto cane farms.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} size of farm equipment, {{the potential for}} soil compaction has become a real problem. According to some grain farmers, compaction from manure <b>spreading</b> <b>equipment</b> is a factor limiting their acceptance of slurry as a soil building and soil fertility resource. To {{address the issue of}} compaction caused by manure spreaders, eight on-farm sites were set up in the fall of 2004 and spring of 2005. At each site three treatments were applied (manure, farmer’s check, and tanker compaction only), and replicated three times. In addition to the on-farm trials, an on-station site was set up in Arlington. The on-station site examined the impact of multiple passes of heavy slurry equipment as might occur on field roads or headlands. After one year of field trials, it appears that compaction from manure spreaders does not adversely affect corn yields when it is applied in reasonably dry conditions. There {{was no significant difference between}} the three treatments in seven of the eight on-farm sites. Despite non-significant differences at the plot scale, hand harvests of the on-station trial showed a 10 to 15 % reduction in corn yield for rows that were directly within the tire track when there were multiple passes...|$|E

40|$|A. The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the particle size range of two organomineral fertilisers (OMF) that may enable broadcast application with standard fertiliser <b>spreading</b> <b>equipment</b> using conventional tramlines spacing. A theoretical model was developed which predicts the trajectory of individual fertiliser particles off-the-disc. The drag coefficient was estimated for small time steps (10 - 6 s) in the trajectory of the particle {{as a function of the}} Reynolds number. For the range of initial velocities (from 20 to 40 m s- 1) and particle densities (from 1250 to 1500 kg m- 3) investigated, the model showed that the particle size range for OMF should be between 1. 10 and 5. 50 mm in diameter. Given the assumptions made in the analysis, this size range is expected to match, approximately, the minimum and maximum landing distances of individual particles of urea (size range: 1. 00 to 5. 00 mm). It was suggested that OMF should have about 80 % of the particles in the range of 2. 25 to 4. 40 mm in diameter. Due to the characteristics of the materials, spreading OMF with spinning discs applicators may be restricted to tramlines spaced at a maximum of 18 m apart; especially, when some degree of overlapping is required between two adjacent bouts. The model presented herein requires validation with data obtained from spreading tests. ...|$|E
40|$|Road salt or {{rock salt}} {{as it is}} {{sometimes}} known, is a commonly used de-icing material and is used throughout Ireland by local authorities (i. e. county councils), private road operators {{and members of the}} public during times of freezing weather. County councils, road authorities and private road operators apply road salt as required as part of their winter road maintenance programs. The road salt used is predominantly sodium chloride (NaCl) as it is relatively inexpensive when compared to other de-icing agents, easy to manufacture and readily available. A number of negative environmental effects and a loss in water quality have been associated with stormwater (melt water) containing dissolved road salt entering fresh waterbodies in the vicinity of roads which are de-iced with sodium chloride. This study uses the M 3 motorway in County Meath as a case study. International findings from other studies on road salt are used to illustrate the potential pollution threat posed by spreading road salt. Recognised best practice for the mitigation of this pollution threat is reviewed and stormwater treatment methods along the M 3 are evaluated with regard to reducing sodium chloride levels in stormwater run-off. This study has found that treated stormwater from the M 3 does not cause a significant elevation in chloride levels. The treatment methods applied to the stormwater may remove the chloride from road salting and the receiving waterbodies dilute the chloride in the stormwater to concentrations that are below recognised toxic limits. A ‘Salt Management Plan’ is the key mitigation measure. Awareness of maintenance companies and staff to the pollution potential of road salt, training of employees, well maintained salt <b>spreading</b> <b>equipment,</b> pre-wetting of salt and active management of road maintenance particularly in areas where roads run in close proximity to waterbodies are essential to limit the threat of road salt to water quality and the environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} use of bio-materials for energy purposes is generating large amounts of ash. In most cases, e. g. during incineration of straw and grain, bottom ash contains small amounts of heavy metals, but significant amounts of the plant nutrients phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). Bottom ash also contains some micronutrients (e. g. copper and zinc) that are good for plants in small doses, together with generally small amounts of undesirable heavy metals, including cadmium. Biogas plants are becoming increasingly common in Sweden. They produce considerable amounts of digestate, a liquid fertiliser with a high content of nitrogen (N) comparable with that of pig slurry but lower contents of P and K. High quality biogas digestate may now be applied to arable land. This study investigated techniques and systems for blending and spreading liquid digestate with ash admixture. The physical and alkaline properties and solubility in water of some ash types were therefore studied at laboratory scale, as were the buffering properties of some digestates. The influence of ash admixture on digestate pH and ammonia emissions was also studied. At pilot scale, the properties of different ash/digestate mixtures were studied and a cell wheel for liquid manure was tested for adding the ash. Three types of ash (from oats, straw and wood pellets) and two types of digestate were studied. The ash produced so much dust that dust reduction measures and breathing masks proved necessary during handling. It also contained so much abrasive material {{that the risk of}} wear to pumps, pipes {{and other parts of the}} <b>spreading</b> <b>equipment</b> was rated high. It is therefore best if the ash can be added as late as possible to equipment for spreading on arable land, and also it can be prevented from passing through pumps and other moving parts. Only a minor proportion of the oat ash and straw ash was soluble in water. All three types of ash were alkaline and therefore increased the pH when mixed with water. However, the digestate had a high buffering capacity, so the overall effect on pH when moderate amounts of ash were included was slight. When oat ash was mixed into digestate, equilibrium concentrations of ammonia did not increase. There is thus no risk of increased ammonia emissions as long as the mixture does not contain more than 5 % ash. In fact, ammonia concentrations were lower when ash was added, possibly because of ammonia binding to some metal ions. In practice, the SNFS 1994 : 2 limit values for P and heavy metals mean that the test ash-digestate mixtures with 1 % by weight of ash can be applied to the same field at most twice in a three-year period. Mixtures with 3 % by weight of ash can be spread at most every third year and mixtures with 5 % by weight of ash at most every fifth year. Batch admixture of ash into liquid digestate is unsuitable, because the majority of the ash settles and forms sediment in the bottom of the tank, despite efficient stirring. For continuous dosage of finely pulverised ash into digestate, a cell wheel made for dosage of liquid manure can be used. However, for dosage into a flow under pressure a sluice is necessary to prevent digestate being pressed up into the ash container. Admixture of ash into solid digestate is another possible alternative, e. g. during movement of the solid fraction from a digestate separator to a store...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} this study {{indicate}} that farmer-feeders who finish as few as 700 head per year can compete with the large commercial feedlots from a cost perspective. The lack of a sophisticated feed mill does not prevent the farmer-feeder from being competitive with the large commercial feedlots in feed costs. This might be explained by the farmer feeder producing much of the feed, which reduces transportation and transaction costs. The farmer-feeder has non-feed costs that average 64 % more than those of the large commercial feedlots. The significantly greater costs for depreciation, repairs, and maintenance may be explained by having fewer numbers of cattle to <b>spread</b> the <b>equipment</b> over. As evidenced by the rapid structural change in the cattle feeding industry, it is not easy for the relatively smaller-scale farmer-feeder operation to compete in the cattle feeding industry.
