Upon reaching the Hatch, he finds no one there and rappels down the shaft on his own. While exploring, he comes across a painted mural, and a wall where the key hanging around his neck is pulled by a strong magnetic force. Finally, after being surprised by a bright light and loud music, he enters what appears to be an underground geodesic dome with computer equipment, including an Apple II Plus computer with its prompt glowing and its <b>shift</b> <b>key</b> relabeled execute. As Jack is about to use it, Locke appears and tells Jack not to touch it. After Jack raises the gun and asks where Kate is, Locke is revealed to be at gunpoint. The gunman threatens that he will shoot Locke if Jack does not surrender. Jack refuses, instead taunting Locke about his destiny. Finally, the gunman steps out and Jack seems to recognize him. The gunman is Desmond.|$|E

40|$|In Digital {{modulation}} {{the message}} signal {{is in the}} digital form and the carrier wave is in sinusoidal form. In this technique the Amplitude, Frequency or Phase of carrier varies according to message (Baseband) signal. There are various type of digital modulation technique like Amplitude <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying</b> (ASK), Phase <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying</b> (PSK), Frequency <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying</b> (FSK), Quadature Phase <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying</b> (QPSK), Differential Phase <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying</b> (DPSK) and other digital demodulation technique. Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time. The act of simulating something first requires that a model be developed; this model represents the key characteristics or behaviors of the selected physical or abstract system or process. The model represents the system itself, whereas the simulation represents {{the operation of the}} system over time. Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance optimization, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games.

25|$|Before the <b>shift</b> <b>key,</b> {{typewriters}} {{had to have}} {{a separate}} key and typebar for upper-case letters; in essence, the typewriter had two keyboards, one above the other. With the <b>shift</b> <b>key,</b> manufacturing costs (and therefore purchase price) were greatly reduced, and typist operation was simplified; both factors contributed greatly to mass adoption of the technology. Certain models, such as the Barlet, had a double shift so that each key performed three functions. These little three-row machines were portable and could be used by journalists.|$|E

If one wants to type the quotation mark but pressed that key alone, the symbol that would appear would be the apostrophe.

40|$|In recent years, various chaos based {{modulation}} schemes were evolved, {{of which}} the CS-DCSK modulation technique provides a better BER performance and bandwidth efficiency, due to its code domain approach[10]. The QCSK modulation technique provides double benefit, namely: higher data rate with similar BER performance and same bandwidth occupation as DCSK. By combining the advantage of code shifted differential chaos <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (CS-DCSK) and Quadrature chaos <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (QCSK) scheme, a novel CS-QCSK modulation scheme called code shifted Quadrature chaos <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> is proposed. The noise performance of CS-QCSK is better to most conventional modulation schemes and also provides an increased data transmission rates with greatly improved robustness. Analytical expressions for the bit-error rates are derived for both AWGN channel and Rayleigh multipath fading channel. The simulation result shows that the proposed method outperforms the classical approaches in terms of bit error rate and spectral efficiency.

25|$|Supreme Commander {{introduced}} several innovations {{designed to}} reduce the amount of micromanagement inherent in many RTS games. Holding the <b>shift</b> <b>key</b> causes any orders given to a unit (or group of units) to be queued. In this manner a unit may be ordered to attack several targets in succession, or to make best speed to a given point on the map and then attack towards a specified location engaging any hostiles it encounters along the way. After orders have been issued, holding the <b>shift</b> <b>key</b> causes all issued orders to be displayed on the map where they can be subsequently modified to accommodate a change of plan. Further, when a unit is ordered to attack a target, the player can issue an order to perform a coordinated attack to another unit. This order coordinates the arrival time of the units at the target automatically by adjusting the speed of the units involved.|$|E

Desktop computer keyboards, such as the 101-key US traditional keyboards or the 104-key Windows keyboards, include alphabetic characters, punctuation symbols, numbers {{and a variety of}} function keys. The internationally common 102/104 key keyboards have a smaller left <b>shift</b> <b>key</b> and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y).
