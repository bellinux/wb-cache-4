5|$|Unlike Planck, Einstein {{entertained the}} {{possibility}} that there might be actual physical quanta of light—what we now call photons. He noticed that a light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, the ultraviolet catastrophe, and the photoelectric effect. Stokes's law <b>said</b> <b>simply</b> that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than the frequency of the light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the promised}} {{financial}} reports did not come, and an August 2010 public announcement {{that the company}} was short on cash and planning more layoffs and was subject to its stock being completely delisted caused a precipitous drop in the stock's price, with the market valuation of the company falling below $1 billion. [...] CEO Dahan <b>said</b> <b>simply,</b> [...] "These are challenging times." ...|$|E

The first music video {{for the song}} was filmed in mid-2010, directed by Aggressive (the combined efforts of directors Alex Topaller and Dan Shapiro), and produced by Anke Thommen, but the video was reshot. Kretz <b>said</b> <b>simply</b> that the first video had [...] "the wrong director". The second music video was filmed in December 2010, directed by Dennis Roberts and photographed by Adam Bricker, however this video was also shelved in May 2011 without ever being released.|$|E

500|$|McGovern's legacy also {{includes}} {{his commitment to}} combating hunger both in the United States and around the globe. He said, [...] "After I'm gone, I want people to say about me: He did {{the best he could}} to end hunger in this country and the world." [...] In the view of Knock, McGovern in all his activities arguably accomplished more for people in need than most presidents or secretaries of state in U.S. history. Responding to the Serenity Prayer's desire to [...] "grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change", McGovern <b>said</b> <b>simply</b> that he rejected that notion: [...] "I keep trying to change them." ...|$|E
500|$|Bradburn's {{death was}} {{announced}} in Texas newspapers in a very neutral manner. [...] The Telegraph and Texas Register <b>said</b> <b>simply</b> that [...] "Gen. Bradburn, who had long been in the Mexican service, and formerly commanded the garrison of Anahuac, lately died at Matamoros". [...] However, the history books of the time did not speak kindly of his actions. [...] In his 1841 book Texas and the Texans; or, Advance of the Anglo-Americans to the South-West Henry Stuart Foote described Bradburn as an [...] "evil spirit, hovering, with gloomy and malignant aspect, {{in the rear of}} Santa Anna's army". [...] Henson posits that Bradburn was [...] "one of the most maligned men in historical accounts of that period", partially because he had no descendants to try to [...] "preserv his name and reputation in Texas".|$|E
500|$|As he {{had with}} Clay, Harrison {{resisted}} pressure from other Whigs over partisan patronage. When a group arrived in his office on March 16 to demand the removal of all Democrats from any appointed office, Harrison proclaimed, [...] "So help me God, I will resign my office before I can be guilty of such an iniquity!" [...] Harrison's own cabinet attempted to countermand the president's appointment of John Chambers as Governor of Iowa in favor of Webster's friend, General James Wilson; when Webster attempted to press this decision at a March 25 cabinet meeting, however, Harrison asked him to read aloud a handwritten note (which <b>said</b> <b>simply</b> [...] "William Henry Harrison, President of the United States"), then announced that [...] "William Henry Harrison, President of the United States, tells you, gentlemen, that, by God, John Chambers shall be governor of Iowa!" ...|$|E

500|$|In 1881, Coolbrith's poetry was {{published}} in book form, entitled A Perfect Day, and Other Poems. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, after Coolbrith's publisher sent him a copy, said [...] "I know that California {{has at least one}} poet." [...] Of the poems, he said [...] "I have been reading them with delight." [...] Yale poet Edward Rowland Sill, professor at the University of California and a keen critic of American literature, gave Coolbrith a letter of introduction that he wished her to send to publisher Henry Holt. It <b>said,</b> <b>simply,</b> [...] "Miss Ina Coolbrith, one of our few really literary persons in California, and the writer of many lovely poems; in fact, the most genuine singer the West has yet produced." [...] Quaker poet and former abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier wrote to Coolbrith from Amesbury, Massachusetts, to share his opinion that her [...] "little volume" [...] of poetry, [...] "which has found such favor with all who have seen it {{on this side of the}} Rocky mountains", should be republished on the East Coast. He told her [...] "there is no verse on the Pacific Slope which has the fine quality of thine." ...|$|E
500|$|In their {{analysis}} of the case, the journalists Simon Freeman and Barry Penrose state that Thorpe probably formed {{the outline of a}} plan to silence Scott early in 1974, after the latter's re-emergence became a matter of increasing concern. Holmes later said that Thorpe was insistent that Scott be killed: [...] " [...] he would never be safe with that man around". Uncertain how to proceed, late in 1974 Holmes approached a business acquaintance, a carpet salesman named John Le Mesurier (not {{to be confused with the}} actor of that name). Le Mesurier introduced Holmes to George Deakin, a fruit machine salesman who, he thought, would have contacts with people who might be prepared to deal with Scott. Holmes and Le Mesurier concocted a story involving a blackmailer who needed to be frightened off; Deakin agreed to help. In February 1975 Deakin met Andrew Newton, an airline pilot, who said he was willing to deal with Scott for an appropriate fee—between £5,000 and £10,000 was suggested. Deakin put Newton in touch with Holmes. Newton always said that he had been hired to kill, not frighten, citing the size of the fee that he was offered—too much, he <b>said,</b> <b>simply</b> to scare someone.|$|E
500|$|As A Short History of Film notes, A Trip to the Moon {{combined}} [...] "spectacle, sensation, {{and technical}} wizardry {{to create a}} cosmic fantasy that was an international sensation." [...] It was profoundly influential on later filmmakers, bringing creativity to the cinematic medium and offering fantasy for pure entertainment, a rare goal in film at the time. In addition, Méliès's innovative editing and special effects techniques were widely imitated and became important elements of the medium. The film also spurred {{on the development of}} cinematic science fiction and fantasy by demonstrating that scientific themes worked on the screen and that reality could be transformed by the camera. In a 1940 interview, Edwin S. Porter said that it was by seeing A Trip to the Moon and other Méliès films that he [...] "came to the conclusion that a picture telling a story might draw the customers back to the theatres, and set to work in this direction." [...] Similarly, D. W. Griffith <b>said</b> <b>simply</b> of Méliès: [...] "I owe him everything." [...] Since these American directors are widely credited with developing modern film narrative technique, the literary and film scholar Edward Wagenknecht once summed up Méliès's importance to film history by commenting that Méliès [...] "profoundly influenced both Porter and Griffith and through them the whole course of American film-making." ...|$|E

[...] Welsh stepped down at Virginia at the age of 67 after establishing himself as the winningest coach in UVA and ACC history. He compiled a 19-year record of 134–86–3 at Virginia, including a conference-record 80 ACC wins. Welsh led the Cavaliers to 12 bowl games and 14 consecutive years of winning at least 7 games.|$|E

2500|$|To {{connect the}} city {{with the rest of}} France, Napoleon III built two new {{railroad}} stations: the Gare de Lyon (1855) and the Gare du Nord (1864). He completed Les Halles, the great iron in glass produce market in the centre of the city, and built a new municipal hospital, the Hôtel-Dieu, in the place of crumbling medieval buildings on the Ile de la Cite. The signature architectural landmark was the Paris Opera, the largest theatre in the world, designed by Charles Garnier, crowning the center of Napoleon III's new Paris. When the Empress Eugenie saw the model of the opera house, and asked the architect what the style was, Garnier <b>said</b> <b>simply,</b> [...] "Napoleon the Third." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, at the First International UFO Congress in Chicago, Hynek {{presented}} his thoughts {{in his speech}} [...] "What I Really Believe About UFOs".

We must ask whether the diversity of observed UFOs ... all spring from the same basic source, as do weather phenomena, which all originate in the atmosphere", or whether they differ [...] "as a rain shower differs from a meteor, which in turn differs from a cosmic-ray shower." [...] We must not ask, Hynek <b>said,</b> <b>simply</b> which hypothesis can explain the most facts, but rather which hypothesis can explain the most puzzling facts.|$|E
