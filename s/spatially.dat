5|$|During the {{following}} decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated {{by a large}} number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably BOOMERanG, found the shape of the universe to be <b>spatially</b> almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that the spiking activity of hippocampal neurons is associated <b>spatially,</b> and {{it was suggested that}} the mechanisms of memory and planning both evolved from mechanisms of navigation and that their neuronal algorithms were basically the same.|$|E
5|$|Spacetime {{events are}} not {{absolutely}} defined <b>spatially</b> and temporally but rather are known {{relative to the}} motion of an observer. Minkowski space approximates the Universe without gravity; the pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of general relativity describe spacetime with matter and gravity. String theory postulates the existence of additional dimensions.|$|E
5|$|The city of Steelport was {{designed}} {{such that the}} player could identify locations without needing a minimap, with a <b>spatially</b> recognizable skyline and iconic gang vehicles in specific regions.|$|E
5|$|A {{wavefront}} splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront {{emerging from}} a point or a narrow slit (i.e. <b>spatially</b> coherent light) and, after allowing the {{two parts of the}} wavefront to travel through different paths, allows them to recombine. Fig.5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. Other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh interferometer.|$|E
5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is <b>spatially</b> extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine-derived melanin {{probably}} {{appears in}} at least some other biological systems as well. Some of the dopamine in plants is likely {{to be used as a}} precursor for dopamine-melanin. The complex patterns that appear on butterfly wings, as well as black-and-white stripes on the bodies of insect larvae, are also thought to be caused by <b>spatially</b> structured accumulations of dopamine-melanin.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Richard Apps and Martin Garwicz {{summarized}} {{evidence that}} microzones themselves {{form part of}} a larger entity they call a multizonal microcomplex. Such a microcomplex includes several <b>spatially</b> separated cortical microzones, all of which project to the same group of deep cerebellar neurons, plus a group of coupled olivary neurons that project to all of the included microzones {{as well as to the}} deep nuclear area.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1s Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), now disabled, {{consisted}} of two cameras: a 200mm focal length, low-resolution wide-angle camera (WA), used for <b>spatially</b> extended imaging, and a 1500mm high-resolution narrow-angle camera (NA) – the one that took Pale Blue Dot – intended for detailed imaging of specific targets. Both cameras were of the slow-scan vidicon tube type and were fitted with eight colored filters, mounted on a filter wheel {{placed in front of}} the tube.|$|E
25|$|An array or slide is a {{collection}} of features <b>spatially</b> arranged in a two dimensional grid, arranged in columns and rows.|$|E
25|$|When females {{continually}} {{move and}} are not <b>spatially</b> stable, males pursue a mate defense strategy. When the females are clumped, four types of polygyny occur.|$|E
25|$|In a {{cognitive}} radio system, unlicensed secondary users {{can use the}} resources which is licensed for primary users. When primary users want to use their licensed resources, secondary users has to vacate these resources. Hence secondary users have to constantly sense the channel for detecting the presence of primary user. It is very challenging to sense the activity of <b>spatially</b> distributed primary users in wireless channel. <b>Spatially</b> distributed nodes can improve the channel sensing reliability by sharing the information and reduce the probability of false alarming.|$|E
25|$|Neuroscientists Patrick Haggard and Daniel Wolpert have {{identified}} seven fundamental {{properties of the}} body schema. It is <b>spatially</b> coded, modular, adaptable, supramodal, coherent, interpersonal, and updated with movement.|$|E
25|$|In physics, the {{relativity}} of simultaneity is {{the concept}} that distant simultaneity– whether two <b>spatially</b> separated events occur at the same time– is not absolute, but depends on the observer's reference frame.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{when local}} {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium prevails in a body, temperature {{can be regarded as}} a <b>spatially</b> varying local property in that body, and this is because temperature is an intensive variable.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{specificity}} {{element of}} biochemical interactions to create synaptic plasticity, namely the importance of location. Processes occur at microdomains – such as exocytosis of AMPA receptors is <b>spatially</b> regulated by the t-SNARE STX4.|$|E
25|$|The College of the Propagation of the Faith or Propaganda Fide in Rome {{includes}} the Re Magi Chapel by Borromini, generally considered by architectural historians {{to be one}} of his most <b>spatially</b> unified architectural interiors.|$|E
25|$|For {{comparisons}} {{across different}} scans (within or across subjects), differences in brain {{size and shape}} are eliminated by <b>spatially</b> normalizing (i.e. registering) the individual images to the stereotactic space of a template brain.|$|E
25|$|When {{females are}} <b>spatially</b> stable {{in and around}} a {{resource}}, males pursue a resource defense strategy and polygyny occurs when the females are clumped and the offspring require little to no parental care (ex. yellow-bellied marmots, orange-rumped honeyguides).|$|E
25|$|Nonpoint source {{pollution}} (also {{known as}} 'diffuse' or 'runoff' pollution) {{is that which}} comes from ill-defined and diffuse sources. Nonpoint sources are difficult to regulate and usually vary <b>spatially</b> and temporally (with season, precipitation, and other irregular events).|$|E
25|$|One way {{in which}} many sign {{languages}} {{take advantage of the}} spatial nature of the language is through the use of classifiers. Classifiers allow a signer to <b>spatially</b> show a referent's type, size, shape, movement, or extent.|$|E
25|$|A Halbach array is {{a special}} {{arrangement}} of permanent magnets that augments the magnetic field {{on one side of}} the array while cancelling the field to near zero on the other side. This is achieved by having a <b>spatially</b> rotating pattern of magnetisation.|$|E
25|$|The {{works in}} Zero-on, {{especially}} those of calligraphic poetry, that were created out of <b>spatially</b> emphasized characters, {{are thought to be}} the influenced by the French poet Stéphane Mallarmé's Un coup de dés. Influences by John Cage and twelve-tone music are also noted.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spatially,</b> Lannemezan is {{wedged between}} the {{following}} nine communes: Campistrous to the northwest, Clarens in the northeast, Capvern to the west, Uglas and Pinas to the east, Avezac-Prat-Lahitte in the southwest, La Barthe-de-Neste and Escala to the south, and Cantaous to the southeast.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Catholic Church {{teaches that}} hell {{is a place}} of {{punishment}} brought about by a person's self exclusion from communion with God. In some ancient Eastern Orthodox traditions, Hell and Heaven are distinguished not <b>spatially,</b> but by the relation of a person to God's love.|$|E
25|$|Induced spatial {{autocorrelation}} (or 'induced spatial dependence') {{arises from}} the species response to the spatial structure of exogenous (external) factors, which are themselves <b>spatially</b> autocorrelated. An example {{of this would be}} the winter habitat range of deer, which use conifers for heat retention and forage.|$|E
25|$|Aural display: Several {{different}} types of audio systems exist to help the user hear and localize sounds <b>spatially.</b> Special software {{can be used to}} produce 3D audio effects 3D audio to create the illusion that sound sources are placed within a defined three-dimensional space around the user.|$|E
25|$|Gilbert et al. use 2D corners in both {{space and}} time. These are grouped <b>spatially</b> and {{temporally}} using a hierarchical process, with an increasing search area. At {{each stage of}} the hierarchy, the most distinctive and descriptive features are learned efficiently through data mining (Apriori rule).|$|E
25|$|True/inherent spatial {{autocorrelation}} {{arises from}} interactions among individuals located in close proximity. This process is endogenous (internal) {{and results in}} the individuals being <b>spatially</b> adjacent in a patchy fashion. An example {{of this would be}} sexual reproduction, the success of which requires the closeness of a male and female of the species.|$|E
25|$|Surface pattern {{analysis}} deals with <b>spatially</b> continuous phenomena. After the {{spatial distribution of}} the variables is determined through discrete sampling, statistical methods are used to quantify the magnitude, intensity, and extent of spatial autocorrelation present in the data (such as correlograms, variograms, and peridograms), {{as well as to}} map the amount of spatial variation.|$|E
25|$|In vivo {{ligand binding}} and {{receptor}} distribution {{can be studied}} using Positron Emission Tomography (PET), which works by induction of a radionuclide into a ligand, which is then released {{into the body of}} a studied organism. The radiolabeled ligands are <b>spatially</b> located by a PET scanner to reveal areas in the organism with high concentrations of receptors.|$|E
25|$|The reaction, most {{extensively}} researched in crayfish, allows crustaceans {{to escape}} predators through rapid abdominal flexions that produce powerful swimming strokes—thrusting the crustacean backwards {{through the water}} and away from danger. The type of response depends {{on the part of}} the crustacean stimulated, but this behavior is complex and is regulated both <b>spatially</b> and temporally through the interactions of several neurons.|$|E
25|$|An ecotope is {{a spatial}} term {{representing}} the smallest ecologically distinct unit in mapping and classification of landscapes. Relatively homogeneous, they are <b>spatially</b> explicit landscape units used to stratify landscapes into ecologically distinct features. They {{are useful for}} the measurement and mapping of landscape structure, function, and change over time, and {{to examine the effects}} of disturbance and fragmentation.|$|E
25|$|As {{the plane}} descended through clouds, the captain's {{attention}} {{was drawn to}} the artificial horizon which displayed excessive bank and pitch. Because such an attitude is highly irregular, the captain incorrectly assumed the indicators to be faulty. Without any visual references (due to the clouds) and having rejected the information from the ADIs, the captain and first officer became <b>spatially</b> disoriented.|$|E
25|$|Some of his masses are polychoral, a {{technique}} which involved multiple, <b>spatially</b> separated groups of singers. While {{this was also}} {{a technique}} which developed in Venice, it was widespread {{by the end of}} the 16th century: almost all composers of sacred polyphony used polychoral techniques at some time, especially those working in large acoustical environments (such as most cathedrals in Europe).|$|E
25|$|Since the {{resulting}} velocity vectors {{are based on}} cross-correlating the intensity distributions over small areas of the flow, {{the resulting}} velocity field is a <b>spatially</b> averaged representation of the actual velocity field. This obviously has consequences for the accuracy of spatial derivatives of the velocity field, vorticity, and spatial correlation functions that are often derived from PIV velocity fields.|$|E
