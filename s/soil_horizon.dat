25|$|The Ruby Ranch Member is {{the most}} {{widespread}} and distinctive member of the Cedar Mountain. It was named for exposures on the Ruby Ranch located southeast of Green River, Utah. The member is composed of maroon mudstones with irregular spheres of carbonate nodules. The nodules formed in ancient soils that developed in the mud deposited on the flood plain in a strongly seasonal, semiarid climate. Evaporation of groundwater {{during the dry season}} concentrated calcium carbonate and other minerals in the upper parts of the <b>soil</b> <b>horizon.</b> Radiometric dates place the upper portions of the Ruby Ranch in the late Aptian. Exhumed river channels in the Ruby Ranch indicate that stream flow during the Aptian was towards the northeast, the direction of the encrouching Western Interior Seaway.|$|E

[...] Because the burials in the conical mound dated to the Early Woodland period, the Fort Ancient period dating of the remnant ash bed is suggestive of ritual reuse of the circum mound area.|$|E
2500|$|During July 2012 James Wright, Andy Gaunt, Ben Crossley and David Budge opened two {{evaluation}} trenches to {{test whether}} or not the large 180m long geophysical anomaly identified by Gaunt in 2011 was in fact the palace boundary ditch to the south-west of the site.

50|$|The {{process of}} removal of {{materials}} from geological or <b>soil</b> <b>horizons</b> is called eluviation or leaching.

40|$|Fungi {{regulate}} key nutrient cycling {{processes in}} many forest ecosystems, but their diversity and distribution {{within and across}} ecosystems are poorly understood. Here, we examine the spatial distribution of fungi across a boreal and tropical ecosystem, focusing on ectomycorrhizal fungi. We analyzed fungal community composition across litter (organic <b>horizons)</b> and underlying <b>soil</b> <b>horizons</b> (0 – 20 cm) using 454 pyrosequencing and clone library sequencing. In both forests, we found significant clustering of fungal communities by site and <b>soil</b> <b>horizons</b> with analogous patterns detected by both sequencing technologies. Free-living saprotrophic fungi dominated the recently-shed leaf litter and ectomycorrhizal fungi dominated the underlying <b>soil</b> <b>horizons.</b> This vertical pattern of fungal segregation has also been found in temperate and European boreal forests, suggesting that these results apply broadly to ectomycorrhizal-dominated systems, including tropical rain forests.

However, knowledge of the ecology of microbial communities and their responses to such challenges in Arctic tundra soil remain limited, despite the central role these organisms play for ecosystem functioning. We utilised a plot-scale experiment in High Arctic tundra on Svalbard to investigate short-term variation (9 days), following simulation of a N deposition event (4 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1), in the structure and abundance of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities between organic and mineral <b>soil</b> <b>horizons.</b> T-RFLP analysis showed significant differences between horizons in bacterial and archaeal community structure. Q-PCR analysis showed that fungal abundance {{did not differ significantly}} between <b>soil</b> <b>horizons,</b> whilst bacterial and archaeal abundance was significantly higher in mineral than in organic <b>horizons,</b> despite <b>soil</b> water and total C and N contents being significantly greater in the organic horizon. In the organic horizon, bacterial community structure and fungal abundance varied significantly over time. In the mineral horizon, there was significant variation over time in bacterial abundance, in archaeal community structure and in both fungal community structure and abundance. In contrast, N deposition did not lead to significant variation in either the structure or the abundance of microbial communities. This research demonstrates that microbial community structure and abundance can change rapidly (over only a few days) in Arctic tundra soils and also differently between <b>soil</b> <b>horizons</b> in response to different environmental drivers. Moreover, this variability in microbial community structure and abundance is soil horizon- and taxonomic domain-specific, highlighting the importance of investigating microbial communities across all <b>soil</b> <b>horizons</b> and over short periods of time...|$|R
