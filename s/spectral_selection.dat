40|$|<b>Spectral</b> feature <b>selection</b> {{identifies}} relevant features {{by measuring}} their capability of preserving sample similarity. It provides a powerful framework for both supervised and unsupervised feature selection, {{and has been}} proven {{to be effective in}} many real-world applications. One common drawback associated with most existing <b>spectral</b> feature <b>selection</b> algorithms is that they evaluate features individually and cannot identify redundant features. Since redundant features can have significant adverse effect on learning performance, it is necessary to address this limitation for <b>spectral</b> feature <b>selection.</b> To this end, we propose a novel <b>spectral</b> feature <b>selection</b> algorithm to handle feature redundancy, adopting an embedded model. The algorithm is derived from a formulation based on a sparse multi-output regression with a L 2, 1 -norm constraint. We conduct theoretical analysis on the properties of its optimal solutions, paving the way for designing an efficient path-following solver. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm can do well in both selecting relevant features and removing redundancy...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, some <b>spectral</b> feature <b>selection</b> {{methods are}} {{proposed}} to choose those features with high power of preserving sample similarity. However, when there exist lots of irrelevant or noisy features in data, the similarity matrix constructed {{from all the}} un-weighted features may be not reliable, which then misleads existing <b>spectral</b> feature <b>selection</b> methods to select ’wrong’ features. To solve this problem, we propose that feature importance should be evaluated according to their impacts on similarity matrix, which means features with high impacts on similarity matrix should be chosen as important ones. Since graph Laplacian(Luxburg, 2007) is defined on the similarity matrix, then the impact of each feature on similarity matrix can be reflected on the change of graph Laplacian, especially on its eigen-system. Based on this point of view, we propose an Eigenvalue Sensitive Criteria (EVSC) for feature selection, which aims at seeking those features with high impact on graph Laplacian’s eigenvalues. Empirical analysis demonstrates our proposed method outperforms some traditional <b>spectral</b> feature <b>selection</b> methods. 1...|$|R

40|$|For {{applications}} like missile {{warning and}} automatic target recognition, AIM is presently launching its new 3 rd generation high speed dual-color module. The {{focal plane array}} (FPA) is a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) 192 x 192 56 µm pitch device in a dual-color mid wave (MWIR) design. The module provides <b>spectral</b> <b>selection</b> with temporal and spatial coincidence for both colors using a new AIM proprietary technology. The spectral bands presently selected are 3. 4 - 4 and 4. 2 - 5 µm with a full frame rate of 870 Hz. Prior to the new devices, a sequential multicolor MCT camera with broadband detector and <b>spectral</b> <b>selection</b> using a rotating filter wheel was developed and evaluated. Results are shown to demonstrate the capabilities of spectral selective detection specifically for clutter and false alarm suppression in missile warning applications. A new algorithm was developed to allow highly sensitive detection of missile plumes without any need for non-uniformity correction for long-term stable operation and maximum dynamic range. An outlook is given on new activities at AIM on dual-band devices.

In this context, we select the best spectral bands using a multilinear sparse decomposition based approach. Multispectral images of 35 subjects presenting 25 different lengths from 480 nm to 720 nm and three lighting conditions: fluorescent, Halogen and Sun light are groupped in a 3 -mode face tensor T of size 35 x 25 x 2. T is then decomposed using 3 -mode SVD where three mode matrices for subjects, spectral bands and illuminations are sparsely determined. The 25 x 25 spectral bands mode matrix defines a sparse vector for each spectral band.

40|$|A <b>spectral</b> feature <b>selection</b> {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} for multi-class automated rock recognition from real world drilling data using Gaussian Process classification. This work {{is part of}} a larger project aimed at surface mine automation. The motivation for this research is to investigate which combination of drilling data measurements is most relevant for rock recognition. We conduct feature selection in the frequency domain where characteristics are more distinguishable. In particular, we extended the <b>spectral</b> feature <b>selection</b> method from binary classification to multi-class classification by decomposing the multi-class classification dataset into a series of one versus one binary classification datasets. A non-uniform discrete Fourier transform (NDFT) is then applied to data on each of the binary classification features, where the features with the most consistent “major bandwidth” across all decomposed binary classifications are selected. The approach has been applied on multi-class rock recognition (based on drilling data) and results are presented on real world drilling data. ...|$|R

30|$|Conventional fat {{saturation}} with <b>spectral</b> <b>selection</b> {{of the fat}} peak {{based on}} CHESS (chemical shift selective) {{has the advantage of}} being fast but often delivers poor results in spine imaging.

However, this causes a reduction in the signal due to the inversion pulse. A compromise is to use SPAIR (spectral attenuated inversion recovery) preparation, which shows relatively robust saturation provided the shim box is placed correctly in the area of interest avoiding the lungs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of unsu-pervised feature <b>selection.</b> Recently, <b>spectral</b> feature <b>selection</b> algorithms, which leverage both graph Laplacian and spectral regression, have received increasing attention. However, existing <b>spectral</b> feature <b>selection</b> algorithms suffer from two major prob-lems: 1) since the graph Laplacian is constructed from the original feature space, noisy and irrelevant features may have adverse effect on the estimated graph Laplacian and hence degenerate {{the quality of the}} induced graph embedding; 2) since the cluster labels are discrete in natural, relaxing and approximating these labels into a continuous embedding can inevitably introduce noise into the estimated cluster labels. Without considering the noise in the cluster labels, the feature selection process may be misguided. In this paper, we propose a Robust Spectral learning framework for unsupervised Feature Selection (RSFS), which jointly improves the robustness of graph embedding and sparse spectral regression. Compared with existing methods which are sensitive to noisy features, our proposed method utilizes a robust local learning method to construct the graph Laplacian and a robust spectral regression method to handle the noise on the learned cluster labels. In order to solve the proposed optimization problem, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed. We also show the close connection between the proposed robust spectral regression and robust Huber M-estimator. Experimental results on different datasets show the superiority of RSFS. I...|$|R
