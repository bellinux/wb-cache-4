The model {{was used to determine}} the loading on the stone (principal stresses and strains and maximum shear stresses and strains) due to the impact of lithotripsy shock waves. The simulations show that the peak loading induced in kidney stones is generated by constructive interference from shear waves launched from {{the outer edge of the}} stone with other waves in the stone. Notably the shear wave induced loads were significantly larger than the loads generated by the classic Hopkinson or <b>spall</b> <b>effect.</b> For simulations where the diameter of the focal spot of the lithotripter was smaller than that of the stone the loading decreased by more than 50 %. The constructive interference was also sensitive to shock rise time and it was found that the peak tensile stress reduced by 30 % as rise time increased from 25 to 150 ns. These results demonstrate that shear waves likely play a critical role in stone comminution and that lithotripters with large focal widths and short rise times should be effective at generating high stresses inside kidney stones...|$|R
40|$|The SAMPLL (Simplified Analytical Model of Penetration with Lateral Loading) {{computer}} code was originally developed in 1984 to realistically yet economically predict penetrator/target interactions. Since the code`s inception, its use has {{spread throughout the}} conventional and nuclear penetrating weapons community. During the penetrator/target interaction, {{the resistance of the}} material being penetrated imparts both lateral and axial loads on the penetrator. These loads cause changes to the penetrator`s motion (kinematics). SAMPLL uses empirically based algorithms, formulated from an extensive experimental data base, to replicate the loads the penetrator experiences during penetration. The lateral loads resulting from angle of attack and trajectory angle of the penetrator are explicitly treated in SAMPLL. The loads are summed and the kinematics calculated at each time step. SAMPLL has been continually improved, and the current version, Version 6. 0, can handle cratering and <b>spall</b> <b>effects,</b> multiple target layers, penetrator damage/failure, and complex penetrator shapes.

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} {{experimental}} heat transfer results for boiling of CaSO 4 solutions {{on the outside}} of tube bundles, and also to shed some light into the mechanisms which influence heat transfer fouling under pool boiling conditions. Heat transfer coefficients for three heater rods with an identical diameter of 10. 67 mm on a 35 mm vertical pitch have been measured. The independent variables bulk concentration and heat flux have been varied from 0. 8 to 1. 6 g/L and 33 to 300 kW/m 2, respectively. The experimental results show that the mechanisms of fouling on the middle and top heater substantially differ from those at the bottom heater, due to the dominant effects of bubble impingement on the heat transfer surfaces. In particular, the competing effects on the degree of wall superheat and the supersaturation of the boiling liquid play a significant role. <b>Spalling</b> <b>effects</b> are more pronounced on the upper heaters where thin, friable deposits were found with low density and adherence, particularly at higher heat fluxes and lower concentrations.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper does {{a review}} of the recent {{achievements}} on the knowledge of UHPFRC properties and in the development of design procedures. UHPFRC is defined as a new material, with unique properties (high ductility, low permeability, very high strength capacity in compression, higher toughness) in comparison to conventional concrete. It is important to know both material and mechanical properties to fully take advantage of its outstanding properties for structural applications. However, since this is a new material, the current design codes are not well suited and should be reviewed before being applied to UHPFRC. In the first part, the following material properties are addressed: hydration process; permeability; fibers role; mix design; fiber-matrix bond properties workability; mixing procedure; and curing. In the second part, the mechanical properties of the material are discussed, together with some design recommendations. The aspects herein examined are: size effect; compressive and flexural strength; tensile stress-strain relation; shear and punching shear capacity; creep and shrinkage; fracture energy; steel bars anchorage and adherence. Besides, the tensile mechanical characterization is described using inverse analysis based on bending tests data. In the last part, material behavior at high temperature is discussed, including physical-chemical transformations of the concrete, <b>spalling</b> <b>effect,</b> and transient creep. In the latter case, a new Load Induced Thermal Strain (LITS) semi-empirical model is described and compared with UHPC experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Blast wave induced {{traumatic}} brain injury (bTBI) is a modality of injury that has come into prominence at the current time due to {{the large number of}} military and civilian personnel who have experienced the localized shock wave produced by explosive devices. The shock wave will travel concentrically outward from the explosive center, being absorbed and transmitted thru soft objects, such as tissue, and reflecting off stationary obstructions. Transmission and absorption in tissues can result in a number of physiological measureable injuries, the most common of which being what is frequently called “blast lung”. Blast lung involves the <b>spalling</b> <b>effect</b> at air-tissue interfaces. Another documented effect involves the asynchronous motion of tissue, particularly in the cranium, as the shock wave passes by. This predominately manifests itself in what is believed to be diffuse axonal injury and initiation of secondary injury mechanism. 	This study is designed to explore the relationship between shock waves and bTBI. A blast device was constructed for generating a free field shock wave through the high pressure rupture of a polycarbonate membrane. Air pressure in a small chamber is increased to a value several orders of magnitude greater than ambient air pressure and is held in place with the polycarbonate member. At the rupture of this membrane a shock wave is created. Measurements of this blast event, carried out with a piezoelectric pressure transducer, have shown that this shock wave is reproducible for the different membrane materials tested and is symmetrical with respect to the central axis of the high pressure chamber and exit nozzle. Having characterized the shock wave properties in the blast field, a location was chosen at which maximum shock wave pressure could be applied to the cranium for inducing bTBI. 	Experiments involving blast wave exposure were performed on two separate groups of animals in an attempt at establishing injury. One group was placed at a fixed distance directly below the blast nozzle, thereby experiencing both the shock wave and the associated air blast from the residual air in the chamber, and one placed at a defined distance off-axis to avoid the air blast, yet receiving two sequential blast exposures. All animal studies were approved by the VCU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 	The degree of injury was then assessed with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS). Image Data was acquired on a 2. 4 Tesla magnet for assessing changes in either the total percent water concentration or the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) of selected regions of interest in the brain of rats. Localized proton spectroscopic data was acquired from a voxel placed centrally in the brain. The baseline values of these parameters were established before the induction of bTBI. After the blast exposure, the animals were followed up with MRI and MRS at defined intervals over a period of one week. 	The first group of animals received blast exposure directly underneath the blast device nozzle and the MR data does suggest changes in some of the measureable parameters from baseline following blast exposure. This blast wave data though is confounded with additional and undesirable characteristics of the blast wave. The second group of animals that received a pure shock wave blast exposure revealed no remarkable changes in the MR data pre- to post- blast exposure. The percent water concentration, ADC and spectroscopic parameters were for statistical purposes identical before and after the blast. The resolution of this negative result will require reconsideration of the free field blast exposure concept...|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{array processing}} analysis {{is applied to}} 916 teleseismic short-period P-wave signals from 25 underground explosions at Pahute Mesa {{in order to establish}} whether coherent arrivals scattered from near-source velocity het-erogeneity can be identified. The signal coherence is measured using semblance, which can be statistically evaluated using the noncentral F-distribution if the noise properties are suitable. The effects of unsuitable correlated noise due to common path and receiver contributions are suppressed by applying station weighting functions obtained by stacking all observations at a given receiver. Similar corrections for individual events are applied to reduce biases due to variations in surface reflection times and <b>spall</b> <b>effects.</b> The characteristics of the spatial and phase velocity resolution of the semblance analysis are established by a series of synthetic calculations, including cases with random arrivals in the P-wave coda. The procedure is applied to the actual data under the assumption that any scattering structures present radiate isotropically, although this con-straint could be relaxed given independent knowledge of a particular scatterer's nature. The Pahute Mesa data show some evidence for enhanced scattering contributions to the first 15 sec of the P-wave signals from {{the western edge of the}} Silent Canyon Caldera.

50|$|Since the 1970s, HESH {{ammunition}} {{has increasingly}} {{fallen out of}} favour as armour designs have trended towards layered composites of hard metal and heat-resistant materials. This type of armour is a poor conductor of shock waves. Anti-spalling devices (spall liners), made of materials such as Kevlar, are commonly fitted to the interior surface of modern armoured vehicles to mitigate <b>spalling</b> <b>effects.</b> Another reason for the declining use of HESH rounds is the preference of most armies for smoothbore cannons. Rifling decreases the penetrating power of HEAT warheads because the centrifugal force of the spinning projectile tends to disperse the shaped charge jet, but this same effect can assist a HESH shell by increasing the surface area of contact. The British Army has persisted with a rifled cannon on their Challenger 1 and Challenger 2 battle tanks partly to preserve the general purpose capability of HESH ammunition. Nevertheless, the British Army had planned for a conversion to the more versatile smoothbore cannons, but the project was cancelled due to budget constraints. This would have allowed them {{to take advantage of}} commonality with NATO partners and the greater availability of smoothbore ammunition types, such as high-explosive (HE), time-fuzed and canister shot.

40|$|Multi-storey {{buildings}} with precast hollowcore concrete floor systems are {{very common in}} New Zealand and in many other countries, but the structural behaviour of such systems under fire exposure {{is not easy to}} predict because of the complex geometry, composite construction, and a wide range of possible support conditions. The 2006 version of the New Zealand Concrete Standard NZS 3101 introduces new details for connection of hollowcore floor units to reinforced concrete supporting beams to improve seismic performance, but the fire performance of the new connection systems is unknown. Currently available methods for simulating fire performance of hollowcore slabs are not suitable for design purposes. Therefore, a simple yet sufficiently accurate simulation method needs to be developed. This study was carried out using a proposed simulation method to investigate the fire performance of hollowcore floor slabs with different connection details between the hollowcore units and their reinforced concrete supporting beams conforming to NZS 3101. The proposed simulation method is examined on the platform of SAFIR, a non-linear finite element program that includes both thermal and structural analysis. The proposed simulation method was validated using available experimental results from a limited number of tests. It does not take account of shear and anchorage failures or <b>spalling</b> <b>effects,</b> so designers should consult other studies for this behaviour of hollowcore concrete flooring systems. By using the proposed simulation scheme in SAFIR, it is investigated whether the tensile membrane action established through beams parallel to the hollowcore units and different floor aspect ratios will enhance the fire resistance of hollowcore concrete flooring systems. From the simulation results it is concluded that rigid connections at both the ends and the sides of the hollowcore flooring systems to the supporting beams provide better fire resistance than rotationally flexible connections, and the fire resistance of hollowcore flooring systems can be increased by using stiffer supporting beams {{at the end of the}} slabs and also by decreasing the spacing between the beams parallel to the hollowcore units...|$|R

The concretes containing 10 mm aggregates spalled while the ones with 14 mm did not <b>spall.</b> Since this <b>effect</b> is the same in geopolymer and Portland cement concretes, it is independent of binders' chemical compositions. This paper shows that the degree of spalling has a good correlation to the fracture process zone length, which increases with increasing aggregate size; this in turn reduces the flux of kinetic energy from pore pressure and thermal stress that is released into the fracture front and thereby improves the spalling resistance...|$|R
40|$|During a fire, {{some types}} of {{concrete}} {{are known to be}} susceptible to a sudden detachment of the outer layer, known as explosive spalling, if a specific combination of influencing factors occurs. For a given reinforced concrete slab configuration, however, it is unclear which percentage of slabs can be expected to suffer from explosive spalling and whether possible spalling has {{a significant impact on the}} load bearing capacity and the deformations during fire. In this paper a methodology is developed in order to assess the probability of <b>spalling</b> and its <b>effect</b> on the deformations during fire exposure. A hydrothermal calculation method described in literature is combined with a full-probabilistic crosssectional calculation tool which allows to calculate the evolution of the mid-span vertical deflection during fire. The results indicate that for the investigated slab configuration the probability of occurrence of spalling is rather small (2. 7 %). However, when spalling occurs it has a significant impact on the deformations during fire, possibly even resulting in a premature collapse of the slab...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{the effect}} of {{temperature}} on compressive strength, spalling and mass loss of High Strength Concretes (HSCs) by fc′> 65 MPa is discussed. Average compressive strength of the HSCs was from 65 to 93 MPa, which was optimized by Taguchi’s method as {{a powerful tool for}} optimizing the performance characteristic of a product/process. This paper presents results of an experimental program on the effects of elevated temperature exposure on the mechanical properties and potential for explosive <b>spalling</b> of HSCs. <b>Effects</b> of four parameters; water to cement ratio (w/c), sand ratio, silica fume ratio and amount of silica fume (sf) addition are considered in tests.

In an ongoing research by the authors, issues {{that have not been}} investigated in the methods and models available today to calculate the remaining load-carrying capacity of the corroded structures are identified. Two main issues; i. e. high amount of corrosion leading to cover <b>spalling</b> and the <b>effect</b> of corroding stirrups, were investigated in an experimental program. Pull-out tests were carried out on beam-end specimens with long embedment length to study the anchorage capacity of a corroded bar. The specimens were subjected to electrochemical corrosion process leading to different corrosion penetrations prior to mechanical loading. Details concerning electrochemical corrosion setup, corrosion-induced cracking and numerical modelling of a corroding bar are presented in a companion paper subtitled “Part 1. Crack initiation, crack propagation and cover delimitation”. Three types of specimens, with stirrups, without stirrups and with corroding stirrups, were subjected to pull-out test. The test results showed a significant influence of stirrups not only on corrosion-induced cracking but also on anchorage capacity and failure mode in the pull-out test. Finally, the corrosion and mechanical testing phases were simulated in a finite element model using the corrosion and bond models earlier developed by Lundgren [1, 2]. The outcomes of the numerical modelling help to further understand the effect of high corrosion penetrations and presence of stirrups on failure modes observed in the experiments...|$|R
40|$|Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) is {{a process}} of gasifying coal in-situ to produce syn-gas. The gas thus produced, passes through the outflow channel that leads to the {{production}} well. As explained in part-I of this paper (Samdani et al., 2015), UCG can be divided in two distinct phases. The phase-I corresponds to initial vertical growth of the cavity and the output from phase-I model provides input to the phase-II model. This paper presents an unsteady state model for phase-II of UCG, wherein, the growth occurs in the horizontal direction towards the production well through the outflow channel. A compartment model, based on tracer studies performed on actual UCG cavity, is developed for phase-II of UCG. Here, the outflow channel is divided in small sections along the length, each consisting of rubble zone, void zone and roof at the top. This reduces the complexity caused by non-ideal flow patterns and changing sizes of different subzones inside the outflow channel.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of spalling {{is a major}} factor in determining the fire resistance of concrete constructions. The apparently random {{occurrence of}} spalling has limited the development and application of fire resistance modelling for concrete structures. This Thesis describes an experimental investigation into the spalling of concrete on exposure to elevated temperatures. It has been shown that spalling may be categorised into four distinct types, aggregate spalling, corner spalling, surface spalling and explosive spalling. Aggregate spalling {{has been found to be}} a form of shear failure of aggregates local to the heated surface. The susceptibility of any particular concrete to aggregate spalling can be quantified from parameters which include the coefficients of thermal expansion of both the aggregate and the surrounding mortar, the size and thermal diffusivity of the aggregate and the rate of heating. Corner spalling, which is particularly significant for the fire resistance of concrete columns, is a result of concrete losing its tensile strength at elevated temperatures. Surface spalling is the result of excessive pore pressures within heated concrete. An empirical model has been developed to allow quantification of the pore pressures and a material failure model proposed. The dominant parameters are rate of heating, pore saturation and concrete permeability. Surface spalling may be alleviated by limiting pore pressure development and a number of methods to this end have been evaluated. Explosive spalling involves the catastrophic failure of a concrete element and may be caused by either of two distinct mechanisms. In the first instance, excessive pore pressures can cause explosive <b>spalling,</b> although the <b>effect</b> is limited principally to unloaded or relatively small specimens. A second cause of explosive spalling is where the superimposition of thermally induced stresses on applied load stresses exceed the concrete's strength...|$|R

For most tests a polycrystalline sample was crushed against a monocrystalline platen. Two tests involved the cases where both the pyramid sample and platen were monocrystalline and where they were both polycrystalline. The ice behavior was viewed through the ice platen. Remarkably the behavior of the ice in all cases resembled that of prior tests where ice pyramids were crushed against rigid steel and acrylic platens and where observations included spalling, high-pressure zones and low-pressure zones. Spalling rates for the polycrystalline sample tests were significantly influenced by the resonant frequency of the ice-apparatus system, 350 Hz, and the load records showed several extended segments of lock-in at that frequency. This implies that the spalling rates were generally {{in the vicinity of the}} resonant frequency of the system and this lead, at times, to the rates adjusting to match the system resonant frequency. While small elastic oscillations of the ice-apparatus system were evident in the sawtooth load record for the monocrystalline ice sample test these did not result in lock-in since the spalling rate was much lower than the polycrystalline case and much more stress built up in the system between spalling events, that is, the load sawteeth had much higher amplitudes and longer periods. The difference in behavior of the monocrystalline and polycrystalline ice can be attributed to the presence of grain boundaries and the random c-axis orientations of the grains, where both promote <b>spalling</b> fractures.

40|$|M. Ing. This {{research}} project was initiated by a well-known international company (MAKRO SA), which had experienced floor joint problems occurring in their industrial floors. Floor joint problems i. e. joint damage and spalling {{of the joint}} area result, {{from a combination of}} construction workmanship and quality control problems, as well as from operational hard wheeled vehicle loading conditions. Damaging and spalling of joint edges are general problems occurring on warehouse floor slabs because of hard wheeled loads trafficking joints. In addition, joint filler detachment from the joint wall surface looks aesthetically poor and leaves the possibility of hygienic problems developing. In the case of MAKRO SA stores, the above problems are not acceptable and should be avoided at all costs. The objective of the report is to investigate solutions {{to solve the problem of}} joint damage in industrial floors due to problems occurring in practice, as described below. Floor joint edge problems are a result of three main reasons. First, subsoil quality. The quality of the subsoil is determined by the compaction effort and type of filler materials used, which in turn determine the amount of deflection that will be detected at joint edges. Subgrade quality determines whether deflection of the top concrete layer will occur. Poor compaction and filler material contributes to excessive deflection occurring due to inadequate support of the concrete floor slabs. Water penetration through the floor slab results in the fines of the subsoil being eroded or washed out, resulting in a less dense material, which will deflect under large vehicle and store racking loads. It is concluded that good quality subsoil conditions will result in less deflection and level irregularities of the top concrete floor slab, resulting in less joint damage and <b>spalling.</b> Secondly, the <b>effect</b> of floor and joint workmanship on damage and joint edge spalling. Level irregularities occur due to poor troweling or floating efforts at the joint area. Poor joint edge workmanship results from incorrect formwork removal from the joint wall resulting in a damaged joint edge and additional spalling of the joint to that occurring from wheel load impact. Joints undergo damage as forklifts traffic the joint area as wheel load and energ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{reliable}} methods of assessing the load-carrying capacity and remaining service life of corroded structures. Previous research has been mainly concerned with lower corrosion levels leading to cover cracking. Moreover, {{the main focus of}} the available knowledge concerns the corrosion of the main reinforcement; while the corrosion of the stirrups is often overlooked. Therefore, these two uncertainties; i. e. high amount of corrosion leading to extensive cover cracking and <b>spalling</b> and the <b>effect</b> of corroding stirrups, were investigated in an experimental program. Pull-out tests were carried out on eccentrically reinforced specimens with long embedment length to study the anchorage capacity of a corroded bar. The influences of the location of the anchored bar, i. e. middle or corner placement; {{the presence or absence of}} transverse reinforcement; the corrosion level of longitudinal reinforcement and the corrosion of transverse reinforcement were studied. The specimens were of three types in relation to the reinforcement arrangement and corrosion: specimens without stirrups, where the main bars were corroded (type A); specimens with stirrups where the main bars were corroded and the stirrups were protected by insulating tape (type B); and specimens with stirrups where the main bars and stirrups were corroded (type C). All of the specimens were subjected to accelerated corrosion, with an average current density of 100 µA/cm 2, for three time spans that caused a rebar weight loss up to approximately 20 % in the main bars and 35 % in the stirrups. All of the specimens showed longitudinal cracks along the main bars for relatively low corrosion levels. The corrosion level at first cracking was about 0. 6 % 1. 0 % corrosion weight loss; the cracks widened with increased corrosion levels. Crack patterns formed depended on the presence or absence of stirrups and whether the stirrups were corroded. The crack patterns showed differences between specimens with or without stirrups and when stirrups are corroding or not. The tests showed an important effect of the cover cracking in terms of loss of confinement. They also indicated that the bond behaviour and the failure were strongly governed by the position of the anchored bar, i. e. corner or middle positions, and the level of the corrosion attack. Stirrups played an important role after cover cracking, as they then became the primary source of confinement. The knowledge gained in this study contributes to better understanding of the effects of deterioration on structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the application of the computer simulation technique to study the performance of reinforced concrete columns in a fire environment. The effect of three different concrete constitutive models incorporated in the computer simulation on the structural response of reinforced concrete columns exposed to fire is investigated. The material models differed mainly in respect to the formulation of the mechanical properties of concrete. The results from the simulation have clearly illustrated that a more realistic response of a reinforced concrete column exposed to fire is given by a constitutive model with transient creep or appropriate strain effect The assessment of the relative effect of the three concrete material models is considered from the analysis by adopting the approach of a parametric study, carried out using the results from a series of analyses on columns heated on three sides which produce substantial thermal gradients. Three different loading conditions were used on the column; axial loading and eccentric loading both to induce moments in the same sense and opposite sense to those induced by the thermal gradient. An axially loaded column heated on four sides was also considered. The computer modelling technique adopted separated the thermal and structural responses into two distinct computer programs. A finite element heat transfer analysis was used to determine the thermal response of the reinforced concrete columns when exposed to the ISO 834 furnace environment. The temperature distribution histories obtained were then used in conjunction with a structural response program. The effect of the occurrence of spalling on the structural behaviour of reinforced concrete column is also investigated. There is general recognition of the potential problems of spalling but no real investigation into what <b>effect</b> <b>spalling</b> has on the fire resistance of reinforced concrete members. In an attempt to address the situation, a method has been developed to model concrete columns exposed to fire which incorporates the <b>effect</b> of <b>spalling.</b> A total of 224 computer simulations were undertaken by varying the amounts of concrete lost during a specified period of exposure to fire. An array of six percentages of spalling were chosen for one range of simulation while a two stage progressive spalling regime was used for a second range. The quantification of the reduction in fire resistance of the columns against the amount of spalling, heating and loading patterns, and the time at which the concrete spalls appears to indicate that it is the amount of spalling which is the most significant variable in the reduction of fire resistance...|$|R
