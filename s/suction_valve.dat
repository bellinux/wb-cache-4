50|$|An air <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> (SAV) is a {{subsystem}} used {{to reduce}} emissions in the exhaust gases of internal combustion engines.|$|E
5000|$|The Royal Enfield Bullet, {{from year}} 2006-current, uses an Air <b>Suction</b> <b>Valve</b> to reduce {{emissions}} in its exhaust gases. Royal Enfield Motors calls their Air <b>Suction</b> <b>Valve</b> the PAV, or Pulsed Air Valve. Its function is the same, using a vacuum at the intake to trigger a valve that pulses atmospheric air into the exhaust. The original [...] "iron barrel" [...] style engine did this with a hose from the PAV going to the exhaust pipe, the newer (2003-2009) AVL aluminum engine pulses the gas directly into the exhaust port {{on the head of}} the engine itself.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1935 and 1938, {{the company}} {{introduced}} {{a long list}} of valve and thermostat products, including automatic spring valves, ball float valves, pressure-controlled <b>valves,</b> diaphragm <b>valves,</b> <b>suction</b> <b>valves,</b> constant-pressure valves, room thermostats and drying filters. A logo reading [...] "Danfoss"—a portmanteau of the Danish words [...] "Danmark" [...] (Denmark) and [...] "fosser" [...] (to stream or sparkle)—was attached to all valves.|$|R
50|$|During the {{suction stroke}} of the {{delivery}} piston the medium is sucked in via the open <b>suction</b> ball <b>valve.</b> At {{the same time}} the ball valve on the delivery line is pushed into the valve seating by the underpressure resulting from the <b>suction</b> (automatic <b>valves).</b> In parallel with this, the second delivery piston is making the pressure stroke and forces the medium through the discharge ball valve and into the delivery line. The <b>suction</b> ball <b>valve</b> is pushed into its seating by the delivery line pressure and thereby closes off the connection to pump intake.|$|R
50|$|Gas is {{injected}} into the cylinder inlet manifold by individual gas electromagnetic valves installed {{as close to the}} <b>suction</b> <b>valves</b> as possible. The valves are separately timed and controlled by injection control unit. This system interrupts the gas supply to the cylinder during the long overlap of the <b>suction</b> and exhaust <b>valves</b> (just typical for slow-speed and medium-speed engines - within the valve overlap cylinder scavenging is performed). This avoids substantial gas losses and prevents dangerous gas flow to the exhaust manifold.|$|R
50|$|A {{mud pump}} is {{composed}} of many parts including mud pump liner, mud pump piston, modules, hydraulic seat pullers, and other parts.Parts of a mud pump:1. housing itself,2. liner with packing,3. cover plus packing,4. piston and piston rod,5. <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> and discharge valve with their seats,6. stuffing box (only in double-acting pumps),7. gland (only in double-acting pumps),8. pulsation dampener.|$|E
5000|$|The {{steel housing}} {{of the seat}} valve pump {{contains}} four hydraulically controlled seat valves, two suction and two delivery valves for the two hydraulic cylinders. The suction and discharge valves are synchronized with the hydraulics of the delivery pistons - this ensures that {{the contents of the}} delivery cylinder is equal at all times to the volume being pumped. Once the [...] "sucking" [...] piston reaches its end position, the corresponding suction or delivery valve is simultaneously closed or opened. If there is overpressure in the delivery line, the <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> will close first. This prevents the pumped medium from being pushed out of the pressure line back into the hopper.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} jack uses a liquid, which is incompressible, that is {{forced into a}} cylinder by a pump plunger. Oil is used since it is self lubricating and stable. When the plunger pulls back, it draws oil out of the reservoir through a suction check valve into the pump chamber. When the plunger moves forward, it pushes the oil through a discharge check valve into the cylinder. The <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> ball is within the chamber and opens with each draw of the plunger. The discharge valve ball is outside the chamber and opens when the oil is pushed into the cylinder. At this point the suction ball within the chamber is forced shut and oil pressure builds in the cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|Engine: No.30. Twin-{{cylinder}} horizontal, each cylinder 4" [...] dia. x 6" [...] stroke. Inlet <b>valves</b> <b>suction</b> operated: exhaust <b>valves</b> mechanically operated. Water-cooled, with no pump or cooling fan.|$|R
50|$|These {{consist of}} a {{cylinder}} with a reciprocating plunger. The <b>suction</b> and discharge <b>valves</b> are mounted in {{the head of the}} cylinder. In the suction stroke the plunger retracts and the <b>suction</b> <b>valves</b> open causing <b>suction</b> of fluid into the cylinder. In the forward stroke the plunger pushes the liquid out of the discharge valve.Efficiency and common problems: With only one cylinder in plunger pumps, the fluid flow varies between maximum flow when the plunger moves through the middle positions, and zero flow when the plunger is at the end positions. A lot of energy is wasted when the fluid is accelerated in the piping system. Vibration and water hammer may be a serious problem. In general the problems are compensated for by using two or more cylinders not working in phase with each other.|$|R

The intake system of a compressor {{plays an important role}} on the performance of reed type valves of small hermetic refrigeration compressors, especially <b>suction</b> <b>valves</b> designed without an opening limiter. The valve affects directly volumetric and energy losses and may have some influence on the compressor noise level as well. A number of methods have been proposed to analyze gas pulsations in intake and discharge systems. If pulsations are small compared to the mean pressure...|$|R
50|$|Ina Mactavish left South Shields on the River Tyne on {{the morning}} of 16 October 1907 bound for Aberdeen, laden with 130 tons of lime. At about 22:00, the ship's {{condenser}} broke down as a nut had come off the <b>suction</b> <b>valve.</b> Around 06:00 on 17 October, the engines were stopped because a rope had become entangled around the propeller. It was decided to beach the ship, and shortly before 09:00 the ship grounded to the south of Birling Car Rock in Alnmouth Bay. It took until 15:00 for the Alnmouth lifeboat to rescue the survivors. By this time the ship's engineer and cook had both drowned. For their part in trying to rescue the crew, P. Holbert, chief boatman of coastguard, Amble; A. Barton, Police Sergeant, of Amble and J. Helm, police constable of Warkworth were each awarded a Sea Gallantry Medal.|$|E
50|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{never have}} a <b>suction</b> <b>valve,</b> but depending on the application {{may or may not}} have a discharge valve. The use of a dynamic discharge valve is more prominent in high pressure ratio applications, typical of refrigeration. Typically, an air-conditioning scroll does not have a dynamic discharge valve. The use of a dynamic discharge valve improves scroll compressor efficiency over a wide range of operating conditions, when the operating pressure ratio is well above the built-in pressure ratio of the compressors. If the compressor is designed to operate near a single operating point, then the scroll compressor can actually gain efficiency around this point if there is no dynamic discharge valve present (since there are additional discharge flow losses associated with the presence of the discharge valve as well as discharge ports tend to be smaller when the discharge is present).|$|E
50|$|A good {{explanation}} can {{be found}} in the 1901 article referenced below: The operation of the pulsometer is as follows: The ball being at the entrance of the left-hand chamber, and the right-hand being full of water, steam enters, pressing on the surface of the water, and forcing it out through the discharge passage. A rapid condensation of steam occurs from contact with the water and with the walls of the chamber, previously cooled by the water. When the water level has reached the horizontal edge of the discharge passage, a large volume of steam suddenly escapes and is at once condensed by the relatively cold water between the chamber and the discharge valve. The pressure in the chamber quickly decreases; it cannot be sustained by steam from the boiler, for, in accordance with the inventor's first specifications, the steam pipe is small. If now the pressure in the left chamber is equal, or nearly equal, to that in the right, friction caused by the rapid flow of steam past the ball will draw the ball over and close the right-hand chamber. Cut off from further supply, the steam, in contact with water, begins to condense; a jet of cold water from the discharge pipe spurts up through the injection tube, and by breaking into spray against the side of the steam space, completes the condensation. The partial vacuum produced brings water through the <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> to fill the chamber; but at the same time the air valve admits a little air, which passes up ahead of the water and forms an elastic cushion to prevent the water from striking violently against the steam ball. The air chamber is for the purpose of preventing water-hammer in the suction pipe.|$|E

50|$|Plunger pumps {{component}} {{materials are}} chosen for wear and {{contact with the}} media type. Component materials include bronze, brass, steel, stainless steel, iron, nickel alloy, or other material. For example, plunger pumps that function in general service or oil service applications often have an iron cylinder and plunger. The plunger, discharge <b>valves,</b> and <b>suction</b> <b>valves</b> {{come in contact with}} the media type transferred, and material choices are based on the fluid transferred. In power applications where continuous duty plunger pumps are needed, solid ceramic plungers may be used when in contact with water and oil, but may not be compatible for use with highly acidic media types.|$|R
50|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{tend to be}} {{very compact}} and smooth running and so do not require spring suspension. This allows them to have very small shell enclosures which reduces overall cost but also results in smaller free volume. This is a weakness in terms of liquid handling. Their corresponding strength is in the lack of <b>suction</b> <b>valves</b> which moves the most probable point of failure to the drive system which may be made somewhat stronger. Thus the scroll mechanism is itself more tolerant of liquid ingestion {{but at the same time}} is more prone to experience it in operation. The small size and quiet operation of a scroll compressor allow for the unit to be built into high power density computers, like IBM mainframes. Scroll compressors also simplify the piping design, since they require no external connection for the primary coolant.|$|R
40|$|Suction {{pressure}} pulsations created when the <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> opens {{are caused by}} unsteady mass flow through the valve exciting acoustic resonances in the suction plenum. These {{pressure pulsations}} influence valve dynamics, compressor performance and compressor noise. This paper will show the importance of including the cylinder bore volume in the flow path analysis in order to accurately calculate pressure pulsations. Pressure pulsations will be calculated using Finite Element Method (FEM) calculated impedance transfer matrix method in a quasi-static solution. The method models the impedance of the suction plenum flow path including cylinder bore volume using a static geometry condition just after the <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> opens. The interaction between the suction plenum, <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> port geometry, and cylinder bore volume influence acoustic resonances in this system. These resonances cause pressure pulsations that effect valve dynamics. This paper uncouples {{the dynamics of the}} <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> from the pressure pulsation modeling. This was done to specifically look at pressure pulsation created due to refrigerant volume flow through the <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> and suction plenum acoustic resonances without valve dynamics influencing pressure pulsation. The paper then compares simulated suction plenum pressure pulsations when the valve opens to measured pressure pulsation in a reciprocating residential HVAC compressor with good agreement...|$|E

30|$|Depending on the {{increase}} in the pressure of ammonia gas in tank A, the compressor <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> of tank B opens, and thus, the entire amount of ammonia gas enters tank B from tank A. When the compressor <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> is open, the compressor does not run, because the ammonia gas, which is vaporized in tank A and passed to tank B, can decrease the ammonia gas concentration in tank B. The main principle in this process is {{the increase}} in the ammonia concentration in tank B.|$|E
40|$|Comprehensive {{models are}} widely adopted {{to predict the}} {{performance}} of compressors due to their low computational cost and acceptable prediction capability. In general, the accuracy of such models depends strongly on the correct adjustment of some parameters that are of difficult to determine both analytically and experimentally. However, due to the nonlinearities of the compressor model, the tuning of such parameters affects many output variables and hence can be very challenging and time consuming. In this paper, we consider this procedure of adjustment of parameters as a multiple objective optimization problem that can be solved by using an elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The parameters of two simulation models are adjusted following this new procedure. In the first model the suction muffler was neglected and a mass-spring-damper system was adopted to predict the <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics. The second model solves the <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics by the finite {{element method and the}} flow in the suction muffler with the finite volume method. In both models the clearance volume and parameters associated with the <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> were chosen to be adjusted while the deviations between predictions and measurements for the mass flow rate, indicated power, and <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics were defined as the objective functions to be minimized...|$|E

40|$|Tutorialpg. 221 Compared to {{leading edge}} {{technologies}} such as high speed turbomachinery, reciprocating pumps {{may appear to be}} a simple technology: A reciprocating plunger causes liquid to be drawn from a low pressure manifold through the <b>suction</b> check <b>valves,</b> and expelled into a high pressure manifold through the discharge check valves. However, the interaction of flow, valve dynamics, and the acoustics of the pump and piping system can generate high amplitude pressure pulsation, causing severe vibration and reliability problem in some systems. The effects of improperly operating valves, and the successful resolution of such problems with valve design modifications are examined. Since the pump vales are operated by the action of the fluid, valve components (including the spring, valve body, valve disc shape, and sealing surfaces, etc.) must be carefully selected to ensure that the valves open and close at the appropriate times. Problems associated with valve dynamics include over pressure spikes at the opening of discharge valves, under pressure spikes {{at the opening of the}} <b>suction</b> <b>valves,</b> high noise levels, and excessive wear of valve components. Severe over pressure spikes have been known to cause fatigue failures of pump working barrels, connecting rods, bearings, and even drive-train components. Under pressure spikes can cause cavitation that can also lead to plunger and valve failures, due to pitting damage. High level valve noise is usually indicative of sever impacts associated with the opening and closing of the valves. Impacts at the valve closing are sometimes referred to as valve hammer and can result in damage to the sealing surfaces. Impacts at the valve opening, which may be identified by damage to the back side of the valve disc, are due to the over pressure and under pressure spikes which can result in fatigue failures of the components. Excessive valve wear can also be experienced when the valve disc material is not suitable for the pumping conditions. The use of field data coupled with a computer model to analyze the valve dynamics will be presented. Using this tool, the effect of various valve modifications such as changes in sealing surfaces, valve lift, spring preload, and spring stiffness can be observed. Instrumentation and data analysis techniques to evaluate these problems will also be discussed. The effects of modifications to valves (including changes in lift, spring preload, spring construction and stiffness, valve disc geometries, etc.) will be examined using data from actual systems...|$|R
40|$|Hermetic {{reciprocating}} compressors {{are widely}} used in small and medium size vapor compression refrigeration systems. One of the main parts {{of this type of}} compressor is the automatic valve system used to control the suction and discharge processes. As the opening and closing of the valves are caused by the forces produced by the refrigerant flow itself, the understanding of this fluid-structure interaction problem which characterizes the system dynamics is of fundamental importance in order to enhance the efficiency of the valve system. The numerical simulation of the flow has been used as an efficient method to perform this task. Most of the researchers simulated this problem by considering whether a geometric simplification for the valve (radial diffuser) or a simplification for the dynamics of the structure (one degree of freedom). In order to overcome these two drawbacks, in this work we simulate numerically the fluid structure interaction problem in a real geometry usually used in <b>suction</b> <b>valves</b> by considering a 3 D complete model for both the flow and the dynamics of the structure. The Ansys CFX CFD-Computational Fluid Dynamics software was used for the simulation of the flow coupled with the structure module available in the Ansys Mechanical. In addition, a 1 D model (one degree of freedom) was also implemented for simulating the dynamics of the structure for comparison reasons. The models were validated against experimental data for the aperture of the valve. We show that the 1 D model saves small computational time and provides good results for general characteristics of the problem as the force acting on the valve and the aperture of the valve, while the 3 D complete model allows us to predict the deformation of the structure. We suggest the use of the 3 D complete model because the computational time is not significantly increased...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Municipal {{solid wastes}} {{collected}} in sanitary landfill contain {{a significant percentage}} of organic substances whose degradation produces a large amount of biogas, that, due to the large methane content, is a precious source of energy and has high global warming potential. The biogas can be collected and use in internal combustion engines to produce electrical and thermal energy. In the following, a sanitary landfill located in central Italy has been experimentally investigated, to study the behaviour of biogas captation wells with different positions of the <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> with an innovative methodology: the infrared (IR) thermography. This is a visual representation of the natural emission due to the reflection of the infrared radiations. The IR thermography can be applied in landfills, because the biogas migrates to the surface at a higher temperature than the surrounding environment heating the soil through which it flows. By measuring the temperature of the soil in the landfill it is possible to detect biogas leakages and migration to the atmosphere. In this paper the area of influence of one well has been analysed in detail, to evaluate the biogas emissions during the opening and closing of <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> positioned in head of the well. Studying the IR images, it is possible to evaluate the soil heating around the well and to correlate the thermal anomaly with the flow rate through the <b>suction</b> <b>valve.</b> In fact, during the acquisition sequences, it was possible to locate the optimal opening position of the <b>suction</b> <b>valve</b> analysing the soil temperature around the well.
