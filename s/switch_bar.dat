40|$|Subtidal nearshore sandbars may exhibit cyclic net {{offshore}} migration {{during their}} multi-annual lifetime along many sandy coasts. Although {{this type of}} behavior can extend continuously for several kilometers, alongshore variations in cross-shore bar position and bar amplitude are commonly observed. Alongshore variability is greatest when bars display km-scale disruptions, indicative of a distinct alongshore phase shift in the bar cycle. An outer bar is then attached to an inner bar, forming a phenomenon known as a <b>bar</b> <b>switch.</b> Here, we investigate such large-scale alongshore variability using a process-based numerical profile model and observations at 24 transects along a 6 [*]km section of the barred beach at Noordwijk, The Netherlands. When alongshore variability is limited, the model predicts that the bars migrate offshore at approximately the same rate (i. e. the bars remain in phase).

40|$|Nearshore sandbars have a {{lifetime}} of many years, during which they exhibit cyclic, offshore directed behaviour with strong alongshore coherence. A bar is generated near the shoreline and grows in height and width while migrating offshore, before finally decaying at the seaward limit of the surf zone. It may take 10 to 15 years for a bar to exhibit this cycle. Four to five bars may occur simultaneously within a cross-shore bed profile. Alongshore variations in cross-shore bar position and bar amplitude are commonly observed. A strong or abrupt alongshore variability {{is referred to as}} a <b>bar</b> <b>switch.</b> At large spatial scales, the inter-annual bar dynamics may vary considerably across sites with very similar environmental settings. In particular, the bar cycle return period (T r, i. e. the duration between two successive bar decay events) may differ by a factor of three to four. This type of change in T r appears to be always present in time and is characterized as a persistent <b>bar</b> <b>switch.</b> At smaller (kilometer) scales, <b>bar</b> <b>switches</b> typically occur in areas with similar T r -values on both sides of a <b>bar</b> <b>switch</b> and occasionally disappear when the bars re-attach. These are characterized as non-persistent <b>bar</b> <b>switches.</b> The assimilation of shoreface nourishments into the coastal system involves a strong interaction with the pre-existing sandbar system. Typically the placement of a shoreface nourishment just seaward of an outer bar reverses the bar cycle temporalily, inducing a landward migration of the bar system. The shoreface nourishment becomes absorbed in the coastal system as the new outer bar. At the distal ends of the shoreface nourishment <b>bar</b> <b>switches</b> often manifest, owing to a distinct difference in the bar migration cycle phase that is induced. Given the importance of the bar-nourishment interaction, an improved understanding of the nearshore bar dynamics is expected to improve the efficacy of shoreface nourishments. Furthermore, the long-term evolution of the nearshore barred profiles is generally considered indicative {{of the quality of the}} modelling for the response of the entire nearshore coastal system. Therefore, the ability to perform reliable and robust a-priori, long-term predictions has broad societal relevance in view of anticipated adverse impacts of climate change and sea level rise on the stability of coasts worldwide. Until now the anatomy of the nearshore sandbars has primarily been studied using field data. Although these studies have provided insight into how the geometric bar parameters respond to the external forcings, no comprehensive conceptual framework is available that explains the full life cycle of a sandbar and its associated characteristics. The overarching objective of this study is to elucidate the anatomy of the inter-annual bar morphology using a combined data and model approach. This overarching objective is in turn devolved into three objectives aiming to understand key features of bar morphology and a further objective to enable a comprehensive modelling approach based on the acquired insights. The latter objective involves the development of an input-reduction framework for advanced process-based forward modelling of the inter-annual bar morphology.     1) To elucidate the morphodynamic processes that result in cross-shore transient sandbar amplitude responses (i. e. the transition from bar growth in the intertidal and across surf zone to sandbar decay at the seaward edge of the surf zone).   2) To establish the role of cross-shore processes in non-persistent <b>bar</b> <b>switches.</b> 3) To identify the dominant environmental variables and the associated mechanisms that govern the bar cycle return period.   4) To develop an input-reduction framework to enable the application of state-of-the-art process based forward area models to simulate the multi-annual bar behaviour and nearshore morphology.    A comprehensive study approach is adopted in which observations of the nearshore morphology are combined with detailed forward modeling of the bar dynamics at Noordwijk (The Netherlands) utilizing wave and waterlevel observations as boundary conditions. The Noordwijk model acts as a reference for additional simulations at Egmond (The Netherland) and at Hasaki (Japan) to address the specific characteristics of the nearshore sandbar morphodynamics as outlined above.   The transient cross-shore bar amplitude response  Based on a three-year hindcast of a bar cycle at Noordwijk (Netherlands) and on additional synthetic runs using a wave-averaged cross-shore process model, the dominant mechanisms that govern the bar amplitude growth and decay during net inter-annual offshore migration are identified. The bar amplitude response is particularly sensitive to the water depth above the bar crest, h Xb, and the angle of wave incidence, θ. These variables largely control the amount of waves breaking on the bar and the strength and cross-shore distribution of the associated longshore current. The longshore current has its maximum landward of the bar crest, inducing additional stirring of sediment on the landward bar slope and trough. The enhanced sediment concentration in the trough region shifts the cross-shore transport peak landward of the bar crest, forcing bar amplitude growth during offshore migration. For increased h Xb -values wave breaking becomes less frequent, reducing the influence of the longshore current on sediment stirring. Therefore, the resulting dominance of the cross-shore current results in a sediment transport peak at, or just seaward of, the bar crest causing bar amplitude decay. All four types of bar response (viz. all combinations of onshore/offshore migration and bar amplitude growth/decay) can occur for a single wave height and wave period combination, depending on h Xb and θ. Additional hindcast runs in which the wave direction was assumed time-invariant confirmed that h Xb and θ largely control the transient bar amplitude response.   The mechanics of non-persistent <b>bar</b> <b>switches</b>  Intra-site alongshore variability is greatest when bars display km-scale disruptions, indicative of a distinct alongshore phase shift in the bar cycle. An outer bar is then, for example, attached to an inner bar, referred to as a non-persistent <b>bar</b> <b>switch.</b> This large-scale alongshore variability is investigated by applying the reference model at 24 transects along a 6 km section of the barred beach at Noordwijk (The Netherlands). When alongshore variability is limited, the model predicts that the bars migrate offshore at approximately the same rate (i. e. the bars remain in phase). Only under specific bar configurations with high wave-energy levels is an increase in the alongshore variability predicted. This suggests that cross-shore processes may trigger a switch in the case of specific antecedent morphological configurations combined with storm conditions. It is expected that three-dimensional (3 D) flow patterns augment the alongshore variability in such instances. In contrast to the observed bar behaviour, predicted bar morphologies on either side of a switch remain in different phases, even though the bars are occasionally located at a similar cross-shore position. In short, the 1 D profile model is not able to remove a <b>bar</b> <b>switch.</b> This data-model mismatch suggests that 3 D flow patterns are key to the dissipation of <b>bar</b> <b>switches.</b>   The mechanics of persistent <b>bar</b> <b>switches</b> and the <b>bar</b> cycle return period  To date, data-analytic studies have had only partial success in explaining differences in T r, establishing at best weak correlations to local environmental characteristics. In the present approach the process-based profile reference model is utilized to investigate the non-linear interactions between the hydrodynamic forcing and the morphodynamic profile response for two sites. Despite strong similarity in environmental conditions, the sites at Noordwijk and Egmond on the Holland coast exhibit distinctly different T r values. The detailed comparison of modelling results enables a consistent investigation of the role of specific parameters at a level of detail that could not have been achieved from observations alone, and provides insights into the mechanisms that govern T r. The results reveal that the bed slope at the barred zone is the most important parameter governing T r. As a bar migrates further offshore, a steeper slope results in a stronger relative increase in h Xb which reduces wave breaking and in turn reduces the offshore migration rate. The deceleration of the offshore migration rate as the bar moves to deeper water - the morphodynamic feedback loop - contrasts with the initial enhanced offshore migration behaviour of the bar. The initial behaviour is determined by the intense wave breaking associated with the steeper profile slope. These mechanisms explain the counter-intuitive observations at Egmond where Tr is significantly longer than at Noordwijk despite Egmond having the more energetic wave climate which typically reduces T r.   Input reduction for inter-annual advanced forward model applications  In order to avoid excessively long computation times, input reduction is imperative for the application of advanced forward morphodynamic area models to consider long-term (>years) predictions. Here, an input reduction framework for wave-dominated coastal settings is introduced. The framework comprises 4 steps, viz. (1) the selection of the duration of the original (full) time series of wave forcing, (2) the selection of the representative wave conditions, (3) the sequencing of these conditions, and (4) the time span after which the sequence is repeated. In step (2), the chronology of the original series is retained, while that is no longer the case in steps (3) and (4). We apply the framework to two different sites (Noordwijk, The Netherlands and Hasaki, Japan) with multiple nearshore sandbars but contrasting long-term offshore-directed behaviour: at Noordwijk the offshore migration is gradual and not coupled to individual storms, while at Hasaki the offshore migration is more episodic, and wave chronology appears to control the long-term evolution. The performance of the model with reduced wave climates is compared with a simulation with the actual (full) wave-forcing series. It is demonstrated that input reduction can dramatically affect long-term predictions, to such an extent that the main characteristics of the offshore bar cycle are no longer reproduced. This was the case at Hasaki, in particular, where all synthetic series that no longer retain the initial chronology (steps 3 and 4) lead to rather unrealistic long-term simulations. At Noordwijk, synthetic series can result in realistic behaviour, provided that the time span after which the sequence is repeated is not too large; the reduction of this time span has the same positive effect on the simulation as increasing the number of selected conditions in step 2. It is further demonstrated that, although storms result in the largest morphological change, conditions with low to intermediate wave energy must be retained to obtain realistic long-term sandbar behaviour. The input-reduction framework must be applied in an iterative fashion to obtain a reduced wave climate that is able to simulate long-term sandbar behaviour sufficiently accurately within an acceptable computation time. These results imply that it is essential to consider input reduction as an intrinsic part of any model set-up, calibration and validation effort. The study outcomes indicate clearly that a relatively simple model can be utilized to study the highly non-linear interaction between the nearshore hydrodynamics and morphology in great detail. This was achieved through carefully designed numerical experiments in which the influence of a specific process or environmental variable was isolated and identified. Although the model only considers cross-shore processes, the numerical experiments generated new insights into the importance of 3 D processes under particular morphological conditions of the nearshore barred profiles. Even though the model was successfully calibrated at Noordwijk, the application at Egmond showed a significantly reduced predictive capacity. The model was able to reproduce the main characteristics of the inter-annual bar morphodynamics, but the bar cycle return period was under-estimated by about 30 %. This suggests that the model can capture trends fairly well, but is unable to produce accurate absolute predictions - a finding that has broader implications. As stated earlier, accurate predictions of the long-term evolution of the nearshore barred profiles are generally considered indicative of the quality of the modelling of the entire nearshore coastal system. Consequently, further improvement of morphodynamic process-based models, particularly for the nearshore zone, constitutes a major research priority. Coastal Engineerin...|$|R

Recently it has been claimed that in isolated Y-shaped junctions that support vortex walls, selectivity is entirely determined by chirality (or topology), the suggestion being that vortex wall chirality is robust in the Walker breakdown process. Here we demonstrate that in Y-shaped junctions, magnetic switching in the important topologically protected regime exists only for a narrow window of field and bar geometry, {{and that it will}} be challenging to access this regime in field-driven ASI. This work has implications for the wider field of magnetic charge manipulation for high density memory storage...|$|R
40|$|In {{computer}} networks messages are transmitted through switches {{in order to}} reach destinations. Cross point switches are the simplest technique which requires one-to-one connection between input and output. The limitation of a cross <b>bar</b> <b>switch</b> technology is that if numbers of lines are large then cross point increases in huge amount consequently increasing the dimension of the switch. Space division switches are used to route the calls, which implies betterment over the cross bar technology. Actually it is built up of several smaller rectangular crossbars. This takes the advantage over the crossbar switches that less cross points are needed in the space division switches. The limitations of space division switches are that if more the number of cross points then there is increase the outgoing reaching probabilities of messages but the cost and overheads is also high with lesser cross points the congestion increases. In this paper we considered the architecture of a three crossbar space-division switch and assumed a Markov chain model for the transitional analysis of message flow. With the help of simulation study it is concluded that the impact of reaching probabilities for the different values of parameters must be kept in mind while designing this switch by designers...|$|R

40|$|High Speed Multi-Channel Fiber-Optic Transmitter (Tx) and Receiver (Rx) modules {{are needed}} for Army’s Ground Vehicle Applications. The fiber optic network should take {{advantage}} of the high speeds (10 Gbps/channel) and have the ability to connect multiple systems and sensors using a rugged fiber-optic network capable of working with 100 ’s of Gigabits of information. In addition, the network should provide redundant links between nodes so that in case one node goes out of service, the remainder of the network remains operational. In this paper we will present design, development and performance results for 1 x 12 Tx and Rx module operating at 10 Gbps/channel. Each of the 1 x 12 modules is capable of providing 120 Gbps/Module operations for Army’s Applications. Experimental results on 1 x 12 channel modules will include performance characteristics at 10 Gbps and will demonstrate high performance fiber-optical Tx and Rx Modules. We will also present architecture and simulation for a Fiber-Optic Network Card that has the capability to transmit and receive data, add and drop data at each node, and provide dual network redundancy. This network card includes Tx, Rx modules, serializer and de-serializer (SERDES) and a cross <b>bar</b> <b>switch.</b> This architecture {{can be used as a}} building block for high-speed local area network for the U.

40|$|The {{automotive}} domain {{is currently}} moving towards automated driver assistance applications, like automatic evasive maneuvers to avoid accidents, and even beyond assistance towards automated driving. However, {{in the near}} future these systems will only be active under certain conditions, thus still requiring manual control in other conditions. This means that there will be ‘transitions of control’: from the driver to the automated system and vice versa. Then research questions like ‘how should the system take over’, ‘how can the driver take back control’, and ‘can the driver be regarded as a backup if the system fails’, etc. arise. This paper addresses the effects of various parameters in handing back the control to the driver. This is done for TNO’s virtual tow bar system, which is an automated driving system that controls both the longitudinal and lateral vehicle motion at very close following for economic driving. This paper presents results of a driving simulator experiment executed with the aim to evaluate different parameters settings in <b>switching</b> the tow <b>bar</b> system on and off. Due to the short following distances and safety implications of this, there is be a procedure for hooking on / off of the tow bar system. Special attention is paid to driver behavior just after getting back control following a period of automated driving...|$|R
40|$|Specifies if a bar will {{be drawn}} at the plot points of each trace on {{subsequent}} plots. DESCRIPTION DATAPLOT can draw a trace as a character or plot symbol at each point, as a connected line, as a spike from the point to a base, as a bar from the plot point to a base, or as some combination of the above. The choice {{is determined by the}} BAR, SPIKE, CHARACTER, and LINE commands. The switches for these commands work independently so that a plot point can be any combination of these (or even none of them). The <b>BAR</b> <b>switch</b> is most commonly used to generate bar charts. The following types of bar charts are commonly used in business and presentation graphics: 1. Standard bar charts (a bar is drawn from the data point to the X axis); 2. Grouped bar charts (bars are drawn for 2 or more groups of data); 3. Stacked (or divided) bar charts (the bar is divided into several intervals). All of these formats are possible using DATAPLOT. At least one example of each of these formats is given in the PROGRAM section. DATAPLOT provides commands to control the various aspects of the bar (see the RELATED COMMANDS section). Many of these are also demonstrated with the sample programs. Many analysts prefer that bar charts be drawn vertically rather than horizontally. This is straightforward to do and is demonstrated with the sample programs...|$|R
5000|$|The {{third year}} of production, 1969, brought several new {{additions}} to the Cougar lineup. A convertible model was now available in either standard and XR-7 trim. The grille <b>switched</b> from vertical <b>bars</b> to horizontal bars. Tail lights still spanned the entire rear {{of the car and}} retained vertical chrome dividers, but were now concave rather than convex. Body sides now featured a prominent line that swept downward from the nose to just ahead of the rear wheel wells. A new performance package appeared. The GT, XR-7G, and 7.0-L GT-E were discontinued, but the 390 and 428 V8s remained. The 302 engines were dropped, except for the [...] "Boss" [...] version, available only with the Eliminator package. The new standard Cougar engine was a 250-horsepower 351 Windsor. A [...] 351 Windsor V8 was also added to the engine lineup. The Eliminator performance package appeared for the first time. A 351 cuin L four-barrel Windsor V8 was standard, with the 390 four-barrel V8, the 428CJ, and the Boss 302 available as options. The Eliminator also featured a blacked-out grille, special side stripes, front and rear spoilers, an optional Ram Air induction system, a full gauge package including tachometer, upgraded [...] "Decor" [...] interior trim, special high-back bucket seats, rally wheels, raised white letter tires, and a performance-tuned suspension and handling package. It also came in vibrant colors, such as white, bright blue metallic, competition orange, and bright yellow. Only two Cougars were produced with the Boss 429 V8 as factory drag cars for [...] "Fast Eddie" [...] Schartman and [...] "Dyno" [...] Don Nicholson. A 1969-only package was the Cougar Sports Special that included unique pin striping, [...] "turbine" [...] style wheel covers, and rocker panel moldings with simulated side scoops. Décor interior and performance suspension were available for the Sports Special, as were any of the optional Cougar engines, other than the Boss 302. No badges or decals denoted the Sports Special option on either the interior or exterior.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} 75 mi of the Utah Northern Railroad (later named Utah & Northern Railway) {{was conceived}} and {{built by the}} Mormons. It was a [...] narrow gauge spur off the Union Pacific portion of the transcontinental railroad. The labor for this railroad was largely volunteer Mormon labor as {{the intent of the}} railroad was to serve the Mormon communities in the Cache Valley that had been settled almost entirely by the Mormons. It was a case of Mormons forming a company and building their own railroad because existing railroad companies showed no interest in building such a railroad. [...] The northern half of the Cache Valley is in Idaho and, due to claims and disputes by the Shoshone and Bannock Indians, was not settled by the Mormons until after the Bear River Massacre and subsequent Fort Bridger Treaty of 1868 that forced the Shoshone and Bannock onto reservations. [...] The original Mormon plan for the Utah Northern was to build a railroad to the communities in the Cache Valley and about 60 mi into Idaho to Soda Springs, Idaho that lies in a valley beyond called the Bear River Valley. This was by dictate of Brigham Young as he owned land in Soda Springs and believed that the Bear River Valley had potential for further Mormon settlement. [...] The Mormons also believed they could break the monopoly that the anti-Mormon town of Corinne, Utah had on the wagon freight business on the Montana Trail by extending the railroad into Idaho. [...] There were tentative plans to eventually extend the Utah Northern to Montana. The road was constructed northward from the Union Pacific line at Ogden commencing construction on August 24, 1871. In three years, the largely volunteer railroad company had built only 75 mi of road. It reached Franklin, Idaho, just across the Idaho border, in May 1874 where construction was halted. Investors had become hesitant after the panic of 1873 and the railroad was now moving into the northern half of the Cache Valley where there were many fewer Mormon volunteers due to this area only recently having been relinquished by the Bannock and Shoshone. Poor decisions by the planners and the lack of business from the frugal residents of the Cache Valley led to the bankruptcy and foreclosure sale of the Utah Northern only a few years later in 1878.It would be the robber baron Jay Gould who would transform the Utah Northern. He and Union Pacific acquired the Utah Northern Railroad, changing the name to the Utah & Northern Railway and infusing the railroad with capital. [...] Big business knew that an electrical age was coming and that the demand for copper <b>switches,</b> copper <b>bars,</b> copper fittings, and most importantly, copper wire was putting a charge on copper prices. [...] They also knew that there were rich copper deposits at the mines near Butte, Montana. Union Pacific wasted no time and resumed construction on the Utah & Northern Railway immediately after purchase in April 1878. In fact, Jay Gould invested personal money to get some construction started just beyond Franklin in the fall of 1877. [...] The new plan was not to build the road to Soda Springs, however, but to build a much longer road on a direct route through the Cache Valley, then north across eastern Idaho and north across western Montana to Butte, Montana. In the first year of construction, they reached Eagle Rock (now Idaho Falls, Idaho), 120 mi north of the Utah/Idaho border, where they built a bridge across the Snake River in early 1879. [...] In the second year, they added another 90 mi of track and crossed the continental divide at the Idaho/Montana border. After {{three and a half years}} of construction, before the close of 1881, they completed the additional 120 mi of road to Butte, Montana. Butte soon grew to be the largest copper producing city in the world and Butte's population, by some estimates, grew to nearly 100,000 residents for a time, making Butte, with its [...] "Copper Kings," [...] the second largest city in the West with more influence than Salt Lake City, Denver, Sacramento, Seattle, or Portland. Only San Francisco remained larger and more important. Butte, with its large-scale mining and smelting operations, was dubbed the Pittsburg of the West.|$|R
40|$|Kiteboarding is {{an ocean}} sport wherein the participant, {{also known as}} a kiter, uses a large {{inflatable}} bow shaped kite to plane across the ocean on a surfboard or wakeboard. The rider is connected to his or her kite via a control bar system. This control system allows the kiter to steer the kite and add or remove power from the kite, in order to change direction and increase or decrease speed. This senior project focused on creating a new control bar system to replace a control bar system manufactured by a kiteboarding company, Liquid Force. The current Liquid Force control bar has two main faults, extraneous components and a lack of ergonomic design. Our team aimed to eliminate unneeded components and create a more ergonomic bar. By eliminating components, the bar would also be more cost effective to produce by using less material and requiring less time to manufacture. We first conducted a literature review into the areas of kiteboarding control systems and handle ergonomics. Based on studies done on optimal grip diameters for reducing forearm stress we concluded that the diameter for the bar grip should be at least a centimeter less than the maximum grip of the user. In addition to the literature review we conducted our own ergonomics surveys on fellow kite surfers regarding their preference towards the shape of the grip. Using ANOVA analysis, we found that riders preferred a bar with a less square center, but no clear preference on an oval shape versus a circular shape, so we decided on circular to minimize manufacturing and material costs. A functional decomposition was then employed on the current bar and a QFD analysis of each component was conducted. We found that 33 % of the components composed the plastic bar end swivel. We decided to remove the swivel system due to its lack of use and ergonomics. We then began the design process on the new bar ends and bar center. We went through two iterations of a smaller square center, choosing a center with chamfered edges to blend with the grip material. Our bar end design went through four iterations ranging from a simple angular boxy look, to a curved design which was more aesthetically and ergonomically pleasing. With SolidWorks models in hand, Mastercam toolpaths were built by our technical advisor, and we machined the bar ends and center out of aluminum billet. For the grip tubing we used carbon fiber tubing. By the end of manufacturing we had three different length bars to test in the ocean and we had reduced the bar part count from 31 parts to 13 parts. To justify the bars we created in terms of cost, we conducted economic comparisons between our bar design and the current bar. We concluded that Liquid Force would save $ 26, 105. 87 per year in labor and materials by <b>switching</b> to our <b>bar</b> and using casting processes for manufacturing. Due to the economic advantage and the new ergonomic design, we feel that Liquid Force should implement the design after further testing and refining. The bar performed without fault in our ocean test session, but we did find that improvements could be made in terms of grip ergonomics; the carbon surface was usable, but an EVA grip would give the user a softer, less slippery surface to steer with. We recommend that more long term testing be done to insure that the glue does not de-bond over time and that the carbon aluminum interface does not corrode. Continuing the project, we will research grip materials such as EVA, and create over molded bar grips and bar end covers...|$|R
