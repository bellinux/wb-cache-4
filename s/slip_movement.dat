50|$|When the {{subduction}} zone ceased about 55 million years ago, the Farallon Plate was {{split into two}} distinctive plates which can still be observed today as the Juan de Fuca Plate and the Cocos Plate. Both {{were part of the}} same plate, but were discovered independently before this connection was made. At the time of this break off, the Pacific Plate had a general north west movement while the North American Plate had a general south east movement. This created a new fault zone when a weak point gave way between these two plates. This is the beginnings of the infamous San Andreas Fault. The San Andreas Fault is a right-lateral strike strip transverse fault. When this fault was just created, a volcano from the ancient {{subduction zone}} was situated about 3/4th on the Pacific Plate and 1/4th on the North American plate somewhere in what is today Central California. Nearly 55 million years later, this volcano was offset by about 250 miles. It is the largest known offset of the San Andreas Fault and it help geologist determine important information such as average <b>slip</b> <b>movement</b> and the age of the fault.

The validation {{of the sense of}} movement, location and orientation of the shear zones was done by field mapping. The general orientation of all shear zones was NW-SE. The sense of movement along the Neusspruit, Boven Rugzeer and Trooilapspan shear zones was found to be dextral strike <b>slip</b> <b>movement</b> and the Cnydas shear zone had a sinistral strike <b>slip</b> <b>movement.</b> The location of the shear zones were determined by analyzing the deviation in general foliation trend which was visualized using Rose Diagrams.

The oblique collision of the Namaqua-Natal crustal block with the Kaapvaal Craton during the orogenic event at ~ 1. 2 Ga created a compressionalgeotectonic setting which allowed for the intrusion of the early to late syn-tectonic Keimoes Suite granites. The lateral escape of the Namaqua-Natal crustal block took place along the western margin of the Kaapvaal Craton. This was brought on by prolonged compression which resulted in the formation of a releasing bend in the Namaqua Region. This releasing bend produced the negative flower structure with dextral shear zones which facilitated the intrusion of the post-tectonic Keimoes Suite granites...|$|E

Cenozoic basins in northern Thailand are mainly N-S-trending graben and half-graben with sediments ranging in thickness from 1, 000 to 3, 000 m (Polachan et al., 1991).

30|$|We {{analyzed}} GNSS data {{in southwest}} Japan {{and found a}} concentrated deformation zone along the coastline of the Japan Sea between 132.5 °E and 135 °E. This zone {{is a part of}} the Northern Chugoku Shear Zone based on a seismological and geological study (Gutscher and Lallemand 1999). This study has first identified the concentrated shear zone in the San-in area geodetically, and we propose to call the concentrated deformation zone the San-in shear zone (SSZ), which accommodates a right-lateral strike <b>slip</b> <b>movement</b> with a width of ~ 50  km. A simple dislocation model of vertical dextral fault with a shallow locking and a deep creeping of ~ 5  mm/year reproduces the observed velocity pattern across the SSZ. Although the SSZ is characterized by active shallow microseismicity, each cluster of microseismicity and faults ruptured by recent large earthquakes are almost oriented in NNW–SSE which is oblique to the overall trend of the SSZ. We propose the oblique seismicity is attributed to conjugate Riedel shears in a young developing shear zone. From the view point of regional tectonics, it is proposed that the SSZ is a shear zone for strain partitioning within the southern margin of the continental Amurian plate and accommodates a part of relative motion of the subducting Philippine Sea plate.|$|E

The incised valley was fed by a paleo Tocantins River, which deposited its sediment load continuously to the north-northwest, reaching the Marajó Island and producing a deposit with a fan-morphology during the Plio-Pleistocene/Pleistocene.

Also, mechanical damage of a sample surface can be monitored with monolayer resolution [1]. The laws which determine the dependence of friction on normal load or velocity [2, 3] differ from the ones we have learned to describe macroscopic friction. For small scales, a regime of ultra-low friction has been suggested and experimentally realized [4]. The characteristic atomic stick-slip instability in friction force measurements is caused by the jump of the contacting tip from one atomic position to the next. The occurrence of such stickslip behavior is one-to-one related to energy loss in the sliding process, since the high velocity during the <b>slip</b> <b>movement</b> causes significant dissipation.

40|$|The NE-SW and N-S trending, Bjørnøyrenna Fault Complex is {{obviously}} belongs to an extensional regime. It {{is comprised of}} three main master faults (MF 1, MF 2 & MF 3) in the study area. This large array of master faults further characterized by different segments termed as (MF 1 a, MF 1 b; MF 2 a, MF 2 b; MF 3 a, MF 3 b & MF 3 c) which constitute linked fault system with variable soft-linked and hard-linked elements. In a cross-sectional view, the fault geometries exhibit a distinct contrast between deepest (late Carboniferous-early Permian) and shallowest (intra Triassic -Cretaceous) stratigraphic levels. On the basis of regional significance and thick skin nature, MFCP 1 qualified as a “First class” fault. On the other hand, MF 1 & MF 2 are not basement involved but shows reactivation with time and exhibits a regional significance. Therefore, it could be termed as a combination of “First or Second class” fault. Subsequently, the fault complex is subdivided into platform and sub platform {{on the basis of}} intrinsic fault frequency, pattern and dip dimensions of the reflection packages. On the platform, the fault at deeper level MFCP 1 is characterized by planar fault geometry whereas; MF 1 at shallowest level is dominated by strong listric configuration. Additionally, relatively simple listric detachment has been recognized within Permian succession. However, rotated fault blocks geometry has been recognized along planar normal faults (MF 2 a & MF 2 b) in sub platform. Fault dating was performed by using the methods of expansion growth index and recognition of syn-rift sedimentation. On the behalf of these methods, the N-S striking, MFCP 1 was active in the late Carboniferous-early Permian whereas, NE-SW striking master fault MF 2 a & MF 2 b demonstrates an age of mid/late Jurassic – early Cretaceous. Moreover, an age of MF 1 could be younger than the intra Triassic. An evidence of positive structural inversion is recognized in the present study. The analysis of such feature suggests that the strike <b>slip</b> <b>movement</b> could be responsible for the generation of this mild inversion. Therefore, an age of inversion structure can be related to the late Jurassic to the early Cretaceous. The evolution of the Bjørnøyrenna Fault Complex was started in late Carboniferous-early Permian. The late Permian-early Triassic period was characterized by the uplift of the Loppa high and significant subsidence recognized in the fault complex. The mid-late Triassic period was characterized by growth faulting. The mid Jurassic-early Cretaceous time was marked by an extensive uplifting followed by tremendous erosion of sediments.

Geological evidence for these movements can be found onshore both on North Greenland and Svalbard. However, the role of the submarine Yermak Plateau in this process is quite speculative. New multi-channel seismic (10 km spacing) and aeromagnetic data (7. 5 km spacing) across the north-western part of the plateau show that the acoustic basement strikes in similar direction as the geological units onshore Svalbard do. A prominent fault zone separates these most likely continental structures in the west from a more N-S extended transitional crustal block {{in the eastern part of}} the plateau. This north-eastern part of the plateau is characterized by strong magnetic anomalies, which at least indicate highly intruded, and stretched continental or even oceanic crust. Furthermore, the seismic data show, that the plateau-like bathymetry is quite young. During most of its Cainozoic history the Yermak Plateau had a rough topography, similar to the recent topography onshore Spitsbergen.

The area has complex tectonics due to interaction of Indian, Eurasian and Arabian plates. Both thrust and strike slip earthquakes are dominant {{in this region}} with minor, localized normal faulting events. This earthquake under consideration (Dalbadin Earthquake) posed constraints in depth and focal parameters {{due to lack of}} data for evaluation of parameters from Pakistan, Iran or Afghanistan region. Normal faulting mechanism has been proposed by many researchers for this earthquake. In the present study the earthquake was relocated using the technique of travel time residuals. Relocated coordinates and depth were utilized to calculate the focal mechanism solution with outcome of a dominant strike slip mechanism, which is contrary to normal faulting. Relocated coordinates and resulting mechanism are more reliable than many reporting agencies as evaluation in this study is augmented by data from local seismic monitoring network of Pakistan. The tectonics in the area is governed by active subduction along the Makran Subduction Zone. This particular earthquake has strike slip mechanism due to breaking of subducting oceanic plate. This earthquake is located where oceanic lithosphere is subducting along with relative movements between Lut and Helmand blocks. Magnitude of this event i. e.

40|$|Residents of Maxwell Hill, {{a suburb}} of Beckley, West Virginia, {{reported}} from January until March of 1988 a series of earth tremors. The tremors rattled dishes, and the noises associated with tremors were sometimes loud enough to wake people at night. These events were puzzling because Beckley is {{in an area of}} low seismic activity. Maxwell Hill is located above abandoned coal mines, though no direct subsidence damage to surface structures has been documented. A research program was initiated to determine whether subsurface ground movements associated with the abandoned mines could be responsible for the seismic activity experienced at the surface. A hypothesis is proposed which states that seismic disturbances can be caused by abandoned mine failure when two conditions are met. First, some instability must exist at the mine level. The most likely cause of instability is the failure of pillars of coal that were left for support at the time of mining. Second, subsurface movements can result in significant seismic activity only when the rock above the mine contains at least one very strong and brittle layer that is prone to fail violently through rupture or fault <b>slip</b> <b>movement.</b> Analysis of the data indicates that both hypothesized conditions for mine-related seismicity appear to have been satisfied in the case of Maxwell Hill. It has therefore been concluded that the earth tremors experienced by Maxwell Hill residents probably are related to the abandoned mines. Analysis of the potential magnitude of these events indicates that they are unlikely to cause significant surface danlage. The probability that future events will disturb the residence of Maxwell Hill should be quite low based on the identified mechanism...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe present {{analysis}} of the spatial correlations of seismological slip maps and fault topography roughness, illuminating their identical self-affine exponent. Though {{the complexity of the}} coseismic spatial slip distribution can be intuitively associated with geometrical or stress heterogeneities along the fault surface, this has never been demonstrated. Based on new measurements of fault surface topography and on statistical analyses of kinematic inversions of slip maps, we propose a model, which quantitatively characterizes the link between slip distribution and fault surface roughness. Our approach can be divided into two complementary steps: (i) Using a numerical computation, we estimate the influence of fault roughness on the frictional strength (pre-stress). We model a fault as a rough interface where elastic asperities are squeezed. The Hurst exponent inline image, characterizing the self-affinity of the frictional strength field, approaches inline image, where inline image is the roughness exponent of the fault surface in the direction of slip. (ii) Using a quasi-static model of fault propagation, which includes the effect of long-range elastic interactions and spatial correlations in the frictional strength, the spatial slip correlation is observed to scale as inline image, where inline image represents the Hurst exponent of the slip distribution. Under the assumption that the origin of the spatial fluctuations in frictional strength along faults is the elastic squeeze of fault asperities, we show that self-affine geometrical properties of fault surface roughness control slip correlations and that inline image. Given that inline image for a wide range of faults (various accumulated displacement, host rock and <b>slip</b> <b>movement),</b> we predict that inline image. Even if our quasi-static fault model is more relevant for creeping faults, the spatial slip correlations observed are consistent with those of seismological slip maps.

30|$|The SSZ locates along a {{volcanic}} {{front of the}} subducting Philippine Sea plate. Low velocity of seismic waves in upper mantle beneath the SSZ and a high 3 He/ 4 He ratio suggest upwelling fluid from the mantle in the SSZ (Nakajima and Hasegawa, 2007; Sano and Nakajima 2008). These observations suggest that the fluid weaken the lower crust (i.e., Iio et al. 2002). High temperature induced from high heat flow (Tanaka et al. 2004) and the shallow cutoff depth of seismicity (Omuralieva et al. 2012) also contribute to weaken the lower crust in the SSZ. Oblique subduction of the Philippine Sea can drive the aseismic faulting or ductile flow in the weakened lower crust examined by Kawanishi et al. (2009) and this study. We propose that the SSZ is a shear zone for strain partitioning within the continental plate and accommodates a part of relative motion between the subducting Philippine Sea and the overriding continental plates, as suggested by previous studies (Tsukuda 1992; Gutscher and Lallemand 1999; Gutscher 2001). Although the concentration zone of strain rates observed by GNSS is limited between 132.7 °E and 135.2 °E, similar movements probably extend to east and west. Because we do not identify the concentrated deformation in eastern and western extensions on land, we speculate that right-lateral strike <b>slip</b> <b>movements</b> are more diffusive in the extensions and are accommodated mainly in an offshore region.|$|R
40|$|The complex {{development}} of the northern Crotone Basin, a forearc basin of the Calabrian Arc (Southern Italy), has been documented by sedimentological, stratigraphic and structural analyses. This Mediterranean-type fault bounded basin consists of small depocentres commonly characterized by a mix of facies that grades from continental to shallow marine. The lower Pliocene in¢ll of the Crotone Basin consists of o¡shore marls (Cavalieri Marl) that grade upwards into a shallow-marine to continentalsuccessionupto 850 mthick(ZingaFormation). Thesuccessionissubdividedintothree mainstratalunits:Zinga 1,Zinga 2,Zinga 3 boundedbymajorunconformities. TheZinga 1 stratalunit grades from the Cavalieri Marl to deltaic and shoreface deposits, the latter organized into several stacked progradational wedges that show spectacular thickness changes and progressive unconformities related to salt-cored NE-trending growth folds and listric normal faults. The Zinga 2 stratal unit records a progressive and moderate deepening of the area, marked by £uvial sedimentation at the base, followed by lagoonal deposits and by a stacking of mixed bioclastic and siliciclastic shoreface units, organized into metre-scale high-frequency cycles. Deposition was controlled by NE- trending synsedimentary normal faults that dissected the basin {{into a series of}} half-grabens. Hangingwall stratigraphic expansion was compensated by footwall condensed sedimentation. The extensional tectonic regime continued during sedimentation of the Zinga 3 stratal unit. Deposition con¢ned within structural lows during a generalized transgressive phase led to local enhancement of tidal £ows and {{development of}} sand-wave trains. The tectonic setting testi¢es the generalized structural domain of a forearc region. The angular unconformity {{at the top of the}} Zinga 3 stratal unit is regional, and marks the activation of a large- scale tectonic phase linked to strike- <b>slip</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R
