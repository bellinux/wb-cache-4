For the study of acute toxicity, a single oral dose of 5, 000 mg/kg body weight was administered in rats (five females, five males). The results showed no signs of toxicity such as general behavior change, mortality, or change in gross appearance of internal organs. <b>Subchronic</b> <b>toxicity</b> was studied by daily oral doses (ten females, ten males) of 300, 600 and 1, 200 mg/kg body weight for consecutive 90 days. The satellite group was treated with the extract at the dose of 1, 200 mg/kg/day for 90 days and kept for other 28 days after treatment.

30|$|Perfluorinated {{compounds}} [PFCs] {{have found}} a wide use in industrial products and processes and in {{a vast array of}} consumer products. PFCs are molecules made up of carbon chains to which fluorine atoms are bound. Due to the strength of the carbon/fluorine bond, the molecules are chemically very stable and are highly resistant to biological degradation; therefore, they belong to a class of compounds that tend to persist in the environment. These compounds can bioaccumulate and also undergo biomagnification. Within the class of PFC chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorosulphonic acid are generally considered reference substances. Meanwhile, PFCs can be detected almost ubiquitously, e.g., in water, plants, different kinds of foodstuffs, in animals such as fish, birds, in mammals, as well as in human breast milk and blood. PFCs are proposed as a new class of 'persistent organic pollutants'. Numerous publications allude to the negative effects of PFCs on human health. The following review describes both external and internal exposures to PFCs, the toxicokinetics (uptake, distribution, metabolism, excretion), and the toxicodynamics (acute <b>toxicity,</b> subacute and <b>subchronic</b> <b>toxicities,</b> chronic toxicity including carcinogenesis, genotoxicity and epigenetic effects, reproductive and developmental toxicities, neurotoxicity, effects on the endocrine system, immunotoxicity and potential modes of action, combinational effects, and epidemiological studies on perfluorinated compounds).|$|R

Aims: To study the acute and 28 -day toxicity effects of mangiferin in rodents. Methods: Single doses of mangiferin were administered by oral or i. p. route or were applied dermally to Sprague-Dawley rats and Balb/C mice. Clinical symptoms of animals were observed during 14 days after treatment. Animals also received single oral doses daily for 28 consecutive days. Blood biochemistry, hematology and pathology findings were reported. Results: In the acute study, no toxic effects were observed after dermal exposure to mangiferin 2000 mg/kg but transient dyspnea, flank position and piloerection were observed after oral administration to this xanthone. I. p. administration induced similar toxicity signs, but at the highest dose (2000 mg/kg) all mice, one female rat and one male rat died. Rats orally treated with mangiferin (250 - 1000 mg/kg) for 28 days did not show any abnormal clinical signs or hematology alterations, when compared to control group animals.

The only unexpected and significant toxic effect was elicited by ClO 2; this chemical inhibited thyroid metabolism in the animals at a dose of ca. 9. 0 mg/kg/day. A statistically significant decrease of serum thyroxine occurred after the fourth week of exposure to 100 mg/l. concentration. The extent of thyroid suppression was dose dependent in each individual monkey, and was reversible after cessation of exposure. NaClO 2 and NaClO 3 failed to elicit similar effects in doses up to ca. 60 mg/kg/day. Also, NaClO 4 or NH 2 Cl did not cause T- 4 suppression in doses of 10 mg/kg/day.

The bioaccumulation of fipronil in earthworm tissues was also enantioselective, with a preferential accumulation of S-fipronil, and the enantiomer fraction was approximately 0. 56 - 0. 60. During soil exposure, fipronil was transformed primarily into fipronil sulfide, sulfone and amide, and E. foetida rapidly accumulated fipronil and sulfone. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates the enantioselective <b>subchronic</b> <b>toxicity</b> and bioaccumulation of enantiomers of fipronil in E. foetida. The earthworm tissues exhibited a relative enrichment of fipronil and fipronil sulfone, and these compounds might biomagnify (with a biota-to-soil accumulation factor of >= 1. 0 kg(oc) kg(lip) (- 1)), allowing for the possible trophic transfer and/or lip bioaccumulation of all these chemicals if earthworms were consumed by predator organisms.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} potential acute and <b>subchronic</b> <b>toxicity</b> of rhodium (II) citrate in female Balb/c mice after intraperitoneal injections. In the acute test, independent groups received five doses; the highest dose (107. 5 mg/kg) was equivalent to 33 times that {{used in our}} previous reports. The other doses were chosen as proportions of the highest, being 80. 7 (75 %), 53. 8 (50 %), 26. 9 (25 %) or 13. 8 mg/kg (12. 5 %). Animals were monitored over 38 days and no severe signs of toxicity were observed, according to mortality, monitoring of adverse symptoms, hematological, biochemical and genotoxic parameters. We conclude that the median lethal dose (LD 50) could be greater than 107. 5 mg/kg. In the subchronic test, five doses of Rh 2 Cit (80, 60, 40, 20 or 10 mg/kg) were evaluated and injections were conducted on alternate days, totaling five applications per animal. Paclitaxel (57. 5 mg/kg) and saline solution were controls. Clinical observations, histopathology of liver, lung and kidneys and effects on hematological, biochemistry and genotoxic records indicated that Rh 2 Cit induced no severe toxic effects, even at an accumulated dose up to 400 mg/kg. We suggest Rh 2 Cit has great potential as an antitumor drug without presenting acute and <b>subchronic</b> <b>toxicity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Chondroitin sulfate, an amino sugar polymer made of {{glucuronic acid}} and N-acetyl-galactosamine, {{is used in}} dietary {{supplements}} to promote joint health. Commonly used chondroitin sulfate is of animal origin and can pose potential safety problems including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate potential adverse effects, if any, of microbial derived chondroitin sulfate sodium (CSS) in <b>subchronic</b> <b>toxicity,</b> genotoxicity and bioavailability studies. In the toxicity study, Sprague Dawley rats (10 /sex/group) were gavaged with CSS at dose levels of 0, 250, 500 and 1000  mg/kg body weight (bw) /day for 90 -days. No mortality or significant changes in clinical signs, body weights, body weight gain or feed consumption were noted. Similarly, no toxicologically relevant treatment-related changes in hematological, clinical chemistry, urinalysis and organ weights were noted. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations did not reveal treatment-related abnormalities. In vitro mutagenic and clastogenic potentials as evaluated by Ames assay, chromosomal aberration test and micronucleus assay did not reveal genotoxicity of CSS. In pharmacokinetic study in human, CSS showed higher absorption as compared to chondroitin sulfate of animal origin. The results of <b>subchronic</b> <b>toxicity</b> study supports the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for CSS as 1000  mg/kg bw/day, the highest dose tested...|$|E
40|$|After a brief {{recall of}} {{toxicological}} data about germanium compounds, the authors relate subacute and <b>subchronic</b> oral <b>toxicities</b> of beta bis carboxyethyl-germanium sesquioxide in rats. During 28 days and six months, {{male and female}} animals have received 1 mg/kg/day. No particular toxic symptoms, no behaviour trouble except a small decrease of body weight, in male rats, {{at the end of}} the 6 -month experimentation, were observed. A light decrease of erythropoiesis and a general stimulation of cellular metabolism has been noticed after 28 days. The only marked effect was a moderate renal deficiency characterized by a tubular disease with presence of cylinders, swelling of tubulus cells and floculus amounts after 6 months. Germanium urinary excretion was constant and linked to the received dose. Six months later, no preferential accumulation in organs was observe...|$|R
5000|$|Release of Gd3+ {{from the}} complex {{is said to}} be {{responsible}} for the toxicity associated with gadolinium complexes; this release appears to be a consequence of Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ca2+ transmetallation in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by 1) acute toxicity experiments, which demonstrate that despite a 50-fold range of LD50 values for four Gd complexes, all become lethally toxic when they release precisely the same quantity of Gd3+, and 2) by <b>subchronic</b> rodent <b>toxicity</b> experiments, which demonstrate a set of gross and microscopic findings similar to those known to be caused by Zn2+ deficiency. A recent review takes the question of toxicity caused by loss of gadolinium from the complex. [...] "The challenge for nephrologists includes (a) evidence of transmetallation, such as gadolinium deposits in bone, increased urinary zinc excretion, iron-transferrin dissociation or 'spurious hypocalcemia' in exposed people" ...|$|R
