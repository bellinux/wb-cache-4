500|$|Minogue {{ventured into}} music during her {{time on the}} show and her cover of [...] "The Loco-Motion" [...] spent several weeks {{at the top of the}} Australian music chart. In late 1987, Minogue flew to England to record [...] "I Should Be So Lucky", before {{returning}} home to continue with Neighbours. The press speculated that she would soon have to make a decision between acting and singing. Shortly after, Minogue chose to concentrate on her burgeoning music career and decided to leave Neighbours after two and a half years. She filmed her final scenes in June 1988. Charlene's exit storyline saw her move to Brisbane, after her grandfather, Dan (Syd Conabere), bought her and Scott a house there. Scott was initially unable to go with his wife, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> goodbye to him, on the understanding that he would join her as soon as he could get a job transfer. All of the cast gathered in the street, while Charlene said goodbye to her brother, mother and friends. She then got into her green Mini and drove out of Ramsay Street.|$|E
500|$|Federal {{district}} judge David L. Bunning of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, the judge {{assigned to the}} cases, held hearings with Davis in Ashland, at which {{she was the only}} witness. Davis argued tearfully that issuing licenses under her name violated her beliefs, citing her religious rights under the First Amendment: [...] "It wasn't just a spur-of-the-moment decision", she said. [...] "It was thought out, and I sought God on it." [...] Davis had already decided against resigning from her post, as doing <b>so,</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> would only leave the matter to her deputies: [...] "If I resign, I solve nothing. It helps nobody." [...] Governor Beshear stated that he would not call a special session of the General Assembly to address Davis' concerns, while other state legislators believed that such a session could accommodate Davis with possible new legislation. Davis' attorneys, from the Maitland, Florida-based law firm Liberty Counsel, stated that the plaintiffs were free to drive to other counties to obtain their same-sex marriage licenses, with one adding, [...] "This case is not about these plaintiffs' desires to get married, the case is about [...] desire to force Kim Davis to approve and authorize their marriage in violation of her constitutionally protected religious beliefs." [...] Davis and her attorneys then sued Governor Beshear for ordering her to violate her religious beliefs instead of trying to accommodate them, arguing that Beshear, not Davis, should be held accountable for any legal damages from the ACLU lawsuit.|$|E
2500|$|Like the NUWSS, {{the more}} militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) led by Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst chose to cease their obstructive {{activism}} for women's votes and instead advocated the alignment of British {{women to the}} cause of war. However, in October 1914, Sylvia Pankhurst travelled to Glasgow and spoke out against the war, becoming one of the first suffragettes to do <b>so.</b> <b>She</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "peace must be made by the people and not by the diplomats." [...] Though pacifist, Pankhurst held with her mother and sister to the general agreement that suffragettes would abstain from militant activism for the duration—she arranged for activist women to join with the War Emergency Worker’s Committee and fill some of the positions that had been abandoned by men leaving for war.|$|E
60|$|Miss Nugent {{thanked him}} warmly; {{he seemed to}} {{understand}} her <b>so</b> well, <b>she</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear Humfrey, you are <b>so</b> good!' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{struck with}} his kind resignation, and utter absence of acerbity in his disappointment.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I am <b>so</b> glad!' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> as caresses passed--which {{might have}} been those of mother and {{daughter}} for heartfelt sympathy and affection.|$|R
2500|$|Björk {{has since}} {{stated that the}} album was not [...] "hip hop" [...] {{and that she had}} not {{intended}} for it to be <b>so.</b> <b>She</b> <b>said</b> that {{she did not want to}} work with Timbaland as a [...] "hitmaker", or because of his affiliation to a particular genre, but wanted to work with him solely as a musician in his own right. Björk has also explained that when the two of them were together, Timbaland asked Björk what kind of music she would like to make with him, for example a hit song or [...] "something weird", and Björk replied that she was interested in finding out where they [...] "overlapped" [...] musically, and they would go from there. The result was a tribal sound, because they were both interested in it. She has also said that One Little Indian [...] "always feel that ‘my latest release is the most commercial to date’", and that she feels Volta is no more commercial than any of her previous work.|$|E
60|$|Alice didn't want {{to begin}} another argument, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> nothing.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> and I wondered, feeling trammelled and hurt. It did {{not make}} me free.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, if I do, I sha'n't {{leave the}} light; <b>so</b> there!' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> spitefully, and, taking the lamp, left Mr Clinton in darkness.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aren't they beautiful? I think they're <b>so</b> beautiful,' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> moving {{close to}} Birkin, and {{pointing}} to the red filaments with her long, white finger.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ssh! not <b>so</b> loud,' <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> 'Nobody knows I {{carry it}} with me. They {{think it is}} in papa's treasury. That is where it {{generally}} is.' ...|$|R
60|$|Jennie was {{completely}} bewildered, {{and had no}} opinion on the subject whatever; <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> nothing.|$|E
6000|$|This speech frightened the woman. It wouldn't do {{to provoke}} Uncle John, however {{unreasonable}} {{he happened to}} be. <b>So</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> meekly: ...|$|E
6000|$|Trot {{thought the}} pretty Queen was their friend, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Of course you'll have the {{deciding}} vote, then, you being the Ruler." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{have nothing}} nearly <b>so</b> valuable,” <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> “Well, now, {{you must take}} up your abode with us while you stay here. How long have you?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you <b>so</b> much,' <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> 'It will do very nicely. Thank you <b>so</b> much.' Then <b>she</b> {{turned to}} Birkin, saying {{with a little}} gay movement: 'Shall we do it now, Rupert?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am grown <b>so</b> silly' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{trying to}} smile. 'I hardly even {{understood}} last night;' {{and the voice}} died away in the intense desire to hear.|$|R
6000|$|The {{object with}} which {{she put on her}} hat was to go to Aaron's cottage, to congratulate Elspeth. <b>So</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> to herself. Oh, Grizel! ...|$|E
6000|$|Ida nearly {{fell off}} her perch in her amazement. The only words {{of which she}} could think were [...] "My {{goodness}} me!" [...] <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> them.|$|E
6000|$|The instant that Ada's eyes fell on Glumm her active brain {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} treating him to a disappointment, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> hurriedly to her friend: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did not {{calculate}} upon being <b>so</b> long,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> sweetly, at {{the same}} time throwing back her face and smiling. 'But I--was longer than I expected.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I did {{not think}} it could be <b>so</b> fine-fingered,' <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> <b>She</b> breathed on the glass bulb till it looked like a dim {{magnolia}} bud; she inhaled its fine savour.|$|R
6000|$|The {{old lady}} was rapidly giving way, {{but she did}} not like to do it all at once; <b>so</b> <b>she</b> only <b>said,</b> 'Ah! I can't hear him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>so.</b> <b>She</b> <b>said</b> at supper {{time that}} she had a toothache, and was going to retire early." [...] And thus speaking, the teacher hurried on.|$|E
6000|$|The boy's {{confidence}} in her hospitality touched Mrs. Bhaer, {{and she could}} not find the heart to disappoint his hope, and spoil his kind little plan, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Aunt Maria said <b>so.</b> <b>She</b> <b>said</b> I did not feel. Oh, if I {{could only}} die before he grows up to let one see it. Why wont {{you begin to}} hate me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am <b>so</b> sorry,' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{her voice}} all broken. 'I {{thought we were}} such good friends. I was so happy. And now you have spoilt it all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you <b>so</b> much,' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{and then}} <b>she</b> turned {{completely}} away again. She recovered her position, and lifting her face towards him, and addressing him exclusively, she said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I'm <b>so</b> sorry,' <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> 'I didn't mean to {{say such}} hateful things. I didn't mean to be unkind. I ought to have remembered how passionately you love her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Lady Harcourt {{felt herself}} {{by no means}} {{inclined}} {{to enter into the}} joke on either side; <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> with her gravest smile, [...] "I'm sure Mr. Stistick understands very well what he's talking about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did she?--I suppose <b>so.</b> <b>She</b> <b>said</b> I {{shall be}} glad to see you, cousin Dirck, {{whenever}} you can come, and I hope you will bring with you sometimes the clergyman of whom you have spoken." ...|$|E
60|$|Dorothy couldn't quite {{understand}} this, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> nothing {{more on the}} subject and presently had a new reason to marvel. For when they had quite finished their meal table and contents disappeared in a flash.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't think <b>so,</b> sir. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> {{her mind}} {{has been made}} up, ever since I {{brought her back to}} Gibraltar; so you see, the {{compliments}} did not go for much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I think I am right, <b>so</b> far,” <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> “This is {{the door}} to the secret rooms, but the key that unlocks it is somewhere in the floor. Turn back the rug, please, Inez.” ...|$|R
