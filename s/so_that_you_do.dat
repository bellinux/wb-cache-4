Hubert Célis of Halmaal {{was arrested}} for {{harbouring}} Jewish children, but was released after confronting his interrogator with the following words: [...] "You are a Catholic, and have forgotten that the Virgin was a Jewess, that Christ was Jewish, that He commanded us to love and help one another... That He told us: 'I have given you an example <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> as I have done'... You are a Catholic, {{and you do not}} understand what a priest is! You do not understand that a priest does not betray!".|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, NASA {{researchers}} Metzger, Muscatello, Mueller, and Mantovani {{argued for}} a bootstrapping approach to start self-replicating factories in space. They developed this concept {{on the basis of}} In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) technologies that NASA has been developing to [...] "live off the land" [...] on the Moon or Mars. Their modeling showed that in just 20 to 40 years this industry could become self-sufficient then grow to large size, enabling greater exploration in space as well as providing benefits back to Earth. In 2014, Thomas Kalil of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy published on the White House blog an interview with Metzger on bootstrapping solar system civilization through self-replicating space industry. Kalil requested the public submit ideas for how [...] "the Administration, the private sector, philanthropists, the research community, and storytellers can further these goals." [...] Kalil connected this concept to what former NASA Chief technologist Mason Peck has dubbed [...] "Massless Exploration", the ability to make everything in space <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not need to launch it from Earth. Peck has said, [...] "...all the mass we need to explore the solar system is already in space. It's just in the wrong shape." [...] In 2016, Metzger argued that fully self-replicating industry can be started over several decades by astronauts at a lunar outpost for a total cost (outpost plus starting the industry) of {{about a third of the}} space budgets of the International Space Station partner nations, and that this industry would solve Earth's energy and environmental problems in addition to providing massless exploration.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Mani of She'ab (in Galilee), Rabbi Joshua of Siknin (also in Galilee), and Rabbi Johanan {{all said}} {{in the name of}} Rabbi Levi that Nadab and Abihu died because of four things, in {{connection}} with each of which Scripture mentions death: (1) Because they had drunk wine, for in connection with drinking wine [...] mentions death, saying, [...] "Drink no wine nor strong drink [...] [...] [...] <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not die." [...] (2) Because they lacked the prescribed number of garments (while officiating), for in connection with appropriate garments [...] mentions death, saying, [...] "And they [...] shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons [...] [...] [...] so that they bear no iniquity and die." [...] Nadab and Abihu lacked their robes (implied perhaps by the report of [...] that they their bodies were carried out in their tunics), in connection with which [...] mentions death, saying, [...] "And it shall be upon Aaron to minister [...] [...] [...] so that he does not die." [...] (3) Because they entered the Sanctuary without washing their hands and feet, for [...] says, [...] "So they shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they do not die," [...] and [...] says, [...] "When they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, so that they do not die." [...] (4) Because they had no children, for in connection with not having children [...] mentions death, saying, [...] "And Nadab and Abihu died [...] [...] [...] and they had no children." [...] Abba Hanin taught that it was because they had no wives, for [...] says, [...] "And [...] make atonement for himself, and for his house," [...] and [...] "his house" [...] implies that he had to have a wife.|$|E

You can tell by the sound of the bullet if you hit the figure, and if you hit him you have done what you want to. You do not need to practise at distances over three hundred yards; that is quite the outside range at which you would ever want to do any shooting, indeed from fifty to two hundred I consider the useful distance to practise at. If you get to shoot so well that you can with certainty hit a man between those ranges, you may feel pretty comfortable in your mind that you can beat off any attack that might be made on a house you are defending.|$|E
60|$|The {{galleries}} are {{not only}} for the exhibition of pictures, but each has numbers of ateliers, where the artists work and teach. The libraries are the most wonderfully imagined things. You do not have to come and study in them, but if you are working up any particular subject, the books relating to it are sent to your dwelling every morning and brought away every noon, so that during the obligatory hours you have them completely at your disposition, and during the Voluntaries you can consult them {{with the rest of the}} public in the library; it is not thought best that study should be carried on throughout the day, and the results seem to justify this theory. If you want to read a book merely for pleasure, you are allowed to take it out and live with it as long as you like; the copy you have is immediately replaced with another, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not feel hurried and are not obliged to ramp through it in a week or a fortnight.|$|E

Action, as you and Stephen once taught me, and I think wisely, was to prove to our rulers by an agitation, orderly and intellectual, that we were sensible of our degradation; {{and that it was}} neither Christianlike nor prudent, neither good nor wise, to let us remain <b>so.</b> <b>That</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> and <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it well; the respect of the world, even of those who differed from you in interest or opinion, was not withheld from you; and can be withheld from none who exercise the moral power that springs from great talents and a good cause. You have let this great moral power, this pearl of price," [...] said Sybil with emotion,--"we cannot conceal it from ourselves, my father,--you have let it escape from your hands." ...|$|R
60|$|There are a {{good many}} trees on the hills and roundabout, and {{pleasant}} roads loitering along by the gentle river-side, {{and it has been}} so sunny and warm since we came here that we shall have quite a genial recollection of the place, if we leave it before the skies have time to frown. The day after we came, we climbed a high and pretty steep hill, through a path shadowed with trees and shrubbery, up to a tower, from the summit of which we had a wide view of mountain scenery and the greater part of Windermere. This lake is a lovely little pool among the hills, long and narrow, beautifully indented with tiny bays and headlands; and when we saw it, it was one smile (as broad a smile as its narrowness allowed) with really brilliant sunshine. All the scenery we have yet met with is in excellent taste, and keeps itself within very proper bounds,-- never getting too wild and rugged to shock the sensibilities of cultivated people, as American scenery is apt to do. On the rudest surface of English earth, there is seen the effect of centuries of civilization, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not quite get at naked Nature anywhere. And then every point of beauty is so well known, and has been described so much, that one must needs look through other people's eyes, and feels as if he were seeing a picture rather than a reality. Man has, in short, entire possession of Nature here, and I should think young men might sometimes yearn for a fresher draught. But an American likes it.|$|E

40|$|For an {{emerging}} mathematics teacher, planning is fundamental. A good lesson plan {{can provide a}} foundation for both effective teaching and successful learning.
