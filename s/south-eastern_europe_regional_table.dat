40|$|The article {{approaches}} religious {{phenomena in}} <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> in a historico-anthropological manner. With {{the aid of}} historical comparison, the author tries to throw light on the religious phenomena of <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> and to present them in a lucid review. A significant place in this process is given to historical sociology as a discipline which, among other, also deals with the religious conditioning of social processes. The text consists of two parts. In the first, the author deals {{with the question of}} the religious particularity of <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> and considers it from several viewpoints. The author regards the most important features of the religious situation in that part of Europe as being particularism, archaicism and syncretism. He analyses the historical conditioning of the viability of the three monotheistic world religions in the region, their influence on the social development of <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> the stance of the authorities towards religious communities and the existence of diverse traditions within individual religious cultures. Along with analysis of the presence of ancient elements and the continuity of pre-Christian rituals and beliefs, the author also stresses the strong syncretism marking the religious traditions of <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Europe.</b> In {{the second part of the}} text the author compares religious phenomena in <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> and analyses <b>regional</b> religious traditions. He presents from the historico-anthropological aspect the religious rituals, the bearers of rituals, the place and time of rituals and the ritual languages of each of the world religions represented in the region. Emphasising the continuity of religious life and religious traditions in <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> the author ends with the period of Communist rule in the second half of the 20 th century, and deliberation that Communism, too, with its atheist doctrine in the secular form of cult, in fact carried on from religious tradition...|$|R
50|$|Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, Kwaśniewski {{organized}} {{an international}} conference in Warsaw, with participation of leaders from Central, Eastern and <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> to strengthen <b>regional</b> activities in fighting international terrorism. Under Kwaśniewski's leadership, Poland became a strong ally of the United States {{in the war on}} terror, and contributed troops in the Iraq war, a move that was highly controversial in Poland and Europe. Poland was in charge of a sector of Iraq after the removal of Saddam Hussein. Polish membership of the European Union became a reality on 1 May 2004, during Kwaśniewski's second term. Both he and his wife Jolanta had campaigned for approval of the EU accession treaty in June 2003. He strongly supported including mention of Europe's Christian roots into the European Constitution.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/06/04/wkwas04.xmlhttp://www.prezydent.pl/x.node?id=3666 Thanks to his close relations with Leonid Kuchma, in late 2004 he became a mediator in a political conflict in Ukraine - the Orange Revolution, and according to some commentators, he played the major role in its peaceful solution.|$|R
