50|$|Giusto Manetti Battiloro {{is one of}} Florence's 25 oldest companies. Founded in Florence in 1820, {{the company}} {{produces}} and markets Gold leaf throughout the world. Since 1950 the company also has operations in hot <b>stamping</b> <b>foil.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the process}} known as hot foil <b>{{stamping}},</b> <b>foil</b> stamping machines uses heat to transfer metallic foil to a solid surface. Examples of items that are foil stamped include annual reports, pocket folders, product packaging, note cards/thank you cards, business cards, envelopes and letterhead. The foil stamp is a permanent process.|$|E
50|$|New {{adversity}} {{struck the}} company in 1966 with the infamous Flood of the Arno River in Florence, when {{the ground floor of}} the plant was completed flooded, submerging most of the machinery. Once again the company was able to overcome this difficulty, and from then on the Giusto Manetti Battiloro has gone through a period of intense development, coinciding with the acquisition of a new branch office in Florence (where the hot <b>stamping</b> <b>foil</b> activity was transferred), and with the opening of two affiliated companies in Spain, in the city of Almeria, and in Poland, in the city of Częstochowa. Once more in these years Manetti Gold leaf has been used in several prestigious operations in Italy and all over the world: the restoration of the spires of the skyscraper of the New York Life Building in New York, the great works of Tsarskoye Selo in Saint Petersburg, the reconstruction of the theatre La Fenice in Venice following the devastating fire of 29 January 1996, and the details of the Amerigo Vespucci (ship).|$|E

50|$|Cold foil {{evolved from}} hot <b>foil</b> <b>stamping.</b> Hot <b>foil</b> <b>stamping</b> is mostly used offline when foil is {{required}} on a preprinted substrate, {{such as in}} the manufacture of greeting cards and special occasion ribbons. Hot foil is economical but very slow. The types of graphics that can be applied are usually limited to text and bold images. Hot foil is not usable with heat-sensitive substrates such as polyethylene, vinyl, or shrink film.|$|R
40|$|The {{microporosity}} of lacquers of <b>stamped</b> aluminium <b>foils</b> can {{be detected}} by a rapid electrolytic test method using an electrolyte containing a wetting agent. Material properties and manufacturing parameters influence the level of microporosity. The influence of lacquer weight, double lacquering, <b>stamping</b> depth, aluminium <b>foil</b> thickness, and type of stamping has been investigated. The microporosity is enhanced by insufficient lacquer thickness, reduced foil thicknesses and higher stamping depths...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel concept of hot stamped conductors on wires in a nano- or microscale. The process of producing arrays of wires selectively on the desired contact pad by electroplating of a template foil is described. The new concept provides electrical conductivity by penetration of wire arrays through the conductive layer {{of a hot}} <b>stamping</b> <b>foil.</b> Because of the small {{cross section of the}} wires, a large surface provides a low resistance between the contact pad and the conductor. With this process the non-conductive layer of the hot <b>stamping</b> <b>foil</b> {{does not have to be}} removed. The wires are flexible and provide a good alternative for electrical connection of flexible electronics. Also the process temperature is low, which makes it possible to use materials which are sensitive to high temperatures. When renouncing the use of temperature sensitive materials, this method can be applicable for high temperature operation due to the lack of adhesive or solder...|$|E

40|$|The {{patterning}} of multilayered hot <b>stamping</b> <b>foil</b> by {{excimer laser}} has been examined {{in terms of}} irradiation parameters and layer structure. The foil consisted of (a) an upper layer of lacquer, (b) intermediate layers of polymer and Al and (c) a base layer {{of low melting point}} resin. Ablation of the foil was characterised by a sequential removal of the layers at a threshold level of fluence and number of pulses. For ablation by single pulse, the upper layer of lacquer (~ 1000 nm) was removed at 20 J/cm 2 and intermediate layers (~ 3500 nm) at 20 - 30 J/cm 2. Multiple pulses (= 5) at fluences of = 40 J/cm 2 resulted in ablation through the base resin layer. Ablation through the layers was accompanied by the formation of molten debris and resulted in the exposure of undamaged interfaces...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{printing}} process via hot embossing of either grating or micro-mirror microstructures {{has been demonstrated}} in thermoplastic acrylic lacquer. Embossing experiments were performed in the temperature range 100 - 150 °C and at 80 kN force. The range of microstructures has included a dot-matrix hologram, grating-based optically variable devices (OVDs) and a micro-mirror based OVD. High quality replicas of each type of device have been fabricated using this process. Embossed replicas of grating-based OVDs have shown optical effects including image switching and color movement. For devices based on micro-mirror arrays, the embossed replicas have shown an optically variable switch between a portrait and a non-portrait image. Printing via an embossing process offers the possibility of incorporating optically variable devices into documents {{without the use of}} hot <b>stamping</b> <b>foil.</b> This is particularly relevant for documents based on polymeric substrates such as credit cards and polymer banknotes...|$|E
50|$|World War II {{led to a}} {{reduction}} of the company’s activities caused by the call to arms {{of most of the}} male employees. On 2 July 1944 Florence was bombed by American aircraft, and the company's buildings were completely destroyed (the Americans likely mistook the factory for a railway freight depot). Despite this blow to the company, soon {{after the end of the}} war, in 1946, the Giusto Manetti Battiloro resumed gold leaf manufacturing, inaugurating the partial reconstruction of the plant.In 1950 the company made their first agreement with an English goldbeater for the marketing and selling of hot <b>stamping</b> <b>foils,</b> thus originating the second branch of the company, which has since worked in tandem with the historical manufacturing of gold leaf.|$|R

50|$|A {{hologram}} may be embedded either via hot-stamping foil, wherein {{an extremely}} {{thin layer of}} only a few micrometers of depth is bonded into the paper or a plastic substrate by means of a hot-melt adhesive (called a size coat) and heat from a metal die, or it may be directly embossed as holographic paper, or onto the laminate of a card itself.When incorporated with a custom design pattern or logo, hologram hot <b>stamping</b> <b>foils</b> become security foils that protect credit cards, passports, bank notes and value documents from counterfeiting. Holograms help in curtailing forging, and duplication of products hence are very essential for security purposes. Once stamped on a product, they cannot be removed or forged, enhancing the product at the same time. Also from a security perspective, if stamped, a hologram is a superior security device as {{it is virtually impossible to}} remove from its substrate.|$|R

50|$|Combination {{embossing}} is {{the process}} of embossing and <b>foil</b> <b>stamping</b> the same image. It involves imprinting and aligning foil over an embossed image to create a foil emboss. A sculptured die, generally made of brass is used for this procedure. The process requires close registration that must be controlled to keep the image and foil matched precisely. The process of embossing and <b>foil</b> <b>stamping</b> is accomplished in one operation {{with the use of a}} combination die. The combination die has a cutting edge around the perimeter to cleanly break the excess foil away from the embossed area.|$|R

40|$|Packaging plays {{a crucial}} role in {{communicating}} product benefits to consumers. Oftentimes, designers use high visibility enhancements to differentiate packaging within the competitive array. Although luxury brands commonly use enhanced graphical and printing techniques to convey high quality products, many private label package designers are also utilizing enhancements to attract attention to their products. This research sought to understand how incorporating <b>foil</b> <b>stamping</b> to the primary panel of fast moving consumer good packaging will affect consumer attention and purchase preference. Through the collection of quantitative data, consumer attention and purchase preference were evaluated. Three different products were selected for evaluation for the study: popcorn, cereal, and boxed pasta dinners. A total of 172 participants completed the study, which took place in a realistic and immersive shopping environment (CUshop™). Two eye tracking metrics were collected using mobile eye tracking technology. Participants completed a qualitative survey, which recorded basic demographic information. Significance tests were conducted to test for statistical differences in consumer attention behavior as well as purchase decision between the foil and control packages. It was determined that <b>foil</b> <b>stamping</b> did significantly (α = 0. 05) affect consumer attention towards the respective product compared to the control, yet the effect was not consistent. Eye tracking metrics varied across the products and categories tested; some <b>foil</b> <b>stamped</b> samples positively affected consumer attention, others negatively and some had no effect whatsoever. Results show that <b>foil</b> <b>stamping</b> can be a highly strategic influencer (both positively and negatively) on consumer attention and purchase decision. However, it is recommended that this enhancement be tested within an in-context environment to ensure it benefits the brand and product within the competitive array...|$|R

2500|$|While many {{contemporary}} designs portray ritual dances, {{at least three}} examples show scenes exceptionally similar to that on the Sutton Hoo helmet {{and contribute to the}} understanding of the depicted sword dance. The same design—identical but for a different type of spears held in hand, a different pattern of dress, and a lack of crossed spears behind the two men—is found on the Valsgärde 7 helmet, while a small fragment of <b>stamped</b> <b>foil</b> from the eastern mound at Gamla Uppsala is [...] "so close in every respect to the corresponding warrior on the Sutton Hoo helmet as to appear at first glance to be from the same die," [...] and may even have been [...] "cut by the same man." [...] The third similar design is one of the four Torslunda plates (...) , discovered in Öland, Sweden, in 1870. This plate, which is complete and depicts a figure with the same attributes as on design 1, suggests the association of the men in the Sutton Hoo example with [...] "the cult of Odin." [...] The Torslunda figure is missing an eye, which laser scanning revealed to have been removed by a [...] "sharp cut, probably in the original model used for the mould." [...] Odin too lost an eye, thus evidencing the identification of the Torslunda figure as him, and the Sutton Hoo figures as devotees of him.|$|R
