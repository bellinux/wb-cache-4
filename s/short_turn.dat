5|$|The Old Colony's {{access to}} South Framingham was the Mansfield & Framingham, {{which opened in}} 1870 and was also {{acquired}} in 1879. By {{the time of the}} Old Colony takeover, South Framingham featured the 1848-built station, a freight house, a car house, and three separate engine houses serving the various branch lines. Through service on the mainline operated as far as Albany; the B had joined with the Western Railroad in 1867 to become the Boston and Albany Railroad. Framingham began to be used occasionally as a <b>short</b> <b>turn</b> terminus for Boston-bound commuter trains in the early 1860s and continuously as such after 1864. , a small number of Framingham/Worcester Line trains are short-turned at Framingham.|$|E

40|$|The use of air-gap {{magnetic}} flux probes has proven {{effective in the}} detection of generator rotor winding <b>shorted</b> <b>turns</b> and has helped {{to improve the quality}} of predictive maintenance decisions concerning when or if to perform rotor rework. Analysis of air-gap flux probe data can pinpoint the number and location (pole and coil) of <b>shorted</b> <b>turns</b> without having to take the generator offline. This paper will discuss the theory, methodology and benefits of detecting <b>shorted</b> <b>turns</b> in generator rotors. A number of case studies will be presented. EFFECTS OF SHORTED TURNS IN ROTOR WINDINGS The impact of operating a round rotor generator with rotor winding <b>shorted</b> <b>turns</b> depends upon many factors 1. If the percentage of total <b>turns</b> <b>shorted</b> out is small, the generator may be able to run at rated load for years without further problems. However, larger <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> percentages can cause operating conditions that may limit unit loads. If the problems become severe, forced outages may occur. Conditions that may result in running a rotor with shorted-turns include: 1. Rotor unbalance that varies with field current changes (thermal sensitivity). Coils with shorted-turns operate at lower temperatures than coils without shorted-turns. This i...|$|R
25|$|The heavy-rail subway {{lines were}} built in {{multiple}} segments with multiple crossovers.

Planned service suspensions generally occur on weekends for planned maintenance activities that are impractical to perform overnight. There is only one regular <b>short</b> <b>turn</b> service which occurs during the morning rush hour on Line 1 Yonge–University when some northbound trains short-turn at St. Clair West station or, in rarer cases, Glencairn station.|$|E

Select weekday runs of the Q111 continue past Rosedale into Nassau County, turning south and west via Peninsula Boulevard and ending at Rockaway Turnpike in Cedarhurst. The Q111 route along 147th Avenue and in Nassau County mirrors the original planned routing of the trolley line, which was never constructed.|$|E

When the station opened, all four Sixth Avenue tracks ran continuously from West Fourth Street through Second Avenue. During {{the construction of the}} Chrystie Street Connection in the 1950s and 1960s, the center express tracks at Broadway–Lafayette Street were severed from the tracks at Second Avenue and rerouted to the Chrystie Street subway, running through Grand Street station to {{the north side of the}} Manhattan Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center (originally Atlantic Avenue) is {{an express}} {{station on the}} IRT Eastern Parkway Line which has four tracks, one island platform, and two side platforms. On the center platform, there are two old {{indicator}} signs which mark the next train, formerly used for non-rush hour <b>short</b> <b>turn</b> trains. An old style sign to the Brooklyn Academy of Music also exists. The trackway to the Long Island Rail Road Atlantic Branch is still visible {{at the north end}} of the northbound local track, although much of it is behind corrugated wall; more information about this and other unused trackways is at Bergen Street. The LIRR Atlantic Terminal platforms, slightly lower, are clearly visible through floor-to-ceiling railings.|$|E
25|$|Modifications {{were made}} to a stub end tunnel (also known as the Penn Pocket, which was {{originally}} built for <b>short</b> <b>turn</b> World Trade Center to Exchange Place runs to handle PRR commuters from Harborside Terminal) to allow trains from Newark to reach the Hoboken bound tunnel and vice versa. The modifications required PATH to bore through the bedrock dividing the stub tunnel and the tunnels to and from Newark. The new Exchange Place station opened in June 2003. Because of the original alignment of the tracks, trains to/from Hoboken use separate tunnels from the Newark service. From Newark, trains cross over to the Newark/Hoboken bound track just north of Exchange Place. The train then reversed direction and used a crossover switch to go to Hoboken. From Hoboken, trains enter on the Manhattan-bound track at Exchange Place. The train then reversed direction and used the same crossover switch {{to go to the}} Newark-bound tracks before entering Grove Street.|$|E

40|$|Online {{condition}} monitoring is preferred specifically in critical induction machines for timely {{analysis of their}} health and to predict any incipient failures. Negative sequence current monitoring {{is one of the}} well-known {{condition monitoring}} applications that capable of identifying stator faults in induction motor as well as producing fast and reliable results using a simple measurement technique. However, the technique is sensitive to asymmetrical sources of negative sequence, not only due to motor faults but also due to the disturbances such as sensor calibration, inherent non-idealities (such as inherent machine asymmetries), external effects (such as load change and supply voltage unbalances). This thesis addresses the limitations in <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> fault detection while considering real system disturbances and non-linearities using a dynamic motor model which is also verified by the experimental studies. The thesis provides a comprehensive investigation of various negative sequence contributors such as measurement asymmetry, inherent asymmetry, voltage unbalance, <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> faults, eccentricity and broken rotor bar faults under load variations, and presents practical results. To allow accurate <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> fault detection, this thesis also provides an effective phasor compensation technique for these disturbances. A new detailed compensation by demonstrating step-by-step disturbance extraction to obtain the real negative sequence current due to <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> faults are also presented.
