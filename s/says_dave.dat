The man lies who ever <b>says</b> <b>Dave</b> told a lie, and that man will have to fight with me, too, as well—if there’s {{anything}} left of him when Dave gets done with him. For Dave is a fighter. Oh, yes, he’s a scrapper from way back. He got a grizzly with a ’38 popgun. He got clawed some, but {{he knew what he was}} doin’. He went into the cave on purpose to get that grizzly. ’Fraid of nothing. Free an’ easy with his money, or his last shirt an’ match when out of money. Why, he drained Surprise Lake here in three weeks an’ took out ninety thousand, didn’t he?” She flushed and nodded her head proudly. Through his recital she had followed every word with keenest interest. “An’ I must say,” Lon went on, “that I was disappointed sore on not meeting Dave here to-night.” ...|$|E

He <b>says</b> <b>Dave</b> and Aubrey hit a speed bump because it was their first time, but Dave should be a man and give it another try.|$|E

50|$|A {{few days}} later, when Jean and Dave went into town, Heather disappears. Molly realizes where she went: {{to the house}} where Helen and her family died. Molly heads to the house, which is {{currently}} abandoned. It begins to sprinkle, and eventually starts pouring. Molly overhears her stepsister talking to the ghost. Heather and Helen are inside the house. Molly ducks under one of windows. She quietly watches them. The ghost is becoming impatient with Heather. Heather doesn't want to drown herself because she's scared and doesn't want to leave her father. Helen <b>says</b> <b>Dave</b> stopped loving Heather when he married Jean. The ghost goes on to explain how much happier Heather will be after she drowns herself and they can finally be together forever. Heather finally agrees to do what Helen wants. They head to the pond. Both of them jump in. Molly jumps in after them. Helen realizes Molly's trying to save Heather. The ghost attacks Molly as she pulls Heather's head above water. Molly stops the attack by pulling the locket off Heather's neck and throwing it {{as hard as she}} can. The ghost chooses to save her locket over attempting to drown Heather. Molly drags an unconscious Heather to the shore and performs mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on her. Heather wakes up. She sees Molly and frantically tries to jump back into the pond. Instead, Molly drags her into the house. It's raining so hard by now they have to wait for it to stop before going home.|$|E

40|$|For {{a theory}} as {{genuinely}} elegant as the Standard Model [...] the current framework describing elementary particles and their forces [...] it can sometimes appear to {{students to be}} little more than a complicated collection of particles and ranked list of interactions. The Standard Model in a Nutshell provides a comprehensive and uncommonly accessible introduction {{to one of the most}} important subjects in modern physics, revealing why, despite initial appearances, the entire framework really is as elegant as physicists <b>say.</b> <b>Dave</b> Goldberg uses a "just-in-time" approach to instruction that enables students to gradually develop a deep understanding of the Standard Model even if this is their first exposure to it. He covers everything from relativity, group theory, and relativistic quantum mechanics to the Higgs boson, unification schemes, and physics beyond the Standard Model. The book also looks at new avenues of research that could answer still-unresolved questions and features numerous worked examples, helpful illustrations, and more than 120 exercises...|$|R
