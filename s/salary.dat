5|$|As at 31 December 2010, the {{remuneration}} of ministers depended on which ministerial grade – from the lowest to the highest, MR4, MR3, MR2 or MR1 – they were at. Each minister's pay package {{was made up}} of fixed components (a monthly <b>salary</b> for 12 months, a non-pensionable annual allowance of one month's <b>salary,</b> a special allowance of one month's <b>salary,</b> and a public service leadership allowance of two months' <b>salary)</b> and variable components (an annual variable component, a performance bonus, and a gross domestic product (GDP) bonus). The annual variable component of up to one and a half month's <b>salary</b> was paid based on Singapore's economic performance. In years where economic performance was exceptional, a special variable payment was also made. Each minister's performance bonus was determined by the Prime Minister and could be up to 14 months' <b>salary,</b> though most good performers received the equivalent of nine months' <b>salary.</b> The GDP bonus depended on the nation's GDP growth rate. No bonus was paid if the rate was below 2%, and a maximum bonus of eight months' <b>salary</b> was paid if the rate was 10% or greater. In addition, ministers received the same medical benefits as civil servants. In 2010, the benchmark annual remuneration for an MR4-grade minister was $2,598,004, while the actual <b>salary</b> paid was $1,583,900. An MR1-grade minister's <b>salary</b> was $2,368,500. The annual pay of the Prime Minister was set at a fixed ratio to the MR4 <b>salary,</b> and was $3,072,200 in 2010. This included a fixed service bonus in lieu of a performance bonus since {{there was no one to}} assess the Prime Minister's individual performance. The fixed service bonus was the same as the performance bonus paid to a good performer at the MR4 grade.|$|E

5|$|During his career, Russell {{was one of}} {{the first}} big earners in NBA basketball. His 1956 rookie {{contract}} was worth $24,000, only fractionally smaller than the $25,000 of top earner Bob Cousy. In contrast to other Celtics, who had to work in the offseason to maintain their standard of living (Heinsohn sold insurance, Gene Guarilia was a professional guitar player, Cousy ran a basketball camp, and Auerbach invested in plastics and a Chinese restaurant), Russell never had to work part-time. When Wilt Chamberlain became the first NBA player to earn $100,000 in <b>salary</b> in 1965, Russell went to Auerbach and demanded a $100,001 <b>salary,</b> which he promptly received. For his promotion to coach the Celtics paid Russell an annual <b>salary</b> of $25,000 which was in addition to his <b>salary</b> as a player; although the <b>salary</b> was touted in the press as a record for an NBA coach, it is unclear whether Russell's continued $100,001 <b>salary</b> as a player was included in the calculation.|$|E

Including the effects of union activity in neighboring districts, the study also finds that union activity increases <b>salaries</b> for experienced teachers by as much as 18 - 28 percent but increases <b>salaries</b> for beginning teachers by a considerably smaller amount. ...|$|R

40|$|The author uses {{a spatial}} econometric {{framework}} {{to examine the}} determinants of teacher <b>salaries</b> in the United States, including union activity in the teachers’ own and in neighboring districts, teacher <b>salaries</b> in nearby districts, and other school district characteristics such as size and student-teacher ratios. Using the 1999 – 2000 Schools and Staffing Survey {{as well as the}} School District Demographic System and Bureau of Labor Statistics data sets, he finds that union activity increases <b>salaries</b> for experienced teachers by as much as 18 to 28 %; it increases <b>salaries</b> for beginning teachers, however, by considerably less. Results also confirm that <b>salaries</b> for experienced and beginning teachers are positively affected by the <b>salaries</b> of teachers in nearby districts. A one-percent increase in the distance-weighted average of teacher <b>salaries</b> in nearby districts increases <b>salaries</b> in a given district by 0. 52 % for experienced teachers and 0. 66 % for beginning teachers. Studies that ignore such spatial dependence are likely to be mis-specified and may lead to misleading conclusions...|$|R
