5000|$|The assist light (also {{known as}} AF illuminator) [...] "activates" [...] passive {{autofocus}} systems in low-light and low-contrast situations in some cameras. The lamp projects visible or IR light onto the subject, which the camera's autofocus system uses to achieve focus. Many cameras {{that do not}} have a dedicated autofocus assist lamp instead use their built-in flash, illuminating the subject with stroboscopic bursts of light. The strobe bursts aid the autofocus system in the same fashion as a dedicated assist light, but have the disadvantage of startling or annoying living subjects. Another disadvantage is that if the camera uses flash focus assist and is set to an operation mode that overrides the flash, it may also disable the focus assist and autofocus may fail to acquire the subject. Similar <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flashing</b> is sometime used to reduce the red-eye effect, but this method is only intended to constrict the subject's eye pupils prior to the actual shot being taken, and thus reduce retinal reflections.|$|R

40|$|A {{new system}} has been {{designed}} to deliver a comprehensive analysis of the visual sensory system and oculomotor responses to different types of visual and vestibular stimulation. The instrument, called a Computerized Electro-Oculograph (CEOG), is an integrated computer-controlled system which performs a series of important diagnostic tests. It can generate and control the stimulus, as well as record patient responses, testing both the visual and oculomotor systems, and also provide a regular pattern applicable to both clinical and research purposes. Visual evoked response and eye movement data is processed by computer for quantitative analysis and “strip chart” data is then displayed on a scrolling T. V. screen. Hard copy of the output is also available. The system can analyze visual evoked responses to both <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flashing</b> lights and intermittent patterned stimulation. Other programs study the main features of the wave form and details of speed, frequency, and latency, as well as the symmetry of spontaneous, visual, and vestibular evoked eye movements. A major advantage of the system is its rapid, automatic, and quantitative operation with no risk to the current status of the visual and oculomotor pathways as it performs EOG (electro-oculograph), VER (visual evoked response), ERG (electronetinograph), and caloric tests.

I looked back toward the birdbath and noticed a small black bird drinking. I knew it wasn 2 ̆ 7 t anything I had ever seen before, so I eased back into the garage to get a closer look out the window (it 2 ̆ 7 s much closer to the birdbath, and birds are much less alarmed being watched through glass). I watched it as long as it drank. The white flashed were significant, I knew, though no white showed when the bird was at rest. The slender, black body (thank God for so few field markings!), the tail shape and length, and the cedar waxwing-like crest all seemed adequate for me to identify the bird. It flew away and I flew into the house to try to find the bird in my field guides. The only detail I had to confirm during other sightings was the red eyes, and he had them. The Phainopepla came back four or five times that day to drink. Knowing it might not survive the cold or native birds, I took the photos the first day it came around.

5000|$|Helicopters also vibrate; an {{unadjusted}} helicopter {{can easily}} vibrate {{so much that}} it will shake itself apart. To reduce vibration, all helicopters have rotor adjustments for height and weight. Blade height is adjusted by changing the pitch of the blade. Weight is adjusted by adding or removing weights on the rotor head and/or at the blade end caps. Most also have vibration dampers for height and pitch. Some also use mechanical feedback systems to sense and counter vibration. Usually the feedback system uses a mass as a [...] "stable reference" [...] and a linkage from the mass operates a flap to adjust the rotor's angle of attack to counter the vibration. Adjustment is difficult in part because measurement of the vibration is hard, usually requiring sophisticated accelerometers mounted throughout the airframe and gearboxes. The most common blade vibration adjustment measurement system is to use a <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flash</b> lamp, and observe painted markings or coloured reflectors {{on the underside of the}} rotor blades. The traditional low-tech system is to mount coloured chalk on the rotor tips, and see how they mark a linen sheet. Gearbox vibration most often requires a gearbox overhaul or replacement. Gearbox or drive train vibrations can be extremely harmful to a pilot. The most severe being pain, numbness, loss of tactile discrimination and dexterity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effect is}} most {{commonly}} demonstrated with a device known as Benham's top. It {{can also be}} seen in <b>stroboscopic</b> lights when <b>flashes</b> are set at certain critical speeds. Rotating fan blades, particularly aluminum ones, can also demonstrate the effect; as the fan accelerates or decelerates, the colors appear, drift, change and disappear. The stable running speed of the fan does not (normally) produce colors, suggesting that it is not an interference effect with the frequency of the illumination flicker.The effect was noted by Gustav Fechner and Hermann von Helmholtz and propagated to English-speakers through Charles Benham's invention of his top. The perceptual mechanism of Fechner color is not entirely understood. Florence Winger Bagley was one of the early investigators of this phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to study the changes in {{rotation}} rate of the bacterial motor {{and to try to}} discriminate between various sources of these changes with the aim of understanding the mechanism of force generation better. To this end Escherichia coli cells were tethered and videotaped with brief <b>stroboscopic</b> light <b>flashes.</b> The records were scanned by means of a computerized motion analysis system, yielding cell size, radius of rotation, and accumulated angle of rotation as functions of time for each cell selected. In conformity with previous studies, fluctuations in the rotation rate of the flagellar motor were invariably found. Employing an exclusively counterclockwise rotating mutant ("gutted" RP 1091 strain) and using power spectral density, autocorrelation and residual mean square angle analysis, we found that a simple superposition of rotational diffusion on a steady rotary motion is insufficient to describe the observed rotation. We observed two additional rotational components, one fluctuating (0. 04 - 0. 6 s) and one oscillating (0. 8 - 7 s). However, the effective rotational diffusion coefficient obtained after taking these two components into account generally exceeded that calculated from external friction by two orders of magnitude. This is consistent with a model incorporating association and dissociation of force-generating units...|$|R

The method is illustrated by analysis of a slow, powered turn of the bat Plecotus auritus (L.). Accurate reconstruction of the flight path permits mechanical forces and accelerations acting on the bat during the turn to be estimated: turning speed and radius in a narrow space are restricted by the bat's ability to generate sufficient lift to support the weight in nonlinear level flight...|$|R

Heuser (born August 29, 1942) is an American Professor of Biophysics in the {{department}} of Cell Biology and Physiology at the Washington University School of Medicine as well as a Professor at the Institute for Integrated Cell-Matieral Sciences (iCeMS) at Kyoto University. Heuser created quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy, a pioneering technique that lets biologists take detailed pictures of fleeting events inside living cells. For decades, Heuser has used this technique to capture details of the molecular mechanisms that underlie many basic biological activities, including nerve cell signal transmission, muscle contraction, and most recently, the fusion of viruses with cells during the spread of infection. He compares quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy to using a <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flash</b> to freeze the action in a photograph. To make it possible to image the frozen sample with an electron microscope, Heuser adds an ultra-thin film of metallic platinum that molds snugly against the sample's frozen surface contours. He and others in his lab have worked to make the equipment and procedures necessary for this process available to researchers around the world. Currently Heuser has patents pending on Washington University's behalf for even more advanced versions of his quick-freezing machines. Heuser graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1969 and joined the Washington University faculty as a professor of biophysics in 1980. He is currently associate editor of the Journal of Neurocytology and previously served as associate editor of the Journal of Cell Biology. His curriculum vitae lists over 200 scientific publications.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} that binocular flash-induced nystagmus (B-FIN) can be evoked in humans. Design: The study evaluated the presence of B-FIN by stimulation with a <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flash.</b> Setting: The study was conducted with 12 healthy patients in the Otorhinolaryngology Department of the University of Genoa (Italy), between April 2008 and January 2009. Methods: Patients underwent binocular flashing light stimulation, in the dark, by <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flash</b> presented through a photostimulator at frequencies of 4. 7 and 7. 69 cycles/second for 120 seconds, with their eyes covered by a homogeneous field hollow opal hemisphere. The photostimulator was placed in three different positions with respect to the anterior-posterior axis: 0 u, 45 u to the right, and 45 u to the left. Main Outcome Measures: Eyemovementswere recorded by electronystagmography (ENG). ENGrecording started 30 seconds before the stimulation and stopped 60 seconds after the end of the luminance stimuli to test the presence of flash induced after nystagmus (FIAN). Results: B-FIN was clearly evoked from 10 of the 12 healthy adults, whereas FIAN was evoked from 4 of the 12 subjects. The best stimulation of B-FIN was obtained through an intermittent luminance stimulus presented at a frequency of 4. 7 cycles/second and the photostimulator placed at 0 u to the optic axis. Conclusions: Our investigation demonstrates that B-FIN can be evoked in humans and its possible value in the differential diagnosis between central and peripheral vertigo...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{filtering}} of images of objects in a CAD system, that simultaneously move in very fast and slow motion, so that their dynamics {{can be observed in}} truthfully time scaled VR. Micro-Electro-Mechanical systems (MEMS) are miniaturized mechanical or optical equipment less than a millimetre in size. While some have movable parts, such as membranes, valves, cantilevers, others may have only fixed parts. Those with movable parts, can flick, pump or pulsate at rates of up to 500 Hz, while other components in the same MEMS move at slower speeds. This poses a series of problems for truthfully time scaled visualizations. Due to the human being’s vision limitation, and the computer’s frame rate (which is normally 30 times per second), very fast movements can not be observed clearly, e. g. when a gear rotating in clockwise direction is in high frequency, it appears rotating counter-clockwise. In MEMS a simple truthful time scaling may result in one of the objects still at non-observable fast motion, while another practically reaches a standstill. To solve the dilemma we simulate to illuminate the moving objects with a simulated stroboscopic light. The stroboscopic simulation is demonstrated with an example of rotating gears created in a virtual interactive VRML environment. In this paper we present the results of a systematic combinatorial analysis for finding the stroboscopic illumination intervals and <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flash</b> duration that produce useful dynamic images...|$|E
40|$|Overall, {{the results}} {{obtained}} in both the U. S. and the Russian space programs indicate that most space crews will experience some symptoms of motion sickness (MS) causing {{significant impact on the}} operational objectives that must be accomplished to assure mission success. At this time the primary countermeasure for MS requires the administration of Promethazine. Promethazine is not a benign drug, and is most frequently administered just prior to the sleep cycle to prevent its side effects from further compromising mission objectives. Clearly other countermeasures for SMS must be developed. Currently the primary focus is on two different technologies: (1) developing new and different pharmacological compounds with less significant side effects, (2) preflight training. The primary problem with all of these methods for controlling MS is time. New drugs that may be beneficial are years from testing and development, and preflight training requires a significant investment of crew time during an already intensive pre-launch schedule. Granted, motion sickness symptoms can be minimized with either of the two methods detailed above, however, {{it may be possible to}} develop a countermeasure that does not require either extensive adaptation time or exposure to motion sickness. Approximately 25 years ago Professor Geoffrey Melvill Jones presented his work on adaptation of the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) using optically reversed vision (left-right prisms) during head rotations in the horizontal plane. It was of no surprise that most subjects experienced motion sickness while wearing the optically reversing prisms. However, a serendipitous finding emerged during this research showing that the same subjects did not experience motion sickness symptoms when wearing the reversing prisms under stroboscopic illumination. The mechanism, by which this side-effect was believed to have occurred, is not clearly understood. However, the fact that no motion sickness was ever noted, suggests the possibility of producing functionally useful adaptation during space flight without the penalty of disabling motion sickness by controlling the rate of the adaptive process by means of an appropriate stroboscopically presented environment. After several recent meetings with Professor Melvill Jones, we were encouraged to repeat the motion sickness portions of his and Mandl's 1981 stroboscopic experiment. In conducting this experiment we used a randomized cross-over design where subjects were randomly assigned to either a <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>flash</b> or no strobe for their first exposure in the experimental design. Twenty subjects (19 subjects completed the study) read a short passage from Treasure Island mounted on the wall approximately 1 m from their eyes while wearing left-right reversing prisms. The strobe on time of 3 microseconds and flash frequency of 4 Hz was set to equal that used in the original study. Motion sickness was scored using a modified Miller and Graybiel scale that we constructed to include symptoms that may be elicited under conditions where reversing prisms are worn. On this scale a score of 5 represented Malaise IIa (mild motion sickness) and a score of 8 or above is approaching frank sickness. Symptoms were tracked and recorded every 5 min during the task. Testing was limited to 30 min unless the subject had reached the MIIa score, at which time the test was terminated. Performance under stroboscopic illumination was significantly better than when the subjects read under normal room illumination while wearing the left-right reversing prisms. Based on these results we developed a goggle system using LCD material that can be strobed. To evaluate the effectiveness of stroboscopic goggles we tested an additional 9 subjects in addition to retesting 10 used in the stroboscopic pilot study described above. These 19 subjects wore a pair of strobing LCD goggles that could be cycled at 4 Hz. These subjects wore the goggles while also wearing left-right reversg prisms. Results while wearing the goggles showed that none of the 19 subjects scored at the MIIa level on the motion sickness rating scale. When the goggles did not flash (no strobe), 11 of the 19 developed symptoms above the MIIa criteria. As a countermeasure the goggles seem to be effective, even with an on time of 10 msec (time the goggles are clear). We have also collected anecdotal data, from our personnel in the Neuroscience Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center, suggesting that the goggles may effective in preventing carsickness...|$|E
