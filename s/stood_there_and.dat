25|$|One {{death was}} reported. Protestor Baharuddin Ahmad accidentally inhaled tear gas fired by police. He was later arrested, {{but when he}} started to black out police didn't do {{anything}} and just <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> watched. He was restrained by handcuffs which made the matters worse and he wasn't released because police lost the keys. After 15 minutes, an ambulance was called but never arrived. Finally, a volunteer took Baharuddin to a nearby hospital but it was already too late. Police said he died of heart complications.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{house was}} built in 1759 for Loyalist John Vassall who inherited the land along {{what was called the}} King's Highway in Cambridge when he was 21. He demolished the structure that had <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> built a new mansion. The home became his summer residence with his wife Elizabeth (Oliver) and children until 1774. His wife's brother was Thomas Oliver, then royal lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, who in 1766 moved to Cambridge and built the nearby mansion now known as Elmwood.

500|$|In the hatch, Sayid (Naveen Andrews) and Ana-Lucía (Michelle Rodriguez) {{interrogate}} [...] "Henry Gale" [...] (Michael Emerson). After Henry's new cover-up {{story is}} proved false, Henry finally {{admits that he}} is indeed an Other, but says he would be killed if he talks. Later, Locke (Terry O'Quinn) confronts the prisoner, demanding {{to know if he}} let himself be caught, thinking it might have been to find the Swan. [...] "Henry", however, calls the hatch a [...] "joke", saying that during the lockdown, he never entered the numbers into the computer or pushed the button; he simply <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> watched the timer's numbers turn to red hieroglyphs before they reset back on their own. Locke, however, replies angrily that Henry is lying, but he replies that he's [...] "done lying".|$|E

500|$|... "John Doe" [...] was co-executive MacLaren's directorial debut. Although she {{had never}} helmed an episode before, MacLaren {{utilized}} information that she had gathered by working with Kim Manners, one of the series' prolific directors. She later noted, [...] "Kim taught me how he breaks down a script and prepares his shot list. The most powerful thing {{he said to me}} was that he imagines the show all cut together and sees the movie in his head and really visualizes it." [...] Gilligan later said that MacLaren [...] "really rose to the occasion and really did her homework." [...] The bus crash scene was created with the use of elaborate [...] "smoke and mirrors", according to Gilligan. Over nine cameras were used to film the entire scene. Several of the cameras were under-cranked in order to give the illusion that the bus was going faster than it really was. A steel ramp was buried in the ground to flip the bus. However, the scene was reportedly torpid to film. Gilligan later joked that [...] "You could have <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> had a sandwich while the thing was backing up: it was so slow." ...|$|E
500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> went, [...] "This is so cool. This is like a general rallying the troops.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Maidana was {{guaranteed}} a purse of $1.5 million, which would also include TV revenue {{from his native}} Argentina and PPV share. Mayweather earned a minimum $32 million. There were calls for an immediate rematch. Mayweather said, [...] "He put pressure on me and that's when I decided to fight differently," [...] Mayweather said. [...] "I <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> fought him. He's a good fighter, I take nothing away from him [...] This was a tough, competitive fight. This is what fans want to see. [...] "I want to give fans an exciting fight. Normally, I box and move. Tonight, I gave fans an exciting fight." [...] Maidana felt he won the fight, believing he gave Mayweather his toughest fight ever. Speaking through a translator, he said, [...] "I definitely think I won. Floyd had never {{been hit by a}} man before. I had to change the gloves [...] and I still gave him a great fight. He did dominate some rounds but the majority, I dominated them." ...|$|E
