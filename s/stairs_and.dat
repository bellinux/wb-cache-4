5|$|At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda {{left the}} bunker {{and walked up}} to the garden of the Chancellery, where they {{committed}} suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot Magda and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining <b>stairs</b> <b>and,</b> once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into his body, which did not move.|$|E

5|$|The {{standards}} and balusters {{of the stairs}} {{on the north side}} of the hall came from Eversley Manor House and probably date to the mid-17th century, although the treads are original to the house and possibly mid-16th century.

There are seven full-time entrances at four locations (consisting of six <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> one elevator), which are indicated in green, and nine other part-time entrances, which are indicated in red.|$|E
5|$|A {{transfer}} will {{be constructed}} {{at the eastern}} end of the 125th Street station to connect to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's 125th Street station. A new lower-level mezzanine will house the connection between the two stations, directly connecting to the downtown platform for Lexington Avenue service. The direct connection to the staircases to the upper level will be rebuilt. At the western end of the station, a transfer will be built to connect to the Harlem–125th Street station of the Metro-North Railroad. An elevator, <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> escalators would connect the two stations.|$|E
5|$|Bin Laden {{peered through}} his bedroom {{door at the}} Americans {{advancing}} up the <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> then retreated into the room as the lead SEAL fired a shot at him, which either missed or {{hit him in the}} side. Robert O’Neill, who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot bin Laden, rolled through the door and confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E

5|$|Borobudur was {{considered}} {{as the source}} of souvenirs, and parts of its sculptures were looted, some even with colonial-government consent. In 1896 King Chulalongkorn of Siam visited Java and requested and was allowed to take home eight cartloads of sculptures taken from Borobudur. These include thirty pieces taken from a number of relief panels, five buddha images, two lions, one gargoyle, several kala motifs from the <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> gateways, and a guardian statue (dvarapala). Several of these artifacts, most notably the lions, dvarapala, kala, makara and giant waterspouts are now on display in the Java Art room in The National Museum in Bangkok.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} range, {{parts of the}} medieval {{buildings}} survive and are incorporated into staircase ten — the straight, steep flight of <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> timber framed partitions date from a mid-15th century rebuilding of St Mary Hall. The former Chapel, Hall and Buttery of St Mary Hall, built in 1640, form part of the Junior Library and Junior Common Room. Viewed from the third quad, the Chapel, with its Gothic windows, {{can be seen to}} have been built neatly on top of the Hall, a unique example in Oxford of such a plan.|$|E
5|$|The Dalek {{ability to}} fly or hover {{dates back to}} The Chase, where a Dalek was implied to have taken flight, while in Revelation of the Daleks, a Dalek hovered to exterminate two victims. The {{first part of the}} 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks shows a Dalek who was clearly seen to hover up a flight of stairs to the Doctor's horror. Rose and Adam allude to a long-held fan joke about the Daleks' {{inability}} to climb <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> are horrified when it does so.|$|E

5|$|A major {{contributor}} to the faults lay in Siemen's 1992 take-over of MaK, in which {{a large number of}} veteran employees, who had the necessary competence to build diesel-locomotives, were retired. In 1998, Siemens sold the Kiel facilities to Vossloh. Following the return to Germany, the locomotives were modified to meet German standards and designed ME26. They were made narrower by removing outside <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> railings, and moving lights to meet International Union of Railways standards. There were also changes to the cab walls, with internal railings added and the toilets removed. The speed was also reduced to , although this has later been reverted. Number 664 was rebuilt in Kiel, but {{because of the lack of}} capacity at MaK, the remaining units were rebuilt by DSB in Copenhagen. After the upgrades, ownership was transferred to Dispolok, a leasing pool originally owned by Siemens.|$|E
5|$|After 1:00pm on 30 April 1945, Braun and Hitler {{said their}} farewells to staff {{and members of}} the inner circle. Later that afternoon, at {{approximately}} 3:30pm, several people reported hearing a loud gunshot. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, and Hitler's SS adjutant, Otto Günsche, entered the small study and found the lifeless bodies of Hitler and Braun on a small sofa. Braun had bitten into a cyanide capsule, and Hitler had shot himself in the right temple with his pistol. The corpses were carried up the <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> through the bunker's emergency exit to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were burned. Braun was 33 years old when she died.|$|E

5|$|An {{analysis}} of the Concealed Shoe Index maintained by Northampton Museum, conducted by June Swann and published in 1996, reveals that the most common place of concealment is the chimney, fireplace or hearth (26.2 per cent), followed by under the floor or above the ceiling (22.9 per cent), and almost as many concealed in the roof. Shoes have also been found around doors and windows, under the <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> among the foundations. Concealed shoes have been discovered in many types of building: country cottages, town houses, manor houses, hospitals, workhouses, factories, public houses, and two Oxford colleges, St John's and Queen's. They have even been found in ecclesiastical buildings, including a Benedictine monastery in Germany and a Baptist church in Cheshire, England.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.|$|E
5|$|Dual Destinies {{features}} animated cutscenes {{produced by}} the animation studio Bones, which were directed by Seto at Capcom and Kenji Nagasaki at Bones. The scripts for these were drafted by Yamazaki, and included characters' lines {{as well as the}} general events and backgrounds for each scene. After the scripts were written, they were sent to Nagasaki, who drew storyboards for the scenes. When boarding the sequences, he added suggestions for details and nuances; for instance, in the script for one scene, Athena was going to trip and fall over, while Nagasaki suggested and boarded her tumbling down <b>stairs,</b> <b>and</b> added a guard character for her to interact with {{at the end of the}} scene to emphasize how painful the fall had been. After finalizing the scene, the team at Bones worked on the background art; while the courtrooms and defendant lobbies are shown in-game, the courthouse's stairway and main hall had not been shown before, and had to be designed specifically for the cutscenes.|$|E

5|$|During one of {{the work}} parties, Stanley was sent to build a road and stairs leading to a {{memorial}} to the Japanese dead on Bukit Batok Hill (Marked with a Bukit Batok Memorial plaque today, only the <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> road called Lorong Sesuai are still there to be seen). The chaplain of the regiment, well aware of Stanley's religious conviction and artistic background, requested him to decorate the asbestos walls at the altar area of a small open attap-roofed chapel at Bukit Batok. With charcoal salvaged from around the camp, he drew two murals: Nativity, which featured a Malay Madonna and Descent from the Cross in which he included soldiers in uniforms, using his comrades as models. By then, he was becoming ill and was suffering from a severe renal disorder complicated by amoebic dysentery. On 23 May 1942, Stanley was lying comatose and was sent to Roberts Barracks in Changi which was converted {{for use as a}} hospital for POWs to recuperate.|$|E

While horrified, Ellen is then attacked by the possessed Bruce. Ellen manages to trap Bruce outside, stabbing Bruce's hand {{several times in the}} process. The bleeding Scotty tells Ellen to look into the cellar for the gun they brought along. While walking {{down the stairs to the}} cellar, she trips on a broken step and injures herself. After finding the gun, she goes back up <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> discovers that Scotty had been stabbed to death while she was downstairs. The demonic Bruce then attacks her, but she manages to cut off his hand.|$|E
5|$|Following the station's opening, Downtown Flushing {{evolved into}} a major {{commercial}} and transit center, as development sprung around the section of Main Street near the station. On April 24, 1939, express trains began operating {{to and from the}} station, in conjunction with the reconstruction of the Willets Point station for the 1939 World's Fair. Due to the high level of passenger use, beginning in 1940 local residents requested an additional exit at the east end of the station, and the widening of existing staircases. A new eastern entrance was added after World War II. Ground broke on the new entrance on November 5, 1947, and it opened on October 28, 1948 with two new street <b>stairs</b> <b>and</b> an additional token booth. Upon its initial opening, the new entrance did little to relieve crowding at the main fare control area.|$|E
