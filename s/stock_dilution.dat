40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the relation between share repurchases and stock options. In fact, certain studies demonstrate that the development of stock option plans since the beginning of the 1990 s is also considered one explanation for the increase in equity programs for repurchasing shares. We have tested the validity of our hypothesis on a sample of 77 French firms listed during the 2003 - 2008 period. The results demonstrate a positive link between the performance of near future exercise of employee stock options and share repurchases. The desire to avoid the dilution associated with the performance of stock options can thus be one of the motives for making share repurchases. The results subsequently demonstrate that directors holding a substantial number of stock options encourage companies to make share repurchases. On the other hand, we detected a negative relationship between the existence of managerial stock options and the augmentation of dividends.

The genetic and antigenic variability of EV 71 strains isolated in Taiwan in 1998 – 2005 was evaluated using partial nucleotide sequence analysis of the VP 1 gene and the neutralisation assay.

Between 1999 and 2003, isolates belonging to sub-genogroup B 4 predominated, followed by a change to sub-genogroup C 4 in 2004 and 2005.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the findings of}} the authors' recent survey of 392 CFOs about the current practice of corporate finance, with main focus on the areas of capital budgeting and capital structure. The findings of the survey are predictable in some respects but surprising in others. For example, although the discounted cash flow method taught in our business schools is much more widely used as a project evaluation method than it was ten or 20 years ago, the popularity of the payback method continues despite shortcomings that have been pointed out for years. In setting capital structure policy, CFOs appear to place less emphasis on formal leverage targets that reflect the trade-off between {{the costs and benefits of}} debt than on "informal" criteria such as credit ratings and financial flexibility.

The revised method also incorporates polysorbate 80 {{in the test}} medium to mitigate drug binding to plastics. This revised methodology provides more accurate and reproducible MIC determinations, which results in values lower than the previously established method. This {{study was conducted to}} re-establish telavancin potencies and susceptibility profiles (using updated interpretive criteria) against a collection of uncommon clinical pathogens (3821 isolates). Telavancin showed MIC 50 values of 0. 06 mg/L against tested staphylococcal species (MIC 50 / 90, 0. 03 / 0. 06 mg/L; 98. 1 – 100. 0 % susceptible), with lower results for Staphylococcus hominis (MIC 50, ≤ 0. 015 mg/L), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (MIC 50, ≤ 0. 015 mg/L) and Staphylococcus simulans (MIC 50, 0. 03 mg/L). Vancomycin (MIC 50, 1 mg/L), daptomycin (MIC 50, 0. 12 – 1 mg/L) and linezolid (MIC 50, 0. 25 – 1 mg/L) had MIC 50 results at least four-fold higher than telavancin against CoNS. Streptococci (99. 2 – 100. 0 % susceptible) displayed telavancin MIC 50 values of ≤ 0. 015 – 0. 03 mg/L. Vancomycin (MIC 50, 0. 25 – 0. 5 mg/L) and linezolid (MIC 50, 0. 5 – 1 mg/L) had higher MIC 50 results against streptococci, whilst daptomycin MIC 50 values varied from ≤ 0. 06 mg/L to 0. 5 mg/L. Micrococcus, Listeria and Corynebacterium spp. were inhibited by telavancin at ≤ 0. 015, ≤ 0. 03 and ≤ 0. 06 mg/L, respectively. Telavancin exhibited potent in vitro activity against this collection, greater than comparators (daptomycin, linezolid, vancomycin).

50|$|The {{advantages}} of public trading status include {{the possibility of}} commanding a higher price for a later offering of the company's securities.

40|$|After {{years of}} debate, {{employee}} stock option compensation expense is finally reported in published financial statements.

50|$|<b>Stock</b> <b>dilution,</b> {{also known}} as equity dilution, is the {{decrease}} in existing shareholders’ ownership of a company {{as a result of}} the company issuing new equity. New equity increases the total shares outstanding which has a dilutive effect on the ownership percentage of existing shareholders. This increase in the number of shares outstanding can result from a primary market offering (including an initial public offering), employees exercising stock options, or by issuance or conversion of convertible bonds, preferred shares or warrants into stock. This dilution can shift fundamental positions of the stock such as ownership percentage, voting control, earnings per share, and the value of individual shares.
