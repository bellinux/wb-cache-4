5|$|Individual {{components}} of the 19S particle have their own regulatory roles. Gankyrin, a recently identified oncoprotein, {{is one of the}} 19S <b>subcomponents</b> that also tightly binds the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4 and {{plays a key role in}} recognizing ubiquitinated p53, via its affinity for the ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Gankyrin is anti-apoptotic and has been shown to be overexpressed in some tumor cell types such as hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Only recently, the {{assembly}} {{process of the}} 19S regulatory particle has been elucidated to considerable extent. The 19S regulatory particle assembles as two distinct <b>subcomponents,</b> the base and the lid. Assembly of the base complex is facilitated by four assembly chaperones, Hsm3/S5b, Nas2/p27, Rpn14/PAAF1, and Nas6/gankyrin (names for yeast/mammals). These assembly chaperones bind to the AAA-ATPase subunits and their main function {{seems to be to}} ensure proper assembly of the heterohexameric AAA-ATPase ring. To date it is still under debate whether the base complex assembles separately, whether {{the assembly}} is templated by the 20S core particle, or whether alternative assembly pathways exist. In addition to the four assembly chaperones, the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6/Usp14 also promotes base assembly, but it is not essential. The lid assembles separately in a specific order and does not require assembly chaperones.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} <b>subcomponents</b> {{are often}} referred to by their Svedberg sedimentation coefficient (denoted S). The proteasome most exclusively used in mammals is the cytosolic 26S proteasome, which is about 2000 kilodaltons (kDa) in molecular mass containing one 20S protein subunit and two 19S regulatory cap subunits. The core is hollow and provides an enclosed cavity in which proteins are degraded; openings at the two ends of the core allow the target protein to enter. Each end of the core particle associates with a 19S regulatory subunit that contains multiple ATPase active sites and ubiquitin binding sites; it is this structure that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins and transfers them to the catalytic core. An alternative form of regulatory subunit called the 11S particle can associate with the core in essentially {{the same manner as}} the 19S particle; the 11S {{may play a role in}} degradation of foreign peptides such as those produced after infection by a virus.|$|E

5|$|The British public {{first saw}} the Spitfire at the RAF Hendon air-display on Saturday 27 June 1936. Although {{full-scale}} production was supposed to begin immediately, there were numerous problems {{that could not be}} overcome for some time, and the first production Spitfire, K9787, did not roll off the Woolston, Southampton assembly line until mid-1938. The first and most immediate problem was that the main Supermarine factory at Woolston was already working at full capacity fulfilling orders for Walrus and Stranraer flying boats. Although outside contractors were supposed to be involved in manufacturing many important Spitfire components, especially the wings, Vickers-Armstrong (the parent company) was reluctant to see the Spitfire being manufactured by outside concerns, and was slow to release the necessary blueprints and <b>subcomponents.</b> As a result of the delays in getting the Spitfire into full production, the Air Ministry put forward a plan that production of the Spitfire be stopped after the initial order for 310, after which Supermarine would build Bristol Beaufighters. The managements of Supermarine and Vickers were able to convince the Air Ministry that the problems could be overcome, and further orders were placed for 200 Spitfires on 24 March 1938. The two orders covered the K, L and N prefix serial numbers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} cooperative co-evolutionary (CC) algorithms on large-scale fully-separable continuous optimization problems. We have shown that decomposition can have {{significant impact on the}} perfor-mance of CC algorithms. The empirical results show that the <b>subcomponent</b> size should be chosen small enough so that the <b>subcomponent</b> size is within the capacity of the <b>subcomponent</b> optimizer. In practice, determining the optimal size is difficult. Therefore, adaptive techniques are desired by practitioners. Here we propose an adaptive method, MLSoft, that uses widely-used techniques in reinforcement learning such as the value function method and softmax selection rule to adapt the <b>subcomponent</b> size during the optimization process. The experimental results show that MLSoft is significantly better than an existing adaptive algorithm called MLCC on a set of large-scale fully-separable problems. I...|$|R

25|$|One highly {{influential}} {{theory of}} WM is the Baddeley and Hitch multi-component model of working memory. The most recent {{version of this}} model {{suggests that there are}} four <b>subcomponents</b> to WM, namely the phonological loop; the visuo-spatial sketchpad; the central executive; and the episodic buffer. One component of this model, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, is said to be responsible for the temporary storage, maintenance, and manipulation of both visual and spatial information.|$|E
25|$|Logie (1995) {{proposed}} that the visuo-spatial sketchpad is broken down into two <b>subcomponents,</b> one visual and one spatial. These are the visual cache and the inner scribe, respectively. The visual cache is a temporary visual store including such dimensions as colour and shape. Conversely, the inner scribe is a rehearsal mechanism for visual information and is responsible for information concerning movement sequences. Although {{a general lack of}} consensus regarding this distinction has been noted in the literature, there is a growing amount of evidence that the two components are separate and serve different functions.|$|E
40|$|The basic {{principle}} of Maneuver Warfare in the 21 st century is the seamless integration of sea and land as maneuver space. Unfortunately, {{our inability to}} conduct countermine and counterobstacle operations in the littorals severely curtails our ability to conduct Amphibious Warfare, a key ingredient to maneuver. Hydra- 7, a possible solution to this problem, {{is one of the}} most promising countermine weapons under development, but its final performance level will depend on the effectiveness of <b>subcomponent</b> technologies. These <b>subcomponent</b> technologies have yet to reach maturity and may not perform as well as desired.

25|$|Traditionally, Wolverhampton's {{economy has}} been {{dominated}} by iron, steel, automobiles, engineering and manufacturing industries. Many of the traditional industries in the city have closed or dramatically downsized over the years. However, by 2008 the economy was dominated by the service sector, with 74.9% of the city's employment being in this area. The major <b>subcomponents</b> of this sector are in public administration, education and health (32.8% of the total employment), while distribution, hotels and restaurants take up 21.1%, and finance and IT takes up 12.7%. The largest non-service industry was that of manufacturing (12.9%), whilst 5.2% of the total employment is related to the tourism industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{free market}} {{viewpoint}} defines economic liberty as {{the freedom to}} produce, trade and consume any goods and services acquired {{without the use of}} force, fraud or theft. This is embodied in the rule of law, property rights and freedom of contract, and characterized by external and internal openness of the markets, the protection of property rights and freedom of economic initiative. There are several indices of economic freedom that attempt to measure free market economic freedom. Empirical studies based on these rankings have found higher living standards, economic growth, income equality, less corruption and less political violence to be correlated with higher scores on the country rankings. It has been argued that the economic freedom indices conflate together unrelated policies and policy outcomes to conceal negative correlations between economic growth and economic freedom in some <b>subcomponents.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1963 {{a replica}} of Bluenose was built at Lunenburg using the {{original}} Bluenose plans and named Bluenose II. The replica was built by Smith and Rhuland, sponsored by the Oland Company. Used as a marketing tool for Oland Brewery Schooner Lager beer brand and as a pleasure yacht for the Olands family. Bluenose II was sold {{to the government of}} Nova Scotia in 1971 for the sum of $1 or 10 Canadian dimes. The replica schooner is used for tourism promotion as a [...] "sailing ambassador". In honour of her predecessor's racing record, Bluenose II does not officially race. The replica has undergone several refits to extend her life. This vessel was decommissioned and dismantled in 2010, and an entirely new Bluenose (also named Bluenose II, since Transport Canada deemed it a [...] "reconstruction") was built as close to the original schooner deemed necessary and launched in Lunenburg in 2013. Various <b>subcomponents</b> for this Bluenose II project were supplied from notable firms including the ships keel at Snyder's Shipyard in Dayspring, the ships backbone of laminated ribs at Covey Island Boatworks in Riverport and assembly of the vessel in Lunenburg. The vessel is currently tied up at the Lunenburg Foundry wharf in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. Much controversy has surrounded the vessel due to over spending on the [...] "refit" [...] and falsified documents. After further repairs ownership of the restored Bluenose II was returned to the province of Nova Scotia and she began a tour of Nova Scotia ports in the summer of 2015.|$|E
