5|$|Remains of the nilgai {{dating back}} to the Pleistocene have been {{discovered}} from the Kurnool caves in southern India. Evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were hunted by humans during the Mesolithic period (5,000 to 8,000 years ago).|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus {{is among}} the most easily {{identifiable}} dinosaurs, with its typical sauropod shape, long neck and tail, and four sturdy legs. For many years, it was the longest dinosaur known. Its great size may have been a deterrent to the predators Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus: their remains have been found in the same strata, which <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> coexisted with Diplodocus.|$|E
50|$|As {{their sons}} grew up, they {{soon began to}} grow tired {{of living in a}} cramped up space, forever in darkness. One brother, Tūmatūenga, the God of War and Humans, <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> slay their parents. However, his brother, Tāne, the God of Forests, <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{separate}} their parents forever.|$|R

However, he is discouraged by his father at the last minute, and stands Blair up.|$|E
5|$|Though {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} ungainly and awkward when on the ground, {{the anatomy of}} some pterosaurs (particularly pterodactyloids) <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were competent walkers and runners. Early pterosaurs have long been considered particularly cumbersome locomotors due {{to the presence of}} large cruropatagia, but they too appear to have been generally efficient on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Three sumptuous tombs {{found at}} Apahida {{evidence}} the wealth accumulated by Gepid royals through their {{connections with the}} Eastern Roman Empire. A golden ring with crosses found {{in one of the}} graves implies its owner's Christian faith. John of Biclar refers to an Arian bishop of the Gepids which <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> adopted Christianity through their connection with the Arian Goths.|$|E

5|$|A {{comparison}} of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The {{one on the}} left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E
5|$|Archeologists {{believe the}} first humans to inhabit the Rogue River region were nomadic hunters and gatherers. Radiocarbon dating <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> arrived in southwestern Oregon at least 8,500 years ago. At least 1,500 {{years before the}} first contact with whites, the natives {{established}} permanent villages along streams. Even so, no evidence {{has been found to}} suggest that any of the native peoples, such as the Takelma who lived along the Rogue and Applegate rivers in the 19thcentury, used the cave.|$|E
5|$|Around 1844, {{she married}} a free black man named John Tubman. Although {{little is known about}} him or their time together, the union was {{complicated}} because of her slave status. Since the mother's status dictated that of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages – free people of color marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.|$|E

5|$|At the Greene farm, Hershel {{reveals that}} Carl needs major surgery to live, {{and that he}} will need a respirator. Otis <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might find {{supplies}} at a nearby high school—where the Federal Emergency Management Agency has set up a trailer—although the place is likely overrun with walkers. Otis and Shane decide to get the supplies, while Maggie retrieves Lori from the group and brings her to the Greene home. Rick and Hershel discuss the walker epidemic; Rick believes there is no cure, while Hershel has faith that there could be one.|$|E
5|$|At {{the mouth}} of the Rogue River, along the coast of Curry County, is the Otter Point Formation, a mélange of metamorphosed {{sedimentary}} rocks such as shales, sandstones, and chert. Although the rocks formed in the Jurassic, evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> faulted north as part of the Gold Beach Terrane after the Klamaths merged with North America. Oregon's only dinosaur fragments, those of a hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaur, were found here. In the mid-1960s, a geologist also discovered the beak and teeth of an ichthyosaur in the Otter Point Formation.|$|E

In that time, Orson <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> enter marriage counseling, but Bree insists that she no longer sees herself as his wife, but rather his captive. Realizing that guilt is a small price for happiness, Bree reignites her affair with Karl.|$|E

5|$|Caroline Island is {{believed}} to have originated from a volcanic hotspot which eroded and then became home to a coral reef which grew above the ocean surface. Although these geological processes are poorly understood, the orientation of the Line Islands (roughly north-south) <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were formed more than 40 million years ago, before the Pacific Plate changed its direction of travel. The same hotspot more recently gave rise to the Tuamotu Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) confides in Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{that she}} is {{intending}} to stay in Tallahassee. Ryan interprets this as an invitation {{to hook up with}} her, so he attempts to seduce her by taking her to the empty kitchen to help her make a waffle. They hide under a table when the chefs return. After Ryan compliments Erin, she <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could become roommates in Florida and possibly start dating in six months if things go well between them. Not wanting that long timeline, he resorts to saying he loves Kelly.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} fossil record of bats extends over 50 million years, their fossils are {{extremely}} rare. The fossil record of the greater noctule in the Iberian Peninsula <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> lived at different geographical locations from that of today. The fossils of greater noctule are almost non-existent prior to the Miocene epoch. The deterioration of the climate {{at the end of}} Neogene led to the disappearance of tropical species and vespertilionids profited by accessing a wider range of habitats.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} stop the Man in Black from leaving the island, Richard <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> destroy the Ajira plane. After Ilana is killed while holding dynamites, Frank goes to the Black Rock with the group {{in order to get}} more dynamite. However, Hurley blows up the ship in order to prevent anymore risks; {{destroying}} all the dynamite supplies. After Hurley tells of his plan to talk to the Man in Black and Richard goes with his plan to destroy the plane, Frank joins Hurley, along with Jack, and Sun. Their group then merge with the Man in Black's camp.|$|E
5|$|Living asteroids, the Neoasteroidea, are morphologically {{distinct}} from their forerunners in the Paleozoic. The taxonomy {{of the group}} is relatively stable but there is ongoing debate {{about the status of}} the Paxillosida, and the deep-water sea daisies, though clearly Asteroidea and currently included in Velatida, do not fit easily in any accepted lineage. Phylogenetic data <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may be a sister group, the Concentricycloidea, to the Neoasteroidea, or that the Velatida themselves may be a sister group.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises eat a {{wide variety}} of creatures. The stomach {{contents}} of harbour porpoises <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.|$|E
