500|$|Back at Elsinore, Hamlet {{explains}} to Horatio {{that he had}} discovered Claudius's letter with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's belongings {{and replaced it with}} a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead. A foppish courtier, Osric, interrupts the conversation to deliver the fencing challenge to Hamlet. Hamlet, despite Horatio's pleas, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of wine Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her, but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius's plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor. Horatio, distraught at the thought of being the last survivor and living whilst Hamlet does not, says he will commit suicide by drinking the dregs of Gertrude's poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live on and tell his story. Hamlet dies in Horatio's arms, proclaiming [...] "the rest is silence". [...] Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching towards Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's deaths. Horatio promises to recount the full <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> and Fortinbras, seeing the entire Danish royal family dead, takes the crown for himself, and orders a military funeral to honor Hamlet.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the struggles}} with the strike, co-executive producer/staff writer Adam Horowitz recounted this as [...] "a {{satisfying}} episode to work on—it was like we'd been waiting so long to tell the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> with Michael." [...] Carlton Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] felt that the audience deserved to know, you know, once he and Walt sailed off in the boat, what was their journey." [...] Supervising producer/writer Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "Michael's goal—the whole season—is to die and he gets an opportunity to redeem himself when [...] finds him." [...] Co-executive producer/staff writer Edward Kitsis added that [...] "It's heartbreaking when Walt wouldn't see [...] … I always respected {{the fact that he}} told his son about the murders … Even though he knew it would probably blow up their relationship, he wanted to be honest with his son. In a way, you've got to respect that." [...] Harold Perrineau, who plays Michael, concluded that [...] "He's done some bad things and he's you know, got himself into a messy situation, {{but at the end of}} the day, Michael's a good guy." [...] Instead of being intercut with scenes from the main ongoing plot, the flashbacks of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] are presented continuously and are only bookended by present-day scenes. This is the second episode to do this after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. The flashback portion of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] is the longest in Lost history; Horowitz stated that [...] "As we were breaking the story, it just happened, and it turned into the longest flashback to date." [...] When asked why Michael's alias was not an allusion to a literary or historical figure, as with other Lost characters, Damon Lindelof explained that [...] "if the Others … had chosen … Darwin or … Dickens, then … Widmore would have gotten suspicious: he'd go like, 'oh, now there's somebody on my boat with a literary allusion in their name, which sounds very much like that's a Benjamin Linus alias', so they picked the most innocuous name they possibly could, which was Kevin Johnson." [...] Lindelof also said that it was a coincidence that [...] "Kevin Johnson" [...] was also the name of an American basketball player.|$|E

2500|$|Critics say {{the absurdity}} of Plan 9 from Outer Space {{is found in the}} {{dialogue}} rather than on-screen action.
