40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{properties}} of a medium-carbon steel with the ultrafine (α+θ) microstructures obtained by hot deformation of undercooled austenite and annealing were investigated by tensile tests, {{in comparison with}} that of a eutectoid steel. The results indicated {{that in the case of}} hot deformation of undercooled austenite to strain of 1. 61 at 650 °C at 0. 01 s- 1 and annealing at 650 °C for 30 min, the ultrafine (α+θ) microstructures consisting of ultrafine ferrite grains and dispersed cementite particles were similar in the medium-carbon steel and the eutectoid steel, but the mechanical {{properties of}} the eutectoid steel were better that maybe be attributed to the relatively coarser size and the higher amount of cementite particles. With the increase of temperature for hot deformation of undercooled austenite to 700 °C, the ultrafine (α+θ) microstructure of the medium-carbon steel changed obviously with the presence of some <b>spheroidized</b> <b>pearlite</b> colonies, and demonstrated the best balance of strength and elongation, the yield strength of about 545 MPa, the tensile strength of about 635 MPa, and the total elongation of about 35 %...|$|E
40|$|We {{made two}} kinds of {{experiments}} about this subject: for the first experiment, a number of structures of thin-walled cylindrical specimens of various carbon steels were made by heat treatment. From the stress-strain curves of these specimens drawn by the pendulum type torsion testing machine, the Bauschinger effect was estimated and the following results were gained. 　 1) In general, the less carbon is contained in the specimens, the less remarkably the Bauschinger effect is observed. Even in the annealed Flodin iron, the transient softening and the permanent softening are clearly seen when the order of 3 per cent shear prestrain is added. 　The Bauschinger effect of carbon steels depends {{not only on the}} carbon contained but greatly on other impurities. The Bauschinger effect decreases when the ferrite crystals of the specimen show an axial fibre structure. It can be said that the Bauschinger effect of carbon steels is made remarkable when the structure of the steels is complicated macroscopically or microscopically or both. 　 2) The permanent softening curves are higher than the stless-strain curves of the virgin specimens when the Bauschinger effect is less appreciable, but this is revealed just contrary when the Bauschinger effect is remarkable. This shows that the work-hardening occurs both in the pre-strained direction and in the reverse direction simultaniously, containing the causes of the Bauschinger effect in the reverse direction. 　 3) When the comparatively small prestrain, under 5 per cent, being applied to the specimens, the Bauschinger effect of carbon steels is linearlly proporitonal to the amount of prestrains. The rate of increase of the Bauschinger effect with the prestrain of specimens is proportional to the ”r” power (r > 1) of the coefficient of work-hardening of the last part of prestrain curves. 　 4) The Bauschinger effect of carbon steels can be partly removed by low temperature ageing but cannot be completely removed before recrystallization, {{and in the course of}} its removal, though the Cottrell atmosphere is formed, sharp yielding is not always observed if the Bauschinger effect is pronounced. In this case the preyielding often appears in the same deformation as that of prestrain. 　 5) The Bauschinger effect of specimens with <b>spheroidized</b> <b>pearlite</b> structure is revealed smaller than that of fully annealed same specimens. The difference between these two Bauschinger effects becomes more remarkable as the spheroidization of cementite is promoted. This is due to the fact that the coefficient of work-hardening of prestrain of the specimens with <b>spheroidized</b> <b>pearlite</b> is smaller than that of the fully annealed same specimens. 　 6) With the carbon steel with <b>spheroidized</b> <b>pearlite,</b> the Bauschinger effect is more difficult to remove by low temperature ageing under 200 ℃ than the same carbon steel of the annealed structure, in spite of the Bauschinger effect of the former being smaller than the latter as mentioned in (5). A sharp yielding in the reverse direction does not return to the pre-strained spheroidized carbon steel unless it is aged above 200 ℃. 　 7) For the annealed specimen, the activation energy obtained by the process of raising the lower yielding point till the first saturation, with the removal of the Bauschinger effect by ageing at around l 00 ℃, was 19, 000 cal/mole, and for the specimens with <b>spheroidized</b> <b>pearlite,</b> the activation energy of the same process with ageing at around 220 ℃ was 24, 000 cal/mole. 　 8) When the constant amplitude of stresses ±t_ 0 is repeated, the permanent strain with the opposite sign to the prestrain is not observed in the specimens which show a little Bauschinger effect, but in the specimens in which the Bauschinger effect is remarkably shown, the permanent strain with the opposite sign presents itself. 　 9) When ±t_ 0 is repeated, the width of the stress-strain hysteresis loop and the Bauschinger effect diminish remarkably at the second repition and then they diminish gradually to attain certain values after several repitions. But the effect of the prior deformation appears on the work-hardening and the Bauschinger effect of the subsequent stress-strain curves at least in the first few cycles of stressing. 　 10) Applying the prestrain, which is greater than the yield strain of the specimen, we repeated 10 cycles of constant amplitude of stress ±t_ 0 which were equal to the last stress of prestrain, and aged it. A sharp yielding returned in the positive direction. Though in the reverse direction the proportional limit rose somewhat, sharp yielding did not appear at all. If we begin with the same order of prestrain and ageing as above, but fail to apply the stress repetition, sharp yielding should appear in the reverse direction, and if the stress is repeated, the Bauschinger strain should be smaller than that of the pre-strained specimen as mentioned in (9). 　For the second experiments, the fully annealed cylindrical specimens of low carbon steel were given 4. 3...|$|E
40|$|A {{confined}} aqueous {{environment is}} defined by a very low water-volume to exposed steel-area ratio. In such media containing dissolved CO 2, siderite is formed and acts as a protective film. An addition of applied stress and/or environmental fluctuation can disturb the balance between the steel and this protective film, causing the fracture of the latter and leading to Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC). The material studied is a cold drawn and rolled high strength steel composed of ferrite and <b>spheroidized</b> <b>pearlite</b> and has a strong microstructural anisotropy due to the specific cold work process. To investigate its susceptibility to SCC, Slow Strain Rate Tests (SSRT) were carried out on smooth and notched specimens allowing to separate crack initiation and crack propagation. The environment is an aqueous chloride solution saturated in CO 2 at pH around 6. Tests were performed under open circuit potential (OCP) and at cathodic potential. Under OCP, localized anodic dissolution in shear bands is responsible for crack initiation. Under cathodic potential, crack initiation is delayed due {{to the absence of}} critical defect on the surface. Both fractographic analyses and results obtained on notched specimens showed that hydrogen {{plays an important role in}} crack propagation...|$|E
40|$|Influence of {{austenitization}} {{temperature of}} chrome-molybdenum-vanadium steel on structure formation at the softening heat treatment is studied. It is {{shown that the}} decline of the austenitization temperature promotes to reduce the micro-hardness values due to the intensification of <b>spheroidizing</b> of <b>pearlite</b> after the overcooling and high tempering. Increasing the austenitization temperature leads to formation of an uneven structure after tempering...|$|R
40|$|Convergent beam Kikuchi line {{diffraction}} patterns, {{which have}} an accuracy {{more than an}} order of magnitude better than the more widely used conventional selected area diffraction, have been used to determine the orientation relationship between cementite and the ferrite matrix in spheroidite and tempered martensite. It has been shown that when <b>pearlite</b> <b>spheroidized</b> in plain carbon eutectoid steel, the original orientation relationship between cementite and ferrite is maintained in some cases. In other pearlite colonies in the later stages of the spheroidization the cementite particles rotate into a different orientation relationship with respect to the surrounding ferrite. In twinned martensite tempered in the range 450 - 650 °C, the Isaichev orientation relationship between ferrite and cementite is obeyed, until recrystallization of the ferrite occurs. After full recrystallization the strict orientation relationship is destroyed, but the cementite particles still maintain a pseudo orientation relationship, in which close packed planes are approximately parallel, while the angle between corresponding close packed directions varies widely...|$|R
