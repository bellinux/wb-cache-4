40|$|The {{medicinal}} {{value of}} hydrogen (H 2) was ignored prior to research illustrating that inhalation of 2 % H 2 can significantly decrease the damage of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion caused by oxidative stress via selective elimination of hydroxyl freebase (OH) and peroxynitrite anion (ONOOˉ). Subsequently, {{there have been}} numerous experiments on H 2. Most research and trials involving the mechanisms underlying H 2 therapy show the effects of antioxygenation, anti-inflammation, and anti-apoptosis. Among quantities of diseases related with H 2 therapy, the brain disease is a hotspot as brain tissue and cell damage are easier to be induced by oxidative stress and other stimulations. In this review, emphasis is on stroke, traumatic brain injuries, and degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer′s disease and Parkinson′s disease. Taking into account the blood-brain barrier, penetrability, possible side effects, and the molecular properties of H 2 within a <b>single</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>review</b> should contribute to advancing both clinical and non-clinical research and therapies. A systematic introduction of H 2 therapy with regards to mechanisms and cerebral diseases both in animal and human subjects can make it easier to comprehend H 2 therapy and therefore provide the basis for further clinical strategy...|$|E
30|$|There {{are some}} {{interesting}} reviews already {{published in the}} literature. However they usually focus only on particular biological processes. An excellent review regarding the modeling of signaling pathways was elaborated by Aldridge et al. (2006). They address the model design process, as well as, model validation and calibration. They highlight the application of ODE and rule-based models, but do not mention other formalisms. Another recent review on the modeling of signaling networks {{can be found in}} Morris et al. (2010). Two remarkable reviews on the modeling of gene regulatory networks are presented by Schlitt and Brazma (2007) and by Karlebach and Shamir (2008). Both give examples of several applications of different formalisms for modeling this kind of networks. A few reviews with broader scope can also be found in the literature. Two excellent examples are Fisher and Henzinger (2007) and Materi and Wishart (2007). Both give a critical discussion on the application of different formalisms for computational modeling of cellular processes. The former covers Boolean networks, interacting state machines, Petri nets, process algebras and hybrid models, whereas the latter covers differential equations, Petri nets, cellular automata, agent-based models and process algebras. The lack of a <b>single</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>review</b> that compares a larger spectrum of formalisms motivated the development of this work.|$|E
40|$|Elm yellows (EY) is {{a lethal}} or decline phytoplasma disease that affects several Ulmus (elm) species and hybrids, which is {{widespread}} in North America and Europe. The symptoms vary among the elm species. In those native to North America, main symptoms include epinasty, chlorosis, premature casting of the leaves, yellow to brown discoloration of the phloem in {{the roots and}} stem and tree death that usually occurs within 1 or 2 years from the appearance of foliar symptoms. In contrast, affected trees of European and Asian species are primarily characterized by witches’ broom as a specific symptom, do not show phloem discoloration and are less prone to decline. The disease {{is caused by a}} relatively genetically homogeneous phytoplasma, the EY agent “Candidatus Phytoplasma ulmi,” a member of the EY phytoplasma group or 16 SrV group, subgroup 16 SrV-A. In nature, this pathogen exhibits a high plant host specificity. The elm leafhopper Scaphoideus luteolus is the only confirmed vector of EY phytoplasma in North America, whereas Macropsis mendax has been reported as a natural vector in Northern Italy. However, other insect vectors are likely to be involved in its natural spread. Phytoplasmas of other taxonomic groups or 16 SrV subgroups, which are known to infect a wide range of plant hosts, have been identified in naturally infected elm trees. However, the pathological relevance of these “non-elm” phytoplasmas needs to be confirmed in many cases. Their detection is mainly based on the highly sensitive nested PCR assays, while pathological data are lacking. This study summarizes, within the framework of a <b>single</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>review,</b> the current knowledge of EY. Gaps in knowledge of this disease and prospects for future research are also critically discussed...|$|E
