40|$|Previous self-consistent {{field theory}} (SCFT) {{calculations}} {{have predicted that}} the steric interaction between two polymer-grafted particles in good solvent can become attractive, but this conclusion has since been questioned. Here we reexamine the problem with a new numerical scheme using multiple coordinate systems, and find that the interaction remains repulsive regardless of the particle <b>size,</b> <b>brush</b> thickness, or particle separation. The erroneous attraction in the earlier calculations {{can be attributed to}} numerical inaccuracy and a subtle issue with how the chains were grafted to the particles. Using our corrected SCFT solution, we also investigate the accuracy of a previous calculation based on strong-stretching theory (SST) and the applicability of the Derjaguin approximation, where the interaction between large particles is estimated from the one-dimensional uniform compression of polymer brushes. close 585...|$|E
40|$|We used isotension-ensemble Monte Carlo {{simulations}} {{to study}} the properties of brush layers of bottle-brush polymers under lateral compression. The polymers were represented by a freely jointed hard-bead model with one side chain grafted to each bead of the main chain, and we considered variations in side-chain length and bead <b>size.</b> <b>Brush</b> properties, including brush height and surface pressure, were analyzed {{in the context of}} a generalized box model. The surface pressure was found to have a steeper dependence on the grafting density than predicted by classical theories of polymer brushes. This discrepancy could be traced to the equation of state of the polymer fluid composing the brush, which was found to be more reminiscent of the concentrated regime than of the semidilute conditions normally expected in polymer brushes. The conformational properties of individual polymer molecules were found to be insensitive to lateral compression; in particular, the side-chain end-to-end distance remained essentially constant...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} possible effects of chronic exposure to 900 - 1900 MHz radiations emitted from 2 G cell phone on kidney of mice at the histological level. Methods: Mice were exposed to 2 G ultra-high frequency radiation, 48 minutes per day {{for a period of}} 30 to 180 days. The amount of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposed was measured by radiation frequency meter. The sham control mice were subject to similar conditions without 2 G exposure. Six animals each were sacrificed at the end of 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 days of exposure in the experimental group after 24 hours of last exposure. Same numbers of control animals were sacrificed on similar period. Both kidneys were harvested and processed for histomorphometric study. Kidneys size, weight and volume were measured and analysed. Kidney sections were analysed under the light microscope and structural changes were studied. Results: In 2 G exposed group the kidney weight and volume was significantly reduced in the first month. Kidney weight alone was significantly increased in the fifth month. Glomerulus showed dilated capillaries and increased urinary space.
