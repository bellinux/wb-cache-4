50|$|The St. Vincent {{economy is}} heavily {{dependent}} on agriculture being the worldâ€™s leading producer of arrowroot and grows other exotic fruit, vegetables and root crops. Bananas alone account for upwards of 60% {{of the work force}} and 50% of merchandise exports. Such reliance on a <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> makes the <b>economy</b> vulnerable to external factors. St. Vincent's banana growers benefited from preferential access to the European market. In view of the European Union's announced phase-out of this preferred access, economic diversification is a priority.|$|R
40|$|We {{provide an}} {{analysis}} of a power maximising model for dictatorial behaviour. In the model, the dictator's revenues depend on the exports of a <b>single</b> <b>crop.</b> With the export earnings the dictator buys loyalty from the producers of the export crop by setting the domestic producer price. Revenues resulting from {{the difference between the}} international and the domestic price of the crop are used to finance a repressive apparatus. We present a complete comparative statics analysis of the choice between repression and loyalty to obtain power, in response to changes in the international price of the <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> in the <b>economy.</b> The results allow for a novel classification of power maximising behaviour into benevolent, tyrannical and totalitarian dictatorship. We argue that the model and the associated dictatorship typology can be embedded into Wintrobe's more general specification of a dictator's objective function, which combines aspirations for power with rent seeking motives. We confront our analysis with empirical observations on the Habyarimana regime in Rwanda (1973 - 1994). status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{establishment}} of British colonial administration brought {{the introduction of}} cash <b>crops</b> <b>economy</b> to Nigeria- as elsewhere in Africa. In line with the British colonial policy of providing raw materials for the industries of the metropolitan power, Nigeria witnessed the downplay {{of the importance of}} the indigenous economic system which made each family self-sufficient in food and other socio-economic needs. Through a deliberate policy of discouraging food crop cultivation, most clans and communities were gradually rid of food supplies and thus introduced into acute hunger in favour of the cultivation of cash crops needed by British industries. Local governments were used as agents of this destruction of the indigenous food <b>crop</b> <b>economy</b> and the vigorous pursuance of the new economic policy. This work focuses on this role of the local government authorities, with the local government in Benin Province as a case study...|$|R

50|$|Cotton is {{the most}} {{important}} <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> use for ethephon.

50|$|Crop {{rotation}} is {{the cornerstone}} pest control in the tropics. When a <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> is planted repeatedly in the same soil, insects and diseases that attack that crop are allowed to build up to unmanageable levels, greatly reducing the farmer's harvest.|$|R

50|$|Monocropping is the {{agricultural}} practice of growing a <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> {{year after year}} on the same land, {{in the absence of}} rotation through other crops or growing multiple crops on the same land (polyculture).

40|$|Mapping crop {{patterns}} with remote sensing data {{is of great}} importance for agricultural production, food security and agricultural sustainability. In this paper, a hierarchical clustering method was proposed to map cropping frequency from time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Indices (EVI) data and the spatial and temporal patterns of cropping frequency from 2001 to 2015 in Hubei Province of China were analyzed. The results are as follows: (1) The total double crop areas decreased slightly, while total <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> areas decreased significantly during 2001 and 2015; (2) The transfer between double <b>crop</b> and <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> was frequent in Hubei with about 11 ~ 15 % croplands changed their cropping frequency every 5 years; (3) The crop system has obvious regional differentiation for their change trend at the county level...|$|R

50|$|Intercropping can {{increase}} yields or reduce inputs and thus represents (potentially sustainable) agricultural intensification. However, while total yield per acre is often increased dramatically, yields of any <b>single</b> <b>crop</b> often diminish.

50|$|Intercropping is a {{multiple}} cropping practice involving growing {{two or more}} crops in proximity. The most common goal of intercropping is to produce a greater yield on a given piece of land by making use of resources or ecological processes that would otherwise not be utilized by a <b>single</b> <b>crop.</b>|$|R
