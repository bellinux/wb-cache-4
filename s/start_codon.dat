5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its <b>start</b> <b>codon</b> is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG <b>start</b> <b>codon</b> from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} organisms, pre-mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus, introns are spliced out, {{then the}} mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The small subunit of the ribosome usually starts by binding to {{one end of}} the mRNA and is joined there by various other eukaryotic initiation factors, forming the initiation complex. The initiation complex scans along the mRNA strand until it reaches a <b>start</b> <b>codon,</b> and then the large subunit of the ribosome attaches to the small subunit and translation of a protein begins. This entire process is referred to as gene expression; it is the process by which the information in a gene, encoded as a sequence of bases in DNA, is converted into the structure of a protein. A Morpholino can modify splicing or block translation, depending on the Morpholino's base sequence.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{are found}} in the 5' UTR of messenger RNA, upstream of a protein-coding gene. Here they are able to occlude the ribosome binding site (RBS) and prevent translation of the mRNA into protein. As temperature increases, the hairpin structure can 'melt' and expose the RBS or Shine-Dalgarno sequence to permit binding of the small ribosomal subunit (30S), which then assembles other translation machinery. The <b>start</b> <b>codon,</b> typically found 8 nucleotides downstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, signals the beginning of a protein-coding gene which is then translated to a peptide product by the ribosome. In addition to this cis-acting mechanism, a lone example of a trans-acting RNA thermometer has been found in RpoS mRNA where it is thought {{to be involved in the}} starvation response.|$|E

50|$|Alternative <b>start</b> <b>codons</b> are {{different}} from the standard AUG codon and are found in both prokaryotes (bacteria) and eukaryotes. Alternate <b>start</b> <b>codons</b> are still translated as Met when they are {{at the start of a}} protein (even if the codon encodes a different amino acid otherwise). This is because a separate transfer RNA (tRNA) is used for initiation.|$|R

40|$|Pairs of {{unidirectional}} (same strand) genes can {{overlap in}} one of two phases (relative reading frames). There is a striking bias in the relative abundance of prokaryotic gene overlaps in the two possible phases. A simple model is presented based on unidirectional gene overlaps evolving from nonoverlapping gene pairs, through the adoption of alternative <b>start</b> <b>codons</b> by the downstream genes. Potential alternative <b>start</b> <b>codons</b> within upstream gene sequences were found to occur at greater frequencies in one phase, corresponding to the most prevalent phase of gene overlaps.

50|$|Mitochondrial genomes (and prokaryotes) use {{alternate}} <b>start</b> <b>codons</b> {{more significantly}} (AUA and AUU in humans and mainly GUG and UUG in prokaryotes).|$|R
25|$|The small ribosomal subunit, {{typically}} {{bound to}} an aminoacyl-tRNA containing the amino acid methionine, binds to an AUG codon on the mRNA and recruits the large ribosomal subunit. The ribosome contains three RNA binding sites, designated A, P and E. The A site binds an aminoacyl-tRNA; the P site binds a peptidyl-tRNA (a tRNA {{bound to the}} peptide being synthesized); and the E site binds a free tRNA before it exits the ribosome. Protein synthesis begins at a <b>start</b> <b>codon</b> AUG near the 5' end of the mRNA. mRNA binds to the P site of the ribosome first. The ribosome is {{able to identify the}} <b>start</b> <b>codon</b> by use of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the mRNA in prokaryotes and Kozak box in eukaryotes.|$|E
25|$|The gene is {{expressed}} {{early in the}} development of the erythrocyte, specifically in the erythroid burst-forming unit and erythroid colony-forming unit.

25|$|In Figure 5, both ribosomal {{subunits}} (small and large) assemble at the <b>start</b> <b>codon</b> (towards the 5' {{end of the}} RNA). The ribosome uses RNA {{that matches}} the current codon (triplet) on the mRNA to append an amino acid to the polypeptide chain. This is done for each triplet on the RNA, while the ribosome moves towards the 3' end of the mRNA. Usually in bacterial cells, several ribosomes are working parallel on a single RNA, forming {{what is called a}} polyribosome or polysome.|$|E

25|$|The {{transcription}} {{initiation site}} of the CD36 gene has been mapped to 289 nucleotides upstream from the translational <b>start</b> <b>codon</b> and a TATA box and several putative cis regulatory regions lie further 5'. A binding site for PEBP2/CBF factors has been identified between -158 and -90 and disruption of this site reduces expression. The gene is the transcriptional control of the nuclear receptor PPAR/RXR heterodimer (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor – Retinoid X receptor) and gene expression can be up regulated using synthetic and natural ligands for PPAR and RXR, including the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic drugs and the vitamin A metabolite 9-cis-retinoic acid respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{promoter}} {{region for}} CCDC142 was identified using the El Dorado program at Genomatix, it spans bases 74482896–74483908 in chromosome 2. This 1013bp region spans 1071–58bp upstream of the <b>start</b> <b>codon</b> of CCDC142. There is a {{region in the}} promoter which binds {{a large number of}} Krueppel-like transcription factors and BED zinc-finger proteins. This region has no single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in it. Many of the transcription factors that bind to the promoter region of CCDC142 have functions dealing with tumor suppression, neurogenesis, DNA damage, and photoreception. This promoter region also contains a mammalian C-type LTR TATA box which overlaps with the transcription start site of the gene.|$|E
500|$|Translation {{starts with}} a chain-initiation codon or <b>start</b> <b>codon.</b> The start [...] codon alone is not {{sufficient}} to begin the process. Nearby sequences such as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in E. coli and initiation factors are also required to start translation. The most common <b>start</b> <b>codon</b> is AUG, which is read as methionine or, in bacteria, as formylmethionine. Alternative start codons depending on the organism include [...] "GUG" [...] or [...] "UUG"; these codons normally represent valine and leucine, respectively, but as start codons they are translated as methionine or formylmethionine.|$|E
50|$|Well-known coding {{regions that}} do not have AUG {{initiation}} codons are those of lacI (GUG) and lacA (UUG) in the E. coli lac operon. Two more recent studies have independently shown that 17 or more non-AUG <b>start</b> <b>codons</b> may initiate translation in E. coli.|$|R
50|$|The {{identification}} of RBS {{is used to}} determine the site of translation initiation in an unannotated sequence. This is referred to as N-terminal prediction.

500|$|Bound to the 5'-untranslated {{region of}} {{messenger}} RNA (mRNA), Morpholinos {{can interfere with}} progression of the ribosomal initiation complex from the 5' cap to the <b>start</b> <b>codon.</b> This prevents translation of the coding region of the targeted transcript (called [...] "knocking down" [...] gene expression). This is useful experimentally when an investigator wishes to know the function of a particular protein; Morpholinos provide a convenient means of knocking down expression of the protein and learning how that knockdown changes the cells or organism. Some Morpholinos knock down expression so effectively that, after degradation of preexisting proteins, the targeted proteins become undetectable by Western blot.|$|E
500|$|A codon {{is defined}} by the initial {{nucleotide}} from which translation starts and sets the frame for a run of successive triplets, which is known as an [...] "open reading frame" [...] (ORF). For example, the string GGGAAACCC, if read from the first position, contains the codons GGG, AAA, and CCC; if read from the second position, it contains the codons GGA and AAC; and if read from the third position, GAA and ACC. Every sequence can, thus, be read in its 5' → 3' direction in three reading frames, each producing a possibly distinct amino acid sequence (in the given example, Gly-Lys-Pro, Gly-Asn, or Glu-Thr, respectively). DNA is double-stranded defining six possible reading frames, three in the forward orientation on one strand and three reverse on the opposite strand. Protein-coding frames are defined by a <b>start</b> <b>codon,</b> usually the first AUG codon in the sequence.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{computer}} programs capable of translating a DNA/RNA sequence into a protein sequence. Normally this {{is performed using}} the Standard Genetic Code, however, few programs can handle all the [...] "special" [...] cases, {{such as the use}} of the alternative initiation codons. For instance, the rare alternative <b>start</b> <b>codon</b> CTG codes for Methionine when used as a <b>start</b> <b>codon,</b> and for Leucine in all other positions.|$|E
500|$|Variations on the {{standard}} code were predicted in the 1970s. The first was discovered in 1979, by researchers studying human mitochondrial genes. Many slight variants were discovered thereafter, including various alternative mitochondrial codes. Small variants such as translation of the codon UGA as tryptophan in Mycoplasma species, and translation of CUG as a serine rather than leucine in yeasts of the [...] "CTG clade" [...] (such as Candida albicans). Because viruses must use the same genetic code as their hosts, modifications to {{the standard}} genetic code could interfere with viral protein synthesis or functioning. However, viruses such as totiviruses adapted to the host's genetic code modification. In bacteria and archaea, GUG and UUG are common <b>start</b> <b>codons.</b> In rare cases, certain proteins may use alternative <b>start</b> <b>codons.</b>|$|R

The subcellular localization {{of the different}} forms was investigated directly or by using chimeric genes constructed by fusion of the bFGF and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase open reading frames. The AUG-initiated proteins were cytoplasmic, while the CUG-initiated forms were nuclear. The signal sequence responsible for the nuclear localization of bFGF is contained within 37 amino acid residues between the second CUG and the AUG <b>start</b> <b>codons.</b> Alternative initiation of translation regulates the subcellular localization of bFGF and thus could modulate its role in cell growth and differentiation control...|$|R

2500|$|Human NEDD4L gene {{is located}} on {{chromosome}} 18q12.31 with 38 exons that transcribe multiple splice variants of NEDD4L.

In bacteria, the derivative N-formylmethionine is used as the initial amino acid.|$|E
