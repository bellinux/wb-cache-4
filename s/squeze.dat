We had a place in car, we called [...] "Hell" [...] because you couldn't see the daylight. You went off for a gig, let's says we started at noon, two guys or three guys could sit up front in the car, where you go for other two guys? So, we opened the sliding door at the side and it was all loaded with the equipement and we put mattress in there you can sleep. It was nice at night on the way back, but for the rest of the day going into the gig, you go to sleep, you go into the Hell and it was a pitch dark".
