30|$|The paper {{does not}} {{consider}} direct <b>subsidies</b> (i.e., direct payments made by the government) either to consumers or producers but focuses on implicit consumer <b>subsidies</b> following the definition and approach of the International Energy Agency ([1999]). We adopted a broad definition of energy <b>subsidies</b> as any government policies or measures could directly or indirectly influence prices or costs. These <b>subsidies</b> are estimated as a price-gap between actual prices and market prices, which would prevail {{in the absence of}} <b>subsidies.</b> In this paper, we focus only on consumer <b>subsidies</b> in electricity and gas sectors. Indirect consumer <b>subsidies</b> for the oil and coal sector are not considered since previous studies have shown that prices of oil products are close to market levels and consumer <b>subsidies</b> for coal did not take place in Ukraine (e.g., IEA [2006 a, 2008, 2011 b]).|$|R

This is an interesting case study because direct mean tested monetary transfers have been used in recent years to distribute public transport <b>subsidies</b> rather than use more traditional supply side sectoral <b>subsidies.</b> The results show that using the general welfare system to distribute transport <b>subsidies</b> performs much better than traditional supply side <b>subsidies.</b> The latter are very badly targeted and in some cases quite regressive. Together with some recent evidence from other developing country cities, the results of this paper imply that more effort needs to be placed on the analysis, design and implementation of social <b>subsidies</b> in the transport sector. ...|$|R
5|$|In 2012, Iran's {{head of the}} Expediency Council, Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, {{criticized the}} {{government}} for failing to reinvest the money it saved by restructuring government subsidies. To compensate, the government says it has allowed producers to adjust their prices more liberally and it has given free loans and energy subsidies in some cases. In recent years, income inequality in Iran has declined by different measures, which may be an effect of the <b>subsidy</b> reforms. For example, the income Gini coefficient fell from 0.4023 in 2005 to 0.3813 in 2010.

5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, Paul Krugman used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft {{in the context of the}} model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a <b>subsidy</b> to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the <b>subsidy</b> had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on price elasticity of demand; for relatively inelastic demand the net effect of <b>subsidy</b> is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from the <b>subsidy</b> and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a brief overview}} of the East German employment problem and presents a simple model in which to evaluate two rival policy proposals: wage <b>subsidies</b> and revenue-sharing <b>subsidies.</b> Revenue-sharing <b>subsidies</b> have received little, if any, attention in the ongoing public debate on how to raise East German employment efficiently. This paper suggests that this may be a serious omission. Given the labour market conditions in East Germany today, it is shown that the social and budgetary costs associated with revenue-sharing <b>subsidies</b> may be expected to be lower than those associated with wage <b>subsidies.</b> The intuition underlying this result is that given the structure of wage bargaining in East Germany, wage <b>subsidies</b> may be expected to lead to excessive real wage increases, whereas revenue-sharing <b>subsidies</b> may not. The reason is that revenue- or profit-sharing may be expected to bring the labour market close to full employment even when the associated <b>subsidies</b> are negligibly small, and thus these <b>subsidies</b> can be devoted entirely to the achievement of the government's wage targets. By contrast, negligibly small wage <b>subsidies</b> cannot generate full employment under current East German labour market conditions, and <b>subsidies</b> that are sufficiently large for this purpose may be expected to drive real wages far above the government's wage objectives.

5|$|Just {{as there}} is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for <b>subsidy</b> shifting. Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government <b>subsidy</b> schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.|$|E
5|$|The ACA {{also helps}} reduce income {{inequality}} measured after taxes, due to higher {{taxes on the}} top 5% of income earners and both subsidies and Medicaid expansion for lower-income persons. CBO estimated that subsidies paid under the law in 2016 averaged $4,240 per person for 10 million individuals receiving them, roughly $42 billion. For scale, the <b>subsidy</b> for the employer market, {{in the form of}} exempting from taxation those health insurance premiums paid on behalf of employees by employers, was approximately $1,700 per person in 2016, or $266 billion total in the employer market.

5|$|The {{basic model}} can be {{extended}} to incorporate a supra-game played by {{the governments of the}} respective countries. In this case, each government chooses the level of <b>subsidy</b> it will provide to its firm, taking the other government's action as given, and anticipating the reaction of the firms (in terms of quantity produced) to the <b>subsidy.</b> Brander and Spencer show that in the resulting Nash equilibrium the governments choose a level of <b>subsidy</b> that is too high and hence they do not manage to maximize social welfare. In fact, if the good produced is not consumed domestically, then the optimal level of <b>subsidy</b> is negative – an export tax., where m is a competitively produced numéraire good This is because the total quantity produced in the Cournot and the Stackelberg equilibrium is higher than the profit maximizing collusive monopoly level of output. Since both the home and foreign firm are producing for a third market, an export tax could reduce the total quantity produced down to the monopoly level, thus increasing both firms' profits. In that way the governments can effect a collusive outcome between their firms, at the expanse of the third country which imports the good.|$|E
