5|$|Addition {{of boron}} nitride to <b>silicon</b> nitride {{ceramics}} improves the thermal shock {{resistance of the}} resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added also to <b>silicon</b> nitride-alumina and titanium nitride-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and zirconia, borosilicate glasses, glass ceramics, enamels, and composite ceramics with titanium boride-boron nitride, titanium boride-aluminium nitride-boron nitride, and <b>silicon</b> carbide-boron nitride composition.|$|E
5|$|Germanium {{differs from}} <b>silicon</b> {{in that the}} supply {{is limited by the}} {{availability}} of exploitable sources, while the supply of <b>silicon</b> is limited only by production capacity since <b>silicon</b> comes from ordinary sand and quartz. While <b>silicon</b> could be bought in 1998 for less than $10 per kg, the price of germanium was almost $800 per kg.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolGe and atomic number32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and <b>silicon.</b> Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental <b>silicon.</b> Like <b>silicon,</b> germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, <b>silicon</b> does {{react with}} vacancies, {{creating}} the described above optical absorption at 738nm. The assumed mechanism is trapping of migrating vacancy by substitutional <b>silicon</b> {{resulting in the}} Si-V (semi-divacancy) configuration.|$|E
5|$|Si-vacancies {{constitute}} minor {{fraction of}} total <b>silicon.</b> It is believed (though no proof exists) that much <b>silicon</b> substitutes for carbon thus becoming invisible to most spectroscopic techniques because <b>silicon</b> and carbon atoms {{have the same}} configuration of the outer electronic shells.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silicon</b> carbide (SiC), {{also known}} as {{carborundum}} , is a semiconductor containing <b>silicon</b> and carbon with chemical formula SiC. It occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite. Synthetic <b>silicon</b> carbide powder has been mass-produced since 1893 for use as an abrasive. Grains of <b>silicon</b> carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, such as car brakes, car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Electronic applications of <b>silicon</b> carbide such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and detectors in early radios were first demonstrated around 1907. SiC is used in semiconductor electronics devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages, or both. Large single crystals of <b>silicon</b> carbide can be grown by the Lely method; they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite. <b>Silicon</b> carbide with high surface area can be produced from SiO2 contained in plant material.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silicon</b> is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in diamond films grown by chemical vapor deposition and it originates either from <b>silicon</b> substrate or from silica windows or walls of the CVD reactor. It was also observed in natural diamonds in dispersed form. Isolated <b>silicon</b> defects have been detected in diamond lattice through the sharp optical absorption peak at 738nm and electron paramagnetic resonance. Similar to other large impurities, the major form of <b>silicon</b> in diamond has been identified with a Si-vacancy complex (semi-divacancy site). This center is a deep donor having an ionization energy of 2 eV, and thus again is unsuitable for electronic applications.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silicon</b> nitride {{bearings}} {{are both}} full ceramic bearings and ceramic hybrid bearings with balls in ceramics and races in steel. <b>Silicon</b> nitride ceramics have good shock resistance {{compared to other}} ceramics. Therefore, ball bearings made of <b>silicon</b> nitride ceramic are used in performance bearings. A representative example is use of <b>silicon</b> nitride bearings in the main engines of the NASA's Space Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silicon</b> nitride is {{also used}} in xerographic process {{as one of the}} layer of the photo drum. <b>Silicon</b> nitride {{is also used}} as an {{ignition}} source for domestic gas appliances. Because of its good elastic properties, <b>silicon</b> nitride, along with <b>silicon</b> and <b>silicon</b> oxide, is the most popular material for cantilevers — the sensing elements of atomic force microscopes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silicon</b> nitride {{remained}} {{merely a}} chemical curiosity for decades {{before it was}} used in commercial applications. From 1948 to 1952, the Carborundum Company, Niagara Falls, New York, applied for several patents on the manufacture and application of <b>silicon</b> nitride. By 1958 Haynes (Union Carbide) <b>silicon</b> nitride was in commercial production for thermocouple tubes, rocket nozzles, and boats and crucibles for melting metals. British work on <b>silicon</b> nitride, started in 1953, was aimed at high-temperature parts of gas turbines and resulted {{in the development of}} reaction-bonded <b>silicon</b> nitride and hot-pressed <b>silicon</b> nitride. In 1971, the Advanced Research Project Agency of the US Department of Defense placed a US$17million contract with Ford and Westinghouse for two ceramic gas turbines.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silicon</b> tombac: {{high-strength}} alloy made of copper, zinc and <b>silicon.</b> Often used as {{an alternative}} for investment casted steel parts.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of <b>silicon</b> is generally nonmetallic (covalent) in nature. It {{is not known}} to form a cation. <b>Silicon</b> can form alloys with metals such as iron and copper. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. The high strength of the silicon-oxygen bond dominates the chemical behaviour of <b>silicon.</b> Polymeric silicates, built up by tetrahedral SiO4 units sharing their oxygen atoms, are the most abundant and important compounds of <b>silicon.</b> The polymeric borates, comprising linked trigonal and tetrahedral BO3 or BO4 units, are built on similar structural principles. The oxide SiO2 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Traditional organometallic chemistry includes the carbon compounds of <b>silicon</b> (see organosilicon).|$|E

5|$|Before Soul Reavers release, the {{relationship}} between <b>Silicon</b> Knights and Crystal Dynamics dissolved. Because their research was used, <b>Silicon</b> Knights filed an injunction to stop further promotion of the game. Other delays pushed the release date from October 1998 to August 1999.|$|E
5|$|Boron, <b>silicon,</b> germanium, arsenic, antimony, and {{tellurium}} are recognised commonly as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, polonium, or astatine are sometimes added to the list. Boron sometimes is excluded, by itself, or with <b>silicon.</b> Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and astatine as metalloids also has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Compounds of boron, <b>silicon,</b> arsenic and {{antimony}} {{have been}} used as flame retardants. Boron, in the form of borax, {{has been used as a}} textile flame retardant since at least the 18th century. <b>Silicon</b> compounds such as silicones, silanes, silsesquioxane, silica and silicates, some of which were developed as alternatives to more toxic halogenated products, can considerably improve the flame retardancy of plastic materials.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 an {{exceptionally}} strong composite of aluminium oxide and <b>silicon</b> carbide whiskers was discovered. Development of this laboratory-produced composite {{to a commercial}} product took only three years. In 1985, the first commercial cutting tools made from this alumina and <b>silicon</b> carbide whisker-reinforced composite {{were introduced to the}} market.|$|E
5|$|In the arts, <b>silicon</b> carbide is {{a popular}} {{abrasive}} in modern lapidary due to the durability and low cost of the material. In manufacturing, it is used for its hardness in abrasive machining processes such as grinding, honing, water-jet cutting and sandblasting. Particles of <b>silicon</b> carbide are laminated to paper to create sandpapers and the grip tape on skateboards.|$|E
5|$|Like other hard {{ceramics}} (namely alumina and boron carbide), <b>silicon</b> carbide {{is used in}} composite armor (e.g. Chobham armor), and in ceramic {{plates in}} bulletproof vests. Dragon Skin, which was produced by Pinnacle Armor, used disks of <b>silicon</b> carbide.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of sintered <b>silicon</b> nitride is in automobile industry as a material for engine parts. Those include, in diesel engines, glowplugs for faster start-up; precombustion chambers (swirl chambers) for lower emissions, faster start-up and lower noise; turbocharger for reduced engine lag and emissions. In spark-ignition engines, <b>silicon</b> nitride is used for rocker arm pads for lower wear, turbocharger for lower inertia and less engine lag, and in exhaust gas control valves for increased acceleration. As examples of production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered <b>silicon</b> nitride turbochargers made annually.|$|E
5|$|Packaging: SiC chips {{may have}} a higher power density than <b>silicon</b> power devices {{and are able to}} handle higher {{temperatures}} exceeding the <b>silicon</b> limit of 150°C. New die attach technologies such as sintering are required to efficiently get the heat out of the devices and ensure a reliable interconnection.|$|E
5|$|References to <b>silicon</b> carbide heating {{elements}} exist {{from the early}} 20th century when they were produced by Acheson's Carborundum Co. in the U.S. and EKL in Berlin. <b>Silicon</b> carbide offered increased operating temperatures compared with metallic heaters. <b>Silicon</b> carbide elements are used today in the melting of glass and non-ferrous metal, heat treatment of metals, float glass production, production of ceramics and electronics components, igniters in pilot lights for gas heaters, etc.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silicon</b> carbide is an {{important}} material in TRISO-coated fuel particles, the type of nuclear fuel found in high temperature gas cooled reactors such as the Pebble Bed Reactor. A layer of <b>silicon</b> carbide gives coated fuel particles structural support and is the main diffusion barrier {{to the release of}} fission products.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silicon</b> carbide, {{dissolved}} in a {{basic oxygen furnace}} used for making steel, acts as a fuel. The additional energy liberated allows the furnace to process more scrap with the same charge of hot metal. It {{can also be used}} to raise tap temperatures and adjust the carbon and <b>silicon</b> content. <b>Silicon</b> carbide is cheaper than a combination of ferrosilicon and carbon, produces cleaner steel and lower emissions due to low levels of trace elements, has a low gas content, and does not lower the temperature of steel.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silicon</b> {{is present}} in silatrane, a highly toxic rodenticide. Long-term {{inhalation}} of silica dust causes silicosis, a fatal disease of the lungs. <b>Silicon</b> is an essential trace element. Silicone gel {{can be applied to}} badly burned patients to reduce scarring.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silicon</b> nitride {{has many}} {{orthopedic}} applications. The material {{is also an}} alternative to PEEK (polyether ether ketone) and titanium, which are used for spinal fusion devices. It is <b>silicon</b> nitride’s hydrophilic, microtextured surface {{that contributes to the}} material's strength, durability and reliability compared to PEEK and titanium.|$|E
5|$|Silicon-germanium alloys {{are rapidly}} {{becoming}} an important semiconductor material for high-speed integrated circuits. Circuits utilizing {{the properties of}} Si-SiGe junctions can be much faster than those using <b>silicon</b> alone. Silicon-germanium is beginning to replace gallium arsenide (GaAs) in wireless communications devices. The SiGe chips, with high-speed properties, {{can be made with}} low-cost, well-established production techniques of the <b>silicon</b> chip industry.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>silicon</b> nitride ball {{bearings}} are harder than metal, this reduces {{contact with the}} bearing track. This results in 80% less friction, 3 to 10 times longer lifetime, 80% higher speed, 60% less weight, the ability to operate with lubrication starvation, higher corrosion resistance and higher operation temperature, as compared to traditional metal bearings. <b>Silicon</b> nitride balls weigh 79% less than tungsten carbide balls. <b>Silicon</b> nitride {{ball bearings}} {{can be found in}} high end automotive bearings, industrial bearings, wind turbines, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and skateboards. <b>Silicon</b> nitride bearings are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals. For example, in tidal flow meters, where seawater attack is a problem, or in electric field seekers.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the germanium transistor in 1948 {{opened the door to}} countless applications of solid state electronics. From 1950 through the early 1970s, this area provided an increasing market for germanium, but then high-purity <b>silicon</b> began replacing germanium in transistors, diodes, and rectifiers. For example, the company that became Fairchild Semiconductor was founded in 1957 with the express purpose of producing <b>silicon</b> transistors. <b>Silicon</b> has superior electrical properties, but it requires much greater purity that could not be commercially achieved {{in the early years of}} semiconductor electronics.|$|E
5|$|The lattice {{constants}} of <b>silicon</b> nitride and <b>silicon</b> are different. Therefore, tension or stress can occur, {{depending on the}} deposition process. Especially when using PECVD technology this tension can be reduced by adjusting deposition parameters.|$|E
5|$|The temple takes {{advantage}} of Singapore's abundant sunlight by having three different kinds of solar energy cells on its rooftop. They are the poly-crystalline <b>silicon</b> solar array, mono-crystalline <b>silicon</b> solar array and amorphous <b>silicon</b> solar array. Poh Ern Shih's water is heated by its solar panels, and its night lighting is powered by electricity converted from solar energy, With its breezy location, wind generators have also been erected to convert wind activity into electricity.|$|E
5|$|Then {{calcium oxide}} {{combines}} with <b>silicon</b> dioxide {{to form a}} liquid slag.|$|E
5|$|While rare on Earth, <b>silicon</b> carbide {{is remarkably}} common in space. It {{is a common}} form of {{stardust}} found around carbon-rich stars, and examples of this stardust {{have been found in}} pristine condition in primitive (unaltered) meteorites. The <b>silicon</b> carbide found in space and in meteorites is almost exclusively the beta-polymorph. Analysis of SiC grains found in the Murchison meteorite, a carbonaceous chondrite meteorite, has revealed anomalous isotopic ratios of carbon and <b>silicon,</b> indicating an origin from outside the solar system; 99% of these SiC grains originate around carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars. SiC is commonly found around these stars as deduced from their infrared spectra.|$|E
25|$|<b>Silicon</b> {{thin-film}} {{cells are}} mainly deposited by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (typically plasma-enhanced, PE-CVD) from silane gas and hydrogen gas. Depending on the deposition parameters, this can yield amorphous <b>silicon</b> (a-Si or a-Si:H), protocrystalline <b>silicon</b> or nanocrystalline <b>silicon</b> (nc-Si or nc-Si:H), also called microcrystalline <b>silicon.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since <b>silicon</b> is {{the most}} common {{semiconductor}} used in solid-state electronics, and <b>silicon</b> has a valence of four, the tetrahedral shape of the four chemical bonds in <b>silicon</b> is a strong influence on how crystals of <b>silicon</b> form and what shapes they assume.|$|E
25|$|Amorphous <b>silicon</b> is {{the most}} {{well-developed}} thin film technology to-date. An amorphous <b>silicon</b> (a-Si) solar cell is made of non-crystalline or microcrystalline <b>silicon.</b> Amorphous <b>silicon</b> has a higher bandgap (1.7eV) than crystalline <b>silicon</b> (c-Si) (1.1eV), which means it absorbs the visible part of the solar spectrum more strongly than the higher power density infrared portion of the spectrum. The production of a-Si thin film solar cells uses glass as a substrate and deposits a very thin layer of <b>silicon</b> by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).|$|E
