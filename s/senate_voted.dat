5|$|Harding's {{appointment}} of Harry M. Daugherty as Attorney General received more criticism than any other. Daugherty's Ohio lobbying and back room maneuvers {{were not considered}} to qualify him for his office. When the scandals broke in 1923 and 1924, Daugherty's many enemies were delighted {{at the prospect of}} connecting him with the dishonesty, and assumed he had taken part in Teapot Dome, though Fall and Daugherty were not friends. In February 1924, the <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> to investigate the Justice Department, where Daugherty remained Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1824, the <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> {{to repeal}} the law that had {{established}} the Court of Appeals and {{to establish a new}} Court of Appeals with four justices. The measure came to the House floor on December 23. During the debate, Governor Desha personally lobbied legislators to support the measure, a blatant violation of the rules of the House. The next day the measure passed in the House by a vote of 5443. Governor Desha appointed pro-relief stalwart William T.

Rumors relating to Black's involvement in the Ku Klux Klan surfaced among the senators, and two Democratic senators tried defeating the nomination. However, no conclusive evidence of Black's involvement was available at the time, so after six hours of debate, the <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> 63–16 to confirm Black. Ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against Black. Alabama Governor Bibb Graves appointed his own wife, Dixie B. Graves, to fill Black's vacated seat.|$|E
5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required {{the support of a}} two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail, due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E
5|$|In March 1978, Smith {{reached an}} accord with three African leaders, led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, who offered {{to leave the}} white {{population}} comfortably entrenched {{in exchange for the}} establishment of a biracial democracy. As a result of the Internal Settlement, elections were held in April 1979, concluding with the United African National Council (UANC) carrying a majority of parliamentary seats. On 1 June 1979, Muzorewa, the UANC head, became prime minister and the country's name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The Internal Settlement left control of the Rhodesian Security Forces, civil service, judiciary, and a third of parliament seats to whites. On 12 June, the United States <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> to lift economic pressure on the former Rhodesia.|$|E

In 2012, the National Journal gave McCain a composite score of 73% conservative and 27% liberal. In 2013, the National Journal gave him a composite score of 60% conservative and 40% liberal.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{historian}} Josiah Bunting III {{noted that}} Grant was never {{put on his}} guard when Secretary Belknap came to the White House in a disturbed manner or even asked why Belknap wanted to resign in the first place. Bunting argues that Grant should have pressed Belknap into {{an explanation for the}} abrupt resignation request. Grant's acceptance of the resignation indirectly allowed Belknap, after he was impeached by the House of Representatives for his actions, to escape conviction, since he was no longer a government official. Belknap was acquitted by the Senate, escaping with less than the two-thirds majority vote needed for conviction. Even though the <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> that it could put private citizens on trial, many senators were reluctant to convict Belknap since he was no longer Secretary of War. It has been suggested that Grant accepted the resignation in a Victorian impulse to protect the women involved.|$|E

In April 2011 the Columbia University <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> to welcome the ROTC program back on campus. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and Columbia University President Lee C.

5|$|Later, Owsley's tenure {{would be}} marred by a {{conflict}} with Benjamin Hardin, his Secretary of State. Hardin believed that by supporting Owsley in the gubernatorial election, he would obtain some influence in Owsley's choices for other appointments. Tensions between Hardin and Owsley worsened as Hardin became increasingly frustrated with his lack of influence. On September 1, 1846, Owsley removed Hardin from his cabinet, charging that Hardin had abandoned his duties {{because he did not}} reside in Frankfort. Hardin challenged this premise for his removal, and when Owsley nominated George B. Kinkead to replace Hardin, the state <b>senate</b> <b>voted</b> 30—8 that no vacancy existed. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld this decision. Vindicated, Hardin then resigned, charging Owsley with practicing nepotism. In the Kentucky Constitution of 1850, the governor was stripped of his power to remove the Secretary of State from office.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{proposed}} to open negotiations with Spain {{on the basis}} of Cuban liberation and Puerto Rican annexation, with the final status of the Philippines subject to further discussion. He stood firmly in that demand even as the military situation on Cuba began to deteriorate when the American army was struck with yellow fever. Spain ultimately agreed to a ceasefire on those terms on August 12, and treaty negotiations began in Paris in September 1898. The talks continued until December 18, when the Treaty of Paris was signed. The United States acquired Puerto Rico and the Philippines as well as the island of Guam, and Spain relinquished its claims to Cuba; in exchange, the United States agreed to pay Spain $20 million. McKinley had difficulty convincing the Senate to approve the treaty by the requisite two-thirds vote, but his lobbying, and that of Vice President Hobart, eventually saw success, as the <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> in favor on February 6, 1899, 57 to 27.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{gained the}} time and the {{opportunity}} to start hostilities with the Filipinos at the place and time of their choice. On the night of 4 February 1899, when most of the Filipino generals were at a ball in Malolos to celebrate the success of the American anti-imperialists delaying the ratification of the Treaty of Paris, the Americans staged an incident along the concrete blockhouses in Santa Mesa near the Balsahan Bridge. An American patrol fired on Filipino troops, claiming afterwards that the Filipinos had started shooting first. The whole Filipino line from Pasay to Caloocan returned fire and the first battle of the Filipino-American War ensued. Two days later, in response to the incident, the US <b>Senate</b> <b>voted</b> for annexation. In doing so, the conflict became the war of conquest, occupation and annexation that Luna, Mabini, and others had predicted and about which they had warned Aguinaldo and his generals previously.|$|E
