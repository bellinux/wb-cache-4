5|$|The {{main event}} {{began with a}} <b>stare</b> <b>down.</b> Luger gained the early {{advantage}} and managed to knock Yokozuna down by kicking the ring ropes into Yokozuna's groin. Luger tried to bodyslam Yokozuna, but the sumo wrestler's weight was too much. Yokozuna knocked {{him out of the}} ring and choked him. Yokozuna had his manager, Mr. Fuji, throw him a salt bucket, which he used to attack Luger. Yokozuna wore Luger down, and after a brief comeback by the all-American, hit a leg drop on Luger and pulled him to the corner for a Banzai Drop. After Yokozuna missed, Luger succeeded in bodyslamming Yokozuna, and he attacked Mr. Fuji when the manager tried to get involved. Luger knocked Yokozuna out of the ring with a forearm smash, and followed this up by attacking Jim Cornette. Yokozuna was counted out, but he retained the title because championships change hands only by pinfall or submission. Several faces came to the ring to celebrate with Luger as red, white and blue balloons fell from the ceiling to celebrate the victory.|$|E
25|$|Unlike many boxers, Norton {{would often}} {{not attempt to}} <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> an {{opponent}} while announcements were made before the match started. Instead, he'd often {{look down at the}} floor and gather his thoughts. He was also widely noted for his fine athletic build.|$|E
25|$|On the August 2 {{edition of}} NXT, Itami cut an in-ring promo, {{demanding}} respect from the fans. He {{was interrupted by}} Aleister Black, who was scheduled to face Kyle O'Reilly in the night's main event. After a <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> between the two, Black hit Itami with Black Mass. Itami attempted to assault Black following the event, but the two were separated by fellow talent. At , Itami was defeated by Black.|$|E

25|$|At Elimination Chamber {{during the}} WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match, as Baron Corbin had a <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> with The Miz, Intercontinental Champion Dean Ambrose {{eliminated}} Corbin with a rollup pin. An enraged Corbin attacked Ambrose and executed the End of Days on {{him before he}} left the chamber, which allowed Miz to eliminate Ambrose. On the following SmackDown, Ambrose wanted to exact revenge on Corbin, however, he was attacked by Corbin just as Ambrose made his entrance for his match against James Ellsworth. Ambrose and Corbin then participated in the WWE Championship number one contender's battle royal, where Ambrose eliminated Corbin. Corbin again attacked Ambrose with the End of Days and Ambrose was eventually eliminated from the match. Ambrose called out Corbin {{over the next couple of}} weeks. Corbin attacked Ambrose backstage and proclaimed his desire to take the Intercontinental Championship from Ambrose. On the March 14 episode, Corbin formally challenged Ambrose for the title at WrestleMania 33. The following week during Corbin's match against Randy Orton, Ambrose caused a distraction and cost Corbin his match, before accepting Corbin's challenge and executed Dirty Deeds on him. The match was moved to the Kickoff pre-show.|$|E
500|$|Late in the decade, {{there was}} a brief {{exploration}} into the idea of launching a Mutual television network, serious enough to prompt talks with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a potential source of programming talent. In fact, Bamberger Broadcasting's WOR-TV & WOIC (the latter a Washington, D.C. video outlet) maintained letterhead with [...] "Mutual Television" [...] decorating their identifications. Beyond this, there is no confirmation, however, that a cooperative video service was ever seriously considered. The plans never got off the ground and Mutual thus became {{the only one of the}} [...] "Big Four" [...] U.S. radio networks not to start (and eventually be dominated by) a television network. While there was no Mutual TV network, this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television's early development. Several Mutual radio affiliates launched their own television stations that would often be affiliated with the television networks of ABC, [...] NBC, CBS or DuMont. The cooperative also held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the tabloid talk show and [...] "reality" [...] programming: the crabby gabfest Leave It to the Girls and, in particular, Queen for a Day, which both started on Mutual radio in 1945. Referred to by some as a [...] "misery show," [...] Queen for a Day [...] "awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart-stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden.... On one show, a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled himâ€”and who, by the way, also needed heart surgery." [...] In May 1947, a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system's experimental TV station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (later KTSL). It was a smash hit, and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings. In the 1950s, Mutual would <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show.|$|E
2500|$|She {{also was}} [...] "one {{of the most}} {{effective}} chroniclers" [...] of the violence that erupted at the independence and partition of India and Pakistan, according to Somini Sengupta, who calls her photographs of the episode [...] "gut-wrenching, and staring at them, you glimpse the photographer's undaunted desire to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> horror." [...] She recorded streets littered with corpses, dead victims with open eyes, and refugees with vacant eyes. [...] "Bourke-White's photographs seem to scream on the page," [...] Sengupta wrote. The photographs were taken just two years after those Bourke-White took of the newly captured Buchenwald.|$|E

2500|$|At the Royal Rumble, The Undertaker {{competed in}} the Royal Rumble match, but Roman Reigns entered the match at number thirty and {{eliminated}} Undertaker. In the ensuing <b>stare</b> <b>down,</b> Reigns exclaimed: [...] "This is my yard now!", a claim Undertaker had made for many years. On the March 6 episode of Raw, Braun Strowman, who had lost to Reigns at Fastlane, called out Reigns, but instead, The Undertaker appeared and stared down Strowman until Strowman left the ring. Reigns then came out and reiterated that WWE was his yard now. After a <b>stare</b> <b>down,</b> The Undertaker attacked Reigns with a chokeslam. A match between the two at WrestleMania 33 was confirmed the following week. Later on Raw, The Undertaker's gong sounded during Reigns' match against Jinder Mahal; Reigns was distracted, but nevertheless defeated Mahal. When Reigns called out The Undertaker after the match, Shawn Michaels came out instead to give Reigns advice about The Undertaker. Reigns said that he appreciated the advice, but {{said that he would}} retire The Undertaker just as Undertaker had retired Michaels at WrestleMania XXVI. The following week, during Reigns' rematch with Strowman, The Undertaker attacked Strowman with a chokeslam, but was surprised by Reigns with a spear. When Reigns had left, Undertaker sat up and taunted Reigns with his throat slash gesture. On the final Raw before WrestleMania, The Undertaker stated that the graveyard would be Reigns' yard after WrestleMania.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} abounds with classical references. At {{the entryway}} are bronze busts of Zeus and Apollo. The foyer contains a white marble bust of Pallas Athena, {{modeled after the}} Minerve du Collier at the Louvre and donated by Jonathan Ackerman Coles of the Columbia College Class of 1864, an alumnus of Columbia's Philolexian Society. She is surrounded there by the twelve signs of the zodiac. The [...] rotunda, formerly the library reading room when the building was used for its original function, is lined with columns of solid green Connemara marble from Ireland, topped with gold capitals. Roman and Greek philosophers Demosthenes, Euripides, Sophocles, and Augustus Caesar <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> from the rotunda's heights as the four points of knowledge, Law, Philosophy, Medicine, and Theology mark the four points of the Greek Cross. The rest of the interior is finished with Italian and Istrian marble.|$|E
2500|$|On {{that same}} Raw Is War at the First Union Center in Philadelphia, The Rock {{returned}} {{for the first}} time since his kayfabe suspension (in reality, he was given the [...] "suspension" [...] to film The Scorpion King) on the April 2 episode of Raw Is War. Shane, Stephanie, and Vince McMahon were in the ring that night, trying to convince The Rock to join them. Shane reminded The Rock of how Vince screwed him out of the WWF Championship earlier that year at WrestleMania and also in a steel cage match the day after WrestleMania. Vince conceded that it was wrong for him to back Austin, as he was a rattlesnake that he should have known would eventually bite him. He promised The Rock that he had no intention of screwing him if he returned to the WWF but also noted that he could not promise that he never would; if it was good for business, he said, then he just might do it. He told The Rock that he was at least being honest with him and pleaded for The Rock to trust himself, stating that his future was with the fans and the WWF. The Rock gave Vince a Rock Bottom after some bickering between Shane and Vince, and proceeded to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> Shane, then smile cheekily and shake Shane's hand, faking a defection to the Alliance and a heel turn â€“ but he then proceeded to Rock Bottom him as well and give him a People's Elbow, before emphatically asserting, [...] "Finally, the Rock has come back... to the WWF," [...] thus aligning himself with the World Wrestling Federation.|$|E

60|$|Sometimes he poised {{himself in}} the air, {{listening}} intently with {{his hand to his}} ear, and again he would <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he went on again.|$|E
60|$|Hereward tried, for one moment, to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> Herluin. But those terrible eye-glances, before which Vikings had quailed, {{turned off}} {{harmless}} {{from the more}} terrible glance {{of the man who}} believed himself backed by the Maker of the universe, and all the hierarchy of heaven.|$|E

60|$|He {{pulled at}} his choking collar, {{looked at his}} watch, opened the window to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> at the street, looked at his watch, tried to read the evening paper lying on the glass-topped bureau, looked again at his watch. Three minutes had gone by since he had first looked at it.|$|E
60|$|Peter {{shook his}} head in a puzzled way and {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> the long empty hall. Of course he was talking about Johnny and Polly Chuck, who had gone to sleep for the winter. That sleeping business always puzzles Peter. It seems to him like a terrible waste of time. But Chatterer had too much on his mind to waste time wondering how other people could sleep all winter. He couldn't himself, and now that he had been driven away from his own home in the Green Forest by fear of Shadow the Weasel, he couldn't waste a minute. He must find a new home and then spend every minute of daytime laying up a new store of food for the days when everything would be covered with snow.|$|E

6000|$|Two invasions at {{the same}} moment of time; and these no mere Viking raids for plunder, but {{deliberate}} attempts at conquest and colonization, by the two most famous captains of the age. What if both succeeded? What if the two storm-clouds swept across England, each on its own path, and met in the midst, to hurl their lightnings into each other? A fight between William of Normandy and Harold of Norway, on some moorland in Mercia,--it would be a battle of giants; a sight at which Odin and the Gods of Valhalla would rise from their seats, and throw away the mead-horn, to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> on the deeds of heroes scarcely less mighty than themselves. Would that neither might win! Would that they would destroy and devour, till there was none left of Frenchmen or of Norwegians! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am the Deputy Commissioner,' {{said the}} gentleman in English. Now he overvalued {{the effects of}} {{university}} degrees, and stared Khoda Dad Khan in the face. But if from your earliest infancy you have been accustomed to look on battle, murder, and sudden death, if spilt blood affects your nerves as much as red paint, and, above all, if you have faithfully believed that the Bengali was the servant of all Hindustan, and that all Hindustan was vastly inferior to your own large, lustful self, you can endure, even though uneducated, a very large amount of looking over. You can even <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> a graduate of an Oxford college if the latter has been born in a hothouse, of stock bred in a hothouse, and fearing physical pain as some men fear sin; especially if your opponent's mother has frightened him to sleep in his youth with horrible stories of devils inhabiting Afghanistan, and dismal legends of the black North. The eyes behind the gold spectacles sought the floor. Khoda Dad Khan chuckled, and swung out to find Tallantire hard by. 'Here,' said he roughly, thrusting the coins before him, 'touch and remit. That answers for MY good behaviour. But, O Sahib, has the Government gone mad to send a black Bengali dog to us? And am I to pay service to such an one? And are you to work under him? What does it mean?' 'It is an order,' said Tallantire. He had expected something of this kind. 'He is a very clever S-sahib.' ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the station}} of Aberystwyth {{there were about}} three or four {{thousand}} Welshmen of the national height, volubly waiting for the trains to bear them away to their farms and villages; but they made way most amiably for the dismounting travellers, who in our case were led through them by the most energetic porter I ever knew. They did not <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> upon us from the unseemly altitude of other national statures, and often during our stay I saw like crowds of civil men in the street markets who were no taller, and sometimes there were women who had not scaled the heights reached by our American girls. They would probably have competed fairly well with these in the courses of the colleges to which the Welsh send their daughters as well as their sons; but I will not pretend that the good looks of either the men or women was of the American average. I cannot even say that these contemporary ancient Britons had the advantage of the toothless English peasantry in the prompt dentistry which is our peculiar blessing. In Great Britain, though I must not say Ireland, for I have never been there, a few staggering incisors seem a formidable equipment of the jaw in lower-class middle life and even tender youth. The difference is a tremendous advantage which, if it does not make for the highest character in us, will doubtless stand us in good stead in any close with the well-toothed Japanese, and when we are beaten, our gold-fillings will go far to pay our indemnity.|$|E
