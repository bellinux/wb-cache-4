Based on meat color, results indicated that pork loin packaged in ceramic sheet and control treatment showed that the samples of the control treatment tended to darken gradually {{in comparison with the}} samples at 0 day, but FIR treatment had few changes. Among the total plate counts of sliced loin in PE and loin in vacuum package under different storage times at 4 and 0 degreesC, results showed that FIR ceramic <b>sheet</b> <b>package</b> treatment had lower total plate counts and significant differences (p< 0. 05). In VBN value, both treatments tended to rise high with the increasing of storage time, but the FIR treatment was significantly lower (p< 0. 05) than the control treatment. Its results had a corresponding relationship with the total plate counts. Regarding the drip loss of sliced loin in PE and loin in vacuum package, it showed that FIR ceramic <b>sheet</b> <b>package</b> treatment had lower drip loss and significant differences (p< 0. 01).

40|$|The quick {{manufacturing}} {{of large}} metal forming tools, e. g. for car body parts, {{is a novel}} and promising application of the Metal-LOM technique. The acronym stands for "Metal Laminated Object Manufacturing", i. e. the metal variant of the established prototyping technique, which classically uses paper as build-up material. In the solution presented in horizontal or vertical layers by a specially developed software. Subsequently, steel sheets with a typical thickness of around 1 mm are cut according to these slices, stacked, and joined to a package. The steel slice are manufactured by high-speed laser cutting, and the joining technique can be laser welding, diffusion welding or other, mechnical/thermal combination techniques. In a laser integrated 5 -axes CNC milling center, the active tool parts are clad with wear-resistant coatings by laser or plasma transferred arc cladding. Laser assisted plasma spraying is available for the tool's surface treatment as well. Also, smaller parts of the tools of complex shape can be produced by laser build-up welding directly onto the <b>sheet</b> <b>package.</b> In the end, the final contour of the tool is produced by CNC milling. The aims of the running research project are the reduction of tooling time from 16 to one week, tool dimensions in the meter-range and an application adapted tool life...|$|E

40|$|In conclusion, {{the heat}} {{insulation}} by radiation <b>sheet</b> <b>packages</b> or laminated foams {{is a complex}} problem, which only can be understood {{with the help of}} analytical simulations: On the one hand, the heat insulation is determined by the thermal conductivity. On the other hand, the reflectivity of the surfaces plays an important role.

In principle, the benefit of the usage of open celled foams as heat insulation is twofold: Firstly, to the mass of the heat shields is reduced considerably and thus the production costs are expected to decrease. Secondly, it is expected, that better heat insulation capability may result in lower energy consumption of the furnaces. In conclusion, the project shows that open celled foams out of molybdenum are a potent substitute for conventional radiation sheet heat insulation. Since the masses of the Mo-foams is distinctly lower than that one of the radiation sheets, it is expected, that the use of foams as heat insulation will noticeably reduce production costs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The real {{values of}} plastic {{properties}} of steel sheets are basic input parameters for objectification of deep drawing technological processes. The loss of stability of plastic properties is {{the criterion of}} evaluation of plastic properties of steel sheets in most cases. The loss of stability of plastic properties depends on stress-strain scheme in real conditions of deep drawing of sheets. In the contribution will be evaluated the loss of plastic properties stability of thin double reduced <b>packaging</b> <b>sheets</b> made from low carbon steels. For evaluation of strength and plastic properties of thin <b>packaging</b> <b>sheets</b> is the tensile test most used at present. The material is stressed by uniaxial tension during this test. In the conditions of technological processes of drawing, which thin <b>packaging</b> <b>sheets</b> are mostly treating, is this way of stress not very objective. In most cases it deals about multiaxial stress of sheet by deformation of sheet to require draw cup. At the present, the biggest problem of thin steel sheets by uniaxial tension test evaluation {{is the loss of}} plastic deformation stability (localization of plastic deformation). Therefore, obtained results of plastic deformation during this test do not correspond with real plastic properties of thin steel sheets. In the contribution, will be compared the evaluation of plastic properties of these sheets by uniaxial and biaxial load.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} thin rubber sheets or laminates of metal and rubber sheets as bearings in precision positioning systems. Such bearings {{have the potential to}} replace more conventional flexures fabricated for instance from metal. Rubber bearings also potentially have advantages in for example ease and low-cost of fabrication, overload robustness, and compact form. To study the properties of these we have designed a test fixture. This fixture allows us to measure the shear and compression characteristics of these bearings in their static sense, as a function of frequency, and of various design parameters. The test fixture has been used to test several types of rubber material. The tests performed include compression and shear tests of rubber laminates' static stiffness, dynamic stiffness, preload effects, step response, hysteresis, fatigue tests, and manufactureability. Different low-cost manufacturing methods of the rubber bearings have been suggested and preliminary tests have been done. The feasibility of these manufacturing methods has been confirmed, and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each identified. On the basis of the experimental results a rotary precision positioning system utilizing a rotary laminated rubber bearing, was designed, fabricated and tested. (cont.) The bearing of this device consists of multiple laminates of metal and rubber <b>sheets</b> <b>packaged</b> within a preload mechanism. This preload mechanism assures the bearing radial stiffness and compact form. It also assures a low cost alternative versus the use of conventional flexural bearings.

The conventional method of designing and making thermoforming moulds is laborious and time consuming. A method based on a reverse engineering approach and thermoforming feature concept is proposed.

A CAD model that corresponds to the thermoforming mould of the product is then constructed by using the digitised data. The construction of the mould surface is based on the concept of a defined set of thermoforming mould features. A modified Laplacian smoothing technique is applied to process the digitised data for generating the thermoforming mould surfaces. Several examples are used to explain the working principle and demonstrate the viability of the proposed method. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study for {{analysing}} costs affected by packaging in a producing industry. The purpose {{is to develop a}} model that will calculate and present possible cost savings for the customer by using Volvo Logistics Corporations, VLC’s, returnable packaging instead of other packaging solutions. The thesis is based on qualitative data gained from both theoretical and empirical studies. The methodology for gaining information has been to study theoretical sources such as course literature and articles, as well as through interviews and consolidation with staff at Volvo Logistics Corporations office in Gothenburg. The model is constructed in Microsoft Excel and consists of six different sheets. The first sheet is a front page that summarises the costs calculated in the other sheets and presents the possible cost savings. After the front page there are three sheets with calculations for the costs in different scenarios, Today’s Situation, VLC Packaging Solution (Pre implementation) and VLC Packaging Solution (Post implementation). The first sheet, Today’s Situation, presents the result of the model that will calculate the customers’ current costs that are associated with packaging. The different costs presented in the model are costs for unloading, repacking, today’s cost for an internal packaging solution, quality related costs, one-way packaging costs and the costs for other packaging solutions. The next <b>sheet,</b> VLC <b>Packaging</b> Solution (Pre), presents an estimation of the cost for thecustomer when using VLC’s returnable packaging system. The estimation will serve as an investment tool, for calculating possible cost savings compared to the present situation. The different costs that will be discussed are handling costs, quality related costs, distribution cost, transaction cost, and investment cost. The third and final calculation <b>sheet,</b> VLC <b>Packaging</b> Solution (Post), presents the actual costs for the customer after the implementation. When the costs have been calculated they will be used to evaluate the actual cost savings for the customer. The last two sheets are a data sheet, which consists of data needed for the calculations in the previous sheets, and an instruction sheet where there are instructions to the different calculations in the model. The conclusion shows that the objective to create a model for calculating the costs for different packaging systems and present possible cost savings is fulfilled...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During the thermo-mechanical {{processing}} of aluminium sheet products in commercial production lines the material experiences a complex history of temperature, time and strain paths, which result in alternating cycles of deformation and recrystallization {{with the associated}} changes in microstructure and, especially, crystallographic texture. Thus, computer-based alloy and process development requires integration of models for simulating the evolution of microstructure, microchemistry and crystallographic texture into process models of the thermo-mechanical production of Al sheet. In the present paper the influence of texture on the anisotropic properties is explored for various industrially processed aluminium alloy <b>sheets</b> for <b>packaging</b> applications. Besides the use of experimentally measured sheet textures as an input for the anisotropy calculations, particular attention {{is given to the}} use of modelled textures. Here, results from a comprehensive through-process modelling of the texture evolution during the thermo-mechanical production of aluminium sheet are utilized. Eventually, this will enable us to predict the evolution of texture and the resulting properties along the entire process chain and hence to improve product quality of aluminium sheet products avoiding laborious and expensive plant trials...|$|R

Findings: The positive effect of the homogenization treatment and rolling on the microstructure has been demonstrated. The homogenized alloy presents improved workability and machinability. Research limitations/implications: Based on the up to date achieved outcomes, it appears that homogeneous, fine microstructure and quite uniform distribution of the particles allow obtaining higher mechanical properties. The future research work will be oriented to get additional and detailed data on the performance of the alloy. Practical implications: The continuous increase of Al-based alloys in different applications involves manufacturing high integrity and superior performance components using cost-effective and safely processes. In this direction the research communities together with manufacturing industries are focusing their attention to develop new and enhanced products using innovative procedures. The central issue is the technological transfer to industry for affordable mass production.
