50|$|The <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Celeus grammicus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Picidae. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Peru, and Venezuela.|$|E
50|$|The {{birds of}} the Celeus genus {{generally}} weigh between 63 - 172 gm, the heaviest of this genus is the <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (C. grammicus). Length, from tip of bill to {{tip of the}} tail, is between 19-32 cm. They are generally not sexually dimorphic and have evolved specialised morphology to match their unique lifestyle.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the 15 {{species of}} Celeus are polytypic, with the C. occidentalis, C. tinnunculus, C. castaneus, C. galeatus and C. obrieni being {{exceptions}} as monotypic. Head markings {{were the main}} diagnostic feature for taxonomy until recent molecular phylogenetic analysis brought changes to the species list. Benz and Robbins (2011) in their DNA analysis of this genus found the species C. loricatus - C. torquatus as basal taxons. [...] Recent DNA analysis placed the rufous woodpecker, previously thought to belong to Celeus, in Micropternus brachyurus. [...] Sub species caatinga woodpecker (C. spectabilis obrieni) previously thought extinct was captured, using a mist net by A.D Prado in Tocantins in 2006, and was elevated in 2008 to Kaempfers woodpecker (C. obrieni). [...] The <b>scaly-breasted</b> <b>woodpecker's</b> English name has recently changed to scale-breasted woodpecker. The South Asian rufous woodpecker (Micropternus brachyurus) is a peculiar species that was formerly placed in Celeus too. However, its similarity seems {{to be due to}} convergent evolution, as it does not even seem to belong to the same tribe of Picinae as Celeus does.|$|R
