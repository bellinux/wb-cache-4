40|$|AbstractAs {{part of the}} Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP), {{butterflies}} {{were surveyed}} pretreatment and up to 4 yr posttreatment at 16 widely distributed sagebrush steppe sites in the interior West. Butterfly populations and communities were analyzed in response to treatments (prescribed fire, mechanical, herbicide) designed to restore sagebrush steppe lands encroached by piñon-juniper woodlands (Pinus, Juniperus spp.) and invaded by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). Butterflies exhibited distinct regional patterns of species composition, with communities showing marked variability among sites. Some variation was explained by the plant community, with Mantel's test indicating that ordinations of butterfly and plant communities were closely similar for both woodland sites and lower-elevation treeless (sage-cheat) sites. At woodland sites, responses to stand replacement prescribed fire, clear-cutting, and tree mastication treatments applied to 10 – 20 -ha plots were subtle: 1) no changes were observed in community structure; 2) Melissa blues (Plebejus melissa) and sulfurs (Colias spp.) increased in abundance after either burning or mechanical treatments, possibly due to increase in larval and nectar food resource, respectively; and 3) the juniper hairstreak (Callophrys gryneus) declined at sites at which it was initially present, probably due to removal of its larval food source. At sage-cheat sites, after prescribed fire was applied to 25 – 75 -ha plots, we observed 1) an increase in species richness and abundance at most sites, possibly due to increased nectar resources for adults, and 2) {{an increase in the}} abundance of skippers (Hesperiidae) and <b>small</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterflies.</b> Linkages between woody species removal, the release of herbaceous vegetation, and butterfly response to treatments demonstrate the importance of monitoring an array of ecosystem components in order to document the extent to which management practices cause unintended consequences...|$|R

40|$|The {{selection}} of a host plant for egg-laying is {{an important element in}} insect-plant relationships, the survival of the offspring often depends on the choices made by gravid females. Plants are diverse and not evenly distributed in space or time and insect females search for host plants at gradually finer spatial scales. To choose a host plant they use a combination of olfaction, vision, contact chemoreception and tactile senses and the resolution of those senses are important. Cruciferous crops are of economic importance and have a well known chemistry. Consequently the insects associated with them have received particular attention over the years. One such insect is the <b>small</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Pieris rapae, a well known and worldwide pest of cruciferous crops. The objective of this MSc thesis was to gain a greater insight in the short range host selection by females of the <b>small</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> and their use of senses at different spatial scales. This was done in the laboratory using three genotypes of Brassica oleracea, leaf models sprayed with extracts from those genotypes, and leaf models with different shape and colour. Three experiments were performed: one with plants, one with models differing in form sprayed with the same extract and one with identical models sprayed with different extracts. The genotypes or different models were distributed either evenly between three patches or concentrated in a single patch keeping the density constant. I found that the distribution of eggs on plants was not significantly affected by how the host plants were arranged but the egg distribution on the leaf models was affected. With the models differing in form the contrast increased with proximity and with the models differing in chemistry the contrast decreased with proximity. It is clear from this study that females of the <b>small</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> are able to distinguish between different host plants based on both visual appearance and chemistry, but that their relative importance varies with scale. Chemistry has more impact on a slightly larger scale while the visual aspects of the leaves have the most impact at a very fine scale when the contrasting leaves can be perceived simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|The eyes of {{the female}} <b>small</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Pieris rapae crucivora, are {{furnished}} with three classes of short-wavelength photoreceptors, with sensitivity peaks in the ultraviolet (UV) (lambda(max) = 360 nm), violet (V) (lambda max = 425 nm), and blue (B) (lambda(max) = 453 nm) wavelength range. Analyzing the spectral origin of the photoreceptors, we isolated three novel mRNAs encoding opsins corresponding to shortwavelength-absorbing visual pigments. We localized the opsin mRNAs in the retinal tissue and found {{that each of the}} short-wavelength-sensitive photoreceptor classes exclusively expresses one of the opsin mRNAs. We, accordingly, termed the visual pigments PrUV, PrV, and PrB, respectively. The {{eyes of the}} male <b>small</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> also use three classes of short-wavelength photoreceptors that equally uniquely express PrUV, PrV, and PrB. However, whereas the spectral sensitivities of the male photoreceptors with PrUV and PrB closely correspond to those of the female, the male photoreceptor expressing PrV has a double-peaked blue (dB) spectral sensitivity, strongly deviating from the spectral sensitivity of the female V photoreceptor. The male eyes contain a pigment that distinctly fluoresces under blue-violet as well as UV excitation light. It coexists with the dB photoreceptors and presumably acts as a spectral filter with an absorbance spectrum peaking at 416 nm. The narrow-band spectral sensitivity of the male dB photoreceptors probably evolved to improve the discrimination of the different wing colors of male and female P. rapae crucivora in the short-wavelength region of the spectrum...|$|E

40|$|Parasitic wasps {{employ a}} wide range of {{chemical}} cues to find their hosts. Very recently, we discovered how 2 closely related egg parasitoids, Trichogramma brassicae and Trichogramma evanescens, exploit the anti-aphrodisiac pheromone benzyl cyanide of one of their hosts, the gregarious large cabbage <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> Pieris brassicae that deposits a clutch of more than 20 eggs per oviposition bout. The pheromone is transferred by male butterflies to females during mating to enforce female monogamy. On detecting the anti-aphrodisiac, the tiny parasitic wasps ride on a mated female butterfly to a host plant and then parasitize her freshly laid eggs. The present study demonstrates that both wasp species similarly exploit the anti-aphrodisiac mixture of methyl salicylate and indole of another host, the more common solitary <b>small</b> cabbage <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> Pieris rapae that deposits only one egg at a time. Interestingly, this behavior is innate in T. brassicae, whereas T. evanescens learns it after one successful ride on a mated female butterfly. Moreover, we show that the wasps only respond to the anti-aphrodisiacs of the 2 cabbage <b>white</b> <b>butterflies</b> when the ubiquitous compounds are part of a complete mated female odor blend. Obviously, parasitic wasps use the sophisticated espionage-and-ride strategy to find eggs of different gregarious and solitary host species. From the wasps' perspective {{there seems to be a}} trade-off between the abundance and egg-laying behavior of the butterflies. Our findings suggest that Pieris butterflies are under strong selective pressure to minimize the use of an anti-aphrodisiac. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

Here, we compare the development time, pupal mass, and survival of two closely related oligophagous herbivore species on {{two species of}} brassicaceous plants that grow in different habitats and which exhibit little overlap in temporal growth phenology. In central Europe, the green-veined <b>white</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Pieris napi L., is bivoltine, whereas the <b>small</b> cabbage <b>white</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Pieris rapae L., has two to three generations a year. Moreover, P. napi is primarily found in moist, open (e. g., meadow), and forest habitats, whereas P. rapae prefers drier, open habitats. Both butterflies were reared on Garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), which is shade-tolerant and grows early in spring in forest undergrowth, and Black mustard (Brassica nigra), which prefers open disturbed habitats and is most common in summer. Both host plant species differ in other traits such as secondary chemistry. We hypothesized that, owing to habitat preference, P. napi would develop equally well on both plants but that P. rapae would perform better on B. nigra The results provide partial support for this hypothesis, as both herbivores performed equally well on A. petiolata and B. nigra However, there were differences in these parameters that were species-specific: on both plants P. rapae developed faster and had larger pupae than P. napi Our results show that specialized herbivores can exploit different species of related plants that grow {{at different times of}} the season, enabling them to have multiple generations...|$|R
