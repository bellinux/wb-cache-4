500|$|For the {{research}} facility at [...] "Taskerlands", Kneale {{was influenced by}} a visit he had paid to the BBC's research and development facility which was based at an old country house at Kingswood Warren in Kingswood, Surrey. Similarly, {{the research}}ers working at Kingswood Warren influenced the portrayal {{of the members of}} the Ryan research team in The Stone Tape. Kneale recalled of his visit to Kingswood Warren, [...] "The sort of impression you got of the folk who worked there was a boyishness. [...] They were very cheerful. It was all rather fun for them, which is a very clever way to go about doing that sort of heavy research... They were nice chaps– and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> some very nice chaps for the TV version".|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Kirchherr and her art school friends were {{involved}} in the European existentialist movement whose followers were later nicknamed [...] "Exis" [...] by Lennon. In 1995 she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "Our philosophy then, because we were only little kids, was wearing black clothes and going around looking moody. Of course, we hadn't a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get. England was so far away, and America was out of the question. So France was the nearest. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> all the information from France, and we tried to dress like the French existentialists... We wanted to be free, we wanted to be different, and tried to be cool, as we call it now." ...|$|E
500|$|Gorillaz are a British virtual band {{created in}} 1998 by Damon Albarn of rock band Blur, and Jamie Hewlett, co-creator {{of the comic}} book Tank Girl. While {{watching}} MTV, Hewlett {{came up with the}} idea to create the band, and later commented, [...] "if you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell – there's nothing of substance there. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> this idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that." [...] Gorillaz is a virtual band consisting of four cartoon characters: 2D, Murdoc, Noodle and Russel. They are used in promotional material such as album covers, posters, and in concerts, during which holographic versions of the characters are used. The band's music is a collaboration between various musicians; Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor. Gorillaz have released five studio albums, all on the Parlophone and Virgin record labels: Gorillaz (2001), Demon Days (2005), Plastic Beach (2010), The Fall (digital in 2010, physical in 2011), Humanz (2017).|$|E

500|$|The final {{segment is}} based on the Halloween cartoon It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. It could not be titled [...] "It's the Great Pumpkin, Milhouse" [...] to exactly match its namesake because of a [...] "big legal issue", {{according}} to Al Jean. However, the characters were redesigned to resemble the style of Peanuts, and they also obtained rights to use Vince Guaraldi's music. Jean said in 2011 that [...] "For years we {{had never been able to}} parody Charlie Brown's Halloween special, which is one of the all-time top three animated shows ever. The Vince Guaraldi music is such a huge part of it, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to clear it. It was just a dream come true to satirize it. I thought it was a really funny idea that instead of not ever seeing the Grand Pumpkin, it comes to life, and he's really horrified at the way humans cook pumpkins into pies, and eat pumpkin seeds, which are basically pumpkin fetuses...." ...|$|E
500|$|Craig {{spoke about}} the Battle of Hogwarts to Art Insights Magazine, saying that [...] "the great {{challenge}} is the destruction of Hogwarts. The sun rising behind the smoke ... the massive remains of destroyed walls, the entrance hall, {{the entrance of the}} Great Hall, part of the roof of the Great Hall completely gone, so yeah. A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really– maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely." [...] When asked about the King's Cross scene {{near the end of the}} film, Craig said, [...] "We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white– so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there but with a great deal of preparation and research." ...|$|E
500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s do it all on rock instruments and let David arrange it, but that wasn’t really thinking ahead in terms of who we are. When we go into the studio, we tend to work on things until they’re pretty polished. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> into what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings where we wanted to hear strings, choir where we wanted choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, because we knew it was all going to be replaced with real players." [...] Once the album's arrangements were complete, they were performed and recorded in studios around the world, with Campbell conducting and leading the sessions from Los Angeles.|$|E

2500|$|A {{small group}} of IRA members {{and members of the}} Citizens' Defence Committee took up {{positions}} in the church grounds and in adjoining streets. The IRA members were armed with M1 carbines and were led by Billy McKee, commander of the IRA's Belfast Brigade. Also present was Billy Kelly, commander of the Belfast Brigade's 3rd Battalion. The IRA members fired at the loyalists, some of whom were positioned on the roofs opposite. Jim Magee, a local loyalist, said he saw wounded people lying on the road and asked the police (RUC) for help. According to Magee, [...] " [...] said 'if you have anything, get it out and protect your people'. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> an old rifle and went into Frazer Street and started firing back".|$|E
2500|$|The idea {{to create}} Gorillaz came about when Albarn and Hewlett were {{watching}} MTV. Hewlett said, [...] "If you watch MTV for too long, it's {{a bit like}} hell– there's nothing of substance there. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> this idea for a cartoon band, {{something that would be}} a comment on that." [...] The band originally identified themselves as [...] "Gorilla" [...] and the first song they recorded was [...] "Ghost Train" [...] which was later released as a B-side on their single [...] "Rock the House" [...] and the B-side compilation G Sides. The musicians behind Gorillaz' first incarnation included Albarn, Del the Funky Homosapien, Dan the Automator and Kid Koala, who had previously worked together on the track [...] "Time Keeps on Slipping" [...] for Deltron 3030's eponymous debut album.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{appeared}} in a sequence for the film God's Not Dead, released in 2014. Michael Tait expressed excitement about the film to The Global Dispatch during an interview, saying that [...] "The movie is powerful because of the whole stance of it…just trying to prove God's existence…sharing the gospel, living the lifestyle, changing the mindset of people around them in this college, in this university." [...] Duncan Phillips added in a similar interview that [...] "Disney's Shane Harper plays a college student whose faith is challenged by his professor, played by Kevin Sorbo from Hercules. Dean Cain from Superman is in it, too. <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> {{to hang out with}} a bunch of superheroes. The movie raises a lot of questions and a lot of eyebrows from a culture that questions if there is a God." ...|$|E

The band's music is a collaboration between various musicians, Albarn being the only permanent musical contributor. Their style is broadly alternative rock, but with a large number of other influences including Britpop, dub, hip-hop, and pop music. In 2001, the band's eponymous debut album sold over seven million copies, and featured hits such as the songs [...] "19-2000" [...] and [...] "Clint Eastwood," [...] earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize 2001, but the nomination was later withdrawn at the band's request.|$|E
2500|$|The organ on [...] "Jane Seymour" [...] was {{recorded}} at St Giles-without-Cripplegate church in London. [...] "I couldn't reproduce the sound I needed on an electronic organ, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> permission {{to move the}} recording equipment into St Giles" [...] said Wakeman. [...] "It was quite an experience playing a lovely instrument like that." [...] While recording [...] "Anne Boleyn" [...] at Morgan Studios, featuring Yes drummer Bill Bruford, a dream Wakeman had about attending her execution caused him to include a version of [...] "St. Clement", the tune to the hymn [...] "The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended" [...] written by John Ellerton. Though E. J. Hopkins is credited on the album, the piece is generally attributed to Reverend Clement Scholefield. Wakeman also plays a rare portative organ made in the 1700s with reeds and wooden pipes, giving it a [...] "breathy" [...] sound that he compared to someone's breath.|$|E
