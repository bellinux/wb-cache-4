25|$|In 1835, Tocqueville made {{a journey}} through Ireland. His {{observations}} provide {{one of the best}} pictures of how Ireland <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Great Famine (1845–49). The observations chronicle the growing Catholic middle-class and the appalling conditions in which most Catholic tenant farmers lived. Tocqueville made clear both his libertarian sympathies and his affinity for his Irish co-religionists.|$|E
25|$|After {{the murder}} of Pertinax (28 March 193), the Praetorian assassins {{announced}} that the throne was {{to be sold to}} the man who would pay the highest price. Titus Flavius Claudius Sulpicianus, prefect of the city, father-in-law of the murdered emperor, being at that moment in the camp to which he had been sent to calm the troops, began making offers, whereupon Julianus, having been roused from a banquet by his wife and daughter, arrived in all haste, and being unable to gain admission, <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> gate, and with a loud voice competed for the prize.|$|E
25|$|Public furore {{attracted}} interest of various other would-be inventors {{who wanted to}} demonstrate their own death rays to the War Office. None of them were convincing. On 28 May Commander Kenworthy asked in the House of Commons what the government intended to do to stop Matthews from selling the ray to a foreign power. The Under Secretary for Air answered that Matthews {{was not willing to}} let them investigate the ray to their satisfaction. A government representative also stated that one ministry official had <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> ray and survived. Newspapers continued to root for Matthews.|$|E

25|$|She {{described}} the Temple of Seti as like entering a time machine, where the past becomes {{the present and}} the modern mind has difficulty understanding a world in which magic is accepted. She claimed that the scenes depicted on the temple walls were active in the minds of ancient Egyptians on two levels. Firstly, they made the actions displayed permanent. The painting of Pharaoh offering bread to Osiris, for example, continued his actions so long as the depiction remained. Secondly, the image could be animated by the spirit of the god, if the person <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> depiction and called on the god's name.|$|E
25|$|A good {{description}} of the House as it <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> siege {{is found in the}} Marquis's own Diary. Basing House stood on a rising ground, its form circular, encompassed with brick ramparts lined with earth, and a very deep ditch but dry. The lofty Gate-house, with four Turrets, looking Northwards, on the right hand thereof, without the ditch, a goodly building containing two fair courts; before them was the Grange, severed by a wall and common road, etc. Some idea of the magnitude of the place may be founds when it is remembered that from a survey made in 1798 the area of the works including gardens and entrenchments, covered about fourteen and a half acres.|$|E
25|$|On 5 January 1967, the ten men of Team Cobra boarded Air America Sikorsky H-34 helicopters. The {{defector}} accompanied them. They {{were dropped}} {{in a clearing}} two days walk from Ban Naden. In {{the early morning hours}} of 7 January, they crept down a creek bed toward the prison camp. Although triple canopy jungle hindered aerial observation, the ground team could see a pair of cave mouths at the base of a 500-meter cliff face. As the cave entrances were six meters across, about 20 prisoners could be seen penned behind each set of bamboo bars. Two bamboo huts <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> cave mouths. There were also holding cells sunken in the ground.|$|E

25|$|When French {{troops had}} {{approached}} the rivers Rhine and Meuse in November 1794, the Patriots started {{to prepare for}} a revolution and to stockpile weapons. The hiding place was discovered, and Jacobus van Staphorst and Cornelis Rudolphus Theodorus Krayenhoff had to leave the city to avoid being captured. The society in the Kalverstraat was closed down by the police and Wiselius, the president, had to announce the message to its members. In January 1795 Wiselius and Nicolaas van Staphorst were part of the revolutionary committee that occupied the townhall. Wiselius <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> city government in the nearby townhall on the Dam Square to state that the time had arrived for them to resign. The next morning, the new leaders moved in without much ado and voted Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck as their president. Stadholder William V escaped by boat from the beach near the Hague to England; there were no casualties and it is known as a velvet revolution.|$|E
25|$|Blue Panther Jr. was {{scheduled}} {{to compete in the}} third match of the night, an En Busca de un Ídolo match, but was replaced by Hechicero with the only explanation was that Blue Panther Jr. was not able to be at the show due to Force majeure.

For his effort Diamante Azul gave him 8 points, Hijo del Gladiador 8, Shocker 8 and El Tirantes 10 points for a total of 34. The judges were less positive for Canelo Casas' assessment with Casas receiving 7, 7, 7 and 8 points for a total of 29.|$|E
25|$|When such a {{complete}} convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, {{or in the}} Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness {{as well as other}} inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they <b>stood,</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.|$|E

[...] Coolbrith was commissioned to write a poem for the Exposition, and in October 1893 she brought with her to Chicago the poem [...] "Isabella of Spain" [...] to help dedicate Harriet Hosmer's sculpture Queen Isabella which <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Pampas Plume Palace within the California Pavilion. Listening to Coolbrith were well-known women such as suffragist Susan B. Anthony and journalist Lilian Whiting. During Coolbrith's visit, Charlotte Perkins Stetson, her friend from the Pacific Coast Woman's Press Association (the two women served as president and vice-president, respectively), wrote to May Wright Sewall on her behalf; Stetson observed that Coolbrith could benefit from introductions to Chicago's best writers.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} 1968 election, Agnew was still {{uncertain}} what Nixon would expect {{of him as}} vice president. He met with Nixon several days after the election in Key Biscayne, Florida. Nixon, vice president himself for eight years under Eisenhower, wanted to spare Agnew the boredom and lack of a role he had sometimes experienced in that office. Nixon gave Agnew {{an office in the}} West Wing of the White House, a first for a vice president. When they <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> press after the meeting, Nixon pledged that Agnew would not have to undertake the ceremonial roles usually undertaken by the holders of the vice presidency, but would have [...] "new duties beyond what any vice president has previously assumed". Nixon told the press that he planned to make full use of Agnew's experience as county executive and as governor in dealing with matters of federal-state relations and in urban affairs.|$|E

Brown <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> House and said, [...] "yes". Cameron quoted from a letter written by Labour's Chief Whip Geoff Hoon to Keith Vazthe Chairman of the Home Affairs Committeein which Hoon expressed deep thanks for Vaz's support and closed the letter with the line, [...] "I trust {{that you will be}} appropriately rewarded". Hoon said that this was just a joke between friends but others, such as Conservative leader David Cameron and Shadow Home Secretary David Davis viewed this letter as proof that deals were indeed done behind the scenes and that Brown lied on the record when he said there had been none. The House of Lords defeated the bill, which Lords said was [...] "fatally flawed, ill thought through and unnecessary", stating that [...] "it seeks to further erode...fundamental legal and civil rights".|$|E

This answer being told the king, and his lordship approaching nearer the throne, was required by his majesty to explain himself, which he did to this effect: [...] "May it please your majesty, my name is Courcy, and I am Lord of Kingsale in your kingdom of Ireland: the reason of my appearing covered in your majesty's presence is, to assert the ancient privilege of my family, granted to sir John de Courcy, earl of Ulster, and his heirs, by John, king of England, for him and his successors for ever." [...] The king replied, he remembered he had such a nobleman, and believed the privilege he asserted to be his right, and giving him his hand to kiss, his lordship paid his obeisance, and remained covered.|$|E
