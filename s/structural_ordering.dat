Syntactic units are present; constituents and phrases are identified; they correspond to complete subtrees. An important aspect of these stemmas is that they are [...] "unordered", i.e. they do not reflect actual word <b>order.</b> For Tesnière, <b>structural</b> <b>order</b> (hierarchical order) preceded linear order in the mind of a speaker. A speaker first conceives of what he/she wants to say, whereby this conception consists of words organized hierarchically in terms of connections (<b>structural</b> <b>order).</b> The act of speaking involves transforming <b>structural</b> <b>order</b> to linear order, and conversely, the act of hearing and understanding involves transforming linear <b>order</b> to <b>structural</b> <b>order.</b> This strict separation of the ordering dimensions is a point of contention among modern dependency grammars. Some dependency grammars, i.e. the stratified ones (e.g. Meaning-text theory and Functional generative description) build on this strict separation of <b>structural</b> <b>order</b> and linear order, whereas other dependency grammars (e.g. Word grammar) are monostratal (in syntax) and hence reject the separation.|$|R

40|$|The present {{investigation}} examines {{the relationship between}} <b>structural</b> <b>order,</b> diffusivity anomalies, and density anomalies in liquid silica by means of molecular dynamics simulations. We use previously defined orientational and translational order parameters to quantify local <b>structural</b> <b>order</b> in atomic configurations. Extensive simulations are performed at different state points to measure <b>structural</b> <b>order,</b> diffusivity, and thermodynamic properties. It is found that silica shares many trends recently reported for water [J. R. Errington and P. G. Debenedetti, Nature 409, 318 (2001) ]. At intermediate densities, the distribution of local orientational order is bimodal. At fixed temperature, order parameter extrema occur upon compression: a maximum in orientational order followed by a minimum in translational order. Unlike water, however, silica's translational order parameter minimum is broad, {{and there is no}} range of thermodynamic conditions where both parameters are strictly coupled. Furthermore, the temperature-density regime where both <b>structural</b> <b>order</b> parameters decrease upon isothermal compression (the structurally anomalous regime) does not encompass the region of diffusivity anomalies, as was the case for water.

We found that the anisotropic response for the probe polarization appeared at around T-g, where the glasslike structural transition occurs. The anisotropy can be a result of a transient destruction of the local ordering of molecules, indicating a connection between the glasslike transition and PIPS. Moreover, we found that the PIPS response gradually develops with decreasing temperature in k-Br, whereas it steeply increases in k-NCS.

The most important factor effecting the state of equilibrium of any <b>structural</b> <b>order</b> is the force of gravity. Differantiation in the <b>structural</b> <b>orders</b> formed under this stable effect {{can be explained by the}} change in the concept of equilibrium. Therefore, analysing the change in architectural and engineering end-products could only be done by understanding the change in the concept of equilibrium. Scientific developments are the basic factors causing the changes in the concept of equilibrium. Reflections of these developments on concrete products is both in the types of load transfer of <b>structural</b> <b>order</b> and in visual expression of order. Consequently, in the scope of the thesis, depending on developments in the science reflections of the change in the concept of equilibrium on concrete products is tried to be explained by structural and geometrical analses. Expression of these analyses are made through the relationship between equilibrium and movement. It is concluded that the change in the <b>structural</b> <b>orders</b> basing on an acceptance of basic physics that "an object is either stable or movable "; is from structures having no motion to structures having any kind of motion (having tendency to move and/or moving). In other words, it can be said that, this change is from immobile structures having whole connection with the ground, to structures trying to remove from the ground. At the end, in today, it is possible to discuss about solutions having different equilibrium orders that is seen/will be seen basing on scientific developments. Generally it is possible to classify these solutions as solutions that can be expressed by different geometrical orders or solutions towards to be independent from the force of gravity. in the light of these determinations the aim of the thesis is to determine changes in the concept of equilibrium and to analyse their effects on structural end-products and to give some clues about their future effects.
