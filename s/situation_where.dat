5|$|Host-{{parasite}} mimicry is a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> {{a parasite}} mimics its own host. As with mimicry {{of the female}} sex outlined previously, only two species are involved, the model and mimic being of the same species. Brood parasitism, a form of kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism, is one such <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> host-parasite mimicry has evolved. Pasteur terms this form of aggressive-reproductive mimicry Kirbyan mimicry, after the English entomologist William Kirby.|$|E
5|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry and theoretical physics, mirror symmetry {{is a relationship}} between geometric objects called Calabi–Yau manifolds. The term refers to a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> two Calabi–Yau manifolds look very different geometrically but are nevertheless equivalent when employed as extra dimensions of string theory.|$|E
5|$|In {{domestic}} non-electronic identification {{the driving}} licence has remained in a leading position, {{since most of}} the population have to have a licence anyway, and a driving licence is valid for almost every <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> non-electronic personal identification is needed.|$|E

5|$|Further south, near Mount St. Helens, is {{a similar}} <b>situation,</b> <b>where</b> the St. Helens Fault Zone (SHZ) is {{believed}} to be the eastern edge of the Crescent Formation, but the pre-Cenozoic continental basement is near Mount Rainier. Separating these is the marine sedimentary formation known as the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor (SWCC); it is possible that it was deposited over a fragment of Siletzia. Or not: the oldest parts of the SWCC likely predate Siletzia, and the nature and location of the contact between these two formations is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In Trinsey v. Pennsylvania (1991), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit {{was faced}} with a <b>situation</b> <b>where,</b> {{following}} the death of Senator H.John HeinzIII of Pennsylvania, Governor Robert P. Casey had provided for a replacement and for a special election that did not include a primary. A voter and prospective candidate, John S. Trinsey,Jr., argued that the lack of a primary violated the Seventeenth Amendment and his right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Third Circuit rejected these arguments, ruling that the Seventeenth Amendment does not require primaries.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the term}} duality {{refers to a}} <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> two {{seemingly}} different physical systems {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.|$|E
50|$|Experimental {{evidence}} {{demonstrates that}} the proportionator significantly reduces the variance between samples, especially in <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> the tissue distribution is heterogeneous. This means that the <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> {{it is harder to}} reduce the variance, or improve the CE, are just the <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> the proportionator excels. Another way to look at this is that the proportionator is designed to take the CE reduction issue {{out of the hands of}} the researcher.|$|R
25|$|There {{are some}} medical <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> the NEF will be {{deployed}} automatically; those are usually pediatric emergencies, {{patients who are}} unconscious, emergencies including neurological or cardiovascular conditions, mass-casualty incidents, and <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> the need for analgesics and anesthetics is foreseeable.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a theory for timed systems which relate to time granularity. We use the well known {{equivalence}} of bisimulation {{to study the}} effect of changing granularity. We identify <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> measuring time more accurately {{has no effect on}} the equivalence. Similarly we also present a few <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> measuring time less accurately has no effect on the equivalence. We also present properties of the <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> the semantics is indeed altered by a change in time granularity...|$|R
5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface {{can result in a}} <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
5|$|The Brander–Spencer {{model is}} an {{economic}} model in international trade originally developed by James Brander and Barbara Spencer in the early 1980s. The model illustrates a <b>situation</b> <b>where,</b> under certain assumptions, a government can subsidize domestic firms to help them in their competition against foreign producers {{and in doing so}} enhances national welfare. This conclusion stands in contrast to results from most international trade models, in which government non-interference is socially optimal.|$|E

In domestic non-electronic identification the driving licence has remained in a leading position. A driving licence is valid for almost every <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> non-electronic personal identification is needed even though they are not officially recognized as such.|$|E
50|$|Recursive {{three-way}} merge {{can only}} be used in <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> the tool has knowledge about the total ancestry directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the derivatives to be merged.

(Most of us probably don't have any clear intuitions regarding the truth conditions of the sentence [...] "If I {{go out in the}} sun, I will get sunburned" [...] in <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> I never go out in the sun.) An explication of the conditional will also specify truth conditions for <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> [...] "p" [...] is not true.|$|R
5|$|The mirror {{symmetry}} {{relationship is}} a particular example of what physicists call a duality. In general, the term duality refers to a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> two seemingly different physical theories {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. If one theory can be transformed so it looks just like another theory, the two are said to be dual under that transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena. Such dualities {{play an important role in}} modern physics, especially in string theory.|$|E
5|$|The regulars found {{themselves}} {{trapped in a}} <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> they were both outnumbered and outmaneuvered. Lacking effective leadership and terrified at the superior numbers of the enemy, with their spirit broken, and likely not having experienced combat before, they abandoned their wounded, and fled {{to the safety of}} the approaching grenadier companies coming from the town center, isolating Captain Parsons and the companies searching for arms at Barrett's Farm.|$|E
5|$|As the society, Durkheim noted {{there are}} several {{possible}} pathologies {{that could lead to}} a breakdown of social integration and disintegration of the society: the two most important ones are anomie and forced division of labour; lesser ones include the lack of coordination and suicide. By anomie Durkheim means a state when too rapid population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (norms, values, and so on). By forced division of labour Durkheim means a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> power holders, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in people doing the work they are unsuited for. Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.|$|E

50|$|Communicating finite state {{machines}} {{can be the}} most powerful in <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> the propagation delay is not negligible (so that several messages can be in transit at one time) and in <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> it is natural to describe the protocol parties and the communication medium as separate entities.|$|R
5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E
5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited {{regardless of whether the}} vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E
5|$|If {{opportunity}} costs are constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced. This case reflects a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> resources are not specialised {{and can be}} substituted for each other with no added cost. Products requiring similar resources (bread and pastry, for instance) will have an almost straight PPF and so almost constant {{opportunity costs}}. More specifically, with constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if {{there was only one}} factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve. With varying returns to scale, however, it may not be entirely linear in either case.|$|E
50|$|It {{is useful}} to {{differentiate}} inflammation and infection as there are many pathological <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> inflammation is not driven by microbial invasion - for example, atherosclerosis, type III hypersensitivity, trauma, ischaemia. There are also pathological <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> microbial invasion does not result in classic inflammatory response—for example, parasitosis, eosinophilia.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} said that an error of fact {{involves}} a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> there are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E
5|$|Not in Front of the Children {{explores the}} {{development}} of U.S. case law with different standards of censorship for children and adults. The author describes a 1968 Supreme Court of the United States case, Ginsberg v. New York, where the court upheld a law preventing minors from viewing sexually explicit media. Sam Ginsberg and his wife managed a diner in Bellmore, New York. A mother sent her 16-year-old son to buy two adult magazines at the diner, creating a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> Ginsberg would be prosecuted. Ginsberg was convicted of violating a New York State law which forbade selling magazines with pictures of nude women to minors.|$|E
5|$|On June 22 the FIA {{produced}} {{a press release}} from Max Mosley, {{in the form of}} a question-and-answer session, in an effort to clarify the FIA's stand on the controversy. In it Mosley drew an analogy to a hypothetical <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> the engines from one manufacturer had oil starvation problems due to high lateral loading in one corner, and pointed out that those cars would simply have been forced to run slower as a result. He reiterated that the reason for not installing the chicane was purely that it had never been tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. He pointed out that the alternatives that the FIA suggested were feasible, and wondered why the teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.|$|E
