40|$|This paper gives {{a summary}} on {{advanced}} piezocomposite transducers and {{the perspective of}} their applications {{in the field of}} smart structures, health monitoring and diagnostics. At present, three different low profile piezocomposite actuator types are commercially available. The designs are arising from the R&D work at MIT in the years 1991 / 92 funded by the US Department of <b>Defence.</b> <b>Smart</b> Material is manufacturing Macro Fiber Composites (MFC), licensed by NASA in a full-scale production. A new MFC- design using the 3 - 1 coupling has been developed, recently. It allows for the reduction of drive voltage down to 360 V. Fraunhofer IKTS focused its development on custom shape composites making use of PZT tubes and plates. New actuator devices for active interfaces have been introduced for the first time. All piezocomposite design forms show different performance data, which are summarised in the present paper to provide design engineers with necessary informations in view of intended applications...|$|R
40|$|The ongoing {{economic}} crisis forces seeking solutions enabling {{the development of}} NATO's defence capabilities {{in the era of}} cuts in defence budgets. An example of this is <b>Smart</b> <b>Defence</b> initiative, which allows member states to participate in multinational projects oriented into the needs of the whole NATO. Capabilities in the area of aviation are considered as one of the key priorities of NATO, somany projects in <b>Smart</b> <b>Defence</b> initiative relate to aviation. The article is divided into two parts. The first presents the key assumptions of <b>Smart</b> <b>Defence</b> initiative, it also points out its limitations. The second part reviews the major programs and initiatives in the area of aviation enhancing NATO’s defence capabilities. Tadeusz Zielińsk...|$|E
40|$|This CEPS Commentary {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the Chicago NATO Summit (May 20 - 21) and the <b>Smart</b> <b>Defence</b> agenda on the European Union’s defence policy. Will the EU follow NATO and go ‘smart’? The authors point out that the NATO agenda provides indeed a unique chance for the EU to make unprecedented progress on pooling and sharing. They outline a three-part road map to rationalise the EU defence market and put the Union back on track as a credible and capable security provider. The Commentary also stresses that complementarity between the NATO and EU agenda is all important to achieve long-term change...|$|E
40|$|Defence and {{security}} related issues are constantly changing. Many {{of the current}} platforms which encourage international cooperation between countries was created during the end of previous wars. This has also strengthened a will to maintain stability and peace through collective defence. Nato is today an organisation that plays an intricate role of importance of further investments towards a better global security, and the initiation of <b>Smart</b> <b>Defence</b> {{was a way to}} achieve that. This thesis focuses on the concept of <b>Smart</b> <b>Defence</b> in a Scandinavian context. The aim of the thesis is to examine to what extent the concept {{is to be found in}} the Scandinavian countries’ defence {{and security}} strategies, in what ways this concept is manifested and how relevant the concept is to Scandinavia. With the outset of examining strategic documents, the thesis is performing a qualitative concept analysis. Adopting the concept definition of Carl Lagerström, the analysis is performed by a constructed coding and analysis scheme, in which separate categories have been created to represent the crucial ideas of the concept. The results show that even though the Scandinavian countries are similar in many ways, they differ in terms of their relationship to Nato. While none of the Scandinavian countries entirely correspond to concept in a Scandinavian context, it is notable that Sweden is the only country to be in line with more than one category of the conceptual framework. Norway and Denmark, in the light of their commitment to Nato, show none or little correspondence to the concept from a Scandinavian point of view. Regarding the relevance of the concept, we consider it to be potentially high because of their common threat scenarios and the emphasis on improving the effective use of resources. ...|$|E
40|$|The Scottish government's {{white paper}} on independence, Scotland's future, sets out its defence {{blueprint}} following a 'yes' vote. It {{makes clear that}} its defence plans {{would be subject to}} a Strategic Defence and Security Review in 2016, as well as negotiation on the division of assets with London. However, it also provides a strong indication of how it envisages its defence posture as an independent state-a major pillar of which is founded upon strong and continued defence cooperation {{with the rest of the}} United Kingdom. Is this a realistic assumption? And, if so, how would it work in practice? Contextualized by the increased emphasis on defence cooperation which sits at the heart of NATO's <b>Smart</b> <b>Defence</b> initiative, as well as the European Defence Agency's 'pooling and sharing' programme, the article assesses the benefits and challenges that might be encountered in a defence cooperation agreement between an independent Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom in the event of a 'yes' vote in September's referendum...|$|E
40|$|The Visegrad Group needs {{success stories}} if its defence {{co-operation}} is to develop. The recent differences between Poland {{and the rest}} of the region, as well as the closing window of opportunity to improve interoperability through the ISAF mission, make the hunger for concrete examples of co-operation even more urgent. Education and training projects are not only comparatively easily to implement in terms of time and money, but also represent a way of bringing the region’s civilian and military leaders closer together in terms of strategic thinking. Regional defence collaboration is also one of the ways to materialize NATO’s <b>Smart</b> <b>Defence</b> agenda. For the whole region, the way to keep Visegrad defence cooperation alive is not straightforward and certain, but it is likely to prove rewarding in the long term. It presents not only a chance to keep the whole region better prepared militarily, but also to build a more cohesive strategic awareness, thanks to intensive communication at all levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{contracting}} defence budgets in Europe, {{the difficulties}} in developing the EU’s security policy, NATO's transformation, the reorientation of US security policy and the problems experienced by European defence industries – all together have in recent years created an increased interest in political, military and military-technological co-operation in Europe. It has manifested itself in concepts of closer co-operation within NATO and the EU (<b>smart</b> <b>defence</b> and pooling&sharing), bilateral and multilateral initiatives outside the structures of NATO and the EU (such as the Nordic Defence Co-operation or the Franco-British co-operation) and debates about the prerequisites, principles and objectives of bilateral, multilateral and regional security and defence co-operation. The present report aims to analyse the potential for security and defence co-operation among selected countries in the area between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, i. e. the Nordic states (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), the Baltic states (Lithuania Latvia and Estonia), Poland's partners in the Visegrad Group (the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia) as well as Romania and Bulgaria. The authors were guided by the assumption that those states are Poland's natural partners for closer regional military co-operation. It may complement ‘the Western’ direction of Poland's security and defence policy, i. e. relations with the partners from the Weimar Triangle and the US. Its {{goal is not to}} replace the existing security structures but rather to strengthen military capabilities in the region within NATO and the EU...|$|E
