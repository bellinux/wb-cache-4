25|$|Screening {{consists}} of a blood test that detects hepatitis B <b>surface</b> <b>antigen</b> (HBsAg). If HBsAg is present, a second test – usually done on the same blood sample – that detects the antibody for the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBcAg) can differentiate between acute and chronic infection. People who are high-risk whose blood tests negative for HBsAg can receive the hepatitis B vaccine to prevent future infection.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, they {{discovered}} {{another type of}} <b>surface</b> <b>antigen</b> from the same Camp and St. Lucia strains of malarial parasites. This was also a large-sized protein of about 300 kDa, but {{quite different from the}} antigens reported in 1984. The new protein was unable to bind to melanoma cells and present only inside the cell. Hence, they named the earlier protein Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), to distinguish it from the newly identified Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 2 (PfEMP2). The distinction was confirmed the next year, with an additional information that PfEMP1 is relatively less in number.|$|E

500|$|The DNA {{polymerase}} is encoded by gene P. Gene S is {{the gene}} that codes for the <b>surface</b> <b>antigen</b> (HBsAg). The HBsAg gene is one long open reading frame but contains three in frame [...] "start" [...] (ATG) codons that divide the gene into three sections, pre-S1, pre-S2, and S. Because of the multiple start codons, polypeptides of three different sizes called large (the order from surface to the inside: pre-S1, pre-S2, and S [...] ), middle (pre-S2, S), and small (S) [...] are produced. The function of the protein coded for by gene X is not fully understood but it {{is associated with the}} development of liver cancer.

500|$|The [...] <b>surface</b> <b>antigen</b> (HBsAg) is most {{frequently}} used to screen {{for the presence of}} this infection. It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection. However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host. The infectious virion contains an inner [...] "core particle" [...] enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core particle is made of 180 or 240 copies of the core protein, alternatively known as [...] core antigen, or HBcAg. During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies specific to the [...] core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only serological evidence of disease. [...] Therefore, most [...] diagnostic panels contain HBsAg and total anti-HBc (both IgM and IgG).|$|E
500|$|... virus DNA [...] {{persists}} {{in the body}} after infection, and in some people the disease recurs. Although rare, reactivation is seen most often following alcohol or drug use, or in people with impaired immunity. HBV goes through cycles of replication and non-replication. Approximately 50% of overt carriers experience acute reactivation. Males with baseline ALT of 200 UL/L are {{three times more likely}} to develop a reactivation than people with lower levels. Although reactivation can occur spontaneously, people who undergo chemotherapy have a higher risk. [...] Immunosuppressive drugs favor increased HBV replication while inhibiting cytotoxic T cell function in the liver. The risk of reactivation varies depending on the serological profile; those with detectable HBsAg in their blood are at the greatest risk, but those with only antibodies to the core antigen are also at risk. The presence of antibodies to the <b>surface</b> <b>antigen,</b> which are considered to be a marker of immunity, does not preclude reactivation.

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} an epidemic caused by [...] virus was made by Lurman in 1885. An outbreak of smallpox occurred in Bremen in 1883 and 1,289 shipyard employees were vaccinated with lymph from other people. After several weeks, and up to eight months later, 191 of the vaccinated workers became ill with jaundice and were diagnosed as suffering from serum hepatitis. Other employees who had been inoculated with different batches of lymph remained healthy. Lurman's paper, now regarded as a classical example of an epidemiological study, proved that contaminated lymph {{was the source of}} the outbreak. Later, numerous similar outbreaks were reported following the introduction, in 1909, of hypodermic needles that were used, and, more importantly, reused, for administering Salvarsan for the treatment of syphilis. The virus was not discovered until 1966 when Baruch Blumberg, then working at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), discovered the Australia antigen (later known to be [...] <b>surface</b> <b>antigen,</b> or HBsAg) in the blood of Australian aboriginal people. Although a virus had been suspected since the research published by Frederick MacCallum in 1947, David Dane and others discovered the virus particle in 1970 by electron microscopy. By the early 1980s the genome of the virus had been sequenced, and the first vaccines were being tested.|$|E
2500|$|When {{molecules}} on {{the surface}} of a cell are crosslinked, they are moved to one end of the cell to form a [...] "cap".

The crosslinking is most easily achieved using a polyvalent antibody to a <b>surface</b> <b>antigen</b> on the cell. Cap formation can be visualised by attaching a fluorophore, such as fluorescein, to the antibody.|$|E
2500|$|Herd {{immunity}} itself acts as {{an evolutionary}} pressure on certain viruses, influencing viral evolution by encouraging the production of novel strains, in this case referred to as escape mutants, {{that are able to}} [...] "escape" [...] from herd immunity and spread more easily. At the molecular level, viruses escape from herd immunity through antigenic drift, which is when mutations accumulate in the portion of the viral genome that encodes for the virus's <b>surface</b> <b>antigen,</b> typically a protein of the virus capsid, producing a change in the viral epitope. Alternatively, the reassortment of separate viral genome segments, or antigenic shift, which is more common when there are more strains in circulation, can also produce new serotypes. When either of these occur, memory T cells no longer recognize the virus, so herd immunity ceases to be relevant to the dominant circulating strain. For both influenza and norovirus, epidemics temporarily induce herd immunity until a new dominant strain emerges, causing successive waves of epidemics. As this evolution poses a challenge to herd immunity, broadly neutralizing antibodies and [...] "universal" [...] vaccines that can provide protection beyond a specific serotype are in development.|$|E
