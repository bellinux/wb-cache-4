40|$|Abstract- Sound {{attenuation}} {{is done by}} active <b>sound</b> <b>attenuator</b> or by passive <b>sound</b> <b>attenuator.</b> In case {{of active}} sound attenuation the anti-noise source is used to reduce the intensity of noise however, in passive sound attenuation various types of sound absorbing porous materials are used to absorb sound energy. In passive sound attenuators the {{substantial portion of the}} mechanical pressure wave penetrates to the pores before encountering to the solid surface. Large number of interactions takes place and the energy is transferred to the solid structure through the frictional losses and the sound intensity is reduced. Passive <b>sound</b> <b>attenuator</b> is used in Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) duct to reduce the sound produced by the blower. Two porous materials of different sound absorbing coefficients are used in the attenuator. This passive attenuator is specifically designed to study the effect at low sound frequency. Frequency of sound is measured with the help of Lab VIEW software. Intensity of sound is measured using digital decibel (dB) meter. To measure the pressure drop digital anemometer is used. Along with the combination of porous materials the effect of thickness of porous absorber and the angle of porous absorbers with the direction of air stream is studied...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey is}} given on Alternative Fibreless Absorber ALFA tools and {{materials}} as {{developed over the}} past 20 years by an alliance of Fraunhofer scientists with industrial partners. Twelve fairly different reactive and active sound absorption concepts were thoroughly investigated and successfully brought into the market. A case history describes a completely new type of broadband <b>sound</b> <b>attenuator</b> which seems to confirm A. de Saint-Exupery's statement that "perfection is not completed when nothing more may be added but when no more can be deleted". The philosophy and strategy behind these ongoing innovation processes were displayed in a companion paper in this journal [1]...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increase}} in air travels the last decades the number of airplanes have increased dramatically. The sound generated by the engines have become a significant problem. The last 60 years {{a lot has been}} made trying to reduce the noise levels. Modern jet-engines generates a combination of broadband random noise and tonal components. Acoustic liners are commonly used <b>sound</b> <b>attenuators</b> in jet-engines. Research has shown that acoustic liners can behave both linearly and nonlinearly depending on the sound pressure level. Many studies on the nonlinear effects of acoustic liners have been made and in this report the effect of high level broadband excitation in combination with tonal excitation is evaluated. If nonlinear effect occur it can be of importance for future construction of <b>sound</b> <b>attenuators</b> for jet-engines. The result from this study indicates that at high levels of excitation there is a nonlinear relationship between the random excitation and the tonal excitation. High levels of tonal excitation can increase the level of the random excitation over the full frequency range. For high levels of random excitation the level at the excited tone decreased. Even random excitation at lower frequencies than of the tone can have an effect at the tonal frequency...|$|R
50|$|An air handler, or air {{handling}} unit (often abbreviated to AHU), is a device used to regulate and circulate air {{as part of a}} heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. An air handler is usually a large metal box containing a blower, heating or cooling elements, filter racks or chambers, <b>sound</b> <b>attenuators,</b> and dampers. Air handlers usually connect to a ductwork ventilation system that distributes the conditioned air through the building and returns it to the AHU. Sometimes AHUs discharge (supply) and admit (return) air directly to and from the space served without ductwork.|$|R
40|$|Experiments on the {{interaction}} between a turbulent jet and pure tone sound coming from inside the jet nozzle are reported. This is a model representing the sound transmission from sound sources in jet engines through the nozzle and the jet flow into the far field. It is shown that pure tone sound at low frequencies is considerably attenuated by the jet flow, whereas it is conserved at higher frequencies. On the other hand, broadband jet noise can be amplified considerably by a pure tone excitation. Both effects seem not to be interdependent. Knowledge on how they are created and on relevant parameter dependences allow new considerations {{for the development of}} <b>sound</b> <b>attenuators...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{analytically}} report Coherent Perfect Absorption {{induced by}} the acoustic nonlinear response of a Helmholtz Resonator side loaded to a waveguide. In particular, we show that this two-port acoustic system can perfectly absorb two high amplitude symmetric incident waves when the additive nonlinear losses in the HR, {{induced by the}} jet flow separation, together with the weak linear viscothermal losses of the HR balance the radiation losses to the waveguide. For {{the case of the}} one-sided incidence configuration, this condition leads to an absorption equal to 0. 5. This result, which is verified experimentally, is in a good agreement with an analytical nonlinear model of the impedance of the HR. The nonlinear control of perfect absorption using resonators will open new possibilities in the design of high amplitude <b>sound</b> <b>attenuators</b> for aero-engine applications...|$|R
40|$|Heating, {{ventilating}} and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems {{represent a}} major source of inside buildings noise with a negative effect on the acoustical environment. Therefore, it is necessary to add attenuation to the system. This is provided by <b>sound</b> <b>attenuators</b> or silencers manufactured in different geometrical configurations and with various absorptive lining materials. The paper deals with the insertion loss, as a performance criterion for in-duct noise, of some dissipative silencers types. The measured data are compared in order to establish the efficiency of every tested silencer type. Third-octave band analysis of random noise of an air handling unit (AHU) from a HVAC system is realized without and with silencers (ducts fitted). Insertion loss measurements are made in an anechoic room using a test facility that agrees the requirements of ISO 7235 : 2009. The results highlight the effects of the silencers geometry, pressure-air flow and loading relations upon the sound attenuation level. The silencers selection could be a difficult task for the designers which have to consider all these parameters...|$|R
40|$|In the {{acoustic}} consulting, testing, design and engineering {{work of the}} Fraunhofer-Institute of Building Physics (IBP) the low-frequency end of the noise spectra and the room acoustic conditioning has gained tremendous importance over the years. For solving the long-ranging noise pollution from e. g. exhaust stacks and chimneys, a series of low- frequency <b>sound</b> <b>attenuators</b> with minimum flow resistance were developed. Its first representative was a novel membrane absorber [Ackermann U., et al., Sound absorbers of a novel membrane construction. Applied Acoustics 1998; 25 : 197 - 215]. Thanks to its slenderness and ruggedness {{it could also be}} employed for noise control and reverberation adjustment purposes in relatively narrow enclosures and harsh environments [Ver IL. Enclosures and wrappings. In: Harris C. M., editor. Handbook of acoustical measurements and noise control. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1991; Fuchs H. V., Hunecke J. ] The room plays its part at low frequencies. Das Musikinstrument 1993; 42 : 40 - 6 (in German). Meanwhile a new type of panel absorber has been optimized for both kinds of application. Its absorption efficiency at frequencies far below 100 Hz could be demonstrated and quantified by a special measuring procedure based on the reverberation of a small rectangular room at its eigenfrequencies (Zha X, et al. Measurements of an effective absorption coefficient below 100 Hz. Acoustics Bulletin 1999; 24 : 5 - 10). With the aid of this novel tool it is now possible to qualify reverberation rooms and anechoic chambers for frequencies down to 63 and 31 Hz, respectively (Fuchs HV, et al. Qualifying freefield and reverberation rooms for frequencies below 100 Hz. Applied Acoustics 2000; 59 : 303 - 22). In a companion paper in this same journal [4] [Fuchs H. V., et al. : Creating low-noise environments in communication rooms. Applied Acoustics (in print) ] appropriate experience is reported in creating low-noise environments in multi-purpose rooms like offices, restaurants, foyers and seminars. A number of representative case studies (Drotleff H., et al. : Attractive acoustic design of multi-purpose halls. 1. Chinese-German Platform Innovative Acoustics 2000 (October, 21 - 25. 2000)) show ample evidence that the low-frequency performance of the rooms has a strong influence on both the amplification of intruding external noise and the development of internally generated noise emanating from communication processes provoked by the users themselves. At work places where producing sound (by voices or/and instruments) is the main or only purpose for their existence, {{the acoustic}} qualification of the room at low frequencies turns out to be of the utmost importance, especially when musicians are forced to work in extremely narrow spaces like orchestra pits and rehearsal halls for many hours a day and often under extreme physical and mental pressure. The measures taken and described herein have proven to mitigate if not remove some of the acoustic burden put on musicians employed in states theatres...|$|R
