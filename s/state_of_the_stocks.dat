The assessment of the various stocks is based primarily on the results of the “Groupe de Travail” (GT), held in December 2002 at the Mauritanian fisheries research institute IMROP, Nouadhibou. The conclusions of these assessments are that the octopus stock in the Mauritanian EEZ is overexploited and that fishing effort is about 30 % above the optimum level. Shrimps appear to be exploited near their maximum level. Fishing mortality on hake should be reduced, and the fishing effort in the roundfish fleet should not be further increased...|$|E

This study quantitatively assesses {{the effectiveness of the}} world's 18 RFMOs, based on a two-tiered approach, concentrating first on their performance 'on paper' and secondly, in practice. The former was determined by assessing how well RFMOs scored against 26 criteria that together reflect current RFMO best practices. The latter assessment referenced the current <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> RFMOs manage, through biomass and fishing mortality reference points and biomass trends through time. Results show low performance of RFMOs for both assessments, i. e., average scores of 57 % and 49 %, respectively. The latter result is emphasized by findings that reflect two-thirds of stocks fished on the high seas and under RFMO management are either depleted or overexploited. Findings also indicate that there is no connection between the two sets of scores, suggesting a disparity between organization intent and action.

The main catches are from skipjack and bigeye tuna species, the last one with TAC restrictions. From a strategic perspective it is important to take in account not only the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> and the level of the catches but also the technical characteristics of the fleet and the socioeconomic dimensions of the value chain. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to calculate the technical and scale efficiencies of the tuna fleet, both in cross sectional and longitudinal studies. While the type of boats, the technology, the seasonal production pattern and the fishing areas are similar, there are large differences penalizing the Azores fleet that increases when landings are price valued. The results show the reasons why, that are mainly, for the quantity landings, the scale effect and, for the value landings, the market power of the canning industry. A systemic analysis is then used to integrate different dimensions of the value chain, from the fisheries to the canning industry exports. Since the canned tuna global market is highly concentrated the important local industry press the landings price, so the tuna vessels needs to enlarge its seasonal and spatial production frame to survive...|$|E

40|$|Since 1991, the {{aggregate}} biomass of fish stocks inhabiting the West Greenland shelf stagnates {{at the lowest}} level. The latest survey results of cruise no. 152 conducted by FRV 'Walther Herwig III' do not indicate any improvements in <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks,</b> although no fishing effort was recently directed towards groundfish. The cod stock showed again a record low and is presently dominated by recruits of the year classes 1991 and 1993. Both year classes {{are considered to be}} weak and the cod stock is beyond the 'minimum biologically acceptable level'. Consequently, an increase in stock abundance is not expected either in short or long term. Other ecologically or economically important fish species, American plaice, redfish, wolffish and starry skate, were also found to have minimum stock abundances. By-catch estimates of juvenile groundfish taken by the shrimp fishery, operating at traditional grounds of cod and redfish fisheries, are indispensible. Analysis of climatological data from Nuuk/West Greenland indicates that climate during the past fourty years was characterized by two decades of anomalous warm conditions, and cooling which dominates the dimate since 1969. Anomalous cold events were encountered during 1983, 1984 and during 1992, 1993.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the pattern of}} development of the fisheries in the Antarctic (roughly the area south of the convergence) {{in the light of}} statistics available to FAO. This data series starts with the 1969 / 70 season, but catches were very small before that. Total catches have fluctuated greatly, reflecting several distinct phases in the fishery, initially mainly on fish (Notothenia and Chaenocephalus), but with rapid increases in krill since 1978. Total catches were over half a million t in the 1979 / 80 season. For recent years complete data are available on catches by species and by subarea, but the more detailed data (including statistics of fishing effort) required for stock assessment are not available for some of the biggest fishing countries. As a result, reliable assessments of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> cannot be made, but the historical patterns suggest that the large catches of fish represented the removals of accumulated stocks, and that only a relatively small annual catch can be sustained. No conclusions can be reached from the short period of significant krill catches, although the preliminary reports from the FIBEX surveys suggest that current catches have been only a small proportion of the standing stock. If the fish stocks have indeed been heavily fished, then management measures should be considered. This will require examination of the objectives of the measures (a pattern of "pulse fishing" may be more attractive than a steady but low annual catch), of the arrangements for providing scientific advice, and of the type of measures to be introduced (a limit on the number of vessels operating may be better than attempting to set a Total Allowable Catch) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{second meeting}} of the FAO/CECAF Working Group on the Assessment of Demersal Resources, Subgroup South met in Freetown, Sierra Leone, from 9 to 18 October 2008. The overall {{objective}} of the Working Group is to contribute to improved management of demersal resources in the Southern CECAF area through assessment of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> and fisheries to ensure optimal and sustainable use of the resources {{for the benefit of}} coastal countries. Separate sections have been devoted to each of the following five groups: Demersal Fish South 1, Demersal Fish South 2, Demersal Fish South 3, Shrimps South and Cephalopods South. For each of the sections information is provided on: the fisheries, sampling intensity, biological characteristics, stock identity, trends in data (catch, effort, biological data and abundance indices), assessment, management recommendations and future research. Trends and quality of the basic data (catch, effort and length frequencies) collected by each country, were one the main topics of discussion during the 2008 Working Group meeting. The results of the assessments show that many of the stocks analysed are fully to overexploited, and the working group thus recommended that fishing effort should be reduced for the overexploited stocks to avoid further depletion or not increased for the other stocks. For most of the stocks assessed, the only series of stock abundance indices available were commercial catch per unit effort (CPUE) data series. Commercial CPUE series are affected by changes in fleet size and fishing strategy. Consequently changes observed in the CPUEs do not necessarily reflect the variations in stock abundance. When possible, recommendations on catch levels are also indicated for each stock. Given that most demersal fisheries in the region are multispecific, an overall reduction in fishing effort is necessary...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a management that aims at controlling the removal from <b>the</b> <b>stock,</b> {{guided by a}} perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> derived from limited data that does not allow an ordinary analytic assessment. In simulation modeling, there is a 'real' stock and 'real' removals, and <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> develops according to these removals. The management part creates a feed back loop through a noisy link between <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> true <b>stock</b> and <b>the</b> actual removals. <b>The</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> management {{will depend on how}} the real removal responds to <b>the</b> <b>stock,</b> and how <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> responds to <b>the</b> removals.

40|$|Fishermen {{experience}} {{variation in}} their daily catches that they cannot explain from their knowledge and experience. This uncertainty in daily catch rate {{is important in the}} life of fishermen and should be seen as a main characteristic of a fishery. This study tries to decrease the gap in knowledge on this subject by (1) characterising uncertainty in daily catch rate, (2) analysing the sources of this uncertainty and (3) outlining the consequences of uncertainty for the organisation of the fishery and its management. The purse-seine and liftnet fisheries on small pelagic fish in the coastal waters around Ambon and the Lease Islands (Central Moluccas, Indonesia) are used in this study, because they are among the most uncertain fisheries in the world on a daily basis. Daily catches range from 0 to 25 times the average catch (coefficient of variation > 3) and a large proportion of this variability cannot be accounted for. The large uncertainty in catch rates of individual fishing units derives from the relationship between the loosely structured pelagic environment in which the fisheries operate and the small scale of operation of these fisheries. The multispecies character of the fisheries reduces the uncertainty in total catch relative to that of catches of individual species. However, the developments in the total catch have little indicative value for the catch rates of individual species. The uncertainty in catch rates may be further increased by comparison or combination of catch data from different fishing units with different technical characteristics, if effects of these on the catchability are not accounted for. Therefore, the use of non-standardised catch per unit of effort as an indication of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> is questionable. The consequence of this high uncertainty is that individual fishermen are hardly able to perceive spatial and temporal patterns in fish distribution and thus cannot optimise the outcome of their fishery through spatial allocation of effort. This results in risk-aversive behaviour, i. e. concentrated effort near the homeport. These effort concentrations may lead to local overfishing, which, in turn, reduce the accuracy of the perception of the status of the stocks by individual fishermen and local authorities even further. The inaccurate perception limits the role of both groups in fisheries management aiming at sustainable exploitation of the stocks. The high level of uncertainty in combination with the low monetary outcome shapes the livelihood of individual crewmembers, because they need additional income to feed their families. The resulting dependency on other sources of income in combination with the uncertainty has a substantial impact on the organisation of the fishery. Hence we conclude that both the local organisation of the fisheries and the perception of individual fishermen and local authorities should be integrated into fishery management plans in order to be successful...|$|E

Current catch statistics compiled by ICCAT seem accurate, but historic catches may have been at least partially under-reported. In this paper we investigate the effect that different historic patterns of under-reporting have in the assessment. We do this by fitting biomass dynamic models to simulated data where under-reporting is random and linearly decreasing. Current assessments are robust if under-reporting has not exceeded 20 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total historic catch. Greater levels of underreporting will create pessimistic views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> but optimistic views about its future productivity. It is unknown if management could still reach its objectives in such situations. We recommend that attempts are made to quantify if the historic under-reporting is likely to have exceeded 20 %...|$|R
