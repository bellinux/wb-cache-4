50|$|By the age {{of three}} months, the {{previously}} feathered head is now completely bald and the dull bill has become warm yellow with a greenish yellow tip. Both features are characteristic of adults. Milky stork juveniles appear almost identical to <b>painted</b> <b>stork</b> juveniles, but are said to be distinguishable from <b>painted</b> <b>stork</b> juveniles by their paler underwing lining contrasting with the completely black flight feathers, whereas this underwing lining is completely black in <b>painted</b> <b>storks.</b>|$|R

50|$|Particularly for captive individuals, {{there is}} {{the risk of a}} loss of genetic {{integrity}} through hybridization with <b>painted</b> <b>storks</b> in captivity or in the wild in the northern parts of the milky stork range where it may co-occur with the <b>painted</b> <b>stork.</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{are some}} {{concerns}} for the closely related milky stork owing to hybridization with the <b>painted</b> <b>stork,</b> particularly in zoos.

50|$|The {{milky stork}} was {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} Ibis genus, with the binomial name Ibis cinereus, but is now categorised as belonging to Mycteria due to large similarities in appearance and behaviour to the three other storks in this genus (the wood stork, yellow-billed <b>stork</b> and <b>painted</b> <b>stork).</b> Phylogenetic studies based on DNA hybridization and cytochrome oxidase b have demonstrated that the milky stork shares a clade with other Mycteria, and forms a sister pair of species with the <b>painted</b> <b>stork.</b>|$|R
