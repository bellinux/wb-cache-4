5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White {{is to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was not <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E

The poverty and misery arising from a too rapid increase of population had been distinctly seen, and the most violent remedies proposed, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> as the times of Plato and Aristotle. And of late years the subject has been treated in such a manner by some of the French Economists; occasionally by Montesquieu, and, among our own writers, by Dr. Franklin, Sir James Stewart, Mr. Arthur Young, and Mr. Townsend, as to create a natural surprise that it had not excited more of the public attention.|$|E

25|$|The Atlantic {{coast of}} the United States is low, with minor exceptions. The Appalachian Highland owes its oblique northeast-southwest trend to crustal {{deformations}} which in very early geological time gave a beginning to what later came to be the Appalachian mountain system. This system had its climax of deformation <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> (probably in Permian time) that it has since then been very generally reduced to moderate or low relief. It owes its present-day altitude either to renewed elevations along the earlier lines or {{to the survival of}} the most resistant rocks as residual mountains. The oblique trend of this coast would be even more pronounced but for a comparatively modern crustal movement, causing a depression in the northeast resulting in an encroachment of the sea upon the land. Additionally, the southeastern section has undergone an elevation resulting in the advance of the land upon the sea.|$|E
25|$|Some {{years later}} in St. Louis McKeag runs into Lise and her daughter, who is now nearly grown. He reveals to Lise that Clay Basket is the same woman McKeag had told Lise he loved, decades earlier at Lise & Pasquinel's wedding. The townswoman convinces McKeag to confront Pasquinel about this fact, {{since it is the}} reason their friendship-partnership split <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago.</b> McKeag follows Lise's advice, and goes looking for Pasquinel to tell him of his love for Clay Basket. The {{brothers}} Marcel and Jacques have left on their own, while Pasquinel has taken Clay Basket and his newest daughter Lucinda (Cristina Raines) up into the mountains. In a valley on a small creek, the aged Pasquinel finally finds Lame Beaver's original vein of gold. He joyously plucks gold out of the water, having at last found what he has sought half his life. It is at this moment that McKeag arrives, as do Pawnee braves. The Pawnee shoot Pasquinel with multiple arrows and kill him. The heartbroken Clay Basket and McKeag can only watch, and then hold the dying voyageur in their arms.|$|E

500|$|Between 1977 and 1989 Home was Governor of I Zingari, the nomadic cricket team. In {{retirement}} {{he published}} three books: [...] The Way The Wind Blows (1976), described by Hurd as [...] "a good-natured autobiography, with perhaps more anecdotes than insights", Border Reflections (1979), and his correspondence with his grandson Matthew Darby, Letters to a Grandson (1983). In the 1980s Home increasingly {{spent his time}} in Scotland, with his family. He was a keen fisherman and enjoyed shooting. Hurd writes that [...] "there was no sudden moment when he abandoned politics", rather that [...] "his interventions became fewer and fewer". His last speech in the House of Lords was in 1989, when he spoke against Hurd's proposals for prosecuting war criminals living in Britain: [...] "After such a lapse of time justice might not {{be seen to be}} done. It would be dangerous to rely on memories of events that occurred <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago.</b> It was too late to reopen the issue." [...] His withdrawal from public affairs became more marked {{after the death of his}} wife in 1990, after 54 years of marriage.|$|E
500|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of state courts accept {{that there must be}} a duty of care for there to be liability: the courts of Wisconsin, though, have stated that they have adopted Andrews' approach, and impose liability when there was a duty to any person, whether or not that person is the plaintiff. The Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965) amended the earlier formulation only slightly, but the third Restatement (2009), takes an approach closer to that of Andrews in focusing on whether the defendant engaged in an activity that carried a risk of harm to another (not necessarily the plaintiff), and on whether the defendant exercised reasonable care. The new formulation makes foreseeability, or the scope of the risk, not a hurdle that must be overcome, as in Palsgraf, but a factor to be weighed with others when determining whether there was negligence. Thus, according to law professor David Owen in his 2009 article, [...] "the Restatement (Third) discards Judge Cardozo's elemental work in Palsgraf <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago.</b> And... also rejects Judge Andrew's [...] valuable insight that juries should be offered a wide range of fairness factors, beginning with foreseeability, in figuring how far responsibility should extend".|$|E

500|$|On 17 June 1947, {{serialisation}} of {{the story}} paused after Hergé disappeared. Doctors diagnosed him as suffering from a mental breakdown {{as a result of}} overwork, and to recover he spent time in retreat at the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de-Scourmont. In a letter to his wife Germaine, Hergé wrote, [...] "Life has spoilt me... I no longer draw like I breathe, as I used to not <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago.</b> Tintin is no longer me... my Boy Scout spirit has been badly damaged." [...] He followed this with a holiday to Gland on Lake Geneva, Switzerland with Germaine. Editors of Tintin magazine posted a sarcastic notice in the magazine stating that [...] "Our friend Hergé is in need of a rest. Oh, don't worry, he's fine. But in refusing to marshal his forces to bring you a new episode of The Temple of the Sun each week, our friend is a little over-worked." [...] He disappeared again in early 1948, this time for six weeks, again to Gland, but according to biographer Pierre Assouline he was accompanied by a young, married woman, with whom he was having an extra-marital affair. Angered by his absence, the editorial board decided to command other artists and writers to continue the story, a threat which made Hergé return to work.|$|E
500|$|The {{performers}} {{category is}} meant for recording artists and bands that have [...] "influence and {{significance to the}} development and perpetuation of rock and roll." [...] Artists become eligible for induction in that category 25 years {{after the release of}} their first record. In order to be inducted, an artist must be nominated by a committee that selects anywhere from nine to a dozen candidates. Ballots are sent to 600 [...] "rock experts" [...] who then evaluate the candidates and vote on who should be inducted. The performers who receive the highest number of votes and more than 50 percent of the vote are inducted. In 2011, the number inducted was five. The rest of the categories are voted on by special committees. In 2012, six additional bands and groups were inducted as performers by a special committee, due to the controversial nature of their band being excluded when their lead singer was inducted. [...] "There was a lot of discussion about this," [...] said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. [...] "There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question – it was <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago...</b> We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result." ...|$|E
500|$|Server Sundaram {{attained}} cult {{status in}} Tamil cinema, and is believed by many critics to be Nagesh's breakthrough {{role as an}} actor and Balachander's first success in Tamil cinema. Actor Kamal Haasan compared his 2015 film Uttama Villain (which also starred Balachander) to Server Sundaram, finding it to be [...] "both emotional and humorous" [...] like the latter. The success of Server Sundaram led to many collaborations between Nagesh and Balachander, notable of which include Neerkumizhi (1965), Major Chandrakanth (1966), Ethir Neechal (1968) and Apoorva Raagangal (1975). Film historian Mohan V. Raman noted, [...] "By casting [...] in Server Sundaram, ... made the comedian a serious actor." [...] The film also became noted for introducing the anti-hero to Tamil cinema {{as well as the}} style of delivering short and fast-paced dialogues. A dialogue spoken by Nagesh's character, [...] "Long, long ago... <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago,</b> nobody knows how long ago" [...] became popular. Balachander mentions the dialogue in Uttama Villain as a build-up to the film his character directs. Actor Appukutty worked in several hotels and restaurants as a cleaner and server before making his debut as the lead actor with Azhagarsamiyin Kuthirai (2011) which won him the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor; Kumar Chellappan of Daily News and Analysis compared this to the plot of Server Sundaram. Bharatiya Janata Party member L. Ganesan considered Server Sundaram to be an example [...] "of good Tamil cinema globally." [...] Following Nagesh's death in 2009, Sify ranked Server Sundaram fourth in its list, [...] "10 Best Films of late Nagesh", commenting, [...] "A hotel waiter becomes a superstar and the transformation is shown brilliantly by the actor." [...] Sri Lankan historian Sachi Sri Kantha included Server Sundaram in his list compiling [...] "the ten landmark Tamil movies, spanning all genres, which delighted the multitude of fans immensely". The sequence where Sundaram balances several vessels in one hand, referred to by the Hindustan Times Gautaman Bhaskaran as the [...] "dumara-tumbler" [...] sequence, attained popularity, as did the scene where Sundaram's mother realises that he is not a hotel manager but a waiter.|$|E
