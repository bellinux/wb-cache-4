5|$|Barcelona {{qualified}} for the group stage as runners-up to Atlético in the previous season's La Liga. They were the top <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> Group F, alongside – in order – Paris Saint-Germain (winners of the 2013–14 Ligue 1), Ajax (winners of the 2013–14 Eredivisie) and APOEL (winners of the 2013–14 Cypriot First Division).|$|E
5|$|Based on its size, the {{morphology}} of its molars, and microwear {{analysis on}} its teeth, Babakotia radofilai was likely a folivore, while supplementing its diet with fruit and hard <b>seeds.</b> <b>In</b> all sloth lemurs, including Babakotia radofilai, the permanent teeth erupted early, a trait seen in indriids that improves survivability of juveniles {{during the first}} dry season following weaning.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{there has}} been {{research}} suggesting that the common raven is involved in seed dispersal. In the wild, the common raven chooses the best habitat and disperses <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> locations best suited for its survival.|$|E
50|$|The <b>seeding</b> <b>in</b> the {{preliminary}} round {{is based on}} the 2015 World Championships. The teams were grouped according to <b>seeding</b> (<b>in</b> parenthesis is the corresponding 2015 placement). Top 8 placement was <b>seeded</b> <b>in</b> Level 1.|$|R
5000|$|They won a {{total of}} 10 tournament games against six {{different}} teams {{ranked in the top}} 20. ESPN pointed out that in terms of the NCAA basketball tournament, Fresno State's run would be equivalent to a 13 seed beating a 4 <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the first round, a 5 <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the second round, a top <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the Sweet 16, a second <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the Elite 8, another top <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the Final Four, and still another 2 seed for the championship.|$|R
50|$|Gonzaga {{received}} a 7 <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament, and were paired against the 10 seed Davidson College, a sleeper pick by many experts. During the season the Bulldogs played ten teams that eventually {{made it to}} the tournament, and played a total of 13 games against teams who made it into the tournament. The Zags won seven of those thirteen games beating a 10 <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> Saint Mary's, a 13 <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> San Diego (Gonzaga won twice against San Diego), an 11 <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> Saint Joseph's, WKU, a 12 seed, a 14th seeded Georgia team, and a 4 <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> UConn. Gonzaga also lost six games against eventual tournament teams, they lost to Saint Mary's on the road, San Diego in the WCC Conference tournament, and also lost to a 1 <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> Memphis, a 2 <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> Tennessee, a 6th seeded Oklahoma Sooners team, and a 4 <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> Washington State at home.|$|R
5|$|In South Africa, ants {{are used}} to help harvest rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which are small seeds {{used to make a}} herbal tea. The plant disperses its seeds widely, making manual {{collection}} difficult. Black ants collect and store these and other <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> their nest, where humans can gather them en masse. Up to half a pound (200g) of seeds may be collected from one ant-heap.|$|E
5|$|M.pithecoides {{from the}} central plateau was a {{specialized}} leaf-eater (folivore), but the other two species had a more mixed diet, eating fruits and <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> addition to leaves. The level of seed predation varies between the three species, with tooth wear indicating that M.dolichobrachion exhibited the greatest level of seed predation within the genus.|$|E
5|$|Multiple-tube {{seed drill}}: The wooden seed drill existed in China by the 3rd century BC, while the multiple-tube iron seed drill was first invented in China by the 2nd century BC, during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). The seed drill allowed for greater speed and {{regulation}} of distributing <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> lined rows of crops instead of casting them {{out onto the}} farm field.|$|E

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{begins its}} breeding season {{later in the}} year than any other finch and later than any other native North American bird, besides occasionally the sedge wren. This {{may be related to the}} abundance of <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> the late summer months, as seeds represent the majority of their diet.|$|E
5|$|The seed theory became {{influential}} in the literary circles of North Korea and writers sought to backtrack the <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> classics preceding Kim's treatise. In addition to questions of art, the seed theory was adopted to {{a wider range of}} industrial and economic activities.|$|E
5|$|The winter diet {{is mainly}} plant {{material}} including seeds and rhizomes of aquatic plants, but the pintail sometimes feeds on roots, grain and other <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> fields, though less frequently than other Anas ducks. During the nesting season, this bird eats mainly invertebrate animals, including aquatic insects, molluscs and crustaceans.|$|E

5|$|When {{there is}} more pollen applied to the stigma, more seeds are {{produced}} in the fruits and the fruits are larger with greater likelihood of maturation, an effect called xenia. Competitively grown specimens are therefore often hand-pollinated to maximize the number of <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> the fruit, which increases the fruit size; this pollination requires skilled technique. Seedlessness is known to occur in certain cultivars of C.pepo.|$|E
5|$|All nuthatches {{appear to}} store food, {{especially}} <b>seeds,</b> <b>in</b> tree crevices, in the ground, under small stones, or behind bark flakes, and these caches are remembered {{for as long}} as 30 days. Similarly, the rock nuthatches wedge snails into suitable crevices for consumption in times of need. European nuthatches have been found to avoid using their caches during benign conditions in order to save them for harsher times.|$|E
5|$|An English trader, Charles Ledger, and his Amerindian servant {{spent four}} years {{collecting}} cinchona <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> the Andes in Bolivia, highly prized for their quinine but whose export was prohibited. Ledger managed to get seeds out; in 1865, the Dutch government cultivated 20,000 trees of the Cinchona ledgeriana in Java (Indonesia). By {{the end of the}} nineteenth century, the Dutch had established a world monopoly over its supply.|$|E
50|$|The eight {{teams were}} drawn {{into two groups}} of four teams. Tournament host Grenada were <b>seeded</b> <b>in</b> Group A, while {{defending}} CONCACAF Women's U-17 Championship champion Mexico were <b>seeded</b> <b>in</b> Group B.|$|R
50|$|The Alabama {{team was}} a six <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the Midwest region. After beating the 11 seed Oregon State, they faced a higher seed, Iowa, who were <b>seeded</b> third <b>in</b> the region. Alabama won that game, {{and went on}} to face another higher <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> Texas Tech, the {{defending}} national champions. Alabama won again, {{and went on to}} face Penn State, the top <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the region. Alabama won yet again, this time by 14 points, to advance to their first final Four.|$|R

5|$|As for tournaments {{where only}} one of the Big Four has competed, this is the only {{category}} where {{the rest of the field}} has a positive ratio, winning 186 of the 262 tournaments (71%) played overall. However, it must be noted that this includes many tournaments played early on in each of the Big Four's careers when they were still unseeded or seeded in double digits. Since their debut as the Top 4 <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> late 2008, the Big Four have won 31 of the 60 tournaments (52%) where just one of them has competed.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various <b>seeds.</b> <b>In</b> the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E
5|$|Predominantly insectivorous, the {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} berries and <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> winter. It builds its nests in thick shrubs and the closeness of its nesting sites to the ground make it a favored species {{for the study of}} warbler behavior in the wild. The black-throated blue warbler defends its territory against other birds of the same species for both nesting and winter habitats. As the black-throated blue warbler requires large, unbroken forest areas for nesting, its numbers are declining.|$|E
50|$|The eight {{teams were}} drawn {{into two groups}} of four teams. Tournament host and {{defending}} CONCACAF Futsal Championship champion Costa Rica were <b>seeded</b> <b>in</b> Group B, while 2012 runner-up Guatemala were <b>seeded</b> <b>in</b> Group A.|$|R
30|$|These were {{consistent}} with the composition of the soil <b>seed</b> bank. <b>In</b> soil <b>seed</b> bank, A. scoparia had the biggest density of 6 888.7 seed m- 2, which could take approximately 84.8 % of the total <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> the soil <b>seed</b> bank. A. gmelinii with lower density of approximately 297.5 seed m- 2 accounted for 2 % of the total <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> soil <b>seed</b> bank, and A. giraldii with density of approximately 103.3 seed m- 2 only accounted for 0.7 % of the total <b>seed</b> <b>in</b> soil <b>seed</b> bank [26].|$|R

5|$|Seed {{release in}} B.prionotes is {{promoted}} by repeated wetting of the cones. The seed separator {{that holds the}} <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> place is hygroscopic; its two wings pull together then wet, then spread and curl inwards as it dries out again. In doing so, it functions as a lever, gradually prying seeds out of a follicle {{over the course of}} a wet-dry cycle. This adaptation ensures that seed release following fire is delayed until the onset of rain, when germination and seedling survival rates are higher.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies of}} the house sparrow in {{temperate}} agricultural areas have found the proportion of <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> its diet to be about 90%. It will eat almost any seeds, but where it has a choice, it prefers oats and wheat. In urban areas, the house sparrow feeds largely on food provided directly or indirectly by humans, such as bread, though it prefers raw seeds. The house sparrow also eats some plant matter besides seeds, including buds, berries, and fruits such as grapes and cherries. In temperate areas, the house sparrow has an unusual habit of tearing flowers, especially yellow ones, in the spring.|$|E
5|$|The {{fieldfare}} (Turdus pilaris) is {{a member}} of the thrush family Turdidae. It breeds in woodland and scrub in northern Europe and Asia. It is strongly migratory, with many northern birds moving south during the winter. It is a very rare breeder in the British Isles, but winters in large numbers in the United Kingdom, Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of molluscs, insects and earthworms in the summer, and berries, grain and <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> the winter.|$|E
