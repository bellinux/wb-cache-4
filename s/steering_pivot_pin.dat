40|$|Abstract [...] Gearboxes {{are used}} in almost every {{industry}} right from power to marine, and also include agriculture, textile, automobiles, aerospace, shipping etc. A gearbox is a gear or a hydraulic system responsible for transmitting mechanical power from a prime mover (an engine or electric motor) into some form of useful output. It is referred to the metal casing in which a number of gears are sealed. <b>Pivot</b> <b>pin</b> fitted in lever of gearbox which is used for engaging the gears in gearbox. It is seen that the component <b>Pivot</b> <b>Pin</b> has failed in few Vehicles after completion of certain Kms. In the proposed work, design of <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> of gearbox is studied {{and with the help}} of design, the component studied in detail on this particular failure and by considering different manufacturing processes, suitable results will be calculated. Later on, design modifications are done on <b>Pivot</b> <b>pin.</b> This technical paper is on failure diagnosis and modification in design of <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> gearbox used in vehicle. ANSYS is used for stress analysis. The main objective for carrying out this analysis was to improve the life of the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin.</b> After the analysis of <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> from existing gearbox the reason for failure was found. The reason for failure of the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> was due to fatigue failure. This is caused due to Breaking of all the Pins is in the same manner at the same cross section near the Relief Groove. To relieve these stress concentration modifications in the design of <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> were done and after that again stress analysis of the modified <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> carried out.

50|$|A center <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> {{is bolted}} to the body bolster. The center <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> runs down {{vertically}} {{through the center of}} the bogie bolster through the center pivot. It allows for rotation of the bogie when the coach is moving on the curves. A silent block, which is cylindrical metal rubber bonded structure, is placed in the central hole of the bogie bolster through which the center <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> passes. It provides the cushioning effect.|$|R
50|$|The bogies {{consist of}} the two lateral main beams, and the two cross beams at each end; there is no middle welded cross beam. The {{transfer}} of pulling and braking power from bogie to locomotive takes place via two rods, which connect the locomotive via <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> to the bogie. The <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> are mounted with a slight slant to enable {{the formation of a}} right angle to the also slightly slanted rods. The rods are spring mounted at about 40 mm to the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin,</b> so that the movement of the bogie could be balanced.|$|R
50|$|A razor is well {{balanced}} if when {{opened it}} balances about its <b>pivot</b> <b>pin,</b> {{indicating that the}} torques about the pivot point, caused by the corresponding weight distributions of the blade and the handle about the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin,</b> counterbalance each other. A well-balanced razor is both safer to handle when open and easier to shave with.|$|R
50|$|The {{expander}} system {{consists of}} patented {{products that are}} intended {{to take the place}} of conventional <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> in heavy machinery and equipment. Conventional <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> may wear in a way that requires a costly repair process for pivot lug holes, called line boring. The expander system uses expansion sleeves that can eliminate this wear problem.|$|R

50|$|MacPherson {{originally}} {{created the}} design for use at all four wheels, {{but it is more}} commonly used for the front suspension only, where it provides a <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> as well as a suspension mounting for the wheel.|$|R
5000|$|... 1976 models had {{the front}} brake caliper {{moved to the}} right fork leg, behind the fork as opposed to {{in front of the}} fork. This placed the brake caliper nearer the <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> center-line, {{requiring}} slightly less effort to steer.|$|R
50|$|There were early {{reports of}} {{problems}} with the Steyr Scout rifle relating to breakage of the bipod <b>pivot</b> <b>pin.</b> The affected part was subsequently redesigned to improve its strength. Some shooters complained that the bipod was too tall.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{approximation}} {{to perfect}} Ackermann steering geometry may be generated {{by moving the}} <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> points inward so as to lie on a line drawn between the steering kingpins and {{the centre of the}} rear axle. The <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> points are joined by a rigid bar called the tie rod which can also be part of the steering mechanism, {{in the form of a}} rack and pinion for instance. With perfect Ackermann, at any angle of steering, the centre point of all of the circles traced by all wheels will lie at a common point. Note that this may be difficult to arrange in practice with simple linkages, and designers are advised to draw or analyse their steering systems over the full range of steering angles.|$|R
50|$|The current Opinel knife {{consists}} of a blade, wooden handle, stainless steel metal clamping band, stainless <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> (axle), and (except {{in the case of}} the smaller models) a stainless steel Virobloc locking collar, which locks the blade open or closed.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a rolling}} block action the {{breechblock}} {{takes the form of}} a part-cylinder, with a <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> through its axis. The operator rotates or [...] "rolls" [...] the block to open and close the breech; it is a simple, rugged and reliable design. Rolling blocks are most often associated with firearms made by Remington in the later 19th century; in the Remington action the hammer serves to lock the breech closed at the moment of firing, and the block in turn prevents the hammer from falling with the breech open. An interesting variation of the rolling block was the Austrian M1867 Werndl-Holub, in which the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> was parallel to the barrel and the block rotated sideways.|$|R
30|$|Bogie <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> Transfers {{tractive}} effort (longitudinal) and cornering (lateral) {{forces from the}} bogie to the car-body. These are modelled with two nonlinear springs constrained {{to move in the}} longitudinal and lateral directions, respectively, with 4  mm of travel (±  2  mm from centre).|$|R
50|$|Sandwich {{constructed}} balisong knives are {{assembled in}} layers that are generally pinned or screwed together though may sometimes use a ball-bearing system. They allow the <b>pivot</b> <b>pins</b> {{to be adjusted}} more tightly without binding. When the knife is closed, the blade rests between the layers.|$|R
50|$|The MacPherson strut {{is a type}} of {{automotive}} suspension system that uses the top of a telescopic damper as the upper <b>steering</b> <b>pivot.</b> It is widely used in the front suspension of modern vehicles and is named for American automotive engineer Earle S.

40|$|MOUDRÝ Michal: Forging {{production}} of holder of <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> The project was elaborated in frame of engineering studies branch 2307. The {{aim of the}} project was to propose design of technology {{production of}} <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> holder using solid forming of steel 12 040. 0. Based on literary study on die forging and made calculations forging on a vertical crank press LMZ 1000 with nominal forging force of 10 MN was designed (producer ŠMERAL Brno). Lower and upper ejectors are used for ejection of components. Induction furnace type SOP 250 / 6 -A 30 P/L/T will be used for heating of the raw material. Trimming will be performed using trimming press LDO 315 A/S with press force of 3, 15 MN. Dies are made of instrumental steel 19 663. 9, for their clamping die clamping device QLZK 1000 /UC will be used.

50|$|The tow-ball {{is popular}} for lighter loads, readily {{allowing}} swivelling and articulation of a trailer. A tow pin and jaw with a trailer loop {{are often used}} for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> allows the same movements. A pintle and lunette is a very heavy duty hitching combination used in construction and the military.|$|R
50|$|A {{basin wrench}} {{consists}} of a long shaft {{with a pair of}} asymmetrical jaws at one end and a transverse handle at the other end. The two jaws form an assembly in which the jaws are joined with a <b>pivot</b> <b>pin.</b> One of the jaws is fixed relative to the shaft, and the other is curved and spring-loaded relative to the fixed jaw so that it will automatically close and grip the fastener. When the shaft is turned in the direction that causes the curved jaw to trail the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin,</b> the jaws will increase their grip on the fastener as shaft torque increases, thereby allowing the operator to apply torque to the fastener without slippage. The transverse handle passes through a loosely fitting hole in the shaft {{so that it can be}} shifted to conform to tight spaces or to elongate it so as to increase leverage.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} wear on {{a roller chain}} is to {{increase}} the pitch (spacing of the links), causing the chain to grow longer. Note that this is due to wear at the <b>pivoting</b> <b>pins</b> and bushes, not from actual stretching of the metal (as does happen to some flexible steel components such as the hand-brake cable of a motor vehicle).|$|R
5000|$|This {{design was}} {{built around the}} Blackhawk, but it takes its styling cues from the Remington Model 1858 cap and ball pistol. This {{is due to the}} frame being longer in front to {{accommodate}} the loading lever and <b>pivot</b> <b>pin.</b> Earlier models listed as [...]44 caliber, later as [...]45, but all use a [...]457” round balls or [...]454” conical bullets of pure lead.|$|R
50|$|Hub-center {{steering}} (HCS) is one {{of several}} different types of front end suspension/steering mechanisms used in motorcycles and cargo bicycles. Hub-center steering is characterized by the <b>steering</b> <b>pivot</b> points being inside the hub of the wheel, rather than above the wheel in the headstock as in the traditional layout. Most hub-center arrangements employ a swingarm that extends {{from the bottom of the}} engine/frame to the centre of the front wheel.|$|R

50|$|The sweep {{itself was}} a long, tapered pole of about twenty-foot length. Six feet of the length at the small end {{projected}} across the <b>pivoting</b> <b>pin</b> onto the deck. The larger end lay out over the water. To the water end had been attached a broad wooden blade nearly ten feet long. To swing the heavy sweep and guide the cumbersome ark required the strength of two men {{at each of the}} sweep handles.|$|R
50|$|The {{trainsets}} are 4-unit {{multiple units}} capable of operating in pairs, designed for medium-distance high-speed services. The inner axle of each carriage bogie {{is powered by}} a body mounted three phase asynchronous traction motor via a cardan shaft final drive. The electrical power is regulated by IGBT devices with one converted per carriage. The bogies are of welded steel construction with primary coil springs and secondary air suspension. Tractive forces are transmitted by a drag <b>pivot</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Quoted {{directly}} from the Snakeboard patent Abstract and Claims: [...] "This invention relates to a skateboard comprising two footboards each of the footboards including a foot platform and wheel-set which carries two wheels in axial alignment fixed to {{the underside of the}} platform, a spacer element for holding the footboards in a spaced relationship and a pivot arrangement having a vertical pivot axis connecting each footboard to the spacer element to enable both footboards to pivot relatively to the spacer element, each wheel set including a wheel body, wheel axles which are fixed to and project from the opposite sides of the body with the wheels being journaled for rotation on the axles, a first <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> being attached to the wheel body with its axis in a vertical direction, a support member on the wheel body, a second <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> pivotally connecting the foot platform to the support member with its pivot axis normal to the wheel axis, and resilient suspension means between the support member and the underside of the foot platform for holding the platform horizontal, said pivot arrangement being pivotally engaged with the first pivot pin." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{tow hitch}} (or tow bar) is a device {{attached}} to the chassis of a vehicle for towing, or a towbar to an aircraft nose gear. It can {{take the form of}} a tow ball to allow swiveling and articulation of a trailer, or a tow pin, or a tow hook with a trailer loop, often used for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> allows similar movements. Another category is the towing pintle used on military vehicles worldwide.|$|R
5000|$|Indicator needle axle. This has a {{spur gear}} that engages the sector gear (7) and extends through the face to drive the {{indicator}} needle. Due to the short distance between the lever arm link boss and the <b>pivot</b> <b>pin</b> {{and the difference between}} the effective radius of the sector gear and that of the spur gear, any motion of the Bourdon tube is greatly amplified. A small motion of the tube results in a large motion of the indicator needle.|$|R
50|$|As {{all other}} types of the Einheitslokomotiven program, the class E 10 / class 110 had 2-axle pivoted bogies/trucks as welded box {{construction}} with <b>pivot</b> <b>pins,</b> and welded superstructure with fan grills. The class 110.3 used {{the body of the}} E 10.12 with the pulled-forward frontal area, also called the “crease” (Bügelfalte). The frame is propped up over the bogies by coil springs and rubber elements. Originally a bumpy ride at higher speeds was noticeable, which required repeated rework of the bogies. In two locomotives (110 475 and 476) a flexicoil suspension was tested.|$|R
50|$|On {{the hollow}} shafts {{there are two}} {{ventilated}} disc brakes, {{for which there is}} enough room due to the missing cross beam and <b>pivot</b> <b>pin,</b> as mentioned above. The disc brakes are separate and are ventilated from the inside. They can be serviced or replaced from below, without needing to take out the entire axle. During regular braking, primarily the regenerative brake is used, and the traction motor serves as the generator. The cooperation between disc brakes and regenerative brakes is controlled by a dedicated brake control computer.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{locomotive}} has two {{electrical converter}} units with three IGBT based, water cooled output inverters per converter. Two of the inverters power the traction motors; the third unit supplies head-end and auxiliary power. The HEP/auxiliary inverters are dual-redundant and identical (rated [...] ), allowing the locomotive {{to remain in}} service should one inverter fail en route. The locomotive bogies are fabricated steel designs, with low-lying traction links and center <b>pivot</b> <b>pin.</b> The traction motors are frame-mounted, with torque transmitted via a hollow shaft drive. Locomotive braking is facilitated by cheek mounted disc brakes on each wheel.|$|R
