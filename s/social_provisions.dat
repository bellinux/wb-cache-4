2500|$|These {{structural}} problems result in worse healthcare and therefore worse health outcomes for impoverished populations. Health care costs can pose absolutely serious threats to impoverished populations, especially in countries without proper <b>social</b> <b>provisions.</b> According to US HHS, [...] "In 2009, children 6–17 {{years of age}} {{were more likely to}} be uninsured than younger children, and children with a family income below 200% of the poverty level {{were more likely to be}} uninsured than children in higher-income families." [...] In elderly populations, individuals below 400% of the poverty line were between 3 and 5 times more likely to lack insurance. Children below 200% of the poverty line were also less likely to have insurance than wealthier families. Also, in 2009 in the US, 20% of adults (ages 18–64) below 200% of the poverty line did not receive their necessary drugs because of cost, compared to only 4% of those above 400% of the poverty line. This can be seen in other nations, where in Asia, payments for healthcare pushed almost 3% of the population of 11 countries below 1 US$ per day.|$|E
2500|$|The Treaty of Maastricht 1992 {{renamed the}} EEC as the [...] "European Union", and {{expanded}} its powers {{to include a}} social chapter, set up a European Exchange Rate Mechanism, and limit government spending. The UK initially opted out of the <b>social</b> <b>provisions,</b> and then monetary union after the Black Wednesday crisis where speculators bet against the pound. Sweden, Finland and Austria joined in 1995, but Norway again chose not to after a 1994 referendum, instead remaining part of the European Economic Area, abiding by most EU law, but without any voting rights. At the Treaty of Amsterdam 1997, with a new Labour government, the UK joined the social chapter. A newly confident EU then sought to expand. First, the Treaty of Nice 2001 made voting weight more proportionate to population (two Irish referenda rejected, but then accepted this). Second, the Euro currency went into circulation in 2002. Third came the accession of Malta, Cyprus, Slovenia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. Fourth, in 2005 a Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was proposed. This [...] "Constitution" [...] was largely symbolic, but was rejected by referenda in France and the Netherlands. Most of its technical provisions were inserted into the Treaty of Lisbon 2007, without the emotive symbols of federalism or the word [...] "constitution". Also in 2007, Bulgaria and Romania joined. Over 2007 to 2008, because of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, and the developing global financial crisis European banks that had invested in derivatives were put under severe pressure. British, French, German and other governments were forced to nationalise or guarantee their banks' debts. In turn, the Eurozone crisis developed when international investment withdrew and Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland saw international bond markets charge unsustainably high interest rates on government debt. Eurozone governments and staff of the European Central Bank {{believed that it was}} necessary to save their banks by taking over Greek debt, and impose [...] "austerity" [...] and [...] "structural adjustment" [...] measures on debtor countries. This exacerbated further contraction in the economies. In 2011 two new treaties, the European Fiscal Compact and European Stability Mechanism were signed among Eurozone countries. In 2013, Croatia entered the EU. However a further crisis was triggered after the UK's Conservative government chose to hold a referendum in 2016, and campaigners for [...] "leave" [...] won 51.89 per cent of votes.|$|E

Three months after the first-year students participated in the program, they were asked to answer their states of school adjustment including their satisfactions of their school life, anxieties of their study, personal growth, utilization of the FC, and other variables. In addition to these, the Japanese version of the <b>Social</b> <b>Provision</b> Scale was tested for future administration, since it has been widely used {{all over the world and}} the development of <b>social</b> <b>provision</b> was reported through outdoor orientation programs in the United States. 　From the results of analyses, the effectiveness and some issues of the <b>Social</b> <b>Provision</b> Scale were found especially subscales. In this study only total score of the <b>social</b> <b>provision</b> were used for analyses. The score of <b>social</b> <b>provision</b> was significantly positively correlated with all factors of the school adjustment including comfortability at school, a sense of being trusted, possession of goals, and absence of a sense of inferiority. Furthermore, students who had higher levels of <b>social</b> <b>provision</b> showed higher levels of satisfaction in their school life, more opportunities to utilize their abilities at school, higher levels of pride regarding their school, and higher levels of personal growths.

40|$|The radical {{difference}} between orthodox and heterodox economics emanates {{from the different}} views of the capitalist socio-economic system. Economics as the science of <b>social</b> <b>provisioning</b> felicitously describes the heterodox view that economy {{is part of the}} evolving social order; social agency is embedded in the social and cultural context; a socio-economic change is driven by technical and cultural changes; and the provisioning process is open-ended. Such a perspective on economy offers ample methodological and theoretical implications for modeling the capitalist economy in a realistic manner. It lends itself especially to the micro-macro synthetic approach. Thus the objective of this paper is twofold: 1) to examine how the concept of the <b>social</b> <b>provisioning</b> process can be clarified and expanded by virtue of recent development in heterodox methodology and 2) to discuss how methodological development would nourish the heterodox modeling and theorizing of the capitalist <b>social</b> <b>provisioning</b> process. ...|$|R
