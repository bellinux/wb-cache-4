6000|$|The {{types of}} slavery in Caliban are more palpable, and need not be dwelt on now: though I will notice them also, severally, in their proper places;--the heart of his slavery is in his worship: [...] "That's a brave god, and bears celestial--liquor." [...] But, in {{illustration}} of {{the sense in which}} the Latin [...] "benignus" [...] and [...] "malignus" [...] are to be coupled with Eleutheria and Douleia, note that Caliban's torment is always the physical reflection of his own nature--"cramps" [...] and [...] "side <b>stiches</b> that shall pen thy breath up; thou shalt be pinched, as thick as honeycombs:" [...] the whole nature of slavery being one cramp and cretinous contraction. Fancy this of Ariel! You may fetter him, but you set no mark on him; you may put him to hard work and far journey, but you cannot give him a cramp.|$|E

50|$|The {{embroidery}} is {{a simplified}} version of embroidery done for centuries, adapted for products {{to be sold}} to the outside world. Pieces generally have multiple figurative elements in stylized form, which are arranged onto the fabric in a geometric pattern, mostly or completely symmetrical. The most common elements are the flora and fauna found Tenango de Doria area including chickens, dogs, wild birds, rabbits, horses, flowers and trees. Sometimes people and other objects appear as well. Other figures include figures from amate paper cut outs made by local shamans/healers and pre historic paintings found in local caves. These elements are most often arranged in a pattern, but can be set up for form scenes from daily life, folk festival and religion. The most common background fabric colors are white and off-white, generally for tablecloths and the like, followed by black, but other colors such as reds and blues are used as well. Most often, the elements are not done in realistic colors, rather using bright colors such as yellows, greens and blues. All elements may be of a single color, or multicolored. If the latter, the colors are most often combined as a series of stripes over the elements. Better tenangos have small, tight <b>stiches,</b> with a well-done tablecloth or bedspread takeing up to six years to make.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to confirm the {{generalizability}} of the conclusions of the <b>STICH</b> (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure) trial. BackgroundSurgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) added to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) did not decrease death or cardiac hospitalization in <b>STICH</b> patients randomized to CABG with (n = 501) or without (n = 499) SVR. MethodsBaseline clinical characteristics of 1, 000 <b>STICH</b> SVR hypothesis patients and 1, 036 STICH-eligible Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) National Cardiac Database patients undergoing CABG plus SVR were entered into a multivariate model equation to predict a mortality that placed these 2, 036 patients in 1 of 32 risk at randomization (RAR) groups. The number of patients in each RAR group profiled the risk of <b>STICH</b> treatment arms and of <b>STICH</b> and STS STICH-eligible patients. ResultsThat 85 % of the 1, 000 <b>STICH</b> patients known to have no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 treatment arms shared the same RAR group suggests that the RAR methodology has sufficient accuracy to compare RAR profiles of <b>STICH</b> and STS patients. RAR group was shared by 1, 522 of 2, 036 <b>STICH</b> and STS STICH-eligible patients (75 %) who underwent CABG plus SVR. Differences in baseline characteristics responsible for more low-risk <b>STICH</b> patients and more high-risk STS patients were modest. Cox proportional hazard ratios of 1, 000 <b>STICH</b> patients in 3 RAR groups suggested by <b>STICH</b> and STS RAR differences showed no differential treatment effect on survival across the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups. ConclusionsThe <b>STICH</b> conclusion of no benefit from adding SVR to CABG applies to a broad spectrum of CABG-eligible patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

40|$|Objectives: To {{analyze the}} {{short and long term}} results of tapes of {{different}} materials used to treat stress urinary incontinence (SUI). A secondary objective was to evaluate the ability to adjust the tape after implantation. Materials and methods: Retrospective chart review of 355 patients with SUI operated between March 2003 and October 2011. Eight different types of transobturator tapes were used: Gynecare TVT-O®, Monarc®, SAFYRE®, Contasure KIM®, I-Stop®, DynaMesh®, Aris® Bandellete and Swing-band®. Results and complications were recorded. Results: The mean age at operation was 61 years. Correction of SUI was achieved in 87. 88 % of cases. The best results were obtained with Contasure KIM® (98. 26 % continence). The tape was well tolerated and was elastic {{enough to be able to}} be adjusted 48 - 72 hours after implantation without deformation. Slings with macropores and over lock <b>stiches</b> on the superior and inferior borders presented the lower rates of postoperative urinary retention, pain, perior postoperative bleeding and urinary tract infections. Conclusions: Transobturator tension free tapes require a short operation time and have a low complication rate. The possibility of adjustment in the early postoperative period increases the success rate and reduces complications. Knotless meshes with macropores and over lock <b>stiches</b> appear to be better balanced, are quite resistant to stretching and deformation when readjusted after implantation and present a low infection rate...|$|E
30|$|Apparel {{functional}} attributes {{influence a}} wearer’s performance (Bye and Hakala 2005; Jin and Black 2012). Quality indicators, such as durability, sewing quality, and shrinkage, may influence a wearer’s action. For example, clothing may tear during training when {{the materials are}} not durable or the <b>stiches</b> are not strong. Shrinkage leads to a poor fit. Poor fitting clothing further restrains movement (Michaelson 2015). For example, loose thigh or tight crotch of rock climbing pants influenced climbers’ movement (Michaelson 2015), garments with excess bulk inhibit sailors’ mobility (Bye and Hakala 2005), and tight sleeves restrict tennis players when serving tennis balls (Jin and Black 2012). Similarly, ill-fitting martial arts pants (e.g., too narrow or too big) may restrict high kick actions.|$|E

30|$|The {{operation}} was started with general anesthesia and isolated lung ventilation in left lateral decubitus position. We made three ports in 4 th intercostal space of middle axillary line (12  mm), 5 th intercostal space of posterior axillary line and 7 th intercostal space of anterior axillary line. When observed with a thoracoscope, every marking was clearly visible {{and then we}} made five <b>stiches</b> along the planned resection lines. Four <b>stiches</b> were placed close to marking spots and one at the border with S 7 at the diaphragmatic surface along the scheduled segmentation lines with 4 – 0 PROLENE® (Johnson & Johnson; New Jersey, USA) and also made another marking above the nodule with silk (Fig. 2 b). Although each dye marking was located on the lung surface at {{the periphery of the}} branchial branch (i.e., inside of the segment), the appropriate intersegmental lines and the locations of blue sutures were determined based on the geometric information obtained from the “lung map.” The lung parenchyma between S 6 and S 8 was cut with staplers along the intersegmental lines. A 8 a, A 8 b, B 8, and V 8 a were cut sequentially. The lung parenchyma between S 8 and S 7 was separated with staplers, and the resected S 8 was taken out from thoracic cavity. Polyglycolic acid mesh and fibrin glue were used to seal minor air leakage from the resected lung parenchyma. Two chest tubes were inserted into the thoracic cavity and the {{operation was}} finished. The operation took about 4  h and the blood loss was 30  ml. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the chest tubes were removed 2  days after the surgery. She was discharged 6  days after the surgery.|$|E

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a bronchopleural fistula {{that caused a}} pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm. Right lower lobectomy via posterolateral thoracotomy was performed to resect the pseudoaneurysm.
