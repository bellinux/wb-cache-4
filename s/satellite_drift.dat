The protocol provides a combination of random access via Slotted ALOHA techniques and demand assigned access using collision requests. This allows efficient bandwidth usage and low average delays. Minimization of earth station cost was a major objective. This was achieved by transferring the bulk of the system complexity to the satellite repeater and the (ground) network controller. This centrally controlled protocol would allow greater system stability and would permit system reconfiguration in response to changes in traffic intensity.

40|$|International audienceA {{comparison}} between NOAA- 16 Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and lidar upper-stratospheric temperature measurements {{for the period}} from 2001 to 2007 for purposes of temperature monitoring is presented. Monthly means of lidar data from the Observatoire de Haute-Provence and AMSU data over Western Europe {{were found to have}} high correlation, particularly in winter months, when based on measurements for overlapping nights but lower correlation when different sets of days were used for the monthly mean calculation. This result implies that temperatures from lidar measurements are representative of an area relatively larger than its location, in a monthly mean timescale. However, the effect of temporal sampling arising from the fact that lidar measurements are only made in nights without visible cloud cover introduces discrepancies that propagate on the calculation of temperature tendencies. The estimated cooling rate based on lidar and AMSU data sets are in good agreement, although they are more negative than trends previously found based on the Stratospheric Sounding Unit data record from 1979 to 2005 for the middle-upper stratosphere. In addition, the effect of NOAA <b>satellite</b> <b>drift</b> was to produce a difference (between monthly means for day and night passes) of up to 3 K near the stratopause, which must be accounted for particularly when a longer time series will be available...|$|E

The European Space Agency (ESA) has recently released {{the new version}} 7 of Level 1 MIPAS spectra, in which {{a new set of}} time-dependent correction coefficients for the non-linearity in the detectors’ response functions was implemeted.

We evaluate the long-term stability of ozone level 2 data retrieved from MIPAS V 7 Level 1 spectra with the IMK/IAA Scientific Level 2 Processor. We compare it with ozone measurements from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on NASA’s Aura satellite, ozonesondes and ground-based lidar instruments. The ozonesondes and lidars alone do not allow us to conclude with enough significance that the new version is more stable than the previous one, but a clear improvement in long-term stability is observed in the satellite-data based drift analysis. The results of ozonesondes, lidars and <b>satellite</b> <b>drift</b> analysis are consistent: all indicate that the drifts of the new version are less negative/more positive nearly everywhere above 15  km.

A new method to estimate {{the direction of the}} mean flow, based on a <b>satellite</b> <b>drift</b> product, is introduced. As a result, the bias in the dispersion introduced by the mean flow is eliminated considering only the displacements of the buoys in the cross-stream direction. Results show an absolute dispersion growing quadratically in time for the first 3 days and an anomalous dispersion regime exhibiting a strongly self-similar scaling following a 5 / 4 power law for time scales larger than 6 days persisting over the whole time series of length 32 days. The non-Gaussian distribution of the velocity fluctuations with a skewness of − 0. 15 and a kurtosis of 7. 33 as well as the slope of the Lagrangian frequency spectrum between − 2 and − 1 are in agreement with the anomalous diffusion regime. Comparison with data from the International Arctic Buoy Program yields similar results with an anomalous dispersion starting after 10 days and persisting over the whole time series of length 50 days. The results suggest the presence of deformation and shear acting on the sea ice dispersion.

The science objectives of UVIT are broad, extending from individual hot stars, star-forming regions to active galactic nuclei. Imaging performance of UVIT would depend on several factors in addition to the optics, e. g. resolution of the detectors, <b>Satellite</b> <b>Drift</b> and Jitter, image frame acquisition rate, sky background, source intensity etc. The use of intensified CMOS-imager based photon counting detectors in UVIT put their own complexity over reconstruction of the images. All these factors could lead to several systematic effects in the reconstructed images. A study has been done through numerical simulations with artificial point sources and archival image of a galaxy from GALEX data archive, to explore the effects of all the above mentioned parameters on the reconstructed images. In particular the issues of angular resolution, photometric accuracy and photometric-nonlinearity associated with the intensified CMOS-imager based photon counting detectors have been investigated. The photon events in image frames are detected by three different centroid algorithms with some energy thresholds. Our results show that in presence of bright sources, reconstructed images from UVIT would suffer from photometric distortion in a complex way and the presence of overlapping photon events could lead to complex patterns near the bright sources. Further the angular resolution, photometric accuracy and distortion would depend on the values of various thresholds chosen to detect photon events.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{finite element}} models were {{established}} for the Newfoundland and Labrador Shelf to investigate climatological monthly mean wind- and density-driven circulation. The model was forced using wind stresses from the National Center for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis data prescribed at the sea surface, large-scale remote forcing determined from a North Atlantic model, monthly mean temperature and salinity climatology, and M 2 tide on the open boundary. The model results were examined against various in situ observations (moored current meter, tide gauge, and vessel-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler data) and <b>satellite</b> <b>drift</b> measurements and discussed together with literature information. The seasonal mean circulation solutions were investigated in terms of relative importance of wind to density forcing for the Labrador Current. The model results indicate significant seasonal and spatial variations, consistent generally with previous study results and in approximate agreement with observations for the major currents. The region {{is dominated by the}} equatorward flowing Labrador Current along the shelf edge and along the Labrador and Newfoundland coasts. The Labrador Current is strong in the fall/winter and weak in the spring/summer. The mean transport of the shelf edge Labrador Current is 7. 5 Sv at the Seat Island transect and 5. 5 Sv through the Flemish Pass. The seasonal ranges are 4. 5 and 5. 2 Sv at the two sections, respectively. Density- and wind-driven components are both important in the inshore Labrador Current.

40|$|During the EU {{research}} project DAMOCLES 18 ice buoys were {{deployed in the}} region of the Arctic transpolar drift (TPD). Sixteen of them formed a square with 400 km side-length. The measurements lasted from 2007 to 2009. The properties of the TPD and the impact of synoptic weather systems on the ice drift are analysed. Compared to Nansen's drift with the vessel Fram the measured speed of the TPD is here almost twice as fast. Within the TPD, the speed increases by a factor of almost three from the North Pole to the Fram Strait region. The hourly buoy position fixes show that the speed is underestimated by 10 – 20 % if positions were taken at only 1 – 3 days intervals as it is usually done for <b>satellite</b> <b>drift</b> estimates. The geostrophic wind factor U i / U g, i. e. the ratio of ice speed U i and geostrophic wind speed U g, in the TPD amounts to 0. 012 on average, but with regional and seasonal differences. The constant U i / U g relation breaks down for U g − 1. The impact of synoptic weather systems is studied applying a composite method. Cyclones (anticyclones) cause cyclonic (anticyclonic) vorticity and divergence (convergence) of the ice drift. The amplitudes are twice as large for cyclones as for anticyclones. The divergence caused by cyclones corresponds to a 0. 1 – 0. 5 %/ 6 h open water area increase based on the composite averages, but reached almost 4 % within one day during a strong August 2007 storm. This storm also caused a~long-lasting (over several weeks) rise of U i and U i / U g and changed the ice conditions in a way allowing ocean tidal motion to directly affect ice motion.

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, many {{analyses}} of space- and ground-based data records reported signs or evidence of increasing ozone {{concentrations in the}} extrapolar upper stratosphere since the late 1990 s. However, the magnitude and significance of the trend estimates vary from one study to another, prompting the ozone research community to further investigate the causes of these differences. A broader consensus has emerged in the past year, placing the positive trend in the upper stratosphere on solid ground and heralding the start of an observation-based exploration of the recovery of stratospheric ozone. More accurate trend estimates are needed to identify the geophysical processes contributing to the recovery and their relative importance. Uncovering seasonal and spatial trend patterns will be key in reaching this objective, {{not just in the}} extrapolar upper stratosphere but elsewhere as well. However, at the moment, it remains unclear whether current ozone profile observing systems are able to provide this information. We address this question with an exploration of the capabilities and limitations of current data records in space (limb/occultation sounders) and on the ground (NDACC/GAW/SHADOZ-affiliated sonde, stratospheric lidar and microwave radiometer sites) to infer decadal trends and their vertical, latitudinal and seasonal patterns. We focus on long-term stability, one of the key drivers of the ability to detect trends. We present updated results of a comprehensive analysis that allowed us to quantify the drift of satellite data relative to the ground-based networks (Hubert et al., 2016). In a companion analysis we exploited the satellite data to uncover temporal and spatial inhomogeneities in the ground-based time series, some of which were traced to known changes occurring at different moments across the network. These changes add to the challenge to derive unbiased ozone trends from ground-based observations and they impede our ability to constrain <b>satellite</b> <b>drift</b> to the level required for current and future ozone trend assessments. We conclude that ongoing efforts to homogenise the ground-based data records are essential...|$|E
40|$|Space-based {{tracking}} {{missions are}} an emerging interest {{that could be}} accomplished using a cluster of microsatellites. This thesis addresses the design of microsatellite clusters to accurately track a target in a probabilistic suborbital occupancy corridor by pursuing the following: orbit determination using optimal measurement principles, cluster design heuristics and fuel optimal cluster maintenance. These are all evaluated on a high-fidelity simulation testbed. First, the orbital determination approach utilizes optimal measurement principles to design a constellation of clusters that minimizes the average model-based target tracking error. A two part approach, (1) constellation design and (2) cluster design, reduces the overall orbit determination complexity. The constellation design provides continuous, 24 hour coverage of the occupancy corridor and virtual formation centers about which the cluster design formulates the relative microsatellite orbits. Results suggest that satellite separations, rather {{than the number of}} the microsatellites in the cluster, are more important for providing target tracking accuracy. (cont.) Results also show that the J 2 -induced relative drift of the satellites in a cluster can be reduced by several orders of magnitude with very little degradation in the cluster's tracking capability. Second, this research formulates a cluster design heuristic that provides a robust cluster viewing geometry for a target in any direction. This robust design heuristic provides tracking capability for a cluster that is demonstrated to be comparable to one specifically tuned for a particular target orbit. Third, this thesis presents a receding horizon Model Predictive Control approach to cluster maintenance that exhibits reduced cluster-wide fuel expenditure by allowing relative <b>satellite</b> <b>drift</b> while maintaining mission driven cluster characteristics. The controller achieves this performance by being robust to unmodeled dynamics and noise. Finally, the performance of the integrated cluster-based orbit determination, tracking and control laws is demonstrated on a high-fidelity, multi-satellite simulation testbed. Results include tracking performance and trade-offs as a function of various control objectives. by John Daniel Griffith. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|We work on {{a student}} 3 U Cubesat mission, called JUMPSAT, {{expected}} for 2017. This is a collaborative project involving both institutions (CNES, ONERA) and schools (ISAE, TELECOM Bretagne). The different equipments to qualify are the Supaero Star Tracker, which measures stars’ luminosity to infer the satellite’s attitude, a detector for particles trapped in the Earth magnetic field designed by the ONERA, and the AOCS. Uplink and Downlink communications will be provided during the mission by the HETE Primary Ground Stations. JUMPSAT is the first Cubesat which needs a three axis attitude control, which involves an innovative mission analysis, to overcome all these constraints. The mission analysis deals with the orbit’s determination, the Cubesat’s structure, the power strategy, and the visibility balance. The particles detector is the only constraint for the altitude of the satellite: we can get meaningful data only at altitudes higher than 700 km. Moreover, the most interesting zones are South Atlantic and poles. But a circular orbit with this altitude does not respect the LOS (French space act). The structure of the Cubesat is also hard to define. To get information from the satellite, we need an antenna, and an attitude and orbital control system to point the antenna at the ground station and the Star Tracker at the stars. Solar Panels cannot be opened out because of the micro elements that could be settled on the particles detector. However, fixed solar panels are not very efficient to recharge batteries. The power balance shows critical problems: both attitude control system and the Star Tracker consume a lot, and cannot work {{at the same time}} during the whole orbit. However, all the components are linked: the Star Tracker is not efficient if the satellite attitude is not stabilized; the antenna functioning must be synchronized with visibilities by the ground station. Anyway, the visibility balance stresses the point that a ground station at Toulouse would be particularly welcome. We need also to take into account phenomena of eclipse and <b>satellite</b> <b>drift.</b> To conclude, our mission analysis is deeply constrained by the equipments we want to qualify. Our task is to find the optimal orbit, suggest a power strategy considering the orbital constraints and components’ physical parameters, and to study the visibility balance.

40|$|Stratospheric {{temperature}} series {{derived from}} the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) on board successive NOAA satellites reveal, during periods of overlap, some bias and drifts.

NOAA 15 and 16, which exhibit a long period of overlap, allow deriving diurnal tides that can correct such temperature drifts. The characteristics of the derived diurnal tides during summer periods is in good agreement with those calculated with the Global Scale Wave Model, indicating that most of the observed drifts are likely due to the atmospheric tides. Cooling can be biased by a factor of 2, if times of measurement are not considered. When diurnal tides are considered, trends derived from temperature lidar series are in good agreement with AMSU series. Future adjustments of temperature time series based on successive AMSU instruments will require considering corrections associated with the local times of measurement...|$|R
