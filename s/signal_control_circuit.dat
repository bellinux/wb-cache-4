Position system encountered high data error rate in the past mainly due to the difficulty in controlling the read/write head's positions. In order to achieve low error rate a compact microcomputer controlled position system was designed. This microcomputer controlled system provides velocity and position commands, memorizes and controls the read/write head's position, monitors read/write head's deviation and system's operation. The system consists of a microcomputer, a position signal summing junction, a trans conductance power amplifier {{and a set of}} position <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> <b>circuits.</b> The objective of this design is to achieve fast seek time, high accuracy, good performance, compact and low cost.

40|$|SummaryNeural circuit {{formation}} {{relies on}} interactions between axons and cells within the target field. While {{it is well}} established that target-derived signals act on axons to regulate circuit assembly, {{the extent to which}} axon-derived <b>signals</b> <b>control</b> <b>circuit</b> formation is not known. In the Drosophila visual system, anterograde signals numerically match R 1 –R 6 photoreceptors with their targets by controlling target proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Here we demonstrate that additional axon-derived signals selectively couple target survival with layer specificity. We show that Jelly belly (Jeb) produced by R 1 –R 6 axons interacts with its receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk), on budding dendrites to control survival of L 3 neurons, one of three postsynaptic targets. L 3 axons then produce Netrin, which regulates the layer-specific targeting of another neuron within the same circuit. We propose that a cascade of axon-derived signals, regulating diverse cellular processes, provides a strategy for coordinating circuit assembly across different regions of the nervous system...|$|R

Studies in animals and humans have identified spatially segregated functional territories in the basal ganglia for the control of goal-directed and habitual actions. In patients with Parkinson's disease the loss of dopamine is predominantly in the posterior putamen, a region of the basal ganglia associated with the control of habitual behaviour. These patients may therefore be forced into a progressive reliance on the goal-directed mode of action control that is mediated by comparatively preserved processing in the rostromedial striatum. Thus, many of their behavioural difficulties may reflect a loss of normal automatic control owing to distorting output <b>signals</b> from habitual <b>control</b> <b>circuits,</b> which impede the expression of goal-directed action. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
