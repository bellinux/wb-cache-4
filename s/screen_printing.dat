5|$|In {{the case}} of {{crystalline}} silicon modules, the solder material, that joins together the copper strings of the cells, contains about 36 percent of lead (Pb). Moreover, the paste used for <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> front and back contacts contains traces of Pb and sometimes Cd as well. It is estimated that about 1,000 metric tonnes of Pb {{have been used for}} 100 gigawatts of c-Si solar modules. However, there is no fundamental need for lead in the solder alloy.|$|E
5|$|She {{learned to}} draw during her {{schooling}} at Papunya and Haasts Bluff, but her first {{experience as a}} painter came working on backgrounds for the pictures created by her father. From the Pintupi/Luritja language group, Daisy Jugadai {{was one of a}} range of artists who came to painting through the Ikuntji Women's Centre in the early 1990s. She is credited with {{a significant role in the}} centre's establishment. She began with <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> and linocut printmaking, but quickly shifted to acrylic painting, producing many of her best works during the mid-1990s. Western Desert artists such as Daisy Jugadai will frequently paint particular 'dreamings' or Tjukurrpa for which they have personal responsibility or rights. A complex concept, Tjukurrpa refers to the spiritual knowledge of the landscape and custodianship of it; it also refers to laws, rules or stories that people must maintain and re-produce in their communities. Daisy Jugadai portrayed in her art both those for which she had personal responsibility, and those of her late husband and late father. These included honey ant, spinifex and emu dreamings; geographical locations that were the settings for these paintings included Muruntji waterhole and Talabarrdi, and other locations around Kungkayunti, where her family had lived for many years.|$|E

40|$|Thin {{films of}} organic moiety {{functionalized}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{from a very}} well-dispersed aqueous solution were designed on a <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> transducer surface through a single step directed assembly methodology. Very high density of CNTs was obtained on the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> electrode surface, {{with the formation of}} a thin and uniform layer on transducer substrate. Functionalized CNTs were characterized by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Brunauer–Emmett– Teller (BET) surface area analyzer methodologies, while CNT coated <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> transducer platform was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The proposed methodology makes use of a minimum amount of CNTs and toxic solvents, and is successfully demonstrated to form thin films over macroscopic areas of <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> carbon transducer surface. The CNT coated <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> transducer surface was integrated in the fabrication of electrochemical aptasensors for breast cancer biomarker analysis.

40|$|A <b>Screen</b> <b>printed</b> {{potentiometric}} urea biosensor {{is developed}} {{to monitor the}} blood urea level non-invasively using reverse iontophoresis (RI). The working electrode is <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> using graphitic carbon paste, reference and RI electrodes are <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> using silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) paste. Urease enzyme is immobilized in the polypyrrole (PPy) matrix of the working electrode using optimized cyclic voltammetry parameters to obtain maximum sensor performance. Electrochemical and material characterizations conducted in the <b>Screen</b> <b>Printed</b> Reference Electrodes (SPRE) are examined to ensure their stability and retention of their properties. The developed <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sensors exhibited sensitivity of 35. 07 mV/decade and showed liner response for the range, 10 mu M to 5 mM with a correlation co-efficient of 0. 995. Interference studies with KCl, NaCl and MgCl 2 solutions are performed and {{it was found that}} sensor performance is unaffected due to interference ions. The urea sensor is further validated by conducting clinical investigations on 15 human subjects. A correlation is established between blood urea level and transdermal extracted urea level and the correlation co-efficient is found to be 0. 391. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.
