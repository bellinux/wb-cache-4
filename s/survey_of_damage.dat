This technique has previously been applied to large magnitude earthquakes, {{but this is the}} first application to a moderate size event.

40|$|Transportation {{networks}} {{are essential for}} a functional society and are {{a major component of}} civil infrastructure. The importance of a functioning network is heightened in a post-earthquake situation. More stress is placed on road networks to provide transportation for rescue, repair, and relief teams. Roads, approaches, and embankments represent significant elements in the transportation network. Understanding the performance of these elements is crucial to comprehending whole network performance before, during, and after a natural disaster such as an earthquake. Currently, seismic performance of roads, approaches, and embankments is not well studied. This study seeks to remedy that by investigating the seismic performance of embankments. First, a comprehensive <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to roads, approaches, and embankments is undertaken and damage states are categorized and classified. Limit states are developed that correspond to these damage classifications for both the pavement and earthquake engineering communities. The earthquake scenario is simulated using synthetically generated accelerograms representative of ground motions of the Central United States (CEUS). Analytical models are developed and subjected to dynamic time history analysis. First, a benchmark full bond model is developed and analyzed. Parametric studies on geometry, material properties, and interface conditions are conducted using a variety of models. Both 4 meter and 6 meter embankment heights are investigated along with models incorporating different interface condition models. Seismic performance of the embankment is then assessed mainly by investigating peak displacements of the various analysis cases. Previously established limit states are evaluated and embankment response is characterized according to limit state exceedance. Results of this study show exceedance of the ???slight??? engineering community limit state, and exceedance of both the functional and structural damage pavement community limit states...|$|E
40|$|Damage to corn by {{blackbirds}} (Icteridae) {{has been}} an economic problem throughout historical times in North America. Ohio, with the highest nesting season population density of red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) in North America and large acreages of corn, has been a key state in this conflict. <b>Survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> from 1968 to 1979 revealed that blackbirds annually destroyed less than 1 % of the corn crops in Ohio, a 4 - to 6 -million dollar loss at 1979 prices. This total dollar loss is somewhat misleading because of the uneven distribution of damage among fields. Over 97 % of the cornfields in Ohio receive less than 5 % loss and these losses make up about 60 % of the total loss in the State. Damage control efforts need to be primarily directed toward the remaining 3 % of the fields that often incur losses greater than 5 % and constitute about 40 % of the total loss in the State. Most of these fields are located within 8 km (5 miles) of the marshes containing concentrations of roosting birds in late summer. Successful programs to reduce damage must use {{one or more of}} a series of management measures, integrated with normal farming practices. The selection of management measures should be based on assessments of amount and type of bird damage likely to occur in a field and constraints imposed by farming practices. Management recommendations include (1) planting of hybrids with ear tips well covered by husks; (2) reduction of weed and insect populations to make the field less attractive to birds; (3) judicious use of mechanical frightening devices or a chemical frightening agent at the time birds initially damage the maturing corn; (4) the provision of natural or planted food and cover sites outside the corn; and (5) harvesting the crop, especially sweet corn, as early as possible...|$|E

40|$|The Fujita Scale, and {{subsequently}} the Enhanced Fujita Scale, {{were developed to}} enable maximum probable wind speed estimation following tornadoes where no formal measurements were possible. These scales rely on predetermined relationships between wind speed and resultant damage to, for example, buildings and foliage so localised maximum wind speeds can be estimated. More recently, these relationships have been coupled, along with detailed post-event damage survey information, into complex numerical models so that general storm characteristics {{as well as their}} localised intensities can be estimated. An example of this is the use of observed tree fall information after the 2011 Joplin tornado to estimate wind speeds throughout the impacted region (Lombardo et al., 2015). These concepts are not limited to use with localised wind events and may be applied to large-scale storms such as tropical cyclones. Following the landfall of Tropical Cyclone Marcia in February 2015, a damage survey team from James Cook University, the University of Queensland and Risk Frontiers undertook a field <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to buildings and foliage throughout the impacted regions of Rockhampton, Yeppoon and the surrounding areas. Aerial imagery was used to aid the characterisation of damage patterns, as too was observed damage to simple structures such as failed road signs. Estimates of probable maximum surface wind speed and direction have been made considering these data in conjunction with data recorded at AWS stations throughout the region. An analysis of tree -fall in areas North of Yeppoon, nearer to the landfall of TC Marcia, was also undertaken to estimate the probable maximum wind speed and storm structure.

40|$|Accurate {{debris and}} {{meteoroid}} flux models are {{crucial for the}} design of manned and unmanned space missions. For the most abundant particle sizes smaller than a few millimetres, knowledge of the populations can only be gained from in situ detectors or the analysis of retrieved space hardware. The measurement of impact flux from exposed surfaces improves with increased surface area and exposure time. A post-flight impact investigation was initiated by the European Space Agency to record and analyse the impact fluxes and any potential resulting damage on the two flexible solar arrays of the Hubble Space Telescope. The arrays were deployed during the first Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission in December 1993 and retrieved in March 2002. They have a total exposed surface area of roughly 120 m 2, including 42 m 2 covered with solar cells. This new Hubble post-flight impact study follows a similar activity undertaken after the retrieval of one of the first solar arrays, in 1993. The earlier study provided the first opportunity for a numerical <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to exposed surfaces from more than 600 km altitude, and of impacts from particles larger than 1 mm. The results have proven very valuable in validation of important flux model regimes. The second set of Hubble solar arrays has again provided an unrivalled opportunity to measure the meteoroid and debris environment, now sampled during a long interval in low Earth orbit, and to identify changes in the space debris environment since the previous survey. The retrieved solar array wings exhibit thousands of craters, many of which are visible to the naked eye. A few hundred impacts have completely penetrated the 0. 7 mm thick array. The largest impact features are about 7 - 8 mm in diameter. The cover glass of the solar cells is particularly well suited to the recognition of small impact features by optical and electron microscopy. In this, paper, we present the first results of the impact survey. Data upon the abundance of craters of specific measured size ranges are plotted as cumulative flux curves, and compared to the results of model predictions. The most significant change to the particle flux since 1993 is a decrease in the small debris population...|$|E
40|$|The Nihonkai-Chubu Earthquake (M= 7. 7) {{occurred}} on May 26, 1983. This earthquake caused severe damage to many buildings, mostly in Akita and Aomori prefectures. This {{is a report}} on a visual <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to buildings in {{the main part of}} affected area. The feature of the damage to buildings is {{the fact that most of}} it was caused by ground deformation due to liquefaction. In this area, wooden houses have very light roofs made of galvanized sheet iron. So, even when a house suffered severe damage, it rarely fell down. The districts where buildings were heavily damaged by such ground deformation as sliding and subsidence are Arayamoto-machi and Arayamatsumi-cho in Akita city, Wakimoto in Oga city, Wakami-cho, Hachiru-cho, Noshiro city, all of which are in Akita prefecture, and Shariki-mura and Azigasawa-cho in Aomori prefecture. Damage to expansion joints in reinforced concrete buildings was widespread in the affected district. The Noshiro Shogyo High School buildings were some of those a most severely damaged by the earthquake. Two buildings of the school are of 4 -story reinforced concrete structure and two gymnasiums are of 1 -story steel structure, and the buildings and gymnasiums stand on very soft sand ground, so the two reinforced concrete buildings are supported by piles. The heaviest damage occurred at the expansion joint portion of the passage between the two reinforced concrete buildings. The connected portion was separated from each other by 9 cm and slid 15 cm apart on the 4 th floor. Simlar damage also occurred at the connected portion of the passage between the gymnasium and the reinforced concrete building. There were also heavy cracks and traces of the sand emission due to liquefaction on the school ground and the two septic tanks were buoyed up by this phenomenon. The damage to buildings caused by this earthquake gives important lessons for earthquake resistant design of buildings including wooden houses, reinforced concrete structures and others. It is important to consider the planning of a building fundation and the investigation of the dynamic behavior of soils where the ground is apt to be liquefied...|$|E

40|$|The devastating {{earthquake}} {{that on the}} 6 th of April 2009, struck the city of L'Aquila and surrounding villages in the Abruzzo Region {{represents one of the}} most damaging natural events which have occurred in Italy in the last century. The causes of structural building failures have constituted a central topic for researchers from different sectors, focusing attention both on the seismic behaviour of structural and non-structural elements, and on the ground role which presented local amplification effects. The investigation presented here aims to achieve an overall comprehension of structural [1] and non-structural vulnerabilities under the seismic input. Starting from a preliminary qualitative <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage,</b> developed in the post-event period, the investigation has been deepened through in situ tests [2, 3] and numerical analyses. The chapter illustrates the role and the perspective of computational mechanics in different tasks currently under investigation at the new earthquake research centre of the University of L'Aquila (CERFIS). The advances in computing analysis and the need to evaluate the structural elasto-plastic behaviour have introduced several models that are able to reproduce the nonlinear behaviour of the structural elements realized by the different materials using in civil engineering. The extensive scientific literature, available both on nonlinear modelling of reinforce concrete and masonry elements, is discussed here. Preliminary evaluation of the modelling of the seismic action is treated starting from the accelerometer registration, introducing some concepts regarding the possible local effects which characterize the L'Aquila region. Indeed, the observation of the damage scenario distribution provides some evidence of the anomalous effects on the civil structures. Through analyses of the case studies of the Palazzo Camponeschi and Edifice A of the Engineering Faculty Campus of the University of L'Aquila, which represent a particular choice arising from the special and through investigation activities done by different research groups, the models formulated are discussed. In particular, main emphasis is placed on the comparison between the immediate damage scenario and its evolution during the aftershocks with the results obtained by nonlinear structural analyses. The macro element and finite element models used to examine the masonry edifice and the reinforce concrete structure, are fully described, highlighting the role of nonlinear modelling in the final design of the seismic retrofitting of the two buildings...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of remote}} sensing within {{the domain of}} natural hazards and {{disaster}} management has become increasingly popular, {{due in part to}} increased awareness of environmental issues, including climate change, but also to the improvement of geospatial technologies and the ability to provide high quality imagery to the public through the media and internet. As technology is enhanced, demand and expectations increase for near-real-time monitoring and images to be relayed to emergency services {{in the event of a}} natural disaster. During a seismic event, in particular, it is fundamental to obtain a fast and reliable map of the damage of urban areas to manage civil protection interventions. Moreover, the identification of the destruction caused by an earthquake provides seismology and earthquake engineers with informative and valuable data, experiences and lessons in the long term. An accurate <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> is also important to assess the economic losses, and to manage and share the resources to be allocated during the reconstruction phase. Satellite remote sensing can provide valuable pieces of information on this regard, thanks to the capability of an instantaneous synoptic view of the scene, especially if the seismic event is located in remote regions, or if the main communication systems are damaged. Many works exist in the literature on this topic, considering both optical data and radar data, which however put in evidence some limitations of the nadir looking view, of the achievable level of details and response time, and the criticality of image radiometric and geometric corrections. The visual interpretation of optical images collected before and after a seismic event is the approach followed in many cases, especially for an operational and rapid release of the damage extension map. Many papers, have evaluated change detection approaches to estimate damage within large areas (e. g., city blocks), trying to quantify not only the extension of the affected area but also the level of damage, for instance correlating the collapse ratio (percentage of collapsed buildings in an area) measured on ground with some change parameters derived from two images, taken before and after the earthquake. Nowadays, remotely sensed images at Very High Resolution (VHR) may in principle enable production of earthquake damage maps at single-building scale. The complexity of the image forming mechanisms within urban settlements, especially of radar images, makes the interpretation and analysis of VHR images still a challenging task. Discrimination of lower grade of damage is particularly difficult using nadir looking sensors. Automatic algorithms to detect the damage are being developed, although as matter of fact, these works focus very often on specific test cases and sort of canonical situations. In order to make the delivered product suitable for the user community, such for example Civil Protection Departments, it is important to assess its reliability on a large area and in different and challenging situations. Moreover, the assessment shall be directly compared to those data the final user adopts when carrying out its operational tasks. This kind of assessment can be hardly found in the literature, especially when the main focus is on the development of sophisticated and advanced algorithms. In this work, the feasibility of earthquake damage products at the scale of individual buildings, which relies on a damage scale recognized as a standard, is investigated. To this aim, damage maps derived from VHR satellite images collected by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical sensors, were systematically compared to ground surveys carried out by different teams and with different purposes and protocols. Moreover, the inclusion of a priori information, such as vulnerability models for buildings and soil geophysical properties, to improve the reliability of the resulting damage products, was considered in this study. The research activity presented in this thesis was carried out in the framework of the APhoRISM (Advanced PRocedures for volcanIc Seismic Monitoring) project, funded by the European Union under the EC-FP 7 call. APhoRISM was aimed at demonstrating that an appropriate management and integration of satellite and ground data can provide new improved products useful for seismic and volcanic crisis management...|$|E
