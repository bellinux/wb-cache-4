5|$|A <b>second</b> <b>draft</b> was {{finished}} by September. Captain Blumburtt, Chattar Lal, {{and the boy}} Maharaja originally had more crucial roles. A dogfight was deleted, {{as well as those}} who drank the Kali blood turned into zombies with physical superhuman abilities. During pre-production, the Temple of Death title was replaced with Temple of Doom. From March to April 1983, Huyck and Katz simultaneously performed rewrites for a final shooting script.|$|E
5|$|The {{first draft}} {{and part of}} the editing process was {{completed}} before Fleming's death and the manuscript had passed through the hands of his copy editor, William Plomer, but it was not as polished as other Bond stories. Much of the detail contained in the previous novels was missing, as this was often added by Fleming in the <b>second</b> <b>draft.</b> Publishers Jonathan Cape passed the manuscript to Kingsley Amis for his thoughts and advice on the story, although his suggestions were not subsequently used.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, The Exorcist was re-released in a 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback, hardcover, and {{audiobook}} formats {{with new}} cover artwork. As described by Blatty, this new, updated edition features new and revised material. The 40th Anniversary Edition of The Exorcist {{will have a}} touch of new material in {{it as part of}} an all-around polish of the dialogue and prose. First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a <b>second</b> <b>draft,</b> and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable â€“ plus one new character in a totally new very spooky scene. This is the version I would like to be remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, Sony {{announced}} that Druckmann {{was writing a}} film adaptation of The Last of Us, produced by Sam Raimi and distributed by Screen Gems. By January 2015, Druckmann had written the script's <b>second</b> <b>draft,</b> and performed a read-through with some actors. Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered development hell. Druckmann is currently co-writing a sequel to the first game, titled The Last of Us Part II, alongside Halley Gross; Straley will not return to co-direct the game. In August 2017, Druckmann was featured as a guest judge on an episode of Face Off.|$|E
5|$|In the {{drafts of}} the Alien Resurrection screenplay, writer Joss Whedon {{included}} a death {{scene in which}} a lifeform was sucked through {{a gap in the}} hull of a ship. In the <b>second</b> <b>draft,</b> Perez was sucked through a fist-sized breach in the hull of the Auriga; this was changed in the final version to the Newborn being sucked through the window of the Betty. 20th Century Fox executives were skeptical about the final version, seeing it as a comedic scene contrasting with the overall tone of the Alien franchise, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet persuaded them to leave the scene in.|$|E

40|$|This study tests three {{different}} interventions for {{hard of hearing}} students who have written language needs. Participants wrote first drafts of narratives, and retold the narrative to the investigator, who represented the retelling in three ways: (a) through simple picture sequences, (b) through picture sequences with added graphic elements, and (c) with direct instruction in graphic element meaning. Following the verbal-visual interventions, students wrote <b>second</b> <b>drafts.</b> The addition of graphic elements to picture sequences allowed participants to improve <b>second</b> <b>drafts</b> of stories, resulting in syntax, semantics and story grammar that more closely approximated the writing of children with normal hearing. Direct instruction in the meaning of graphic elements resulted in further improvement in <b>second</b> <b>drafts</b> by {{three of the four}} participants, with an observable impact on certain variables, specifically: (a) length of story, (b) length of T-unit, (c) increase in precise vocabulary use, (d) decrease in proportion of syntactic cohesive ties, (e) {{increase in the number of}} cohesive categories and (f) improved total scores for story grammar elements. ^ Although general trends were noted, in all cases there were complex interactions between student characteristics, targeted writing skills, and intervention types. Implications of the findings from this investigation for teachers of students who are hard of hearing are presented. The need for further study is discussed. ...|$|R

Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered development hell. In November 2016, Raimi stated that the film was at a standstill after Sony had a disagreement with Druckmann. Actress Maisie Williams expressed enthusiasm in playing Ellie, and was in talks with both Druckmann and Raimi to take the role.|$|E
5|$|Stead {{began writing}} the novel in 2002, but her first draft was {{confusing}} and unorganized. To help her, she met editor Wendy Lamb who advised her {{to meet with}} a small group of people who would help critique the novel. After three years of work, Stead finished the <b>second</b> <b>draft</b> and met with Lamb who once again helped make improvements and later published the novel. Reviewers praised the description of Gracehope and main characters, as well as the performances of Coleen Marlo and David Ackroyd who voiced Thea and Peter in a subsequent audiobook publication of First Light.|$|E
5|$|Vince Gilligan and John August rewrote Ngo's script, and Jonathan Mostow was {{attached}} to direct the film. Under Mostow's supervision, a ten-page treatment was written to be pitched to Will Smith to portray the lead role in the film. Neither Mostow nor Smith was yet committed to make the project an active priority at the time. Several studios pursued the opportunity to finance the film, and Columbia Pictures succeeded in acquiring the prospect in February 2005. A <b>second</b> <b>draft</b> was scripted by Gilligan following the finalization of the deal with Columbia. The film was initially slated for a holiday 2006 release.|$|E

5|$|For Season 17, John Lloyd, a {{frequent}} collaborator with script editor Douglas Adams, adapted material from his unpublished science fiction story GiGax and in October 1978 submitted Shylock, a four-part serial written in Adams' light-hearted style. After providing a <b>second</b> <b>draft</b> of the storyline to modify {{parts of the}} script to avoid {{issues such as the}} rules involving child actors, Lloyd was forced to focus on his commitments as producer of Not the Nine O'Clock News. Williams was still interested enough in the storyline that he made plans to involved writer Allan Prior to work on the scripts. The storyline was commissioned on 7 February 1979 and a script list dated 29 June 1979 links Lloyd and Prior to the project. Lloyd officially agreed to another writer taking on his story on 25 August 1979. In the story, the Doctor is subpoenaed to appear in court when a corporation tries to buy Earth in order to obtain a matter-transmutation device.|$|E
5|$|In one draft, Picard kills Data {{early in}} the film, and the android is later resurrected to help the Captain in the finale. The first two drafts {{featured}} the Romulans as the protagonists, since they had never prominently appeared in a Star Trek film. The <b>second</b> <b>draft</b> was seen by Jonathan Dolgen at the studio; Dolgen was not pleased and Patrick Stewart {{thought that it would}} have been only suitable for a television episode. In the third draft, the Son'a were introduced as the children of the Ba'ku and the alien race that wanted to plunder the planet. That version also included the crew sub-plots, such as the Troi-Riker romance and the regeneration of La Forge's eyes. Stewart, who was concerned that the film was a step back in scope from First Contact, was consulted on the treatments.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{form for}} the Aztex {{attracted}} the attention of the Portland Timbers, a Major League Soccer expansion side for the 2011 season. At the end of the 2010 league season, Johnson was announced as one of the Timbers first four signings, along with Steve Cronin, Ryan Pore and Bright Dike. Because Portland had <b>second</b> <b>draft</b> pick behind fellow expansion side Vancouver Whitecaps, they announced they had previously signed Johnson, by taking him to their former USL side before the transfer deadline on 14 August and loaning him back to the Aztex {{for the remainder of the}} 2010 season. He was listed on the Timbers' roster as a forward. Johnson was a late substitute for Jorge Perlaza in the Timbers' first MLS home game and fourth in all, as they defeated Chicago Fire 4â€“2 on 15 April 2011.|$|E

5|$|Lucas {{spent the}} rest of 1971 and early 1972 trying to raise {{financing}} for the American Graffiti script. During this time, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures all turned down the opportunity to co-finance and distribute the film. Lucas, Huyck and Katz rewrote the <b>second</b> <b>draft</b> together, which, in addition to Modesto, was also set in Mill Valley and Los Angeles. Lucas also intended to end American Graffiti showing a title card detailing the fate of the characters, including the death of Milner and the disappearance of Toad in Vietnam. Huyck and Katz found the ending depressing and were incredulous that Lucas planned to include only the male characters. Lucas argued that mentioning the girls meant adding another title card, which he felt would prolong the ending. Because of this, Pauline Kael later accused Lucas of chauvinism.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} matches on the undercard was between Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. At {{the start of the}} year, Angle and Michaels both participated in the Royal Rumble match at the 2005 Royal Rumble {{pay-per-view}} event. During the match, Michaels eliminated Angle. In retaliation, Angle returned to the match and eliminated Michaels and then attacked him outside the ring. The two engaged in a feud, which led to an Interpromotional match at WrestleMania 21, as Angle was part of the SmackDown! roster and Michaels belonged to the Raw roster. At WrestleMania 21, Angle got the win over Michaels by forcing him to submit to the Ankle Lock. On the June 13 episode of Raw, Angle was revealed to be the <b>second</b> <b>draft</b> pick for the Raw brand. That same evening, Michaels challenged Angle to a rematch at Vengeance, which Angle accepted.|$|E
5|$|Universal {{approved}} of the script with Robert Zemeckis as executive producer, and pre-production for King Kong started. The plan was to begin filming sometime in 1997 for a summer 1998 release date. Weta Digital and Weta Workshop, {{under the supervision of}} Richard Taylor and Christian Rivers, began work on early visual effects tests, specifically the complex task of building a CGI version of New York City circa 1933. Jackson and Walsh progressed with a <b>second</b> <b>draft</b> script, sets were being designed and location scouting commenced in Sumatra and New Zealand. In late 1996, Jackson flew to production of the 1997 film Titanic in Mexico to discuss the part of Ann Darrow with Kate Winslet, with whom he previously worked with on his 1994 film Heavenly Creatures. Minnie Driver was also being reportedly considered. Jackson's choices for Jack Driscoll and Carl Denham included George Clooney and Robert De Niro. However, development for King Kong was stalled in January 1997 when Universal became concerned over the upcoming release of the 1998 film Godzilla, as well as other ape-related remakes with the 1998 film Mighty Joe Young and the 2001 film Planet of the Apes. Universal abandoned King Kong in February 1997 after Weta Workshop and Weta Digital had already designed six months worth pre-production. Jackson then decided to start work on The Lord of the Rings film series.|$|E

25|$|A novelization of {{the film}} based on the <b>second</b> <b>draft</b> of the {{screenplay}} was published in 1982 by Alan Dean Foster. Although the novel is generally true to the film, there are minor differences: the Windows character is named Sanders, and an episode in which MacReady, Bennings and Childs chase after several infected dogs which escape into the Antarctic wastes was added (this sequence was featured in Lancaster's <b>second</b> <b>draft</b> of the screenplay). The disappearance of Nauls is also explained in the novel; pursued by the Blair-Thing into a dead end, he kills himself rather than allow it to assimilate him.|$|E
