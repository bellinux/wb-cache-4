25|$|Eagle Scout hat pins were {{produced}} from 1921 through 1958 with several variations. Eagle Scouts who earned additional merit badges were recognized using Eagle Palms, introduced in 1927. Adults who had earned Eagle Scout {{began to be}} recognized in 1934 with a red, white and blue ribbon bar. In 1940, a small eagle pin {{was added to the}} bar. Ribbon bars were replaced by embroidered square knot patches in 1947. Over the years, the knot was produced with various background colors to match the different uniforms. Although the Venturing and Sea Scout programs use different uniform shirts, the current knot is available only with a tan background that matches the Boy Scout uniform. When the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (DESA) was created in 1969, a gold-colored eagle device was introduced for wear on the Eagle Scout square knot. The Eagle Scout Mentor pin was introduced in early 2004 in a gold-colored version. In early 2006 it was changed to a silver-colored antique finish to match the mother and father pins but in 2007 was changed back to gold-colored. In 2008, the National Eagle Scout Association (NESA) introduced a knot recognizing those Eagle Scouts who are life members of NESA; it uses the <b>standard</b> <b>knot</b> emblem with a silver border.|$|E
40|$|A {{persistent}} lamination for a knot K is {{an essential}} lamination in the complement of K, which remains essential after every non-trivial Dehn surgery along K. Having a persistent lamination implies, for example, that every manifold obtained by non-trivial Dehn surgery along K has universal cover R^ 3. In this paper we present a method for building persistent laminations for knots from an incompressible Seifert surface for some `parent' knot. Using this construction, we can, for example, currently build persistent laminations for approximately 45 percent of the knots in the <b>standard</b> <b>knot</b> tables; see page 12 of the paper, or [URL] for the exact list.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} knot {{is simply}} a closed curve in three-space. Classifying open knots, or knots {{that have not been}} closed, is a relatively unexplored area of knot theory. In this note, we report on our study of open random walks of varying length, creating a collection of open knots. Following the strategy of Millett, Dobay and Stasiak, an open knot is closed by connecting its two open endpoints to a third point, lying on a large sphere that encloses the random walk deeply within its interior. The resulting polygonal knot can be analyzed and its knot type determined, up to the indeterminacy of <b>standard</b> <b>knot</b> invariants, using the HOMFLY polynomial. With many closure points uniformly distributed on the large sphere, a statistical distribution of knot types is created for each open knot. We use this method to continue the exploration of the knottedness of linear random walks and apply it also to the study of several protein chains. One new feature of this work is the use of an Eckert IV planar projection, preserving area, of the knotting distribution on the sphere to characterize the spatial properties of the distribution. 1...|$|E

40|$|We offer a {{pedestrian}} level {{review of the}} wall-crossing invariants. The story begins from the scattering theory in quantum mechanics where the spectrum reshuffling {{can be related to}} permutations of S-matrices. In non-trivial situations, starting from spin chains and matrix models, the S-matrices are operator-valued and their algebra is described in terms of R- and mixing (Racah) U-matrices. Then, the Kontsevich-Soibelman (KS) invariants are nothing but the <b>standard</b> <b>knot</b> invariants made out of these data within the Reshetikhin-Turaev-Witten approach. The R and Racah matrices acquire a relatively universal form in the quasiclassical limit, where the basic reshufflings with the change of moduli are those of the Stokes line. Natural {{from this point of view}} are matrices provided by the modular transformations of conformal blocks (with the usual identification R = T and U = S), and in the simplest case of the first degenerate field (2, 1), when the conformal blocks satisfy a second order Shrödinger-like equation, the invariants coincide with the Jones (N = 2) invariants of the associated knots. Another possibility to construct knot invariants is to realize the cluster coordinates associated with reshufflings of the Stokes lines immediately in terms of check-operators acting on the solutions to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. Then, the R-matrices are realized as products of successive mutations in the cluster algebra and are manifestly described in terms of quantum dilogarithms ultimately leading to the Hikami construction of knot invariants...|$|E

40|$|Much of transiting {{exoplanet}} science {{relies on}} high-precision photometry. The {{current generation of}} instruments can exhibit sensitivity variations greater than the astrophysical signals. For the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope, a popular way to handle this is BiLinearly-Interpolated Subpixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping. As part of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), BLISS mapping estimates the sensitivity at many locations (knots) on the pixel, then interpolates to the target star's centroids. We show that such embedded optimization schemes can misfit or bias parameters. Thus, we construct a model of Spitzer eclipse light curves to test the accuracy and precision of BLISS mapping. We compare standard BLISS mapping to a variant where the knots are fit during the MCMC, {{as well as to}} a polynomial model. Both types of BLISS mapping give similar eclipse depths, and we find that <b>standard</b> <b>knots</b> behave like real parameters. Standard BLISS mapping is therefore a reasonable shortcut to fitting for knots in an MCMC. BLISS maps become inaccurate when the photon noise is low, but typically approximate the real sensitivity well. We also find there is no perfect method for choosing the ideal number of BLISS knots to use on given data. BLISS mapping gives fits that are usually more accurate than precise (i. e. they are overly conservative), and the routine is more precise than polynomial models for significant eclipses or pixels with more varied sensitivities. BLISS mapping has better predictive power for most of these particular synthetic data, depending on how one treats time-correlated residuals. Overall, we conclude that BLISS mapping can be a reasonable sensitivity model for IRAC photometry. Comment: 32 pages, 13 figures; Accepted by PASP 9 / 26 / 16.

The Korean Standard (KS) confines outermost lamina of glulam to higher grade than E 8, but the yield of higher than grade E 8 from logs is only 6. 5 %. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of non-Korean-Standard glulam in structural applications. Allowable stresses determined by both hand-calculation and Monte-Carlo simulation show a higher allowable stress than that of the KS-standard glulam of 6 S- 22 B. In the Korean <b>Standard</b> (KS), <b>knot</b> characteristics are not taken into account. Japanese cedar has relatively small knots.

Continuous observations of water temperature, current speed and direction were obtained over periods ranging from 5 hours to 162 hours using an in situ Savonius rotor current measuring system. Basic statistical parameters and power spectra were calculated for each record. These revealed an average current speed of about 0. 23 <b>knot</b> (<b>standard</b> deviation of 0. 17 knot), and a current direction which indicates flow reversals predominantly along the canyon axis.

Two consequences of the topological structure are important: the classical expression for the difference between the numbers of right handed and left handed photons is equal to n + m, having thus a topological interpretation, and the electric charge is quantized, the fundamental value being close to 14 / 3 times de electron charge...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} and complications of eyelid margin closure with 7 / 0 Vicryl or Vicryl Rapide suture with a buried knot at the grey line and to compare this with standard closure using silk with an external knot. METHODS: Analysis of a prospective, non-comparative, interventional case series using 7 / 0 Vicryl or Vicryl Rapide with a buried grey-line knot (modified lid margin closure). Detailed assessment during the healing period {{was directed to}} (1) the lid margin profile, (2) the grey line suture and (3) the tissue reaction. Patients were seen for assessment within two days following surgery, at 14 days and at two months. A retrospective, comparative series of silk with an external <b>knot</b> (<b>standard</b> lid margin closure) and 7 / 0 Vicryl or Vicryl Rapide (modified lid margin closure) was also studied. An analysis {{was made of the}} hospital records of patients who had undergone direct lid margin closure with 7 / 0 Vicryl, Vicryl Rapide or silk. Short- and long-term complications were noted. RESULTS: The prospective series included 24 patients whose lid margin closure had been performed with the modified technique with 7 / 0 Vicryl or 7 / 0 Vicryl Rapide. All lids healed well and {{there was no difference between}} these two sutures. The retrospective series included 123 patients.

The Double SB repair with a mean failure load of 456. 9 N was significantly stronger than the Untied SB with Pushlocks repair at 300 N (P = 0. 023), the standard SB repair at 295 N (P = 0. 019), and lastly the Untied SB with FT repair at 284 N (P = 0. 011). No differences were detected between the two mattress stitch standard SB repair with knots and the knotless two mattress stitch repairs (Untied SB with FT and Untied SB with Pushlocks). Gaps developed during cyclic loading in all repairs apart from the Double SB repair.

40|$|Laparoscopic partial {{nephrectomy}} (LPN) is {{an effective}} surgical procedure to remove a small renal tumor, while preserving {{the remainder of the}} kidney. However, it is a technically challenging procedure to maintain hemostatic condition on the kidney during LPN suturing. Three different experiments were conducted to explore the characteristics and limitations of the current mechanism for tissue approximation during LPN procedures. During the first experiment, a standard suture anchor Hem-o-lok device, a <b>standard</b> stop <b>knot,</b> and three prototype devices were compared to each other based on the amount of tension that could be placed on a suture before there was a tear in renal tissue. The renal remnant of a standardized defect in porcine kidneys without an intact renal capsule was sutured using Vicryl 2 - 0 suture and different suture anchors. The approximate mean tensions at which the renal parenchymal tissue failed using these tested anchors was knots (2. 7 N ± 0. 53 N), Prototype 2 (4. 0 N± 1. 6 N), Hem-o-lok (5. 4 N± 0. 72 N), Prototype 1 (5. 6 N± 0. 75 N), and Prototype 3 (6. 0 N± 3. 39 N). Even with a small number of tests (8 for most configurations), there are significant differences at the 95 % confidence level. Statistical analysis of the data, however, indicates that there is no significant difference between anchors Hem-o-lok, Prototype 1 and Prototype 3 with a significance level of 0. 05. The second experiment was conducted to determine if different types and sizes of absorbable suture used in partial nephrectomy can sustain a tension of 4 N over a 21 day period, which is necessary to achieve hemostasis in the perfused kidney. The results indicate that the sutures commonly used in LPN, i. e. Vicryl 2 - 0 and Vicryl 3 - 0 do not break within the 21 day expected life and that failure of other sutures tested before 7 days is commonly due to knot slippage. The final experiment measured and compared the holding strength of a common technique used in LPN surgery to provide anchoring of a suture, a Hem-o-lok device backstopped with a LAPRA-TY. Suture types Vicryl, Monocryl, Chromic, Stratafix and V-Loc were tested in common sizes. The results show that the holding strength of clips (Hem-o-Lok backstopped by LAPRA-TY) for Vicryl 4 - 0 sutures is the lowest of all types and sizes tested at a mean value of 4. 2 N± 1. 36 N and maximum for V-Loc 2 - 0 sutures at the mean value of 15. 9 N± 2. 58 N. The clips hold maximum tension for suture sizes “ 1 ” and “ 0 ”, whereas minimum tension for suture size 4 - 0. This experiment indicates that the holding ability of these clips support the application of suture tension greater than 5. 5 N thought to be necessary for adequate hemostasis following LPN. However, suture types Vicryl 3 - 0 and Vicryl 4 - 0 {{may not be able to}} maintain hemostatic condition during LPN when used with this anchor method...|$|R
