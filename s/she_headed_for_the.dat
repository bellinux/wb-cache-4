5|$|After refit {{work was}} {{completed}} on 31 March 1942, Colorado carried out extensive training maneuvers along the West Coast, {{before returning to}} Pearl Harbor to complete her final preparations for action. She operated {{in the vicinity of}} the Fiji Islands and New Hebrides from 8 November 1942 to 17 September 1943 to prevent any further Japanese expansion in the Pacific. She sailed from Pearl Harbor on 21 October 1943 to provide pre-invasion shelling and fire support for the invasion of Tarawa, returning to port on 7 December 1943. After another overhaul on the West Coast, Colorado returned to Lahaina Roads, in the Hawaiian Islands, on 21 January 1944 and sortied the next day for the Marshall Islands. She provided the pre-invasion bombardment and fire support for the invasions of Kwajalein and Eniwetok until 23 February, when <b>she</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Puget Sound Navy Yard for another overhaul.|$|E
25|$|Following voyage repairs, she {{continued}} across the Pacific {{and arrived at}} Pearl Harbor on 18 December 1945. Thirteen days later, <b>she</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> California coast and arrived at San Francisco, on 10 January 1946.|$|E

This wind favours us on both legs; and it's lucky it does, for't will be hard on upon daylight afore we are alongside of her. You'll want {{half an hour of}} dark, at the very least, to get a good start of the Swash, in case she makes sail a'ter you." ...|$|R
50|$|A rape victim, {{comic book}} artist Lisa Roberts {{is given the}} {{runaround}} by the New York City Police Department. Tired with city life, <b>she</b> <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wide open spaces of Arizona. Not long afterward, she is propositioned by lowlife Randall Atkins. She reports this to sympathetic local policeman Steve Smith, who replies matter-of-factly {{that this is not}} the first time that Atkins has been accused of a sexual offense.|$|R
25|$|Harder reconnoitered Tawi-Tawi {{anchorage}} 11 June and sighted additional enemy cruisers and destroyers. At 16:00 <b>she</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{open sea}} {{and that night}} transmitted her observations which were of vital importance to Admiral Raymond A. Spruance's fleet prior to the decisive Battle of the Philippine Sea. Harder steamed to Darwin on 21 June for additional torpedoes, and, after patrolling the Flores Sea south of the Celebes Islands (with Admiral Ralph Christie aboard), she ended the patrol at Darwin on 3 July.|$|E
25|$|<b>She</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> western Caroline Islands {{where she}} was {{assigned}} duty as lifeguard ship for downed aviators. During American air strikes against Woleai on 1 April, Harder received word of an injured pilot awaiting rescue from the beach of a small enemy-held island west of Woleai. Protected by air cover, she nosed against a reef, maintained her position with both propellers, and sent a boat ashore through breaking surf. Despite Japanese snipers, boiling shoals, and the precarious position of the submarine, the daring rescue succeeded, and the intrepid submarine returned to the open sea.|$|E
25|$|She {{arrived at}} Melbourne, Australia, on 1 February 1944 and {{operated}} in Australian waters {{for the next}} three months; visiting the ports of Sydney, Fremantle, and Brisbane as a unit of the U.S. 7th Fleet. At the end of April 1944, the ship was reassigned to the U.S. 3rd Fleet and moved to Nouméa, New Caledonia. On 4 June 1944, she returned to 7th Fleet at Milne Bay, New Guinea, to prepare for the landings on Noemfoor Island and at Cape Sansapor, both of which she supported in July 1944. In August 1944, she was underway to the South Pacific for duty in the Solomon and New Hebrides Islands. That assignment lasted until February 1945 when <b>she</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Marianas and service in support of the U.S. 5th Fleet.|$|E
50|$|<b>She</b> then <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean via the gap {{separating}} the Faroe and Shetland Islands. She arrived at St. Nazaire in occupied France, on 28 January 1942.|$|R
50|$|The U-boat left Kiel {{once more}} on 6 October 1942, {{but this time}} <b>she</b> was <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean, via the gap {{separating}} the Faroe and Shetland Islands.|$|R
50|$|The boat {{departed}} Kiel on 10 April 1943, {{moved through}} the North Sea, negotiated the gap between Iceland and the Faroe Islands and entered the Atlantic Ocean. <b>She</b> was <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> French Atlantic ports.|$|R
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of June, the ship proceeded to its next assignment—as visit ship at Annapolis, Maryland during the Naval Academy's June Week. She returned to Little Creek on 8 June and resumed local duty {{until the end of}} the month. On the 30 June, the ship headed up Chesapeake Bay once again, this time ascending the Potomac River to Washington, D. C. That weekend the ship moored at the Washington Navy Yard, where she hosted a throng of visitors ship during the Independence Day holiday. After returning to Little Creek on 5 July, Barnstable County embarked Marine Corps reservists later in the week for a training exercise at Onslow Beach on the North Carolina coast. The exercise began on 11 July and continued through 19 July. She carried out two more reserve training landings at Little Creek's Anzio Beach during the last week of July and the first week in August. On 10 August, <b>she</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> West Indies once more to serve as a launch platform for target drone missiles. Barnstable County made a three-day port visit at Nassau in the Bahamas before picking up the drones at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. After the exercise, she spent several days in St. Thomas, and then steamed back to Little Creek.|$|E
500|$|On 24 May 1941, the Battle of the Denmark Strait {{was fought}} between the German ships [...] and [...] and the British ships [...] and [...] Hood was sunk and the damaged Prince of Wales {{was forced to}} retire. Bismarck, also damaged, ordered her consort to proceed {{independently}} while <b>she</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> French port of St Nazaire, which was the only port on the Atlantic coast with a dry dock able to accommodate a ship of her size. She was intercepted by the British and sunk en route.|$|E
2500|$|Nautilus {{returned}} to New London, Connecticut, on 21 July and departed again on 19 August {{for her first}} voyage of [...] under polar pack ice. Thereafter, <b>she</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Atlantic to participate in NATO exercises and conduct a tour of various British and French ports where she was inspected by defense personnel of those countries. She arrived back at New London on 28 October, underwent upkeep, and then conducted coastal operations until the spring.|$|E
50|$|The song {{received}} a big-budget video, directed by Jeff Richter. Based on elements from The Wiz and The Wizard of Oz, a woman (played by Rah Digga) stiffs a cab driver (played by Posdnuos) {{out of a}} tip for a $27.00 ride (some versions of this video cut out the cab ride part for time reasons). When <b>she</b> <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{front of the line}} to the dance club Brick City, the doorman (played by Dave Chappelle in a character similar to Sir Smoke-a-Lot from Half Baked) denies her entrance because he doesn't see her name on the list.|$|R
50|$|Two {{other school}} girls, Aura and Aphrodesia, {{talk about the}} new girl while {{preparing}} for gym class. However, they are interrupted by a body falling out of a locker. Meanwhile, Xander returns Buffy's stake. Xander then gives Buffy {{a tour of the}} school. Willow approaches Buffy and Xander, troubled. She explains about the body in the locker. Once Cordelia confirms the news, Buffy runs off. She meets Principal Flutie when he is coming out of the girl's locker room and asks to see the body. When she finds the two holes in <b>the</b> neck, <b>she</b> <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> library.|$|R

2500|$|As {{it turned}} out, Washington would not {{participate}} in active combat in the Pacific theater again. Her final wartime refit carried on through V-J Day in mid-August 1945 and the formal Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay on 2 September. She completed her post-repair trials and conducted underway training out of San Pedro, California, before <b>she</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Panama Canal {{to return to the}} Atlantic Ocean. Joining TG 11.6 on 6 October, with Vice Admiral Frederick C. Sherman in overall command, she soon transited the Panama Canal and headed for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the place where she had been [...] "born." [...] Arriving at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 17 October, she participated in Navy Day ceremonies there on 27 October.|$|E
2500|$|After {{making it}} safely through the complex tides and {{channels}} of Southampton Water and the Solent, Titanic headed {{out into the}} English Channel. <b>She</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> French port of Cherbourg, a journey of [...] The weather was windy, very fine but cold and overcast. Because Cherbourg lacked docking facilities for a ship the size of Titanic, tenders had {{to be used to}} transfer passengers from shore to ship. The White Star Line operated two at Cherbourg, the [...] and the [...] Both had been designed specifically as tenders for the Olympic-class liners and were launched shortly after Titanic. (Nomadic is today the only White Star Line ship still afloat.) Four hours after Titanic left Southampton, she arrived at Cherbourg and was met by the tenders. 274 additional passengers were taken aboard, 142 First Class, 30 Second Class, and 102 Third Class. Twenty-four passengers who had booked passage only cross-channel from Southampton left aboard the tenders to be conveyed to shore. The process was completed within only 90 minutes and at 8p.m. Titanic weighed anchor and left for Queenstown with the weather continuing cold and windy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{submarine}} {{began her}} ninth patrol on 3 May when <b>she</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Yellow Sea to patrol in a wolfpack with , , and [...] Targets were scarce and mechanical difficulties plagued Balao. On 19 May, the submarine attacked a small freighter, but {{all three of}} the torpedoes that she fired missed the target. Nevertheless, she did win a consolation prize when one of her torpedoes struck and sank a nearby 30-ton junk. On 23 May, Balaos earlier mechanical difficulties rendered her stern diving planes totally inoperable, and she received orders to Pearl Harbor for refit. En route, she embarked a sailor from [...] suffering from appendicitis and an injured [...] crewman. Later that evening, although the radar scope was clear and no other submarines were known to be in the vicinity, Balao was suddenly attacked by torpedoes. The quick reactions of the officer of the deck caused two to pass to port and two to starboard. The submarine continued on to Midway where she arrived on 3 June, discharged her passengers, and set a course for Pearl Harbor where she arrived four days later.|$|E

50|$|Janice is in denim {{overalls}} and a plaid flannel shirt and forcefully barges {{her way into}} the meal, silencing the spiteful Trina by shoving a bite of chicken into her mouth, having already thrown Mike from his chair at the table. Janice reveals she met Troy when his vehicle broke down and she brought him out to the cabin, her truck driving route being along the way. Trina disgustedly calls her a lesbian much to Diana's chagrin and Janice's anger. Janice playfully threatens her as Troy returns greeting her warmly. Janice takes her food and after smacking Trina on the butt feigning interest in her, <b>she</b> <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> door taunting Trina before leaving.|$|R
60|$|At {{last one}} day a {{schooner}} rather bigger than themselves was sighted. Her appearance was rakish, and there was little doubt as to her character. All sail was at once crowded on L’Agile. The schooner was nearly {{as fast as she}} was, {{and at the end of}} a six hours’ chase she was still two miles ahead. Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> shore and disappeared among the trees. L’Agile proceeded on her course until opposite the mouth of the inlet which the pirate had entered. It was getting dark, and Will decided to wait until morning, and then to send a boat in to reconnoitre.|$|E
60|$|Joan {{was ashamed}} {{that she could}} feel insulted. She was amazed at the temper which seemed roused in her. This border had caused her {{feelings}} she had never dreamed possible to her. Avoiding the trail, <b>she</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{other side of the}} gulch. There were clumps of willows along the brook through which she threaded a way, looking for a good place to cross. The horse snorted for water. Apparently {{she was not going to}} find any better crossing, so she turned the horse into a narrow lane through the willows and, dismounting on a mossy bank, she slipped the bridle so the horse could drink.|$|E
60|$|John Bumpus {{raised his}} bulky form {{with a degree}} of lithe {{activity}} that proved him to be not less agile than athletic, and, with several others, sprang to obey the order. A few seconds later, the sails were swelled out by a light breeze, and the schooner moved through the water at a rate which seemed scarcely possible under the influence of so gentle a puff of air. Presently the breeze increased, the vessel cut through the blue water like a knife, leaving a long track of foam in her wake as <b>she</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> coral-island before referred to. The outer reef, or barrier of coral which guarded the island, was soon reached. The narrow opening in this natural bulwark was passed. The schooner stood across the belt of perfectly still water that lay between the reef and the shore, and entered a small bay, where the calm water reflected the strip of white sand, green palms, and tropical plants that skirted its margin, as well as the purple hills of the interior.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> {{raised her}} <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time and}} looked at him, with her lips quivering. But she did not speak.|$|R

6000|$|I cantered after Edith Copleigh, {{thinking}} {{to bring her}} back slowly on some pretence or another. But she galloped away as soon as she saw me, and I was forced to ride after her in earnest. She called back over her shoulder--"Go away! I'm going home. Oh, go away!" [...] two or three times; but my business was to catch her first, and argue later. The ride just fitted in {{with the rest of the}} evil dream. The ground was very bad, and now and again we rushed through the whirling, choking [...] "dust-devils" [...] in the skirts of the flying storm. There was a burning hot wind blowing that brought up a stench of stale brick-kilns with it; and through the half light and through the dust-devils, across that desolate plain, flickered the brown holland habit on the gray horse. <b>She</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Station at first. Then she wheeled round and set off for the river through beds of burnt down jungle-grass, bad even to ride a pig over. In cold blood I should never have dreamed of going over such a country at night, but it seemed quite right and natural with the lightning crackling overhead, and a reek like the smell of the Pit in my nostrils. I rode and shouted, and she bent forward and lashed her horse, and the aftermath of the dust-storm came up and caught us both, and drove us downwind like pieces of paper.|$|E
