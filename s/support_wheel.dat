40|$|O estudo das tensões em colhedoras de forragens é imprescindível, uma vez que as condições de operação são muito variáveis e severas. Utilizou-se um sistema "datalogger" devidamente calibrado para medir as tensões, em função do tempo, numa colhedora de forragem. Foram desenvolvidos modelos matemáticos para obter a variação periódica dessas tensões, considerando-se a influência da roda de apoio e da velocidade angular do rotor de corte. O ajuste dos modelos foi verificado pelo coeficiente de determinação (R²). A variação periódica das tensões, em função do tempo, para os valores experimentais e teóricos, foi representada graficamente, utilizando-se da planilha eletrônica EXCEL. Observou-se que as menores amplitudes de tensões e os maiores períodos do ciclo corresponderam aos tratamentos que utilizaram a roda de apoio. A análise estatística mostrou que a velocidade angular do rotor de corte apresentou diferença significativa, {{conforme}} o Teste de Tukey, para 5 %. Com base nos resultados obtidos, concluiu-se que os ciclos de tensões em colhedoras de forragens podem ser representados com bom ajuste por funções senoidais e que o uso da roda de apoio pode aumentar o tempo de serviço da colhedora. The {{study of}} stress in forage harvester is necessary, because the operation conditions are very different and rigorous. A calibrated datalogger system {{was used to measure}} the stress as function of time for a forage harvester. Mathematical models were developed to obtain the periodical variation of this stress by considering the influence of <b>support</b> <b>wheel</b> and the angular velocity of cutterheads. The agreement of these models was verified by the determination coefficient (R²). The periodical variation of stress as function of time for both experimental and theoretical values was graphically represented by using of the software EXCEL. It was observed that the minimal amplitude stress and the maximal periods of cycle corresponded to the treatments employed, which utilized the <b>support</b> <b>wheel.</b> The statistical analysis showed that the angular velocity of cutterheads presented significant difference, according to the Tukey Test for 5 %.

40|$|Abstract: Well-built and {{maintained}} highways {{play a major}} role in nation’s development. The subgrade soil is integral part of pavements which provides support to the pavement. The subgrade soil and its properties are important in the design of pavement structure. Expansive soils are those soils, which have high swelling and shrinkage characteristics, extremely low CBR value and shear strength. The soil of Kuttanad region of Alappuzha district of Kerala in India is example of expansive soil entirely different from the normal well drained soils in their morphological, chemical and physical characteristics. Thus construction of roadbeds on or with these soils, which do not possess sufficient strength to <b>support</b> <b>wheel</b> loads imposed upon them either during construction or during the service life of the pavement is a commonly encountered problem.

40|$|Abstract. To {{avoid the}} open {{problems}} of the leading wheel and get a more rational structure, the paper uses PRO / E and the finite element software to analyze the leading wheel of JKM- 3. 25 / 4 multi-rope friction hoist. The results show that in the leading wheel the rib plates between the channel steel and wheel hub are removed or added the same ones will have {{little effect on the}} overall force situation, and only affect the stress of the weld bead. To solve the problem of open weld of rib plates, can consider the rib plates to be removed. When the radial angle between <b>support</b> <b>wheel</b> and drum is bigger than 6 °, the overall force of the leading wheel is affected seriously. But when the radial angle is 5 °, the amplitude of stress fluctuation is the minimum, which can improve the leading wheel working conditions and increase the service life of the leading wheel. Therefore the suggestion is to take the radial angle of 5 ° when to design the new multi-rope hoist. Study conclusions provide the theoretical supports for the leading wheel of multi-rope friction design and technical renovation...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} an improved rig for the dynamic calibration of skinfold calipers. The new unit is 5 % lighter and almost 60 % smaller {{than its predecessor}} (Carlyon et al., 1996, 1998) with a 9. 5 mm solid aluminium base and a quick release caliper mount providing stability to both the rig and caliper. Automation of the gap controller {{with an electric motor}} standardizes the jaw opening and closing velocity, thereby enabling hands-free operation. Frictional losses in the moving components of the rig have been reduced by replacing the main bush of the swing arm with a bearing, reducing the mass of the swing arm, adding a <b>support</b> <b>wheel</b> {{to the end of the}} swing arm, and replacing fishing swivels with a universal joint to allow for changes in the opening screw angle as the caliper's arm moves through its arc. This rig can also be adapted to different types of calipers by changing the position of the load cell, microswitches, and the caliper mount. A universal mounting bracket that can be secured to almost any table supports the rig in a vertical plane when calibrating the load cell. To demonstrate the versatility of the calibration rig, preliminary data are presented for the upscale and downscale jaw pressures of seven Harpenden and seven Slim Guide calipers. G. B. Hewitt, R. T.

Practical recommendation •	Summer dock treatment is especially worthwhile in dry summers with catch crop cultivation and after early maturing crops (winter barley, whole-crop silage) or with an early tillage of grass-clover. •	After grass-clover lay or cereal harvest, undercut the dock plants at a depth of 12 - 15 cm with a skim plough (without skimmer) with a <b>support</b> <b>wheel,</b> a stubble cleaner or an overlapping flat cultivator. •	Bring the roots to the surface by passing over the field with a spring-tine harrow every 7 - 14 days. Additionally, apply a rotary harrow in heavy soils to expose the roots. •	After every round, collect roots manually or let them dry in suitable weather conditions. Only leave fully dead roots on the field. Information •	Plan deep-rooted crops and annual or perennial cover crops in the crop rotation {{in order to reduce the}} water and nutrient supply in deeper soil layers and thus impair the growth conditions for dock plants. •	After a short dock treatment sow a suitable catch crop as quickly as possible, and only leave the field fallow until autumn sowing of cereals, if you intend to perform a longer treatment. •	If the dock pressure is high, refrain from sowing 4 -year, slowly growing mixtures...|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of the three onion harvesting machines, including Onion Shallow Digging Harvester, Clipping-up Type Onion Harvester and The Direction-adjusted Onion Harvester. For the need of the design considerations, the field investigation was conducted to survey the types of planting onions and the physical properties of onion. This information is important for the design of the onion harvesting machine. The onion shallow digging harvester is composed of unites such as arc-shape designed shallow digger, arc shape discharge port, <b>support</b> <b>wheel,</b> disc type knife and swing mechanism. As a result of the field test, no obstruction of the discharge port or covering of the onion balls by dirt was observed and the grass had not hanged up on the digger supporters. An onion which slides into the bed ditch is 0. 24 % on an average; the highest probability under the standard normal distribution is 0. 6 %. The average of damage is 0. 1 %, while the highest rate under the standard normal distribution is 0. 37 %, and the residual root length of onion bulbs among 93. 3 % in standard normal distribution is less than 2. 5 cm and meets the market demand. The field tests showed that the operation capacity of the onion shallow digging harvester is 2. 77 ha/day(8 hr) for five rows per bed and 3. 29 ha/day(8 hr) for six rows per bed. The clipping-up type onion harvester is possessed of functions such as lifting up the onion sheath, cutting off the onion root, shallowly digging the onion bulbs, clipping the onion plants, leveling the onion bulbs and shearing the sheath. In consequence of the indoor tests for this machine, for those onion bulbs with the residual sheath length meeting the market requirement of 1 ～ 3. 5 cm, the rate of standard normal distribution is 97. 35 %, while for those meeting the market requirement of 1 ～ 4. 0 cm market requirement, the rate of standard normal distribution is 99. 8 %. As a result of the field tests, for those onion bulbs with the residual sheath length meeting the market requirement of 1 ～ 3. 5 cm, the rate of standard normal distribution is 94. 8 %, while those meeting the market requirement of 1 ～ 4. 0 cm, the rate is 99. 4 %. The rate of eligibility for the standard normal distribution of those onion bulbs with the root length 3. 0 cm is 98. 5 %. The direction-adjusted type onion harvester is composed of units such as digging, inward distribution, upward delivery, pushing, direction adjustment and shearing. The survey results of indoor tests for this machine are: the longest sheath left behind on the onion bulb is 2. 8 cm, the shortest 1. 0 cm and the mean 2. 02 cm; the rate of eligibility for standard normal distribution meeting the market requirement(1 ～ 3. 5 cm) is 99. 7 %; as a result of the field tests, the longest sheath is 4. 0 cm, the shortest 1. 5 cm and the mean 2. 31 cm with the rate of eligibility for standard normal distribution meeting the market requirement at 96. 8 %, which is 1. 6 % higher than 95. 2 % for the hand shearing. In both the indoor and field tests, no onion is found to have its direction unadjusted. The design priciples and calsulate formulas in this study can be used as basis of the device of the Onion Shallow Digging Harvester, Clipping-up Type Onion Harvester ans Diredtion-asjusted Type Onion Harvester. 本論文旨在研發洋蔥收穫機，包括洋蔥淺挖機、夾起式洋蔥收穫機及整向式洋蔥收穫機等三種收穫機械。首先調查洋蔥栽培方式、洋蔥物性作為研發的依據。 本研究設計完成之洋蔥淺挖機具有弧形淺挖刀、弧形排出口、支撐輪、圓盤刀及擺動機構等部份。田間試驗結果，未發現有排出口阻塞、蔥球被土壤覆蓋及支柱纏草等現象。洋蔥滑落畦溝者平均 0. 24 %，在常態分佈下的機率最高為 0. 6 %。損傷率平均為 0. 1 %，在常態分佈下的機率最高為 0. 37 %，被挖洋蔥殘留根長合乎市場需求 2. 5 cm者，其常態分佈機率為 93. 3 %。田間作業能量試驗結果：一畦五行式 2. 77 ha/day (8 hr) ，一畦六行式 3. 29 ha/day (8 hr) 。 夾起式洋蔥收穫機具有扶起蔥葉、切斷蔥根、挖起蔥球、夾送蔥株、齊高蔥球及切斷鞘葉等功能。室內實驗結果，殘留在蔥球上的鞘葉長度，符合市場需求的 1 ~ 3. 5 cm者，其常態分佈機率為 97. 35 %，符合 1 ~ 4. 0 cm者為 99. 8 %。田間試驗結果，殘留在蔥球上的鞘葉長度符合市場需求的 1 ~ 3. 5 cm者，其常態分佈機率為 94. 8 %，符合 1 ~ 4. 0 cm者為 99. 4 %；留在蔥球上的根長在 3. 0 cm者之常態分佈合格率為 98. 5 %。 整向式洋蔥收穫機具有挖掘、撥入、上送、推送、整向及剪切等功能。室內試驗結果，殘留在蔥球上的鞘葉最長者為 2. 8 cm、最短者為 1. 0 cm、平均為 2. 02 cm，符合市場需求 1 ~ 3. 5 cm的常態分佈合格機率為 99. 7 %；田間試驗結果，最長者為 4. 0 cm、最短者為 1. 5 cm、平均為 2. 31 cm，符合市場需求的常態分佈合格機率為 96. 8 %，比人工剪切的 95. 2 %多 1. 6 %。在室內及田間試驗時，未發現有未整向的洋蔥。 本研究的設計理論與公式，可分別做為洋蔥淺挖機、夾起式洋蔥收穫機及整向式洋蔥收穫機的設計依據。謝誌	I 摘要	II Abstract	III 目錄	V 表目錄	VIII 圖目錄	.

The inadequate roll control was not greatly improved, retaining the wing warping of the Gastambide-Mengin. Ground handling and take-off / landing performance was improved, however, by revising the complex inadequate quadricycle undercarriage of the Gastambide-Mengin, with strut <b>supported</b> <b>wheels</b> forward and aft on the centre-line and side-by-side wheels midway between the singles.

The hands-free input device of the invention, which includes the position detection assembly and a position detection device, provides input signals representative of desired wheelchair movements to the controller. The position detection device detects the position of the seat. Movement of the seat, rather than a joystick, creates the voltage signals which are then transmitted to the wheelchair controller...|$|R
40|$|Loading margin is a {{fundamental}} measure of proximity to voltage collapse. Linear and quadratic estimates to the variation of the loading margin with respect to any system parameter or control are derived. Tests with a 118 bus system indicate that the estimates accurately predict the quantitative effect on the loading margin of altering the system loading, reactive power <b>support,</b> <b>wheeling,</b> load model parameters, line susceptance, and generator dispatch. The accuracy of the estimates over a useful range and the ease of obtaining the linear estimate suggest that this method will be of practical value in avoiding voltage collapse.

Particular attention was paid to the problem of 'friction' caused by magnetic and I to the second power R losses in the suspension and motor-generator subsystems, and low design friction levels have been achieved. The potentially long shelf life of this system, and the absence of wearing parts, provide superior performance over conventional flywheels supported with mechanical bearings.
