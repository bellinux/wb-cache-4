50|$|Spats {{remain in}} use today as {{personal}} protective equipment in certain industries. In foundries, pourers wear leather spats over their boots to protect against <b>splashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>molten</b> <b>metal.</b> Even a small splash that lodges in a shoe or between the shoe and ankle could cause a severe burn. Many welders also wear fire-resistant spats for protection from sparks. Casual chainsaw operators often wear protective spats over steel-toe boots, but professionals are now encouraged to wear true chainsaw boots to prevent injury from accidental chainsaw contact with the foot or ankle.|$|R

For {{the determination of the}} fundamental mechanisms underlying the penetration and freezing behavior <b>of</b> <b>molten</b> <b>metal</b> flowing through a seven-pin channel was the main objectives of this study.

Visual information was also obtained by using a digital video camera. The comparison between the atmosphere and the water-coolant experiments shows that characteristics of penetration and freezing behavior will significantly change due to heat transfer from melt to coolant.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} aimed at {{investigating}} the forces responsible for the detachment <b>of</b> <b>molten</b> <b>metal</b> droplets formed at an electrode tip, which imminently and eventually drop into the weld pool during the welding process. The Equations used by Kim and Eagar in 1993 were applied to this study. It {{was found that the}} different detaching forces which are the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force, and the drag force, were determined to be 7. 154 x 10 - 6 N, 0. 05 N and 1. 736 N respectively. Whereas, the primary retaining force, which is the surface tension force, was calculated to be 0. 0195 N. From the findings, since the combination of the detaching forces taken together is greater than the retaining force, detachment <b>of</b> the <b>molten</b> <b>metal</b> droplet must inevitably occur. The combined effect of these forces on the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>molten</b> <b>metal</b> during the droplet detachment process was adequately investigated in this study...|$|R
