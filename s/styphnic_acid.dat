With concentrated nitric acid, {{in the presence}} of cold concentrated sulfuric acid, it yields trinitro-resorcin (<b>styphnic</b> <b>acid),</b> which forms yellow crystals, exploding violently on rapid heating.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Styphnic</b> <b>acid</b> (from Greek stryphnos [...] "{{astringent}}"), or 2,4,6-trinitro-1,3-benzenediol, is {{a yellow}} astringent acid that forms hexagonal crystals. It {{is used in}} the manufacture of dyes, pigments, inks, medicines, and explosives such as lead styphnate. It is itself a low sensitivity explosive, similar to picric acid, but explodes upon rapid heating.|$|E
5000|$|Lead styphnate (lead 2,4,6-trinitroresorcinate, C6HN3O8Pb [...] ), {{whose name}} is derived from <b>styphnic</b> <b>acid,</b> is an {{explosive}} used as a component in primer and detonator mixtures for less sensitive secondary explosives. Lead styphnate is only slightly soluble in water and methanol Samples of lead styphnate vary in color from yellow to gold, orange, reddish-brown, to brown. Lead styphnate is known in various polymorphs, hydrates, and basic salts. Normal lead styphnate monohydrate, monobasic lead styphnate, tribasic lead styphnate dihydrate, and pentabasic lead styphnate dehydrate as well as α, β polymorphs of lead styphnate exist.|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} preparation and crystal structure of <b>styphnic</b> <b>acid</b> and naphthalene- 1, 4 -diol (1 [*]:[*] 1) (I) have been reported. The compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic system in space group Pnma and cell parameters a= 6. 6712 (2), b= 16. 8267 (7), c= 13. 6450 (5) [*]Å and V= 1531. 71 (10) [*]Å 3, and Z= 4. Crystal structure {{has been determined}} and refined to R= 0. 0576. The crystal structure of I, the asymmetric unit, contains C 6 H 2 N 3 O 7, C 10 H 7 O, {{and it is a}} half portion of both <b>styphnic</b> <b>acid</b> and naphthalene- 1, 4 -diol. The O 1 –H 1 ⋯O 2 intramolecular hydrogen bond was found between the O–H and a nitro group in the <b>styphnic</b> <b>acid</b> unit...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this work was to {{determine}} the enzyme kinetics for Pseudomonas species lipase catalyzed hydrolysis of substrate 4 -nitrophenyl butyrate in the presence of nitro compounds such as nitroglycerin, 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), picric acid, <b>styphnic</b> <b>acid,</b> hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitrotriazocine (RDX), octahydro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetranitrotriazocine (HMX) and hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (HNIW) in vitro. Kinetically, picric acid and <b>styphnic</b> <b>acid</b> were the mixed-type inhibitors but TNT, RDX and HNIW were the essential activators of the enzyme {{in the presence of a}} detergent triton-X 100. Interestingly, HMX and nitroglycerin were neither an inhibitor nor an activator of the enzyme. From chemical structure point of view, hydrophilic nitro compounds such as picric acid and <b>styphnic</b> <b>acid</b> are capable to enter, the hydrophilic active site of lipase and become inhibitors of the enzyme, while hydrophobic nitro compounds such as TNT, RDX and HNIW presumably mix with Triton-X- 100 and bind to the co-lipase binding site of the enzyme and become the essential activators of the enzyme...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} enthalpies of {{formation of}} 2, 4 -dihydroxy- 1. 3. 5 -trinitrobenzene (<b>styphnic</b> <b>acid),</b> 2, 4 -dihydroxy- 3. 5 -dinitrobenzene (4, 6 -DNR), 2, 4 -dihydroxy-l, 5 -dinitrobenzene (2, 4 -DNR), 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene (two crystal forms) have been determined by oxygen static bomb calorimetry. An isoperibol solution reaction calorimeter has been constructed. By {{the determination of}} various enthalpies of reaction and solution, the enthalpies of formation of various synthesised polymorphs of lead styphnate, lead 2, 4 -dinitroresorcinol, and lead 4, 6 -dinitroresorcinol, thallous styphnate and barium styphnate were found. From these data, enthalpies of decomposition were calculated. By use of a group additivity scheme for solids, the enthalpies of formation for a further five lead polynitroresorcinols was determined. The integral enthalpy of solution for lead nitrate was determined. A differential enthalpy of solution for lead nitrate was determined and an activity correction applied. The enthalpy of transition between the two crystal forms of 2. 6 -dinitrotoluene was determined and heat capacities of the respective forms in the solid and liquid phase measured. Powder X-ray crystallographic study of the two forms was made. <p...|$|E
