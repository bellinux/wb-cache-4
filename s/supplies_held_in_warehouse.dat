50|$|The River Severn {{was a major}} {{transport}} route, especially {{before the}} building of the railway. Severn trows were used to bring raw materials to the forges of the Gorge and to take the finished goods away. At this time, before the management of the river by weirs, water levels in the Severn were highly seasonal. During the summer the river was too low to be navigable and so finished goods were <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>warehouses</b> until there was once again enough water for passage.|$|R
50|$|The {{approximately}} twenty shows {{curated by}} BANK included {{the work of}} the BANK artists alongside the work of several future Turner Prize nominees and winners. Although the BANK exhibitions were mostly <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>warehouse</b> spaces on Curtain Road, then Underwood Street (both Shoreditch, London) the name of the gallery changed. Initially it was BANKSPACE, then DOG, and finally Gallerie Poo-Poo. The various artworks were bound together, via polemical mailouts, deliberately overt thematizing and radically non-hierarchical methods of display, within single sprawling installations with a penchant for what then seemed like visual vulgarity.|$|R
50|$|Besides the Savannah River, and {{its tributaries}} the Tugaloo River and Chattooga River (which also form the state line), the other major rivers are the Chattahoochee River and its {{tributary}} the Chestatee River, which are the headwaters for much of metro Atlanta's water <b>supply,</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> Lake Lanier by Buford Dam. The Oconee River also begins near Athens, and the Little Tennessee River flows north from Rabun county.|$|R
50|$|As well as {{maintaining}} its permanent collection, the museum also organizes periodic exhibitions. ‘LIGHT in Art’ (artificial light, natural light, electric light, metaphysical light), ‘BLACK in art’, a pilot exhibition based on works by Malevic and other artists are exhibitions organized during 2002. The exhibitions ‘Composition and Constructions’ which will refer to international constructivism, and ‘Nikitin and Kliun’ with {{works from the}} Kostaki collection, {{will take place in}} 2003. These exhibitions will be <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>Warehouse</b> B1 on quay one in the city harbour, which functions as the State Museum of Contemporary Art periodic exhibition space.|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of VRS {{assistance}} the HVO gained the upper hand by early July. The UN confirmed that Maglaj was completely surrounded. Around 4,000-5,000 Bosniak POWs and civilians were detained by the HVO {{after the end of}} the battle and <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>warehouses</b> for several days until their release. Captured ARBiH soldiers received harsh treatment. The area of Žepče, Maglaj and Tešanj became a three-sided war. In the Žepče-Zavidovići area the VRS assisted the HVO against the ARBiH, Maglaj was surrounded by the HVO on three sides and the VRS on one side, and in Tešanj the HVO and ARBiH cooperated against the VRS.|$|R
5000|$|... "Barely Legal" [...] was a show by {{graffiti}} artist Banksy, <b>held</b> <b>in</b> {{an industrial}} <b>warehouse</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles, California in 2006. The free show was held {{over the weekend}} of the 16th September 2006.|$|R
25|$|Traditional {{military}} targets had primarily been fielded enemy forces and concentrations of <b>supplies</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> rear areas. After aerial bombardment became a possibility, tactical targets such as communications (supply and signal lines) and troop concentrations {{became the focus}} of bombing efforts. The industrial web theory instead targeted choke points and bottlenecks in an enemy's economic and industrial base, deep inside the interior of an enemy nation. If precision bombing could be used to destroy an industrial node with resulting paralysis of enemy industry, the particular node was given serious consideration as a target.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} stages of the Second Summer of Love, the events and parties were often <b>held</b> <b>in</b> empty <b>warehouses</b> and were {{essentially}} illegal across the UK. Information about these events travelled by word of mouth (as well as the newly popular mobile phone) between clubbers who were obliged to party incognito.|$|R
50|$|At around 18:00 hours, {{when the}} men were all being <b>held</b> <b>in</b> the <b>warehouse,</b> VRS {{soldiers}} threw in hand grenades and shot with various weapons, including rocket propelled grenades. The mass murder in Kravica seemed unplanned and seems to have started spontaneously {{when one of the}} warehouse doors suddenly swung open, according to trial testimony.|$|R
50|$|Wines in bond, {{or simply}} ''''in bond'''', are {{purchased}} wines <b>held</b> <b>in</b> a bonded <b>warehouse,</b> {{which have not}} passed through customs, with no Duty and VAT paid on them.|$|R
50|$|At around 18.00 hours, {{when the}} men were all being <b>held</b> <b>in</b> the <b>warehouse,</b> Serb {{soldiers}} threw in hand grenades and opened fire with various weapons, including rocket propelled grenades. In the local area {{it is said that}} the mass murder in Kravica was unplanned and started quite spontaneously when one of the warehouse doors suddenly swung open.|$|R
50|$|Banksy {{drew the}} artwork over {{three days in}} broad {{daylight}} in 1999. It was drawn in response to various unlicensed raves and parties <b>held</b> <b>in</b> abandoned <b>warehouses</b> around Bristol <b>in</b> the 1990s, that drew increased attention from the police. A specific trigger for the mural was such an event at Winterstoke Road, where riot police began to attack partygoers.|$|R
50|$|A {{referendum}} on grain <b>supply</b> was <b>held</b> <b>in</b> Switzerland on 5 December 1926. Voters {{were asked whether}} they approved of adding article 23 bis to the constitution, which concerned grain supply. The proposal was rejected {{by a majority of}} voters and cantons.|$|R
5000|$|... "Love House" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} acid house singles to appear on {{mainstream}} charts. In 2009, reflecting on the rave era Fox stated, [...] "Of course, I experienced the acid house scene. It actually happened in London at the end of the 80’s and acid house parties were <b>held</b> <b>in</b> disused <b>warehouses</b> that were taken over for one night only." ...|$|R
50|$|Cash <b>supplies</b> are <b>held</b> <b>in</b> a vault or safe. Disbursements and {{acceptance}} of money take place by means of inputting information through a separate computer to the cash dispensing mechanism inside the vault, which is similar in construction to an automatic teller machine vault.|$|R
50|$|The Vendace I was a two-bay biplane with folding wooden {{wings and}} a steel tube fuselage, {{powered by a}} Rolls-Royce Falcon engine.

50|$|In 1967, {{the college}} was officially created {{after two years}} of effort, which {{included}} proposals, approval, and planning. It opened its first temporary office in Oak Lawn, IL. A year later, a contest was held to give the college its name, Moraine Valley Community College. The name was chosen because of its location: “where the Valparaiso and Tinley moraines meet to form a valley.“ Since no campus was yet established, the first classes were <b>held</b> <b>in</b> leased <b>warehouses</b> <b>in</b> Alsip, IL.|$|R
50|$|The {{show was}} watched by {{a total of}} 9 million people, a 17% {{increase}} over 2008's show and the biggest ratings since the 2004 award show. This year was also the first year since 2006 to return to the Radio City Music Hall for the awards and unlike in 2008, where the show was <b>held</b> <b>in</b> a <b>warehouse,</b> this show was at a real venue with a live audience.|$|R
50|$|Submarine and air {{transport}} somewhat eased {{the shortage of}} ammunition and by late October, stocks amounting to 16 days <b>supply</b> were <b>held</b> <b>in</b> forward areas. After six more weeks, the Eighth Army was ready, 195,000 men and 1,029 tanks began the offensive against the 116,000 men and 547 tanks of Panzer Army Africa.|$|R
5000|$|Dutch {{dance music}} record label Mokum Records {{was founded in}} 1993 by Freddy B. Originally {{releasing}} intense gabba music, such a [...] "I'll Show You My Gun" [...] by Annihilator, the label eventually started to release the lighthearted, [...] "hilariously giddy" [...] tone of happy gabba music over the ensuing two to three years. Happy gabba, and its darker originator gabba, {{have been described as}} taking [...] "the sound of Dutch Nineties skinheads who liked their drugs speedy and their music even speedier." [...] The label described the happy gabba music it released as [...] "popcore", and its releases were popular in Dutch underground raves being <b>held</b> <b>in</b> <b>warehouses.</b> After the label had seen international success with [...] "I Wanna Be a Hippy" [...] by Technohead in late 1995 and early 1996, the Make 'Em Mokum Crazy compilation album was conceived by Mokum in attempt to document their catalogue and how the [...] "popcore" [...] sound was transitioning from its underground origins [...] "to the top of the Euro pop charts." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{gas turbine}} fuel oil <b>supplies</b> were <b>held</b> <b>in</b> five {{vertical}} main oil storage tanks, {{with a total}} capacity of 4,440 tonnes - equivalent {{to little more than}} 130 hours continuous generating at full load. Fuel was delivered by rail to the station's own siding located off the Hastings to Ashford Railway line, a few hundred metres north east of Ore Railway Station.|$|R
500|$|As a whole, the oil energy {{industry}} contributes $35 billion to Oklahoma's gross domestic product, and employees of Oklahoma oil-related companies earn {{an average of}} twice the state's typical yearly income. In 2009, the state had 83,700 commercial oil wells churning [...] of crude oil. Eight and a half percent of the nation's natural gas <b>supply</b> is <b>held</b> <b>in</b> Oklahoma, with [...] being produced in 2009.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{receiving}} {{warnings that}} Seyni Kountché was unreliable {{as early as}} 1973, Diori nonetheless promoted him to chief of staff. Besides the drought, the army resented being used for tax collection and other political activities. Shortly before the coup, the Nigerien government signed a mutual defense treaty with Libya which enraged army members. According to Kountché, over 3,000 tons of grain were <b>held</b> <b>in</b> a <b>warehouse</b> waiting for prices to rise, and when he brought the situation to Diori's attention, the president did nothing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mayor of}} Mitrovica {{condemned}} {{the formation of}} a parallel municipal assembly in North Mitrovica by Serbs following the election saying the institution was [...] "illegal" [...] as well as the elections. On June 13, 2008 a parallel assembly with 30 members, the majority from the Serbian Radical Party, was formed for Pristina with the first session being <b>held</b> <b>in</b> a <b>warehouse</b> {{due to a lack of}} space. Radovan Nicic was elected president of the municipality by the assembly. Another assembly was formed in Obilic north of Pristina the same morning.|$|R
40|$|In poor {{countries}} {{there is a}} linkage between lack of safe water, high levels of infections, and high rates of child mortality. To cope with this world-wide problem, the United Nations has launched The International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade 1981 - 90 with health as the overriding objective. Water supply close to the homes will also radically reduce the heavy burden on rural women for which water drawing is a household task. In order that the health objective will be attained, people {{have to use the}} water provided, keep it clean in the home, and keep the water supply system in operation. Water supply and sanitation can no longer be seen as merely technical problems, but involve measures to secure operation and maintenance, manpower, administration, health education, and creation of a sence of public ownership. This book synthesises contributions to and results of the United Nations Seminar on Rural Water <b>Supply</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> Uppsala Sweden, in October 1980...|$|R
5|$|Each race {{relies on}} two {{resources}} {{to sustain their}} game economies and to build their forces: minerals and vespene gas. Minerals are needed for all units and structures, and are obtained by using a worker unit to harvest the resource directly from mineral nodes scattered around the battlefield. Players require vespene gas to construct advanced units and buildings, and acquire it by constructing a gas extraction building {{on top of a}} geyser and using worker units to extract the gas from it. In addition, players need to regulate the supplies for their forces to ensure that they can construct the number of units they need. Although the nature of the supply differs between the races—Terrans use physical <b>supplies</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> depots, Protoss use psionic energy channeled from their homeworld via pylons, and Zerg are regulated by the number of controlling overlord units present—the supply mechanic essentially works {{in exactly the same way}} for each race (just with differing impacts on gameplay), allowing players to create new units when there are sufficient resources to sustain them.|$|R
500|$|The office plays host to a bridal shower for Phyllis Lapin (Phyllis Smith) while Bob Vance's (Robert R. Shafer) {{bachelor}} {{party is}} <b>held</b> <b>in</b> the <b>warehouse.</b> Though Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{is aware that}} the company's sexual harassment policy forbids strippers in the workplace, Todd Packer (David Koechner) convinces him that it is okay to hire a stripper for the bachelor party if he also gets a male stripper for the bridal shower. After Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) admitted to Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) in the previous episode that he still has feelings for Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), interactions between the three become increasingly tense.|$|R
