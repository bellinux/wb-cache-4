500|$|In May 2013, Morrow {{spoke with}} Michael Logan of TV Guide, {{revealing}} {{that the question}} of Summer's paternity would be visited, as Nick's [...] "game-changing deception" [...] would be uncovered. It later revealed onscreen that Summer may in fact not be his daughter; the paternity results read only by Nick years ago were inconclusive. Logan called it [...] "messy development", stating that his character may be [...] "trashed forever". According to Morrow, after Cassie's death, Nick withheld the fact that the results were corrupted because [...] "he just couldn't bear the thought of losing Summer, too", but called it [...] "out of character". [...] "But now he's freaking out because there's a good likelihood that Summer and Kyle are brother and sister," [...] he stated. Nick later secretly does another test using hair from Summer's hairbrush, which comes back conclusive. Later that May, Morrow stated during an interview with TV Buzz that Nick would be devastated by the paternity test outcome; confirming that Summer is in fact Jack's daughter. He stated that Nick is [...] "terrified" [...] of the potential repercussions and the reactions, from Jack, Sharon, Noah, and most importantly Summer. However, months later it was revealed that the paternity test results were actually switched by Nick's ex-wife Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), while she was off her bipolar medication, in a ploy to win Nick back, meaning that he is in fact Summer's biological father after all. Sharon's secret has yet to be revealed. Speaking of the forthcoming reveal, King stated, [...] "I'm very curious as to how they're going to play it out with Summer. I'm sure she's <b>still</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the close bond that she now has with Jack." ...|$|E

5000|$|In May 2013, Nick {{takes a look}} at the {{paternity}} test results from 2006, this time showing viewers that the results were inconclusive. The storyline coincides with the memorial of the death of Nick's daughter, Cassie Newman (Camryn Grimes), and he visits her grave and admits that he is terrified about losing another daughter. Joshua Morrow admitted in an interview with TV Guide that the writers make it clear that Nick did not intend to do anything wrong. He stated that Nick [...] "refused to do another test". Morrow admits that Nick may have never thought about the possibility of Jack being Summer's father again had Summer not fallen so hard for Kyle to point where she admits that she would like to lose her virginity to him. He said that [...] "people don't know what to think" [...] of Nick's [...] "threatening Kyle" [...] and reasons to [...] "ground Summer". On May 27, 2013, Morrow did an interview TV Buzz which confirmed that Summer is indeed Jack's daughter, and according to the actor, Nick is terrified of Summer's reaction. However, months later it was revealed that the {{paternity test}} results were actually switched by Nick's ex-wife Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), while she was off her bipolar medication, in a ploy to win Nick back, meaning that he is in fact Summer's biological father after all. Sharon's secret has yet to be revealed. Speaking of the forthcoming reveal, King stated, [...] "I'm very curious as to how they're going to play it out with Summer.

I'm excited to play it as an actress and to see how it all plays out as a fan. — Hunter King, on Summer's paternity test and Sharon switching the results. In a 2010 interview with TV Guide, Morrow openly discussed his strong belief that Summer was not Nick's child due to the fact that Nick was suffering from amnesia at the time. Though the actor himself questioned Summer's paternity, it seemed nothing would come of his speculation. In October 2012, Bushman hinted that she would not be opposed to a potential romance with Kyle Abbott (then Blake Hood). In February 2013, King's version of Summer is scripted as being 18 years old, and the character has developed a major crush on Kyle. Nick's immediate disapproval hinted that there was more to his disapproval then just the slight age difference between the two characters. Because Nick is the only person to see the test results, many viewers have begun to speculate that Jack could indeed be Summer's biological father. Summer's crush on Kyle reminds them of the possibility that they could be brother and sister. With the installation of Josh Griffith as head writer, in addition to Nick's adamant disapproval of Summer's crush on Kyle, Jack even brings up the night he helped deliver Summer in the elevator. According to Griffith, Nick is so protective because he knows about Jack's playboy history during his younger years. He stated: [...] "Nick's worried that Summer is going to get involved with someone who could break her heart." [...] Despite Griffith's explanation, King herself questioned Summer's paternity; [...] "I ask Josh everyday, 'Whose daughter am I?" [...] Though Griffith does not confirm or deny anything, he explained that anything is possible.|$|E
