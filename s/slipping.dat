3000|$|The 2014 Bungo slow <b>slip</b> was {{occurring}} between May 1, 2014, and October 1, 2014 (Fig.  4 c), following the southern and northern Miyazaki slow <b>slips</b> (Fig.  4 b). This slow <b>slip</b> {{was very small}} compared with the 1997, 2003, and 2010 Bungo slow <b>slips,</b> whose slippage was one order larger, suggesting that this event was {{a different type of}} slow <b>slip</b> (Ozawa et al. 2013). The 2016 Bungo slow <b>slip</b> occurred in an area where the aseismic <b>slip</b> was small during the 2014 Bungo slow <b>slip</b> in this study. In particular, the main <b>slip</b> area between February 1, 2016, and April 10, 2016, was shallower than that of the 2014 Bungo event. This aseismic <b>slip</b> area in southwestern Shikoku in 2016 <b>slipped</b> during the 1997, 2003, and 2010 Bungo slow <b>slips,</b> whose durations were approximately 1  year, at an early stage of the <b>slip</b> history (Ozawa et al. 2013). If the 2016 Bungo slow <b>slip</b> is of the same type as the 1997, 2003, and 2010 Bungo slow <b>slips,</b> which occurred with a time interval of 6  years, we can assume that the <b>slip</b> has moved to the Bungo channel over time, as was the case for these past long-term Bungo slow <b>slips</b> (Ozawa et al. 2013). The interval between the 2010 and 2016 Bungo slow <b>slips</b> was approximately 6  years, consistent with the interval between past Bungo slow <b>slip</b> events, although we need more data to confirm that the 2016 Bungo slow <b>slip</b> is of the same type as the past Bungo slow <b>slips.</b> Regarding the <b>slip</b> budget, the slippage of the Bungo slow <b>slip</b> events ranged from approximately 20 – 30  cm before the Tohoku earthquake. Since the <b>slip</b> deficit rate is approximately 6  cm/year in this region (Additional file 5), the <b>slip</b> deficit amounts to 36  cm for a 6 -year recurrence interval, which approximately satisfies <b>slip</b> budget in part of the denoted segment in Fig.  4 h.

5000|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, a <b>slip</b> fielder (collectively, a <b>slip</b> cordon or the <b>slips)</b> is placed behind the batsman on the off side of the field. They are placed {{with the aim of}} {{catching}} an edged ball which is beyond the wicket-keeper's reach. Many teams employ two or three <b>slips</b> (numbered from the <b>slip</b> fielder closest to the wicket-keeper: first <b>slip,</b> second <b>slip,</b> etc.). A floating <b>slip</b> is sometimes employed, usually in limited over games, who patrols an area in the <b>slip</b> cordon that would ordinarily be occupied by more than one fielder. The <b>slip</b> cordon's distance from the batsman increases with the pace of the bowler; generally they will be marginally further away from the batsman than the wicketkeeper is. Because of the resulting geometry, spin bowlers generally have fewer <b>slips</b> in the cordon than a fast bowler would in an equivalent game situation. As fielding in the <b>slips</b> requires quick reflexes and sure hands, usually the most adept catchers in the team will make up the <b>slip</b> cordon. Most <b>slip</b> fielders are top order batsmen. Specialist <b>slip</b> fielders are sometimes called [...] "slippers".|$|R

The harmony search algorithm was adopted to alter the potential <b>slip</b> surface in order to locate the critical reliability <b>slip</b> surface.

5|$|Wheels {{are prone}} to slipping—an {{inability}} to generate traction—on loose or slippery terrain. <b>Slipping</b> wastes energy and can potentially lead {{to a loss of}} control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels {{can be seen in the}} realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer less from <b>slipping</b> than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground—but they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.|$|E

50|$|In {{materials}} science, a <b>slip</b> system {{describes the}} set of symmetrically identical <b>slip</b> planes and associated family of <b>slip</b> directions for which dislocation motion can easily occur and lead to plastic deformation.An external force makes parts of the crystal lattice glide along each other, changing the material's geometry.Depending {{on the type of}} lattice, different <b>slip</b> systems are present in the material.More specifically, <b>slip</b> occurs on close-packed planes (those containing the greatest number of atoms per area), and in close-packed directions (most atoms per length). The magnitude and direction of <b>slip</b> are represented by the Burgers vector.The picture on the right shows a schematic view of the <b>slip</b> mechanism.The <b>slip</b> planes and <b>slip</b> directions in a crystal have specific crystallographic forms.The <b>slip</b> planes are normally the planes with the highest density of atoms, i.e., those most closely spaced, and the direction of the <b>slip</b> is the direction in the <b>slip</b> plane that corresponds to one of the shortest lattice translation vectors.Often, this is the direction in which atoms are most closely spaced.A <b>slip</b> plane and a <b>slip</b> direction constitute a <b>slip</b> system.A critical resolved shear stress is required to initiate a <b>slip.</b> <b>Slip</b> is an important mode of deformation mechanism in crystals.For metals and technically used metallic alloys it {{is by far the most}} important deformation mechanism and subject to current research in materials science.|$|R

40|$|We {{analyzed}} continuous GPS data {{to investigate}} the spatio-temporal distribution of co-seismic <b>slip,</b> post-seismic <b>slip,</b> and largest aftershock associated with the 1994 Sanriku-haruka-oki, Japan, earthquake (Mw = 7. 7). To get better resolution for co-seismic and post-seismic <b>slip</b> distribution, we imposed a weak constraint as a priori information of the co-seismic <b>slip</b> determined by seismic wave analyses. We found that the post-seismic <b>slip</b> during 100 days following the main-shock amount to as much moment release as the main-shock, and that the sites of co-seismic <b>slip</b> and post-seismic <b>slip</b> are partitioning on a plate boundary region in complimentary fashion.

40|$|Local <b>slip</b> {{velocity}} is {{an important}} factor in mass,momentum and heat transfer of riser reactors. Based on the EMMS model, the qualitative and quantitative analysis is made for local <b>slip</b> velocity and its components (the <b>slip</b> velocity in the dense phase (cluster), the <b>slip</b> velocity in the dilute phase and the <b>slip</b> velocity between dense phase and dilute phase). It is found that the <b>slip</b> velocity between dense phase and dilute phase makes the most contribution to the local <b>slip</b> velocity and clusters lead to the high local <b>slip</b> velocity, from which the correlation of local <b>slip</b> velocity with local voidage is derived. Using this correlation, the local gas-solids <b>slip</b> velocities in gas-solids up-risers are predicted. Calculation results are well consistent with experimental data. Furthermore, the effects of operating conditions on local <b>slip</b> velocities are discussed. It is concluded that local <b>slip</b> velocity increases with the increase of solids circulating rate and decreases with the increase of superficial gas velocity...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between <b>slip</b> bands and grain boundaries in commercial-purity titanium was examined using cross-correlation-based electron backscatter diffraction. At a low strain level, {{three types of}} interactions were observed: blocked <b>slip</b> band with stress concentration; <b>slip</b> transfer; and blocked <b>slip</b> band with no stress concentration. The stress concentration induced by the blocked <b>slip</b> band was fitted with Eshelby's theoretical model, from which a Hall-Petch coefficient was deduced. It {{was found that the}} Hall-Petch coefficient varies with the individual grain boundary. We investigated the geometric alignment between the <b>slip</b> band and various <b>slip</b> systems to the neighbouring grain. Stress concentration can be induced by the blocked <b>slip</b> band if the <b>slip</b> system is poorly aligned with prismatic, pyramidal or basal <b>slip</b> systems in the neighbouring grain. Transfer of <b>slip</b> across the boundary occurs when there is good alignment on prismatic or pyramidal <b>slip</b> systems. Other stress-relieving mechanisms are possible when the best alignment is not with the <b>slip</b> system that has the lower critical resolved shear stress. © 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.
