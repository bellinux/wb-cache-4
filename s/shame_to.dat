5|$|On 31 October 1517, Luther sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Brandenburg, under whose {{authority}} the indulgences were being sold. In the letter, Luther addresses the archbishop out of a loyal desire to alert him to the pastoral problems created by the indulgence sermons. He assumes that Albert is unaware of what is being preached under his authority, and speaks out of concern that the people are being led away from the gospel, and that the indulgence preaching may bring <b>shame</b> <b>to</b> Albert's name. Luther does not condemn indulgences or the current doctrine regarding them, nor even the sermons which had been preached themselves, as he had not seen them firsthand. Instead he states his concern regarding the misunderstandings of the people about indulgences which have been fostered by the preaching, such as the belief that any sin could be forgiven by indulgences or that the guilt as well as the punishment for sin could be forgiven by an indulgence. In a postscript, Luther wrote that Albert could find some theses on the matter enclosed with his letter, so that he could see the uncertainty surrounding the doctrine of indulgences in contrast to the preachers who spoke so confidently of the benefits of indulgences.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} with church and cathedral officials, held on 11 June, reporters noted that three people had been shot within {{the city in the}} {{previous}} 72 hours. The attendees produced a letter by the Very Reverend Rogers Govender, on behalf of the Dean and Canons of Manchester Cathedral to Sony. It stated that they were currently seeking the advice of lawyers in the matter, and reserved their legal position in relation to the same. It demanded a substantial donation for the cathedral's work with youth in resisting the culture of gun crime and other forms of violence in our society. It further demanded the immediate withdrawal of the game, and that Sony not re-issue it without removing the section of the game containing the Cathedral interior. Govender described the use of images of the cathedral as virtual desecration. The letter stressed that they were in consultation with their lawyers and urged Sony to contact them so there can be a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the matter. Govender told reporters that the church officials had only been told of the content on 8 June 2007, and, after watching footage of gameplay posted on YouTube, said they were dismayed beyond belief and were shocked to see a place of worship being presented to youths as a place where guns may be fired, and that every year, they invite hundreds of teenagers to see the Cathedral and appreciate it as an alternative to violence. They added that it was a <b>shame</b> <b>to</b> have a game like this undermining such important work. They also sought that Sony apologise unreservedly.|$|E

25|$|An {{ideology}} of preserving family honor is deeply rooted is society {{and is not}} affected by high levels of education. Many women in Turkey are well educated but still {{are expected to be}} modest and sexually pure in order to preserve the honor of their families. If a family's honor is breached, it brings <b>shame</b> <b>to</b> the entire family. In such cases, traditionally the family would decide the fate of the female that brought shame. This might involve forcing the young woman into a shotgun wedding, while in extreme cases a young male in the family was given the duty to cleanse the family name through an honor killing. With recent changes to criminal law that removed reduced sentences for honor killings, females that brought <b>shame</b> <b>to</b> the family are sometimes forced to commit honor suicides by their families, especially in the predominantly Kurdish South-East regions, a region that greatly values traditions. Families who do not want their sons to face possible incrimination have encouraged their daughters to commit suicide. The number of female suicides over the years has increased greatly. Stories have surfaced revealing girls who are given tools with which to kill themselves such as rope to hang themselves, poisons to drink, or a gun to shoot themselves. Some murders have also been disguised as suicides in order to protect family members. Female family members {{are not the only ones}} that may be punished to preserve family honor. It is proposed that the death of a male homosexual physics student, Ahmet Yildiz, was an honor killing.|$|E
25|$|Contrastingly {{in other}} Asian cultures, {{especially}} for families in South Asia and the Far East, family honor depends on other {{factors such as}} education. Academic success of a student {{is seen as a}} source of pride and honor for the Asian family. Therefore, both the Asian student and the parents work hard to avoid academic failure which brings <b>shame</b> <b>to</b> the family. In the past, honor in East Asia was also linked to success in the battlefield. In Japan, for example, ritualized suicide practices such as harakiri were committed by Japanese samurai for centuries {{in the event of a}} defeat in battle. Instead of being captured or living with the shame of defeat, harakiri was committed in order to preserve the honor of their families.|$|E
25|$|While {{the rate}} of {{domestic}} violence among immigrant groups does not differ {{from that of the}} general population, immigrant victims of domestic violence may face additional challenges. While victims can be of either gender, women may be especially vulnerable. The process of immigrating to another country and adjusting to American culture can be stressful, increasing the likelihood of domestic violence. Factors such as limited English language ability, legal status, and lack of social ties may create additional barriers for those trying to escape such situations. Even when a woman does have access to social services that could help her escape an abusive situation, cultural norms may make it difficult for her to leave. If a woman decides to leave an abusive spouse she may run the risk of social ostracism and of bringing <b>shame</b> <b>to</b> her family. Thus, a woman may choose to stay and suffer abuse rather than face the social consequences of leaving her husband.|$|E

25|$|Habib Bourguiba {{was officially}} born on August 3, 1903, in Monastir to Ali Bourguiba (1850–1925) and Fattouma Khefacha (1861–1913). Being their eighth and last child, his birth was a <b>shame</b> <b>to</b> {{his mother and}} a worry to his father, who {{conceived}} him in an advanced age. Born into a modest family, the young Habib {{was raised in a}} female environment and was marked by gender inequality. Despite his financial conditions, Ali Bourguiba decided to invest his money in the education of his son and therefore, avoid him his fate of being enrolled in the army. Likewise, he sent his son to Tunis, circa 1907, to live with his brother M'hamed, in order to study in elementary school of Sadiki. Separated from his mother at 5, he lived in modest conditions in the capital city, and the Jellaz Affair made a deep impression on him. In 1913, he obtained his Certificat d'études primaires to the relief of his father, exempting him from military service and permitted him to pursue his secondary education in Sadiki. However, in the same year, he lost his mother at the age of 10, which marked his entire life.|$|E
25|$|After {{this had}} the king a large meeting, and very deep {{consultation}} with his council, about this land; {{how it was}} occupied, and by what sort of men. Then sent he his men over all England into each shire; commissioning them to find out 'How many hundreds of hides were in the shire, what land the king himself had, and what stock upon the land; or, what dues {{he ought to have}} by the year from the shire.' Also he commissioned them to record in writing, 'How much land his archbishops had, and his diocesan bishops, and his abbots, and his earls;' and though I may be prolix and tedious, 'What, or how much, each man had, who was an occupier of land in England, either in land or in stock, and how much money it were worth.' So very narrowly, indeed, did he commission them to trace it out, that there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover (it is shameful to tell, though he thought it no <b>shame</b> <b>to</b> do it), not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in his writ. And all the recorded particulars were afterwards brought to him.|$|E

500|$|When Caged Bird was {{published}} in 1969, Angelou was hailed as {{a new kind of}} memoirist, one of the first African-American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life. Up to that point, Black women writers were marginalized {{to the point that they}} were unable to present themselves as central characters. Writer Julian Mayfield, who called Caged Bird [...] "a work of art that eludes description", has insisted that Angelou's autobiographies set a precedent for African-American autobiography as a whole. Als insisted that Caged Bird marked one of the first times that a Black autobiographer could, as Als put it, [...] "write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense". [...] Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized as a respected spokesperson for blacks and women. Caged Bird made her [...] "without a doubt...

Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode [...] "is not as smart as it thinks it is. But it's still pretty smart." [...] John Keegan, writing for Critical Myth, on the other hand, gave the episode a more mixed review {{and gave it a}} 6 out of 10 rating.

[...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode [...] "bizarre yet amusing" [...] and said that the central numerology story [...] "doesn't feel like it's enough to sustain an entire episode".|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{minorities}} experience {{higher levels}} of stress than heterosexuals, which in turn affects coping and psychological quality of life (PQOL). Although many sexual minorities remain mentally healthy, a higher prevalence of mental disorders {{among members of the}} lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) communities exists; thus, LGB PQOL becomes an important area to examine. Several key factors are related <b>to</b> PQOL: <b>shame</b> due <b>to</b> heterosexism, self-esteem and perceived stress. Using minority stress model, I hypothesized that <b>shame</b> due <b>to</b> heterosexism and perceived stress are negatively correlated with PQOL, while self-esteem is positively correlated with PQOL. I hypothesized that collectively <b>shame</b> due <b>to</b> heterosexism, self-esteem and perceived stress account for a significant proportion of the variance in PQOL, that self-esteem moderates the relationship between perceived stress and PQOL and that age moderates the relationship between <b>shame</b> due <b>to</b> heterosexism and PQOL. I calculated Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and found <b>shame</b> due <b>to</b> heterosexism was negatively correlated with PQOL (r(146) = -. 21, p =. 009), perceived stress was negatively correlated with PQOL (r (146) = -. 69, p <. 001) and self-esteem was positively correlated with PQOL (r(146) =. 72, p <. 001). I conducted a regression analysis and found our model accounted for 59 % of the variance in PQOL (adj. R 2 =. 59, F(3, 144) = 68. 88, p <. 001). Self-esteem did moderate the relationship between perceived stress and PQOL (p =. 029), but age did not moderate the relationship between <b>shame</b> due <b>to</b> heterosexism and PQOL. Results suggest perceived stress and self-esteem play key roles in sexual minorities’ PQOL. Implications are discussed...|$|R
