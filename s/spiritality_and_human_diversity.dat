40|$|Professional youth {{work is in}} {{most cases}} blurred and not {{acknowledged}} appropriately by policy and the powers that be. The demand for professionalism is increasing as investment in youth work is considered beneficial to holistic development and progress in South Africa and other Commonwealth countries. According to this paper, investing in the knowledge base and expertise of youth workers is imperative for professionalism in youth work. Youth work professionalism is critical and {{it is suggested that}} the role of continuous education and training, also known as lifelong learning, can lead to a professional recognition of youth workers and their work. Mere formal education resulting in a certificate is not enough for the professional development of youth work in a rapidly changing and globalised world of innovation and high technology. A review of the available literature was the main source of information for this paper. A library search was conducted and relevant information examined to provide the description and analysis of the various approaches to youth work professionalism. Professionalism in youth work through continuous education and training should produce the following distinctive qualities: acceptance of the moral and ethical responsibility inherent in youth work practice; promotion of the wellbeing of young persons and their families in a context of respect and collaboration; and valuing care of young people as essential for emotional growth, social competence, rehabilitation and treatment. There is a need to acknowledge the strengths arising from cultural <b>and</b> <b>human</b> <b>diversity.</b> Valuing individual uniqueness and family, community, culture <b>and</b> <b>human</b> <b>diversity</b> is integral to the developmental and intervention process.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade the {{relationship}} between biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>human</b> <b>diversity</b> has received increased attention, resulting {{in the identification of}} what the Declaration of Belém calls an `inextricable link¿ between biological and cultural diversity. Although the term biocultural diversity, introduced to denote this link, is being used increasingly, there has been little critical reflection on what it precisely refers to. I argue that it is used with particular reference to `indigenous traditional¿ people, but that there is scope for extending its application within biocultural discourse. I therefore review the concept of culture and discuss what constitutes cultural values of the natural environment. I conclude that the concept of culture must be understood as involving a dynamic process of transcultural exchange and constant re-articulations of tradition resulting in the persistence of certain cultural practices. This approach ultimately reveals that the concept of biocultural diversity is also applicable to non-indigenous traditional communitie...|$|R

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that a scientifically credible conception {{of human nature}} must reject the folkbiological idea of a fixed, inner essence that makes us human.

Drawing on the framework of developmental systems theory {{and the idea of}} developmental niche construction we argue that human nature is not embodied in only one input to development, such as the genome, and that it should not be confined to universal or typical human characteristics. Both similarities and certain classes of differences are explained by a human developmental system that reaches well out into the 'environment'. We point to a significant overlap between our account and the ‘Life History Trait Cluster’ account of Grant Ramsey, and defend the developmental systems account against the accusation that trying to encompass developmental plasticity <b>and</b> <b>human</b> <b>diversity</b> leads to an unmanageably complex account of human nature...|$|R

40|$|From Introduction] Natural {{resources}} are often only perceived {{as contributing to}} rural livelihoods through food production and household welfare. There is a growing wealth of information capturing the direct-use values {{of the environment and}} consequent recognition of natural resources as being “the poor man's overcoat”. These approaches, however, have failed to fully account for the various ways in which different groups of people make use of, and find value in biodiversity. New developments within the field of anthropology have begun to explore the relationship between biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>human</b> <b>diversity.</b> This view has largely come about because many of the areas of highest biological diversity are inhabited by indigenous and traditional people, providing what the Declaration of Belem (1988) calls an 'inextricable link' between biological and cultural diversity (Posey 1999). The term bio-cultural diversity was introduced by Posey in 1999 to describe the concept denoting this link. Funding was received from the South Africa-Netherlands Programme on Alternatives in Development (SANPAD) and the International Foundation of Science (IFS...|$|R

40|$|Mycobacterium africanum is {{a member}} of the Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} complex (MTBC) and an important cause of human tuberculosis in West Africa that is rarely observed elsewhere. Here we genotyped 613 MTBC clinical isolates from Ghana, and searched for associations between the different phylogenetic lineages of MTBC and patient variables. We found that 17. 1 % (105 / 613) of the MTBC isolates belonged to M. africanum, with the remaining belonging to M. tuberculosis sensu stricto. No M. bovis was identified in this sample. M. africanum was significantly more common in tuberculosis patients belonging to the Ewe ethnic group (adjusted odds ratio: 3. 02; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 67 - 5. 47, p< 0. 001). Stratifying our analysis by the two phylogenetic lineages of M. africanum (i. e. MTBC Lineages 5 and 6) revealed that this association was mainly driven by Lineage 5 (also known as M. africanum West Africa 1). Our findings suggest interactions between the genetic <b>diversity</b> of MTBC <b>and</b> <b>human</b> <b>diversity,</b> <b>and</b> offer a possible explanation for the geographical restriction of M. africanum to parts of West Africa...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if the small liberal arts Christian colleges provide a distinctive environment apart from the traditional classifications of colleges and universities. The environments of the six sample colleges were assessed by administering the Institutional Functioning Inventory (IFI) to faculty and administrators. Statistically significant differences were found among the colleges on eight of the 11 environmental dimensions. However, it was concluded that the colleges constituted a relatively homogeneous group on all dimensions measured except Self-Study and Planning. Total sample means on the 11 scales of the IFI allowed for a generic description of 11 dimensions of the environments at these colleges. They were described as environments low on intellectual-aesthetic extracurriculum activities, <b>human</b> <b>diversity,</b> personal <b>and</b> academic freedom, concern for improving society, and concern for advancing knowledge, while being high on institutional esprit and placing high emphasis on undergraduate teaching and learning. The environments were characterized as having moderate amounts of democratic governance, self-study and planning, innovative educational practices, and programs designed to meet the needs of their immediate communities. The sample colleges differed significantly from both the liberal arts colleges and the four-year state colleges on eight of the IFI scales. When compared to the liberal arts colleges, the most notable differences were the considerably lower scores on Intellectual-Aesthetic Extracurriculum, Freedom, <b>Human</b> <b>Diversity,</b> <b>and</b> Concern for Advancing Knowledge. When compared to the four-year state colleges they were most distinguished by considerably lower scores on Intellectual-Aesthetic Extra curriculum, Freedom, <b>and</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Diversity,</b> <b>and</b> by higher scores on Concern for Undergraduate Learning and Institutional Esprit. The conclusion of the study is that these colleges do provide a unique college environment.
