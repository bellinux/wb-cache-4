5|$|The cirque where Castle Lake {{is found}} {{is a classic}} Northern Hemisphere cirque. The cirque {{headwall}} (the highest part of the mountain where the glacier began to form) was in the south or southwest, and {{the part of the}} mountain that sloped downward to the northeast was away from the prevailing winds. The resulting <b>shaded</b> <b>area</b> was sheltered from direct sun, and from the evaporating effects of wind. These conditions encouraged snow which had fallen in the winter to remain throughout the summer and fall, creating a year-round snow pack which grew deeper each year.|$|E

As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.|$|E

25|$|Plans {{to develop}} the Pier 6 Landscape are underway. The Pier 6 {{landscape}} will complete park construction of the outer two-thirds of the pier. Designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, the design integrates the landscape with the proposed viewing platform at the northwest corner, while large lawns and planted areas will provide a counterpoint to the adjacent active program at Piers 5 and 6. The centralized flower meadow and perimeter plantings will introduce new ecologies to {{the southern end of}} the park and the large lawn areas will provide space for park programs and events. The Pier 6 viewing platform is designed by Bjarke Ingels Group and its construction is contingent on funding. The plan provides a <b>shaded</b> <b>area</b> for visitors and space for events and programs.|$|E
25|$|Several {{variations}} of turtle racing exist. While turtle racing typically {{takes place on}} land, turtle races have occasionally occurred in pools as well. Some races begin with the turtles racing from a starting location and end when they reach a designated finish line. Outdoor races occasionally start the turtles in a sunny spot near a <b>shaded</b> <b>area</b> and the turtles by nature race into the shade. Other races begin with the turtles all being placed {{in the center of}} a large circle, the first to pass outside of the circle is deemed the winner. In some cases, a large lid is placed on top of the turtles before the race and the race begins when the lid is lifted off of them. The turtles are often distinguished by numbers painted or taped on their shells.|$|E
40|$|In {{the former}} {{study by the}} authors the {{boundary}} position (angle) of light and <b>shade</b> <b>areas</b> perceived on the cylinder surface was consistent with that showing the largest ratio of luminance (or illuminace) at successive two points on the cylinder surface. The apparent proportion of light and <b>shade</b> <b>areas</b> of the face was geometrically obtained by the boundary position (angle) of the light and <b>shade</b> <b>areas</b> when the face was simulated as a half cylinder and satisfactorily explained the perceived modeling. In the present study the data obtained in the previous experiments on the modelling evaluation was synthetically analyzed. As a result, multiple regression model for modelling of human face at a window was constructed with two variables of the semi-cylindrical illuminance ratio and the apparent proportion of light and <b>shade</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

Focus groups at eight schools suggest students were unaware of changes to their habitual use of favoured locations. Results infer careful selection of locations for built-shade and provision of tables with seats will assist in maximising student use and investments in shade sails...|$|R

2500|$|In practice, {{the current}} density mainly {{comes out of}} a group of states close in energy to state F, most of which lie within the heavily <b>shaded</b> <b>area</b> in the energy-space diagram. Since, for a free-electron model, the {{contribution}} to the current density is directly proportional to the area in energy space (with the Sommerfeld supply density zS as the constant of proportionality), it is useful to think of the ECD as drawn from electron states in an area of size dF2 (measured in eV2) in the energy-space diagram. That is, it is useful to think of the ECD as drawn from states in the heavily <b>shaded</b> <b>area</b> in Fig. 1. (This approximation gets slowly worse as temperature increases.) ...|$|E

Day boats are generally relatively large: typically, between [...] in length, as they must provide some comfort for the passengers for several hours. Many day boats {{are used for}} scuba-divers and also for other marine tourism activities such as fishing and whale-watching. In general, divers or passengers will spend only the daylight hours on a day boat, and do not sleep in them overnight. Dive boats which provide sleeping accommodation are generally referred to as [...] "live-aboard" [...] boats. Generally a professional crew operate the boat. The boat provides shelter from the weather {{and is likely to}} have various facilities such as a toilet (called the [...] "head") and a small kitchen (called a [...] "galley"), to cater for the guests and crew. Day-boats may have a saloon where divers can relax on upholstered benches, and one or more dining tables. Many day boats also have an uncovered sun-deck, and a <b>shaded</b> <b>area,</b> for divers wishing {{to be out in the}} open air. The boat will usually have a diving air compressor, oxygen first aid, a VHF radio, a GPS and possibly gas blending facilities. A day boat would generally be used to transport divers to multiple dive-sites (typically between one and three sites) during the same day, or multiple dives at the same site, with surface rest and refreshment periods between them.|$|E
