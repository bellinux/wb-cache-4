40|$|A {{critical}} component of the Descending Bed Cell (also known as the Spouted Bed Cell) is the diaphragm used to separate the anode from the descending volume of metallic beads. In laboratory studies, <b>semi-permeable</b> <b>materials</b> (e. g. Daramic) have been used extensively, but these {{have proven to be}} too fragile for continuous, commercial type of operation. In order to find a more suitable material or group of materials, experimental studies were undertaken to determine both the electrical and mechanical resistances of various fabrics and composites. Materials included mechanically perforated plastic sheets of Teflon, PVC, Polypropylene, polycarbonate, woven filter clothes of Teflon, polypropylene and polyester and felt type filter materials of polypropylene and polyester. While all of these gave electrical resistance data only specific weaves of filter cloth had suitable capabilities in preventing the formation of short circuits. The work has lead to a combination of materials and weaves for which continuous operations for more than 10 days have been achieved...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} into the moisture retention properties of saltstone suggest that osmotic pressure may play a potentially significant role in contaminant transport (Dixon et al., 2009 and Dixon, 2011). The Savannah River Remediation Closure and Disposal Assessments Group requested the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to conduct a literature search on osmotic potential {{as it relates to}} contaminant transport and to develop a conceptual model of saltstone that incorporates osmotic potential. This report presents the findings of the literature review and presents a conceptual model for saltstone that incorporates osmotic potential. The task was requested through Task Technical Request HLW-SSF-TTR- 2013 - 0004. Simulated saltstone typically has very low permeability (Dixon et al. 2008) and pore water that contains a large concentration of dissolved salts (Flach and Smith 2013). Pore water in simulated saltstone has a high salt concentration relative to pore water in concrete and groundwater. This contrast in salt concentration can generate high osmotic pressures if simulated saltstone has the properties of a semipermeable membrane. Estimates of osmotic pressure using results from the analysis of pore water collected from simulated saltstone show that an osmotic pressure up to 2790 psig could be generated within the saltstone. Most <b>semi-permeable</b> <b>materials</b> are non-ideal and have an osmotic efficiency < 1 and as a result actual osmotic pressures are less than theoretical pressures. Observations from laboratory tests of simulated saltstone indicate that it may exhibit the behavior of a semi-permeable membrane. After several weeks of back pressure saturation in a flexible wall permeameter (FWP) the membrane containing a simulated saltstone sample appeared to have bubbles underneath it. Upon removal from the FWP the specimen was examined and it was determined that the bubbles were due to liquid that had accumulated between the membrane and the sample. One possible explanation for the accumulation of solution between the membrane and sample is the development of osmotic pressure within the sample. Osmotic pressure will affect fluid flow and contaminant transport and may result in the changes to the internal structure of the semi-permeable material. B�nard et al. 2008 reported swelling of wet cured Portland cement mortars containing salts of NaNO{sub 3 }, KNO{sub 3 }, Na{sub 3 }PO{sub 4 }x 12 H {sub 2 }O, and K{sub 3 }PO{sub 4 } when exposed to a dilute solution. Typically hydraulic head is considered the only driving force for groundwater in groundwater models. If a low permeability material containing a concentrated salt solution is present in the hydrogeologic sequence large osmotic pressures may develop and lead to misinterpretation of groundwater flow and solute transport. The osmotic pressure in the semi-permeable material can significantly impact groundwater flow {{in the vicinity of the}} semi-permeable material. One possible outcome is that groundwater will flow into the semi-permeable material resulting in hydrologic containment within the membrane. Additionally, hyperfiltration can occur within <b>semi-permeable</b> <b>materials</b> when water moves through a membrane into the more concentrated solution and dissolved constituents are retained in the lower concentration solution. Groundwater flow and transport equations that incorporate chemical gradients (osmosis) have been developed. These equations are referred to as coupled flow equations. Currently groundwater modeling to assess the performance of saltstone waste forms is conducted using the PORFLOW groundwater flow and transport model. PORFLOW does not include coupled flow from chemico-osmotic gradients and therefore numerical simulation of the effect of coupled flow on contaminant transport in and around saltstone cannot be assessed. Most natural semi-permeable membranes are non-ideal membranes and do not restrict all movement of solutes and as a result theoretical osmotic potential is not realized. Osmotic efficiency is a parameter in the coupled flow equation that accounts for the non-ideal behavior of most semi-permeable membranes. On order to evaluate the effects of osmotic potential on the hydraulic of a system the osmotic potential must be known. Several lab methods have been developed to measure osmotic efficiency for use in coupled flow analysis...|$|E

The effects of membrane surface tension on the sound absorption characteristics were investigated. The characteristics of the membrane absorber were measured experimentally in terms of Sound Absorption Coefficient, α and Noise Reduction Coefficient, NRC. The membrane is made of a thin, flexible, <b>semi-permeable</b> latex <b>material</b> and the tests were carried out by using impedance tube method according to ISO 10534 - 2 standard.

50|$|A wall can {{be fixed}} (e.g. a {{constant}} volume reactor) or moveable (e.g. a piston). For example, in a reciprocating engine, a fixed wall means the piston is locked at its position; then, a constant volume process may occur. In that same engine, a piston may be unlocked and allowed to move in and out. Ideally, a wall may be declared adiabatic, diathermal, impermeable, permeable, or <b>semi-permeable.</b> Actual physical <b>materials</b> that provide walls with such idealized properties are not always readily available.|$|R
40|$|Among the {{diseases}} induced by protein or hormone deficiencies, {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus is becoming increasingly widespread and makes life very difficult {{for people who are}} affected. It is characterized by the destruction of the insulin secreting β-cells by the immune system. The most commonly used treatment is the insulinotherapy which implies a drastic diet and much attention from the patient who is all the time put at risk of hyper- or hypoglycemia. A first alternative is the transplantation of pancreas or islets of Langerhans but the low number of donor and the necessity to follow an immunosuppressive medication to prevent the graft rejection are serious drawbacks. A promising solution for the treatment of this type of disease is the encapsulation of xenogeneic cells within a biocompatible, robust and <b>semi-permeable</b> <b>material</b> which will protect them against immune system or mechanical stress This thesis highlights the possibility of using mineralized TiO 2 microcapsules synthesized under mild conditions as “artificial organ”. This original material has been developed by overcoming constraints induced by the use of alkoxy precursors in the inorganic materials preparation by sol-gel process such as the toxicity of some additives and of the by-products of reaction or the matrix contraction over time. This artificial organ is obtained by using alginate capsules entrapping animal cells as a template for the deposition of a TiO 2 layer. Various techniques underscored the biocompatibility, the high mechanical strength and the ideal porosity of the microcapsules while showing the prolongation of the viability and of the activity of the encapsulated HepG 2 model cells. In vivo experiments realized on rats highlighted the biocompatibility of the microcapsules towards a living host organism and the efficient encapsulated cells immune-isolation. Finally, the encapsulation of insulin secreting rat insulinoma-derived INS- 1 E cells showed that these cells retained their in vitro responsive property to glucose for insulin secretion and that this hormone diffused well outside of the microcapsules. This work allowed designing and developing a robust, biocompatible and porous biomaterial as an artificial organ suitable for the cell therapy. (DOCSC 03) [...] FUNDP, 201...|$|R
5000|$|One of his key {{interests}} was {{the energy}} status of soil water, and {{he led the}} way in developing new and improved methods of measuring soil water potential. Early in his career, Richards recognised the importance of capillary potential to plant-soil relations, and described the principles, construction and operation of the tensiometer. Richards also proposed the tension plate apparatus for determining capillary potential in soil. The tensiometer was developed from the idea of using a <b>semi-permeable,</b> porous ceramic <b>material</b> to balance a pressure potential against a matric potential; once equilibrium had established, the matric potential of the soil could be determined by balancing the pressure potential.|$|R
40|$|A compact, {{lightweight}} hydrogen-production {{system was}} developed for fuel-cell-based power supplies. Anhydrous ammonia is decomposed thermocatalytically in a microreactor to produce a fuel-cell feed gas. For an electrical energy capacity of 1250 W-h, this system has an energy density of 500 W-h/kg, which is roughly twice that of state-of-the-art batteries. Despite its energy-density advantage, this ammonia-based power supply will not likely be deployed in military or commercial markets unless safety concerns related to the possible rapid release of ammonia are resolved. <b>Semi-permeable,</b> high-void-fraction <b>materials</b> were developed {{to address the issue}} of ammonia safety. Liquefied ammonia is loaded into a monolithic block of safe-storage material, which is installed in a suitable lightweight tank. In the event of tank puncture or leakage from another system component, the release of toxic/flammable gas to the surroundings is restricted by the safe-storage material. Gas release from the safe-storage material is on the order of 1 g/min, which is sufficiently slow to avoid rapid formation of dangerous ammonia concentrations in an enclosed space. These safe-storage materials can also be used for storage of liquefied hydrocarbons such as propane and butane...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{levels in}} many {{transuranic}} (TRU) waste drums are above the compliance threshold, therefore deeming the drums non-shippable to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Hydrogen getters (alkynes and dialkynes) {{are known to}} react irreversibly with hydrogen {{in the presence of}} certain catalysts. The primary purpose of this investigation is to ascertain the effectiveness of a hydrogen getter in an environment that contains gaseous compounds commonly found in the headspace of drums containing TRU waste. It is not known whether the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) commonly found in the headspace of TRU waste drums will inhibit (''poison'') the effectiveness of the hydrogen getter. The result of this study will be used to assess the feasibility of a hydrogen-getter system, which is capable of removing hydrogen from the payload containers or the Transuranic Package Transporter-II (TRUPACT-II) inner containment vessel to increase the quantity of TRU waste that can be shipped to the WIPP.

40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Ergonomics in 2004, available online: [URL] accumulation in sleeping bags during extended periods of use is detrimental to thermal comfort of the sleeper, and in extreme cases may lead to sleep loss and hypothermia. As sub-zero temperatures were expected to affect vapour resistance of microporous membranes, the effect of using semipermeable and impermeable rain covers for sleeping bags on the accumulation of moisture in the bags during 6 days of use at − 7 °C and 5 days at − 20 °C were investigated. In addition, the routine of shaking off hoarfrost {{from the inside of}} the cover after the sleep period as a preventive measure for moisture accumulation was studied. Moisture accumulation (ranging from 92 to 800 grams) was found {{to be related to the}} vapour resistance of the materials used. The best semipermeable material gave the same moisture build-up as no cover at − 7 °C, though build-up increased substantially at − 20 °C. Shaking off the hoarfrost from the inside of the cover after each use was beneficial in preventing a high moisture build-up. It was concluded that <b>semi-permeable</b> cover <b>materials</b> reduce moisture accumulation in sleeping bags at moderate sub-zero temperatures, but in more extreme cold (− 20 °C) the benefits are reduced in comparison to routinely shaking frost from impermeable covers. Compared to fixed impermeable covers, the benefits of all semi-permeable covers are large. For long-term use without drying facilities, the differences observed do favour the semi-permeable covers above impermeable ones, even when regularly removing the hoar frost from the inside in the latter...|$|R
