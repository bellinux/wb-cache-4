50|$|The BNC was {{the first}} text corpus of its size to be made widely available. This could be {{attributed}} to the <b>standard</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement,</b> between rights owners and the Consortium on the one hand, and between corpus users and the Consortium on the other. Intellectual property rights owners were sought for their agreement with the standard licence, including willingness to incorporate their materials in the corpus without any fees. This arrangement may have been facilitated by the originality of the concept and the prominence associated with the project. However, it was a challenge to keep the identity of contributors hidden without discrediting the value of their work. Any distinct allusion to the identity of contributors was largely removed; the alternative solution of substituting the identity of a contributor with a different name was discussed, but not considered feasible.|$|R

5000|$|A Lloyd's Open <b>Form,</b> {{formally}} Lloyd's <b>Standard</b> <b>Form</b> <b>of</b> Salvage <b>Agreement,</b> {{but more}} {{commonly referred to}} as LOF, is a standard legal document for a proposed marine salvage operation. The two-page contract is published by Lloyd's of London. It is called [...] "open" [...] because it is literally open, with no amount of money being stipulated for the salvage job: the sum to be paid is determined later in London by a professional arbitrator. At the top of page one, beneath the title [...] "Salvage Agreement" [...] is a statement of the contract's fundamental premise. [...] "NO CURE [...] - [...] NO PAY". The form originated in the late 19th century and is the most common such <b>form</b> <b>of</b> international salvage <b>agreement.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{contract}} {{salvage the}} owner of the property and salvor enter into a salvage contract prior to the commencement of salvage operations and the amount that the salvor is paid is determined by the contract. [...] This can be a fixed amount, based on a [...] "time and materials" [...] basis, or any other terms that both parties agree to. [...] The contract may also state that payment is only due if the salvage operation is successful (a.k.a. [...] "No Cure, No Pay"), or that payment is due even if the operation is not successful. By far the commonest single <b>form</b> <b>of</b> salvage contract internationally is Lloyd's <b>Standard</b> <b>Form</b> <b>of</b> Salvage <b>Agreement</b> (2011), an English law arbitration agreement administered by the Council of Lloyd's, London.|$|R
5000|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, the unionized {{sheet metal}} {{industry}} had been almost a family affair. In the days of independent, locally-owned sheet metal shops, union contractors and union workers relied on each other to build a productive industry. Many sheet metal contractors and union leaders even served their apprenticeships together, a shared work experience that often improved industrial relations.As national contractors gained prominence by the mid-20th century, that relationship changed with the times: With {{the rise of the}} Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors National Association - or SMACNA - in the 1940s, the national contractors group and the SMWIA agreed that “proper labor relations” would insure prosperity for all. Citing their “sincere desire for friendly cooperation,” the two organizations agreed to set industry rules by mutual consent: In 1947 they negotiated the <b>Standard</b> <b>Form</b> <b>of</b> Union <b>Agreement,</b> a model contract that addressed the industry’s interest in productivity as well as the union’s interest in fair wages and fair play.|$|R
40|$|New {{laws that}} are {{designed}} to protect small businesses from falling victim to unfair contract terms may help tip the balance of power back in favour of smaller farmers, {{especially when it comes to}} innovations involving data. In November 2016, Australia’s current regime of protection against unfair contract terms for consumers will be extended to cover unfair terms in <b>standard</b> pre-printed <b>form</b> contracts for small business. I am studying the impact of these changes on the multitude <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> contracts that farmers deal with on a daily basis, particularly contracts associated with digital agriculture. It won 2 ̆ 7 t be too long before we see swarms of autonomous, collision-avoiding agri-bots, driverless tractors and drones in use on farms. These digital technologies bring undeniable opportunities for productivity gains to farmers. However, for each digital farming technology adopted, a <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> “Terms <b>of</b> Use” <b>agreement</b> is entered into by the farmers. This regulates the collection and aggregation of the farm data by the technology. Read the full article on The Conversation...|$|R

As the JCT <b>Standard</b> <b>Form</b> <b>of</b> Building Contract {{is a product of}} the development of time, a brief history of its evolution is included to assist in understanding the concept of speciality contracts. The Contract is studied from a number of major view points, dealing with explanations and interpretations, of the more important financial and procedural matters raised within the conditions of contract. A section of the text is devoted to the study and comparison of the JCT 1980 with the recently published A. C.

40|$|The {{efficient}} and effective management of time on complex construction projects (especially when concerned with the development and resolution of extension of time claims) has long been considered {{a major issue in}} construction contracts. Recent research has culminated in the production <b>of</b> a new <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> contract drafted specifically as an attempt to overcome these issues. This research identifies the perceived critical success factors that are recommended to be included in, and addressed by the new <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> construction contract in an attempt to alleviate these issues, and reviews a selection <b>of</b> Australian <b>standard</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> construction contract for the presence of the perceived critical success factors. A review of current literature was carried out to identify the perceived critical success factors for the effective and efficient management of time with respect to extension of time claims, together with a qualitative analysis <b>of</b> the new <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> construction contract as verification of the identified critical success factors and their management and application. A comparative analysis was undertaken of the extension of time provisions of a selection <b>of</b> Australian <b>standard</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> construction contract as a means of determining their efficiency and effectiveness for resolving extension of time claims in a modern construction industry. The research identified 69 critical success factors that should be present in the clauses <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> construction contracts to efficiently and effectively enable the resolution of extension of time claims for the benefit of all parties involved. The selected Australian <b>standard</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> construction contract were found to be vague with respect to the content and inclusion of the perceived critical success factors, providing a greater opportunity for an extension of time claim to evolve into a dispute between the contracting parties...|$|R
