40|$|Abstract: <b>Vertical</b> <b>pumps</b> have {{intrinsically}} weak {{structures for}} vibration resonance {{because of their}} long slender shapes. Therefore, {{it is important to}} estimate the vibration characteristics of a <b>vertical</b> <b>pump</b> analytically and/or experimentally before its final installation. Sometimes, however, unexpected resonances arise after the installation. The unexpected resonance is found to be due to the difference between the boundary condition of a <b>vertical</b> <b>pump</b> for rigid-foundation test operation and for flexible-foundation real operation. In order to examine this problem and quantify the effect of the foundation condition on the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the entire pump assembly, amathematical model using a Euler–Bernoulli beam with a flexible foundation is presented. This model combines the lower and upper parts of a ver-tical pump, distinguishing it from previous analytical models. Experiments and simulations have been performed to validate this mathematical model and to evaluate the effect of foun-dation stiffness on vibration behaviour. Parametric studies have also been carried out to inves-tigate the effects of other design variables on the dynamic characteristics of the pumps and to propose design strategies for improvement in the dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate and enhance dynamic performance for a <b>vertical</b> <b>pumping</b> unit. The original electric motor of the pump unit had been replaced by another one different in design and weights. Vibration has been increased greatly after installing the new motor. Consequently, it is necessary to estimate the change in the vibration characteristics owing to the difference in the boundary conditions of the new motor. Measured vibration levels and frequency analysis were dangerous at 1 × due to resonance problem. Finite Element Analysis was used to model the motor structure in order to find its natural frequencies and mode shapes. The results confirm that the third natural frequency is very close to 1 × operating speed with deviation about 1 %. To solve the resonance problem, it was recommended to increase the structure stiffness. The results after modifications confirmed that the overall vibration level decreases by 89 %.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} the general {{topic of the}} gas entrainment from a free surface by a swirl issued from the pumping of fluids below the free surface. This phenomenon is investigated through an analytical experiment in water. A shear flow is generated between a horizontal flow and a stagnant flow.

One particularity of these experiments is the possibility to change the shape of the channel generating the inlet conditions by adding obstacles so as to trigger different conditions for the turbulent shear flow.

The frequency of gas entrainment occurrence is measured using visualizations of the flow.

40|$|Lecturepg. 107 The use of {{long shaft}} <b>vertical</b> <b>pumps</b> is common {{practice}} in the nuclear waste processing industry. Unfortunately, when such pumps employ plain cylindrical journal bearings, they tend to suffer from rotordynamic instability problems due to the inherent lightly-loaded condition that the vertical orientation places on the bearings. This paper describes {{a case study in}} which the authors utilized rotordynamic analysis and experimental vibration analysis to diagnose such a problem and designed replacement tilting-pad bearings to solve the problem. The subject pumps are 45 foot long <b>vertical</b> <b>pumps</b> used for mixing nuclear waste in one million gallon tanks. Each pumping system consists of an induction motor driven by a variable frequency drive, a segmented pump shaft with a centrifugal impeller at the bottom, and a pipe column that surrounds the pump shaft and is suspended into the tank. The column is filled with water that serves as the lubricant for the eight plain cylindrical journal bearings that support the pump shaft. Unfortunately, these pumps have been plagued with vibration related problems, such as bearing and seal failures, ever since they were commissioned. In order to evaluate the problem, the pump shaft and column were instrumented with vibration transducers, and vibration testing was performed. This testing revealed that subsynchronous whirling, at approximately one-half the running speed, was the primary culprit responsible for the failures. In an effort to understand the cause of the observed vibrations, a two-level rotordynamic model of the pump shafting and column was constructed. This rotordynamic model, like those for many <b>vertical</b> <b>pumps,</b> was far from routine. The rotordynamic analysis, which is described in detail, then successfully confirmed that the problem was subsynchronous whirling due to rotordynamic instability. This analysis was then used to guide the design of tilting-pad bearings employing offset pivots and geometric preload to replace the original plain cylindrical bearings and, thereby, resolve the instability problem. The plain cylindrical bearings were removed from a pump, tilting-pad bearings were installed, and subsequent testing verified the predicted vibration reduction. Accordingly, the application of tilting-pad bearings, whose design is described in detail, was conclusively shown to be an effective solution for this specific problem...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 18 It is well {{documented}} that the proper operation of <b>vertical</b> centrifugal <b>pumps</b> is greatly dependent upon the entire pump/piping system, which includes the piping geometry and the system operating conditions. Oftentimes, pump operate satisfactorily during shop tests but experience problems after they are installed in the field. Here, three large <b>vertical</b> <b>pumps</b> that operated satisfactorily on the test stand experienced excessive vibration after installation. Additionally, pulsation in the system piping {{was found to be}} causing unexpected vibration in downstream equipment. It was discovered that the problems were the result of complex interaction between several phenomena. Improper inlet conditions caused suction recirculation that generated broadband turbulence. The turbulent energy excited acoustical resonances of the pump/piping system, resulting in pulsation at several discrete frequencies. This energy subsequently excited mechanical natural frequencies of the motor/pump/piping system causing high amplitude nonsynchronous vibration of the pump and other structurers far downstream from the pump. Field data are presented. Diagnostic techniques and instrumentation needed to obtain the field data required to solve these problems are discussed. Also, additional data from pump hydraulic analysis and sump model tests are presented. Further, the solution strategy with two-step field changes (sump and pump) is shown.
