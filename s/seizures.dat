5|$|About 6% {{of those}} with {{epilepsy}} have <b>seizures</b> that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex <b>seizures.</b> Those with reflex epilepsy have <b>seizures</b> that are only triggered by specific stimuli. Common triggers include flashing lights and sudden noises. In certain types of epilepsy, <b>seizures</b> happen more often during sleep, and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping.|$|E
5|$|Epileptic <b>seizures</b> {{are thought}} to relate to {{abnormal}} electrical activity. Seizure activity can manifest as absence (of consciousness), focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech, or be generalized in nature. Status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of <b>seizures</b> that have not terminated within 30 minutes, although this definition has recently been revised. <b>Seizures</b> have {{a large number of}} causes, however many <b>seizures</b> occur without a definitive cause being found. In a person with epilepsy, risk factors for further <b>seizures</b> may include sleeplessness, drug and alcohol intake, and stress. <b>Seizures</b> may be assessed using blood tests, EEG and various medical imaging techniques based on the medical history and exam findings. In addition to treating an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors, anticonvulsant medications can play a role in preventing further <b>seizures.</b>|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic <b>seizures</b> on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic <b>seizures</b> experience altered states of consciousness. In partial epileptic <b>seizures,</b> consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic <b>seizures,</b> patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E
40|$|The {{risk factors}} and {{clinical}} implications of stress hyperglycemia in children with febrile <b>seizure</b> remain uncertain. Among 479 children with febrile <b>seizure,</b> the prevalence of the stress hyperglycemia (blood glucose concentration 150 mg/dL) was 10. 0 %. Stress hyperglycemia group included larger proportion of first-time febrile <b>seizure,</b> prolonged febrile <b>seizure,</b> and smaller pro-portion of short febrile <b>seizure</b> {{in comparison with the}} non–stress hyperglycemia group. Stress hyperglycemia group demon-strated a lower pH and higher lactate levels than the non–stress hyperglycemia group. Multivariate analysis revealed that first-time febrile <b>seizure</b> (aOR 3. 741, P. 004) and prolonged febrile <b>seizure</b> (aOR 12. 855, P <. 001) were significant risk factors for stress hyperglycemia. The rate of early febrile <b>seizure</b> recurrence in the emergency department was not different between the groups. These findings suggest that children experiencing first-time or prolonged febrile <b>seizure</b> are prone to stress hypergly-cemia, and this can be related to febrile <b>seizure</b> severity. However, stress hyperglycemia is not predictive of early febrile <b>seizure</b> recurrence in the emergency department...|$|R

5|$|Seizure {{prediction}} {{refers to}} attempts to forecast epileptic <b>seizures</b> {{based on the}} EEG before they occur. As of 2011, no effective mechanism to predict <b>seizures</b> has been developed. Kindling, where repeated exposures to events that could cause <b>seizures</b> eventually causes <b>seizures</b> more easily, {{has been used to}} create animal models of epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type (60%) of <b>seizures</b> are convulsive. Of these, one-third begin as {{generalized}} <b>seizures</b> from the start, affecting both hemispheres of the brain. Two-thirds begin as focal <b>seizures</b> (which affect one hemisphere of the brain) which may then progress to generalized <b>seizures.</b> The remaining 40% of <b>seizures</b> are non-convulsive. An example of this type is the absence seizure, which presents as a decreased level of consciousness and usually lasts about 10 seconds.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{medications}} available including phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. Low-quality evidence suggests that phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate may be equally effective in both focal and generalized <b>seizures.</b> Controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine, and may have fewer side effects. In the United Kingdom, carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatment for focal <b>seizures,</b> with levetiracetam and valproate as second-line due to issues of cost and side effects. Valproate is recommended first-line for generalized <b>seizures</b> with lamotrigine being second-line. In those with absence <b>seizures,</b> ethosuximide or valproate are recommended; valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic <b>seizures</b> and tonic or atonic <b>seizures.</b> If <b>seizures</b> are well-controlled on a particular treatment, it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether preoperative or postoperative electro-encephalography (EEG) can predict surgical outcome for corpus callosotomy. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 16 patients enrolled. We compared postoperative <b>seizure</b> outcome according to <b>seizure</b> type, preoperative interictal EEG, preoperative ictal EEG, and postoperative interictal EEG. <b>Seizure</b> outcome was classified according to postoperative <b>seizure</b> reduction, i. e., <b>seizure</b> free,> 90 %, 50 - 90 %, < 50 %, and no change or worsened. A <b>seizure</b> reduction of 50 % or more was judged as a “favorable outcome”. Results: Most patients showed a favorable outcome (12 patients, 75 %) and two patients became <b>seizure</b> free (13 %). Atonic <b>seizure</b> was most responsive to corpus callosotomy. Preoperative interictal epileptiform discharge had 3 patterns; bilateral independent, generalized, and combination of independent and generalized. None of the preoperative interictal epileptiform discharge (EDs) had significant correlation with <b>seizure</b> outcome. The preoperative ictal rhythm did not predict <b>seizure</b> outcome. However disappearance of generalized EDs on postoperative EEG was correlated with favorable <b>seizure</b> outcome...|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} initial <b>seizure</b> threshold {{by means}} of a structured stimulus dosage titration procedure in a clinical sample of 111 depressed patients undergoing brief-pulse, constant-current electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Initial <b>seizure</b> threshold was approximately 60 milli-coumbs (mc) (10 Joules) on average, but varied widely (6 -fold) across patients. Initial <b>seizure</b> threshold was predicted by four variables: electrode placement (higher with bilateral), gender (higher in men), age (higher with increasing age), and dynamic impedance (inverse relation-ship). Use of neuroleptic medication was associated with a lower <b>seizure</b> threshold. EEG <b>seizure</b> duration was inversely related to initial <b>seizure</b> threshold, but no other relations with <b>seizure</b> duration were found. These findings may have important clinical implications for stimulus dosing strategies in ECT. Key Words: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), <b>seizure</b> threshold, stimulus dosage titratio...|$|R
40|$|Implantable high-accuracy, and {{low-power}} <b>seizure</b> detection is a challenge. In this paper, {{we propose}} a cascade architecture to combine different <b>seizure</b> detec-tion algorithms to optimize power {{and accuracy of}} the overall <b>seizure</b> detection system. The proposed archi-tecture consists of a cascade of two <b>seizure</b> detection stages.

5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} or <b>seizures</b> {{are typically}} denied a pilot license. In Canada {{if an individual}} has had {{no more than one}} seizure, they may be considered after five years for a limited license if all other testing is normal. Those with febrile <b>seizures</b> and drug related <b>seizures</b> may also be considered. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration does not allow those with epilepsy to get a commercial pilot license. Rarely, exceptions can be made for persons who have had an isolated seizure or febrile <b>seizures</b> and have remained free of <b>seizures</b> into adulthood without medication. In the United Kingdom, a full national private pilot license requires the same standards as a professional driver's license. This requires a period of ten years without <b>seizures</b> while off medications. Those who do not meet this requirement may acquire a restricted license if free from <b>seizures</b> for five years.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are the {{preferred}} {{choice in the}} management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, in particular, for the prevention and treatment of the dangerous complication of <b>seizures</b> and in subduing severe delirium. Lorazepam is the only benzodiazepine with predictable intramuscular absorption and it is the most effective in preventing and controlling acute <b>seizures.</b>|$|E
5|$|Children {{may have}} {{behaviors}} that are easily mistaken for epileptic <b>seizures</b> but are not. These include breath-holding spells, bed wetting, night terrors, tics and shudder attacks. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause arching of the back and twisting of the {{head to the side}} in infants, which may be mistaken for tonic-clonic <b>seizures.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{children}} between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, a fever of 38 C or higher may lead to a <b>seizure</b> known as a febrile <b>seizure.</b> About 2-5% of all children will experience such a <b>seizure</b> during their childhood. In most cases, a febrile <b>seizure</b> will not lead to epilepsy. Approximately 40% of children who experience a febrile <b>seizure</b> will have another one.|$|R
40|$|Cyclothiazide (CTZ) {{has been}} {{reported}} to simultaneously enhance glutamate receptor excitation and inhibit GABAA receptor inhibition, and in turn it evokes epileptiform activities in hippocampal neurons. It has also been shown to acutely induce epileptic <b>seizure</b> behavior in freely moving rats. However, whether CTZ induced <b>seizure</b> rats could develop to have recurrent <b>seizure</b> still remains unknown. In the current study, we demonstrated that 46 % of the CTZ induced <b>seizure</b> rats developed to have recurrent <b>seizure</b> behavior as well as epileptic EEG with a starting latency between 2 weeks and several months. In those chronic <b>seizure</b> rats 6 months after the <b>seizure</b> induction by the CTZ, our immunohistochemistry results showed that both GAD and GAT- 1 were significantly decreased across CA 1, CA 3, and dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus studied. In addition, both BDNF and its receptor TrkB were also decreased in hippocampus of the chronic CTZ <b>seizure</b> rats. Our results indicate that CTZ induced <b>seizure</b> is capable of developing to have recurrent <b>seizure,</b> and the decreased GABA synthesis and transport as well as the impaired BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway may {{contribute to the development of}} the recurrent <b>seizure.</b> Thus, CTZ <b>seizure</b> rats may provide a novel animal model for epilepsy study and anticonvulsant drug testing in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} of <b>seizure</b> thresholds in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains problematic.

One-hundred ECT treatments were evaluated in 16 adult patients diagnosed with depression. BIS scores were recorded at the preanesthetic and preictal periods and at recovery from ECT. <b>Seizure</b> duration was defined as the duration of the electroencephalogram <b>seizure</b> pattern.

5|$|Diagnosis of {{epilepsy}} can be difficult. A {{number of}} other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to <b>seizures,</b> including syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic <b>seizures</b> (PNES). In particular a syncope can {{be accompanied by a}} short episode of convulsions. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic <b>seizures.</b> The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy cannot {{usually be}} cured, but {{medication}} can control <b>seizures</b> effectively in about 70% of cases. Of those with generalized <b>seizures,</b> more than 80% can be well controlled with medications {{while this is}} true in only 50% of people with focal <b>seizures.</b> One predictor of long-term outcome {{is the number of}} <b>seizures</b> that occur in the first six months. Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment, generalized <b>seizures,</b> a family history of epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity. In the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated. In Africa, 90% do not get treatment. This is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy is a {{group of}} {{neurological}} disorders characterized by epileptic <b>seizures.</b> Epileptic <b>seizures</b> are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, <b>seizures</b> tend to recur and as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated <b>seizures</b> that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition.|$|E
50|$|PDE {{also are}} {{important}} in <b>seizure</b> incidence. For example, PDE compromised the antiepileptic activity of adenosine. In addition, using of a PDE inhibitor (pentoxifylline) in pentylenetetrazole-induced <b>seizure</b> indicated the antiepileptic effect by increasing the time latency to <b>seizure</b> incidence and decreasing the <b>seizure</b> duration in vivo.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, we {{organize}} the paper as follows. We first begin {{by the most}} common methods for <b>seizure</b> detection and prediction: time-domain methods, which are addressed in Section 1.2. Section 1.3 is devoted to frequency-domain <b>seizure</b> detection methods. Wavelet-domain <b>seizure</b> detection and prediction methods are covered in Section 1.4. Sections 1.5 and 1.6 are devoted for <b>seizure</b> detection methods {{that are based on}} the EMD and the SVD, respectively.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{translate}} and validate the Liverpool <b>Seizure</b> Severity Scale (LSSS) in Chinese-speaking patients with epilepsy {{and explore the}} determinants of <b>seizure</b> severity in China. Methods: Accepted procedures were followed to translate the LSSS. Each participant was interviewed to complete the LSSS, <b>Seizure</b> Severity Index, Quality of Well-being Scale Self-Administered (QWB-SA), EuroQol (EQ- 5 D), and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Construct validity and internal consistency were assessed. The determinants of <b>seizure</b> severity were explored. Results: The {{construct validity of the}} LSSS was demonstrated by good convergent and discriminant validities. Cronbach's alpha and the intraclass correlation coefficient were 0. 886, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, <b>seizure</b> types (p = 0. 001), <b>seizure</b> frequency (p = 0. 001), and numbers of antiepileptic drugs (p = 0. 042) predicted the scores on the LSSS. Types of antiepileptic drugs also contributed to the variation in the LSSS scores. Conclusions: Chinese LSSS is a valid, reliable, and sensitive <b>seizure</b> severity scale. <b>Seizure</b> frequency, <b>seizure</b> types, and quantities and types of AEDs predict <b>seizure</b> severity...|$|R

40|$|Although a <b>seizure</b> event {{represents}} a major deviation from a baseline electroencephalographic signal, there are features of <b>seizure</b> morphology {{that can be}} seen in non-epileptic portions of the record. A transient decrease in frequency, referred to as slowing, is a generally abnormal but not necessarily epileptic EEG variant. <b>Seizure</b> termination is often associated with a period of slowing between the period of peak amplitude and frequency of the <b>seizure</b> and the return to baseline. In annotation of <b>seizure</b> events in the TUH EEG <b>Seizure</b> Corpus, independent slowing events were identified as a major source of false alarm error. Preliminary results demonstrated the difficulty in automatic differentiation between <b>seizure</b> events and independent slowing events. The TUH EEG Slowing database, a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus, was created, and is introduced here, to aid {{in the development of a}} <b>seizure</b> detection tool that can differentiate between slowing at the end of a <b>seizure</b> and an independent non-seizure slowing event.
