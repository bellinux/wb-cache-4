The first skyscrapers in Chicago and New York had been designed in a neo-gothic or neoclassical style, but these buildings were very different; they combined modern materials and technology (stainless steel, concrete, aluminum, chrome-plated steel) with Art Deco geometry; stylized zig-zags, lightning flashes, fountains, sunrises, and, {{at the top of}} the Chrysler building, Art Deco [...] "gargoyles" [...] in the form of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>radiator</b> ornaments. The interiors of these new buildings, sometimes termed Cathedrals of Commerce", were lavishly decorated in bright contrasting colors, with geometric patterns variously influenced by Egyptian and Mayan pyramids, African textile patterns, and European cathedrals, Frank Lloyd Wright himself experimented with Mayan Revival, in the concrete cube-based Ennis House of 1924 in Los Angeles.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 1999 Ülkemizdeki ısıtma sistemlerinde doğal gazın yakıt olarak kullanılmaya başlanması ile birlikte bireysel ısıtma daha fazla tercih edilen bir uygulama haline gelirken radyatör kullanımında da önemli artışlar olmuştur. Bireysel ve merkezi ısıtma uygulamalarında değişik malzemelerden ve değişik tiplerde radyatörler kullanılmaktadır. Radyatör seçimindeki önemli kriterler maliyet, birim ısıl verim, kullanım ömrü, ısıtma sistemlerine uygunluğu ve rejime girme süreleridir. Enerji tasarrufu sağlaması açısından radyatörlerin rejime girme süreleri, seçilen ısıtma sistemine uygunluk ve birim ısıl verimleri son derece önemlidir. Bu çalışmada ısıtma cihazlarının ısıl davranışları incelenmiş farklı malzemelerdeki radyatör tipleri için {{transfer}} fonksiyonları çıkartılarak, bu fonksiyonların zaman sabitleri hesaplanmıştır. Sıcak su panel radyatöre girdiğinde, radyatörün kanalları içinde soğumakta olan suyla, arasında bir miktar karışma meydana gelecektir. Mükemmel karışımın belirtisi su sıcaklığının radyatör boyunca aynı sıcaklıkta olmasıdır. Panel radyatörün ısıl reaksiyonu;As {{the individual}} heating becomes a more preferred application within {{the beginning of}} natural gas usage at the heating systems in our country, there also have been increases in radiator using. Radiators of different materials and with different types are being used in individual and central heating. The most important creations in radiator selection is cost, thermal output per unit, life time, appropriateness to heating system and time constant. Time constant, appropriateness to the heating system chosen and thermal output per unit are very important {{in the case of}} saving energy. With this work, the thermal attitudes of heating equipment have been examined and the time constants of transfer functions found for the radiators of different types have been calculated. When hot water enters a panel radiator some mixing will occur between it and water already cooling in radiator's channels. The symptom of perfect mixing would be that the water temperature throughout the radiator. The equation for the thermal response of the panel radiator; CR =mwater cwater + mmetal cmetal Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; In some designs of low water content radiator, the radiator channels consist in fact of a small number of pipes bonded to the convector surface. Very little mixing would be expected to take place in such an arrangement. The equation for the thermal response of the aluminum radiator; Cm: Thermal capacity of metal = mmetal cmetal Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; In the much older column radiator the thermal mass of iron columns may not be correctly modeled by simply aggregating it with the water content as was inferred earlier for the <b>steel</b> panel <b>radiator.</b> In effect this gives two equations describing the radiator dynamics; Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; The risk of instability and system gain had been examined by comparing radiator output at different flow temperatures. The risk of instability therefore occurs at low load condition. The risk can be reduced by separately reducing the flow temperatures in accordance with external load. In addition to this it was given transfer function at fluctuations in water flow rate and fluctuations flow temperature by examining behavior of coils, embedded heating panels. For fluctuations in water flow rate: For fluctuations in water flow temperature: (? = ?c 0 / v) The BSRIA model estimates these time constants on the basis of length of tubes per circuit actively transferring heat, the number of tubes per header, the water velocity in the tube and the air velocity through the heat exchanger. It has been seen that the time constants of aluminum radiators are shorter than the other radiator types. Panel, iron and <b>steel</b> <b>radiators</b> are following aluminum radiators. Radiators, which have shorter time constant, will be adept to any changes in the systems. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
5000|$|The quarter Weiskirchen of Rodgau is since 1967 {{location}} of a medium-wave transmitter of the Hessian broadcasting company for the frequency 594 kHz. Until the conversion of medium-wave transmission frequencies to by nine divisible kilohertz values according to the wave plan of Geneva wave in 1978, its transmission frequency was 593 kHz. Until 1994 the transmitting power was 400 kW.In 1994, it was reduced to 300 kW. Weiskirchen transmitter has a directional antenna, which consists of two 126.5-metre-tall guyed lattice <b>steel</b> mast <b>radiators</b> (coordinates: [...] and [...] ) insulated against ground. In opposite to other guyed masts used for medium wave transmission, its guys are not partitioned with insulators. Instead they are grounded over coils situated directly close to the anchor block, which are so tuned, that high frequency currents in the guys are as low as possible.One avoids by this guy construction expansive maintenance work at surge arresters at insulators partitioning the guys. The Weiskirchen transmitter forms together with Hoher Meissner transmitter a single frequency network. The directive pattern of the transmitter has a maximum toward northwest and two minima pointing toward northeast and southeast. By regulation of the feeding power for each mast, the directivity pattern can be changed, in cooperation with Hoher Meissner transmitter the maximum even to the east.|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{transformers}} {{are vital}} components found virtually in most power-operated equipments. These transformers spontaneously radiate heat in both operation and steady-state mode. Should this thermal radiation inherent in transformers rises above allowable threshold {{a reduction in}} efficiency of operation occurs. In addition, this could cause other components in the system to malfunction. The aim of this work is to detect the remote causes of this undesirable thermal rise in transformers such as oil distribution transformers and ways to control this prevailing thermal problem. Oil transformers consist of these components: windings usually made of copper or aluminum conductor, the core normally made of silicon <b>steel,</b> the heat <b>radiators,</b> and the dielectric materials such as transformer oil, cellulose insulators and other peripherals. The Resistor-Inductor-Capacitor Thermal Network (RLCTN) model at architectural level identifies with these components to have ensemble operational mode as oil transformer. The Inductor represents the windings, the Resistor representing the core and the Capacitor represents the dielectrics. Thermography of transformer under various loading conditions was analyzed base on Infrared thermal gradient. Mathematical, experimental, and simulation results gotten through RLCTN with respect to time and thermal image analysis proved that the capacitance of the dielectric is inversely proportional to the thermal rise. </p...|$|R
