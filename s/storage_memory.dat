This model is 20% thinner and 15% lighter compared to the original model, has an additional hour of battery life, an LCD instead of OLED, includes a micro USB Type B port, 1GB of internal <b>storage</b> <b>memory.</b> It was released in Japan on October 10, 2013 in six colors: white, black, pink, yellow, blue, and olive green, and in North America on May 6, 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Another key {{aspect of}} the Mars Express mission is the Mars Express AI Tool (MEXAR2). [...] The {{primary purpose of the}} AI tool is the {{scheduling}} of when to download various parts of the collected scientific data back to Earth, a process which used to take ground controllers a significant amount of time. [...] The new AI tool saves operator time, optimizes bandwidth use on the DSN, prevents data loss, and allows better use of the DSN for other space operations as well. [...] The AI decides how to manage the spacecraft's 12 gigabits of <b>storage</b> <b>memory,</b> when the DSN will be available and not be in use by another mission, how to make the best use of the DSN bandwidth allocated to it, and when the spacecraft will be oriented properly to transmit back to Earth.|$|E
