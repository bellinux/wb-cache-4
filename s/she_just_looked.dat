60|$|Katie was {{standing}} {{looking out of}} the window. She turned as the door opened, and then she saw Andy. Her lips parted, {{as if she was}} going to say something, but she didn't say nothing.

6000|$|On A bright sunshiny day, {{with the}} breeze chasing her smoke far ahead, the Nan-Shan came into Fu-chau.

6000|$|... "Oh! I see. No, I am sure it {{was nothing}} of that sort. Mary won't be bothered with young men. She is too lazy; <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> over their heads till they get tired and go away. I am {{sure it was}} the packing, or, perhaps, the party. But what are you staring at, Colonel?

6000|$|... "O heavenly, heavenly flowers!" [...] exclaimed Miss Sharp, and smelt them delicately, {{and held}} them to her bosom, and cast up {{her eyes to the}} ceiling, in an ecstasy of admiration. Perhaps <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> first into the bouquet, to see whether there was a billet-doux hidden among the flowers; but there was no letter.|$|E

[...] "I {{stood like}} a stuffed calf. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> back once, you know, and stood smiling like and crying--I {{could see the}} shine of her eyes--and then she was gone, and there was all these little fellows bustling about me, {{stuffing}} my 'ands and my pockets {{and the back of}} my collar and everywhere with gold." ...|$|E

Cheerful society would be of use; you should be as little alone as possible; you should take plenty of exercise." ...|$|R
50|$|The revenue officer {{returns and}} is shocked {{to hear that}} Jimmy is getting married that afternoon, since he saw him with his wife the {{previous}} night. Kay is trying on one of Constance's gowns, and, since she does {{not look like a}} maid anymore, she and Shorty convince the revenue officer that she is Jimmy's wife. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> like Jane the maid; Dolly and Phyllis demonstrate that two people can look alike.|$|R
2500|$|The {{tendency}} to read thematic or narrative content into Hopper's paintings, that Hopper had not intended, extended even to his wife.

No, Sir, you can't fool old Mother Nature. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at Mr. Owl and {{she looked}} at the {{feathers}} and fur scattered about the foot of the dead stump. Mr. Owl stood first on one foot and then on the other. He tried to look old Mother Nature in the face, but he couldn't. You see, Mr. Owl had a guilty conscience and a guilty conscience never looks anyone straight in the face. He did wish that Mother Nature would say something, did Mr. Owl. But she didn't. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> and looked and looked and looked straight at Mr. Owl. The longer she looked the uneasier he got and the faster he shifted {{from one foot to the}} other. Finally he shifted so fast that he seemed to be dancing on top of the old stump.|$|E
6000|$|As {{soon as he}} {{had said}} it he had himself heard the pity in it. His telling her she had [...] "everything" [...] was extravagant kind humour, whereas his knowing so tenderly that she didn't {{complain}} was terrible kind gravity. Milly felt, he could see, the difference; {{he might as well}} have praised her outright for looking death in the face. This was the way <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> him again, and it was of no attenuation that she took him up more gently than ever. [...] "It isn't a merit--when one sees one's way." ...|$|E

I can see her now coming towards us. There were so many people around that she had to risk everything. Oh, it was a great moment for mother! She never troubled even to raise her lorgnettes. She never attempted any of that glaring-through-you sort of business. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> up at Mrs. Carraby's hand and looked up at her eyes and walked by without changing a muscle.

One o' the guides of the Saskatchewan brigade had his daughter with him. The guide was a French-Canadian, {{and his wife had}} been a Scotch half-caste, so what the daughter was is more than I can tell; but I know what she looked like. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> like an angel. It wasn't so much that she was pretty, but she was so sweet, and so quiet lookin', and so innocent! Well, to cut the matter short, I fell in love at once.

Of course, it was very becoming; but somehow it seemed too {{elaborate}} and fussy for church going and our quiet little doings in the Glen--too conspicuous, in short. It hadn't seemed so at the milliner's but here in my little white room it did. And that dreadful price tag! And the starving Belgians! When mother saw the hat and the tag <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at me. Mother is some expert at looking. Father says she looked him into love with her years ago in Avonlea school and I can well believe it--though I have heard a weird tale of her banging him {{over the head with}} a slate {{at the very beginning of}} their acquaintance. Mother was a limb when she was a little girl, I understand, and even up to the time when Jem went away she was full of ginger. But let me return to my mutton--that is to say, my new green velvet hat.|$|E

[...] "I was down at Spruce Cove one night last summer when a big thunderstorm came up. I went to Naomi's house for shelter. The door was open, so I walked right in, because nobody answered my knock. Naomi Clark was at the window, watching the cloud coming up over the sea. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at me once, but didn't say anything, {{and then went on}} watching the cloud. I didn't like to sit down because she hadn't asked me to, so I went to the window by her and watched it, too. It was a dreadful sight--the cloud was so black and the water so green, and there was such a strange light between the cloud and the water; yet there was something splendid in it, too. Part of the time I watched the storm, and the other part I watched Naomi's face. It was dreadful to see, like the storm, and yet I liked to see it.|$|E

"My {{birthday}} is next week," [...] said Paul, {{as they walked}} up the long red hill, basking in the June sunshine, [...] "and father wrote me that he is sending me something that he thinks I'll like better than anything else he could send. I believe it has come already, for Grandma is keeping the bookcase drawer locked {{and that is something}} new.

You'd never think it to look at me, would you? Grandma says I'm very small for my age and that it's all because I don't eat enough porridge. I do my very best, but Grandma gives such generous platefuls [...] . there's nothing mean about Grandma, I can tell you. Ever since you and I had that talk about praying going home from Sunday School that day, teacher [...] . when you said we ought to pray about all our difficulties [...] . I've prayed every night that God would give me enough grace to enable me to eat every bit of my porridge in the mornings. But I've never been able to do it yet, and whether it's because I have too little grace or too much porridge I really can't decide. Grandma says father was brought up on porridge, and it certainly did work well in his case, for you ought to see the shoulders he has.

6000|$|... "That was the {{position}} yesterday, after the Minerva with the fugitive President {{had gone out}} of harbour, and the rioters had been driven back into the side lanes of the town. I sat {{on the steps of the}} cathedral with Nostromo, after sending out the cable message for the information of a more or less attentive world. Strangely enough, though the offices of the Cable Company are in the same building as the Porvenir, the mob, which has thrown my presses out of the window and scattered the type all over the Plaza, has been kept from interfering with the instruments on the other side of the courtyard. As I sat talking with Nostromo, Bernhardt, the telegraphist, came out from under the Arcades with a piece of paper in his hand. The little man had tied himself up to an enormous sword and was hung all over with revolvers. He is ridiculous, but the bravest German of his size that ever tapped the key of a Morse transmitter. He had received the message from Cayta reporting the transports with Barrios's army just entering the port, and ending with the words, 'The greatest enthusiasm prevails.' I walked off to drink some water at the fountain, and I was shot at from the Alameda by somebody hiding behind a tree. But I drank, and didn't care; with Barrios in Cayta and the great Cordillera between us and Montero's victorious army I seemed, notwithstanding Messrs. Gamacho and Fuentes, to hold my new State in the hollow of my hand. I was ready to sleep, but when I got as far as the Casa Gould I found the patio full of wounded laid out on straw. Lights were burning, and in that enclosed courtyard on that hot night a faint odour of chloroform and blood hung about. At one end Doctor Monygham, the doctor of the mine, was dressing the wounds; at the other, near the stairs, Father Corbelan, kneeling, listened to the confession of a dying Cargador. Mrs. Gould was walking about through these shambles with a large bottle in one hand and a lot of cotton wool in the other. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> at me and never even winked. Her camerista was following her, also holding a bottle, and sobbing gently to herself.|$|E

While [...] "lying on some hunk's chest", <b>she's</b> <b>just</b> {{chilling}} and [...] "looking for love", mostly [...] "a one-night stand," [...] as stated by Digital Spy's Lewis Corner and seen in the lines: [...] "I just broke up with my ex, now I'm out here single/ I don't really know what's next, but I ain't even tripping, I'ma chill and sit back/ I know they'll be coming from {{the right and the}} left, left, left." [...] Wayne responds to her verses with what was considered [...] "catchy word play", such as [...] "she's grinding on this Grande," [...] which turns the singer's last name into a sexual innuendo.

5000|$|Coddington {{was born}} on April 20, 1941 to hotelier parents {{on the island of}} Anglesey, Wales.

[...] Coddington lived many miles away from any designer shops, so Vogue was her only connection to the fashion world. She says that she loves [...] "the whole sort of chic thing ("Italianate culture") Vogue that was so entirely out of context compared to the lifestyle that she led."

5000|$|The visuals of [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] became distinctive, {{particularly}} the green lasers {{appearing in the}} background, and the crystals Lopez wore on her body.

[...] Maitri Mehta of Bustle magazine wrote that she was [...] "mesmerized by a vision of a bronze J. Lo gettin' life from those green lasers. In almost all of her music videos, J.

[...] American Idol alumnus Adam Lambert revealed, [...] "I remember when I was a kid graduating high school and 'Waiting for Tonight' came out (...)

Diane Cho of VH1 noted that Lopez [...] "trademarked" [...] the glitter-look in [...] "Waiting for Tonight", which was adapted by Britney Spears in [...] "Toxic" [...] and Beyoncé in [...] "1+1".|$|E
