40|$|The {{robustness}} of {{the delivery}} of digital compressed video streams {{has always been one}} of the main topic of the standardization bodies to assure the Quality of the Service (QoS). The MPEG standard which is nowadays the reference for digital television defines how to format the various component parts of a multimedia program and how they are combined into a single transmission bit stream. Although the MPEG stream may be directly used over a wide variety of media, it may also be used over a communication network and it is already packetized into short data packets. The multiplexed stream can be transmitted over a variety of communication networks such as Radio Frequency links (UHF/VHF), Digital Satellite links, Cable TV Networks, Standard Terrestrial Communication Links (PDH, SDH) or Packet/Cell Links (ATM, IP, IPv 6, Ethernet). In critical and error prone channels the robustness of the stream has to be granted by employing strong error correction schemes. Depending on the used media the transmission has its own coding scheme and modulation methods designed for the particular environment. For example, in the case of IP based links the transfer protocol accepts loss of data and the problem can be easily overcome by retransmission. Wireless <b>simplex</b> <b>transmission</b> cannot exploit the same approach. Wireless transmission always means variable channel conditions especially when one or both terminals are moving on the outfield. The channel fading evolution and the signal impairments increase the error rate and corrupt the data. In the recent past the standardization of the DVB-T shows the possibility to provide a robust service for digital video delivery. This standard provides superior picture quality with the opportunity to view pictures in standard format or wide screen (4 / 3 or 16 / 9) formats, services including subtitling, multiple audio tracks, interactive content, multimedia content where, for instance, programs may be linked to world wide web material. Beside the provided services and features the standard offers also a modulation and transmission scheme capable to cope with the impairments of the terrestrial channel and to provide a BER after forward-error correction below 10 - 12. Unfortunately, these performances are guaranteed only for fixed reception, since the standard was originally aimed to replace classical analog television broadcasting in the UHF band. This thesis addresses the study of enhanced error-correction schemes in the scope of a compact, flexible and robust high-throughput real time video transmission system able to cope with high mobility channels. The study of a transmission system and error correction scheme tailored for this kind of application is here presented. The system exploits the OFDM modulation technique. This modulation scheme has already proven to be very effective in hostile environments. A flexible modulation scheme is employed to obtain variable bandwidth transmission and enhanced performances especially for mobile applications. The main topic of this research is the study of an effective error correction scheme adapted to this application. While nowadays the digital television standards use a concatenated error correction scheme based on convolutional inner coder, in this work the proposed solution is based on a turbo inner coder. Turbo codes has already shown good performances compared to convolutional codes. These results are here applied to a concatenated scheme to obtain very low BER. A comparison of the performances of various turbo coding techniques under certain implementation constraints is done in this work. The second element of the error correction scheme is the channel interleaver used to average the channel fading in time and frequency. This mechanism is conceived to be adapted to the modulated bandwidth and is optimized for high throughput real time video. This study shows that the proposed system proves to be very effective in high mobile channels because of the deep averaging strategies in conjunction with the high efficiency turbo based concatenated error correction scheme...|$|E

To synchronize between two identical chaotic systems with different initial conditions, a drive and response system model is constructed according to Pecora and Carroll’s theory. Synchronization can be achieved for optical <b>simplex</b> and duplex <b>transmissions</b> provided that the conditional Lyapunov exponents for the drive and response systems are all negative.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs more often in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is transmitted by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women. BV often occurs in both partners in a lesbian relationship; a recent study of women with BV found that 81% had partners with BV. Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions; the highest rate of transmission of HIV to women is among those who have sexual intercourse with men or participate in intravenous drug use.|$|R
40|$|Background:While {{most recent}} {{evidence}} {{does not support}} a role for pregnancy in accelerating HIV disease progression, very little information {{is available on the}} effects of incident pregnancy in response to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Hormonal, immune, and behavioral changes during pregnancy may influence response to ART. We sought to explore the effects of incident pregnancy (after ART initiation) on virologic, immunologic, and clinical response to ART. Methods:Data were collected from HIV-infected women participating in 3 prospective studies (Partners in Prevention Herpes <b>simplex</b> virus/HIV <b>Transmission</b> Study, Couples Observational Study, and Partners Preexposure Prophylaxis Study) from 7 countries in Africa from 2004 to 2012. Women were included in this analysis if they were 22 ̆ 030445 years of age, were started on ART during the study and were not pregnant at ART initiation. Pregnancy was treated as a time-dependent exposure variable covering the duration of pregnancy, including all pregnancies occurring after ART initiation. Virologic failure was defined as a viral load (VL) greater than 400 copies per milliliter 22 ̆ 03056 months after ART initiation and viral suppression was defined as VL 22 ̆ 0304400 copies per milliliter. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between pregnancy and time to viral suppression, virologic failure, World Health Organization clinical stage III/IV, and death. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the association between pregnancy and CD 4 + count and VL. All analyses were adjusted for confounders, including pre-ART CD 4 + count and plasma VL.

Method Thirteen microsatellite markers, spanning a 47 -centimorgan genomic region on 16 q 22 -q 24 were evaluated for linkage to T 1 D in 98 Russian multiplex families. Multipoint logarithm of odds (LOD) ratio (MLS) and nonparametric LOD (NPL) values were computed for each marker, using GENEHUNTER 2. 1 software. Four microsatellites (D 16 S 422, D 16 S 504, D 16 S 3037, and D 16 S 3098) and 6 biallelic markers in 2 positional candidate genes, ICSBP 1 and NQO 1, were additionally tested for association with T 1 D in 114 <b>simplex</b> families, using <b>transmission</b> disequilibrium test (TDT). Results A peak of linkage (MLS = 1. 35, NPL = 0. 91) was shown for marker D 16 S 750, {{but this was not}} significant (P = 0. 18). The subsequent linkage analysis in the subset of 46 multiplex families carrying a common risk HLA-DR 4 haplotype increased peak MLS and NPL values to 1. 77 and 1. 22, respectively, but showed no significant linkage (P = 0. 11) to T 1 D in the 16 q 22 -q 24 genomic region. TDT analysis failed to find significant association between these markers and disease, even after the conditioning for the predisposing HLA-DR 4 haplotype.

40|$|Juvenile {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (JRA) comprises {{a group of}} chronic systemic inflammatory disorders that primarily affect joints and can cause long-term disability. JRA {{is likely to be}} a complex genetic trait, or a series of such traits, with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to the risk for developing the disease and to its progression. The HLA region on the short arm of chromosome 6 has been intensively evaluated for genetic contributors to JRA, and multiple associations, and more recently linkage, has been detected. Other genes involved in innate and acquired immunity also map to near the HLA cluster on 6 p, and it is possible that variation within these genes also confers risk for developing JRA. We examined the TPSN gene, which encodes tapasin, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone that is involved in antigen processing, to elucidate its involvement, if any, in JRA. We employed both a case–control approach and the transmission disequilibrium test, and found linkage and association between the TPSN allele (Arg 260) and the systemic onset subtype of JRA. Two independent JRA cohorts were used, one recruited from the Rheumatology Clinic at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (82 simplex families) and one collected by the British Paediatric Rheumatology Group in London, England (74 <b>simplex</b> families). The <b>transmission</b> disequilibrium test for these cohorts combined was statistically significant (χ 2 = 4. 2, one degree of freedom; P = 0. 04). Linkage disequilibrium testing between the HLA alleles that are known to be associated with systemic onset JRA did not reveal linkage disequilibrium with the Arg 260 allele, either in the Cincinnati systemic onset JRA cohort or in 113 Caucasian healthy individuals. These results suggest that there is a weak association between systemic onset JRA and the TPSN polymorphism, possibly due to linkage disequilibrium with an as yet unknown susceptibility allele in the centromeric part of chromosome 6...|$|R
