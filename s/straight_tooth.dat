5000|$|Jaw {{couplings}} {{are available}} in both <b>straight</b> <b>tooth</b> jaw and curved jaw design. The <b>straight</b> <b>tooth</b> design enables elastomers to be attached and removed radially, including a [...] "not fail-safe" [...] jaw elastomer in-shear design. For the elastomer in-shear design, the coupling hub teeth are no longer inter-meshed, so a elastomer failure will result in no torque being transmitted. When used with a stiff elastomer, the curved jaw design can maintain a zero-backlash fit required for many motion control applications.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the spiral tooth over the <b>straight</b> <b>tooth</b> is that they engage more gradually. The contact between the teeth starts {{at one end of}} the gear and then spreads across the whole tooth. This results in a less abrupt transfer of force when a new pair of teeth come into play. With straight bevel gears, the abrupt tooth engagement causes noise, especially at high speeds, and impact stress on the teeth which makes them unable to take heavy loads at high speeds without breaking. For these reasons straight bevel gears are generally limited to use at linear speeds less than 1000 feet/min; or, for small gears, under 1000 r.p.m.|$|E
50|$|An {{adjustable}} {{hand reamer}} can cover a small range of sizes. They are generally referenced by a letter which equates to a size range. The disposable blades slide along a tapered groove. The act of tightening and loosening the restraining nuts {{at each end}} varies the size that may be cut. The absence of any spiral in the flutes restricts them to light usage (minimal material removal per setting) as they {{have a tendency to}} chatter. They are also restricted to usage in unbroken holes. If a hole has an axial split along it, such as a split bush or a clamping hole, each <b>straight</b> <b>tooth</b> will in turn drop into the gap causing the other teeth to retract from their cutting position. This also gives rise to chatter marks and defeats the purpose of using the reamer to size a hole.|$|E

40|$|A gear is a {{rotating}} machine part having cut tooth, which mesh with another toothed part {{in order to}} transmit torque. Gears are mainly type like spur gears, helical gears, double helical gears, bevel gears, crown gears, hypoid gears, worm gears, rack and pinion, epicyclic gears etc. The application of these gears fled from tiny wrist watches to huge machinery equipment gears from vital elements of mechanism in many machines such as automobile, aerospace industry, rolling mills, hoisting and transmitting machinery, marine engines, and the like. Parallel and co-planer shaft connected by gears are known as spur gear. Spur gear have <b>straight</b> <b>tooth</b> and are parallel to the axis of the wheel. Spur gears are {{most common type of}} gears. A pair of spur gear tooth in action is generally subjected to two types of cyclic stress: contact stress and bending stress including bending fatigue. Both stress may not attain their maximum values at the same point of contact fatigue. These types of failure can be minimized by analysis of the problem during the design stage and creating proper tooth surface profile with proper manufacturing methods. In this paper using ansys work bench software, bending stress, contact stress and static load on the tooth of spur gear drive is found...|$|E

25|$|Until recently, Pliohippus was {{believed}} to be the ancestor of present-day horses because of its many anatomical similarities. However, though Pliohippus was clearly a close relative of Equus, its skull had deep facial fossae, whereas Equus had no fossae at all. Additionally, its teeth were strongly curved, unlike the very <b>straight</b> <b>teeth</b> of modern horses. Consequently, it is unlikely to be the ancestor of the modern horse; instead, it is a likely candidate for the ancestor of Astrohippus.|$|R
40|$|The crania of Canis latrans (coyote) and Canis familiaris (dog) are morphologically {{similar and}} can be {{confusing}} when trying to differentiate between the two. Dogs and coyotes have similar origins that {{go back into the}} Oligocene. The hespaeocyon is the extinct creature that gave rise to all canids (Colbert 1958 : 68). Hence, many canid skulls look very similar in structure. There is a definite distinction between dogs and other canids. In compared patterns of intracranial allometry and morphological diversity between domestic dog and wild canid species, domestic dogs were shown to be morphologically distinct from all others except wolf like canids (Wayne 1985 : 247). Dogs having a similarity to wolflike canids {{can be explained by the}} theory that dogs are descended from wolves. Some of the morphological changes that occurred in the domestication are size reduction, shortening of facial region, and paedomorphism (retention of juvenile characteristics) (Morey 1992 : 182). Coyotes evolved separately from wolves and dogs. Coyotes are more related to foxes than wolves and a have a more generalized biology than the other canid counterparts. They have narrower skulls than wolves and the jaws have not developed as wide as the wolves, which, in the case of dogs compromises gripping power (Nowak 1978 : 5). In his paper "Distinction between the skulls of coyotes and dogs," Krantz (1959) gives an excellent description of gross morphological differences between dogs and coyotes. The Coyote has the following characteristics [...] A longer narrower muzzle, small frontal sinus, s-shaped zygo-maxillary suture, a vertical posterior border of coronoid process, a plane of palate that would miss skull if extended, the space between the auditory bulla is narrower than either bulla, internal nares are in line or slightly forward of second molars, the anterior palatine foramen is three or four times long as it is wide, the lower first molar rear cusp is the same size as the other two, the second, third, and fourth premolars are three times long as they are wide, and the coyote has a <b>straight</b> <b>tooth</b> row. The dog has a shorter wider snout, tooth row that bends outward, often has teeth missing, pronounced bulge over occipital orbits, straight zygo-maxillary suture, the posterior coronoid process extends backwards at the tip, the plane ofthe palate would hit the skull, the space between the auditory bulla are wider than the bulla, internal nare usually extend to a point behind second molars, anterior palatine foramen two times as long as it is wide, lower first molar rear cusps differ in size, and the second, third, and fourth premolars are three times long as they are wide. Craniometric differences exist as well. If the molar tooth row is 3. 1 or more times that of a palatal width, the specimen is a coyote. If the molar tooth row is 2. 7 times or less, the specimen is a dog. (Howard 1949 : 170) Despite all these differences confusion may still arise when differentiating between the two species, especially if the cranium is incomplete, or if the characteristics look like they could belong to dog or coyote. More craniometric evaluations may be utilized to establish mathematical guidelines for distinguishing the two species and the evolutionary processes. Additional indexes would be helpful in defining the correct species and establishing evolutionary relationships...|$|E

50|$|The {{teeth of}} Guidraco are very distinctive. Of the twenty-three {{teeth of the}} upper jaw the first is long and very narrow, {{pointing}} nearly horizontally forward. The next three teeth are enormous in size, very long, robust, pointed and slightly recurved. They gradually point more downwards. These are followed {{by a series of}} three medium-length downward-pointing <b>straight</b> <b>teeth,</b> of which the middle one, the sixth, is the shortest. The remaining thirteen teeth constitute a long row of small elements gradually diminishing in size. This arrangement is mirrored by the eighteen teeth of the lower jaw.

Next is a series of three <b>straight</b> <b>teeth</b> of medium height, followed by a row of eleven increasingly smaller elements for a grand total in the head of eighty-two teeth. With the fossil, the beak is closed and due to their extreme length the front teeth extend far beyond the upper and lower edges of the head, the protruding parts being up to twice as long as the depth of the snout or lower jaw. The teeth can also be divided into two types according to their built: the first nine teeth of the upper jaw and eight teeth of the lower jaw have vertical ridges on the back of their enamel; the back teeth have a uniformly smooth enamel and thickened crown bases, giving them a more triangular outline.|$|R
