Prospecting potential mining sites, a vital area of concern for the mining industry, is now done using sophisticated new technologies such as <b>seismic</b> <b>prospecting</b> and remote-sensing satellites. Mining is heavily affected by the prices of the commodity minerals, which are often volatile. The 2000s commodities boom ("commodities supercycle") increased the prices of commodities, driving aggressive mining. In addition, the price of gold increased dramatically in the 2000s, which increased gold mining; for example, one study found that conversion of forest in the Amazon increased six-fold from the period 2003–2006 (292 ha/yr) to the period 2006–2009 (1,915 ha/yr), largely due to artisanal mining.|$|E

40|$|Surface {{exploration}} {{techniques have}} been employed in separate study {{areas on the}} Fort Peck Reservation in northeastern Montana. Anomalies associated with hydrocarbon seepage are documented in all three areas {{and a variety of}} surface exploration techniques can be compared. In a small area with established production, Head Gas and Thermal Desorption methods best match production; other methods also map depletion. In a moderate-size area that has prospects defined by 3 D seismic data, Head Gas along with Microbial, Iodine, and Eh soil anomalies are all associated with the best hydrocarbon prospect. In a large area that contains many curvilinear patterns observed on Landsat images, that could represent micro-seepage chimneys, results are inconclusive. Reconnaissance mapping using Magnetic Susceptibility has identified a potential prospect; subsequent Soil Gas and Head Gas surveys suggest hydrocarbon potential. In the final year of this project the principle contractor, the Fort Peck Tribes, completed a second survey in the Wicape 3 D <b>Seismic</b> <b>Prospect</b> Area (also known as Area 6 in Phase I of the project) and sampled several Landsat image features contained in the Smoke Creek Aeromag Anomaly Area (also known as Area 1 in Phase II of the project). Methods determined to be most useful in Phases I and II, were employed in this final Phase III of the study. The Southwest Wicape seismic anomaly was only partially confirmed. The abundant curvilinears proposed to be possible hydrocarbon micro-seepage chimneys in the Smoke Creek Area were not conclusively verified as such. Insufficient sampling of background data precludes affirmative identification of these mostly topographic Landsat features as gas induced soil and vegetation anomalies. However relatively higher light gas concentrations were found associated with some of the curvilinears.

40|$|The Lott Ranch 3 D <b>seismic</b> <b>prospect</b> {{located in}} Garza County, Texas {{is a project}} {{initiated}} in September of 1991 by the J. M. Huber Corp., a petroleum exploration and production company. By today's standards the 126 square mile project does not seem monumental, however {{at the time it}} was conceived it was the most intensive land 3 D project ever attempted. Acquisition began in September of 1991 utilizing GEO-SEISMIC, INC., a seismic data contractor. The field parameters were selected by J. M. Huber, and were of a radical design. The recording instruments used were GeoCor IV amplifiers designed by Geosystems Inc., which record the data in signed bit format. It would not have been practical, if not impossible, to have processed the entire raw volume with the tools available at that time. The end result was a dataset that was thought to have little utility due to difficulties in processing the field data. In 1997, Yates Energy Corp. located in Roswell, New Mexico, formed a partnership to further develop the project. Through discussions and meetings with Pinnacle Seismic, it was determined that the original Lott Ranch 3 D volume could be vastly improved upon reprocessing. Pinnacle Seismic had shown the viability of improving field-summed signed bit data on smaller 2 D and 3 D projects. Yates contracted Pinnacle Seismic Ltd. to perform the reprocessing. This project was initiated with high resolution being a priority. Much of the potential resolution was lost through the initial summing of the field data. Modern computers that are now being utilized have tremendous speed and storage capacities that were cost prohibitive when this data was initially processed. Software updates and capabilities offer a variety of quality control and statics resolution, which are pertinent to the Lott Ranch project. The reprocessing effort was very successful. The resulting processed data-set was then interpreted using modern PC-based interpretation and mapping software. Production data, log data, and scout ticket data were integrated with the 3 D interpretations to evaluate drilling opportunities resulting in an initial three well drilling program. Thousands of miles of signed bit data exist. Much of this data was processed during a time when software and hardware capabilities were either incapable or cost prohibitive to glean the full potential of the data. In fact in some circles signed bit gained an undeserved reputation for being less than optimum. As a consequence much of the older signed bit data sits on the shelf long forgotten or overlooked. With the high cost of new acquisition and permitting it might behoove other exploration companies to reconsider resurrecting perfectly viable existing volumes and have them reprocessed at a fraction of the cost of new acquisition...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation of {{the fluid}} content in deep earth {{reservoirs}} or of fluid contaminants in shallow earth environments has required {{the use of}} geophysical imaging methods such as <b>seismic</b> reflection <b>prospecting.</b> The processing of these seismic data has involved meticulous care in determining the changes in reflected seismic amplitude as the point of observation for the received signals at the earth’s surface is {{moved away from the}} seismic source (Ostrander, 1984). The now commonly used method called AVO (for Amplitude Versus Offset) is based on theories of fluid-saturated and partially saturated rocks that have been available since the 1950 ’s. Here we present a new synthesis of the same physical concepts that uses some of the same data as AVO (compressional wave velocities) together with some different data (shear wave velocities) in a scheme that is much simpler to understand and apply, yet yields the desired information about porosity and fluid saturation. The method is designed especially for near surface applications and for use with crosswell and VSP data, {{but it can also be}} applied to reflection seismic data assuming that reliable interval velocities are available. Since the new method does not require hard-to-obtain wave amplitude information, it can be used for a wider range of seismic source-receiver configurations, including crosswell seismic transmission tomography (well-to-well), vertical seismic profiling (well-to-surface), as well as seismic reflection profiling (surface-to-surface), since reflection data can be used but are not a necessity...|$|R

40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{determining}} the time of origin, depth of focus, and the average velocities from the focus to the surface are described. The first stage in the first method {{is to determine the}} time of origin using a modification of the Wadati method. As was pointed out in 1973 by Kisslinger and Engdahl, the relation between (ts- tp) and tp is nonlinear and it is necessary to allow for this nonlinearity by including a term in tp 2 in the analysis. Thereafter the depth of focus and the average velocity can be found by a modification of the procedure used to determine the depth to a reflector in <b>seismic</b> reflection <b>prospecting.</b> It is necessary to allow for the sphericity of the Earth in this analysis. In the second method, the depth of focus is determined first by analyzing (ts- tp) 2 as a function of x 2, x being the epicentral distance. The average velocity of separation of $ and P waves is also determined at this stage. Thereafter the time of origin and the average P and $ velocities are determined. The results of the analysis of the calculated travel times for three models show that systematic errors in the depth of focus using these procedures are less than 2 km over the depth range of 60 to 640 km. Preliminary results of the analysis of a limited set of Japanese earthquakes by these methods give estimates of depth smaller than those given by ISC for depths less than 300 kin. For deeper earthquakes, these methods give loci deeper than the ISC, but in these cases the observations close to the epicenter are inadequate for reliable analysis...|$|R

The reservoir characterization and the preliminary geothermal potential assessment rely on the geophysical prospect and on the exploration borehole drilled down to 1110 m. These investigations confirmed the existence of an untapped low-enthalpy geothermal reservoir within the Mesozoic carbonate platform buried beneath about 1 km of Paleogene and Neogene sediments, in correspondence of the structural highs along the coastal areas. The well production potential from a fossil, seawater confined aquifer, having a temperature of about 45 - 50 °C, was estimated to be about 140 tons/h. In 2012, as part of the Grado geothermal Project, Phase 2, an integrated gravity and <b>seismic</b> geophysical <b>prospecting,</b> including multi-offset VSPs, was conducted in downtown Grado and in its surrounding lagoon. The target was to extend the investigation of the geothermal reservoir and to provide adequate information on the faults/fracture systems interesting the buried external Dinaric thrust front. The results, here presented, allowed operators to locate the second well of the geothermal doublet, planned to feed the district heating system of public buildings on the island. The drilling of the second borehole is due by June 2014 and the deployment of the main distribution network by September 2014. Borehole geophysics, interference test measurements between the two wells located at distance of one km, and 3 -D thermo-fluid dynamic numerical modeling will optimize the production and fluid re-injection and help to design the heat exchangers and to manage the sustainability of the geothermal plant...|$|R

40|$|Relating seismic {{interpretation}} to reserve/resource calculations: Insights from a DHI consortium In {{the process of}} quantifying resources/reserves, geoscientists attempt to employ all the available pertinent information to produce the most accurate results. The presence of direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHI) on seismic data can {{have a significant impact}} on the reserve/resource calculations not only for volumes, but also uncertainty levels. In 2001 a consortium of oil companies was organized in an attempt to understand seismic amplitude anomalies interpreted as DHIs and their impact on prospect risking and resource calculations (Roden et al., 2005; Forrest et al., 2010). The geologic setting, seismic and rock physics data quality, DHI characteristics, and calibration of drilling results are all incorporated into a database in a consistent and systematic process.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} {{the applicability of}} image processing and pattern recognition techniques to seismic section analysis and interpretation in oil exploration. A seismic section obtained from <b>seismic</b> reflection <b>prospecting</b> is an acoustic image which displays the {{cross section of the}} subsurface structure. The data is employed by the seismic interpreters to infer the probable location of underground resources such as hydrocarbon accumulations. However, the task is labour intensive and must be performed by human experts with sound geological and geophysical knowledge and experience. The interpretation procedure is based on visual inspection, data comparison, geologic reasoning and decision making to confirm any subsurface reserves. Hence, automating the task could have a tremendous impact in terms of speeding up the interpretation task and giving more consistent interpretation results by virtue of minimizing the element of human subjective judgement. Much work is still required to develop an automatic analysis/interpretation system. Moreover, even a partial automation of the interpretation process would bring important productivity benefits. In this context, we limit the scope of investigation herein and place the emphasis on extracting geologic events from seismic images/sections based on perceived textural appearance of the data. We adopt the stance that seismic section data can be perceived as a texture image where the character of each distinct geologic event is manifest in its textural appearance. First we quantify such seismic textures using texture representation techniques suggested in the literature. Based on the representation we develop various methods for extracting important geological events from the data automatically. In this thesis, we propose two new approaches regarding the problems of extracting seismic events at the regional and local scales: Regional scale - Seismic Section Segmentation: Image regions of different textural appearance may represent distinct geologic regions. Thus by segmenting a seismic section into regions of homogeneous textural properties {{it should be possible to}} identify and delimit regions of different seismic and therefore geological character. A supervised segmentation scheme based on the Bayesian decision rule and using a multiresolution data representation is developed and is demonstrated on seismic images with good results. Local scale - Seismic Horizon Extraction: The perceived seismic texture is constituted by seismic horizons which are caused by a change in the acoustic impedance across the subsurface rock layers and are an indication of rock boundaries in the Earth's subsurface. The seismic horizon extraction procedures result in a line map of the subsurface rock boundary structure. However, the continuity of seismic horizons is invariably corrupted by noise and variation of lithology. Hence, we develop a new robust approach using a probabilistic relaxation labelling technique with a view to automatically locate the seismic horizons and preserve their continuity. The significance of the work is twofold: firstly it provides information to the interpreter which supplements or enhances visual information available in the seismic data which otherwise are less obvious and may be ignored. Secondly, it serves as a building block for more advanced automatic analysis/interpretation system...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our research}} was to develop and demonstrate seismic data-acquisition and data-processing technologies that allow geothermal prospects below high-velocity rock outcrops to be evaluated. To do this, we acquired a 3 -component seismic test line across an area of exposed high-velocity rocks in Brewster County, Texas, where there is high heat flow and surface conditions mimic those found at numerous geothermal <b>prospects.</b> <b>Seismic</b> contractors have not succeeded in creating good-quality seismic data in this area for companies who have acquired data {{for oil and gas}} exploitation purposes. Our test profile traversed an area where high-velocity rocks and low-velocity sediment were exposed on the surface in alternating patterns that repeated along the test line. We verified that these surface conditions cause non-ending reverberations of Love waves, Rayleigh waves, and shallow critical refractions to travel across the earth surface between the boundaries of the fast-velocity and slow-velocity material exposed on the surface. These reverberating surface waves form the high level of noise in this area that does not allow reflections from deep interfaces to be seen and utilized. Our data-acquisition method of deploying a box array of closely spaced geophones allowed us to recognize and evaluate these surface-wave noise modes regardless of the azimuth direction to the surface anomaly that backscattered the waves and caused them to return to the test-line profile. With this knowledge of the surface-wave noise, we were able to process these test-line data to create P-P and SH-SH images that were superior to those produced by a skilled seismic data-processing contractor. Compared to the P-P data acquired along the test line, the SH-SH data provided a better detection of faults and could be used to trace these faults upward to the boundaries of exposed surface rocks. We expanded our comparison of the relative value of S-wave and P-wave seismic data for geothermal applications by inserting into this report {{a small part of the}} interpretation we have done with 3 C 3 D data across Wister geothermal field in the Imperial Valley of California. This interpretation shows that P-SV data reveal faults (and by inference, also fractures) that cannot be easily, or confidently, seen with P-P data, and that the combination of P-P and P-SV data allows VP/VS velocity ratios to be estimated across a targeted reservoir interval to show where an interval has more sandstone (the preferred reservoir facies). The conclusion reached from this investigation is that S-wave seismic technology can be invaluable to geothermal operators. Thus we developed a strong interest in understanding the direct-S modes produced by vertical-force sources, particularly vertical vibrators, because if it can be demonstrated that direct-S modes produced by vertical-force sources can be used as effectively as the direct-S modes produced by horizontal-force sources, geothermal operators can acquire direct-S data across many more prospect areas than can be done with horizontal-force sources, which presently are limited to horizontal vibrators. We include some of our preliminary work in evaluating direct-S modes produced by vertical-force sources...|$|R
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This PhD research, {{funded by}} the Swiss Sciences Foundation, is principally devoted to enhance the recognition, the {{visualisation}} and the characterization of geobodies through innovative 3 D seismic approaches. A series of case studies from the Australian North West Shelf ensures the development of reproducible integrated 3 D workflows and gives new insight into local and regional stratigraphic as well as structural issues. This project was initiated in year 2000 at the Geology and Palaeontology Institute of the University of Lausanne (Switzerland). Several collaborations ensured the improvement of technical approaches {{as well as the}} assessment of geological models. - Investigations into the Timor Sea structural style were carried out at the Tectonics Special Research Centre of the University of Western Australia and in collaboration with Woodside Energy in Perth. - Seismic analysis and attributes classification approach were initiated with Schlumberger Oilfield Australia in Perth; assessments and enhancements of the integrated seismic approaches benefited from collaborations with scientists from Schlumberger Stavanger Research (Norway). Adapting and refining from "linear" exploration techniques, a conceptual "helical" 3 D seismic approach has been developed. In order to investigate specific geological issues this approach, integrating seismic attributes and visualisation tools, has been refined and adjusted leading to the development of two specific workflows: - A stratigraphic workflow focused on the recognition of geobodies and the characterization of depositional systems. Additionally, it can support the modelling of the subsidence and incidentally the constraint of the hydrocarbon maturity of a given area. - A structural workflow used to quickly and accurately define major and secondary fault systems. The integration of the 3 D structural interpretation results ensures the analysis of the fault networks kinematics which can affect hydrocarbon trapping mechanisms. The application of these integrated workflows brings new insight into two complex settings on the Australian North West Shelf and ensures the definition of astonishing stratigraphic and structural outcomes. The stratigraphic workflow ensures the 3 D characterization of the Late Palaeozoic glacial depositional system on the Mermaid Nose (Dampier Subbasin, Northern Carnarvon Basin) that presents similarities with the glacial facies along the Neotethys margin up to Oman (chapter 3. 1). A subsidence model reveals the Phanerozoic geodynamic evolution of this area (chapter 3. 2) and emphasizes two distinct mode of regional extension for the Palaeozoic (Neotethys opening) and Mesozoic (abyssal plains opening). The structural workflow is used for the definition of the structural evolution of the Laminaria High area (Bonaparte Basin). Following a regional structural characterization of the Timor Sea (chapter 4. 1), a thorough analysis of the Mesozoic fault architecture reveals a local rotation of the stress field and the development of reverse structures (flower structures) in extensional setting, that form potential hydrocarbon traps (chapter 4. 2). The definition of the complex Neogene structural architecture associated with the fault kinematic analysis and a plate flexure model (chapter 4. 3) suggest that the Miocene to Pleistocene reactivation phases recorded at the Laminaria High most probably result from the oblique normal reactivation of the underlying Mesozoic fault planes. This episode is associated with the deformation of the subducting Australian plate. Based on these results three papers were published in international journals and two additional publications will be submitted. Additionally this research led to several communications in international conferences. Although the different workflows presented in this research have been primarily developed and used for the analysis of specific stratigraphic and structural geobodies on the Australian North West Shelf, similar integrated 3 D seismic approaches will have applications to hydrocarbon exploration and production phases; for instance increasing the recognition of potential source rocks, secondary migration pathways, additional traps or reservoir breaching mechanisms. The new elements brought by this research further highlight that 3 D seismic data contains a tremendous amount of hidden geological information waiting to be revealed and that will undoubtedly bring new insight into depositional systems, structural evolution and geohistory of the areas reputed being explored and constrained and other yet to be constrained. The further development of 3 D texture attributes highlighting specific features of the seismic signal, the integration of quantitative analysis for stratigraphic and structural processes, the automation of the interpretation workflow as well as the formal definition of "seismo-morphologic" characteristics {{of a wide range of}} geobodies from various environments would represent challenging examples of continuation of this present research. The 21 st century will most probably represent a transition period between fossil and other alternative energies. The next generation of <b>seismic</b> interpreters <b>prospecting</b> for hydrocarbon will undoubtedly face new challenges mostly due to the shortage of obvious and easy targets. They will probably have to keep on integrating techniques and geological processes in order to further capitalise the seismic data for new potentials definition. Imagination and creativity will most certainly be among the most important quality required from such geoscientists...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{management}} of marine environments {{requires an understanding}} of how natural communities are affected by anthropogenic perturbations. A potentially severe stress to these environments is the <b>seismic</b> <b>prospecting</b> of hydrocarbon deposits (Gausland, 2003). This method is based on the production of high intensity sound pulses, which are reflected by the ocean floor and recorded using very sensitive hydrophones. After being processed, these signals are used by researchers to generate a wealth of information about the topography of the ocean floor and its underlying geological formations. Given that the use of air guns is currently the most important method of <b>seismic</b> <b>prospecting</b> (Wardle et al., 2001; Gausland, 2003), several studies have investigated the environmental impact of the use of air guns, particularly on shrimp fisheries (Andriguetto-Filho et al., 2005), marine turtles (McCauley et al., 2000), and mammals (Richardson et al., 1986; Au et al., 1997...|$|E
