40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> at bridge abutments in the seismic behavior of “ordinary” bridges. The seismic responses of bridges subjected to spatially uniform and spatially varying ground motions for three shear-key conditions—nonlinear <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> that break off and cease to provide transverse restraint if deformed beyond a certain limit; elastic <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> that do not break off and continue to provide transverse restraint throughout the ground shaking; and no shear keys—are examined. Results show that seismic demands for a bridge with nonlinear <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> can generally be bounded by {{the demands of a}} bridge with elastic <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> and a bridge with no <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> for both types of ground motions. While ignoring <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> provides conservative estimates of seismic demands in bridges subjected to spatially uniform ground motion, such a practice may lead to underestimation of some seismic demands in bridges in fault-rupture zones that are subjected to spatially varying ground motion.

For M yy, a similar trend between the two cases was observed. Similar response values were obtained suggesting that <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> are not effective in reducing the moment about y-y axis. For M zz [...] (Figure 15), the presence or failure of <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> is expected to affect the bridge response. The response of bridges with <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> increases with skew, while the response of those without <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> decreases with skew showing larger response. This observation confirms that the effectiveness of <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> reduces as skew angles increases.

40|$|Multi-beam bridges {{made from}} precast {{concrete}} box girders {{are one of}} the most common bridge types used in the United States. One problem that affects these bridges is the development of longitudinal or reflective cracks on the road surface because of failure of the shear keys. Some states have attempted to correct this problem by redesigning the <b>shear</b> <b>key</b> or adding post-tensioning, but the problem persists in many new bridges. The purpose of this study is to investigate why these <b>shear</b> <b>key</b> failures are occurring. This project studies two types of box girder designs, the common Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI) box girder bridges and the Texas Department of Tranportation (TxDOT) box girder bridge. In the past, reflective cracking has occurred in bridges of both types. The analysis procedure involves finite element analyses of bridge models with realistic support and loading conditions, and comparing the PCI and TxDOT bridges. The results indicate that both PCI and TxDOT box girder have sufficient strength to resist cracking from vehicular loads, but uneven temperature changes and shrinkage strains cause high tensile stresses in the <b>shear</b> <b>key</b> regions and lead to reflective cracking. The analyses showed the highest stresses were often times near the supports, rather than at midspan. Past studies have proposed using larger composite deck slabs, transverse posttensioning, or full-depth shear keys to prevent <b>shear</b> <b>key</b> failure. Composite slabs were the most effective way to reduce high stresses in shear keys, and were effective for all loading cases considered.

In recent years, foam cores have increasingly been used in composite sandwich constructions due to their ease of manufacture and low cost. However, their performances are often limited by their vulnerability to skin-core debonding. The shear-key methodology proposed in this thesis is a simple and cost-effective way of improving the shear resistance of foam-core composite panels and reducing the probability of their failure at the skin-core interface. This research is aimed at investigating improvements {{that can be achieved}} using <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> and the influence of geometric parameters on the shear resistance of foam-core sandwich panels. The panels employed have glass fibre-reinforced polymer skins and polyvinylchloride and polyurethane foam-core materials while the <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> are made from chopped strand glass fibres impregnated with epoxy resin. The effect of a <b>shear</b> <b>key’s</b> diameter, pitch and orientation in a sandwich panel subjected to shear loading is first investigated numerically using finite element modelling.

This thesis specifically studies the effects of block type and the use of grouted <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> at the block head joints. Three full-scale walls were constructed and tested under in-plane, cyclic loading. To compare the effect of block type on shear strength, one wall was constructed from Rhino blocks as used by the Center for Vocational Building Technology, while another used V-Lock blocks designed by the Vermeer Corporation. Apart from differences in size and interlock mechanism, the standard Rhino blocks have <b>shear</b> <b>keys</b> at the head joints which are not present on the V-Lock blocks.
