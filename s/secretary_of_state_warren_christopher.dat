The war was originally fought between the Croatian Defence Council and Croatian volunteer troops {{on one side and}} the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) on the other, but by 1994, the Croatian Army had an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 troops involved in the fighting. Under pressure from the United States, the belligerents agreed on a truce in late February, followed by a meeting of Croatian, Bosnian, and Bosnian Croat representatives with US <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Christopher</b> in Washington, D.C. on February 26, 1994. On March 4, Franjo Tuđman endorsed the agreement providing for the creation of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and an alliance between Bosnian and Croatian armies against the Serb forces.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{official}} police and security sector discussions, the U.S. was undertaking some independent training and equipment donations, though the programs—mainly organized by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)—were not explicitly detailed to the international community. Lia writes that covert contacts and counter-terrorism collaboration between the PLO and the CIA had been ongoing in the 1970s and throughout the Lebanese Civil War in the 1980s but were not favored in the Reagan and Bush administrations. After the Oslo accords, the Clinton Administration revived covert ties and intelligence training. In January 1994 media sources reported that PLO officials and bodyguards were traveling to the U.S. to receive training {{as a result of}} an agreement between Arafat and U.S. <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Warren</b> <b>Christopher.</b> Publicly, the U.S. was ambivalent regarding support for police and security sector activities. The Gaza–Jericho Agreement between the PLO and Israel signed on May 4, 1994 increased U.S. interest in coordinating public international efforts to fund the PLO police who were to deploy into Gaza and Jericho. The day after the treaty was signed, the U.S. announced a $5 million grant for the PLO police and they worked to encourage other nations to donate flexible funds for the same purpose.|$|E

50|$|A genuine {{crisis in}} transatlantic {{relations}} blew up over Bosnia. London and Paris resisted relaxation of the UN arms embargo, and discouraged US escalation, arguing that arming the Muslims or bombing the Serbs could worsen the bloodshed and endanger their peacekeepers on the ground. US <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Warren</b> Christopher's campaign {{to lift the}} embargo was rebuffed by Major and President Mitterrand in May 1993. After the so-called 'Copenhagen ambush' in June 1993, where Clinton 'ganged up' with Chancellor Kohl to rally the European Community against the peacekeeping states, Major {{was said to be}} contemplating the death of the special relationship. The following month the United States voted at the UN with non-aligned countries against Britain and France over lifting the embargo.|$|R

2500|$|The {{closeness}} of the election was clear and both the Bush and Gore campaigns organized themselves for the ensuing legal process. [...] The Bush campaign hired George H. W.

50|$|In January 1993, Clinton {{appointed}} W. Anthony Lake as his National Security Adviser. Lake, {{a former}} Foreign Service officer, served under Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's National Security Adviser, and {{as director of}} the Department <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Policy Planning Staff during the Carter administration. During the Carter years, Lake had witnessed the negative effects of bureaucratic infighting and squabbling between then <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Cyrus Vance and National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. As Clinton's National Security Adviser, Lake was effective in maintaining cordial relations with <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Warren</b> M. Christopher and in developing an atmosphere of cooperation and collegiality. Lake initially maintained a low public profile, avoiding public appearances and television interviews, so as not to upstage the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> as Kissinger had done in the Nixon administration. In September 1993, however, in response to criticism that the Clinton administration had not adequately explained its foreign policy, Lake began to appear as a public speaker.|$|R

50|$|Under that treaty (which {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the Unification Treaty that was signed only between the two German states), the last Allied forces still present in Germany left in 1994, in accordance with article 4 of the treaty, that set 31 December 1994 as the deadline for the withdrawal of the remaining Allied forces. The bulk of Russian ground forces left Germany on 25 June 1994 with a military parade of the 6th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade in Berlin. The withdrawal of the last Russian troops (the Russian Army's Western Group of Forces) was completed on 31 August 1994, and the event was marked by a military ceremony in the Treptow Park in Berlin, with the presence of Russian President Yeltsin and German Chancellor Kohl. Although the bulk of the British, American, and French Forces had left Germany even before the departure of the Russians, the ceremony marking the withdrawal of the remaining Forces of the Western Allies was the last to take place: on 8 September 1994, a Farewell Ceremony in the courtyard of the Charlottenburg Palace, with the presence of British Prime Minister John Major, American <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Warren</b> Cristopher, French President François Mitterrand, and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, marked the withdrawal of the British, American and French Occupation Forces from Berlin, and the termination of the Allied occupation in Germany. Thus, the removal of the Allied presence took place a few months before the final deadline.|$|R
