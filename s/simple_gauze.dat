40|$|Abstract In recent years, textile based wound {{dressing}} products have grown from <b>simple</b> <b>gauze</b> to smart dressings with considerable technical and commercial impact. Today, {{wound dressing}}s are manufactured {{from a large}} variety of different materials and applied in all phases of wound healing. In this study, commercially available wound dressing products were investigated and compared in vitro. The dressings tested and evaluated vary in their components and structures and basically fell into three main groups: nonwoven, foam and hydroactive dressing products. This study tested and analysed the properties of 13 different commercial dressings: 5 nonwoven, 5 foam and 3 hydroactive dressings. Standard test methods were employed during the study {{in order to determine}} the fluid handling capability, dehydration rate, vertical wicking, absorption behaviour and pH values of the dressings. These characteristics have profound effect on the performance of the dressings as wound care biomedical materials. It was found that the nonwoven fibrous dressings have better absorbency characteristics than foam and hydroactive dressings and the nonwoven dressings also had lower pH value compared to the foam and hydroactive dressings...|$|E

States that flu {{likely to remain}} in Birmingham throughout winter, based on research of health authorities in other cities nationwide. • Dr. N. A. Barrett, City Commissioner and retired doctor: “I have never yet seen an epidemic subside all at once and the influenza {{will not be an}} exception to this rule. ”• City businesses have agreed to have their clerks wear gauze masks. Pastors Union will ask their congregations to wear masks to church services. • Drug stores will make masks available at a reasonable price. Red Cross will assist in effort. • 128 new cases reported and 18 bp’s issued on Thursday• “Very few” children reported sick with flu. • Dr. Dowling’s official statement presented in full. Opens: “We are convinced that the wearing of a <b>simple</b> <b>gauze</b> face mask is the most practical and efficient general method at our command to limit the spread of influenza. ” Statement describes the masks, indicating that they are comfortable, provide protection to the wearer and ensure that wearer will not be cause of spread of flu to others. Recommends that masks be changed every several hours, but notes that used/dirty masks are better than no masks. Encourages those sewing for Red Cross make masks and offer them for sale at cost of material. Newspaper article...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Postamputation {{management}} {{is an important}} deter-minant of recovery from amputation. However, consensus on the most effective postoperative management strategies for indi-viduals undergoing transtibial amputation (TTA) is lacking. Dressings can include <b>simple</b> soft <b>gauze</b> dressings, thigh-high rigid cast dressings, shorter removable rigid dressings, and pre-fabricated pneumatic dressings. Postoperative prosthetic attach-ments {{can be added to}} all but simple soft dressings. These dressings address the need to cleanly cover a fresh surgical wound, but not all postoperative dressings are designed to facili-tate the strategic goals of preventing knee contractures, reducing edema, protecting from external trauma, or facilitating early weight bearing. The type of dressing and management strategy often overlap and are certainly interrelated. Current protocols and decisions are based on local practice, skill, and intuition...|$|R
40|$|In major burns, local {{treatment}} of the split skin graft after a burn injury is important to prevent serious infectious complications. Topical burn wound therapy may improve the bacteriological condition of the wound, which in turn may improve the successful take of a skin graft. Delay of wound healing is an undesired side effect of these topical anti-microbial agents. It is known that povidone-iodine has many clinical advantages. In view of this, the total healing time of the freshly grafted burn wound was studied. In this prospective study, comparable areas of the same patient were treated with povidone-iodine ointment or with <b>simple</b> vaseline <b>gauze.</b> There was no statistical difference in the total wound healing time between the treated and the control group. status: publishe...|$|R

Public Health Service, in its entirety• “The disease now occurring {{in this country and}} called “Spanish Influenza” resembles a very contagious kind of “cold” accompanied by fever, pains in the head, eyes, ears, back, or {{other parts of the body}} and a feeling of severe sickness. ”• “In most of the cases the symptoms disappear after three or four days, the patient then rapidly recovering some of the patients, however, develop pneumonia or inflammation of the ear, or meningitis, and many of these complicated cases die. ”• “Whether this so-called “Spanish” influenza is identical with the influenza of earlier years is not yet known. ”• “Epidemics of influenza have visited this country since 1647. It is interesting to know that this first epidemic was brought here from Valencia, Spain. ”• “Although the present influenza is called “Spanish influenza” there is no reason to believe that it originated in Spain. ”• “No matter what particular kind of germ causes the epidemic, it is now believed that influenza is always spread from person to person, the germ being carried with the air along with very small droplets of mucus, expelled by coughing or sneezing, forceful talking, and the like by one who already has the germs of the disease. ”• “It is very important that every person who becomes sick with influenza should go home at once and go to bed. ”• “Nurses and attendants will do well to guard against breathing in dangerous disease germs by wearing a <b>simple</b> fold of <b>gauze</b> or mask while near the patient. ”• “So far as influenza is concerned health authorities everywhere recognize the very close relation between its spread and overcrowded homes. ”• “The value of fresh air through open windows can not be overemphasized. ”• “Cover up each cough and sneeze, If you don't you'll spread disease. ”Newspaper articl...|$|R
