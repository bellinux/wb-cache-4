25|$|Before 1898, {{devotion to}} the Holy Face of Jesus used an image based on the Veil of Veronica, where legend recounts that Veronica from Jerusalem {{encountered}} Jesus along the Via Dolorosa {{on the way to}} Calvary. When <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> wipe the sweat from Jesus's face with her veil, the image was imprinted on the cloth. The establishment of these images as Catholic devotions traces back to Sister Marie of St Peter and the Venerable Leo Dupont who started and promoted them from 1844 to 1874 in Tours France, and Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli who associated the image from the Shroud of Turin with the devotion in 1936 in Milan Italy.|$|E
500|$|Harding went to {{bed early}} in the evening of July 27, 1923. Later that night, he called for his physician, Charles E. Sawyer, {{complaining}} of pain in the upper abdomen. Sawyer thought it was a recurrence of a dietary upset, but Dr. Joel T. Boone suspected a heart problem. The next day, as the train rushed to San Francisco, Harding felt better, and when they arrived on the morning of July 29, 1923, he insisted on walking from the train to the car, which rushed him to the Palace Hotel where he suffered a relapse. Doctors found that not only was Harding's heart causing problems, but he also had pneumonia, a serious matter in the days before effective antibiotics. When treated with caffeine and digitalis, Harding seemed to improve. He was pleased when his planned foreign policy address advocating membership in the World Court was released to the press by Hoover and received a favorable reception. By the afternoon of August 2, 1923, doctors allowed Harding to sit up in bed. That evening, about 7:30 pm, he was listening to his wife read him a flattering article about him from The Saturday Evening Post, [...] "A Calm Review of a Calm Man". When <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> plump his pillows, he said, [...] "That's good, read some more". As Florence Harding resumed, her husband twisted convulsively and collapsed, and she raced to get the doctors. They attempted stimulants, but were unable to revive him, and President Harding {{died of a heart attack}} on August 2, 1923, at the age of 57. His death was initially attributed to a cerebral hemorrhage, as doctors at the time did not generally understand the symptoms of a heart attack.|$|E

25|$|When Miss Gilchrist {{is arrested}} and taken away, <b>she</b> <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> repeat her {{imitation}} of Cora. Poirot hints she {{likely will be}} committed for insanity. There is no further discussion.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> unable <b>to</b> {{bring out}} the word which should have come next.|$|R

6000|$|Another {{minute and}} I was {{automatically}} {{opening the door}} for her. As she passed <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> do something to her dress and whispered, ...|$|E

60|$|Anne bowed, {{and left}} him. Arrived at the short flight of steps which {{led up to}} the door, <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> collect her {{thoughts}} before she went in.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> {{appearing}} <b>to</b> seek for something. Failing {{to find it}} {{she looked}} up at him again, between scorn and intercession.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bathos attends {{all high}} words," [...] he said, as <b>she</b> <b>paused,</b> chiefly <b>to</b> see {{whether he was}} awake, and not like her dumb playfellow of old.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> {{and seemed}} <b>to</b> be {{referring}} {{the point to}} Staniford.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dick," [...] she {{interrupted}} him, {{leaning toward}} him and searching him. <b>She</b> <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> frame her thought, {{and then went on}} with directness. [...] "In our dozen years, will you say it has never been any more with you?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{instead of}} this <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> hear Mrs. Rowe declare {{he was a}} bad 'un, with a nasty sulky temper {{that no one could}} do nothing with, and just then she saw Florence Cray {{crossing}} the village green.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should not}} be rude, and interrupt," [...] said Jessie; whereupon Susan pouted, the two idlest began to play with each other's fingers, and, as soon as <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> take breath, Lily Bell jumped up, and brought her the book open.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> {{and seemed}} <b>to</b> reflect, still {{outwardly}} as calm as ever.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> ashamed <b>to</b> {{express the}} doubt she felt how far her father dared to form any {{positive}} resolution on this most important subject {{without the consent}} of his lady.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused.</b> I {{wondered}} <b>to</b> myself {{why that}} young revolutionist should show so little alacrity.|$|R
60|$|Bang, bang, {{went the}} little hatchet, and down came one brick after another, till {{the hole was}} large enough for Fay to thrust her head through; and being breathless by that time, <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> rest {{and take a look}} at Johnny's court.|$|E
60|$|At {{first she}} strolled {{slowly through the}} streets, but presently, {{increasing}} her pace, resolved to take the lad for a country walk. At Tranquil Vale <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> tie up her boot-lace, and, satisfying herself that Bassett was still in pursuit, set off again.|$|E
60|$|Swiftly her lithe form darted {{through the}} forest paths until she reached the edge of mighty Burzee, when <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> gaze curiously about her. Never until now had she ventured so far, for the Law of the Forest had placed the nymphs in its inmost depths.|$|E
50|$|Act I, Tableau 2. -- a spooky forest. Woodcutters can {{be heard}} {{chopping}} wood. Riding Hood comes out of some bushes.

When he challenges her to see who will get there first, she agrees, and both of them run off in different directions as the woodcutters resume their work.|$|R
60|$|I made no reply, {{although}} <b>she</b> evidently <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> give me {{an opportunity}} to speak. I could not have uttered a syllable to have saved my life. The pause was impressive, rather than long.|$|R
6000|$|Torfrida was on {{the point}} of saying, [...] "He has won it; let him wear it for my sake." [...] But <b>she</b> <b>paused.</b> <b>She</b> longed <b>to</b> see Hereward face to face; to speak to him, if but one word.

60|$|Telford's eyes {{followed}} her with pitiful absorption. He saw her lead a horse from the stable and harness {{it into a}} wood-sleigh loaded with bags of grain.

60|$|The reply of Mrs Wyllys was not audible to {{the covert}} listeners.

6000|$|... "I want to know!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "The durned fool! Well, Appleton Brice didn't {{have the}} family brains, ands {{he was kind}} of soft-hearted.

6000|$|... "Ah, {{for things}} I mayn't want to know, I promise you shall find me stupid." [...] They had reached their door, where <b>she</b> herself <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> explain. [...] "These days, yesterday, last night, this morning, I've wanted everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet {{you will}} do nothing to relieve him? You will refuse this money, though it is your own, when you could be married to Mr Owen to-morrow?" [...] Then <b>she</b> <b>paused,</b> waiting <b>to</b> find {{what might be the}} effect of her eloquence.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> {{long enough}} <b>to</b> let her words take effect in Harry's sentimental quarters, but not {{long enough to}} allow him a reply.|$|R
60|$|Her {{eyes filled}} with tears. <b>She</b> <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> control herself. We both begged her to say no more. Her husband, joining us, added his entreaties to ours.

6000|$|... "I am lonely," [...] she faltered out at last--"horribly lonely; and I {{know now}} how people feel toward my mother, {{and it hurts}} me--it all hurts me; but I'm going to stay and help her--" [...] <b>She</b> <b>paused</b> <b>to</b> recover her voice.

6000|$|Unnoticed {{she passed}} through the village street and crept up the stairs {{at the end of}} the store building. Before the door marked [...] "H.

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> came round <b>to</b> where I was sitting, perched {{herself on}} the end of the table, and, resting her hands on my shoulders, added gently: ...|$|R
60|$|They {{were leaving}} the churchyard now. <b>She</b> <b>paused</b> abruptly, {{pointing}} <b>to</b> a single grave {{in a part of}} the churchyard which seemed detached from the rest.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> {{long enough}} <b>to</b> {{give a little}} sob which she could not repress. Margaret made use of the {{opportunity}} to exclaim violently, [...] "It's a shame!" ...|$|R
