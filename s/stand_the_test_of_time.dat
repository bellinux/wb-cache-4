[...] Writing for the foundation, Jim O'Neal noted that [...] "regardless of mythology and rock 'n' roll renditions, Johnson's record was indeed a powerful one, a song that would <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> on its own". [...] In 1998, it received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award to acknowledge its quality and place in recording history. In 1995, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed Cream's [...] "Crossroads" [...] as one of the [...] "500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll".

500|$|Initial {{reactions}} among {{film critics}} were mixed. Some {{wrote that the}} plot took {{a back seat to}} the film's special effects, and did not fit the studio's marketing as an action/adventure movie. Others acclaimed its complexity and predicted it would <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Negative criticism in the United States cited its slow pace. Sheila Benson from the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "Blade Crawler", and Pat Berman in The State and Columbia Record described it as [...] "science fiction pornography". Pauline Kael praised Blade Runner as worthy of a place in film history for its distinctive sci-fi vision, yet criticized the film's lack of development in [...] "human terms".|$|E
500|$|Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine was {{impressed}} with the album and said that [...] "Madonna, with the help of Price, [...] has succeeded at creating a dance-pop odyssey with an emotional, if not necessarily narrative, arc — and one big continuously-mixed F you to the art-dismantling iPod Shuffle in the process." [...] He compared the album to Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue's studio album X (2007), saying [...] "Comparisons to X, Kylie Minogue's own discofied comeback album from 2007, are inevitable". Alan Light from Rolling Stone declared that the album illustrated that [...] "Madonna has never lost her faith {{in the power of the}} beat." [...] However, he opined that [...] "Confessions on a Dance Floor won't <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> like her glorious early club hits, but it proves its point.

Tuck stated {{that there were}} four or five songs that were finished and that [...] "usually we write and record 14 tracks that I then have to write vocal lines for, but this time I’m trying to write the vocals as I write the music." [...] Bullet for My Valentine confirmed in August 2009 that they were aiming for an early 2010 release for the new album, while Tuck stated that the upcoming record is [...] "a lot more mature-sounding, it's a lot more classic. It'll <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> [...] than both the previous things we've done." [...] In a January 2010 interview with Rock Sound, Tuck stated explained details for the album: it would be titled Fever, and the 11-track record would have a sound closer to The Poison rather than Scream Aim Fire and contain no ballads.|$|E
500|$|To {{follow-up}} It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, {{the group}} pursued a different direction, content-wise. According to Chuck D, {{they sought to}} make a more thematically focused work and to condense Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's theory of [...] "Color Confrontation and Racism (White Supremacy)" [...] into an album-length recording, [...] "telling people, well, color's an issue created and concocted {{to take advantage of}} people of various characteristics with the benefit of a few". He recalled their concept for the album in an interview with Billboard, [...] "We wanted really to go with a deep, complex album ... more conducive to the high and lows of great stage-performance". Chuck D also cited in their creative vision the commercial circumstances for hip hop at the time, having quickly transitioned from a singles to an album medium in the music industry during the 1980s. In an interview for Westword, he later said, [...] "We understood the magnitude of what an album was, so we set out to make something that not only epitomized the standard of an album, but would <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> by being diverse with sounds and textures, and also being able to home in on the aspect of peaks and valleys".|$|E
500|$|Absolute Garbage {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinqumani gave a positive {{overview of the}} compilation, writing that the album [...] "serves as an anthropological study of the musical relics of a bygone era", while Laila Hassani of Heat summed up her five-star review by writing, [...] "Few modern female-fronted rock bands <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> but this reminds you why, along with Gwen Stefani's No Doubt, Garbage are one of them." [...] A reviewer for Instinct wrote [...] "this hits collection is loaded with songs best described as massive... you'll find something to love here". Jaime Gill, in a review for BBC Music, felt that [...] "Absolute Garbage is a fine legacy, {{the sound of a}} briefly brilliant and always interesting band" [...] and that overall the album [...] "sounds like no other greatest hits you own." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine wrote, [...] "By wrapping their nut-grabbing hooks and transcendent melodies in layers of gutsy guitars, Garbage managed to make pop music for people who thought they didn't like pop music. For that reason, whatever happens next, they deserve to be remembered fondly." [...] A reviewer for the Daily Mail described it as [...] "a slick blend of grunge-rock power and sultry girl-group harmonies" [...] and added, [...] " [...] already sounds dated, but the songs stand up well." ...|$|E

500|$|Like the {{original}} release, The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition received positive reviews from critics. Sean Ely of GamePro praised its updated audio, {{and said that}} the new graphics [...] "blow the old clunker visuals ... out of the water". He cited its script, humor, plot, puzzles and balanced difficulty level as high points, and finished, [...] "The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is impressive, hilarious and downright worth your money." [...] Daemon Hatfield of IGN wrote, [...] "Almost 20 years after its release, [...] remains a blast to play." [...] He called the new graphics [...] "slick, if a little generic", and noted that the [...] "original graphics have a certain charm to them that the fancy pants new visuals just don't." [...] However, he enjoyed the redone music, the new hint function, and the added sound effects and voice acting. He summarized it as [...] "one of the best times you'll ever have pointing and clicking", and noted that [...] "few games are this funny." [...] Justin Calvert of GameSpot noted that [...] "the Special Edition looks much better and {{is the only way to}} play if you want to hear ... what characters are saying, whereas {{the original}} game's interface is less clunky." [...] However, he wrote that [...] "the voice work is such a great addition to the game that it's difficult to go back to the original edition." [...] He praised its humor, writing, puzzles and characters, and he believed that it had aged well. Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead wrote, [...] "Purists like me will almost certainly find something to grumble about over the span of the game, but the overall impact of the redesign is undeniably for the better." [...] However, he preferred the original game's Guybrush design, and believed that the new control system was [...] "rather less intuitive" [...] than the old one. He finished by stating that [...] "few games can <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> with such confidence".|$|E

2500|$|Chicago {{literature}} {{finds its}} roots in the city's tradition of lucid, direct journalism, lending to a strong tradition of social realism. In the Encyclopedia of Chicago, Northwestern University Professor Bill Savage describes Chicago fiction as prose which tries to [...] "capture the essence of the city, its spaces and its people". The challenge for early writers was that Chicago was a frontier outpost that transformed into a global metropolis in the span of two generations. Narrative fiction of that time, much of it in the style of [...] "high-flown romance" [...] and [...] "genteel realism", needed a new approach to describe the urban social, political, and economic conditions of Chicago. Nonetheless, Chicagoans worked hard to create a literary tradition that would <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> and create a [...] "city of feeling" [...] out of concrete, steel, vast lake, and open prairie. Much notable Chicago fiction focuses on the city itself, with social criticism keeping exultation in check.|$|E
2500|$|Etheredge-Ouzts {{had never}} been able to devise an {{appropriate}} title for the film by the end of 2002. The producers proposed holding an online contest to allow the public to name the film (sight unseen). The contest began running in September 2003. Etheredge-Ouzts was dismayed to discover that most of the suggestions were very poor; many were sexually inappropriate, some far too campy, and others too topical (which meant they would not <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time).</b> Among the suggestions received were Boy Meets Knife, Queer Eye for the Dead Guy, and 28 Gays Later. Among the final eight submissions received on the final day of the contest was the title Hellbent. [...] Etheredge-Ouzts chose Hellbent for the title because it was aggressive and simple, as well as a play on words (referring both to the devil-masked killer and the [...] "bent" [...] victims). The title was also flexible, in that it could refer to the killer, the victims' recklessness, or the fast pacing of the picture.|$|E

In 2015, they also named it the best Nintendo console of all time, saying, [...] "The list of games we love from this console completely annihilates any other roster from the Big N."

2500|$|Manet and Baudelaire became {{constant}} companions {{from around}} 1855. In the early 1860s, Baudelaire accompanied Manet on daily sketching trips and often met him socially. Manet also lent Baudelaire money and looked after his affairs, particularly when Baudelaire went to Belgium. Baudelaire encouraged Manet {{to strike out}} on his own path and not succumb to criticism. [...] "Manet has great talent, a talent which will <b>stand</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> But he has a weak character. He seems to me crushed and stunned by shock." [...] In his painting Music in the Tuileries, Manet includes portraits of his friends Théophile Gautier, Jacques Offenbach, and Baudelaire. While it's difficult to differentiate who influenced whom, both Manet and Baudelaire discussed and expressed some common themes through their respective arts. Baudelaire praised the modernity of Manet's subject matter: [...] "almost all our originality comes from the stamp that 'time' imprints upon our feelings." [...] When Manet's famous Olympia (1863), a portrait of a nude prostitute, provoked a scandal for its blatant realism mixed with an imitation of Renaissance motifs, Baudelaire worked privately to support his friend, though he offered no public defense (he was, however, ill at the time). When Baudelaire returned from Belgium after his stroke, Manet and his wife were frequent visitors at the nursing home and she would play passages from Wagner for Baudelaire on the piano.|$|E
2500|$|Frege's first work, the Begriffsschrift ("concept script") is a rigorously axiomatised {{system of}} propositional logic, relying on just two connectives (negational and conditional), two rules of {{inference}} (modus ponens and substitution), and six axioms.

[...] The most significant innovation, however, was his explanation of the quantifier in terms of mathematical functions. [...] Traditional logic regards the sentence [...] "Caesar is a man" [...] as of fundamentally the same form as [...] "all men are mortal." [...] Sentences with a proper name subject were regarded as universal in character, interpretable as [...] "every Caesar is a man".
