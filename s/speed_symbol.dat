This 6 -year longitudinal cohort study of 1, 903 midlife US women (2000 – 2006) asked whether symptoms negatively affect cognitive performance during the menopause transition and whether {{they are responsible for}} the negative effect of perimenopause on cognitive processing speed. Major exposures were depressive, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms and menopause transition stages. Outcomes were longitudinal performance in 3 domains: processing <b>speed</b> (<b>Symbol</b> Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)), verbal memory (East Boston Memory Test), and working memory (Digit Span Backward). Adjustment for demographics showed that women with concurrent depressive symptoms scored 1 point lower on the SDMT (P < 0. 05). On the East Boston Memory Test, the rate of learning among women with anxiety symptoms tested previously was 0. 09 smaller per occasion (P = 0. 03), 53 % of the mean learning rate. The SDMT learning rate was 1. 00 point smaller during late perimenopause than during premenopause (P = 0. 04); further adjustment for symptoms did not attenuate this negative effect. Depressive and anxiety symptoms had a small, negative effect on processing speed. The authors found that depressive, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms did not account for the transient decrement in SDMT learning observed during late perimenopause...|$|E

We analyzed data from 5, 144 men and women between 20 and 59 years {{of age in the}} Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 – 94) with mortality follow-up evaluation through 2006. Cognitive function tests, including assessments of executive function/processing <b>speed</b> (<b>symbol</b> digit substitution) and learning recall/short-term memory (serial digit learning), were performed. All-cause mortality was the outcome of interest. After adjusting for multiple variables, total mortality was significantly higher in males with poorer executive function/processing speed (hazard ratio (HR) 2. 02; 95 % confidence interval 1. 36 to 2. 99) and poorer recall/short-term memory (HR 1. 47; 95 % confidence interval 1. 02 to 2. 12). After adjusting for multiple variables, the mortality risk did not significantly increase among the females in these two cognitive tests groups. In this sample of the US population, poorer executive function/processing speed and poorer learning recall/short-term memory were significantly associated with increased mortality rates, especially in males.

There {{is a need to}} develop standard speed hump warning signs as well as to determine speed hump markings that take into account both motorist comprehension and community preference. This study had two major goals. The first was to examine preference for various configurations for signs that are placed next to a speed hump as well as for lead signs when approaching a series of speed humps. The second was to examine which type of speed hump markings people prefer. There were 103 research participants in this study. In the first task, participants developed speed hump signs that included <b>speed</b> hump <b>symbols,</b> <b>speed</b> advisory messages, and location indication messages. In the second task, participants compared ten different speed hump markings and determined which markings they: (1) liked the most, (2) thought made it easiest to actually detect a hump, (3) thought made it most difficult to do so, and (4) thought best indicated a raised pedestrian crosswalk. The paper discusses the various speed hump sign configurations and roadway markings that participants preferred or thought would most effectively warn drivers. The results of this study will be used in future research to objectively evaluate comprehension, conspicuity, and driver behavior for different speed hump sign and marking designs...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{cognitive}} impairment in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) survivors {{with the main}} aim to evaluate possible effects by targeted temperature management. Secondary aims are to describe the prevalence of cognitive impairment in {{a large group of}} OHCA-survivors, the related symptoms of psychological distress and the actual effect of cognitive impairment for the patient’s ability to participate in everyday life and in the society (as work). Methods: In an international trial, OHCA-patients, unconscious after resuscitation, were randomized to 33 °C or 36 °C controlled temperature. Survivors were invited to a face-to-face follow-up 180 days post-arrest that included screening of cognitive impairment (MiniMental Status Examination), questionnaires of cognitive performance in everyday life (Two Simple Questions, Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline) and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) (Short Form Questionniare- 36 version 2 ®). An extended follow-up was performed at 20 sites in five countries and included assessments of memory (Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test), executive functions (Frontal Assessment Battery), attention/processing <b>speed</b> (<b>Symbol</b> Digit Modalities Test), psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and participation (Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory- 4). A matched control group of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients performed the same follow-up. Results: OHCA-survivors (n= 287) had overall good outcome and HRQoL, but half reported a decreased participation in everyday life and society. In addition, many informants (62 %) and patients (36 %) reported cognitive problems, and 27 % of survivors reported psychological distress. By objective assessments cognitive impairment was found in > 50 % of the survivors, and OHCA-survivors with cognitive impairment had an increased risk of being on sick leave. Cognitive impairment, depression, fatigue, and mobility restrictions were found important for participation in everyday life and in the society There were no differences in any of these outcomes between the two temperature groups (33 °C and 36 °C). Cognitive impairment and psychological distress was common also among STEMI-controls (n= 119), but OHCA-survivors had significantly more problems with attention/processing speed, return to work and participation compared to STEMI-controls. Conclusion. The two groups of TTM at 33 °C and 36 °C were similar also when brain injury is assessed in detail indicating no difference in outcome. Cognitive impairment was common in OHCA-survivors but STEMI-controls shared many of the symptoms and that impairment after OHCA needs to be seen in a greater context of risk factors including OHCA-related brain injury, cardiovascular co-morbidity, and critical illness related stressors. OHCAsurvivors had lower participation in everyday life compared to STEMI-controls. A structured follow-up to identify OHCA-survivors in risk for long-term consequences is recommended.

Brain Injury, 15 (7), 645 - 648. Mild {{traumatic brain injury}} (MTBI) in sports is a relatively common phenomenon, particularly where {{a high degree of}} physical contact is a central feature of the sport. While many of the MTBI's incurred by athletes may be innocuous, some result in negative outcomes that are more persistent and disabling. It is important, therefore, to ensure that sporting groups not only have adequate knowledge about the incidence and severity of MTBI and of the factors that typically surround its occurrence, but that they also have adequate guidelines regarding appropriate assessment, management and treatment of this phenomena. Despite numerous studies having been conducted with elite/professional or school grade players in high-contact sports such as American gridiron football and rugby league, very little research has been conducted in the area of club-grade rugby, and to-date, there has been no detailed examination of MTBI incurred at this level. The present investigation sought to rectify this situation. The proposed investigation, incorporating male rugby players participating in a regional club-grade competition, took place in two distinct phases. In {{the first phase of the}} research, three questionnaires were administered to players and to those monitoring the sport (i. e., coaches, team management, and referees). The results revealed a high rate of MTBI (14. 4 %), of which 20. 7 % of concussions involved a loss of consciousness (LOC). Identified risk factors included: (1) being under 21 years of age; (2) being a forward player, in particular a flanker; (3) the second half of a match; (4) frequent involvement in tackles; and (5) having a history of more than two MTBI. While a relatively high rate of mouthguard use was identified, it unfortunately did not reflect the compulsory use required by mandatory rugby laws. Attitudes relating to mouthguard use indicate that more education surrounding the proven benefits of mouthguard use in MTBI prevention is required at this level. Slightly more than half of the MTBI reported in the current investigation failed to receive any attention, with players involved at the top club-grade level (i. e., Senior I) more likely to have their injury go unrecognised than players in lower grades. Such findings are attributed in part to the subtlety of MTBI symptomology, but more importantly, to an apparent reluctance on the part of players to report these symptoms. While the majority of those monitoring club-grade players reported basic first aid training/qualifications, the need for more specific training in the assessment and management of MTBI is evident on the basis of the research findings. A general lack of knowledge regarding recommendations for periods of abstinence after MTBI (as advised by governing sporting bodies) was also demonstrated, highlighting another area requiring further attention. Phase II of the research involved the administration of three neuropsychological measures sensitive to deficits in information processing <b>speed</b> (<b>Symbol</b> Digit Modalities Test, Digit Symbol-Coding Test and Speed of Comprehension Test) in an attempt to monitor the rate of recovery after MTBI. However, on the basis of players reluctance to report (a phenomenon which appeared endemic at this level), the objectives in relation to this phase of the research were not achieved. The apparent failure of the latter research phase effectively highlights just one of a number of methodological problems associated with conducting research with this particular population, of which other difficulties also primarily relate to the collection of data (i. e., less-than-ideal testing conditions, missing data, etc.). On the basis of the research findings, continuing education and relevant training in relation to MTBI is advocated for all those involved at the club-grade level, particularly in relation to symptom recognition, potential adverse outcomes, protective factors and appropriate assessment and management techniques. Despite the challenges this area presents for research, continued exploration is recommended with careful consideration given to the methodological issues raised in the current investigation...|$|E

The encoder collects a set of symbols in a dictionary and encodes a page by reference to the dictionary symbols. JBIG 2 allows the encoder to view all symbols and choose a good set for the dictionary. We propose a two-pass technique for choosing the dictionary entries, and discuss the trade-offs in bit allocation that these choices entail. The proposed dictionary design technique outperforms simpler dictionary formation techniques by up to 7 - 9 % and 10 - 18 % for lossless and lossy compression, respectively. In the lossy case, we further point out one way to significantly <b>speed</b> up the <b>symbol</b> bitmap compression procedure. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} how age-related declines in vision (particularly contrast sensitivity), simulated using cataract-goggles and low-contrast stimuli, influence the accuracy {{and speed of}} cognitive test performance in older adults. An additional aim was to investigate whether declines in vision differentially affect secondary more than primary memory. Method: Using a fully within-subjects design, 50 older drivers aged 66 - 87 years completed two tests of cognitive performance - letter matching (perceptual <b>speed)</b> and <b>symbol</b> recall (short-term memory) - under different viewing conditions that degraded visual input (low-contrast stimuli, cataract-goggles, and low-contrast stimuli combined with cataract-goggles, compared with normal viewing). However, presentation time was also manipulated for letter matching. Visual function, as measured using standard charts, was {{taken into account in}} statistical analyses. Results: Accuracy and speed for cognitive tasks were significantly impaired when visual input was degraded. Furthermore, cognitive performance was positively associated with contrast sensitivity. Presentation time did not influence cognitive performance, and visual gradation did not differentially influence primary and secondary memory. Conclusion: Age-related declines in visual function can impact on the accuracy and speed of cognitive performance, and therefore the cognitive abilities of older adults may be underestimated in neuropsychological testing. It is thus critical that visual function be assessed prior to testing, and that stimuli be adapted to older adults' sensory capabilities (e. g., by maximising stimuli contrast) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Exposure {{to organic}} {{solvents}} is common among workers. Objective: To assess neurobehavioral effects of long-term exposure to organic solvents among rubber workers in Tehran, Iran. Methods: Across-sectional {{study was conducted}} on 223 employees of a rubber industry. The participants completed a data collection sheet on their occupational and medical history, and demographic characteristics including age, work experience, education level; they performed 6 psychiatric tests on the neurobehavioral core test battery (NCTB) that measure simple reaction time, short-term memory (digit span, Benton), eye-hand coordination (Purdue pegboard, pursuit aiming), and perceptual <b>speed</b> (digit <b>symbol).</b> Results: Workers exposed and not exposed to organic solvents had similar age and education distribution. The mean work experience of the exposed and non-exposed workers was 5. 9 and 4. 4 years, respectively. The exposed workers had a lower performance compared to non-exposed workers in all psychomotor tests. After controlling for the confounders by logistic regression analysis, {{it was found that}} exposure to organic solvents had a significant effect on the results of digit symbols, digit span, Benton, aiming, and simple reaction time tests. No significant effect was observed in pegboard test. Conclusion: Occupational exposure to organic solvent can induce subtle neurobehavioral changes among workers exposed to organic solvents; therefore, periodical evaluation of the central nervous system by objective psychomotor tests is recommended among those who are chronically exposed to organic solvents...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} the optimal elevation of tactile map symbols. Background: Tactile perception research predicts that symbol elevation (vertical height) and texture on tactile maps could influence their readability. However, while {{research has shown}} that elevation influences detection and discrimination thresholds for single tactile stimuli, and that the physiological response of fingertip receptors varies with texture, {{little is known about the}} influence of these parameters on the identification of stimuli in the context of multiple symbols as found on tactile maps. Method: Sighted and visually impaired participants performed tactile symbol identification tasks. In Experiment 1, we measured the effect of elevation on identification accuracy. In Experiment 2, we measured the effect of elevation and symbol texture on identification <b>speed.</b> Results: <b>Symbol</b> elevation influenced both speed and accuracy of identification with thresholds being higher than found in work on detection and discrimination but lower than on existing tactile maps. Further, as predicted from existing knowledge of tactile perception, rough features were identified more quickly than smooth ones. Finally, visually impaired participants performed better than sighted ones. Conclusion: The symbol elevations necessary for identification (0. 040 to 0. 080 mm) are considerably lower than would be expected on the basis of existing tactile maps (generally 0. 5 mm or higher) and design guidelines (0. 4 mm). Application: Tactile map production costs could be reduced and map durability increased by reducing symbol elevation. Further, legibility of maps could be improved by using rough features, which are read more easily, and smaller symbols, which reduces crowding of graphics...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between APOE genotype and cognitive function suggests a positive {{role for the}} e 2 allele and a negative role for the e 4 allele. Both alleles have relatively low frequencies in the general population; hence, meta-analyses {{have been based on}} many small, heterogeneous studies. Here, we report the APOE-cognition associations in the largest single analysis to date. APOE status and cognitive ability were measured in 18 [*] 337 participants from the Generation Scotland study between 2006 and 2011. The age range was 18 - 94 years with a mean of 47 (SD 15). Four cognitive domains were assessed: verbal declarative memory (paragraph recall), processing <b>speed</b> (digit <b>symbol</b> substitution), verbal fluency (phonemic verbal fluency), and vocabulary (Mill Hill synonyms). Linear regression was used to assess the associations between APOE genetic status and cognition. Possession of the e 4 allele was associated with lower scores on the measures of memory and processing speed in subjects aged > 60. Across all age ranges, the e 4 allele was linked to better verbal fluency scores. In younger subjects (≤ 60 years) the e 4 allele was linked to higher vocabulary scores. There were no associations between the e 2 allele and cognitive ability. As seen in previous meta-analyses, the APOE e 4 allele is linked to poorer cognitive performance in the domains of memory and processing speed. By contrast, positive associations were seen between the e 4 allele and measures of verbal fluency and vocabulary. All associations were relatively small and, in many cases, nominally significant despite the very large sample size...|$|R
