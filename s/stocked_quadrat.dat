40|$|Graduation date: 1952 There are {{approximately}} 4, 000, 000 acres of cut-over and burned-over land in western Washington and Oregon which are either non-stocked or unsatisfactorily stocked with young forest growth. This brings about {{a great need}} for a quick and efficient method of land examination from which to plan reforestation measures and make up management plans. This thesis is an explanation of one method, that of using aerial photographs in conjunction with limited ground observation. An example is given which illustrates that each $l. 00 saved in the planning stage of forest regeneration means $l 9. 23 more profit {{at the end of}} 100 years using an interest rate of 3 % compounded annually. More and more forest industries are beginning to use aerial photos for management plans, reforestation programs, and even cutting plans and preliminary road location. The first part of this thesis deals with the using of the aerial photographs and the recognition of the information found on them as substantiated by ground examination. The Blodgett tract is 2400 acres of logged and burned-over land in northwestern Oregon which was deeded to the Oregon State College School of Forestry for the purpose of establishing a reforestation study area. The photographs used were standard 9 x 9 inch contact prints of negative photographed with a f-l 2 " Aerial Mapping Camera by Delano Aerial Surveys of Portland, Oregon. The average scale of photography was 1 : 12, 000. The photographs were taken to the Blodgett tract and used as a guide in examining certain areas of the tract. Next a base map was made of the area using a slotted template laydown for horizontal control. The planimetry was transferred to the base map from the aerial photos by means of a multiscope. Fuel types were also determined from the photos. Other maps, including the proposed road and water development map, the hour control map and the seen area map, were also prepared. They were not particularly dependent upon the photographs for their information, except that the roads were located along old railroad grades and the water holes were beaver ponds, both of which could be observed on the photographs. A second land examination was made to correlate the types of vegetation on representative areas with the vegetational types given those areas from aerial photograph interpretation. Certain changes were made where the land examination showed the stocking or the species composition to differ from the photo interpretation. Well defined areas of each type were examined by the <b>stocked</b> <b>quadrat</b> method of reproduction examination and final classifications were based on the results. In conclusion to {{the first part of the}} thesis the author states that the field work in preparing a reforestation plan can be reduced to one-fifth of the time required by land examination alone. Forest boundaries and type boundaries may be easily recognized on the photographs and transferred to the base map. Fuel type and hour control maps may be made from the photos. Seen area maps may not be made from photographs without first constructing a topographic map. Tree species can be recognized to a certain degree from the photographs. Pure fir stands can be differentiated from pure hemlock stands, but they are not easily separated when in a mixture. Alder stands can be separated from the willow-vine maple stands, but again not in mixtures. However it is easy to distinguish coniferous stands from the hardwoods. The degree of stocking on reforestated areas can be determined from aerial photo examination, but only when the young trees average better than five feet in height and two feet in crown diameter. Part Two of the thesis is a brief management plan for the Blodgett tract. It includes the history, physiographic features, and condition of the forest on the tract. Silivicultural recommendations are made and also the fire protection maps previously mentioned. The area has high site quality, ample moisture, deep soil, and is ideally suited to the growing of Douglas-fir veneer stock on a rotation of between 100 and 150 years. It is located close to the Columbia River, which facilitates the transportation of the timber products. There is an adequate supply of local labor. The author recommends the planting of non-stocked and understocked areas, the pruning of selected crop tress, and periodic thinnings. Also recommended is the construction of access and fire roads, and a program of rodent and game control to assist in the re-establishment of the forest...|$|E
30|$|Seedling {{regeneration}} was monitored at 40 permanently marked points {{located at}} 20 m intervals along the transect. At each point, {{the number of}} eucalypt seedlings was counted within a circular quadrat of 1.13 m radius (4 m 2) and {{the height of the}} tallest seedling of each species recorded. Counts were undertaken in December 2001; June 2002; and in December 2003, 2005, and 2009. Stem diameter was also recorded for individual plants once they attained a height of 2 m. Seedling densities on individual quadrats, including un-stocked quadrats, were averaged and converted to a per hectare equivalent. The number of <b>stocked</b> <b>quadrats</b> containing one or more live seedlings was used as a measure of site occupancy, consistent with regeneration survey practice common in eucalypt forests (Lutze et al. 2004).|$|R
40|$|This is an ecologically and managerially {{oriented}} {{research of}} Boswellia papyrifera {{in the western}} and southern sub-hills of Jebel Marra, an isolated volcanic massif {{in the heart of}} African content. The research was conducted in the period from April 2001 to Nov. 2002. This research attempted to study Boswellia papyrifera under the following aspects: land forms and soils, the growing stock, natural regeneration, seed and seed germination, phenology and resin collection. Four representative Boswellia sites were chosen for this study. Composite soil samples were taken for physical and chemical analysis. The systematic circular line-plot design was used for the inventory of the growing <b>stock,</b> <b>quadrats</b> as subplots were used for natural regeneration surveys. Germination and viability tests were carried out for the seeds. Resin collections on the basis of diameter at breast height were made, interviews with resin producers were carried out and finally the phenology of the species was observed. The most important results of this research are: Sloping sites were found to be representative for the occurrence of Boswellia papyrifera. Soils of Boswellia papyrifera are sandy loam to sandy clay loam. Ù¦ Boswellia papyrifera was found to be dominant, frequent, abundant and with an importance value index of 188. 5. Boswellia is a prolific seed producer, the seeds are three folds, empty, insect infested and viable seeds, and the latter are the smallest in number. The germination of seeds does not exceed 7 % under all treatments and the seedlings survival rates ranges from 27. 6 - 31. 8 %. The most important outcome of this study is the lack of natural regeneration. The main reasons behind are grazing, fires, weed competition and water erosion. The phenophases of the species were found to be determined by rain fall and the flowering habit of Boswellia papyrifera is indeterminate. The average annual resin production per tree is 1. 44 kg/tree, and the optimum productive diameter at breast height ranges between 16 - 34 cm., trees with diameters at breast height over 34 cm are less productive. Resin production was found to be affected by season. In the early season resin production is low and the intervals of collection is prolonged to four weeks, while in the late season resin production increases and the intervals of collections is shortened to two weeks...|$|R
