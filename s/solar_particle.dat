Solar elemental abundances pro-vide the most important benchmark for the chemical evolution of the galaxy. They {{can be derived from}} pho-tospheric observations, from in situ investigations of the solar wind, and from <b>solar</b> energetic <b>particles.</b> <b>Solar</b> isotopic abundances provide an important reference for the galactic evolution and if available with sufficient precision, also for the chemical and physical evolution of the solar system. The abundances of isotopes in the solar atmosphere can only be inferred from in situ observa-tions of <b>solar</b> <b>particles.</b> This review makes an attempt to summarize current knowledge about the composition of the solar wind and shows how the elemental, isotopic, and charge state composition of <b>solar</b> wind <b>particles</b> is shaped as the solar corona expands throughout the he-liosphere. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Solar Isotope Spectrometer (SIS) {{provides}} {{high resolution}} {{measurements of the}} isotopiccomposition of energetic nuclei from He to Zn (Z = 2 to 30) over the energy range from ~10 to ~100 MeV/nucleon. During large solar events SIS measures the isotopic abundances of solar energetic particles to determine directly {{the composition of the}} solar corona and tostudy particle acceleration processes. During solar quiet times SIS measures the isotopesof low-energy cosmic rays from the Galaxy and isotopes of the anomalous cosmic ray component, which originates in the nearby interstellar medium. SIS has two telescopes composed of silicon solid-state detectors that provide measurements of the nuclear charge, mass, andkinetic energy of incident nuclei. Within each telescope, particle trajectories are measuredwith a pair of two-dimensional silicon strip detectors instrumented with custom very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) electronics to provide both position and energy-loss measurements.SIS was especially designed to achieve excellent mass resolution under the extreme, high fluxconditions encountered in large <b>solar</b> <b>particle</b> events.
