Dressed in a sparkly pale-pink, [...] "princess-like" [...] dress and wearing glittery make-up, Perry {{sat on a}} swing that continued to rise high above the stage as she sang the lyrics to [...] "Not Like the Movies". MTV News reporter Mawuse Ziegbe called it a [...] "heartfelt tribute". Claire Suddath of Time magazine said the [...] "Valentine's Day–themed performance coupled with Perry's wedding footage made-up [...] for the swing {{that looked like a}} high school–yearbook photo backdrop". <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> a Suddath [...] "B+" [...] rating.

500|$|The {{one group}} number, [...] "Pure Imagination", {{received}} reviews that touched on the song itself {{as much as}} the performance. Fallon called it [...] "unsettling yet touching" [...] and Poniewozik described it as [...] "odd but perfect". Berk, on the other hand, characterized it as [...] "pure dreck". Benigno felt that while the song was [...] "really quite good", the [...] "stupidity of the scene" [...] it was in detracted from it, resulting in a grade of [...] "B+", while Gonzalez, when <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> an [...] "A−", said she hadn't been a [...] "huge fan of the cover" [...] when she heard it before the show aired, but it grew on her in context. Futterman wrote, [...] "The New Directions break into a restrained, tender take on [...] "Pure Imagination" [...] with lush harmonies on the chorus that's exactly right for the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the run of}} The Mikado, Bond met Lewis Ransome, a young civil {{engineer}} from a wealthy Quaker family. [...] He {{had just returned from}} America, and the two compared travel experiences. Ransome admitted to Bond that, after watching The Mikado, he had mentioned to his sister that he [...] "liked the little one with the big sash best. So next day when she saw a photograph of you in a shop window she went in and bought it. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> to me and I have it now." [...] Thus, despite Bond's aversion to romance, began a long friendship that led, twelve years later, to Bond's second marriage. Ransome, several years younger than Bond, proposed marriage on many occasions {{over the course of the}} relationship, but Bond told him that she would not marry while she continued on the stage. Over the years, the two spent many of Bond's days off (Sundays) relaxing together in the country.|$|E
500|$|The {{first song}} was [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin, which Bell said [...] "was a fun homage to Michael Jackson, and it {{set the tone}} for the rest of the episode". Futterman said that Blaine's [...] "slick showmanship" [...] made him a [...] "natural for lead vocals", and Slezak called it [...] "the best use of Darren Criss' voice on Glee in quite some time" [...] and gave it an [...] "A−". Lynch also gave it an [...] "A−", and said Criss [...] "captured the {{excitement}} and the spunky bravado of the original". Sullivan was another fan of [...] "the sheer awesomeness of Darren Criss" [...] on the song, and characterized it as [...] "a tribute that's more respectful than any other in the episode". Chaney dissented from the general approval; <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> a [...] "C+" [...] and wrote that [...] "the number was appropriately big and splashy, but musically, it sounded like all the funk had been drained right out of it". She described [...] "Bad" [...] similarly as <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> a [...] "C−": [...] "this tune also sounded noticeably defunkified". Sullivan was also unimpressed; he wrote that the performance let [...] "the world know what 'Bad' sounds like after it's drained of every ounce of danger". Lynch gave it a [...] "B" [...] and wrote that [...] "as silly as a choreographed gang fight between teenagers in a parking lot sounds (and was), the choreography was crisp and the attitude was a lot of fun". Slezak also praised the fight choreography, and stated that he [...] "got chills" [...] when Santana sang the chorus, and gave the song a [...] "B+". Futterman noted the [...] "interesting twist" [...] in the song's arrangement [...] "thanks to the Warblers' penchant for a cappella", and said that [...] "Artie and Santana" [...] began their battle for [...] "vocal MVP of the episode" [...] with [...] "Bad". Votta described the number as [...] "up there with the Dreamgirls performance from earlier this season as one of the strangest and best things Glee has done".|$|E

500|$|... "Last Friday Night" [...] evoked a {{wide range}} of {{opinions}} from reviewers. Chaney wrote that the performance [...] "incorporated several Glee tropes" [...] and was a routine seen before; <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> a [...] "B−". Futterman characterized the choreography as [...] "full of forced sunshine" [...] and said [...] "Blaine's normally effortless voice sounds breathy". West noted that the song [...] "wasn't the best showcase for his voice" [...] but added that [...] "it was exactly the playful little interlude it needed to be", and gave it a [...] "B+". Goldberg called it [...] "fantastic", and Kubicek said [...] "it's hard not to love his singing". Slezak stated that [...] "Darren Criss is better than this song", and gave it a [...] "D". Votta pointed out that the song was [...] "one of the first truly current pop hits on Glee this season", described the performance as [...] "pure Glee" [...] and the dancing [...] "disorganized and joyful", and the whole number as why the show [...] "connects with the youth of America".|$|E
500|$|... "Forever Young" [...] {{generated}} differing {{reactions from}} reviewers. Slezak wondered whether Will's [...] "diminished role this year" [...] reduced {{the impact of}} his farewell song {{and gave it a}} [...] "B", and Futterman wrote that [...] "while the bare-bones guitar arrangement is suitably melancholy, Schue's voice never quite settles in, seeming forced the whole way through". Strecker thought [...] "it sounded lovely", gave it a [...] "B+" [...] and asked for more in the next season, and Chaney graded it an [...] "A" [...] and said that it was [...] "sweet". The same word, [...] "sweet", was applied by Slezak to Kurt's rendition of [...] "I'll Remember"; he called the song an [...] "underrated Madonna ballad" [...] and graded it a [...] "B+". Chaney, however, said it was [...] "not one of Madonna's best" [...] and the performance [...] "not particularly memorable", so <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> a [...] while Pinzivalli wrote [...] "leave this one to Madge". Futterman characterized Kurt as [...] "dapper and emotional while singing in a crisp, clear and natural voice", though she wanted the performance to be [...] "more than everyone's sad faces". Strecker's grade was an [...] and she wrote that [...] "Colfer sold it" [...] and that it was a [...] "nice arrangement for his voice".|$|E
500|$|... "Pam's Replacement" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall complimented the episode for staying true to the characters {{compared to the}} rest of the season, which he had criticized in an earlier review. He called the episode a [...] "significant step up" [...] albeit just [...] "decent" [...] in absolute terms. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt criticized the Andy–Kevin–Darryl subplot for its lack of continuity or any sort of punchlines. He was also critical of the Pam–Dwight plot for not staying true to the characters, and suggested that the writers needed to write the show as less of [...] "a bland copy of itself". He called it one of the laziest half-hours of the show and gave it a C−. Cindy White of IGN said that the episode needed a stronger A-plot writing that the plots [...] "felt like a meal made up of two tasty side dishes". <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> a 7 out of 10. Hanna Lawrence of Hollywood.com praised the episode for being believable and for showing things that happen in real life. She also praised the Jim–Pam plot for showcasing the couple as not completely [...] "perfect". She called the band subplot [...] "weak".|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Time Is On My Side", Dean discovers Bela {{no longer}} has the Colt. He later gets her {{criminal}} record from England and learns her true name is Abbie. Almost ten years prior, when she was 14, she had her parents killed in exchange for her soul as part of a ten-year deal made with a Crossroads Demon; though Dean believes that she killed them to inherit their fortune and Bela supports this story, the audience is shown a flashback that suggests that she had actually agreed to the deal to escape abuse from her father. Now desperate because her time is running out, Bela tries to kill the Winchesters, but they anticipate her and escape ahead of time. Dean then calls her a few minutes before her deal is up and she confesses to him she tried {{to get out of the}} deal with the Crossroads Demon by trading the Colt. Once <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> up, however, the deal changed so she had to kill Sam as well. Though Dean refuses her pleas for help, she reveals to him the demon Lilith holds all the contracts brokered by Crossroads Demons, including his own. Bela's deathand her soul's resulting descent into Hellis inevitable, but not shown.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} ranged from mixed to negative. TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw noted that Broyles [...] "is surely {{one of the}} most intense guys on TV", and also enjoyed Walter's scenes. Josie Kafka from Open Salon thought the fringe cases each week were [...] "an odd way to build a mythology: the Big Secret seems to be that people in {{positions}} of power are evil and do evil things, often for money. But if Peter's right, and all these stand-alones are also detailing a series of steps taken by the Big Bads in preparation for something... well, that's an exciting idea." [...] <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> [...] "two out of four Expendable Gerbils." [...] io9's Annalee Newitz praised the episode, declaring it made her [...] "officially a watcher of Fringe, rather than a sampler". She continued, [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the show really gelled... I think Fringe hit its stride last night because it finally showed us our main characters' true strengths... More importantly, Fringe has finally gotten into its main groove: human experimentation. That's what links all the scooby gang's investigations together into the Pattern, and that's what makes this show particularly timely in an age when people are scared of how biotechnology will change humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift wrote [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] {{during her}} {{freshman}} year, {{knowing that she}} and her senior boyfriend, Brandon Borello, would break {{up at the end of}} the year when he left for college.

[...] The nostalgic song describes a summer romance and Swift's hope that when Borello [...] "think Tim McGraw" [...] he would [...] "think [...] favorite song" [...] – McGraw's [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothin" [...] – and remember her. Conversely, [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] describes a girl furious after a break-up. Swift says that while the song is about [...] "just being mad" [...] and is [...] "completely, brutally honest"; <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> a comedic edge. While at work after school, Swift [...] "found self just sitting there with [...] guitar going, 'I hate his stupid truck that he doesn't let me drive. He's such a redneck! Oh my God!'," [...] a line which developed into the song's chorus. The up-tempo song is heavy with banjos and drums, while the chorus is marked by distorted guitars and big vocals.|$|E

500|$|Niffenegger {{began writing}} the novel in 1997; the last scene, {{in which an}} aged Clare is waiting for Henry, was written first, {{because it is the}} story's focal point. The {{narrative}} was originally structured thematically. Responding to comments from readers of early drafts of the manuscript, Niffenegger reorganized the narrative so that it largely followed Clare's timeline. The work was finished in 2001. With no history of commercial publication, Niffenegger had trouble finding interested literary agents—25 rejected the manuscript. In 2002, she sent it unsolicited to the small, San Francisco-based publisher MacAdam/Cage, where it reached Anika Streitfeld. Streitfeld, who became Niffenegger's editor, [...] "thought it was incredible. Right from the very beginning you feel like you are in capable hands, that this is someone who has a story to tell and who knows how to tell it." [...] <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> to David Poindexter, the founder of the publishing firm, [...] "who read it overnight and decided to buy the book". However, Niffenegger had acquired an agent by this time, and several publishing houses in New York City were interested in the novel. The manuscript was put up for auction and MacAdam/Cage bid US$100,000, by far the largest sum it had ever offered for a book. Although another publisher outbid them, Niffenegger selected MacAdam/Cage because they were so dedicated to her work. Also, Niffenegger explains that her [...] "own natural inclination is to go small. My background is in punk music—I'd always pick the indie company over the giant corporation." ...|$|E

In this story, Death's Head was becoming worried that {{he was starting to}} enjoy killing and was prolonging missions for fun rather than simply doing it for money. In addition, Death's Head's origins were revealed to him for the first time. His mechanoid body had originally been constructed to host the life energy of the techno-mage Lupex, a psychotic who hunted beings for sport and stole their bodies upon killing them. However, a woman named Pyra, who wished to steal Lupex' secrets, ultimately decided to use the mechanoid body against him. <b>She</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> a cold and calculating business-like mind, but before it could be used against Lupex, the body was stolen by an unknown party, enlarged {{to the size of the}} Cybertronians, and catapulted through time.
