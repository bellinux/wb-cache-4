60|$|This <b>submarine</b> <b>ridge</b> of mud, scoured by {{the stream}} {{out of the}} soft bottom {{of the river and}} heaped up far out on the hard bottom of the sea, was {{difficult}} to get over. The alluvial coast having no distinguishing marks, the bearings of the crossing-place had to be taken from the shape of the mountains inland. The guidance of a form flattened and uneven at the top like a grinder tooth, and of another smooth, saddle-backed summit, had to be searched for within the great unclouded glare that seemed to shift and float like a dry fiery mist, filling the air, ascending from the water, shrouding the distances, scorching to the eye. In this veil of light the near edge of the shore alone stood out almost coal-black with an opaque and motionless solidity. Thirty miles away the serrated range of the interior stretched across the horizon, its outlines and shades of blue, faint and tremulous like a background painted on airy gossamer on the quivering fabric of an impalpable curtain let down to the plain of alluvial soil; and the openings of the estuary appeared, shining white, like bits of silver let into the square pieces snipped clean and sharp out of the body of the land bordered with mangroves.|$|E

50|$|Sepioloidea pacifica, {{also known}} as the Pacific bobtail squid, is a species of {{cuttlefish}} native to the southern Pacific Ocean; it occurs off New Zealand in the west and in the Nazca and Sala y Gomez <b>submarine</b> <b>ridges</b> in the east.|$|R
50|$|The <b>submarine</b> <b>ridge</b> and Hut Point Peninusula temper {{the effect}} of McMurdo Sound ocean currents. Current meters {{indicate}} such minimal currents that the bay can be considered essentially stagnant. In addition the <b>submarine</b> <b>ridge</b> tends to provide a buffer against icebergs moving into the bay and damaging the ice pier and shoreline. Physical barriers created by such land forms have also concentrated toxic pollutants introduced into the bay from operations at McMurdo Station, according to a 1997 U.S. National Science Foundation sponsored study.|$|E
50|$|The <b>submarine</b> <b>ridge</b> {{is named}} after the Carlsberg Group brewery, because the Dana {{expedition}} (1928-1930) during which the ridge was discovered, {{was sponsored by the}} company.|$|E

50|$|Internal tides {{generated}} by tidal semidiurnal currents impinging on steep <b>submarine</b> <b>ridges</b> in island passages, ex: Mona Passage, {{or near the}} shelf edge, can enhance turbulent dissipation and internal mixing near the generation site. The development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability during {{the breaking of the}} internal tide can explain the formation of high diffusivity patches that generate a vertical flux of nitrate (NO3−) into the photic zone and can sustain new production locally.|$|R
40|$|A {{catalogue}} {{is presented}} of theoretical geoidal variations for {{three types of}} structural features common to the earth's surface: seamounts, <b>submarine</b> <b>ridges,</b> and <b>submarine</b> trenches. These structures were simulated by simple geometric shapes modeled in three-dimensions. A computer program calculated the potential and gravitational variations over the models.

50|$|Changes in {{bathymetry}} {{can affect}} the strength of an upwelling. For example, a <b>submarine</b> <b>ridge</b> that extends out from the coast will produce more favorable upwelling conditions than neighboring regions. Upwelling typically begins at such ridges and remains strongest at the ridge even after developing in other locations.|$|E

50|$|The {{underlying}} {{rocks are}} of upper Precambrian to lower Paleozoic age and are partly composed of calcium carbonate. The circulation of the Ross Sea {{is dominated by}} a wind-driven ocean gyre and the flow is strongly influenced by three <b>submarine</b> <b>ridges</b> that run from southwest to northeast. The circumpolar deep water current is a relatively warm, salty and nutrient-rich water mass that flows onto the continental shelf at certain locations.

50|$|The Chagos {{group is}} a {{combination}} of different coralline rock structures topping a <b>submarine</b> <b>ridge</b> running southwards across the centre of the Indian Ocean, formed by volcanoes above the Réunion hotspot. Unlike the Maldives, there is no clearly discernible pattern in the atoll arrangement, which makes the whole archipelago look somewhat chaotic. Most of the coralline structures of the Chagos are submerged reefs.|$|E
50|$|The islet {{takes its}} name from the Danajon Bank, the Philippines only double barrier reef {{and one of the few}} {{documented}} double barrier reefs in the world. A very rare geological formation, it comprises two sets of large coral reefs that formed offshore on a <b>submarine</b> <b>ridge</b> due to a combination of favorable tidal currents and coral growth in the area.|$|E
5000|$|The {{island is}} the eroded remnant of a [...] "hotspot" [...] shield volcano with a caldera complex or {{collapse}} feature (Liu Bench) {{on the south}} face. The summit of the island, called Lata Mountain, is at an elevation of 931 m, making it the highest point in American Samoa. The last known volcanic eruption in the Manu‘a Islands was in 1866, on the <b>submarine</b> <b>ridge</b> that extends westnorthwest towards nearby Ofu-Olosega.|$|E
5000|$|The {{archipelago}} is not, as {{is often}} supposed, {{the remains of a}} land bridge between Borneo and the Philippines. Rather, it is the exposed edge of small <b>submarine</b> <b>ridges</b> produced by tectonic tilting of the sea bottom [...] Basilan, Jolo, and other islands in the group are extinct volcanic cones rising from the southernmost ridge. Tawi-Tawi, the southernmost island of the group, has a serpentine basement-complex core with a limestone covering. This island chain is an important migration route for birds.|$|R
40|$|Allochthonous accreted terranes are exotic {{geologic}} {{units that}} originated from anomalous crustal regions on a subducting oceanic plate and {{were transferred to}} the overriding plate by accretionary processes during subduction. The geographical regions that eventually become accreted allochthonous terranes include island arcs, oceanic plateaus, <b>submarine</b> <b>ridges,</b> seamounts, continental fragments, and microcontinents. These future allochthonous terranes (FATs) contribute to continental crustal growth, subduction dynamics, and crustal recycling in the mantle. We present a review of modern FATs and their accreted counterparts based on available geological, seismic, and gravity studies and discuss their crustal structure, geological origin, and bulk crustal density. Island arcs have an average crustal thickness of 26 km, average bulk crustal density of 2. 79 g cm − 3, and three distinct crustal units overlying a crust–mantle transition zone. Oceanic plateaus and <b>submarine</b> <b>ridges</b> have an average crustal thickness of 21 km and average bulk crustal density of 2. 84 g cm − 3. Continental fragments presently {{on the ocean floor}} have an average crustal thickness of 25 km and bulk crustal density of 2. 81 g cm − 3. Accreted allochthonous terranes can be compared to these crustal compilations to better understand which units of crust are accreted or subducted. In general, most accreted terranes are thin crustal units sheared off of FATs and added onto the accretionary prism, with thicknesses on the order of hundreds of meters to a few kilometers. However, many island arcs, oceanic plateaus, and <b>submarine</b> <b>ridges</b> were sheared off in the subduction interface and underplated onto the overlying continent. Other times we find evidence of terrane–continent collision leaving behind accreted terranes 25 – 40 km thick. We posit that rheologically weak crustal layers or shear zones that were formed when the FATs were produced can be activated as detachments during subduction, allowing parts of the FAT crust to accrete and others to subduct. In many modern FATs on the ocean floor, a sub-crustal layer of high seismic velocities, interpreted as ultramafic material, could serve as a detachment or delaminate during subduction...|$|R
40|$|On cruises 10 and 15 of Academic Kurchatov (1971, 1973) at the Jan-Mayen Ridge, a {{large number}} of samples was obtained. Most of them {{contained}} sedimentary rocks. From their study, it is safe to assume that the rocks of the Jan-Mayen Ridge were, at first, subjected to subsidence to a considerable depth, and then uplifted to their contemporary position, by the ascending tectonic movements. Thus, the Jan-Mayen Ridge is in contrast to other Atlantic <b>submarine</b> <b>ridges,</b> not only in the sedimentary rock composition, but in the character of the tectonic movements...|$|R

40|$|Many {{volcanic}} constructs have geometric {{different shapes}} depending on different phenomena as parasitic cones, erosion or coral growth. In Lacey, Ockendon and Turcotte [11] the authors proposed a nonlinear model proving that {{the shape of}} volcanoes {{is determined by the}} hydraulic resistance to the flow of magma, from a line source, through the porous edifice. This model was later extended in Angevine, Turcotte and Ockendon [2] to include the shape of aseismic, <b>submarine</b> <b>ridges.</b> In this communication we propose a modification of the above mentioned models in order to simulate the more realistic case of volcanoes with a limited base.

40|$|Internal {{waves in}} the {{atmosphere}} and ocean are generated frequently from the interaction of mean flow with bottom obstacles such as mountains and <b>submarine</b> <b>ridges.</b> Analysis of these environmental phenomena involves theoretical models of non-homogeneous fluid affected by the gravity. In this paper, a semi-analytical model of stratified flow over the mountain range is considered under the assumption of small amplitude of the topography. Attention is focused on stationary wave patterns forced above the rough terrain. Adapted to account for such terrain, model equations involves exact topographic condition settled on the uneven ground surface. Wave solutions corresponding to sinusoidal topography with {{a finite number of}} peaks are calculated and examined...|$|R
