40|$|In {{this note}} {{we report on}} the {{evolution}} of between-sector wage inequality in the United States from 1969 – 2006. Our calculations take advantage of new NAICS sectoral classification, merging these with the earlier SIC scheme to achieve a single unified series. We compare this measure to the standard CPS-based Gini coefficient of household income inequality, showing that the evolution of the two series is very close. We show that between-sector variations dominate between-state variations in determining the evolution of inequality. The high importance of between-sector variations in driving overall U. <b>S.</b> <b>pay</b> inequality raises important questions about the standard invocation of education and training as a remedy for inequality, since the choice of specialization has become a speculative decision, whose income prospects depend heavily on {{the ebb and flow of}} sectoral economic fortunes. ...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of relativistic cosmology oscillating or cyclic models of the universe were introduced by A. Friedmann in his seminal paper of 1922. With the recognition of evolutionary cosmology in the 1930 s this class of closed models attracted considerable interest and was investigated by several physicists and astronomers. Whereas the Friedmann-Einstein model exhibited only a single maximum value, R. Tolman argued for an endless series of cycles. After World War II, cyclic or pulsating models were suggested by W.

All these studies deal with the homogeneous case, i. e., all stations share the same energy cost function. However, this assumption does not well model realistic scenarios in which the energy cost of a station varies dramatically depending on the particular enviroment conditions of its location. We introduce the weighted version of the range assignment problem in which the cost a station <b>s</b> <b>pays</b> to transmit to another station depends on the distance between the stations and on the energy cost of station s. Most of the algorithm results for the unweighted range assignment problem can not be applied to the weighted version.

The model determines the level of CEO pay across firms and over time, offering a benchmark for calibratable corporate finance. The sixfold increase of CEO pay between 1980 and 2003 can be fully attributed to the six-fold increase in market capitalization of large US companies during that period. We find a very small dispersion in CEO talent, which nonetheless justifies large pay differences. The data broadly support the model. The size of large firms explains many of the patterns in CEO pay, across firms, over time, and between countries. ...|$|R
