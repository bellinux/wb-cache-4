50|$|Oak {{artichoke}} galls, oak hop galls, larch-cone galls or hop <b>strobile</b> {{develop as}} a chemically induced distortion of leaf axillary or terminal buds on pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) or sessile oak (Quercus petraea) trees, {{caused by the}} parthenogenetic gall wasp Andricus foecundatrix (formerly Andricus fecundator), which lays single eggs within leaf buds using their ovipositor. The larva lives inside a smaller hard casing inside the artichoke and this is released in autumn. The asexual wasp emerges in spring and lays her eggs in the oak catkins. These develop into small oval galls which produce the sexual generation of wasps. A yew artichoke gall caused by the fly Taxomyia taxi also exists, but is unrelated to the oak-borne species. Previous names or synonyms for the species A. fecundator are A. fecundatrix, A. pilosus, A. foecundatrix (see below), A. gemmarum, A. gemmae, A. gemmaequercus, A. gemmaecinaraeformis and A. quercusgemmae.|$|E

40|$|A fossil with Gnetum {{affinity}} {{was found}} in the Jianshangou Member (Barremian Age) of the Yixian Formation (Lower Cretaceous Epoch) of the Jehol Group in western Liaoning, northeastern China. The single fossil specimen is represented by both elongate-cylindrical male spike <b>strobiles</b> which borne within a nodal bract of cauliflorous branch. The spike <b>strobiles</b> have apparent nodes, invisible internodes, and numerous verticillate involucral collars. The microsporangiate units within involucral collars are not seen. The male spike <b>strobiles</b> with verticillate involucral collars occur exclusively in Gnetum; hence, the fossil <b>strobiles</b> are attributed to a new taxon, Khitania columnispicata gen. & sp. nov., being closely related to Gnetum. The general isotopic dating suggests an age of Barremian, ca. 125 – 122 million years (Myr) ago for the Jianshangou Member. The palaeoecological and palaeoclimatic inference based on the compositions of flora and fauna, and lithological characters of the fossil locality suggests that the fossil plants grew in a subtropical mesophytic forest and under a warmer climate. The remains of male spike <b>strobiles</b> are the first record of gnetalean macrofossil.

50|$|Hops are {{the flowers}} (also called seed cones or <b>strobiles)</b> of the hop plant Humulus lupulus. They are used {{primarily}} as a flavoring and stability agent in beer, to which they impart bitter, zesty, or citric flavours; though they are also used for various purposes in other beverages and herbal medicine. The hop plant is a vigorous, climbing, herbaceous perennial, usually trained to grow up strings in a field called a hopfield, hop garden (nomenclature in the South of England), or hop yard (in the West Country and U.S.) when grown commercially. Many different varieties of hops are grown by farmers around the world, with different types being used for particular styles of beer.|$|R

40|$|International audienceBarbary macaques live {{in extreme}} {{temperate}} environments characterized by strongly seasonal resource availability. They are mainly terrestrial while foraging, harvesting {{food from the}} herbaceous layer. These monkeys are threatened mainly because of anthropogenic habitat degradation. We studied the adaptive capacities of wild groups of Barbary macaques that lived in different cedar forests undergoing varying extents of grazing pressure from domestic livestock. In all three sites, diet varied seasonally. Heavy grazing led to {{a significant decrease in}} herbaceous production and species richness. As a consequence, the monkeys' diet in this poor habitat showed a decreased plant species richness. Moreover, it incorporated fewer above‐ground herbaceous resources, and a greater proportion of subterranean resources (especially hypogeous fungi and subterranean invertebrates such as earthworms, eggs and adults of earwigs, and ant's larvae) than the diet of monkeys inhabiting ungrazed forest. Cedar bark, cedar <b>strobiles,</b> earthworms, and earwigs were part of the monkeys' diet only in grazed forest. Monkeys in heavily grazed forest compensated for a lack of herbaceous foods by eating subterranean foods preferentially to tree and shrub products. The foods they consumed take longer to harvest and process than the seeds or leaves consumed by Barbary macaques in less heavily grazed forest habitats. Our results suggest that monkeys do differ in their diets according to the degree of habitat change induced by human activities. They also highlight the dietary flexibility of Barbary macaques as a key element that allows them to cope with degraded habitats. We later compare the dietary adjustments of Barbary macaques facing environmental change to dietary strategies of other macaques and temperate‐zone primates...|$|R
40|$|AbstarctHerbal {{extracts}} targeting at {{the brain}} remain a continuous challenge to pharmacology. Usually, {{a number of}} different animal tests have to be performed in order to find a potential clinical use. Due to manifold possibly active ingredients biochemical approaches are difficult. A more holistic approach using a neurophysiological technique has been developed earlier in order to characterise synthetic drugs. Stereotactic implantation of four semi-microelectrodes into frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and reticular formation of rats allowed continuous wireless monitoring of field potentials (EEG) before and after drug intake. After frequency analysis (Fast Fourier Transformation) electric power was calculated for 6 ranges (delta, theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1 and beta 2). Data from 14 synthetic drugs – tested earlier and representative for different clinical indications – were taken for construction of discriminant functions showing the projection of the frequency patterns in a six-dimensional graph. Quantitative analysis of the EEG frequency pattern from the depth of the brain succeeded in discrimination of drug effects according to their known clinical indication (Dimpfel and Schober, 2003). Extracts from Valerian root, Ginkgo leaves, Paullinia seed, Hop <b>strobile,</b> Rhodiola rosea root and Sideritis scardica herb were tested now under identical conditions. Classification of these extracts based on the matrix from synthetic drugs revealed that Valerian root and hop induced a pattern reminiscent of physiological sleep. Ginkgo and Paullinia appeared in close neighbourhood of stimulatory drugs like caffeine or to an analgesic profile (tramadol). Rhodiola and Sideritis developed similar frequency patterns comparable to a psychostimulant drug (methylphenidate) as well to an antidepressive drug (paroxetine) ...|$|E
40|$|Mony Almalech uses {{reliable}} {{resources to}} reveal {{details on the}} money in the Old Testament – Jewish Encyclopedia (JE), The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (ISBE), BibleWorks 4, Электронная Еврейская Энциклопедия, and of course – the Bible itself. Some of these details are: - There is no special word for money in Hebrew. Most frequently the word for silver [kèsef] is used to denote a money transaction. - For money, as for weight, the shekel [shèkel] was the standard unit, the pieces of metal (gold or silver) being either fractions or multiples of the shekel. Very often the term shekel of silver [shèkel kèsef] is used. There was a Temple-tax, called shekel of the sanctuary [shèkel ha-kòdesh], which had different divisions in the different periods, according to the dominant system – half silver shekel (Exodus, 30 : 13), third silver shekel (Nehemiah, 10 : 33). The “half silver shekel of the sanctuary” consists of twenty gerahs [gerà] (Exodus, 30 : 13). The gerah is supposed {{to be some kind of}} seed, perhaps a bean or some such plant. - Before the Babilonian Exile (VI-th century B. C.) there is no data on coins used by Israelites. At that period the metals were weight but not coinaged. To disprove the opinion that during the whole period before the Exile coined money was unknown the passage in I Samuel, 9 : 8 is cited. Here it is related that Saul's slave gave him the fourth part of a shekel of silver, which he had with him. The conclusion, however, that this is a reference to coined money is too hasty. Even after the Babilonian Exile the coins are rarely mentioned in the text of Old Testament. Such coin is the Persian darics, denarii or Persian drahma [darkmonìm] (Ezra 8 : 27). - Mina [minà] is a unit consisting of shekels. In Bulgarian it is translated as фунт (funt) and in English as pound or mina. When the decimal system made its way into use, the gold mina as well as the silver mina was reckoned at 50 such shekels. Consequently there was (1) the Babylonian silver mina, equivalent to 50 / 45 = 10 / 9 of a mina of weight; (2) the Phenician silver mina, equivalent to 100 / 135 = 20 / 27 of a mina of weight. There was also Alexandrian mina. - Talent [kikàr]. The term kikar, generally rendered talent. It signifies something round or circular, suggesting a ring of this weight to be used as money. The bundles of money carried by the sons of Jacob to Egypt for the purchase of grain (Genesis, 42 : 35) were probably silver rings tied together in bundles. It is evident from the Talmud (Bek. 5 a) that a kikar contained sixty mina. But there are different mina – Hebrew, Babylon, Egypt, Attic. - Ephah [ephà]. Very often [ephà] is used in exchange transactions despite that it is a measure of capacity but not of weight. It is a dry measure. According to BibleWorks 98 the ephah is about 60 kilograms. - There were three different systems for weights and money – Egyptian, Babylonian and Phoenician. In different periods the Jews used different one. One of the differences between Babylonian and Egyptian systems was the Decimal and sexagesimal division of an unite. - Everyone of these three systems had heavy (“royal”) and a light (“common”) talent, mina, shekels, gera et ctr. - Almalech shows in linguistic analysis of the Hebrew words, and the Hebrew and Bulgarian text of the Bible. For example the word [shèkel] means ‘be weight’; from the same root is the noun balance, scales [mishkàl], the verb to measure, to weigh [shakàl]. - Archeological finds are cited – the weights (shekels) were made as little sculptures – in the form of spindle or barrel, each have 12 faces, some of them has a lion stamped on each face save one, reminding of the lion-weights discovered in Assyria and Babylonia. Some weights are of black stone, the others of bronze. - The hypothesis of Sir Charles Warren is taken for basis of speculation because it represents a system of synonymy measures for the elements and the dimensions of the world. Egyptians and Babylonians built different systems on the following relations: cubes of the measures of length and ascertained how many grains of barley corresponded to the quantity of water these cubes would contain; the weight of a cubic inch of rain water – grains; a talent weight of a cubit cubed, equal to the weight of grains; deriving from this the minah (1 / 60 of the talent) of 9, 600 grains, and a shekel (1 / 50 of the minah) 192 grains. - Almalech recalls the “toys of Zagrei” or “the sacral objects”. Zagrei is a chthonic-solar hypostasis of Thracian Dionis. They are bowl, sphere, <b>strobile,</b> rhomb, miror, and apple. The “toys of Zagrei” are magical objects referring to the doctrinal grading of the structure of the Cosmos. They were used also for mythological designation of the initiation into the Orphic cult in the Ancient Thracian and Greek world. Comparing the “toys of Zagrei’ to the sculpture and geometrical forms of weights, Almalech represents the hypothesis that the spring of the money is hidden into the religious secret knowledge of ancient initiated people. They presented their knowledge on the structure of the Universe in the geometrical and sculpture forms of the ancient weights. Afterwards a different cultural and social process took place – the coinage of money. ...|$|E
