There are three types: an [...] "ordinary" [...] (ilban;일반) taxi; a [...] "model" [...] (mobum;모범) taxicab, which is painted black and is bigger and much more expensive; and a 'taxicab for the {{handicapped}}' (jang-e-in call taxi;장애인콜택시), which is a yellow painted van for the handicapped people who are living around Seoul. There are also two types of taxicab drivers' license: all taxicab drivers start driving their taxicab as employees in the taxicab companies, and these taxicabs that belong to a company are called 'corporate' (bubin;법인) taxicabs. After years of service in the taxicab company, drivers get a license which allows them to purchase their own vehicle and drive it as a <b>self-employed</b> <b>driver,</b> and the taxicabs they then drive are called 'individual' (gaein;개인) taxicabs.|$|E

40|$|Transaction {{cost and}} agency theorists have {{frequently}} cited trucks as prototypical userowned assets, and have consequently predicted a predominance of <b>self-employed</b> <b>drivers</b> who contract with motor carriers. In fact, owner-operators accounted {{for less than}} one-third of trucking activity conducted by large interstate trucking firms in 1991, a proportion that has changed little since deregulation. Given the predictions of organizational economists, why is self-employment in the interstate trucking industry not the dominant organization form? We propose that transaction costs and agency costs are indeed important in the trucking industry, but those that influence the employment mode for drivers are somewhat different than those that have received attention in prior work. Drawing on parallels to a franchiser’s choice between franchised and company-owned outlets, we explore the tradeoffs that a carrier faces in choosing between owner-operator and company drivers: similar to franchisees, owner-operators offer higher incentive intensity but also increased risks of quality shading and haggling over quasirents. We identify characteristics of trucking that can create conditions of asset-specificity not typically found in franchising. We also note how two unique features of trucking – mobility o...|$|R

50|$|The {{bus service}} {{underwent}} an extensive reform in July 2011. The management structure changed from having <b>self-employed</b> <b>drivers</b> driving their own vehicles to a service being {{offered by a}} single company through a public tender (in Gozo, being considered as a small network, the service was given through direct order). The public tender was won by Arriva Malta, {{a member of the}} Arriva group, which introduced a fleet of brand new buses, built by King Long especially for service by Arriva Malta and including a smaller fleet of articulated buses brought in from Arriva London. It also operated two smaller buses for an intra-Valletta route only and 61 nine-metre buses, which were used to ease congestion on high density routes. Overall Arriva Malta operated 264 buses. On 1 January 2014 Arriva ceased operations in Malta due to financial difficulties, having been nationalised as Malta Public Transport by the Maltese government, with a new bus operator planned to take over their operations in the near future. The government chose Autobuses Urbanos de León as its preferred bus operator for the country in October 2014. The company took over the bus service on 8 January 2015, while retaining the name Malta Public Transport. It introduced the pre-pay 'tallinja card'. With lower fares than the walk-on rate, it can be topped up online. The card was initially not well received, as reported by several local news sites.

30|$|De Groen and Maselli [48] {{claim that}} the ongoing digital {{revolution}} and crowd platforms are slowly changing labour by intermediating work between individuals online, without the intervention of other people or organisations. For the traditional logistics industry, CL can be considered disruptive. As numerous start-ups are creating business models based on low cost structure and power of community, business volume of traditional LSP’s can reduce significantly [23, 26]. Even more, as the crowd only works when demand is sufficient [15], the procedure {{can be used to}} replace fixed employees and create cost-efficiency and savings (third party involvement). This again traces back to the blurring lines between professionals and non-professionals in the logistics industry or the character and incentivisation of the crowd. The opportunity to create a customised working schedule that fits other commitments [23], the ease to convert time and skills into cash [48] and the ability to be in control of amount of work and revenues are key advantages of the system [14]. Some warn for negative side-effects of such flexibility. Although the crowd participates on a voluntary basis, some CL initiatives use a casual workforce of <b>self-employed</b> <b>drivers</b> and have been criticised for exploitative practices [46]. Platforms limit the freedom of the crowd in order to increase efficiency, for example by allocating tasks to workers that are most available or by attaching rating systems to task acceptance levels. Hence, the platform and platform users are far more dominant in setting the conditions for the crowd {{than the other way around}} [48]. De Groen and Maselli [48] summarise that the crowd is exposed to financial insecurities, lacking social protection, isolation and stress, blurring lines between the sphere of work and private life, high competition and uncertainties due to short-term schedules. Under-payment and unfulfilled employment conditions could prove to be an unsustainable business model from a social point of view. While these considerations relate to CL concepts on the business side of the strategic axis, they are less relevant for community-oriented approaches, which are small-scale and less driven by financial motivation.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the change of Bali society in the period of global tourism. Tourism has created {{employment}} opportunities and created an increase of population in Bali society. Today, other than Hindus who speak Balinese, many people of various ethnic groups who have immigrated from other areas of Indonesia live in Bali. At the same time, tourism has changed the paddy fields into residential lands and disorganized the traditional lifestyle of hundreds of Balinese who had been cultvating rice in the paddy field. 　The points that became clear from hearing investigation into members of a Balinese irrigation system (Subak) in Desa Pemogan are as follows. Today, in Desa Pemogan, there are hundreds of Muslim immigrant workers from Java and Lombok, as well as Bali Hindus. In addition, there are many people who are engaging in various occupations such as hotel and restaurant employees, <b>drivers,</b> <b>self-employed</b> people, and other non-farming occupation. Immigrant workers consist of two categories. One is that of low wage day laborers and the employees of self-employed people. The other is the managers of self-employed people. The former are called 2 ̆ 7 KIPEM 2 ̆ 7 (Kartu Identitas Penduduk Musiman), who are short term laborers from other areas of Indonesia. The latter are better off financially.

40|$|On leur prête l’indépendance, la capacité à se protéger seuls et à établir un équilibre dans leurs rapports avec les donneurs d’ouvrages, mais ces attributs sont loin de refléter la réalité de certains travailleurs autonomes. En approchant l’industrie du taxi et plus précisément la {{situation}} des chauffeurs locataires de taxi, le présent article examine l’état du droit sur cette question au Québec et en France, en discute et propose l’élaboration d’un régime-cadre de représentation collective pour le Québec. Self-employed workers {{account for}} 15. 4 % of the workforce. They form a heterogeneous group {{that the law}} merges into a single legal category, that of independent contractors. Such a categorization postulates that these workers {{have the capacity to}} protect themselves and to strike a balance in their dealings with those who supply work. However, this is far from reflecting the reality of some self-employed workers who rather find themselves in a precarious situation. Recently in France and in Quebec, the issues of status and of protection mechanisms have been raised with respect to a very specific category of <b>self-employed</b> workers, taxi <b>drivers</b> who rent their vehicles (lessees). The {{purpose of this article is}} to analyze the legal treatment given to these precarious self-employed workers in the context of two different industrial relations systems. The author thus pursues two objectives. The first consists of examining how the industry functions in order to understand what the literature means by heterogeneity and precariousness regarding some self-employed workers, based on the case of lessee taxi drivers. The second aims to reflect on the measures implemented in Quebec and in France regarding this very specific case. How have these experiences contributed to easing the workers’ precarious situation? What lessons can we in Quebec learn from each of these experiences?The article begins with a description of the organization of work in the taxi industry and of the people who provide the transportation service. Companies that own taxi fleets have cars that are equipped for taxi use, and use dispatch services which forward calls to the vehicles. As for the drivers, their task is to transport the client. These drivers may work as employees or as owners, but are lessees in 70 % of cases in Quebec and in 53 % of cases in France. While employees benefit from a protective legal system, independent contractors, whether they be lessees or owners, do not. Many studies reveal the precarious working conditions of lessee drivers, which is particularly due to the organization of their work. The article continues by recounting two events that have questioned the legitimacy of the legal framework for lessee taxi drivers. The first event occurred in 2000 before the Court of Cassation in France. The Court redefined the taxi driver’s rental contract as an employment contract by asserting the “state of subordination” in which lessees found themselves. In reaching its decision, the Court considered the likely effects of the contract and concluded that there was a relationship of legal subordination and, hence, an employment contract. This bold reasoning was not reproduced in Quebec since, for many years now, the fate of lessee drivers has been sealed by the courts, which refused to redefine the rental contract as an employment contract. Rather, it was the government who, in 2001, intervened to regulate the industry by officially creating the Association professionnelle des taxis to promote the interests of taxi drivers. Snubbed in favour of other actors, such as the FTQ Syndicat des Métallos (Steelworkers Union), this organization has never been able to truly fulfill its mandate, undoubtedly because of the lack of a distinct status for the drivers it represented. Ultimately, this legislative reform did not change the legal characterization of lessee drivers, and did not provide any solutions for their precarious situation. Instead, it instituted the industry as being unregulated. In light of developments on both sides of the Atlantic, what lessons can be drawn, for Quebec, from the legal framework regarding lessee drivers?This is the focus of the last section, in which the author draws lessons from these two experiences regarding lessee taxi drivers, based on their own context of regulation. She notes that these experiences have helped to identify and to characterize the precariousness faced by lessee drivers (Rodgers and Rodgers, 1989) and to reveal the type of legal framework that would be desirable for these drivers in Quebec. In this respect, it would appear that redefining the rental contract of lessee drivers as an employment contract would not be desirable for various reasons, however, nor would maintaining lessee drivers in situation of absence of regulation. To remedy the precarious situation of lessee taxi drivers, the author proposes to draw upon one of the proposals put forward in the Bernier report (2003), which consists in creating a general program for the collective representation of non-salaried workers and adding a funding mechanism. The characteristic professional and socio-economic conditions of precariousness for lessee drivers make this grouping “an appropriate field of activity” for representing all lessee drivers belonging to this field of activity and enabling them to negotiate collective agreements that are adapted to the system of industrial relations. The right to unemployment insurance may also serve as a model for the collection and financing of this association. Such a proposal has the advantage of providing a common social security plan that, with government support, enables the expression of the collective autonomy of these self-employed workers. Se les atribuye independencia, capacidad de protegerse solos y de establecer un equilibrio en sus relaciones con los contratistas, pero estos atributos son lejos de reflejar la realidad de ciertos trabajadores autónomos.
