25|$|The Triple A's chief nemesis at the time, the far-left {{terrorist}} group Montoneros, claimed up to 1,000 lives from 1970 until their elimination in 1976. They also perpetrated {{a number of}} high-profile ransom kidnappings, notably that of Jorge and Juan Born in September 1974. The Born brothers, directors of what was then one of Argentina's largest conglomerates (Bunge y Born) paid US$60 million for their release in June 1975, a world record at the time. At least US$14 million of these proceeds were laundered by David Graiver, a real-estate developer. Graiver fled Argentina in 1975 and settled in Manhattan, from where he bought controlling <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of banks in the U.S. and elsewhere. He reportedly {{died in a plane}} crash near Acapulco in August 1976, however, leaving US$45 million in bad debts that resulted in the collapse of American Bank & Trust – at the time the 4th largest bank failure in U.S. history.

New York Judge Arnold Fraiman ultimately ruled in January 1979 that Graiver was deceased, although he did so with reservations.|$|E
