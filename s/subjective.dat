5|$|Eliminativism about a {{class of}} {{entities}} is the view that that class of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; and modern physicists are eliminativist {{about the existence of}} luminiferous aether. Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental entities that common sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and the <b>subjective</b> sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism about qualia (<b>subjective</b> interpretations about particular instances of <b>subjective</b> experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Putnam's {{internal}} realism {{has been}} accused by Curtis Brown of being a disguised form of <b>subjective</b> idealism. If this is the case, it {{is subject to the}} traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls into the trap of solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as <b>subjective</b> idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness were to stop existing, then the rest of the universe would stop existing as well.|$|E

5|$|No {{constituents}} of the body—in the brain or elsewhere—transform into mental states and processes. Such <b>subjective</b> experiences do not {{emerge from the}} body, but neither do they emerge from nothing. Rather, all objective mental appearances arise from the substrate, and all <b>subjective</b> mental states and processes arise from the substrate consciousness.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{also held}} that legal {{precedents}} from other Commonwealth jurisdictions supported {{a rejection of}} the <b>subjective</b> test in favour of the objective test. The <b>subjective</b> test was applied in Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) and subsequently affirmed in Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941). However, these decisions had been departed from in subsequent decisions by the Privy Council and House of Lords. These courts had rejected the <b>subjective</b> test applied by the majority in Liversidge, preferring the objective test applied by Lord Atkin in his dissenting judgment. In the light of these developments, the Malaysian case of Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister for Home Affairs), Malaysia (1969), which had applied the test in Liversidge and which the respondents' counsel had relied on in support of the <b>subjective</b> test, could no longer be considered good law. Additionally, Teh Cheng Poh v. Public Prosecutor (1978) decided by the Privy Council on appeal from Malaysia, was referred to by the Court in support of the objective test. The case concerned the exercise of discretionary power under the Malaysian Internal Security Act, which the ISA of Singapore is derived from.|$|E
5|$|The {{possible}} inconsistencies the <b>subjective</b> test {{had with}} respect to Articles12 and 93 of the Constitution were sought to be resolved {{with the passing of}} the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989. Article149(1) was amended to shield any anti-subversion laws enacted pursuant to this provision from inconsistency with Articles11 and 12. This was in addition to Articles 9, 13 and 14 which had already been present in Article149(1) before the amendment. Furthermore, a new Article149(3) provided that nothing in Article93 would invalidate any provisions that were enacted pursuant to Article149. Hence, the ruling in Chng Suan Tze that the <b>subjective</b> test was inconsistent with the Constitution was legislatively reversed, and the <b>subjective</b> test was restored as the valid and relevant law in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The <b>subjective</b> {{test was}} {{rejected}} {{for several reasons}} by the Court of Appeal. It held that applying the <b>subjective</b> test to sections 8 and 10 of the ISA would render the provisions unconstitutional. The word law in Article 12(1) of the Constitution was held in Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980) to encompass fundamental rules of natural justice. Hence, Parliament cannot pass legislation which authorizes the executive to exercise power in breach of these fundamental rules or to exercise power in an arbitrary manner. If the <b>subjective</b> test were to be adopted, it would in effect allow the executive to exercise arbitrary powers of detention, therefore rendering sections8 and 10 of the ISA inconsistent with Article12(1). When the case was decided, Article149(1) of the Constitution, which protects the validity of anti-subversion laws notwithstanding inconsistencies with specified fundamental liberties, did not cover inconsistencies with Article12. Also, the Court noted that adopting the objective test {{would be consistent with}} Article93 of the Constitution, which vests judicial power in the courts. It did not, however, directly address the argument by counsel that the <b>subjective</b> test, in conferring arbitrary powers of detention, would be inconsistent with Article93.|$|E
5|$|But beyond that, {{it makes}} no effort to address the <b>subjective</b> vs. {{objective}} question, nor does its discussion of intent delve into the matter of specific vs. general intent. Some appeals courts, however, have developed more specific entrapment tests on their own.|$|E
5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} <b>subjective</b> and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The <b>subjective</b> case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both {{in the sense of the}} previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). <b>Subjective</b> case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E

As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the <b>subjective</b> and objective returns in the final scene.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal {{expanded}} the scope of judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive discretion. In contrast to the <b>subjective</b> test, the objective test permits the court to examine whether the decision-maker's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes specified by the ISA. The <b>subjective</b> satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test was only part of the obiter dicta of the case. The ratio decidendi of the case was based on narrower technical grounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seminal}} Court of Appeal {{decision}} Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the respondents submitted that the President's discretion under section 8(1) was <b>subjective,</b> {{and so was}} not open to review by the courts. The appellants argued that the discretion was objective, and thus {{a court of law}} could review the grounds on which the discretion had been exercised. The Court held that an objective test applied to the subjectively worded powers in sections 8 and 10, and hence the exercise of these powers was normally challengeable on the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. In coming to this decision, it disapproved of a 1971 High Court decision, Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, which had held to the contrary. While the Court's views regarding the applicability of an objective test were obiter, later Singapore decisions have confirmed this as the correct approach. It gave several reasons for its decision. First, the reasoning in cases supporting a <b>subjective</b> test was found to be questionable, and, secondly, such a test was inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Finally, the notion of a <b>subjective</b> or unfettered discretion was contrary {{to the rule of law}} and all powers had legal limits.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people can}} only judge of things by the {{experiences}} of ordinary life, but phenomena {{outside the scope of}} this are really quite numerous. How insecure it is to investigate natural principles using only the light of common knowledge, and <b>subjective</b> ideas.|$|E
5|$|One {{approach}} is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more probable. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about what precise probability any given evidence justifies putting on the general statement. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are <b>subjective,</b> or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's <b>subjective</b> beliefs over time.|$|E

5|$|The 1989 {{amendments}} to the ISA were challenged before the High Court in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989). Justice Frederick Arthur Chua held that sections 8B(1) and 8B(2) of the ISA govern judicial review {{in the context of}} that Act, and thus preclude any consideration of the legal position laid down in the obiter remarks of the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze. Therefore, applying the <b>subjective</b> test, the respondents' burden of justifying the legality of the applicant's detention was discharged as the respondents had produced a valid detention order and evidence of the <b>subjective</b> satisfaction of the President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, that the applicant was a risk to national security.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{subjectivity}} and objectivity {{can be divided}} into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the <b>subjective</b> is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out <b>subjective</b> interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ.|$|E

5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} objectivity and subjectivity. Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the <b>subjective</b> meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more <b>subjective</b> ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of <b>subjective</b> understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E

25|$|<b>Subjective</b> {{tinnitus}} is {{the most}} frequent type of tinnitus. It can have many possible causes, but most commonly it results from hearing loss.

25|$|DeNeve (1999) {{argued that}} there are three trends in the {{relationship}} between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies (emotional stability, positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. trust, affiliation) are important for <b>subjective</b> well-being. Happy people tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the way people think about and explain events is important for <b>subjective</b> well-being. Appraising events in an optimistic fashion, having a sense of control, and making active coping efforts facilitates <b>subjective</b> well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates <b>subjective</b> well-being.|$|E

25|$|Generally, the {{well-being}} {{of those who are}} employed is higher than those who are unemployed. Employment itself may not increase <b>subjective</b> well-being, but facilitates activities that do (such as supporting a family, philanthropy, and education). While work does increase well-being through providing income, income level is not as indicative of <b>subjective</b> well-being as other benefits related to employment. Feelings of autonomy and mastery, found in higher levels in the employed than unemployed, are stronger predictors of <b>subjective</b> well-being than wealth.|$|E

25|$|While {{objective}} truths are {{final and}} static, <b>subjective</b> truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and <b>subjective</b> {{experience that is}} always {{in the process of}} becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through <b>subjective</b> experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the <b>subjective</b> experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.|$|E
