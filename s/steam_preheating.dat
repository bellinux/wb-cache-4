40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} possibilities to reduce primary steam consumption of the integrated pulp and paper mill in Obbola. For this purpose, a pinch analysis has been performed. The thesis {{has been carried out}} on site and necessary data for the analysis was produced mainly using the sensors installed for controlling the process. Based on the data, a representation of the heat exchanges at the mill was obtained and from this emerges an understanding of how optimized the heat exchange is. From the analysis, {{it was found that the}} energy savings potential amounts to 7 MW, which corresponds to 6 % of present steam consumption of approximately 112 MW. One of the identified pinch violations was the flue gases in the recovery boiler used to preheat combustion air and process ventilation when it can be used to meet a thermal demand at higher temperatures or potentially to generate steam, the latter has not been investigated. <b>Steam</b> <b>preheating</b> of air to the paper dryer, <b>steam</b> <b>preheating</b> of water that is used to thaw logs and steam that is used in some of the process ventilations were also among the identified violations. Possible measures to optimize heat exchange and eliminate pinch violations have been investigated. These include flashing of paper mill condensate to replace the live steam in the air preheaters to the paper dryer and replace this thermal energy with secondary heat in the feed water treatment plant. As well as using part of the heat from the flue gas cooling system to preheat feed water. Increasing the operational temperature in the water treatment plant turned out to be possible regardless of whether a flash is introduced or not. The savings with contra without the flash would amount to 1. 13 MW and 0. 85 MW, respectively, and the net heat savings of a reconstruction is only 0. 28 MW. The heat that can be released from the flue gas cooling system corresponds to 0. 46 MW and is expected to be higher in the summer when heat necessity in other ends of the system decreases. To suggest optimization of heat exchanges at the mill, it was also investigated how much excess of warm and hot water was that present in the secondary heating system. The investigation showed that if the temperature in the warm water tank would be regulated, an excess of hot water would be sufficiently large to provide secondary heat to the optimization measures discussed and to provide for all ventilations currently using live steam. In all cases profitability should be investigated and for the case of any ventilation consideration should be given to distance from a secondary heating source and if there is a glycol circuit present or not. ...|$|E
40|$|The Dual Receiver Concept {{presented}} in this paper improves the adaptation of the central receiver to the steam cycle in a solar thermal power plant. By combination of an open volumetric air heater and a tubular evaporator the Dual-Receiver Concept profits from the advantages of these two concepts while their characteristic problems are avoided. The water is evaporated directly in the tubular <b>steam</b> generator, <b>preheating</b> and superheating is done in heat exchangers by using the hot air from the volumetric receiver. The results confirm the benefits of the new concept, resulting from higher thermal efficiency of the receiver and lower parasitic power consumption.

The ASPEN Plus® RGIBBS reactor model was used to simulate both the reduction and oxidation reactors, using the Peng Robinson equation of state. Within the RGIBBS reactor, the equilibrium composition of all feasible combination of reactions within the thermodynamic domain was considered. The RGIBBS reactor calculates the most stable phase combination obtained through chemical reactions where the Gibbs free energy of the reaction system reaches its minimum at a fixed mass balance, constant pressure, and temperature. Besides the RGIBBS module, the other components simulated were cyclone units to separate solid and gas streams, and heat exchangers, in which <b>steams</b> are <b>preheated</b> to reach the temperatures of reaction and heat {{is removed from the}} reaction products.|$|R

In {{order to reduce}} energy usage, two opportunities for heat recovery and heat integration were identified. A feasibility study and economic analysis were performed on the two opportunities, and both projects were implemented. The first project utilized the heat contained in a distillation process overheads stream to preheat the raw material entering the distillation process. This was accomplished via a heat exchanger, and reduced the utility steam requirement by 10, 000 pph. The second project utilized the heat generated by the hydrogenation reaction (in the form of waste heat <b>steam)</b> to <b>preheat</b> the feed material in an adjacent process. This was accomplished via a heat exchanger, and reduced the utility steam requirement by 8, 000 pph.

40|$|Solar and biomass {{are both}} {{renewable}} energy resources. Using biomass as fuel {{is becoming more}} and more attractive after governments increase the tariff for the electricity from the renewable sources. However the costs of power from a biomass power generation plant depend greatly on the availability and quality of the biomass resource. The commercialization of solar alone thermal power generation is hindered by its high initial investment and low thermal efficiency. In this paper, a concept of integrating solar into a biomass power generation system is put forward. In the system the oil heated by a parabolic trough solar field is used to replace the extraction <b>steam</b> to <b>preheat</b> the feed water (entering a biomass boiler) and the previous extraction steam thus saved can continue to do work in the lower stages of turbine. The performance of the hybrid system with different replacements is analyzed and compared through two typical solar aided biomass generating units. The results show that the integration not only reduces the consumption of biomass fuel (at the same generation capacity) but is also proved to be an efficient way to convert solar thermal energy into power. The results also show that with the same solar aperture area, the higher the grade of the replaced extraction steam, the better the thermal performance and economy.

40|$|Evaporators can {{minimize}} {{the production of}} regulated waste residues, and increase the potential for recovering valuable materials from those wastes. Multiple-effect evaporators (MEEs) are common to industries that concentrate different products, regenerate solvents,or separate solid-liquid mixtures. Process integration can help to choose the best configuration of MEE {{in order to achieve}} a more efficient process in the sense of energy use. In present work a number of configurations and difficulties of MEE system such as condensate flashing, vapour bleeding, <b>steam</b> splitting, <b>preheating</b> of liquor using condensate, variable physical properties and boiling point rise are taken into consideration to develop different models of evaporation system. In the present work seven effect evaporator system of typical Indian pulp and paper industry is considered for analysis based on above configurations. These systems is described by a set of nonlinear algebraic equations that include total and solute mass balances, energy balances, heat transfer rate equations and the composition and temperature dependence of relevant thermodynamic properties such as vapour pressures and enthalpies. The models are solved using ‘system of nonlinear equations’. Pinch analysis of the MEE network is also done. Economic evaluation to optimize the number of flash tanks is carried out for seven effect evaporator system. The two different types of configuration of vapor bleeding are considered and comparison of both configurations is done. Considering the optimum number of flash tanks and the best configuration of vapor bleeding, a system was designed. Considering the maximum possible number of flash tanks and preheating of liquor using condensate,a final system was designed. This modified design enhances the steam economy by 23. 77...|$|R
40|$|Papermaking is {{a process}} where {{cellulose}} fibers suspended in water are dewatered step by step. In the final step, the remaining water is dewatered by evaporation when the paper web is in contact with steam-heated cylinders in the drying section. Even though the drying section only removes approximately 1 % of all the water, it uses as much as 2 / 3 of all the energy, in form of steam. The drying section of the paper machine PM 5 at Stora Enso Mölndal {{is divided into three}} parts, where the first part, the pre-dryer is responsible for {{the main part of the}} drying and thus also the main part of the energy consumption. Also being the bottleneck in the production the pre-dryer was the object of the investigation in this project. The aim of this project was to map out the energy flows within and around the pre- drying section and develop a computer model of it. This was done with the purpose of giving propositions of how the machine should be rebuilt to enable increased production and to give lower specific energy consumption. For the development of the computer model the simulation software WinGEMS 4. 0 was used, while this program is suitable for simulation of the pulp and paper industries. At first model parameters of the current machine were adjusted, on the basis of measurements done on the machine. This model was then modified to predict the results of different rebuilds. In parallel, pinch analysis was used to investigate the possibilities for heat recovery. The result of the study was that good heat recovery would decrease the specific steam consumption since heat exchange could, to some extent, replace <b>steam</b> for <b>preheating</b> incoming air. The heat exchange is facilitated by a well-designed air system, where air leakage is restricted. Investing in a better air system pays off, as it gives propitious drying conditions and hence somewhat higher production. A more efficient way to increase the production is to expand the pre-dryer with some extra cylinders. Finally, when combining expansion, better air system and better heat exchange the result will be a pre-dryer with increased production and low specific energy consumption...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a review of}} nuclear industry efforts to manage thermal fatigue, flow-accelerated corrosion, and water hammer damage to pressurized water reactor (PWR) feedwater nozzles, piping, and feedrings. The review includes an evaluation of design modifications, operating procedure changes, augmented inspection and monitoring programs, and mitigation, repair and replacement activities. Four actions were taken: (a) review of field experience to identify trends of operating events, (b) review of technical literature, (c) visits to PWR plants and a PWR vendor, and (d) solicitation of information from 8 other countries. Assessment of field experience is that licensees have apparently taken sufficient action to minimize feedwater nozzle cracking caused by thermal fatigue and wall thinning of J-tubes and feedwater piping. Specific industry actions to minimize the wall-thinning in feedrings and thermal sleeves were not found, but visual inspection and necessary repairs are being performed. Assessment of field experience indicates that licensees have taken sufficient action to minimize steam generator water hammer in both top-feed and <b>preheat</b> <b>steam</b> generators. Industry efforts to minimize multiple check valve failures that have allowed backflow of steam from a steam generator and have {{played a major role}} in several steam generator water hammer events were not evaluated. A major finding of this review is that analysis, inspection, monitoring, mitigation, and replacement techniques have been developed for managing thermal fatigue and flow-accelerated corrosion damage to feedwater nozzles, piping, and feedrings. Adequate training and appropriate applications of these techniques would ensure effective management of this damage...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} many ways to reduce the problems of releasing more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The potential for energy savings due to energy efficiency measures can be large in industrial processes, especially in energy intensive businesses such as the refinery industry. In this project the oil refinery Nynas AB, situated near the harbour in Gothenburg, is studied. The plant is specialized in producing bitumen and naphthenic oils, mainly for the Nordic market. The objective of this thesis is to investigate opportunities to increase process energy efficiency at the refinery Nynas AB. The main aim of the project is to locate energy savings by use of pinch analysis and to evaluate these. The primary focus of this study is the distillation section of the plant due to its large energy usage, 60 % of the total energy demand at the plant. Within the distillation area two distillation columns and a furnace are located. The present energy demand in this area is 6. 5 MW of heating and 5. 0 MW of cooling. The results of the pinch analysis indicate that the theoretical minimum energy demand for the plant is 3. 7 MW heating and 3. 1 MW cooling. This implies that there is a potential for savings of around 42 % for heating and 37 % for cooling. However a more advanced analysis of the plant indicates that it is complicated to retrofit, thus reaching these energy targets is not reasonable from an economic perspective. The focus of the study was therefore on identifying measures that save energy without attempting to reach the maximum energy savings target. Two retrofit suggestions was performed which both added a new heat exchanger to the heat exchanger train preheating crude oil with bitumen at the plant. The placement of the additional heat exchanger is different in the retrofit suggestions and gives different advantages concerning material, wear and size. The suggestions both decrease the energy demand in the furnace by 24 % and reduce about 55 % of the pinch violations. It would also decrease the CO 2 emissions by 7000 tonnes/yr due to reduced fuel demand. In both retrofit suggestions the steam generator producing 2 barg <b>steam</b> to <b>preheat</b> the feedwater was reduced. This was solved by utilizing the excess heat below the pinch to preheat the fresh water. Finally retrofit suggestion 1 with a new heat exchanger close to the furnace, using an appropriate construction material was recommended. This retrofit option was considered to protect of the existing heat exchangers. An economic analysis of retrofit options 1 and 2 showed a payback period corresponding to about 9 months for retrofit 1 and 18 months for retrofit 2. The conclusion is that further heat exchange in the process is something to recommend...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} application of modern control techniques to an industrial processing plant. The plant {{is made up of}} a pilot scale triple effect Wiegand falling film evaporator and a De Lavel tall form spray drier situated at the laboratories of the New Zealand Dairy Research Institute. The continuous version of the standard state space and measurement equations for linear, time-invariant, multi-variable systems provides the basis for the development. This standard representation is not well suited for direct application to the plant because of the difficulty in defining a suitable state vector and the difficulty in knowledge of the process dynamics. The standard representation is therefore enhanced to provide a modified structure that exhibits several significant features:- i) only measurable outputs, control inputs and measurable disturbances are involved in the process descriptions; ii) the equation structure {{is similar to that of}} the standard discrete state space equations, so that state space time domain control system design methods are applicable; iii) the structure is suitable for the direct application of statistical modelling; iv) maximum flexibility is offered for selection of discrete intervals for measurement samples and controls; v) precise knowledge of process time delays is not required. Application of the control strategies is performed using an IBM System/ 7 minicomputer. A suite of computer programs, developed in FORTRAN, is used. These programs are suitable for transferring to any other minicomputer supporting a multi-tasking mode of operation with the major system dependent area being the actual sampling of process data. Whilst a control engineer would be required for the installation of the software and initial control system design, further tuning of the controllers could be performed by a suitably trained operator. The procedures described allow an operator to apply sophisticated control techniques by following a sequence of relatively simple steps:- a) apply perturbations to normal plant operating conditions; b) use the interactive graphics facility to identify process models using the generalised least squares technique; c) choose appropriate design weightings and use a dynamic programming algorithm to obtain controller gains; d) simulate operation of the controller using the process model; e) apply the controller to the actual plant. Steps b), and c) and d may need to be repeated until a suitable controller is obtained. The results of the implementation of controllers on the pilot scale plant are presented. Consistent control of the product density and flowrate from the evaporator is obtained. As an hierarchical control structure has been used on the evaporator, the development of lower level controllers on variables such as <b>steam</b> flowrate, <b>preheat</b> temperature, inlet milk flowrate and condenser water temperature is also described. On the spray drier environmental control on concentrate flowrate, gas flowrate and drier chamber pressure is obtained...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the latest}} {{achievements}} in gasification technology, one may list {{the development of}} a method to preheat gasification agents using switched ceramic honey combs. The best output from this technology is achieved with use of water steam as a gasification agent, which is heated up to 1600 °C. The application of these temperatures with steam as a gasification agent provides a cleaner syngas (no nitrogen from air, cracked tars) and the ash melts into easily utilised glass-like sludge. High hydrogen content in output gas is also favourable for end-user applications. Among the other advantages of this technology is the presumable application of fixed-bed-type reactors fed by separately produced and <b>preheated</b> <b>steam.</b> This construction assumes relatively high steam flow rates to deliver the heat needed for endothermic reactions involving biomass. The biomass is to be heated uniformly and evenly in the volume of the whole reactor, providing easier and simpler control and operation in comparison to other types of reactors. To provide potential constructors and exploiters of these reactors with the kinetic data needed for the calculations of vital parameters for both reactor construction and exploitation, basic experimental research of high-temperature steam gasification of four types of industrially produced biomass has been conducted. Kinetic data have been obtained for straw and wood pellets, wood-chip charcoal and compressed charcoal of mixed origin. Experiments were conducted using two experimental facilities at the Energy and Furnace Division of the Department of Material Science and Engineering (MSE) at the School of Industrial Engineering and Management (ITM) of the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and at the Combustion Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of Maryland (UMD), USA. The experimental facility at the Energy and Furnace Division has been improved with the addition of several constructive elements, providing better possibilities for thermo-gravimetric measurements. The obtained thermo-gravimetric data were analysed and approximated using several models described in the literature. In addition, appropriate software based on the Scilab package was developed. The implementation of the isothermal method based on optimisation algorithms has been developed and tested on the data obtained under the conditions of a slow decrease of temperature in experiments with the char gasification in small-scale experimental facilities in the Energy and Furnace Division. The composition of the gases generated during the gasification of straw and wood pellets by high-temperature steam has been recorded and analysed for different experimental conditions.   QC 20101124 Study of ignition and kinetics of biomass/solid waste thermal conversion with high-temperature air/stea...|$|R
40|$|Catalytic {{ethylbenzene}} {{conversion to}} styrene {{which is one}} of the largest industrial processes worldwide was the main subject of this study. The surface structure of potassium-promoted iron oxide catalyst, which is the industrial catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, was studied. For that purpose ion scattering spectroscopy was used to determine the surface termination of this catalytic phase. The obtained observations, in agreement with previous studies, indicated that this phase is potassium terminated, and confirmed the fact that potassium should be on the surface of the catalyst to have its promoting action. There are several known drawbacks of the normal dehydrogenation process including endothermicity, deactivation and the large demand of <b>preheated</b> <b>steam.</b> Oxidative dehydrogenation process (ODH) of ethylbenzene is a promising candidate with several advantages. The absolutely metal free material Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG) was chosen as a model catalyst for the ODH of ethylbenzene over carbon materials whose catalytic activity in this process has attracted a lot of interest. Since oxygen-containing groups are supposed to be the active centres of the ODH reactions, argon- and oxygen-sputtering followed by exposure to oxygen atmosphere was used to create those groups. Only oxygen sputtering proved to be efficient in introducing surface oxygen functionality. The sputtered surface was investigated using thermal programmed desorption spectroscopy, auger spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. TPD spectra revealed low-temperature CO 2 and high-temperature CO desorption peaks. Using SEM and AFM, and comparing the heavily oxygen-sputtered surface with the smooth surface of the cleaved samples, many pits and pin holes were seen on the surface which indicates a significant damage of the surface by repeated oxygen sputtering. Upon performing reaction experiments on cleaved and oxygen-sputtered HOPG, a percentage yield of styrene ranging from 0. 25 – 0. 6 % was obtained according to reaction conditions without any obvious difference between the cleaved and the oxygen sputtered samples. The system sensitivity was tested and verified. Additionally, the detected activity was proved to be originating from ODH process by performing oxygen-free experiments. Reaction data was also used to determine the apparent activation energy (Arrhenius) which was found to be in the range of 50 kJ/mol for both the cleaved and the oxygen sputtered samples. The reason for the similar results observed was discussed and different explanations were given in which carbonaceous depositions over the catalyst surface play a major role. The reaction rate over HOPG samples was determined, and compared to the active catalyst (onion-like carbon), this comparison lead to the conclusion of the reasonability of using HOPG as a model catalyst for further studies. As a last step, different techniques including SEM, AFM and temperature programmed analysis were used to study the catalyst after reaction. Temperature programmed desorption of cleaved samples after reaction have shown desorption peak of CO which indicates the presence of carbonaceous depositions on the surface because the cleaved surface is known not to evolve any COx at the used temperature range. Temperature programmed oxidation indicated that the carbonaceous deposits are composed mainly of carbon and oxygen. These deposits did not show any obvious redox behaviour. Upon exploring the surface morphology, the cleaved surface was found to be smooth before and after reaction. This is explained by the building of carbon depositions in one layer. On the other hand, the oxygen-sputtered samples were found to be rough before reaction, after reaction, the surface was still rough. This was explained as the building of carbon depositions taking place extensively on the basal plane of HOPG and not on the whole surface.
