A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.|$|E
25|$|A balance {{disorder}} is a disturbance that causes {{an individual to}} feel unsteady, for example when standing or walking. It may be accompanied by feelings of giddiness, or wooziness, or having a sensation of movement, spinning, or floating. Balance {{is the result of}} several body systems working together: the visual system (eyes), vestibular system (ears) and proprioception (the body's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>where</b> it is in space). Degeneration or loss of function in any of these systems can lead to balance deficits.|$|E
25|$|Most of Coleridge's juvenalia was posthumously published. Those written {{while he}} {{attended}} Christ's Hospitals were imitations of conventional models of poetry {{during the late}} 18th-century. In particular, he focused on John Milton's L'Allegro, Il Penseroso, and his Lycidas, along with the poems of Collins, Gray, and Thomson. In terms of form, Coleridge relied on many abstract nouns that he would mark with capitalisation, and his nouns were constantly modified {{with a set of}} two adjectives. He did not start working with his own poetic form until 1794. Although they don't provide a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>where</b> Coleridge developed his poetry later, the school-age poems do give insight into Coleridge's thoughts and feelings during those years.|$|E

Lamb suggested that Stead meet with a [...] "critique group" [...] who would help read and revise the drafts Stead wrote. After Stead created a revised copy of the novel in 2005, she sent it to Lamb again and a contract was drawn up.

500|$|Scott Meslow for Vulture {{scored the}} episode four stars out of five, saying {{it makes the}} season's stakes clear by being an origin story for both Ghost Rider and Morrow, and praising the series for {{focusing}} on those elements {{rather than trying to}} closely tie-in with Doctor Strange as it did in previous seasons. Meslow also said that Gabe Reyes was [...] "a welcome addition, successfully recognizing and calling out anything that seems like bullshit." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick at ScreenCrush said the episode was easily the best of the season so far, though he was still [...] "on the fence as to whether Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has the clearest <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>where</b> Season 4 is going". Fitzpatrick noted that Lucy had [...] "inarguably [...] the weakest element" [...] of the season and was not surprised with the Morrow reveal, and questioned the series' stance on the morality of the Ghost Rider, feeling that it should have been made more clear. He added that the episode [...] "seemed to position itself a bit better with regard to coming episodes".|$|E

This is the first episode of the series that Jon Hamm had directed, with Hamm saying that he owes thanks to John Slattery for paving the way. As preparation for directing the Rolling Stones concert, Hamm looked over archival photographs of the original concert. [...] "They were kids. The Rolling Stones. It was them and The Beatles. These huge pop explosions. People were really excited about {{it and it was}} a really big deal. And, in a larger sense, gave us a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>where</b> advertising is going." [...] Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that [...] "My job was not {{to go in there and}} muck it up and say, [...] "I'm gonna put my stamp on this." [...] My job was to go in there and keep the train on the tracks, basically. We have a very firmly established tone and look to our show that people respond to, and that I love."

Chris Dart of Exclaim! said, [...] "It's also a smart, fun, eclectic record full of psychedelic influences and great, massive choruses."

[...] Dan Buyanovsky of XXL stated, [...] "As a whole, Cudi’s version of 2001 is an original and bold project [...] This ambitious project does not fall flat, and credit is due to Cudi for continuing to challenge himself post-WZRD, taking on a new skill-set and concept rather than throwing together a collection of identically moody anthems." ...|$|E

[...] And {{the way we}} tell stories will be {{different}} too", and confirmed that the [...] "whooshing sound" [...] effect {{will continue to be}} used as the transition for the new storytelling device. [...] When asked if episodes continue to focus on specific and different characters, actor Jorge Garcia, who portrays Hurley Reyes, replied that [...] "It's not as clear cut as it's been in the past. We don't have the moments where someone stares off into space and then we cut to something that happened in their previous life. [...] They've gone in a slightly different direction as far as how they're telling the story and they're definitely trying to show what's going on with more people in every given episode." [...] The script included scenes with all the main characters, including Desmond in the ending, because the writers felt that after a long break the audience would like to see every character again. Like the previous three season openers, the opening scene was meant to make viewers [...] "not supposed to have any <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>where</b> and when we are". But while the other premieres had the teaser connecting into the main plot of the episode, the writers decided to put a scene that would only return in the fourteenth episode, [...] "The Variable". The time flashes were designed in a way that demonstrated both the castaways at the beach and John Locke in the jungle were [...] "skipping" [...] to the same time periods, and also to show that time travel was painful for the characters.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{with a few}} detractors. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book, Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, calling the script [...] "very stylish". The two noted that [...] " [...] Duchovny is very good here [...] and, as a counterbalance, [...] Anderson provides some great comic relief." [...] Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode was [...] "a little too ponderously paced to be a classic episode, but it's clever and well crafted [...] a rewarding stand-out." [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "Cawing birds, spirit portals and split personalities are {{the order of the}} day in a story that doesn't offer that much in genuine thrills, but the best moments are Scully's occasional complaints from the field." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Despite noting that the episode [...] "gets off to an awkward start", Vitaris concluded that [...] "'Chimera' takes us into the heart of a quintessential X-Files family". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+", noting that, while the episode was good, it [...] "falls short of classic status, trying to make a metaphor into flesh, and not quite succeeding." [...] Although Handlen enjoyed the way the episode explores and then connects the main characters, his main critique was that Ellen's transformation is never explicitly explained. He explained that, [...] "If we had a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>where</b> her need comes from, if there was some hint at what drove her to this point, it would work; as is, the actress’s performance is excellent, but the character remains too generic." ...|$|E

Meanwhile, all sorts of warnings were going off, both because the plane thought that the instrument readings were consistent with various emergencies and because the crew's actions, based on false data, were creating problems. The pilot communicated with the air traffic controller, who kept telling them that they were at 9,700 feet. Actually, they were flying dangerously low, as indicated by the repeated [...] "Too low.
