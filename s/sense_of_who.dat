25|$|Understanding {{consumer}} {{personality and}} how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of {{the harmful effects of}} binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> they are were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person’s close friends.|$|E
25|$|Because {{healing is}} Ultima's mission, Antonio's {{relationship}} with her includes accompanying her to gather the curative herbs she knows about through tradition and spiritual revelation. With her Antonio visits the sick and begins to grasp a connection between healing and nature even though he never receives an explicit scientific or grounded explanation for how she foretells future occurrences, heals the infirm, combats witches through casting spells, or when and why she decides not to intervene. Ultima's indigenous and experiential pedagogy allows Antonio to intuit that her approach to healing includes a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> the afflicted person is, what s/he believes, knowledge of the healing powers of her herbs, {{and the limits of}} her power. He learns through assisting Ultima in the cure of his uncle that healing requires making himself vulnerable to sickness and to the spiritual as well as physical needs of the sick. With Antonio, Ultima's relationship as healer is also one of teacher. Cynthia Park considers the relationship between those two roles, and abstracts a set of life-giving principles that form the basis for Ultima's way of knowing.|$|E

500|$|Erin Aubry Kaplan of the Los Angeles Times noted, [...] "too often, [...] can't {{resist the}} temptation of irony, and his big ideas are {{sometimes}} overwhelmed by one wink-wink or metaphor too many." [...] Kirkus Reviews praised the book, writing, [...] "while making no attempt at depth of characterization, Whitehead audaciously blurs the line between social realism and fabulist satire." [...] The Library Journal praised the book, noting, [...] "in spare and evocative prose, Whitehead does Shakespeare one better: What's in a name, and how does our identity relate to our own <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> we are?" [...] The New York Observer was critical of the book but noted, [...] "readers not looking for direct emotional access to the characters may find it gratifying to solve the intellectual puzzle set here by Colson Whitehead." ...|$|E
500|$|Evan Ross Katz from Mic {{described}} the video as a [...] "highly spiritual journey" [...] {{like some of}} the singer's previous clips.

Bustles Shannon Carlin felt that the [...] "emotional" [...] video [...] "will make fans and non-fans look at [...] differently". Carlin compared it to the video of singer Christina Aguilera's 2002 single [...] "Beautiful", which had similar emotional and empowerment visuals, and finally added: [...] "Like Aguilera, Gaga is giving you a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> she is by stripping back all that pomp and circumstance of her early years and giving fans something raw." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} to Our World was overall very favorable. Reviews of the premiere episode, however, were somewhat tepid, with The New York Times saying [...] "There are worse ways {{to spend an}} hour" [...] and calling the show [...] "a pleasant hour", while pointing to segments such as an interview with [...] "a man, who, 17 years ago, slept in {{the house next door}} to a house struck by the Manson gang", as [...] "not terribly interesting." [...] The Los Angeles Times was harsher, calling the debut [...] "rather bland". While praising anchors Ellerbee and Gandolf, calling them [...] "refreshing [...] off-center, running against the TV mainstream, making words, not whoopee", the Times ultimately felt that [...] "Our World offers no <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> we really were in 1969 because, typical of TV, it renders everything equal." ...|$|E

The top notes include citrus, peach, and passion fruit chord; the heart notes give a [...] "spicy freshness" [...] through the use of various flowers like gardenia and sambac jasmine, and cinnamon; the base notes consist of amber, musk, sandalwood and vanilla chord. The fragrance is meant to be used by women, and Shakira claimed that [...] "The type of women who feel a connection with this fragrance would be independent and strong, but also a woman with a great capacity to love and a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> they are.

500|$|St. John was {{instructed}} by the show's directors to watch about fifteen episodes of Howarth's performances of Todd {{because they wanted}} him to portray Todd like Howarth did. St. John reported that he watched two episodes, but never tried to mimic Howarth's style because he felt that it was limiting, uncreative, and destructive. He said, [...] "I needed to get a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> Todd was first, and that has to happen organically." [...] He did not care if Marlon Brando portrayed the role before him, and said that even actors who portray Hamlet do it differently, adding, [...] "I don't care what the other guy did. That's his time." [...] St. John felt that it was up to him to decide how to perform Todd.

5000|$|Similarly, Joe Morgenstern {{wrote in}} The Wall Street Journal {{that the film}} {{consisted}} of battle scenes which were as [...] "notable for their clarity as their intensity; we can follow the strategies, get a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>who's</b> losing and who's winning.

500|$|According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's poetry can {{be placed}} within the African-American oral tradition, and her prose [...] "follows classic {{technique}} in nonpoetic Western forms". [...] O'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a [...] "monolithic black language", and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale calls a [...] "more expected ghetto expressiveness". [...] McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation {{between her and her}} audience. [...] As McWhorter states, [...] "I have never read autobiographical writing where I had such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> the subject really is". [...] McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou's books, like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak as one would expect, and that their speech is [...] "cleaned up" [...] for her readers. [...] Guy, for example, represents the young black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou's text, is intended to prove that blacks can use standard English competently.|$|E
500|$|Raize {{auditioned for}} the role of Adult Simba after hearing that Taymor was looking to cast an actor who was of [...] "unidentifiable ethnicity." [...] Raize {{revealed}} in an interview {{that there was a lot}} of competition {{for the role}} because the musical required [...] "triple-threat work -- singing, dancing and acting -- that you don't get to such an extent in other shows. [...] It was more the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> can take the challenge and not be daunted by the task." [...] Raize, who instantly felt that he [...] "had a connection with Simba," [...] eventually won the role with the approval of Taymor and choreographer Garth Fagan, with Fagan admiring the fact that Raize was [...] "willing to try, to fail, and then to try again." [...] Once cast, Raize found it difficult to maintain Taymor's [...] "sense of duality" [...] because Simba is [...] "both man and beast." [...] He said, [...] "The tendency is to sacrifice one for the other, but you can't." [...] Although hundreds of children auditioned {{for the role of}} Young Simba, the casting process was far less grueling for Irby-Ranniar who, according to Taymor, simply [...] "walked in and he had the part." ...|$|E
500|$|Newsarama's Richard Gray gave Justice League #22 an 8 out of 10. Gray {{stated that}} [...] "Johns does {{a terrific job}} of pulling {{together}} what has been essentially four or five separate stories, incorporating not only the three main titles that this will span over the coming months, but introducing several new players into the mix as well." [...] He also praised that the story advanced and showed similar promise that the reboot to the New 52 did in 2011. Joshua Yehl of IGN gave {{the first chapter of}} the Trinity War a 7.8 out of 10. He felt the issue {{set the stage for the}} event and praised the character work. However, he though that the conflict was not presented clearly yet and criticized the lack of the Justice League Dark in the first issue. Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, saying [...] "Johns manages to balance personality expositions with story breaks, giving readers a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> the opposing sides are, if nothing else. Johns brings lots of big moments to the pages, but the emotions he wrings from those moments really help sell this book." [...] Zawisza was surprised by the amount of time that was spent on Madame Xanadu, feeling as though it was only there for reason to include the Justice League Dark, and was wary that the characters are in danger of being absorbed by the plot. All three praised the art in the issue, especially Ivan Reis' pencils.|$|E

2500|$|Theron Martin of Anime News Network {{labelled}} the [...] "Hestia Factor" [...] {{as one of}} {{the reasons}} for DanMachis success, citing Inori Minase's voice acting, character development, as well as relationship with Bell.

[...] iDigitalTimes, in a review of the DanMachi anime, found the relationship between Bell and Hestia to be [...] "really touching", writing [...] "she obviously loves him and wants to be with him, not simply as patron goddess but as a lover.

2500|$|Cancer {{specialist}} Dr. Lawrence Piro was treating Fawcett in L.A. He and Fawcett's friend—Angels co-star Kate Jackson, {{a breast}} cancer survivor—appeared together on The Today Show. They dispelled tabloid-fueled rumors, including suggestions that Fawcett had {{ever been in a}} coma, had ever reached 86 pounds, and had ever given up her fight against the disease or lost the will to live. Jackson decried such fabrications, saying they [...] "really do hurt a human being and a person like Farrah." [...] Piro recalled when it became necessary for Fawcett to undergo treatments that would cause her to lose her hair, acknowledging [...] "Farrah probably has the most famous hair in the world", but also {{that it is not a}} trivial matter for any cancer patient, whose hair [...] "affects [...] whole <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> [...] are". Of the documentary, Jackson averred Fawcett [...] "didn't do this to show that 'she' is unique, she did it to show that we are all unique...

In the past Prue and Curtis shared an interest in drawing superhero fan art, but Prue has moved on to botanical illustration, leaving Curtis and his love of comic books behind. He is an awkward [...] "persecuted loner" [...] who lacks Prue's confidence, and is, at first, easily intimidated and manipulated by Prue, Alexandra, and others.

Later, by free choice, he becomes a full member of the bandits, and decides to stay behind with them in Wildwood, even as Prue returns home to St. Johns. Like Prue, Curtis is a [...] "half-breed" [...] who has a dual nature that allows him to enter The Wood, but the exact nature of this connection not revealed in Wildwood, other than Curtis speculating that he has a strange reclusive aunt, and a number of odd relatives.|$|E
