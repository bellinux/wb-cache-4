Brian's girlfriend, Nell Stapleton, tells Rebus that Brian had a 'Black Book', a small notebook in which he kept interesting snippets of information. She suggests that Brian was attacked because of <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> She also feels guilty, since she had argued with Brian just {{before he went to}} the restaurant.|$|E
500|$|After a courtship, Gillis and White {{got married}} on September 21, 1996; {{contrary}} to convention, {{he took his}} wife's surname. Shortly after, Goober and the Peas broke up, but Jack continued to play in other bands, such as the garage punk band The Go (he played lead guitar on their 1999 album Whatcha Doin'), The Hentchmen, and Two-Star Tabernacle. In 1997—allegedly on Bastille Day—Meg first began {{to learn to play}} the drums. In Jack's words, [...] "When she started to play drums with me, just on a lark, it felt liberating and refreshing. There was <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> that opened me up." [...] The couple then became a band and, while they considered calling themselves [...] "Bazooka" [...] and [...] "Soda Powder", they settled on the name [...] "The White Stripes". Jack explained the band name's origin this way: ...|$|E
500|$|Herren {{described}} the album {{as an attempt}} to bridge hip hop instrumentals with vocal-orientated hip hop tracks, saying that the chopped and edited raps were [...] "another layer of music" [...] and that he was [...] "into creating a whole new mangled language [...] it's a form of communication without communicating, a new flow when you feel like you're listening to a standard hip hop track but there's <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> that's not right." [...] The cut-up vocals were also described by Herren as a tribute to Miami bass music and the group Mantronix. Herren said: [...] "Old school dirty south and booty shake shit, just the way stuff was edited back then, all the bass music and edit records... that's what inspired me. I wanted to make edit records, but bring all the shit that happened afterwards into it, hip hop from the early 90s through the present day." [...] The song [...] "Nuno" [...] features chopped-up vocals with only the phrase [...] "fuck words of wisdom" [...] intelligible; the title is a reference to the Portuguese musician Nuno Canavarro, whose 1988 album Plux Quba also features manipulated vocals including randomly-reassembled tapes of children singing. Herren used a sample from Canavarro's song [...] "Wask" [...] for [...] "Nuno".|$|E

I {{think a lot of people}} affect to despise his archaic value system while suspecting that there's <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> and would say so if only more influential people would stick their head above the parapet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The dust in Gusev Crater is {{the same}} as dust all around the planet. All the dust was found to be magnetic. Moreover, Spirit found the {{magnetism}} was caused by the mineral magnetite, especially magnetite that contained the element titanium. One magnet was able to completely divert all dust hence all Martian dust is thought to be magnetic. [...] The spectra of the dust was similar to spectra of bright, low thermal inertia regions like Tharsis and Arabia that have been detected by orbiting satellites. A thin layer of dust, maybe less than one millimeter thick covers all surfaces. <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> contains a small amount of chemically bound water.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Burke did not {{condemn the}} French Revolution. In {{a letter of}} 9 August 1789, he wrote: [...] "England gazing with astonishment at a French {{struggle}} for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I thought I saw something like it in progress for several years, has still <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> paradoxical and Mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner". The events of 5–6 October 1789, when a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles to compel King Louis XVI to return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In {{a letter to his}} son, Richard Burke, dated 10 October he said: [...] "This day I heard from Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France—where the Elements which compose Human Society seem all to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it—where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable". On 4 November Charles-Jean-François Depont wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution. Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken [...] "as no more than the expression of doubt" [...] but he added: [...] "You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover'd freedom". In the same month he described France as [...] "a country undone". Burke's first public condemnation of the Revolution occurred on the debate in Parliament on the army estimates on 9 February 1790, provoked by praise of the Revolution by Pitt and Fox: ...|$|E
