500|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} on Lee and LeFevre's On the Road to Freedom album in November 1973, and as the A-side of a single the following month. The album was critically well received, and Billboard included [...] "So Sad" [...] among its recommended singles for the week of 22 December 1973. Writing in Rolling Stone, Bud Scoppa paired the track with the Wood-composed [...] "Let 'Em Say What They Will" [...] as [...] "two non-originals [...] are beauties", adding: [...] "George Harrison's 'So Sad (No Love of His Own)' <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like {{one of his best}} songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Hetfield {{stated that}} the album was written with [...] "a lot of passion". He said, [...] "There's two years of {{condensed}} emotion in this. We've gone {{through a lot of}} personal changes, struggles, epiphanies, it's deep. It's so deep lyrically and musically. [...] is just the best that it can be from us right now." [...] The band purposely wanted a raw sound on the album so that Rock did not polish the sound while mixing. The band desired the raw sound because of the depth of the emotion they felt {{and did not want to}} [...] "mess with it". Rock commented, [...] "I wanted to do something to shake up radio and the way everything else <b>sounds.</b> <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> this album sounds like four guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs. There was really no time to get amazing performances out of James. We liked the raw performances. And we didn't do what everyone does and what I've been guilty of for a long time, which is tuning vocals. We just did it, boom, and that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|Roddenberry said of Christianity, [...] "How can I {{take seriously}} a God-image that {{requires}} that I prostrate myself every seven days and praise it? That <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{like a very}} insecure personality." [...] At one point, he worked a similar opinion, which {{was to have been}} stated by a Vulcan, into the plot for Star Trek: The God Thing. Before his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher Charles Musès, who said that Roddenberry's views were [...] "a far cry from atheism". Roddenberry explained his position thusly: [...] "It's not true that I don't believe in God. I believe in a kind of God. It's just not other people's God. I reject religion. I accept the notion of God." [...] He had an ongoing interest in other people's experiences with religion, and called Catholicism [...] "a very beautiful religion. An art form." [...] However, he said that he dismissed all organized religions, saying that for the most part, they acted like a [...] "substitute brain... and a very malfunctioning one". Roddenberry was also critical of how the public looked at certain religions, noting that when the King David Hotel bombing took place in 1946, the American public accepted it as the action of freedom fighters, whereas a car bombing by a Muslim in Beirut is condemned as a terrorist act. While he agreed that both parties were wrong in their use of violence, he said that the actions of both were undertaken because of their strong religious beliefs.|$|E
60|$|I {{was puzzled}} and angry. What he said made sense somehow, but it <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{like so much}} gibberish.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{like the}} tones of an oracle--the whisperings of fancy--the very words of truth! It {{was a strange}} and persuasive voice!" ...|$|R
60|$|Shots awoke me, I think, distant shots. And {{they sounded}} like the ripping and tearing of cloth for a wound. 'Twas no new <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
500|$|... "For June Bolan, {{the alarm}} bells began to sound only when Syd kept his girlfriend under {{lock and key}} for three days, {{occasionally}} shoving a ration of biscuits under the door." [...] A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic Jonathan Meades. [...] "I went [...] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like heating pipes shaking. I said, 'What's up?' and he sort of giggled and said, 'That's Syd having a bad trip. We put him in the linen cupboard'". Storm Thorgerson responded to this claim by stating [...] "I do not remember locking Syd up in a cupboard. It <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like pure fantasy, like Jonathan Meades was on dope himself." [...] Other friends assert that Barrett's infamous flatmates, [...] "Mad Jock" [...] and [...] "Mad Sue," [...] believed that acid held all the answers and thought of Barrett as a genius or [...] "god," [...] and were spiking his morning coffee with LSD every day without his knowledge, leaving him in a never-ending trip. He was later rescued from that flat by friends and moved elsewhere, but his erratic behavior continued. Watkinson and Anderson included quotes from a story told to them by Thorgerson that underscored how volatile Barrett could be. [...] "On one occasion, I had to pull him off Lindsay (Barrett's girlfriend at the time) because he was beating her over the head with a mandolin". On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour's house. These strange behaviors contradicted Barrett's usually gentle nature. According to Gilmour in an interview with Nick Kent, the other members of Pink Floyd approached psychiatrist R. D. Laing with the 'Barrett problem'. After hearing a tape of a Barrett conversation, Laing declared him [...] "incurable".|$|E
2500|$|One {{composer}} Culshaw {{had nothing}} to do with was Mahler. He had a strong aversion to Mahler's music, writing that it made him feel sick: [...] "not metaphorically but physically sick. I find his strainings and heavings, juxtaposed with what always <b>sounds</b> (<b>to</b> <b>me)</b> like faux-naif music of the most calculated type, downright repulsive".|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, Swedish actor Lars Ekborg, outside Sweden most {{known for}} his part in Ingmar Bergman's [...] "Summer with Monika" [...] made an album called [...] "I Tom Lehrers vackra värld" [...] ("In the {{beautiful}} world of Tom Lehrer"), with 12 of Lehrer's songs interpreted in Swedish. Lehrer {{wrote in a letter to}} the producer Per–Anders Boquist that [...] "not knowing any Swedish, I am obviously not equipped to judge, but it <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as though Mr Ekborg is perfect for the songs", along with further compliments to pianist Leif Asp for unexpected additional flourishes.|$|E
60|$|Mr Abney did not rebuke the {{strength}} of his language. Probably the theory struck him as eminently <b>sound.</b> <b>To</b> <b>me</b> there certainly seemed something in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you minded to stop here, lad?" [...] I {{asked in}} a low tone, and he replied with what <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> much like an odd {{inflection}} of the voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't {{say that}} I know exactly," [...] the latter answered, [...] "but I guess we'll {{find out where}} that cry came from. <b>Sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> uncommonly like a human effort." ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{was quite}} {{intensely}} religious, {{because even though}} he uses the word Providence, he constantly sees Providence as an active force in life, particularly in American life. [...] I mean, every single victory in war he credits to Providence. [...] The miracle of the Constitutional Convention he credits to Providence. [...] The creation {{of the federal government}} and the prosperity of the early republic, he credits to Providence... I was struck at how frequently in his letters he's referring to Providence, and it's Providence where there's a sense of design and purpose, which <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> very much like religion... Unfortunately, this particular issue has become very very politicized.|$|E
2500|$|On “Can You Learn,” {{which was}} {{originally}} {{going to be}} the title-track, T.I. and R. Kelly talk to the ladies from a different perspective: [...] "This record <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like what you would expect to hear if Tupac collaborated with Nate Dogg,” said T.I. of the DJ Montay-produced track, which was inspired by his own leading lady, Tameka [...] "Tiny" [...] Cottle. [...] "I really feel the connection between the music and the listener, especially if the listener is a lady or a gentleman who has had a lady who stuck by him through all of the ups and downs, the peaks and valleys that life has to offer. She’s proven herself to be a rider." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quinn’s {{argument}} against the obscenity charges was based upon claims that the prurient material in Ulysses was actually a deterrent rather than a pernicious influence. He made further arguments that one needed {{to be acquainted with}} the city of Dublin to truly understand the work and that the sporadic punctuation, and the perceived incomprehensibility of the novel, was due to Joyce’s poor eyesight. At one point in the trial Quinn confessed that [...] "I myself do not understand Ulysses—I think Joyce has carried his method too far,” whereupon one of the presiding judges replied, “Yes, it <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like the ravings of a disordered mind—I can’t see why anyone would want to publish it".|$|E
5000|$|Malladi {{currently}} {{resides in}} Denmark {{with her husband}} and two sons. She has said that [...] "When I first moved <b>to</b> Denmark... Danish <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like the buzzing of bees".|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you could}} sleep," [...] said Sarah, [...] "you were more {{fortunate}} than Frances and myself; every murmur {{of the night}} air <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like {{the approach of the}} rebel army." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's right---quite {{right to}} keep up before her. It does not <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so bad, after all; perhaps they will {{telegraph}} again to stop her. Did Claude ask her to come out?' ...|$|R
2500|$|New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said, [...] "it <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like {{excessive}} force was used," [...] {{and called the}} shooting [...] "inexplicable" [...] and [...] "unacceptable". Ex-New York State governor George E. Pataki also stated that he thought the shooting was excessive. NYC police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, has put the five officers involved on paid administrative leave and stripped them of their weapons, a move the New York Times called [...] "forceful". [...] He told the Times that the officers were stripped of their guns because [...] "there were, and are, too many unanswered questions". Both Bloomberg and Kelly have {{also noted that the}} shooting was possibly in violation of department guidelines prohibiting shooting at a moving vehicle, even if the vehicle is being used as a weapon. [...] The Public Advocate extended condolences to Bell's former fiancée and family following the killing.|$|E
2500|$|Speculation has {{sometimes}} focused on Rosario, Hedgepeth's roommate at the time, {{due to her}} 9-1-1 call, the last texts sent from Hedgepeth's phone to her former boyfriend suggesting [...] " [...] needs you more than you know", the woman addressed as [...] "Rosie" [...] on the voicemail conversation and her decision to leave the apartment unlocked with, she claims, a sleeping Hedgepeth inside, to go sleep somewhere else at 4:30 {{the morning of the}} killing. Although she has left North Carolina and said very little about the case since then, Gasparoli wrote in 2017 that he learned from his police sources that they still regularly speak with her, and she cooperates. [...] "They do believe there is more Rosario can tell them," [...] he says. [...] " [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like [...] has been in the crosshairs ... as a key figure who knows more than she says she knows." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Spooner, the farmer, said on CNN that Sherrod {{is not a}} racist, {{that she}} did {{everything}} she could for his family; more than 20 years later, he and Sherrod remain friends. [...] The Spooners credit Sherrod with helping them save their farm: [...] "If it hadn't been for her, we would've never known who to see or what to do", Roger Spooner said. [...] "She led us right to our success." [...] His wife, Eloise Spooner, said that [...] "after things kind of settled down, she brought Sherrod some tomatoes out of her garden, {{and they had a}} good visit." [...] Eloise Spooner recalled Sherrod as [...] "nice-mannered, thoughtful, friendly; a good person." [...] The couple were surprised by the controversy. [...] "I don't know what brought up the racist mess", Roger Spooner said. [...] "They just want to stir up some trouble, it <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in my opinion." [...] Eloise Spooner said that on seeing the story of Sherrod's resignation, [...] "I said, 'That ain't right. They have not treated her right.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Aye, aye, I'll listen,' {{returned}} the old man, still {{without looking at}} her; 'a pretty voice. It has always a sweet <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It always had when it was her mother's, poor child.' ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a very disagreeable speech; but {{the grey}} man laughed--I {{had not heard}} him laugh till then--and my mother ran to my aunt and kissed her; and somehow the room seemed to become lighter.|$|R
60|$|House of mine, in your walls, strong {{sounds the}} sea, Of all sounds on earth, dearest <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I {{have heard the}} applause of men, I have heard it arise and die: Sweeter now in my house I hear the trade-wind cry.|$|R

60|$|I confess I {{doubt the}} Homeric genuineness of [Greek: dakruoen gelaschsa]. [1] It <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{much more like}} a prettiness of Bion or Moschus.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{ranch in}} Texas," [...] sighed Aunt Ellen. [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{more like a}} {{liability}} than an asset. Those are {{the places where the}} centipedes are found, and cowboys, and fandangos." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The name of Anne Elliot," [...] said he, [...] "has {{long had}} an {{interesting}} <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{had never}} thought much of my name before; but when she spoke it, it <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{for the first time}} in my life like a mighty nice name, and then she brightened {{suddenly}} and tapped her own breast and said: [...] "Ajor!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Locker, [...] "it <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as if he}} were calculating {{his last}} week's expenses. But when he gets to French cursing, I drop him. I can't fight him that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear, I {{know you}} have many to care for, {{and it is hard}} to strike the balance; but somehow your voice <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if Geraldine were the one you most willingly set aside.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Kate stoutly confronted him. [...] "Perhaps {{the fame}} {{you give her}} will destroy her. It <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like notoriety rather than fame. This poor child {{has a right to}} herself, and I will help her assert it." ...|$|E
