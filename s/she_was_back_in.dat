5|$|Yellow Fever and How to Cure It was {{a three-part}} story by Robert Holmes {{that would have}} taken place in Singapore and {{featured}} the Autons as the monsters, with both the Rani and the Master appearing, the Brigadier would have also returned. The first episode was commissioned on 26 October 1984, before being put on hold. The entire story was subsequently commissioned on 6 February 1985, only {{a couple of weeks before}} news of the planned hiatus broke. Nathan-Turner hoped to have Graeme Harper direct the adventure. After the news of the hiatus, Holmes was asked by the production team to continue with the story but as six 25 minute episodes, this version seeing the removal of the Master from the plot. Holmes reportedly only completed a story outline before the planned Season 23 was completely cancelled. The basic premise had the Master and the Rani operating under the guise of a travelling street theatre, the story would open with Peri seeing the Statue of Liberty on the scanner screen, and she would think <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> America, only to find they were in a massive cultural garden with many miniature landmarks on display.|$|E
