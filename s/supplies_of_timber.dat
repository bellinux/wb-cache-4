5|$|After {{the failure}} of the initial assault, a meeting between the various leaders was {{organized}} in which it was agreed upon that a more concerted attack would be required in the future. On 17 June, a party of Genoese mariners under Guglielmo Embriaco arrived at Jaffa, and provided the Crusaders with skilled engineers, and perhaps more critically, <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> (stripped from the ships) to build siege engines. The Crusaders' morale was raised when a priest, Peter Desiderius, claimed to have had a divine vision, of Bishop Adhemar, instructing them to fast and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the Biblical story of Joshua at the siege of Jericho. After a three-day fast, on 8 July the crusaders performed the procession as they had been instructed by Desiderius, ending on the Mount of Olives where Peter the Hermit preached to them, and shortly afterward the various bickering factions arrived at a public rapprochement. News arrived shortly after that a Fatimid relief army had set off from Egypt, giving the Crusaders a very strong incentive to make another assault on the city.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the behaviour, performance, and impact <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> price, forest management and of deforestation on the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> tropical <b>timbers</b> in the Amazon Region. As a methodological basis, it has used regression analysis to estimate the supply equation and the substitution elasticity model to verify competitiveness between the two sources <b>of</b> tropical <b>timbers.</b> The results suggest that the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> tropical <b>timbers</b> in the domestic market is inelastic, in which deforestation and timber prices have significantly influenced the quantities supplied in the period under study. The production originated from managed forest areas does not yet contribute significantly to the global <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>timber.</b> The work further reveals that the substitution elasticity between the distinct sources <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> is significant and positive. This demonstrates that sustainable forest management competes with deforestation in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> tropical <b>timbers...</b>|$|R

500|$|When Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, the interregnum army was demobilised; a guard-force remained in Hull to protect the arsenal there, being officially {{referred to as the}} [...] "Hull Blockhouse" [...] garrison. All three sites were garrisoned: surveys reported that the South Blockhouse was in a good condition and held 21 guns, the castle was in a poor condition and held only 8 light guns, and the North Blockhouse was in a [...] "ruinous" [...] condition and held 10 guns. An order was taken to strip the most ruined parts of the North Blockhouse of its timber, bricks and lead to help improve the remainder, supplemented by additional <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> and bricks donated by the Crown, but the material was misappropriated and used, in part, for construction work on the houses of the Governor and his deputy.|$|E

40|$|Timber is an {{important}} commodity in African towns. This paper reports the findings from research into the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> to Dar es Salaam and Mwanza (Tanzania). Tanzania has reserves <b>of</b> hardwood <b>timber</b> in the natural forest and softwood timber in plantations. Information gathered from consumers, producers and traders was used to estimate consumption, analyse changing patterns <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and assess sustainability. Analysis <b>of</b> the hardwood <b>supply</b> system (presented as a sub-sector diagram) {{found it to be}} ‘slippery’, evolving in response to diminishing resources and a cumbersome and ineffective regulatory regime. With the advent of pit-sawing and other changes, control over the cutting <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> in the natural forest has been lost. Regaining control is unlikely unless effective local community participation can be established. Sustainable management in the plantations is achievable and offers the best chance <b>of</b> ensuring a <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> to meet future demands...|$|R

50|$|The British {{timber trade}} was {{importation}} of timber from the Baltic, and later North America, by the British. During the Middle Ages and Stuart period, Great Britain had large domestic <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>timber,</b> especially valuable were the famous British oaks.

The glass works primarily made lead-based glass, and was known for its use of color. Jarves received several patents for his improvements in glass mold designs and pressing techniques. The factory declined after the Civil War due to competition from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia companies that produced less expensive pressed soda-lime glass tableware.|$|E

5000|$|The first European {{settlement}} of the peninsula was [...] in the early 1830s. It was selected as a penal settlement because it was geographically isolated {{from the rest of}} the colony but more easily reachable by sea than the other place of secondary banishment, Macquarie Harbour on the west coast, which could then be closed down. It also had excellent <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> for shipbuilding and general construction work, and a deep sheltered harbour where visiting British warships could be repaired. Its inaccessibility was enhanced by having Eaglehawk Neck lined with guards and guard dogs, to prevent the escape of any convicts. A small number did escape, including the bushranger Martin Cash.|$|E
50|$|On October 20, 1761, {{the town}} of Neshobe was {{chartered}} to Capt. Josiah Powers. In October 1784, {{the name of the}} town was changed to Brandon by an act of legislature. Brandon is a study in early American architecture and Vermont history. When the first settlers came to the area in the mid-1770s, they established the village of Neshobe. The area was rich in natural resources with excellent farmland along the rivers and abundant <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> and minerals. The town flourished during the 1800s with several industries relying on the key resources of waterpower, iron ore and marble. The coming of the railroad in 1849 enabled the manufacture and shipping of iron-based products such as the Howe scale, as well as Brandon paints, wood products and marble.|$|E

One of these, the Gibraltar, of 80 guns, captured by Lord Rodney off Cape St. Vincent was broken up in the royal dock yard at Pembroke, and though {{she must have been}} one of the oldest ships afloat, yet all her timbers were so sound as when they were put into her, and the whole British navy, and if I (Capt. Chaffell, secretary of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company) am not mistaken, are now supplied with tables made out of the Gibraltar timbers. The Gibraltar was captured in 1780 and was finally broken up in 1836." ...|$|E
50|$|OCMA is {{currently}} excavating shipwreck 43, one of 67 ancient ships so-far recorded by IEASM under Franck Goddio. Tentatively dated to between 785-481 cal BC, the vessel has a distinctive form of naval architecture {{that has not}} been fully documented elsewhere in the ancient Mediterranean. This involved the use of long tenons that were initially fitted into mortice holes that passed through the keel plank over which multiple lines of planking were added, pegged into place with wooden treenails. From the albeit limited excavations, there {{do not appear to be}} any frames and consequently the long tenons may have provided the structural stability of the vessel through a kind of ‘internal framework’. As the structural elements of the wreck were made from the locally-available wood Acacia Totilis/Radiana, it is thought that shipwreck 43 was Egyptian in origin and thus probably involves a shipbuilding tradition that developed in accordance with the availability of local <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> and the realities of nautical life at the margins of the Nile Delta.|$|E
