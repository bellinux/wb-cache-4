5|$|The {{recognition}} by Russia was condemned by the United States, France, the {{secretary-general of the}} Council of Europe, {{the president of the}} Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the OSCE chairman, NATO and the G7 {{on the grounds that it}} violated Georgia's territorial integrity, United Nations <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>resolutions</b> and the ceasefire agreement. In response to Russia's action, the Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia.|$|E
5|$|The UN {{has also}} drawn {{criticism}} for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>resolutions.</b> Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention {{are seen as}} having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in 1971, the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s, and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete the peacekeeping operations in 1992–93 during the Somali Civil War. UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan and what is now South Sudan, Burundi, and Ivory Coast. Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of the mainland Turkish military in Cyprus is highly controversial, having been denounced as an occupation force by the Republic of Cyprus and the international community. Several United Nations <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>resolutions</b> have called on the Turkish forces to withdraw.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, Bush Administration {{officials}} advanced a parallel legal argument using the earlier resolutions, which authorized force {{in response to}} Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Under this reasoning, by failing to disarm and submit to weapons inspections, Iraq was in violation of U.N. <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>Resolutions</b> 660 and 678, and the U.S. could legally compel Iraq's compliance through military means.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{to reach}} a {{solution}} to the Cyprus dispute have been unsuccessful. The Turkish Army maintains a large force in Northern Cyprus. While its presence is supported and approved by the TRNC government, the Republic of Cyprus and the international community regard it as an occupation force, and its presence has been denounced in several United Nations <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>resolutions.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{a variety}} of {{articles}} and interviews, Hitchens asserted that British intelligence was correct in claiming that Saddam had attempted to buy uranium from Niger, and that US envoy Joseph Wilson had been dishonest in his public denials of it.

25|$|Iraq {{remains the}} most {{significant}} near-term threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf region. This is primarily due to its large conventional military force, pursuit of WMD, oppressive treatment of Iraqi citizens, refusal to comply with United Nations <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>resolutions</b> (UNSCR), persistent threats to enforcement of the no-fly zones (NFZ), and continued efforts to violate UN Security Council sanctions through oil smuggling.|$|E
25|$|During {{and after}} the Dutch Golden Age, the Dutch people built up a {{commercial}} and colonial empire. The most important colonies were present-day Suriname and Indonesia. Indonesia became independent after the Indonesian National Revolution in the 1940s following a war of independence, international pressure and several United Nations <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>resolutions.</b> Suriname became independent in 1975. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands.

25|$|The US {{government}} {{presents the}} case differently.

The government concluded that Omar was part of Zarqawi's network and that he facilitated terrorist activities both in and outside of Iraq. Four Jordanian foreign fighters and an Iraqi insurgent were captured along with Omar, and weapons and improvised explosive device (IED)-making materials were found in Omar's home.|$|E

25|$|Nepal {{is one of}} the few Asian {{countries}} to have consistently supported Israel at international forums and at the UN. Nepal has maintained diplomatic relations and continues to support the right of Israel to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries. Nepal voted in favour of <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>Resolutions</b> 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which upheld the right of all the states in the region to live in peace.

The Quartet has reiterated that the only viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement that ends the occupation that began in 1967; resolves all permanent status issues as previously defined by the parties; and fulfils the aspirations of both parties for independent homelands through two states for two peoples, Israel and an independent, contiguous and viable state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Orakhelashvili {{says that}} the Security Council manifestly lacks the {{competence}} to validate agreements imposed through coercion, not least because the peremptory prohibition {{of the use of}} force is a limitation on the Council’s powers and the voidness of coercively imposed treaties is the clear consequence of jus cogens and the conventional law as reflected in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. A recent South African study concluded that the ultimate status and boundaries will require negotiation between the parties, according to <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>Resolutions</b> 242 and 338. The same study also found that the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention which govern ‘special agreements’ that can adversely affect the rights of protected persons precludes any change in status of the territory obtained through an agreement concluded during a state of belligerent occupation.|$|E
