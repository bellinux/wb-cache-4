The possibility to observe low-level auditory processes independently from the higher-level ones makes it possible to address long-standing theoretical issues such as whether or not humans possess a <b>specialized</b> <b>module</b> for perceiving speech or whether or not some complex acoustic invariance (see lack of invariance above) underlies the recognition of a speech sound.|$|E
5000|$|The motor {{theory of}} speech {{perception}} is {{the hypothesis that}} people perceive spoken words by identifying the vocal tract gestures {{with which they are}} pronounced rather than by identifying the sound patterns that speech generates. [...] It originally claimed that speech perception is done through a <b>specialized</b> <b>module</b> that is innate and human-specific. Though the idea of a module has been qualified in more recent versions of the theory, the idea remains that the role of the speech motor system is not only to produce speech articulations but also to detect them.|$|E
5000|$|Using {{a speech}} synthesizer, speech sounds can be varied {{in place of}} {{articulation}} along a continuum from [...] to [...] to , or in voice onset time on a continuum from [...] to [...] (for example). When listeners are asked to discriminate between two different sounds, they perceive sounds as belonging to discrete categories, even though the sounds vary continuously. In other words, 10 sounds (with the sound on one extreme being [...] and the sound on the other extreme being , and {{the ones in the}} middle varying on a scale) may all be acoustically different from one another, but the listener will hear all of them as either [...] or [...] Likewise, the English consonant [...] may vary in its acoustic details across different phonetic contexts (the /d/ in [...] does not technically sound the same as the one in , for example), but all 's as perceived by a listener fall within one category (voiced alveolar plosive) and that is because [...] "linguistic representations are abstract, canonical, phonetic segments or the gestures that underlie these segments." [...] This suggests that humans identify speech using categorical perception, and thus that a <b>specialized</b> <b>module,</b> such as that proposed by the motor theory of speech perception, may be on the right track.|$|E

Analysis of stimulus identity and location within the auditory scene remained intact. In addition, intracranial auditory evoked potentials, recorded preoperatively, revealed motion-specific responses selectively over the resected right posterior STG, and electrical cortical stimulation of this region was experienced by the patient as incoming moving sounds. Collectively, these data present a patient with cortical motion deafness, providing evidence that cortical processing of auditory motion is performed in a <b>specialized</b> <b>module</b> within the posterior STG...|$|E
