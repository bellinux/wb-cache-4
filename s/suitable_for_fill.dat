40|$|The {{monitoring}} of active volcanoes using automatic recording devices is particularly prone to data losses {{because of the}} inherent geological and environmental conditions encountered in situ. However, most analysis methods applied {{in the investigation of}} medium-to-long term volcano dynamics, e. g. statistical methods, require time series without gaps in the observations. An appropriate reconstruction of the missing data in the recorded time series is, therefore, essential. Classical interpolation methods are not <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> gaps in time series; their smoothing properties do not preserve the observed variability of the data. Furthermore, these methods of dominant polynomial nature can usually not be calibrated to the analysed observations. In response to these requirements, an approach based on geostatistical concepts is proposed that allows time series reconstruction by stochastic simulation with the following capabilities: (a) honouring temporal auto-correlation, (b) conservation of the observed variability and (c) conditioning of the data and of their histogram.

As {{the first line of}} defense for the corrosion protection of the stressing anchorage, a quality stressing pocket patch is essential for the long-term durability of the post-tensioning system. A premixed cementitious non-shrink grout described in the following and applied correctly to a well-prepared surface is required <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> single-strand tendon stressing pockets. A product best suited as a patch material is a high-quality premixed cementitious chloride-free non-shrink grout, mixed with limited amount of water per manufacturers’ recommendation for use as repair material. These repair grouts are designed specifically <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> concrete voids in vertical and overhead applications and are <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> single-strand stressing pockets. All major cementitious material suppliers have prepackaged non-shrink grouts. The key to a quality stressing pocket patch is the use of the right patch material, the recommended surface preparation, and the proper mixing and application. These repair grouts must be mixed, applied, and cured per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Stressing pockets should be free from all PT coating, grease, form release agents, dirt, loose concrete, debris, or any deleterious material. Although it is accepted practice to place a small amount of PT coating or grease on the tip of the pocket former that is inserted into the anchor wedge cavity (particularly with standard nonencapsulated anchorages), any portion of the pocket former that comes into contact with the surrounding concrete should be free from all PT coating, grease, and form release. The inside surface of the pocket former recess should be cleaned with a wire brush or similar to ensure the proper bond of the patch material; a bonding agent may be applied. The recess must be immediately protected with filling material. An inspection of the surface preparation and filling of the anchorage pockets is highly desirable...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} control heat input and reduce spatter {{generation}} and fumes, power sources {{have been developed}} {{with the ability to}} release one drop for a sequence of arc and pulsed time. The arc uses direct current (e.g. pulsed GMAW) or alternative current (e.g. AC-GMAW) with different current waveforms. A pulsed arc can be used in all welding positions and with all base material thicknesses in both manual and automatic welding systems. Out of position welding is also possible due to the lower than average current level. Because of the low heat input, this mode is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> gaps. It is widely used in the GMAW of aluminium (Kah et al. 2012). The method is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> welding all standard and high performance grades of stainless steel when nickel base or stainless steel filler metals are used.

Super austenitic stainless steel exhibits better mechanical and metallurgical properties with optimized parameters in GMA welding compare to conventional spray (Sathiya et al. 2012). Pulsed arc welding has applications in the shipbuilding industry, for example, out of position welding of high strength low alloy base materials in ship hull fabrication. The advantages of pulsed arc in shipbuilding are that its electrode efficiency is higher compared to flux-core arc welding (FCAW), and it can deliver lower hydrogen weld deposits (Lyttle and Praxair 1990; Knopp and Lorenz 2002; Althouse et al. 2004; Laren 2004; Ueyama et al. 2005; Lebedev 2010; Torbati et al. 2011; Kah et al. 2013).|$|R

The famous lost Inca city is an {{architectural}} remnant of a society whose understanding of civil and hydraulic engineering was both advanced and complete. At 8000 ft in the Andes Mountains, the city planners had to consider the steep slopes of the site as well as the 2,000 mm of rainfall per year. Making models out of clay before beginning to build, the city planners remained consistent with Inca architecture and laid out a city that separated the agriculture and urban areas. Before construction began the engineers had to assess the spring and whether it could provide for all of the city’s anticipated citizens. After evaluating the water supply, the civil engineers designed a 2457 ft-long canal to what would become the city’s center. The canal descends the mountain slope, enters the city walls, passes through the agricultural sector, then crosses the inner wall into the urban sector, where it feeds a series of fountains. The fountains are publicly accessible and partially enclosed by walls that are typically about 1.2 m high, except for the lowest fountain, which is a private fountain for the Temple of the Condor and has higher walls.

40|$|Background: Auto bone is {{the gold}} {{standard}} in bone grafting. However, the morbidity and additional surgical time associated with its collection, {{as well as the}} limited supply, have stimulated the search for substitutes. Allograft is more limited than autograft because it yields more variable clinical results. Composite synthetic grafts offer an alternative because Hydroxyapatite is chemically identical to the inorganic matrix of living bones and it can be processed synthetically. The intent was to evaluate these two graft materials for clinical use and to provide an insight on the different grafting strategies to enhance bone formation. Objective: To find out the bone healing process and the prognostic value for the patient using hydroxyapatite alloplastic material and allogenic bone graft. Method: Total 28 patients were included in the study after the clinical and radiological evaluation where 14 cases were treated with allogenic-bone graft and rest 14 cases were treated with hydroxyapatite alloplastic material after enucleation of the cystic lesion in random manner. The integration of hydroxyapatite and allogenic bone was assessed with postoperative lesion diameter, trabecular pattern, histopathological and scintigraphic examination of the successful graft cases. Statistical analysis was carried out by ‘unpaired T test' and ‘Chi square' test. Result: The radiological, histopathological and scintigraphical outcome of the patients treated with hydroxyaptite granule bone graft were clinically and statistically superior in comparison with those who were treated with allogenic bone graft.

40|$|The method here {{presented}} {{intends to}} minimize {{the effect of the}} gaps in the power spectra by gap-filling preserving the original information, that is, in the case of asteroseismology, the stellar oscillation frequency content. We make use of a forward-backward predictor based on autoregressive moving average modelling (ARMA) in the time domain. The method MIARMA is particularly <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> replacing invalid data such as those present in the light curves of the CoRoT satellite due to the pass through the South Atlantic Anomaly, and eventually for the data gathered by the NASA planet hunter Kepler. We select a sample of stars from the ultra-precise photometry collected by the asteroseismic camera on board the CoRoT satellite: the δ Scuti star HD 174966, showing periodic variations of the same order as the CoRoT observational window, the Be star HD 51193, showing longer time variations, and the solar-like HD 49933, with rapid time variations. We showed that in some cases linear interpolations are less reliable to what was believed. In particular: the power spectrum of HD 174966 is clearly aliased when this interpolation is used <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> the gaps; the light curve of HD 51193 presents a much more aliased spectrum than expected for a low frequency harmonic signal; and finally, although the linear interpolation does not affect noticeably the power spectrum of the CoRoT light curve of the solar-like star HD 49933, the ARMA interpolation showed rapid variations previously unidentified that ARMA interprets as a signal. In any case, the ARMA interpolation method provides a cleaner power spectrum, that is, less contaminated by spurious frequencies. In conclusion, MIARMA appears to be a <b>suitable</b> method <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> gaps in the light curves of pulsating stars observed by CoRoT since the method preserves their frequency content, which is a necessary condition for asteroseismic studies.

30|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} (CaP) based ceramic microspheres {{has become}} a common interest to researchers, particularly hydroxyapatite (HA) (Abou Neel et al. 2008, 2009 a; Abou Neel and Knowles 2008; Abou Neel et al. 2007, 2009 b; Ahmed et al. 2004 a, b), and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) (Akamatsu et al. 2010; Athanasiou et al. 1998; Auras et al. 2003; Baldwin et al. 2010; Bergquist et al. 1972; Berkland 2004) for their use in orthopaedics, dentistry and the pharmaceutical sectors due to their excellent biocompatibility, osteoconductivity and adequate mechanical properties. These materials tend to be used alone or in combination with different polymer phases. The advantages {{associated with the use}} of ceramic microspheres include implantation via a minimally invasive route and they can provide mechanical support to the target site of application. Despite these advantages, these ceramic materials are associated with high brittleness and slow resorption rates compared to glass microspheres. In addition, the spherical shape of ceramic particles are considered to be more <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> bone defect <b>filling</b> applications due to their packing and predictable flow characteristics during injection, compared to irregular shaped micro-particles (Bohner et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, the eddy {{covariance}} technique {{has been used for}} an increasing number of methane flux studies at an ecosystem scale. Previously, most of these studies used a closed path setup with a tunable diode laser spectrometer (TDL). Although this method worked well, the TDL has to be calibrated regularly and cooled with liquid nitrogen or a cryogenic system, which limits its use in remote areas. Recently, a new closed path technique has been introduced that uses off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy that does not require regular calibration or liquid nitrogen to operate and can thus be applied in remote areas. In the summer of 2008 and 2009, this eddy covariance technique was used to study methane fluxes from a tundra site in northeastern Siberia. The measured emissions showed to be very dependent on the fetch area, due to a large contrast in dry and wet vegetation in between wind directions. Furthermore, the observed short- and long-term variation of methane fluxes could be readily explained with a nonlinear model that used relationships with atmospheric stability, soil temperature, and water level. This model was subsequently extended to fieldwork periods preceding the eddy covariance setup and applied to evaluate a spatially integrated flux. The model result showed that average fluxes were 56. 5, 48. 7, and 30. 4 nmol CH 4 m- 2 s- 1 for the summers of 2007 to 2009. While previous models of the same type were only applicable to daily averages, the method described can be used on a much higher temporal resolution, making it <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> gap <b>filling.</b> Furthermore, by partitioning the measured fluxes along wind direction, this model can also be used in areas with nonuniform terrain but nonetheless provide spatially integrated fluxe...|$|R
40|$|The Tank Closure and Technology Development Groups are {{developing}} a strategy for closing the High Level Waste (HLW) tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Two Type IV tanks, 17 and 20 in the F-Area Tank Farm, have been successfully filled with grout. Type IV tanks at SRS do not contain cooling coils; on the other hand, {{the majority of the}} tanks (Type I, II, III and IIIA) do contain cooling coils. The current concept for closing tanks equipped with cooling coils is to pump grout into the cooling coils to prevent pathways for infiltrating water after tank closure. This task addresses the use of grout to fill intact cooling coils present in most of the remaining HLW tanks on Site. The overall task was divided into two phases. Phase 1 focused on the development of a grout formulation (mix design) <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> the HLW tank cooling coils. Phase 2 will be a large-scale demonstration of the filling of simulated cooling coils under field conditions using the cooling coil grout mix design recommended from Phase 1. This report summarizes the results of Phase 1, the development of the cooling coil grout formulation. A grout formulation is recommended for the full scale testing at Clemson Environmental Technology Laboratory (CETL) that is composed by mass of 90 % Masterflow (MF) 816 (a commercially available cable grout) and 10 % blast furnace slag, with a water to cementitious material (MF 816 + slag) ratio of 0. 33. This formulation produces a grout that meets the fresh and cured grout requirements detailed in the Task Technical Plan (2). The grout showed excellent workability under continuous mixing with minimal change in rheology. An alternative formulation using 90 % MF 1341 and 10 % blast furnace slag with a water to cementitious material ratio of 0. 29 is also acceptable and generates less heat per gram than the MF 816 plus slag mix. However this MF 1341 mix has a higher plastic viscosity than the MF 816 mix due to the presence of sand in the MF 1341 cable grout and a lower water to solids ratio. Nevertheless, the higher viscosity grout may still meet the requirements for the cooling coil grout under certain pumping conditions or alternatively, the mix may be made more fluid by a short period of high shear mixing during production. The mixes have not been optimized for large scale production. It may be possible, for example, to adjust the water to cementitious materials ratio to provide improved performance of these mixes based on the results and conclusions of the large scale testing at CETL. Recommendations from this task include incorporation of a backup mixing/pumping system that is either integrated into the system or is available for immediate use in case of a pump or mixer failure of the primary system. A second recommendation is to conduct a laboratory scale investigation to determine the impact of operational variation on the properties of the grout. This effort would be initiated after feedback is received from the large scale testing at CETL. The purpose of this proposed variability testing is to better understand the limits of the operational variations (such as temperature and mixing time), and to identify possible approaches for remediation to ensure that the grout produced will flow effectively in the coils while still meeting the performance requirements...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{determination}} of petrol filling station location in Surabaya has not considered the stakeholders’ preference on environmental safety perspective {{and also the}} sub surface condition yet. As a vital facility, this condition may lead to disastrous condition. Thus, {{the objective of this}} paper is to recommend petrol filling station location which is safe for environment and living community in surrounding. As the extend of previous work which is focus on stakeholders’ preference, this current work emphasized on subsurface condition which may influence the stability of petrol filling station infrastructure. However, the result of previous study still will be presented to keep the good coherence of the discussion. Three stages have been set up to reach the objective of this study. Firstly, assess the stakeholder's preference <b>for</b> petrol <b>filling</b> location criteria using AHP method. Secondly, assess and mapping the seismic microzonation using fuzzy clustering method. Thirdly, suitability analysis based on stakeholder's preference and seismic microzonation to find recommended location using GIS method. As the result of the study shows that based on stakeholder's preference, the proper selection of land use criteria appears as the most important criteria <b>for</b> determining petrol <b>filling</b> station location and yielded 31, 2 % influence. Based on seismic microzonation, the North part of Surabaya mainland from East to West which is near to Madura Straight is high susceptible for local seismic. As a conclusion based on the overlay mapping of these two findings, the Central part of Surabaya heading to West is the most <b>suitable</b> location <b>for</b> petrol <b>filling</b> station. The result of this study could be used as an evaluation <b>for</b> existing petrol <b>filling</b> station location or either for future preference. In another hand, it could be a very useful recommendation for zoning regulation to control the development of petrol filling station which doesn’t concern environmental safety...|$|R
