5|$|According to investigations, {{the attackers}} {{travelled}} by sea from Karachi, Pakistan, across the Arabian Sea, hijacked the Indian fishing trawler 'Kuber', killed {{the crew of}} four, then forced the captain to sail to Mumbai. After murdering the captain, the attackers entered Mumbai on a rubber dinghy. The captain of 'Kuber', Amar Singh Solanki, had earlier been imprisoned for six months in a Pakistani jail for illegally fishing in Pakistani waters. The attackers <b>stayed</b> <b>and</b> were trained by the Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safehouse at Azizabad near Karachi before boarding a small boat for Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|Hotel Valley Ho is a {{historic}} hotel in Scottsdale, Arizona. Also called the Valley Ho and, for 28 years, the Ramada Valley Ho, the hotel was originally designed by Edward L. Varney, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright. It first opened in 1956 with a forward-looking and futuristic design. Movie stars and famous baseball players <b>stayed,</b> <b>and</b> the building quickly became known for its trendsetting guests and its fashionable atmosphere. The success of the venture resulted in expansion in 1958, with two additional two-story wings of guest rooms extending to the north. Though initially proposed by Varney, a central tower of guest rooms, rising over the lobby, was not built.|$|E
5|$|Kelly's {{maternal}} {{grandfather was}} an Argentine-born, Italian-speaking opera singer, Count Ercole Filippini, a leading baritone for the La Scala Opera Company in Milan. Filippini was touring Australia in 1914 with a Spanish opera company when World War I broke out; Filippini <b>stayed</b> <b>and</b> later married Anne McPharland, {{one of his}} students. As Countessa Anne Filippini, she was Australia's first female symphony orchestra conductor. She sang the role of Marguerite in Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Radio Perth's performance of Faust in 1928. Kelly's grandparents started the Italo-Australian Opera Company, which toured {{the country in the}} 1920s.|$|E

5|$|According to the Mexican authorities, {{the murder}} plot was {{possibly}} {{carried out with}} the collaboration of the Tijuana Cartel because no security measures were taken during the party and because the entrances were {{open to the public}} (when they are usually closed for private events). The investigation was further {{complicated by the fact that}} many of the invitees—fearing for their lives—fled from the scene when Francisco Rafael was killed by the clown. Out of the 80 to 100 attendees, only 20 of them stayed, many of them family members and employees of the banquet hall. When the authorities interrogated those who <b>stayed</b> <b>and</b> asked them whether they had recognized the assassin or any other physical features, none of them were able to give any details. Some stated that they did not even pay attention to the clown when he entered the crime scene, while others stated that they did not even recall exactly what the clown was wearing, remembering only that the assassin was wearing a blue-stripped or purple shirt, a multicolored wig, and a red clown nose.|$|E

In any case, the situation in Trujillo was too precarious for Cerezeda to support a major expedition. D'Ávila became embroiled in the factional politics of the town, taking the part of Diego Díaz de Herrera. After a time, he decided to leave Honduras, and took passage {{with the majority of}} his men on a ship that stopped at Trujillo, which took them back to Yucatán. A few of D'Ávila's men <b>stayed</b> <b>and</b> settled in Trujillo, where the situation continued to deteriorate.|$|E
5|$|Leguat {{stated that}} the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} fed on dates, whereas Tafforet mentioned seeds and leaves. No other accounts mention diet. It has been suggested it ate latan palm fruits, for which it competed with the now extinct Cylindraspis tortoises. It is not known how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide crop milk. The risings on the crop of the female may have covered glands that produced the crop milk. If the theory is correct, the birds may have practiced a division of labour, where the female <b>stayed</b> <b>and</b> fed the young crop milk, while the male collected food in the crop and delivered it to the female. It {{has been suggested that}} the maximum size attained by the solitaire and the dodo was limited by the amount of crop milk they were able to produce for their young during early growth.|$|E

5|$|Sea Cloud {{was built}} in Kiel, Germany, as a barque for Marjorie Merriweather Post and her second husband Edward F. Hutton of Wall Street's E. F. Hutton & Co.. She was {{launched}} in 1931 as Hussar V; {{at the time of}} her construction, she was the largest private yacht in the world. In 1935, the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Joseph E. Davies, married Marjorie Merriweather Post. Mr. and Mrs. Davies renamed the ship Sea Cloud. Although Mrs. Davies owned the ship, she allowed Mr. Davies to claim ownership of the vessel. As a man with political influence, Davies entertained many high-profile people on the ship, including Queen Elisabeth of Belgium. The ship even served as an informal embassy, as Soviet and United States officials <b>stayed</b> <b>and</b> met on the vessel.|$|E
5|$|The arch gateway at {{the western}} end of the churchyard bears a skull and {{crossbones}} at the top of each pillar. The memorials in the churchyard are mainly dated 1750–1850, and most are lined against the churchyard's south wall or are flush with the ground. Some show fine carving, commensurate with commercial success. They include the memorials of French-born wine merchant Jean Gaudin and the Litherland brothers, founders of Royal Crown Derby. From 1804, French prisoners of war were quartered in Ashby, and those who died before their release, or who <b>stayed</b> <b>and</b> married local women, are also buried in the churchyard. A group of memorials are for members of a prosperous local family, the Mammatts. Edward Mammatt, church organist for 40 years and a successful scientist despite being blinded at age six, also has a monument in the church, and one of the Victorian windows is dedicated to his widow by their sons.|$|E

Middlesbrough finished the 1976–77 campaign in 12th place and Charlton left the club at the end of the season on the belief that four years was an optimum time with one group of players and that he had reached his peak with them – he later regretted his decision and stated that he could have led the club to a league title if he had <b>stayed</b> <b>and</b> signed two more top quality players. He applied for the job of England manager after Don Revie quit the role and after Brian Clough was ruled out by the Football Association but did not receive a reply to his application, and he vowed never to apply for another job again and instead wait until he was approached.|$|E

5|$|The new Virginia {{counties}} {{were growing}} rapidly, {{and with this}} growth came trouble. Trigg was appointed {{as one of the}} judges to the Virginia Land Court commission of 1779–80 charged with settling land disputes in Kentucky County, Virginia. The Virginia Land Act of 1779 had set up this court of four judges in order to examine the numerous land claims and to certify valid titles. The four judges arrived at St. Asaph in October and triggered emigration to Kentucky as people wished to either certify their claims or seek unclaimed land. They closed their court on February 26, 1780, and prepared to return home. However, in March they were told that they had to reopen the court and stay through April, as claimants were delayed due to weather. Trigg and two fellow judges reconvened on April 16 and heard another 134 cases. In all, the court judged 1,328 claims covering over 1 million acres (4,000km²) of land. After these sessions ended, Trigg <b>stayed</b> <b>and</b> established his home on 1,000 acres (4km²) of land at Trigg's Station about four miles (6km) north-west of Harrodsburg in Kentucky County, Virginia.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{risks of}} surgery and its {{clinical}} outcome are {{of great importance}} for both patients and physicians when choosing coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery for coronary artery disease. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to clarify the relationship between serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and patient clinical outcome. Seventy-six eligible patients who underwent CABG were enrolled into the prospective study. Venous blood samples were drawn for serum BNP and N-terminal (NT) -proBNP levels measurement on preoperative Day 1, postoperative Day 1, and postoperative Day 7. Clinical end points were: (1) intensive care unit (ICU) stay longer than 4 days postoperatively and/or hospital stay longer than 13 days postoperatively; (2) major complications and poor outcomes. Patients who had prolonged ICU <b>stay</b> <b>and</b> hospitalization had significantly higher postoperative Day 1 BNP and postoperative Day 1 NT-proBNP level (p =  0. 02 and 0. 005, respectively). Age was significantly older in patients with prolonged ICU <b>stay</b> <b>and</b> hospitalization than those without prolonged ICU <b>stay</b> <b>and</b> hospitalization (p =  0. 03). Serum creatinine level was also significantly increased in patients with prolonged ICU <b>stay</b> <b>and</b> hospitalization (p =  0. 009). However, age was the only remaining factor that correlated with prolonged ICU <b>stay</b> <b>and</b> hospitalization in the multivariate logistic regression model. These results suggest that research using BNP and NT-proBNP for predicting ICU <b>stay</b> <b>and</b> hospitalization in patients who have undergone CABG must adjust risk factors to present a more appropriate estimation of its clinical outcome...|$|R
