30|$|An abolishment of the {{labelling}} {{exception for}} cosmetic products {{would lead to}} a regular labelling requirement for containers bigger than 125 ml, e.g. most shampoos, shower gels or body lotions. Many cosmetic products which are sold in containers smaller than 125 ml would still not have to be labelled regularly because of the small quantity exception, which reads that only certain H-statements need to be written on the labels (see Table 1). This implies that for example <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> (<b>category</b> 2) and eye irritation (category 2) would not have to be written on the label of small containers. For better consumer information, the small quantity exception should be amended so that cosmetic products should be labelled and classified regularly, also when they are sold in smaller packages.|$|E
40|$|The {{mathematical}} model predicted that 1 -BP was {{absorbed by the}} skin. Additionally, there was an in vitro dermal penetration study identified that indicates that 1 -BP {{has the potential for}} substantial dermal penetration dependent on type and duration of exposure [Frasch et al. 2011]. A review of the available literature indicates that 1 -BP is capable of inducing a wide array of adverse systemic health effects, including neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, hematotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and developmental toxicity, regardless of exposure route [ClinTrials Bioresearch 1997; Zhao et al. 1999; Ichihara et al. 2000 a, 2000 b; WIL Research Laboratory 2001; Wang et al. 2002, 2003; Lee et al. 2005, 2007; Banu et al. 2007; Fueta et al. 2007]. Although the exact systemic hazards associated with skin contact and absorption of 1 -BP are unknown, 1 -BP is assigned the SK: SYS notation; this notation is based on the recognition of adverse health effects in test animals exposed via the inhalation, oral, and subcutaneous injection routes. Although a study using the EpiDerm human reconstructed epidermis model [Frasch et al. 2011] indicated that 1 -BP is not corrosive to the skin following exposure to 1 -BP, two in vivo tests, conducted with standard methods [Jacobs et al. 1987; P 1 lovics 2004], provide sufficient evidence that 1 -BP is irritating to the skin of rabbits. Although no human patch tests that evaluated the sensitization potential of 1 -BP were identified, one guinea pig maximization test [Elf Atochem 1995 b] showed that the substance is not a skin sensitizer. Therefore, {{on the basis of this}} assessment, 1 -BP is assigned the composite skin notation SK: SYS-DIR (IRR). Table 3 summarizes the skin designations for 1 -BP from NIOSH and other organizations. The equivalent skin designation for 1 -BP from the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling is Reproductive Category 1 B (Presumed human reproductive toxicant) and <b>Skin</b> <b>Irritation</b> <b>Category</b> 2 (Causes skin irritation) [European Parliament 2008].

40|$|The {{potential}} role of topical valproate (VPA) in hair regrowth {{has been}} recently suggested. However, safety reports of VPA as a topical formulation are lacking. Therefore, {{in the present}} study, we investigated whether VPA causes <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> in humans.

40|$|The ECVAM <b>Skin</b> <b>Irritation</b> Task Force was {{established}} in November 1996, primarily to prepare {{a report on the}} current status of the development and validation of alternative tests for <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> and corrosion and, in particular, to identify any appropriate non-animal tests for predicting human <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> which were sufficiently well-developed to warrant ECVAM supporting their prevalidation/validation. The task force based its discussions around the proposed testing strategy for skin irritation/corrosion emanating from an OECD workshop held in January 1996. The following have been reviewed: a) structure-activity and structure-property relationships for <b>skin</b> corrosion and <b>irritation,</b> b) the use of pH and acid/alkaline reserve measurements in predicting skin corrosivity; c) in vitro tests for skin corrosion; d) in vitro tests for <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> (keratinocyte cultures, organ cultures, and reconstituted human skin models), and e) human patch tests for <b>skin</b> <b>irritation,</b> It was apparent that, although several promising candidate in vitro tests for <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> (for example, reconstituted human skin methods, and human and animal skin organ culture methods) were under development and evaluation, a test protocol, a preliminary prediction model and supporting data on different types of chemicals were only available for a method employing EpiDerm™. Thus, it is proposed that this EpiDerm test undergoes prevalidation during 1998. In addition, since it was felt preferable to be able to include other in vitro tests in such a prevalidation study, it is recommended that a "challenge" be set to anyone interested in taking part. This involves submitting data on ten test chemicals selected by the task force, obtained according to a standard protocol with a preliminary prediction model, for review by the task force by 31 May 1998...|$|R
