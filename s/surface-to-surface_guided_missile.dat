5000|$|In 1951, Firestone {{was given}} the defense {{contract}} for the MGM-5 Corporal missile. Firestone was given a total of US$6,888,796 for the first 200 Missiles. This missile {{was known as the}} [...] "Embryo of the Army" [...] and was a <b>surface-to-surface</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missile</b> which could deliver a high-explosive warhead up to 75 nmi km. It was later modified to be able to carry a nuclear payload for use in the event of Cold War hostilities in Eastern Europe. This missile was replaced in 1962 by the MGM-29 Sergeant system.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{developed}} by the U.S. during World War II, was later expanded into a more general program including turbojet, ramjet, pulsejet, and rocket power. Straight wing, swept wing, and canard (tail first) air frames were investigated and visual, television, heat-homing, and three types of radar guidance were looked at for use as possible air-to-air, air-to-surface and <b>surface-to-surface</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missiles</b> and as target drones.|$|R
50|$|Dale {{entered the}} Charleston Naval Shipyard in March 1981 {{to begin a}} Baseline Overhaul to update the ship's combat weapons systems and {{overhaul}} major engineering equipment. During the overhaul, which Dale completed a month early in February 1982, the 3 inch/50 caliber gun mounts were replaced with Harpoon <b>surface-to-surface</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missiles</b> and the Phalanx gun system to the port and starboard sides. Dale completed Refresher Training in June 1982.|$|R

50|$|The Atago {{class is}} {{fundamentally}} an improved and scaled-up {{version of the}} Kongō-class destroyers. The class features large accommodation and the ships are capable of flexible operation. One of the most obvious changes is an additional hangar to carry one SH-60K helicopter. In comparison to the Kongō class/Arleigh Burke class (Flight I) which only had helicopter platforms (but no support equipment), these ships have better helicopter handling facilities. To enhance the Atago class' function as command centers, the bridge is two decks higher than aboard a Arleigh Burke class Flight IIA, making their full load displacement over 10,000 tons—the first time for a JMSDF surface combat vessel. The gun caliber has extended from the 54 caliber of the Kongō class to the 62 caliber with strengthened powder charge capable 38 km firing range. As with other Japanese ships being refit, the American-made Harpoon missiles (such as in the initial configuration of the Kongō class) have been replaced with the Japanese-made Type 90 (SSM-1B) <b>surface-to-surface</b> <b>guided</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R

50|$|Live {{artillery}} firing {{takes place}} at Munster South using M109 and PzH howitzers. In addition, Marder infantry fighting vehicles, equipped with MILAN <b>surface-to-surface</b> anti-tank <b>guided</b> <b>missiles,</b> Luchs recce tanks and Fennek recce vehicles also use the ranges. Training Area South also has bivouac sites and ranges for small arms and anti-tank weapons. Ground-based trials with MILAN surface-surface anti-tank <b>guided</b> <b>missile</b> were carried out here. In addition there are grenade ranges, explosives ranges, infantry battle ranges and target areas for the German Air Force, the Luftwaffe, firing rockets and bombs from their Tornado fighter-bombers. Bölkow Bo 105 anti-tank helicopters exercise here, firing HOT 3105 <b>guided</b> <b>missiles.</b> Exercising troops from Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Britain can be accommodated in Trauen Camp (Lager Trauen) where there are facilities for 1,750 soldiers.|$|R
5000|$|The Shaheen-II (Urdu:شاهين-اا; codename: Hatf-VI Shaheen) is a {{land-based}} supersonic <b>surface-to-surface</b> medium-range <b>guided</b> ballistic <b>missile.</b> The Shaheen-II {{is designed}} and {{developed by the}} NESCOM and the National Defence Complex (NDC) of Pakistan. [...] The Shaheen missile series is named after a falcon that lives {{in the mountains of}} Pakistan. The missile is considered to be Pakistan's equivalent to the US Pershing II.
