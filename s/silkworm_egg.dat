40|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} diapausing egg of the silkworm contains a substance which is transmitted from the mother and has an inhibitory action upon the develop-ment of the embryo. Watanabe (1924) was the first author to explain the pheno-menon of diapause in the <b>silkworm</b> <b>egg</b> by postulating this substance which he called 'inhibitory substance', and almost all subsequent authors in Japan have accepted this assumption. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the 'inhibitory substance', which reveals its action in the egg after deposition, has some connexion with the diapause factor (hormone) secreted by the suboesophageal ganglion of the mother (Hasegawa, 1951, 1952; Fukuda, 1951), but nothing {{is known about the}} real nature and action of the diapause factor (Fukuda, 1955). On the other hand, Umeya (1937 a, b, 1938, 1939, 1952) insists that in the diapausing egg, although the embryo is always ready to grow, some unfavourable condition of the yolk surrounding the embryo inhibits its development beyond a certain stage during diapause, while Miura (1932 a, b, 1938) claims that not only the yolk, but also the embryo itself remains inactive in the diapausing egg.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} over the years {{utilized}} gravity models derived from trade theories to investigate how various factors affect trade in agricultural goods. Although technological improvements could be considered in such models, few studies have considered this topic in depth, leaving a void to fill. To partly fill this void, this study has chosen the silk sector to analyze the impact of technological improvements – more specifically yield increases through the introduction of silkworm hybrids – on silk exports. This sector is particularly interesting as it is highly labor-intensive, generates a high-value added and requires little land area for cultivation, thereby having the potential to reduce poverty. Additionally, as the supply of silk from the main exporter China has decreased in recent years, {{there is a possibility}} for other countries to overtake China’s earlier role. By dint of data and information collected from publications and over 30 research institutions, 26 silk exporting countries are qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed over the period 2000 - 2010. In the qualitative analysis, the study classifies countries ’ silk sectors according to their performance in research, and in grainage – i. e. <b>silkworm</b> <b>egg</b> provision – by drawing on arguments from two studies considering technological improvements in African cotton sectors. In the quantitative analysis, a gravity model is used. The study concludes that there is a significantly positive relationship between introduced silkworm hybrids and silk exports. Moreover, for a country to increase its silk exports, the country should aim to make funding available for research and grainage, and to foster collaboration between research institutions...|$|E

Secondly, the new characteristics of modern sericultural industry development and change have been analyzed. The primitive consciousness and basic goal of modern sericultural industry production show diversification, so the original reference of judgment is not single. The new development orientation of modern sericultural industry is production systems, besides, the effect of rural labor force becomes more important, becomes the main factor which restricts the sustainable development of modern sericultural industry, and then the new features of judgment index system are explored. â‘  Allosteric characteristics of main index system.
