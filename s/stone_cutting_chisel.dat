40|$|Introduction: The workers {{employed}} in <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> workplace {{are exposed to}} hand-arm vibration and its complications. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the exposure to hand-arm vibration and its health effects on workers in the <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> workshops. Methods: In this descriptive-analytic study, 40 workers of Hamadan city <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> who worked with <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> machines were examined. Measuring exposure to hand-arm vibration was performed by standard methods ISO 5349. Symptoms related hand-arm vibration syndrome using a questionnaire construction was studied. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Results: Results showed that 8 -hour equivalent acceleration of hand-arm vibration exposure in stonecuttingworkers was exceeds the permissible exposure levels of country (Pv< 0. 05). Most average hand and arm vibration acceleration was measured in the Z axis. The average vibration acceleration hand-arm and cutting transverse and longitudinal cutting significant difference was observed (Pv< 0. 05). Conclusion: In regard to exposure level of <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> workers compared with the national exposure limit, the training of health care, non-smoking, and use of anti-vibration gloves, work rotations canthe effective in reducing the risk of health effects. Furthermore, it seems essential to track the health effects associated with human vibration by use of screening tests in the work place seem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Stone</b> <b>cutting</b> {{industry}} {{is one of}} the major environmental pollutants in Palestine. The pollution process starts by mining rocks from quarries and transporting them to <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> plants distributed around the West Bank. The mining and transporting process is usually associated with different types of pollution such as air, noise and soil contamination. In <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> plants, rock blocks are cut into different sizes and shapes. The cutting and shaping process is accomplished by using metal saws which need a tremendous amount of cooling water. The cooling water is discharged out of the plant as highly viscous material referred to as stone slurry waste. The stone slurry waste poses a serious environmental hazard. At present most of the stone slurry waste produced b...|$|R

40|$|Background &amp; Aims of the Study: The {{wastewater}} {{created as}} a result of <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> industries enters some pools for re-consumption so that its suspended solids settle by gravity. By taking to account the high volume of water and sludge, treatment of wastewater and removal of sludge cause many problems for <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> units. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the quality of wastewater and to investigate the effects of coagulants on suspended solids removal efficiency from wastewater of some <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> industries (Qom, Iran). Materials &amp; Methods: In this experimental study, the effects of different doses of coagulants including Alum, poly aluminum chloride, Polymer, Ferric chloride (Fecl 3) and Lime on Turbidity, “total suspended solids” (TSS) and “total solids” (TS) removal were investigated by Jar Test. Removal efficiency of different coagulates was estimated. Results: The results indicated that lime in dose 100 PPM is the best coagulant for turbidity removal and the highest efficiency for TS removal is related to using Alum in dose 100 PPM. Conclusions: Considering the findings of this study, it can be concluded that using coagulants causes reduction in settling time and speeds up the return of water to the consumption cycle of <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> factories, and also increases turbidity removal efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Noise {{is one of}} the {{important}} injurious agents causing hearing loss orvarious incidents. High levels of noise pollution affect workers in stone industries. Iran has theworld second rank in production of 9 million tone stone. There are 1806 <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> and 230 <b>stone</b> processing units with 6 million tones processing in the country, of them 22 <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> and 3. 2 percent of stone processing units are located in Hamedan province. Method: In this survey 10 <b>stone</b> <b>cutting</b> units of Malayer district were chosen. Noise pollutionwas measured by sound level meter (model 2230 B&K). General noise using grinding method andworker posture was measured. One octave band frequency analyzing was measured in 21 stations(more than 85 dBA). Equivalent levels (leq) and Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) werecalculated for 40 workers in the units. Results:Average leq was 91. 1 dBA (SD: 5. 5) and mean work experience was 10. 9 (SD: 5. 5) years). Regression analysis showed a significant correlation between NIHL and Leq (8 hr) (p< 0. 05). NIHL and work experience was also correlated (P< 0. 05). Granite stone industriesoctave band noise analysis had a major SPL in high frequency while other industries had lowfrequency.
