25|$|Merozoites use the apicomplexan {{invasion}} organelles (apical complex, pellicle and <b>surface</b> <b>coat)</b> {{to recognize}} and enter the host erythrocyte (red blood cell). The parasite first binds to the erythrocyte in a random orientation. It then reorients such that the apical complex is in proximity to the erythrocyte membrane. The parasite forms a parasitophorous vesicle, to allow for its development inside the erythrocyte. This infection cycle occurs in a highly synchronous fashion, with roughly all of the parasites throughout the blood in the same stage of development. This precise clocking mechanism {{has been shown to}} be dependent on the human host's own circadian rhythm.|$|E

Each liver stage can produce up to 90,000 merozoites, which are eventually released into the bloodstream in parasite-filled vesicles called merosomes.|$|E

Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate and compare the fluoride release from conventional glass ionomer cement with and without <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> agent. Settings and Design: This in vitro study comprised of total 80 samples (40 samples of each with and without <b>surface</b> <b>coating).</b> Materials and Methods: Specimens were prepared, G coat plus was applied and light cured. Fluoride release of the sample was measured every 24 h for 7 days and weekly from 7 th to 21 st day using Sension 4 pH/ISE/MV Meter. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive Statistics, Repeated Measure ANOVA, Paired Sample t-test, Independent Sample t-test, Scheffe post hoc test. Results: Mean values clearly reveal a significant decrease in the fluoride release from day 1 to day 21 for both groups. Non-coated group released significantly more fluoride than <b>surface</b> <b>coated</b> group (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: It can be concluded that nanofilled <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> agent will reduce the amount of fluoride released into oral environment as compared to non-coated group and at the same time releasing fluoride into surrounding cavity walls to create zones of inhibition into the cavity floor to help internal remineralization...|$|R

50|$|Variant surface {{glycoprotein}} (VSG) is a ~60kDa protein which densely packs {{the cell}} surface of protozoan parasites {{belonging to the}} genus Trypanosoma. They form a 12-15 nm <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> and were first isolated from Trypanosoma brucei in 1975 by George Cross. VSG allows the trypanosomatid parasites to evade the mammalian host's immune system by extensive antigenic variation. VSG has no prescribed biochemical activity. The parasite has a large cellular repertoire of antigenically distinct VSGs (~1500 complete and partial (pseudogenes)) located in telomeric and subtelomeric arrays (on megabase chromosomes or minichromosomes). VSGs are expressed from a bloodstream expression site (BES, ES) in a polycistron by RNA polymerase I (recruited to a ribosomal-type promoter) with other ES-associated genes (ESAGs), of which transferrin receptor (Tfr: ESAG6, ESAG7) is one. Only one VSG gene is expressed at a time, as {{only one of the}} ~15 ES are active in a cell. VSG expression is 'switched' by homologous recombination of a silent basic copy gene from an array (directed by homology) into the active telomerically-located expression site. Interestingly, mosaic VSG genes can be created by homologous recombination of a partial VSG gene from an array. This partial gene may replace any portion of the residing VSG gene, creating a new mosaic VSG.|$|E

Cytotoxic examination (MTT assay and LDH release) showed organic QDs to induce significant cytotoxicity up to 48 h, even at a low particle concentration (20 nM), whilst both COOH and NH(2) (PEG) QDs caused reduced cell viability and cell membrane permeability after 24 and 48 h exposure at 80 nM. Subsequent analysis of the elements that constitute the QD core, core/shell and (organic QD) <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> showed that the <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> drives QD toxicity.

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} fine structure of the microvilli on jejunal and colonic epithelial cells of the mouse intestine has been made. The microvilli in these two locations demonstrate a remarkably similar fine structure {{with respect to the}} thickness of the plasma membrane, the extent of the filament-free zone, and the characteristics of the microfilaments situated within the microvillous core. Some of the core microfilaments appear to continue across the plasma membrane limiting the tip of the microvillus. The main difference between the microvilli of small intestine and colon is in the extent and organization of the <b>surface</b> <b>coat.</b> In the small intestine, in addition to the commonly observed thin surface "fuzz," occasional areas of the jejunal villus show a more conspicuous <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> covering the tips of the microvilli.

In contrast to the jejunal epithelium, the colonic epithelium is endowed with a thicker <b>surface</b> <b>coat.</b> Variations in the organization of the <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> at different levels of the colonic crypts have also been noted.

Digestion with hyaluronidase eliminated the stainability of the <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> to both agents. Combined digestion with chondroitinase ABC, heparitinase and keratanase eliminated the cationic iron colloid staining but did {{not interfere with the}} aldehyde fuchsin staining. Electron microscopy of ultrathin sections revealed that the iron particles were deposited in the perineuronal tissue spaces. These findings indicate that the <b>surface</b> <b>coat</b> consists of sulfated proteoglycans which occupy, as the extracellular matrix, the perineuronal tissue spaces. Many neurons in the retrosplenial cortex were labeled with lectin Vicia villosa agglutinin. Double staining revealed that these lectin-labeled neurons are usually reactive to cationic iron colloid.

Project objectives were: 1) To develop a database of information regarding <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> facilities in Texas; 2) To estimate maximum emission rates for various VOC species from <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> facilities in Texas; 3) To conduct dispersion modeling to estimate off-site impacts from <b>surface</b> <b>coating</b> facilities.

The database was designed to include information important for estimating emission rates, and for using as inputs to the dispersion model. Hourly and annual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), and exempt solvents (ES) were calculated for each permitted entity/ company in the database, according to equations given by TCEQ. Dispersion modeling was then conducted for 3 facility configurations (worst-case stack height, good practice stack height, and fugitive emissions), for urban and rural dispersion parameters, for 8 -hour and 24 -hour operating scenarios, and for 1 -hour, 24 -hour, and annual averaging times, for a total of 36 scenarios.
