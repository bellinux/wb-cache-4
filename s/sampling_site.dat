5|$|Two years later, a joint {{study by}} Manhattan College and the New York State Water Resources Institute found {{high levels of}} human fecal {{bacteria}} in the water, likely due to municipal wastewater. All 12 sites exceeded the state maximum of a monthly median of 200 organisms per 100 milliliters (ml) over five months. Levels were, as {{with most of the}} river's other pollutants, generally the highest near the mouth. However, the uppermost <b>sampling</b> <b>site</b> in the study, at the Chappaqua Metro-North station recorded the greatest single reading of any site, 1.2 × 10 organisms per 100 ml, as well as the second-highest; the researchers speculated that this was due to sewer overflow in the area at the times of those readings. Most of the high coliform readings came after rainfall except at the two sites furthest downstream; the study theorized that some older buildings in this area of Yonkers may still discharge sewage directly to the river. Since most of the Saw Mill River flows under the shade of a forest canopy, the bacteria may be less likely to be inactivated by sunlight than in other streams.|$|E

50|$|The low-flow-rate {{method is}} {{based on the fact that}} the {{extraction}} efficiency is dependent on the flow-rate.

Concentration at the <b>sampling</b> <b>site</b> can be determined by plotting the extraction ratios against the corresponding flow-rates and extrapolating to zero-flow.

40|$|AbstractThe field {{monitoring}} is {{an essential}} tool to define geotechnical model able to assess landslide stability conditions, with particular reference to the hydrological response of the slopes in presence of widespread landslide events — the occurrence of several landslides trough wide areas. The results relative to two <b>sample</b> <b>sites,</b> representative of study areas characterised by homogeneous geological elements and where field monitoring {{has been carried out}} for adequate time intervals, are illustrated in the paper. In particular, we consider an area with outcroppings formed by a sort of “melange structure” made up of blocks and fragments of phyllites, clays, shales, ect., in a prevalently clayey matrix (Lungro <b>sample</b> <b>site),</b> and an area where are present rocks and soils deriving from weathering of crystalline rocks (“Serra di Buda”, Acri, <b>sample</b> <b>site).</b> In the Lungro <b>sample</b> <b>site</b> a piezometer monitoring network and a rain gauge give indications about the hydrological response of the slopes in an urban area; in the “Serra di Buda” <b>sample</b> <b>site</b> the piezometer levels measured for a long time period, and the rainfall, permit to identify some relationships between the cumulative rainfall and the piezometric levels.

50|$|During {{calibration}} {{with the}} no-net-flux-method, the microdialysis probe is perfused {{with at least}} four different concentrations of the analyte of interest (Cin) and steady-state concentrations of the analyte leaving the probe are measured in the dialysate (Cout). The recovery for this method can be determined by plotting Cout−Cin over Cin and computing {{the slope of the}} regression line. If analyte concentrations in the perfusate are equal to concentrations at the <b>sampling</b> <b>site,</b> no-net flux occurs. Respective concentrations at the no-net-flux point are represented by the x-intercept of the regression line. The strength of this method is that, at steady-state, no assumptions about the behaviour of the compound {{in the vicinity of the}} probe have to be made, since equilibrium exists at a specific time and place. However, under transient conditions (e.g. after drug challenge), the probe recovery may be altered resulting in biased estimates of the concentrations at the <b>sampling</b> <b>site.</b> To overcome this limitation, several approaches have been developed that are also applicable under non-steady-state conditions. One of these approaches is the dynamic no-net-flux method.|$|E
5000|$|Efficiency is {{the notion}} of how much is gained by a given amount of work. A more {{efficient}} method provides better results for the same amount of work. The proportionator provides a better estimate, that is a more precise estimate, than either of these two methods: the optical fractionator and physical dissector [...] The PPS is implemented by assigning a value to a <b>sampling</b> <b>site.</b> This value is the characteristic of the <b>sampling</b> <b>site.</b> The proportionator becomes the optical fractionator if the characteristic is constant, i.e. the same, for all sampling sites. If there is no difference between sampling sites, then the proportionator behaves the same as the optical fractionator. In actual sampling, the characteristic varies across the tissue being studied. Information about the distribution of the characteristic is used to refine the sampling. The greater the variance of the characteristic, the greater the efficiency of the proportionator. What this means to the stereologist is simple: if you need to count more and more to get the CE needed to publish just stop and switch to the proportionator.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{constant}} perfusion of the microdialysis probe with fresh perfusate, a total equilibrium cannot be established. This results in dialysate concentrations that are lower than those measured at the distant <b>sampling</b> <b>site.</b> In order to correlate concentrations measured in the dialysate with those present at the distant <b>sampling</b> <b>site,</b> a calibration factor (recovery) is needed. The recovery can be determined at steady-state using {{the constant}} rate of analyte exchange across the microdialysis membrane. The rate at which an analyte is exchanged across the semipermeable membrane is generally expressed as the analyte’s extraction efficiency. The extraction efficiency {{is defined as the}} ratio between the loss/gain of analyte during its passage through the probe (Cin−Cout) and the difference in concentration between perfusate and distant <b>sampling</b> <b>site</b> (Cin−Csample).In theory, the extraction efficiency of a microdialysis probe can be determined by: 1) changing the drug concentrations while keeping the flow rate constant or 2) changing the flow rate while keeping the respective drug concentrations constant. At steady-state, the same extraction efficiency value is obtained, no matter if the analyte is enriched or depleted in the perfusate. [...] Microdialysis probes can consequently be calibrated by either measuring the loss of analyte using drug-containing perfusate or the gain of analyte using drug-containing sample solutions. To date, the most frequently used calibration methods are the low-flow-rate method, the no-net-flux method, the dynamic (extended) no-net-flux method, and the retrodialysis method. [...] The proper selection of an appropriate calibration method is critically important for the success of a microdialysis experiment. Supportive in vitro experiments prior to the use in animals or humans are therefore recommended. [...] In addition, the recovery determined in vitro may differ from the recovery in humans. Its actual value therefore needs to be determined in every in vivo experiment.|$|E
