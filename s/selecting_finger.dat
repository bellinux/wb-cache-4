40|$|The {{model of}} the {{interdigital}} capacitor (IDC) {{has been used for}} monitoring and analysing the dielectric properties of thin ferroelectric films. The dielectric properties of the film are correlated to its crystalline structure using a simple model of STO. The results of the analysis may be used for optimisation of growth and annealing processes of the films and reducing the effects of the electrode ferroelectric interface. The model can be used to optimise the design of IDCs in the sense of minimum losses and maximum controllability by <b>selecting</b> <b>finger</b> width and gapwidth of the IDC. Further improvement of the model suggests a comprehensive study of all possible mechanisms affecting the dielectric constant and the losses of STO film...|$|E

Criteria to consider when <b>selecting</b> <b>finger</b> plays, such as learning expectations and the time of year and day, are listed. Specific steps to follow when presenting finger plays are also listed, and materials for illustrating finger plays are suggested.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is on two types of handshapes: those that {{represent}} the object (2 ̆ 2 object 2 ̆ 2 handshapes, referred to as 2 ̆ 7 entity 2 ̆ 7 classifier handshapes in the sign language literature) and those that represent the manipulation of the object (2 ̆ 2 handling 2 ̆ 2 handshapes). These handshapes are studied in native Deaf signing and hearing gesturing groups at three ages-younger child, older child, and adult. An experiment was designed in which short 2 ̆ 7 vignettes 2 ̆ 7 involving intransitive and transitive events were shown to {{participants in the study}} groups. They responded manually. Signers signed the event descriptions; gesturers gestured their event descriptions without voice. ^ Two grammatical features guide the distribution of the productive use of classifier handshapes at the syntactic and phonological levels of analysis: (1) the intransitive/transitive opposition of object and handle classifier handshapes; and (2) the <b>selected</b> <b>finger</b> complexity assigned to entity, as opposed to handle, classifier handshapes (Benedicto 2 ̆ 6 Brentari, 2004; Eccarius 2 ̆ 6 Brentari, 2007). This project documents how signers and gesturers show different distributional patterns of handshape with respect to these two linguistic features. Results conclude that the presence of an adequate language model is required for the emergence of sign language linguistic properties to appear. ^ Findings contribute to the limited research of American Sign Language (ASL) acquisition. The association of object and handle handshapes to intransitive and transitive events develops with time. Errors from the descriptions of intransitive and transitive events demonstrate strikingly different patterns; young gesturing children produce handling handshapes more often in expected contexts (transitive events) than young signing children, indicating that native signers are not using a gestural strategy when faced with linguistic complexity of expressing transitive events with classifiers. The association of handshapes with high <b>selected</b> <b>finger</b> complexity to entity classifiers is realized at a young age (before age four). In addition, the inventory of classifier handshapes used to represent objects in intransitive event descriptions increases and expands in <b>selected</b> <b>finger</b> complexity with time. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{case study}} of American Sign Language (ASL) {{acquisition}} revealed an emerging phonological system influenced by biological, cognitive, and linguistic factors. A hearing child (SJ), acquiring ASL from her Deaf parents, was videotaped over seven sessions {{between the ages of}} 1 : 0 and 2 : 1. Of the 1, 699 manual behaviors observed, 804 were lexical items, or signs. All signs were phonetically coded. Detailed analyses were undertaken to discover acquisition patterns for the three major parameters of ASL signs (handshape, hand location and movement). Overall, SJ's signs were well-formed and adhered to ASL phonological constraints. Location primes were produced accurately, due to SJ's knowledge of the structure of her body. Errors occurred with body parts that were not perceptually salient. Movement parameters were not mastered by SJ during the period of study; no systematic set of substitutions was observed. Handshapes were produced with low accuracy. SJ relied on a small set of maximally contrastive handshapes (i. e., (5, 1,A)). These handshapes represent the convergence of ease of production, distribution in the target language phonology, and perceptual salience. SJ used three processes to fit target handshapes to her emerging phonological system: spreading of <b>selected</b> <b>fingers,</b> changing of <b>selected</b> <b>fingers</b> from a marked to an unmarked set, and changing to an open position. These processes reflect anatomical and perceptual preferences as well as linguistic influences. SJ's sign production showed a small improvement in accuracy and a marked reduction in variability between the ages of 1 : 0 AND 2 : 1. Visual feedback did not affect the sign accuracy. A passive hand was more likely to be added to one-handed signs produced outside the visual field, possibly increasing tactile feedback. Path movement and horizontal-place primes were more accurate when tactile feedback was present. There was no evidence that SJ used lexical selection or imitation as strategies for phonological acquisition. Finally, many of the same factors that influence phonological acquisition in speech guided SJ's acquisition of handshape primes. Her acquisition of location primes, by contrast, did not resemble processes observed in phonological acquisition in speech...|$|R

Materials and methods: A total of 237 children aged 12 – 16  years, who attended our outpatient clinic {{in a government}} medical college, were <b>selected.</b> <b>Finger</b> and palm prints were collected, and fingertip pattern frequencies, total ridge counts (TRCs), and atd angles (formed by the triradii below {{the first and last}} digits and that in the hypothenar region of the palm) were calculated. These parameters were analyzed with their Angle’s class of malocclusion using appropriate statistical tests. Dermatoglyphic parameters were examined and asymmetry analysis was conducted in subjects with different occlusion patterns. Results: Although no fingerprint pattern was found to be specific for a particular class of occlusion, increased tendencies toward high frequencies of whorls in subjects with class II malocclusion and plain arches in those with class III malocclusion were observed. Significant differences in atd angle and TRC were observed among malocclusion types (p =  0. 0001). Asymmetry scores did not differ significantly. Conclusion: Dermatoglyphic analysis can be used as an indicator of malocclusion at an early age, thereby aiding the development of treatments aiming to establish favorable occlusion.

In the Pressure phase, a pressure stimulus was applied {{onto one of the}} joints of the <b>selected</b> <b>finger.</b> For each finger and joint, BA 2 areas activated by the pressure stimulus were extracted by the region of interest method. There was {{a significant difference in the}} activation areas for the different fingers (P&# 8202;=&# 8202;. 042) as well as for the different joints (P&# 8202;=&# 8202;. 050). The activation area decreased in the order of the little, index, and middle fingers, as well as in the order of p 1, p 3, and p 2. close...|$|R
40|$|We have {{screened}} Xenopus laevis cDNA and genomic libraries for finger motif encoding sequences {{by use of}} {{a synthetic}} oligonucleotide probe coding for a stretch of conserved amino acids, the H/C-link, which joins individual finger loops in several multi-fingered proteins. Our studies reveal {{that a large number}} of different cDNA clones encode amino acid sequences predicting multiple units of the metal-coordinating finger structure. Derived proteins are different from each other as well as from the two examples of Xenopus finger proteins reported to date, TFIIIA and X. fin. The 109 finger repeats characterized are derived from 14 different cDNA clones and have been analysed for the presence of conserved and highly variable amino acids, revealing a close structural relatedness among each other as well as with a few <b>selected</b> <b>finger</b> domains from Drosophila and mouse proteins. The results from this comparative sequence analysis are also discussed in terms of the existing models for DNA binding. All sequences are identified in an ovary cDNA library but the patterns of mRNA level for individual finger clones vary greatly during early development. The prevalence of these structures in the oocyte suggests that part of the maternal information for the realization of the developmental program utilized in Xenopus embryogenesis might be transmitted in the form of regulatory, nucleic-acid-binding proteins...|$|R
60|$|We {{have often}} to regret that {{scientific}} eminence {{is not always}} accompanied by scientific logic. Where science neglects a subject, charlatans and dupes take it up. In England 'animal magnetism' had been abandoned to this class of enthusiasts, till Thackeray's friend, Dr. Elliotson, devoted himself to the topic. He was persecuted as doctors know how to persecute; but in 1841, Braid, of Manchester, discovered that the so-called 'magnetic sleep' could be produced without any 'magnetism,' He made his patients stare fixedly at an object, and encouraged them to expect to go to sleep. He called his method 'Hypnotism,' a term which begs no question. Seeming to cease to be mysterious, hypnotism became all but respectable, and was being used in surgical operations, till it was superseded by chloroform. In England, the study has been, and remains, rather suspect, while on The Continent hypnotism is used both for healing purposes and in the inquiries of experimental psychology. Wide differences of opinion still exist, as {{to the nature of}} the hypnotic sleep, as to its physiological concomitants, and as to the limits of the faculties exercised in or out of the slumber. It is not even absolutely certain that the exercise of the stranger faculties--for instance, that the production of anaesthesia and rigidity--are the results merely of 'suggestion' and expectancy. A hypnotised patient is told that the middle finger of his left hand will become rigid and incapable of sensation. This occurs, and is explained by 'suggestion,' though how 'suggestion' produces the astonishing effect is another problem. The late Mr. Gurney, however, made a number of experiments in which no suggestion was pronounced, nor did the patients know which of their fingers was to become rigid and incapable of pain. The patient's hands were thrust through a screen; on the other side of which the hypnotist made passes above the finger which was to become rigid. The lookers-on <b>selected</b> the <b>finger,</b> and the insensibility was tested by a strong electric current. The effect was also produced without passes, the operator merely pointing at the <b>selected</b> <b>finger,</b> and 'willing' the result. If he did not 'will' it, nothing occurred, nor did anything occur if he willed without pointing. The proximity of the operator's hand produced no effect if he did not 'will,' nor was his 'willing' successful if he did not bring his hand near that of the patient. Other people's hands, similarly situated, produced no effect.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) in a wedge geometry. Arneodo and collaborators {{have suggested}} that the ensemble average of DLA cluster density should be close to the noise-free <b>selected</b> Saffman-Taylor <b>finger.</b> We show that a different, but related, ensemble average, that of the conformal maps associated with random clusters, yields a non-trivial shape which is also not far from the Saffman-Taylor finger. However, we have previously demonstrated that the same average of DLA in a channel geometry is not the Saffman-Taylor finger. This casts doubt on the idea that the average of noisy diffusion-limited growth is governed by a simple transcription of noise-free results. Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures. Submitted to Chao...|$|R

40|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to {{the human}} primary motor cortex (M 1) causes bidirectional changes in corticospinal excitability depending on the stimulation frequency used. We used functional brain imaging to compare the effects of 5 Hz and 1 Hz-rTMS on local and inter-regional connectivity within the motor system. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured as a marker of synaptic activity at rest and during freely <b>selected</b> <b>finger</b> movements. We hypothesized that increased cortical excitability induced by 5 Hz-rTMS over M 1 has an opposite effect on the synaptic activity and the connectivity of the motor network from the decreased cortical excitability induced by 1 Hz-rTMS. rTMS at both frequencies induced similar changes in rCBF {{at the site of}} stimulation and within areas of the motor network engaged by the task. The two frequencies showed different effects on movement-related coupling between motor areas. Connectivity analyses also indicated a differential effect of 5 and 1 Hz-rTMS on motor network connectivity, suggesting a role for an inferomedial portion of left M 1 and left dorsal premotor cortex in maintaining performance. These results suggest that rapid reorganization of the motor system occurs to maintain task performance during periods of altered cortical excitability. This reorganization differs according to the modulation of excitability which is a function of rTMS frequency. This study extends the work of Lee et al. (Lee, L., Siebner, H. R., Rowe, J. B., Rizzo, V. Rothwell, J. C. Frackowiak, R. S. Friston, K. J., 2003. Acute remapping within the motor system induced by low-frequency repetitive {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}}. J.

40|$|A structure-based {{approach}} {{was used to}} design RNA-binding zinc fingers that recognize the HIV- 1 Rev response element (RRE). An arginine-rich α-helix from HIV- 1 Rev was engineered into the zinc finger framework, and the designed fingers were shown to bind specifically to the RRE with high affinity and in a zinc-dependent manner, and display cobalt absorption and CD spectra characteristic of properly folded fingers. The results indicate that a monomeric zinc finger can recognize a specific nucleic acid site and that the α-helix of a finger {{can be used to}} recognize the major groove of RNA as well as DNA. The RRE-binding zinc fingers demonstrate how structure-based approaches may be used in the design of potential RNA-binding therapeutics and provide a framework for <b>selecting</b> RNA-binding <b>fingers</b> with desired specifications...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a bacterial “two-hybrid” system that readily allows selection from libraries larger than 108 in size. Our bacterial system {{may be used to}} study either protein–DNA or protein—protein interactions, and it offers a number of potentially significant advantages over existing yeast-based one-hybrid and two-hybrid methods. We tested our system by <b>selecting</b> zinc <b>finger</b> variants (from a large randomized library) that bind tightly and specifically to desired DNA target sites. Our method allows sequence-specific zinc fingers to be isolated in a single selection step, and thus it should be more rapid than phage display strategies that typically require multiple enrichment/amplification cycles. Given the large library sizes our bacterial-based selection system can handle, this method should provide a powerful tool for identifying and optimizing protein–DNA and protein–protein interactions...|$|R
40|$|We have qualitatively {{explained}} the experiments of McCloud and Maher (McCloud and Maher (95)) for the viscous fingering problem {{in which an}} anisotropy in the surface tension parameter was imposed by engraving a grid {{in one of the}} plates of the Hele-Shaw cell. We saw the need to approach the problem in an analytical form. Therefore we decided to extend solvability theory to incorporate the effect of anisotropy. We have introduced the anisotropy through a moving boundary condition by considering an effective anisotropic surface tension with an anisotropy entering as the simplest cosine term having the right symmetry for a square lattice. We carried out the singular perturbation appropriate for the surface tension parameter assuming the length scale introduced by the anisotropy is small in comparison with the length scale introduced by the surface tension. In this sense, the perturbation can be said to be microscopic. For the case in which the surface tension has a maximum at the finger tip, our theory provides two possible solutions: one corresponding to the solution of the isotropic case and a new solution which, below a threshold of the surface tension parameter, predicts a wider finger than the isotropic solution. Intuitively, we expect the "old" solution, namely the one that does not differ from the isotropic case, to be the selected solution for large values of the surface tension parameter and we expect the new solution to be selected for small values of the surface tension parameter. This was confirmed by dynamical simulations of the interface done by David Jasnow. His simulation predicts that for the case in which the surface tension has a maximum at the finger tip, anisotropy is irrelevant for large values of the surface tension parameter. Furthermore below a threshold in this surface tension parameter, the <b>selected</b> <b>finger</b> width is systematically wider than the corresponding isotropic case. We conclude that our solvability theory together with the dynami...|$|R
40|$|Neuroplasticity {{underlies}} the brain’s ability to alter perception and behavior through training, practice, or simply exposure to sensory stimulation. Improvement of tactile discrimination has been repeatedly demonstrated after repetitive sensory stimulation (rSS) of the fingers; however, it remains unknown if such protocols also affect hand dexterity or pain thresholds. We therefore stimulated the {{thumb and index}} finger of young adults to investigate, besides testing tactile discrimination, the impact of rSS on dexterity, pain, and touch thresholds. We observed an improvement in the pegboard task where subjects used the {{thumb and index finger}} only. Accordingly, stimulating 2 fingers simultaneously potentiates the efficacy of rSS. In fact, we observed a higher gain of discrimination performance as compared to a single-finger rSS. In contrast, pain and touch thresholds remained unaffected. Our data suggest that <b>selecting</b> particular <b>fingers</b> modulates the efficacy of rSS, thereby affecting processes controlling sensorimotor integration...|$|R

40|$|A phage display {{approach}} was utilized {{to modify the}} specificity {{of each of the}} three fingers of the murine transcription factor Zif 268. Selections were performed by using the consensus binding sequence of the natural protein and a conserved sequence in the genome of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus. By using an extensive randomization strategy, the entire 3 -bp specificity of a finger has been changed. Rapid analysis of <b>selected</b> zinc <b>fingers</b> was facilitated by the development of an immunoscreening assay for DNA binding and specificity. To investigate the mechanism of binding and specificity, the binding kinetics of Zif 268 and 10 selected variants were determined in real time with an assay based on surface plasmon resonance. Differential mechanisms for sequence-specific recognition were observed. No evidence in support of a single general coding relationship between zinc finger and target DNA sequence was observed.

40|$|Abstract. Three {{dimensional}} solid-fluid interaction {{numerical analysis}} models {{of both the}} finger seal with herringbone-grooved pad and the finger seal with herringbone-grooved rotor were established in order to study the performance of hydrodynamic finger seal. The models investigated fluid radial under pad force and fluid leakage {{as a function of}} both the rotor speed and the high- to low-pressure differential. It was shown that the finger seal with herringbone-grooved structure in pad or in rotor could bring lift force under the finger pad so as to keep the finger seal in non-contacting status. For the two types of finger seal, their load carrying ability and fluid leakage varying with the pressure differential were almost same. In the same velocity of rotor surface, the load carrying capacity of the finger seal with herringbone- grooved rotor was greater and the leakage was less than that of the finger seal with herringbone-grooved pad respectively. With the conditions of rotor structure allowing, it is suggested to <b>select</b> the <b>finger</b> seal with herringbone-grooved rotor first for designing the hydrodynamic finger seal with herringbone-grooved structure...|$|R
