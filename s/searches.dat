40|$|The {{exploratory}} <b>search</b> {{for complex}} <b>search</b> tasks requires an effective <b>search</b> behavior model {{to evaluate and}} predict user <b>search</b> performance. Few studies have investigated the relationship between user <b>search</b> behavior and <b>search</b> performance in exploratory <b>search.</b> This research adopts a mixed approach combining <b>search</b> system development, user <b>search</b> experiment, <b>search</b> query log analysis, and multivariate regression analysis to resolve the knowledge gap. Through this study, it is shown that exploratory <b>search</b> behavior could be featured with long query length, continuous query reformulations, careful <b>search</b> results evaluation and numerous <b>search</b> results click-through. Moreover, a <b>search</b> interaction-performance model has been constructed using multivariate regression analysis. The model evaluation indicates that the <b>search</b> interaction-performance model could effectively evaluate and predict user <b>search</b> performance in exploratory <b>search.</b> Meanwhile, the study has identified two main exploratory <b>search</b> strategies that could guide searchers into the right information: breadth-first and depth-first <b>search</b> strategies. The <b>search</b> interaction-performance model indicates that the breadth-first strategy tends to achieve better <b>search</b> performance than the depth-first strategy. Finally, since <b>search</b> interactions could affect <b>search</b> performance significantly, a real-time interactive <b>search</b> system has been proposed to guide users through different <b>search</b> trails and provide real-time feedback for <b>search</b> interactions {{in order to achieve}} better <b>search</b> performance...|$|R

5|$|Gens {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with the Judenrat and Friend over the Jewish policemen who guarded the gates into the ghetto. The Germans allowed the Jewish policemen to control access to the ghetto and conduct <b>searches</b> for contraband. Gens' policy was that when no Germans were present at the gates, the policemen would do minimal <b>searches</b> and would allow smuggling of food and other necessary items. If Germans were present at the gates, the policemen conducted thorough <b>searches</b> and often beat up attempted smugglers. In Gens' view, if the Germans thought the Jewish policemen were not vigilant enough, the policemen would be replaced by German guards and any opportunity for smuggling would cease. He also claimed that even when the Germans were present, any confiscated items were brought into the ghetto, which {{would not be the}} case if there were German guards at the gates.|$|E

Our findings show that despite the increasing level of interest in multimedia Web <b>search,</b> those few Web <b>search</b> engines offering multimedia Web <b>search,</b> provide limited multimedia <b>search</b> functionality.
