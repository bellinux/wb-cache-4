2500|$|In {{addition}} to the cheeses mentioned above, {{a large number of}} regional cheeses are made on a small scale and are little-known outside their regions or communities. Porta salud is an aged semihard paste cheese, which has a strong flavor and an orange color. Queso jalapeño is a soft cows’ milk cheese with bits of jalapeño chili pepper served cold or melted in quesadillas. Queso criollo is a semifirm pale yellow cheese that is a specialty of Taxco, Guerrero. Queso corazon is a Chiapan cheese, which is a kind of very moist cream cheese. It gets its name because it is traditionally molded into a heart shape, but most modern producers now mold it into a rectangular shape. Queso Zacatecas is an aged cheese which is usually hard on the outside and a little soft on the inside, and white with a tinge of yellow. It is crumbly and cannot be sliced. Instead, it is served grated. Queso molido, also called queso prensado, is sometimes covered in a red chili pepper paste. Costena cheese is a specialty of Guerrero state. The texture of this cheese is crumbly, and it tastes like fresh or slightly soured milk. Normally, it is white in color. [...] "Queso Real del Castillo" [...] is a <b>semi-hard</b> <b>cheese</b> made in the Ojos Negros and Guadalupe valleys east of Ensenada, Baja California.|$|E

40|$|In <b>semi-hard</b> <b>cheeses,</b> the {{pressure}} increase occurring during eye growth can create cracks leading to product downgrading. Rheological properties of <b>semi-hard</b> <b>cheeses</b> were investigated using lubricated squeezing flow (LSF), a test specifically chosen to mimic conditions {{as close as}} possible to the real eye growth in cheese. Flow curves showed a power law profile, characteristic of a shear-thinning behaviour. Moreover, stress/strain curves obtained at a constant biaxial extension rate showed a strain-hardening behaviour. Structural changes in the matrix during eye growth giving higher resistance towards deformation were indicated, and a schematisation of microstructure changes due to eye growth was postulated. Some threshold values were also identified during ripening, such as the biaxial yielding stress and strain; these were not impacted by cheese age or by the anisotropic organisation of the matrix. However, the yielding strain and Young's modulus increased with the biaxial extension rate...|$|R
40|$|A new and {{original}} statistical approach {{was used to}} compare the effectiveness of 4 different methods to analyse aroma compounds of seven different commercial <b>semi-hard</b> <b>cheeses</b> with regard to their orthonasal sensory perception. Four extraction methods were evaluated: Purge and Trap, Artificial Mouth, Solid-Phase Microextraction (SPME) and Solvent-Assisted Flavour Evaporation (SAFE). Among the headspace methods, Artificial Mouth gave the closest representation of the studied product space to the sensory perception one. The SAFE method was complementary to the dynamic headspace methods, as it was very efficient in extracting the heavy molecules but less efficient for extracting the most volatile compounds. SPME and Purge and Trap gave intermediate representations. At the product level, results indicate that carboxylic adds are present in similar amounts in the different commercial marks of <b>semi-hard</b> <b>cheeses,</b> that esters and aldehydes vary in small proportions and that the proportions of sulphur compounds, alcohols and ketones mainly explain the sensory differences between the commercial marks...|$|R

40|$|Curd granule {{junction}} {{patterns in}} hard (Emmentaler, Gruyere, Sbrinz) and <b>semi-hard</b> <b>cheeses</b> (Appenzeller, Tilsiter, Raclette) were visualized on slices and examined using light microscopy and digital image analysis. Horizontal and vertical sections were cut in different zones of the loaves, {{in order to}} obtain information on the orientation of the flattened curd granules. The frequency histograms of the cross section areas could in most cases adequately be described as a log-normal distribution. The median values ranged from 0. 97 to 1. 15 mm 2 and, from 1. 31 to 1. 68 mm 2 for hard and <b>semi-hard</b> <b>cheeses,</b> respectively. An elliptical form factor was used as a measure of the deformation of the granules. The average ratio of the elliptical axes was in the range of 0. 41 to 0. 56 in horizontal and 0. 33 to 0. 48 i n vertical sections. The difference between the form factors in the orthogonal sections was less pronounced in the Appenzeller and Tilsiter cheeses than in the other varieties. Significantly different junction patterns were observed in regions of the edges and sides of the original billets of curd. The micrographs reveal ed interesting features around the eyes and in the cheese rind. Semi-mechanized and traditionally manufactured Appenzeller and Tilsiter cheeses had different curd granule junction patterns, mainly because of different moulding and pressing arrangements...|$|R
30|$|This study {{provides}} an overall analysis on Lactobacillus strains communities in Motal cheese. To {{the best of}} our knowledge, this is the first attempt performed on Motal cheese to isolate and identify Lactobacillus strains communities and detect the presence of bacteriocins in the identified strains. The mean value of LAB in Motal cheese was higher in comparison with other types of traditional raw milk products such as Klila cheese (Guetouache and Guessas 2015). Lactobacilli occurrence is usually higher in ripened <b>semi-hard</b> <b>cheeses.</b> This may also due to the differences in terms of milk quality {{as well as to the}} standardization of manufacturing facilities.|$|R

40|$|Addition of {{probiotic}} bacteria into {{fermented milk}} beverages {{has been the}} subject of many studies, however, addition of these bacteria into cheeses, especially the ones made from ewe’s milk, has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to produce probiotic <b>semi-hard</b> ewe’s <b>cheese</b> with addition of probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB- 12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA- 5. Cheese ripening occurred during 45 days at 13 °C and 85 % of relative humidity. During that period, chemical parameters were determined and microbiological analysis of manufactured probiotic cheeses was performed. Addition of probiotic cultures did not significantly influence the chemical properties and microbiological quality of produced cheeses in comparison with the control cheeses without addition of probiotic cultures. Number of live probiotic bacteria remained at about 106 - 107 CFU/g of probiotic cheeses during 45 days of ripening, which was confirmed by RAPD method. Sensory properties of probiotic <b>semi-hard</b> ewe’s <b>cheese</b> with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB- 12 were similar to those obtained for cheeses without addition of probiotic, while addition of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA- 5 improved the taste of cheeses. Obtained results demonstrated that <b>semi-hard</b> ewe’s <b>cheese</b> can be an effective matrix for addition of probiotic cultures Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB- 12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA- 5...|$|R

5000|$|Svecia is {{produced}} in a fashion typical to many <b>semi-hard</b> <b>cheeses.</b> Milk is pasteurized to 72 C then cooled to around 30 C. Rennet is added to coagulate the milk into curds and lactic acid enzymes are added to replace enzymes and bacteria killed during pasteurization. The curd is cut, stirred, and slowly drained, then heated back up to a temperature near 40 C to drive off more moisture. After salt is added, the curds are packed into moulds, loosely enough to leave the air pockets which make up Svecia's tiny holes. After a soak in brine, bringing the total salt content of the cheese to 1.0 - 1.5 percent by weight, the cheese is aged in a dry environment {{for at least two}} months [...] - [...] sometimes up to more than a year.|$|R
