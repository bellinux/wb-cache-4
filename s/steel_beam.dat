40|$|In this paper, the {{behaviors}} of 14 H-section <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> in fire are investigated. The test is carried out by use of the self-made fire-test furnace. The lengths of beams are 4200 mm and 3600 mm. The temperature field and deflection of beams in fire are measured. The effect of connection, boundary condition and axial restraint on {{the behaviors}} of <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> is also studied. The test indicates that local buckling and lateral torsional buckling of H-section <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> occur in fire. The behaviors of H-section <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> in fire are influenced by connection and axial restraint. When the beams undergo a large deflection, compression force then quickly changes into tension force, which supports the beam and reduces further deflection, and the catenary action takes place. The test results in this paper {{may be used to}} guide the design of this type of <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> in fire...|$|R

25|$|Demolition of the Waldorf–Astoria {{began in}} October 1929, and the {{foundation}} of the Empire State Building was excavated before demolition was even complete. Construction on the building itself started on March 17, 1930, with an average construction rate of one floor per day. A well-coordinated schedule meant that the 86 stories were topped out by September 19 of the same year, with the mast completed by November 21. From that point, interior work proceeded at a quick pace, and the Empire State Building was opened on May 1, 1931, thirteen and a half months after the first <b>steel</b> <b>beam</b> was erected. Despite the publicity surrounding the building's construction, the building's owners failed to make a profit until the early 1950s. However, it has been a popular tourist attraction since opening, with around 4 million visitors to the building's 86th and 102nd floor observatories every year.|$|E
25|$|MD 290's {{timber bridge}} across the Chester River had been {{proposed}} for replacement as early as 1942, and Queen Anne's County requested funds for the 3-year post-war construction program {{be applied to the}} replacement bridge. The new <b>steel</b> <b>beam</b> and concrete bridge at Crumpton was built in 1951 and 1952. The highway from MD 300 to the new Crumpton bridge was reconstructed, widened, and surfaced with bituminous concrete in 1956 and 1957. As part of the relocation and reconstruction of MD 313 at Irelands Corner in 1956 and 1957, the portion of MD 290 between Irelands Corner Road (which became MD 801) and modern MD 313 was constructed. The portion of MD 290 between the Chester River and Irelands Corner Roadexcept for the MD 291 concurrency, which had been reconstructed in 1962 and 1963was resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1971. MD 290's two interchanges with the Blue Star Memorial Highway (originally MD 71 and now US 301) were both built in 1954 and 1955. In both cases, a single bridge was built at each interchange, as the highway was originally built as one carriageway of an ultimate divided highway. The southbound bridge was built at the Kent County interchange in 1962 and 1963 and at the Queen Anne's County junction in 1966 and 1967.|$|E

40|$|Reduced {{beam section}} (RBS) {{is one of}} the {{connection}} types, which is economical and popular for use in steel moment frames in seismic regions. By cutting some portions of the beam flanges near the column face, the RBS connections are designed to form plastic hinge within the RBS zone so that it could enhance the structural seismic performance. However, the <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> with RBS connections have to provide robustness when exposed to fire. Although the responses of ordinary <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> to elevated temperatures have been investigated over the last few decades, there has been very limited research on the behaviour of <b>steel</b> <b>beams,</b> with RBS connections in fire. This study includes a series of numerical analysis, to investigate the high-temperature performance of <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> with RBS connections, compared to the responses of ordinary <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> to fire. Various parameters have been considered, including the types of fire curves, the levels of beam-end restraints and the cutting profiles of the RBS connections. Overall, the deformation shape of RBS beams at high temperature {{is similar to that of}} ordinary <b>steel</b> <b>beams,</b> whereas the RBS beams could have longer period of fire resistance. The cut section actually provides both rotational and axial ductility/deformability to the connection, enhancing its fire resistance. Moreover, the cutting length, proposed by EC 8, is also adequate for fire design. The minimum distance, between the RBS zone and the beam-end, proposed by FEMA- 350 has been shown sufficient...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the Vierendeel mechanism in <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> with circular web openings based on analytical and numerical studies. The current design method is examined in detail with plastic hinges formed at the low moment side (LMS) and the high moment side (HMS) of the web openings separately. A finite element model is then established with both material and geometrical non-linearity so that load redistribution across the web openings may be incorporated. Moreover, the moment capacities of the tee-sections above and below the web openings may be properly evaluated in the presence of co-existing axial and shear forces in the finite element model. The load carrying capacities of typical universal <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> with circular web openings are also presented and discussed. An empirical shear moment interaction curve at the perforated sections is also suggested for practical design of <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> with circular web openings against the Vierendeel mechanism. It is found that shear yielding in <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> with circular web openings is very important as it promotes the plastic hinge formation at the high moment side of the web opening. Such effect is less significant in <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> with rectangular web openings where the bending moment is often dominant...|$|R

40|$|The {{flexural}} behaviour of <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> significantly affects the structural {{performance of the}} steel frame structures. In particular, the flexural overstrength (namely the ratio between the maximum bending moment and the plastic bending strength) that <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> may experience is the key parameter affecting the seismic design of non-dissipative members in moment resisting frames. The {{aim of this study}} is to present a new formulation of flexural overstrength factor for <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> by means of artificial neural network (NN). To achieve this purpose, a total of 141 experimental data samples from available literature have been collected in order to cover different cross-sectional typologies, namely I-H sections, rectangular and square hollow sections (RHS-SHS). Thus, two different data sets for I-H and RHS-SHS <b>steel</b> <b>beams</b> were formed. Nine critical prediction parameters were selected for the former while eight parameters were considered for the latter. These input variables used for the development of the prediction models are representative of the geometric properties of the sections, the mechanical properties of the material and the shear length of the <b>steel</b> <b>beams.</b> The prediction performance of the proposed NN model was also compared with the results obtained using an existing formulation derived from the gene expression modeling.
