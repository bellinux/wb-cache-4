25|$|The test bed, {{known as}} the Bi-mono, was a <b>small</b> <b>tractor</b> {{monoplane}} with a fabric-covered steel-tube construction fuselage and a wooden wing. It had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage while an enclosed cockpit was provided for the pilot. The auxiliary wing {{was attached to the}} top of the cockpit canopy and to the lower wing by interplane struts. Two different upper wings were designed with different wingspans, the shorter wing having the same span as the lower wing. The aircraft was powered by a single de Havilland Gipsy Six engine.|$|E
2500|$|In 1912, a {{team at the}} Royal Aircraft Factory, led by Geoffrey de Havilland, started {{design of}} a single seat scout, or fast {{reconnaissance}} aircraft, the first aircraft in the world specifically designed for this role. The design was a <b>small</b> <b>tractor</b> biplane, and was named the B.S.1 (standing for Blériot Scout) after Louis Blériot, a pioneer of tractor configuration aircraft. It had a wooden monocoque circular section fuselage, and single-bay wings. Lateral control was by wing warping, while the aircraft was initially fitted with [...] a small rudder without a fixed fin (a scaled down version of that fitted to the B.E.3), and a one-piece elevator. It was powered by a two-row, 14-cylinder Gnome rotary engine rated at 100hp (75kW).|$|E

5000|$|It is very {{important}} to have planting equipment that can properly penetrate through the residue, into the soil and prepare a good seedbed. Switching to no-till reduces the maximum amount of power needed from farm tractors, which means that a farmer can farm under no-till with a <b>smaller</b> <b>tractor</b> than under tilling. [...] Using a <b>smaller,</b> lighter <b>tractor</b> has the added benefit of reducing compaction.|$|R
50|$|In the 1940s most farmers would bale hay in {{the field}} with a <b>small</b> <b>tractor</b> with 20 or less horsepower, and the tied bales would be dropped onto the ground as the baler moved through the field.

Unfortunately the tractor stops next to every house whenever it smells food, so Matroskin has to force it to move on a straight line by holding a sausage on a fishing-rod in front of it.|$|E

50|$|During the 60s {{there was}} a Quonset hut for living {{quarters}} and a small shed which housed a diesel generator, a backup generator, fuel, and a <b>small</b> <b>tractor.</b> There was no official landing strip, just a dirt strip for emergencies. Planes landed on the lake using floats {{in the summer and}} skis in winter. There was a very short emergency strip on land, but it was really too short for safety. The main function of the station was to operate a radio beacon (sending WO in Morse Code for radio-location purposes) and a secondary but very important function was to radio weather observations hourly to Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.|$|E
50|$|Although {{satisfactory}} by {{the standards}} of the day, the Boxkite was not capable of much further development and work soon was started on two new designs, a <b>small</b> <b>tractor</b> configuration biplane and a monoplane. Both of these were exhibited at the 1911 Aero Show at Olympia but neither was flown successfully. At this time, both Challenger and Low left the company to join the newly established aircraft division of the armament firm Vickers. Their place was taken by Pierre Prier, the former chief instructor at the Blériot flying school at Hendon: he was later joined by Gordon England. In January 1912, Romanian aircraft engineer Henri Coandă was appointed as the company's chief designer.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the name [...] "Jeep" [...] has been debated for many years. Some people believe [...] "Jeep" [...] is a phonetic {{pronunciation}} of the abbreviation GP, from [...] "General Purpose", that was used {{as part of the}} official Army nomenclature. The first documented use of the word [...] "Jeep" [...] was the name of a character Eugene the Jeep in the Popeye comic strip, known for his supernatural abilities (e.g. walking through walls). It was also the name of a <b>small</b> <b>tractor</b> supplied to the U.S. Army by Minneapolis-Moline in 1937. Whatever the source, the name stuck and on February 13, 1943 Willys-Overland filed a trademark application {{on the use of the}} term [...] "Jeep" [...] with the U.S Patent Office. After several denials by the patent office and appeals by Willys-Overland, the trademark [...] "Jeep" [...] was finally awarded to the company on June 13, 1950.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a market garden {{operation}} in North America might involve one farmer working full-time on two acres (8,000 m²). Most work is done with hand and light power tools, and perhaps a <b>small</b> <b>tractor.</b> Some 20 different crops are planted throughout the season. Hardier plants, like peas, spinach, radish, carrots and lettuce are seeded first, in earlier Spring, followed by main season crops, like tomatoes, potatoes, corn, beans, cucumber, onions, and summer squash. A further planting timed for harvest in the cooler Fall conditions might include more spinach and carrots, winter squash, cabbage, and rutabaga. Harvesting is done at least weekly, by hand, sometimes with part-time help, and produce is sorted, washed and sold fresh at the local farmers' market, and from an on-farm stand. A pick-up truck is used for short distance transport of crops and other farm materials. The workflow is a steady cycle of planting and harvesting right through the growing season, and usually {{comes to an end}} in the cold winter months.|$|E
