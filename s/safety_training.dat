5|$|The {{ability to}} dive and swim {{underwater}} while holding one's breath {{is considered a}} useful emergency skill, {{an important part of}} water sport and Navy <b>safety</b> <b>training,</b> and an enjoyable leisure activity. Underwater diving without breathing apparatus can be categorised as underwater swimming, snorkelling and freediving. These categories overlap considerably. Several competitive underwater sports are practised without breathing apparatus.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} investigation {{concluded that}} the crash was attributable primarily to three factors: Holland's personality and behavior, USAF leaders' delayed or inadequate reactions to earlier incidents involving Holland, and {{the sequence of events}} during the aircraft's final flight. The crash is now used in military and civilian aviation environments as a case study in teaching crew resource management. It is also often used by the U.S. Armed Forces during aviation <b>safety</b> <b>training</b> {{as an example of the}} importance of compliance with safety regulations and correcting the behavior of anyone who violates safety procedures.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety {{presented}} a challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, {{not to mention the}} largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since it did not matter where accidents occurred, this included safety off the job, in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included in job training, and <b>safety</b> <b>training</b> courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic Safety Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road safety record than other towns of comparable size.|$|E

5|$|On 28 October 1999, Minister of Transport Dag Jostein Fjærvoll {{asked the}} {{directors}} of the three involved parties, Osmund Ueland of NSB, Sverre Quale of the inspectorate and Steinar Killi of the National Rail Administration, to meet at his office the following day if the issue was not resolved. The following day, the inspectorate gave permission for the trains to be taken into use, despite noting a series of non-conformities with safety regulations: the inspectorate lacked a list of the train's deviations from the safety regulations; lack of a system to automatically monitor the speed of the trains, particularly when automatic train stop was disconnected; lack of <b>safety</b> <b>training</b> for the crew; lack of an evacuation analysis; and lack of control of the marking of safety equipment. Most of the deviations were to be followed up within two weeks. Quale stated that the deviated issues were of a nature which had not previously been applied to trains and that it was therefore not critical.|$|E

25|$|The city of Rochester is {{protected}} by approximately 500 professional firefighters in the Rochester Fire Department (RFD). The RFD is the third-largest fire department {{in the state of}} New York. It operates from 16 fire stations, located throughout the city, under the command of 2 Battalion Chiefs and a Deputy Chief per shift. The RFD operates 13 engines, six trucks, one heavy rescue, two hazardous material units, and a salvage unit (Rochester Protectives), as well as many other special and support units. There are 87 line division members working each shift, including chief officers & fire investigation (not including staff divisions such as Fire Safety, the Training Academy and Supply Depot). The RFD responds to around 40,000 emergency calls annually. Approximately 90% of RFD personnel are certified NY State EMTs and approximately 50% of the calls each year are for EMS. The RFD also operates its own apparatus repair division located at the Public <b>Safety</b> <b>Training</b> Facility. The current Chief of Department is John P. Schreiber.|$|E

25|$|After {{some time}} {{the reason for}} the {{presence}} of voluntary police officers had changed. No longer were these men and women called into service only for emergencies. More and more they became part of the regular teams of police officers and started doing all sorts of regular police tasks. As of 1994, along with the first great reform of the Dutch police, police volunteers were fully integrated into the 25 regional police forces. Between 1994 and 2010, new voluntary police officers were no longer equipped with a pistol. Those who started before 1994 were allowed to keep their pistol, as long as they kept up training. Since 2005, all voluntary police officers are equipped with pepper spray. As of today, voluntary police officers are again equipped with a pistol, after having acquired a full police diploma, successfully completed several years of field-experience as an unarmed officer, and completed an additional police <b>safety</b> <b>training.</b> In 2012 the initial training program for new voluntary police officers was changed, reducing the training from three years down to one year. Dutch voluntary police officers hold the same police powers and wear the same uniform as their professional counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Later {{investigations}} discovered problems {{concerning the}} state of Sewol {{at the time of}} departure. The Safety Investigation Report made by the Korea Maritime Safety Tribunal noted that Sewol at the time of departure was carrying 2,142.7 tons of cargo when its maximum allowance was 987 tons. TIME magazine further noted that the cargo had been improperly secured. The Report also noted that only 761.2 tons of ballast were taken on board, that some ballast tanks had not been properly maintained, and that the last voyage was made without making further adjustments to the ballast during the journey. Kukmin Ilbo reported that Captain Shin, the regular captain of Sewol, had warned the company about the decrease in stability and passenger satisfaction and attributed it to the removal of the side ramp. However, Captain Shin claimed that the company responded with threats to fire him if he continued his objections. Captain Shin's warnings were also relayed through an official working for the Incheon Port Authority on 9 April 2014, which an official from the company responded to by stating that he would deal with anyone making the claims. The Korea Herald also reported that the captain had requested a repair for the malfunctioning steering gear on 1 April 2014, which was not done. The Daily Telegraph reported that the Korean Register of Shipping had noted in a stability test report dated 24 January 2014 that Sewol had become 'top heavy and less stable after modifications were made.' The New York Times reported that the company budget for the <b>safety</b> <b>training</b> of the crew was $2 USD, which was used to buy a paper certificate.|$|E
