2500|$|Altitude {{acclimatization}} is {{the process}} of adjusting to decreasing oxygen levels at higher elevations, in order to avoid altitude sickness. Once above approximately a pressure of most climbers and high-altitude trekkers take the [...] "climb-high, sleep-low" [...] approach. For high-altitude climbers, a typical acclimatization regimen might be to stay a few days at a base camp, climb up to a higher camp (slowly), and then return to base camp. A subsequent climb to the higher camp then includes an overnight stay. This process is then repeated a few times, each time extending the time spent at higher altitudes to let the body adjust to the oxygen level there, a process that involves the production of additional red blood cells.

Data for these two engines are presented to show the effect of altitude, free-stream ram-pressure ratio, and tail-pipe-nozzle area on engine performance. A 21 -percent reduction in tail-pipe-nozzle area of the 19 B- 8 engine increased the let thrust 43 percent the net thrust 72 percent, and the fuel consumption 64 percent. An increase in free-stream ram-pressure ratio raised the jet thrust and the air flow and lowered the net thrust throughout {{the entire range of}} engine speeds for the 19 B- 8 engine. At similar operating conditions, the corrected jet thrust and corrected air flow were approximately the same for both engines, and the corrected specific fuel consumption based on jet thrust was lower for the 19 XB- 1 engine than for the 19 B- 8 engine.

50|$|In 1953, Avro Canada {{once again}} turned to Orenda {{to produce an}} engine for the CF-105 Arrow project. Avro had {{originally}} intended {{to use one of}} three different engines from the UK (one produced under license in the US), but all of these projects ran into delays. Orenda quickly responded with the PS.13 Iroquois design. Once again Orenda was able to prototype the new engine {{in a short period of}} time, starting development in 1953, completing it in May 1954 and building and running the prototype by December 1954. During the testing period, the Iroquois was the most powerful jet engine in the world, rated at 19,250 lbf (85.6 kN) dry, 25,000 lbf (111 kN) afterburning. It was aerodynamically matched for peak performance at 50,000 feet (15,200 m) altitude and Mach 2 speed. After some 7,000 hours of development testing, up to a <b>simulated</b> <b>altitude</b> of 70,000 feet (21,300 m) and a forward speed of Mach 2.3, the Iroquois program was cancelled, along with the Arrow on 20 February 1959.|$|E
40|$|Intermittent hypoxic {{exposure}} (IHE) {{has been}} shown to induce aspects of altitude acclimatization which affect ventilatory, cardiovascular and metabolic responses during exercise in normoxia and hypoxia. However, knowledge on altitude-dependent effects and possible interactions remains scarce. Therefore, we determined the effects of IHE on cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses at different <b>simulated</b> <b>altitudes</b> in the same healthy subjects. Eight healthy male volunteers participated in the study and were tested before and 1 to 2 days after IHE (7 × 1 hour at 4500 m). The participants cycled at 2 submaximal workloads (corresponding to 40 % and 60 % of peak oxygen uptake at low <b>altitude)</b> at <b>simulated</b> <b>altitudes</b> of 2000 m, 3000 m, and 4000 m in a randomized order. Gas analysis was performed and arterial oxygen saturation, blood lactate concentrations, and blood gases were determined during exercise. Additionally baroreflex sensitivity, hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory response were determined before and after IHE. Hypoxic ventilatory response was increased after IHE (p< 0. 05). There were no altitude-dependent changes by IHE in any of the determined parameters. However, blood lactate concentrations and carbon dioxide output were reduced; minute ventilation and arterial oxygen saturation were unchanged, and ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide was increased after IHE irrespective of altitude. Changes in hypoxic ventilatory response were associated with changes in blood lactate (r = - 0. 72, p< 0. 05). Changes in blood lactate correlated with changes in carbon dioxide output (r = 0. 61, p< 0. 01) and minute ventilation (r = 0. 54, p< 0. 01). Based on the present results it seems that the reductions in blood lactate and carbon dioxide output have counteracted the increased hypoxic ventilatory response. As a result minute ventilation and arterial oxygen saturation did not increase during submaximal exercise at <b>simulated</b> <b>altitudes</b> between 2000 m and 4000 m...|$|R

50|$|An {{investigation}} into the failure concluded that it was most likely caused by design modifications to the GATV versus a standard Agena D stage. The Agena D was designed to have its engine restarted just once while the GATV {{would need to be}} restarted five times. While a standard Agena D pumped oxidizer into the combustion chamber first and then followed with the fuel, the GATV was modified to do the reverse because the normal start method had a tendency to leak oxidizer. While this would not be a problem for the Agena D with its single restart, the multi-restart GATV would eventually lose all of its oxidizer before the stage's operating life (which would last weeks instead of hours) could be completed. Unfortunately, pumping the fuel into the combustion chamber first caused the engine to backfire and rupture from mechanical shock. It was found out that Lockheed engineers did not properly test the GATV to root out this problem (it had been tested at a <b>simulated</b> <b>altitude</b> of 21 miles up when actual Agena engine start would occur at around 75 miles up). The solution to the problem was switching back to the normal oxidizer-first engine start and also testing the GATV in appropriate conditions. Bell Aerosystems, the manufacturer of the Agena's engine, were also instructed to perform further ground-level tests.|$|E
