One major difference between these negotiations and those of 1952, was the stance of the Iraqi government.

40|$|Abstract- As {{the world}} becomes more globalized and {{resources}} become more internationally mobile, {{the issue of}} tax competition is moving {{to the forefront of}} debates surrounding national tax systems. Those who have studied taxation in a federal system of govern-ment will recognize that this debate <b>is</b> <b>not</b> new. This paper presents the conceptual issues that have arisen concerning tax competition in the fiscal federalism literature, and explores the reasons why the empirical measurement of the effects of tax competition, particularly corporate tax competition, is so difficult. Given the complicated nature of the problem and the theoreti-cal ambiguity on the consequences of tax competition, it <b>should</b> perhaps <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> for the empirical literature to find that competition sometimes increases and sometimes decreases tax rates...|$|R
2500|$|Noting {{that the}} array of curses in [...] dwarf the {{catalogue}} of blessings preceding them, the 20th century Reform Rabbi Gunther Plaut argued that this imbalance <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprising,</b> for specific negative commandments far outnumber specific positive ones in the Torah, and forbidden behaviors were generally more common in law codes. Plaut taught that the Torah promises and threatens based on the realistic assumption that, while pure love of God and the commandments is the highest rung, such devotion {{for its own sake}} can be scaled only by the very few, while the majority will need earthly rewards and punishments held up before their eyes. Plaut reported general scholarly agreement that the vassal treaties of the Assyrian King Esarhaddon influenced these curses. Noting that in the Assyrian model, the suzerain lays down conditions and states what he will do if the vassal complies or fails to comply, Plaut concluded that the Torah's adoption of this treaty form can be seen as part of the Torah's ever-present view of Israel as a covenanted community.|$|E

The wording of the resolution by the Fatah movement was crafted {{in such a way as}} to bring states doubtful of a vote to either support it or at least abstain. The draft does not state a recognition of Palestine under the 1967 borders, but instead asks for permanent borders to be negotiated based on the principle of the 4 June 1967; a move that even elicited the support of some members of the rival Palestinian movement Hamas, who has previously said that recognition of the 1967 borders before a final-status deal would mean waiving the claim for the right of return of refugees. On 15 September, a senior Palestinian diplomat said that [...] "we will make the final decision soon" [...] when disputed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas [...] "announce the final decision."
