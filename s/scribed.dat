5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls <b>scribed</b> with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E

25|$|Calligraphy {{is central}} in Tibetan culture. The script {{is derived from}} Indic scripts. The nobles of Tibet, such as the High Lamas and {{inhabitants}} of the Potala Palace, were usually capable calligraphers. Tibet has been a center of Buddhism for several centuries, and that religion places {{a great deal of}} significance on written word. This does not provide for a large body of secular pieces, although they do exist (but are usually related in some way to Tibetan Buddhism). Almost all high religious writing involved calligraphy, including letters sent by the Dalai Lama and other religious and secular authority. Calligraphy is particularly evident on their prayer wheels, although this calligraphy was forged rather than <b>scribed,</b> much like Arab and Roman calligraphy is often found on buildings. Although originally done with a reed, Tibetan calligraphers now use chisel tipped pens and markers as well.|$|E
25|$|To {{the upper}} right of the horse, a frightened female figure, {{who seems to be}} {{witnessing}} the scenes before her, appears to have floated into the room through a window. Her arm, also floating in, carries a flame-lit lamp. The lamp is positioned very close to the bulb, and is a symbol of hope, clashing with the lightbulb. From the right, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center below the floating female figure. She looks up blankly into the blazing light bulb. Daggers that suggest screaming replace the tongues of the bull, grieving woman, and horse. A dove is <b>scribed</b> on the wall behind the bull. Part of its body comprises a crack in the wall through which bright light (hope, or the outside world) can be seen. On the far right, a woman with arms raised in terror is entrapped by fire from above and below; her right hand suggests the shape of an airplane. A dark wall with an open door defines the right end of the mural.|$|E

500|$|<b>Scribe</b> B {{was a poor}} speller, and <b>scribe</b> A was {{not very}} much better; the best <b>scribe</b> was D. Metzger states: [...] "scribe A had made some unusually serious mistakes". <b>Scribes</b> A and B more often used nomina sacra in {{contracted}} forms (ΠΝΕΥΜΑ contracted in all occurrences, ΚΥΡΙΟΣ contracted except in 2 occurrences), <b>scribe</b> D more often used forms uncontracted. D distinguished between sacral and nonsacral using of ΚΥΡΙΟΣ. His errors are the substitution of ΕΙ for Ι, and Ι for ΕΙ in medial positions, both equally common. Otherwise substitution of Ι for initial ΕΙ is unknown, and final ΕΙ is only replaced in word ΙΣΧΥΕΙ, confusing of Ε and ΑΙ is very rare. In the Book of Psalms this <b>scribe</b> has 35 times ΔΑΥΕΙΔ instead of ΔΑΥΙΔ, while <b>scribe</b> A normally uses an abbreviated form ΔΑΔ. <b>Scribe</b> A's was a [...] "worse type of phonetic error".

500|$|The church {{struggled}} {{to eliminate the}} pagan habits of leaving grave goods except for the clothing and usual jewellry of the powerful, especially rings. [...] Kings might be buried with a sceptre, and bishops with a crozier, their respective symbols of office. [...] The 7th-century Stonyhurst Gospel, with a unique Insular original leather binding, was recovered from St Cuthbert's coffin, itself a significant object; it was probably Cuthbert's personal copy, which he had very likely <b>scribed</b> himself. [...] The armour and sword of a knight might be hung over his tomb, {{as those of the}} Black Prince still are in Canterbury Cathedral. The Early Christian Church, to the frustration of historians of costume, encouraged burial in a plain white winding-sheet, as being all that would be required at the Second Coming. [...] For centuries, most except royalty followed this custom, which at least kept clothing, which was very expensive for rich and poor alike, available {{for the use of the}} living. [...] The use of a rich cloth pall to cover the coffin during the funeral grew during the Middle Ages; initially these were brightly coloured and patterned, only later black. [...] They were usually then given to the Church to use for vestments or other decorations.|$|E

Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker thought Anna Torv's Nimoy impression was [...] "aces, very wry and amusing," [...] and also praised Joshua Jackson's acting {{in response to}} it. Like Tucker, Noel Murray from The A.V. Club also praised Torv and Jackson's performances, and graded the episode with a B+, explaining it [...] "was an effective episode despite all its metaphysical mumbo-jumbo [...] Dana's predicament was a legitimately tense one... As she stepped on the train, I didn't {{know if she was}} planning to save the passengers or send their souls a-scattering... the suspense itself was palpable". Murray however admitted that [...] "if the [...] "villain" [...] weren't so sympathetic, or if the action weren't so breathless, or if I didn't find the Bellivia material so funny, I'd probably be annoyed by the wacky way the Fringe writers have found to bring William Bell back." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times noted of Torv that her [...] "cadence of her words was dead on, and his/her interactions with everyone else in Fringe Division were pitch perfect." [...] He praised other facets of the episode, including how [...] "the weekly mysteries unfold like origami", and that introducing the prime's version of the Lincoln character allowed the audience [...] "to see all the weirdness of Fringe through fresh eyes".|$|E

According to Rachel's original character description, written by Crane and Kauffman themselves for the show's pilot, the character is a spoiled yet courageous young woman who [...] "has worked for none of what she has", unlike best friend Monica, and is initially [...] "equipped to do nothing". James Endrst of the Hartford Courant identified her as [...] "a spoiled rich kid", while the Daily News dubbed Rachel an [...] "endearingly spoiled Daddy's girl." [...] Author Kim Etingoff wrote about Rachel in her book Jennifer Aniston: From Friends to Films [...] that the character is [...] "spunky and sometimes spoiled", while TV Land called her [...] "naive." [...] Citing the differences between Rachel and her two female friends, The Guardians Ryan Gilbey observed that the character [...] "wasn't insulated by self-regard, like Monica, or swaddled in gormlessness, like Phoebe." [...] Frequently identified as fitting the [...] "girl next door" [...] archetype, Anne Bilson of The Telegraph described Rachel as [...] "funny but not too funny, pretty but not too pretty, sexy but not too sexy, scatterbrained but not too scatterbrained." [...] TalkTalk's Dominic Wills described the character as [...] "smart but ditzy, determined but undisciplined."

40|$|Thin film {{technology}} offers a promising development toward more economic solar electricity. A key step in thin-film module production is the isolative laser <b>scribing</b> of metal back contact layers on glass substrates. Successful <b>scribing</b> yields reproducible, clean <b>scribes</b> without buckling, ridges or collars on the <b>scribe</b> edges. It is also desirable that <b>scribes</b> are narrow, to minimise loss of active solar cell area, {{and that they}} can be processed rapidly. During this investigation laser <b>scribing</b> of a Mo back contact layer for solar module production has been considered for optimisation. The laser system used is a lamp-pumped, green solid-state Nd:YAG laser, operating at 532 nm output wavelength. This system has been characterized {{in order to determine the}} output energy, laser spot size and average energy density. <b>Scribing</b> results have been evaluated qualitatively for different laser parameters. Furthermore, <b>scribing</b> has been evaluated on Mo that has been deposited under different conditions. Using a double lens configuration has been evaluated for the possibility of, by simple optical manipulation, affecting the <b>scribe</b> quality and width. Using the results from the qualitative investigation of laser <b>scribing</b> a standard process for module fabrication has been established, providing clean, reproducible <b>scribes</b> with little or no buckling of the <b>scribe</b> edges. It has also been shown that these laser <b>scribing</b> parameters yielded good results across a range of Mo sputtered under different pressures. Finally it has been shown that the <b>scribe</b> width can be reduced, in this case from 70 µm to 50 µm, using the double lens configuration. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

Hal Hinson of The Washington Post described Belle as a [...] "compelling" [...] character who is [...] "more mature, more womanly and less blandly asexual" [...] than Ariel, as well as [...] "a more worldly girl", describing her as [...] "a bookworm, with gumption and a mind of her own." [...] Similarly comparing Belle to Ariel, John Hartl of The Seattle Times wrote that, in Beauty and the Beast, [...] "there's rarely a sense of deja vu, perhaps because the heroine is so different from 'Mermaid's' dependent Ariel, and her dilemma is more poignant," [...] while Boxoffice <b>scribed,</b> [...] "Undoubtedly in response to criticism that the cute little 'Mermaid' Ariel {{was nothing more than}} a precocious sexpot, the idea-people behind this beauty—aptly named Belle ... chose to make her an icon of self-reliance and a voracious reader with a curiosity and love for everything around her." [...] Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail extolled Belle as a [...] "smart, courageous ... 'take-charge kind of gal'," [...] while crowning her the [...] "main attraction of Beauty and the Beast." [...] Emma Cochrane of Empire hailed Belle as [...] "a feminist heroine who [...] more rounded than previous Disney characters", while Paste's Annlee Ellingson similarly enjoyed the character's [...] "feminist kick." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun wrote that [...] "Belle ... is no passive fairy tale princess, but a real live girl, with a spunky personality and her own private agenda." [...] TV Guide wrote that [...] "The familiar narrative is strengthened by the independent, self-assured character of Belle," [...] concluding, [...] "Unlike Disney heroines from Snow White through Ariel, Belle is smart, knows what she wants, and doesn't spend her time pining away for the love of a handsome prince." [...] Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly praised Belle's heroism, dubbing her [...] "the hero" [...] of Beauty and the Beast, while Entertainment Weekly's Christian Blauvelt opined, [...] "Unlike previous Disney heroines who needed to be rescued by a prince themselves, Belle not only saves the Beast's life, she saves his soul." [...] TLC's Vicki Arkoff received Belle as a [...] "smart" [...] and [...] "sharp-tongued" [...] heroine, crediting the character for [...] "break Disney's passive-princess mold." [...] About.com's David Nusair described Belle as an [...] "admirable" [...] heroine. AllMovie's Don Kaye and Perry Seibert echoed each other's reviews of the character, with Kaye describing both Belle and the Beast as [...] "three-dimensional ... complex individuals who defy stereotyping and change over the course of the story," [...] and Seibert calling Belle a [...] "strong female character" [...] who [...] "sidesteps most of the clichés surrounding Disney heroines."
