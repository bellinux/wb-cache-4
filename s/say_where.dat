5|$|Conwell {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on December 2, 1820. The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy that preceded Conwell's arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, William Hogan, {{approached}} de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia. After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan {{was assigned to}} St. Mary's Church. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy. Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already {{moved out of the}} priests' residence at Old St. Joseph's Church to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to <b>say</b> <b>where</b> he should live.|$|E
5|$|After Wilfrid's {{return to}} Northumbria in about 658, Cenwalh, King of Wessex, {{recommended}} Wilfrid to Alhfrith, Oswiu's son, as a cleric well-versed in Roman customs and liturgy. Alhfrith was a sub-king of Deiria under his father's rule, {{and the most}} likely heir to his father's throne as his half-brothers were still young. Shortly before 664 Alhfrith gave Wilfrid a monastery he had recently founded at Ripon, formed around a group of monks from Melrose Abbey, followers of the Irish monastic customs. Wilfrid ejected the abbot, Eata, because he would not follow the Roman customs; Cuthbert, later a saint, was another of the monks expelled. Wilfrid introduced the Rule of Saint Benedict into Ripon, claiming {{that he was the}} first person in England to make a monastery follow it, but this claim rests on the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi and does not <b>say</b> <b>where</b> Wilfrid became knowledgeable about the Rule, nor exactly what form of the Rule was being referred to. Shortly afterwards Wilfrid was ordained a priest by Agilbert, Bishop of Dorchester in the kingdom of the Gewisse, part of Wessex. Wilfrid was a protégé of Agilbert, who later helped in Wilfrid's consecration as a bishop. The monk Ceolfrith was attracted to Ripon from Gilling Abbey, which had recently been depopulated {{as a result of the}} plague. Ceolfrith later became Abbot of Wearmouth-Jarrow during the time the medieval chronicler and writer Bede was a monk there. Bede hardly mentions the relationship between Ceolfrith and Wilfrid, but it was Wilfrid who consecrated Ceolfrith a priest and who gave permission for him to transfer to Wearmouth-Jarrow.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} New Jersey Casino Expansion Amendment {{resulted from}} an agreement among Gov. Chris Christie and Democratic state legislators. State legislators were in deadlock over {{who would be}} allowed to own new casinos and tax revenue sharing. The measure does not <b>say</b> <b>where</b> the casinos would be allowed. Location and other matters such as tax rates would be determined by enabling legislation to be passed by the state legislature. A law passed by popular vote in 1976 gives Atlantic City a monopoly on casino gambling in New Jersey.|$|E

25|$|In {{systematic}} chemical nomenclature, alkynes {{are named}} with the Greek prefix system without any additional letters. Examples include ethyne or octyne. In parent chains with {{four or more}} carbons, {{it is necessary to}} <b>say</b> <b>where</b> the triple bond is located. For octyne, one can either write 3-octyne or oct-3-yne when the bond starts at the third carbon. The lowest number possible is given to the triple bond. When no superior functional groups are present, the parent chain must include the triple bond even if it is not the longest possible carbon chain in the molecule. Ethyne is commonly called by its trivial name acetylene.|$|E
25|$|After {{selling his}} house in Raheny, in 1969 Haughey bought Abbeville, located at Kinsealy in north County Dublin, an {{historic}} house once owned by Anglo-Irish politician John Beresford for whom it had been extensively re-designed by the architect James Gandon in the late 18th century. Haughey purchased its existing estate of approximately 250 acres at the same time; it became his family home and he lived there {{for the rest of}} his life. This marked the beginning of a long period when Haughey's spending was well beyond his income level. For the rest of his life Haughey would refuse to <b>say</b> <b>where</b> the extra money came from.|$|E

25|$|Olkar {{wants to}} seize the diadem of Vishnu, the great {{treasure}} of Benares, but Démaly refuses to <b>say</b> <b>where</b> it is hidden. Olkar places Laméa in Démaly's prison cell, hoping she will lure him into revealing the location. Instead, she tells Démaly that an army of rescuers {{is on its way}} from Ellabad. The bayaderes also have a plan to trick the Mahrattas. She tells Olkar she knows where the diadem is but will only bring it to him after a victory celebration in Benares. The festivities take place and the bayaderes lull the Mahrattas with their dancing and intoxicating drinks and secretly take away their weapons. Laméa now gives the signal for the rescuing army to attack. Led by Démaly, who has been freed from prison, they defeat the Mahrattas.|$|E
25|$|After Ayres's {{division}} {{had captured}} the return, Warren again went {{to search for}} Crawford. He found Crawford's division in good order {{on the east side}} of the Boisseau farm, facing west. Unfortunately for Warren, Sheridan asked for Warren at about this time and no one could <b>say</b> <b>where</b> he was. Sheridan then ordered Griffin to take command of the corps. Meanwhile, Warren ordered Crawford to wheel to the left and drive south against Five Forks because Warren perceived that the Confederates still held the crossroads because of artillery fire coming from that direction. Coulter's brigade led the attack on the left of Ford's Road with Kellogg's and Baxter's brigades and four of Bartlett's separated regiments coming up on the right. From woods on the south of the Boisseau farm, the Confederates fired steadily on the Union battle line. Three companies of the 1st Maine Veteran Infantry Regiment routed a patrol of Rosser's cavalry across Hatcher's Run before rejoining their regiment. Warren assigned the 1st Maine Veteran Infantry Regiment and the 118th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment to watch the ford across Hatcher's Run.|$|E
25|$|During {{a search}} among Mrs McGinty's possessions, Poirot finds a {{newspaper}} from which an {{article has been}} cut out. The newspaper is dated {{a few days before}} the murder. He later discovers that the missing article is about women connected with famous murder cases, and includes photographs of them. He also discovers that Mrs McGinty had purchased a bottle of ink in a local shop shortly before her murder. He concludes that she had recognised one of the women in the article, and had written to the paper in question. Someone must have found out about it and then killed her to prevent her from talking. Poirot and Spence, using the ages of people in the town, conclude that someone is either Lily Gamboll, who committed murder with a meat cleaver as a child, or Eva Kane, who had been the love interest who inspired a man to murder his wife and bury her in a cellar. Another possibility is that someone is Evelyn Hope, the daughter of Eva Kane. Shortly afterwards, Poirot discovers the murder weapon, a sugar hammer, left around in plain sight at his boarding house and accessible to all the suspects. In an attempt to flush out the murderer, Poirot claims to know more than he does and is nearly pushed under an oncoming train. Poirot decides to show most of the suspects the photos at a party. Mrs Upward claims to have seen the photo of Lily Gamboll, but does not <b>say</b> <b>where.</b>|$|E

25|$|Troubled {{by family}} upsets, Frank is devastated in 1990 {{when his mother}} Mo (Edna Dore) {{develops}} dementia. Her deterioration is rapid. In a lucid moment, she writes Frank a letter asking him not to let her end up like her grandmother, who had gone senile, saying she would rather die than suffer the same fate. Frank is torn, but attempts to adhere to his mother's wish by almost smothering her with a pillow while she sleeps. However, he cannot {{go through with it}} and instead sends Mo to live with his sister Joan Garwood (Mary Miller) in Colchester. In 1992 Frank receives a huge tax demand, swiftly followed by a large VAT bill. This forces him to sell his B and the adjoining house and move his family into a small flat. Pat establishes her own cab firm, PatCabs, which starts making them some money. However, on Christmas Eve that year, Pat runs over and kills a teenage girl and is later sentenced to six months in prison. Frank struggles alone and the Butchers end 1993 in financial ruin. In desperation, Frank asks Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) to set fire to his car lot so he can claim on insurance in March 1994. The car lot catches fire as agreed, but unknown to Phil and Frank, a homeless man is sleeping in one of the cars and burns to death. Frank is arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, but is later released due to lack of evidence. However, doubts remain as to whether he conspired to defraud his insurance company and an investigation takes place. Frank tries covering his tracks by claiming his accounts have burnt but Pat gives the business's books to the investigating agent. The pressure becomes too much for Frank, who is suffering severe guilt over the death of the homeless man. He becomes so depressed and despondent, no one can get through to him. Unable to cope, Frank leaves Walford and his family without warning in April 1994, and does not contact them to <b>say</b> <b>where</b> he is.|$|E

500|$|The {{funds for}} the {{dividend}} payment were raised by a debenture of £50,000. By the end of 1890 many City figures were suspicious of the Hansard Union, and were calling it [...] "Bottomley's swindle". Despite Bottomley's outward optimism, in December 1890 the company defaulted on the payment of debenture interest and in May 1891, amid growing rumours of insolvency, the debenture holders petitioned for the company's compulsory winding-up. In the same month Bottomley, who had taken at least £100,000 from the company, filed a petition for bankruptcy. Under examination by the Official Receiver, he could not <b>say</b> <b>where</b> the money had gone, and professed total ignorance of the company's book-keeping. After further enquiries, the Board of Trade instituted prosecutions for fraud against Bottomley, Isaacs and two others.|$|E
500|$|After {{two more}} EPs on Kompakt, the Orb (now {{composed}} of only Paterson and Fehlmann) released Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt, which featured new material {{in addition to}} tweaked versions of their previous Kompakt output. By this stage, Allmusic observed, Thomas Fehlmann had become the primary creative figure in the Orb, [...] "inhibiting Alex Paterson's whimsical impulses". Because of this, Okie Dokie was considerably more focused and less [...] "goofy" [...] than Cydonia and Bicycles & Tricycles. Fehlmann's trademark hypnotic loops and delays made him the centre of Okie Dokie production and, according to Pitchfork Media, made it [...] "difficult to <b>say</b> <b>where</b> [...] is in the picture". The Orb's releases with Kompakt gained them back much of their musical credibility with the press and showed that they could [...] "age gracefully".|$|E

The chancel was about [...] long, and the nave was small, taking up only about [...] of the building's overall length.

The size of the community this church was originally built to serve is unknown, although Domesday Book records the presence of 90villeins and 25bordars in the manor of Reculver in 1086, which included land on the Isle of Thanet, but consisted mainly of land in mainland Kent. Those numbers can be multiplied four or five times to account for dependants, since they only represent adult male heads of households; Domesday Book does not <b>say</b> <b>where</b> in the manor they lived.|$|E

[...] Before their association with Jackson, Jam and Lewis had originally planned to record an album with tracks they wrote for Sharon Bryant, but she found their lyrics and sound to be too [...] "rambunctious". The duo presented the same set of recordings to Jackson, who gave her input and took co-writing and co-production credits for the album's content. Jam and Lewis recalled that in order to collaborate with Jackson on the material, they spent the first week simply getting to know their new client. Lewis explained, [...] "We got into her head.
