The average shell thickness of the white <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> (. 390 mm) was significantly thicker than the brown <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> (. 368 mm). The white <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> had a significantly higher average shell weight (5. 62 vs. 5. 30) and contained a significantly greater percentage of shell (9. 35 vs. 8. 65) than the brown <b>shell</b> <b>eggs.</b> The white <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> had a significantly greater shell weight per unit surface area (72. 97 vs. 78. 43 mg/cm 2) than the brown <b>shell</b> <b>eggs.</b> (Key words: brown <b>shell</b> <b>eggs,</b> white <b>shell</b> <b>eggs,</b> <b>shell</b> quality, shell weight) 1985 Poultry Science 64 : 297 - 30...|$|R

This protolacteal fluid became a complex, nutrient-rich milk which then allowed a decline in egg size by reducing the dependence on a large yolk in the egg.20 The evolution of lactation is also believed to have resulted in the more complex dentition seen in mammals, as lactation would have allowed the prolonged development of the jaw before the eruption of teeth.|$|E

50|$|Pasteurizing <b>eggs</b> {{in their}} <b>shells</b> is {{achieved}} through {{a technique that}} uses precise time and temperature zones within water baths. Pasteurizing <b>eggs</b> in their <b>shells</b> can also be achieved through a process that involves treatment with ozone and reactive oxygen species under high and low pressures, followed by replacement with an inert gas, such as nitrogen. Currently, <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> pasteurized using the heating technique are the only commercially available pasteurized eggs. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, “Shell eggs can be pasteurized by a processor if FDA accepted the process {{for the destruction of}} Salmonella. Pasteurized <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> are now available at some grocery stores and must be kept refrigerated to retain quality.

50|$|The {{patterns}} of autoinfection highlight mother-son mating and the sex ratio. Female biased broods are favored, involving mother-son matings and accessibility to haplodiploids. Colonization {{is accomplished by}} immature stages and female bias is favored at low colonization densities by the fact that, unlike isolated males, isolated females are not lost to the gene pool because they can mate with their parthenogenetically produced sons. In the M. Adamson and D. Ludwig model, colonization was found to occur before mating and male progeny have no fitness unless they colonize a host that contains a female. The ability of a female to produce songs with which to mate is potentially central to the colonization process. This conclusion was specifically called to attention through the case of G. batrachiensis. Using, in pinworms, mother-son matings {{are not expected to}} occur commonly in this life cycle since a female's progeny must leave the host. However, in G. batrachiensis, a second mode of reproduction has developed that makes mother-son matings possible: the method by which females produce two types of eggs, thin and thick shelled, as explored in detail in the earlier sections of this article. Once again, thin-shelled eggs contain well developed larvae that hatch at deposition and develop in the same host as the mother; thick <b>shelled</b> <b>eggs</b> are deposited in the two to four stage of cleavage and must pass to the external environment before they are infective. The colonizing period in G. batrachiensis lasts about three months. During a three year study, the number of adult worms in hosts in late fall varied between 3 and 12. If colonization is assumed to be a random process, then the mean interval between colonizations varied between 9 and 35 days with a mean of 17, which corresponds to the period a female requires to reach reproductive age. Hence, early colonists may often reach reproductive maturity in isolation from others of the opposite sex even though, {{by the end of the}} colonization period, hosts typically contain a dozen worms. Males mature about twice as fast as females, and this lessens the delay in reproduction associated with mating with a son. Brood sex ratio is skewed in G. batrachiensis. In a sample of 234 females, 205 of 296 embryos in thick-shelled eggs were diploid and would develop as females.|$|E

Two trays each containing 30 eggs from each egg color were randomly collected from supermarket, three times at different time intervals. The eggs of each collection were randomly divided into three groups of 20 eggs. The different egg groups were individually weighed and stored in refrigerator for 0, 10 and 20 days at 7 °C and 60 % relative humidity. Egg air cell depth (AC), shape index (SI) and specific gravity (SG) were measured {{for all of the}} eggs in each group. Blood (BS) and meat (MS) spots, Haugh unit values (HU), yolk color grade (C), shell weight (SW), shell thickness (ST), egg surface area (SA), shell density (SD) and shell weight per unit of egg surface area (SWUSA) of each individual eggs were measured. The results shows that white shell eggs had significantly higher weight, surface area and lower shape index and blood spot incidence. Storage period had a significant (P<. 05) adverse effect upon Haugh unit values, specific gravity, air cell depth and shell thickness but a positive effect upon shell density and shell weight per unit of surface area of brown and white <b>shelled</b> <b>eggs</b> but Haugh unit values of white <b>shelled</b> <b>eggs</b> were more adversely affected by prolonged storage period.
