With the ability to generate a large amount of data per experiment, genome-scale RNAi screening has led to an explosion data generation rates. Exploiting such large data sets is a fundamental challenge, requiring suitable statistics/bioinformatics methods. The basic process of cell-based RNAi screening includes the choice of an RNAi library, robust and stable cell types, transfection with RNAi agents, treatment/incubation, <b>signal</b> <b>detection,</b> analysis and identification of important genes or therapeutical targets.|$|E

Compared to the existing P 1 -symbol based preamble for the second generation digital terrestrial television broadcasting standard, the proposed design maintains the high performance and robustness in timing and carrier frequency offset estimation while significantly reducing the <b>signalling</b> <b>detection</b> complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed preamble achieves a better <b>signalling</b> <b>detection</b> performance than the standardized P 1 symbol design...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{iterative}} channel estimation and OFDM <b>signals</b> <b>detection</b> can significantly improve the performance of communication system. However, its performance is poor due to the modelling error of basis expansion model (BEM) being large enough and can not being ignored in rapidly time-variant channels. In this paper, channel estimation and OFDM <b>signals</b> <b>detection</b> are integrated into a real non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. Then the modified Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (MBFGS) algorithm is adopted to search the optimal solution. In addition, Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) for our proposed approach is derived. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|Vigilance {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} to study the relative efficiency of feedback operations in enhancing vigilance performance. Two feedback operations were compared - i. e., experimenter-controlled {{feedback in the form}} of knowledge of results (KR) regarding response times to <b>signal</b> <b>detections,</b> and subject-controlled feedback in the form of self-evaluation (SE) of response times to <b>signal</b> <b>detections.</b> The subjects responded to the aperiodic offset of a visual signal during a 1 -hr vigil. Both feedback operations were found to enhance performance efficiency: subjects in the KR and SE conditions had faster response times than controls receiving no evaluative feedback. Moreover, the data of the KR and SE groups did not differ significantly from each other. The results are discussed in terms of the hypothesis that self-evaluation is a critical factor underlying the incentive value of KR in vigilance tasks...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} weak <b>signal</b> chaotic <b>detection</b> system still restricts {{some technical}} {{issues in the}} situation of the signal with noise, such as poor denoising ability and low detection precision. In this paper, we propose a novel weak <b>signal</b> chaotic <b>detection</b> system based on an improved wavelet transform algorithm. First, the traditional wavelet transform algorithm domain variables have been transformed and discretized to eliminate the redundant transform. Then, based on the discrete optimization, the wavelet coefficients have been optimized by threshold compromise strategy. The improved wavelet transform algorithm is applied in the weak <b>signal</b> chaotic <b>detection</b> system. The noise signal after finite discrete processing is treated as a perturbation of cycle power and put into a chaotic system for detecting weak signal under the noise conditions. The simulation experiments show that the proposed improved wavelet transform algorithm has a better denoising effect than the traditional wavelet transform algorithm. Moreover, the improved algorithm shows better accuracy and higher robustness in the weak <b>signal</b> chaotic <b>detection</b> system...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{shifts in the}} rate of {{presentation}} of repetitive neutral events (background event rate) were studied in a visual vigilance task. Four groups of subjects experienced either a high (21 events/min) or a low (6 events/min) event rate for 20 min and then experienced either the same or the alternate event rate for an additional 40 min. The temporal occurrence of critical target signals was identical for all groups, irrespective of event rate. The density of critical signals was 12 signals/ 20 min. By the end of the session, shifts in event rate were associated with changes in performance which resembled contrast effects found in other experimental situations in which shift paradigms were used. Relative to constant event rate control conditions, a shift from a low to a high event rate depressed the probability of <b>signal</b> <b>detections,</b> while a shift in the opposite direction enhanced the probability of <b>signal</b> <b>detections...</b>|$|R

25|$|The modern {{version of}} {{hypothesis}} testing is {{a hybrid of}} the two approaches that resulted from confusion by writers of statistical textbooks (as predicted by Fisher) beginning in the 1940s. (But <b>signal</b> <b>detection,</b> for example, still uses the Neyman/Pearson formulation.) Great conceptual differences and many caveats {{in addition to those}} mentioned above were ignored. Neyman and Pearson provided the stronger terminology, the more rigorous mathematics and the more consistent philosophy, but the subject taught today in introductory statistics has more similarities with Fisher's method than theirs. This history explains the inconsistent terminology (example: the null hypothesis is never accepted, but there is a region of acceptance).|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} framework {{has more}} recently been {{put forward by}} Wilken and Ma (2004) who suggest that apparent capacity limitations in VSTM are caused by a monotonic decline {{in the quality of}} the internal representations stored (i.e., monotonic increase in noise) as a function of set-size. In this conception capacity limitations in memory are not caused by a limit on the number of things that can be encoded, but by a decline in the quality of the representation of each thing as more things are added to memory. In their 2004 experiments, they varied color, spatial frequency, and orientation of objects stored in VSTM using a <b>signal</b> <b>detection</b> theory approach (see also the closely related work by Palmer, 1990). The participants were asked to report differences between the visual stimuli presented to them in consecutive order. The investigators found that different stimuli were encoded independently and in parallel, and that the major factor limiting report performance was neuronal noise (which is a function of visual set-size).|$|E

2500|$|Another defense {{mechanism}} for preventing infidelity is by social monitoring and acting on any violation of expectations. [...] Researchers {{in favor of}} this {{defense mechanism}} speculate that in our ancestor's times, the act of sex or emotional infidelity is what triggered jealousy and therefore the <b>signal</b> <b>detection</b> would have happened only after infidelity had occurred, making jealousy an emotional by-product with no selective function (Harris, 2005). In line with this reasoning, these researchers hypothesize that as a person monitors their partner's actions with a potential rival through primary and secondary appraisals (Harris, 2004), if their expectations are violated at either level of observation, they will become distressed and enact an appropriate action to stop the chance of infidelity (Cramer et al., 2008). Social monitoring therefore enables them to act accordingly before infidelity occurs, thereby having the capability to raise their fitness (Harris, 2004). Research testing this theory has found more favor for the sexual jealousy hypothesis (Cramer et al., 2008) and therefore more research and evidence is needed to provide support for the social monitoring theory.|$|E
2500|$|Kant had {{distinguished}} theoretical from practical reason. Rationality theorist [...] Jesús Mosterín makes {{a parallel}} distinction between {{theoretical and practical}} rationality, although, according to him, reason and rationality are not the same: reason would be a psychological faculty, whereas rationality is an optimizing [...] strategy. Humans are not rational by definition, but they can think and behave rationally or not, depending on whether they apply, explicitly or implicitly, the strategy of theoretical and practical rationality to the thoughts they accept and to the actions they perform. Theoretical rationality has a formal component that reduces to logical consistency and a material component that reduces to empirical support, relying on our inborn mechanisms of <b>signal</b> <b>detection</b> and interpretation. [...] Mosterín distinguishes between involuntary and implicit belief, on the one hand, and voluntary and explicit acceptance, on the other. Theoretical rationality can more properly be said to regulate our acceptances than our beliefs. Practical rationality is the strategy for living one’s best possible life, achieving your most important goals and your own preferences in as far as possible. Practical rationality has also a formal component, that reduces to Bayesian decision theory, and a material component, rooted in human nature (lastly, in our genome).|$|E
