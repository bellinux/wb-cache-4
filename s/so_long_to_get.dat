2500|$|After Brannick posted it on {{the wall}} of the team's press room, Lee's {{petition}} earned him congratulatory letters from Chinese Americans all over the country, and became national news, earning time on the television series What's the Story. Jack Orr, a Sporting News writer, went to Lee's restaurant and told him he was right to object. [...] "Writers shouldn't be using that term", he said. [...] "But what took you <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> around to protesting?"

Her husband, she said, had planted the orchard and kept the fence of the paddock in order, and they refused to {{compensate}} him! Then she took us up to the spare room, empty of furniture, the floor thick with dust.

2500|$|The Betty Parsons Gallery {{opened in}} 1946 at 15 East 57th Street in Manhattan. [...] The gallery {{regularly}} exhibited twelve shows a season, from September to May, with each show lasting only {{two to three}} weeks. At {{a time when the}} market for avant-garde American art was minuscule, Parsons was the only dealer willing to represent artists like Jackson Pollock after Peggy Guggenheim closed her Art of This Century gallery and returned to Europe in 1947. Parsons showed work by William Congdon, Clyfford Still, Theodoros Stamos, Ellsworth Kelly, Mark Rothko, Hedda Sterne, Forrest Bess, Michael Loew, Lyman Kipp, Judith Godwin, and Robert Rauschenberg among others. In 1950, she gave Barnett Newman, whom she had met in 1943, his first solo show; Rothko and Tony Smith assisted with the installation. In the late 1950s, Smith and Newman helped to remodel Parsons’ gallery, creating an almost cube-shaped main space framed by white walls with subtly curved corners and a concrete floor whose proportions fitted their ordered works. Helen Frankenthaler, the painter, who met Parsons in 1950, said, [...] "Betty and her gallery helped construct the center of the art world. She {{was one of the last}} of her breed." [...] Many of the Abstract Expressionist artists she had launched left her gallery for more commercial galleries such as Sam Kootz and Sidney Janis. Art critic B. H. Friedman noted, [...] "She was resentful. She had struggled <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them established, and other dealers capitalized on her efforts." ...|$|E

Kira begins to wonder if her mother's sudden death, as well as the deaths of the two other orphans' parents, were actually by the Council's hand; in order to acquire these young, gifted children - seeking to mold them into creating the future which they want.|$|R
60|$|This was a <b>long</b> time <b>to</b> wait.

The queen had also seen what the wise woman could do, so she insisted strongly that her warning should be obeyed. The king often lost his patience, and was determined to see his daughter, but the queen always put him off the idea, and so things went on, until the very day before the princess completed her fourteenth year.|$|R
5000|$|The A.V. Club writer Oliver Sava graded {{the episode}} with a C. Complaining that nothing [...] "of consequence" [...] has {{occurred}} {{for most of}} the season, Sava commented that the series [...] "is following the Lost formula of answering a question with more questions, but that’s frustrating when the characters and stories are less than captivating. The best thing this episode does is explicitly discuss fairy tale business in Storybrooke, which instills faith that the two storylines will intersect at some point. It’s just taking <b>so</b> goddamn <b>long</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there." [...] IGN columnist Amy Ratcliffe graded the episode 7 out of 10, and called Baelfire's quest to rid his father of powers [...] "heartwarming," [...] as she liked [...] "knowing there was a point where Rumplestiltskin could have changed his fate." [...] She did wish however {{that there had been a}} better payoff about August's real identity. Ratcliffe was disappointed with the revelation of August not being Rumpelstiltskin's son, commenting that it [...] "should have delivered a big punch, but it swung and missed." [...] She was [...] "impressed" [...] with Robert Carlyle's [...] "stellar" [...] performance, and concluded her review by noting the episode was [...] "entertaining, but it's not riveting as often as I hope it will be.
