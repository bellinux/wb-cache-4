5|$|Without {{speaking}} directly of death, both verses {{indicate the}} absence of a loved one, and the narrator's <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.|$|E
5|$|Yūgen (幽玄, {{profound}} sublimity): Yūgen is {{a concept}} valued in various forms of art throughout Japanese culture. Originally used to mean elegance or grace representing the perfect beauty in waka, yūgen is invisible beauty that is felt rather than seen in a work of art. The term is used specifically in relation to Noh to mean the profound beauty of the transcendental world, including mournful beauty involved in <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> loss.|$|E
5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in <b>sadness,</b> <b>and</b> amygdala in fear.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, Breckinridge's wife Ann died. Lingering <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> {{memories}} of his and Ann's life in Baltimore may have led {{him to leave the}} city and the pastorate he had held for twelve years. He was offered pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky, but instead, accepted the presidency of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1845 against the advice of his brothers John and William. A rift between Breckinridge and his brother Cabell's widow and other relatives may help account for this surprising decision. He did not feel he could yet return to his home state.|$|E

Joy reunites with a despondent <b>Sadness</b> <b>and</b> manages {{to get them to}} Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to successfully extract the idea, reactivating the console and prompting Riley to return home.|$|E
5|$|An angry Shekhar {{comes back}} home to play a {{favourite}} tune from the past on his piano. The flashback shows a young Shekhar playing Rabindranath Tagore’s tune on his piano while young Lalita and Koel are around. Lalita, with her parents having {{died in a car}} accident, lives with Gurcharan’s family. Koel is her cousin whereas Charu is her neighbour. As this scene flashes across Shekhar’s mind, he sings a song full of <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> loss. As time flies, they grow up to become close friends. The rebellious and musically inclined Shekhar spends his days playing the music of Rabindranath Tagore or Elvis Presley and composing his own songs with Lalita rather than becoming part of his shrewd father's business. Part of this rebellion involves resistance to meeting Gayatri Tantiya, the beautiful but devious daughter of a wealthy industrialist, whom his father would like Shekhar to marry. Meanwhile, Girish, a steel tycoon from London, makes a dramatic entry into Charu’s house. Girish seems smitten by Lalita while Koel is by Girish. Shekhar is visibly jealous of Lolita’s close friendship with Girish.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Riley and {{her parents}} move to San Francisco for her father's new business. Riley has poor first experiences: the new house is cramped and old, the moving van with all their {{belongings}} is misdirected, her father is under stress from his business, and a poor encounter at a pizza restaurant leaves her disheartened. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness accidentally causes Riley to cry {{in front of her}} class, creating a sad core memory. Joy, panicking, tries to dispose of it, but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, <b>Sadness,</b> <b>and</b> the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters, and taken to the maze-like storage area of long-term memory.|$|E
5|$|Belle's yellow ballgown was {{inspired}} by a similar costume Hepburn had worn in the film Roman Holiday (1953). Hahn and a team of male filmmakers designed the ballgown while consuming pizza and alcohol. Originally, the marketing department ordered that Belles' dress be pink to cater to the female audience, but art director Brian McEntee convinced studio to make the dress gold in order to make her to distinguish her from other Disney Princess, specifically Aurora's from Sleeping Beauty (1950). Art director Brian McEntee suggested that Belle be the only character in her village to wear blue in order emphasize {{the fact that she is}} different and an outcast. The colors Belle wears also mimic her emotions, blue being associated with <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> loneliness. Blue was also used to symbolize good, while Gaston's red represented evil. According to the Directory of World Cinema: American Hollywood by Lincoln Geraghty, Belle {{was inspired}} by actress Judy Garland's role as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Julie Andrews' performance as Maria von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965).|$|E
5|$|In the meanwhile, her father's {{fishing boat}} is {{taken away by}} creditors. He sinks {{into a state of}} <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> begins to drink away their savings. On one occasion, Vanaja’s {{superior}} intellect pits her against Shekhar in a public incident which ultimately humiliates him in front of his mother. Matters escalate, and one day Vanaja is raped by Shekhar. She eventually loses her job when she becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, much against Rama Devi’s wishes who would have liked her to abort the foetus. Vanaja hopes that the physical evidence of the child will be proof of the rape and that somehow Shekhar will be brought to justice. However, Shekhar has no desire to marry Vanaja because she is from a lower caste. In the end Rama Devi and Shekhar gain possession of the child, who will grow up to be an upper caste boy.|$|E

40|$|Anger {{rumination}} <b>and</b> <b>sadness</b> rumination {{were examined}} concurrently in a normative sample of adults (Study 1) and a clinical adolescent sample (Study 2). The {{purpose of this}} research was to assess if rumination on anger <b>and</b> <b>sadness</b> have distinct emotional and behavioural associations, and whether it is warranted to conceptualize them as separate constructs. In both studies, factor analysis indicated that items from analogous anger rumination <b>and</b> <b>sadness</b> rumination measures loaded onto two factors tapping anger rumination <b>and</b> <b>sadness</b> rumination, respectively. Structural equation modeling confirmed unique relations among each form of rumination and specific emotional or behavioural conditions (i. e., anger, aggression and depression). In Study 1, women scored higher than men on <b>sadness</b> rumination <b>and</b> comparable to men on anger rumination. In Study 2, adolescent girls scored higher than boys on both forms of rumination. In both studies, sex did not moderate the relations among rumination and the outcome variables. Findings supported the conceptualization of anger rumination <b>and</b> <b>sadness</b> rumination as two separate constructs. Directions for future research are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Fei {{sets out}} to destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence and Elly. In Merkaba, the party defeats Deus, but they realize that the energy {{released}} from the Wave Existence's shift will destroy the planet. Elly, inside Deus, tries to move {{it away from the}} planet and Fei, in his Xenogears, follows to save her, but both disappear in the rift. Krelian confronts them, telling Fei he only sought to end the pain and suffering that comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when it all began, when all was one, to ascend to the realm of God. Fei rejects Krelian's ideology with his love for Elly, but Krelian challenges Fei, telling him to prove this love that could make him independent of God, and calls forth Urobolus, a gigantic serpent-like incarnation of Miang. Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> despair for all the atrocities he had committed. Despite everything, Elly says that Krelian truly loved people more than anyone else. Because no one will forgive his sins, he declines Fei's offer to return and ascends to a higher plain of existence along with the Wave Existence, telling Fei and Elly that he envies them. Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite {{with the rest of the}} party.|$|E
