5000|$|There are {{claims that}} the design dates from prior to 1188 when the flag {{was used in the}} Crusades, and <b>an</b> article <b>in</b> the Encyclopædia Britannica tells that the flag was carried by the Cornish {{contingent}} at the Battle of Agincourt (1415). [...] However, the reference given by the Encyclopædia Britannica seems to have been confused with one that comes from a 1590 poem entitled Poly-Olbion by Michael Drayton. It states that the banner carried by the Cornish men at Agincourt depicted two Cornish wrestlers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unimogs were {{developed}} in post-war Germany {{to be used as}} agricultural equipment. The Unimog was designed with equal-sized wheels, <b>a</b> mounting bracket <b>in</b> front, <b>a</b> <b>hitch</b> <b>in</b> the rear, and loading space in the center. This was to make it a multi-purpose vehicle that farmers could use in the field and on the highway.|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{motivated}} by {{a need for a}} device that would carry mountain bikes to and from a trailhead, using <b>a</b> vehicle’s <b>hitch</b> receiver. It will need to carry four bikes safely and make it be easy to load and unload each bike. First, an idea will be used {{as a starting point for}} simple drawings on paper. Then, after a preliminary design is concluded, a computer-based three-dimensional design will be made. After that, all of the required materials will be purchased and gathered. Then the construction of the project will take place. Once the bike rack is completed, the testing will begin. First tests will need to take place with sand bags to simulate the weight of each bike. Also, since the rack will be used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hitch</b> receiver to transport the mountain bikes; it will need to be driven down the road with only sand bags on it for weight. A non-populated road will be needed for this test, due to the possibility of failure. If the bike rack passes the tests, it will result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> device that is able to transport four mountain bikes safely to and from a trailhead...|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> 1980 <b>a</b> <b>hitch</b> {{threatened}} to come. Through <b>a</b> decision match <b>in</b> Nunspeet (5,000) degradation was prevented by a 5-0 win over SDCP in 1982, and relegated it wrong WHC after 52 Years {{for the first}} time in its history. It lasted six years before WHC again at the highest level came back. In 1988, the ninth title won (champion second class) and with a 5-1 victory over FC Meppel WHC went back to the first class. The highest level, where WHC also hear and feel at home.|$|R

By the time he was 5, he had already put <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hitch</b> with <b>a</b> professional Shakespearean company (Ben Greet's) and was something of a veteran. During his primary education <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Canadian convent and various Seattle and New York schools, young Ross confined his appearances to choir work, including term as head monitor at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, NY. His career began in radio in 1928 and included a five-year run with Annette Hanshaw on the Maxwell House Show Boat program. His recording career began in 1929. He did so well on the radio that he gave up the legal profession and set forth on a singing career. [...] Ross went on to success in vaudeville, night clubs and films. He served in the U.S. Army in World War II, achieving the rank of Major. During the war, he was called upon to sing the Oscar-nominated ballad, [...] "We Musn't Say Goodbye," [...] for the 1943 motion picture, [...] "Stage Door Canteen." [...] The film also received an Oscar nomination for best musical score that year.|$|R

His first great success was as Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest (1936), and this led to a period of typecasting as a gangster with films such as Angels with Dirty Faces (1938).|$|R

60|$|All {{this gives}} me a feeling {{touching}} the real meaning of immortality. In this world we cannot have pure pleasure. This is partly because pure pleasure would be dangerous to us and to our neighbours. But it is partly because pure pleasure {{is a great deal}} too much trouble.

5000|$|In {{the music}} video, Michael Jackson and the dancers {{immediately}} around him perform a seemingly impossible forward lean; this illusion was created using strings and wires {{in the music}} video. To accomplish this manoeuvre <b>in</b> live shows, <b>a</b> <b>hitching</b> mechanism which Jackson co-patented was built into {{the floor of the}} stage and the performers' shoes, thereby allowing performers to lean without needing to keep their centers of mass directly over their feet. The system consists of pegs that rise from the stage at the appropriate moment and special shoes with ankle supports and cutouts in the heels which can slide over the pegs and be temporarily attached to the stage.|$|R
