5|$|In 1935, {{work began}} on the Central Valley Project (CVP), a federal water project that would develop the <b>Sacramento</b> <b>and</b> San Joaquin river systems for {{irrigation}} of the highly fertile Central Valley. However, {{after the end of}} World War II in 1945, the state experienced an economic boom that led to rapid urban and commercial growth in the central and southern portions of the state, and it became clear that California's economy could not depend solely on a state water system geared primarily towards agriculture. A new study of California's water supplies by the Division of Water Resources (now California Department of Water Resources, DWR) was carried out under an act of the California State Legislature in 1945.|$|E
5|$|In early February 1986 {{ten inches}} (254mm) of rain {{fell on the}} Sacramento region in 11 days, melting the Sierra Nevada snowpack and causing a huge flood to pour down the American River. The 1986 floods {{were some of the}} most severe {{recorded}} in the 20th century; Placer County was quickly designated a Federal Disaster Area. Rampaging streams and rivers incurred some $7.5 million in damages within the county. The rating for Sacramento's levees, supposedly designed to prevent a 125-year flood, was dropped to a 78-year flood in studies conducted after the 1986 event, which suggested that such weather occurred more frequently than previously believed. The floods tore out levees along the <b>Sacramento</b> <b>and</b> Feather Rivers through the Sacramento Valley, and the city of Sacramento was spared by a close margin. Folsom Lake filled to dangerously high levels with runoff from the North, Middle and South Forks of the American River.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Regiment faced {{discrimination}} {{during this}} period. The anti-miscegenation laws in California {{meant that the}} soldiers were banned from marrying non-Filipino women; those soldiers who wished to marry in this way were transported to Gallup, New Mexico, as New Mexico had repealed its anti-miscegenation law after the Civil War. Soldiers of the Regiment faced discrimination in Marysville while visiting from neighboring Camp Beale, as the local businesses refused to serve Filipinos. This was later remedied by the Regiment's commander, who informed the Chamber of Commerce that they were failing {{to cooperate with the}} Army, at which point they changed their business practices. Further instances of discrimination against soldiers of the Regiment were also reported in <b>Sacramento</b> <b>and</b> San Francisco, where they were mistaken for Japanese Americans.|$|E

5|$|Out of {{fourteen}} potential water sources {{considered by the}} city – which included Lake Tahoe, the Eel River, and tributaries of the <b>Sacramento</b> <b>and</b> San Joaquin Rivers– Hetch Hetchy was considered superior for its excellent dam site, abundant sediment-free water, lower cost and hydroelectric potential. At the time, Hetch Hetchy was an isolated, seldom visited subalpine valley, visited intermittently by gold seekers and sheepherders. However, since 1890, Hetch Hetchy Valley and the surrounding lands {{had been part of}} Yosemite National Park and thus off-limits to utility development, let alone at the grand scale proposed by the city. Even though the valley was not well known to the general public, organizations such as the Sierra Club treasured it for its spectacular beauty, often compared to that of Yosemite Valley itself. Led by naturalist and mountaineer John Muir, the Sierra Club adamantly opposed the city of San Francisco as it sought permission from the federal government to build a dam in the valley.|$|E
5|$|Ramírez {{began the}} 2010 {{season with the}} Athletics on their Opening Day roster. In his first six appearances, Ramírez {{recorded}} 4.50 ERA. He was optioned to the Class AAA Sacramento River Cats of the PCL on April 27. The Athletics recalled Ramírez on May 7 and he made his seventh appearance on May 12 against Texas, allowing one run on two hits and two walks in one inning. After the game, he was designated for assignment, with a 1–0 record and a 4.91 ERA in seven relief appearances. He was outrighted to the River Cats on May 21. He {{spent the rest of}} the season with <b>Sacramento,</b> <b>and</b> did not return to MLB in September.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{powerful}} thunderstorms over the United States occur in the Midwest and the Southern states. These storms can produce large hail and powerful tornadoes. Thunderstorms are relatively uncommon along much of the West Coast of the United States, but they occur with greater frequency in the inland areas, particularly the <b>Sacramento</b> <b>and</b> San Joaquin Valleys of California. In spring and summer, they occur nearly daily in certain areas of the Rocky Mountains as part of the North American Monsoon regime. In the Northeast, storms take on similar characteristics and patterns as the Midwest, but with less frequency and severity. During the summer, air-mass thunderstorms are an almost daily occurrence over central and southern parts of Florida.|$|E
