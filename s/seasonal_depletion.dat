5000|$|By 1987, in {{response}} to a dramatic <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> of the ozone layer over Antarctica, diplomats in Montreal forged a treaty, the Montreal Protocol, which called for drastic reductions in the production of CFCs. On 2 March 1989, 12 European Community nations agreed to ban the production of all CFCs {{by the end of the}} century. In 1990, diplomats met in London and voted to significantly strengthen the Montreal Protocol by calling for a complete elimination of CFCs by the year 2000. By the year 2010 CFCs should have been completely eliminated from developing countries as well.Because the only CFCs available to countries adhering to the treaty is from recycling, their prices have increased considerably. A worldwide end to production should also terminate the smuggling of this material. However, there are current CFC smuggling issues, as recognized by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) in a 2006 report titled [...] "Illegal Trade in Ozone Depleting Substances". UNEP estimates that between 16,000-38,000 tonnes of CFCs passed through the black market in the mid-1990s. The report estimated between 7,000 and 14,000 tonnes of CFCs are smuggled annually into developing countries. Asian countries are those with the most smuggling; as of 2007, China, India and South Korea were found to account for around 70% of global CFC production, South Korea later to ban CFC production in 2010. Possible reasons for continued CFC smuggling were also examined: the report noted that many banned CFC producing products have long lifespans and continue to operate. The cost of replacing the equipment of these items is sometimes cheaper than outfitting them with a more ozone-friendly appliance. Additionally, CFC smuggling is not considered a significant issue, so the perceived penalties for smuggling are low. While the eventual phaseout of CFCs is likely, efforts are being taken to stem these current non-compliance problems.|$|E

40|$|This Synthesis and Assessment Product (SAP 2. 4) {{focuses on}} the Climate models. Depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer by human-produced ozone-depleting {{substances}} has been recognized as a global environmental issue {{for more than three}} decades, and the international effort to address the issue via the United Nations Montreal Protocol marked its 20 -year anniversary in 2007. Scientific understanding underpinned the Protocol at its inception and ever since. As scientific knowledge advanced and evolved, the Protocol evolved through amendment and adjustment. Policy-relevant science has documented the rise, and now the beginning decline, of the atmospheric abundances of many ozone-depleting substances in response to actions taken by the nations of the world. Projections are for a return of ozone-depleting chemicals (compounds containing chlorine and bromine) to their "pre-ozone-depletion" (pre- 1980) levels by the middle of this century for the midlatitudes; the polar regions are expected to follow suit within 20 years after that. Since the 1980 s, global ozone sustained a depletion of about 5 percent in the midlatitudes of both the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere, where most of the Earth's population resides; it is now showing signs of turning the corner towards increasing ozone. The large <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletions</b> in the polar regions are likely to continue over the next decade but are expected to subside over the next few decades...|$|R

The main focus of our analysis is on climatological-scale processes in high latitudes. The resulting trend estimates for the past period (1980 &ndash; 1999) agree well with observation-based trend estimates. The results for the future period (2000 &ndash; 2019) suggest that the extent of <b>seasonal</b> ozone <b>depletion</b> over both northern and southern high-latitudes has likely reached its maximum. Furthermore, while climate change is expected to cool the stratosphere, this cooling is unlikely to accelerate significantly high latitude ozone depletion. However, the recovery of seasonal high latitude ozone losses will not take place during the next 15 years...|$|R

It was predicted that if intake rates of the godwits are {{in the vicinity of}} the gradient section of a functional response curve, i. e. are directly determined by prey density, they will respond rapidly to experimental reduction in the density of their prey. Bar-tailed godwits did respond rapidly, both functionally and numerically, to a decrease in the density of M longicarpus, indicating that their intake rate was limited by food availability. The estimated <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> of the stocks of Mictyris by the godwits was 88 % of the initial standing stock. Despite the virtual disappearance of Mictyris from sediment samples through the course of a non-breeding season, local densities of godwits did not change between October and March, implying that adequate rates of intake could be maintained throughout their residence period...|$|E

Hydrocarbon utilizers were ubiquitously distributed, with no significant overall concentration differences between sampling regions or between surface water and sediment samples.

Hydrocarbon biodegradation potentials were measured by using 14 C-radiolabeled hydrocarbon-spiked crude oil. There was no significant correlation between numbers of hydrocarbon utilizers and hydrocarbon biodegradation potentials. The biodegradation potentials showed large seasonal variations in the Beaufort Sea, probably due to <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> of available nutrients. Non-nutrient-limited biodegradation potentials followed the order hexadecane > naphthalene ≫ pristane > benzanthracene. In Cook Inlet, biodegradation potentials for hexadecane and naphthalene were dependent on availability of inorganic nutrients.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates seasonality, stock depletion and {{the protection}} of marine mammals using bioeconomic analysis. Seasonality reflects the availability of a renewable resource during different times of the year, and stock depletion refers to the removal rate of a renewable resource. The effects of these two components are explored under open access, optimal exploitation and individual transferable quota (ITQ) systems. ^ This dissertation is composed of three manuscripts. The first manuscript develops a theoretical model that explores seasonality and <b>seasonal</b> stock <b>depletion</b> within a single species, single fleet, and single fishery under open access conditions with constant and variable price. It is then expanded to a multifleet, multi-species scenario. Optimal exploitation and individual transferable quota (ITQs) are then investigated under seasonality and stock effects. ^ In the second manuscript, an estimate of the efficiency losses due to stock depletion {{during the course of the}} year in the New Zealand southern scallop fishery is made, which has been under ITQ management since 1992. A “race-to-fish” behavior is observed in the southern New Zealand scallop fishery. The analysis shows that if there is a lame stock depletion ITQs are not optimal. If the stock depletion is negligible, ITQs are optimal. Theoretical and empirical results of the first two manuscripts show ITQs are sub-optimal to the optimal exploitation model when there is a <b>seasonal</b> stock <b>depletion.</b> ^ Finally in the third manuscript, the biological and economic consequences of season area closures are compared to marine mammal ITQs. The results of a case study of the New England sink gillnet fishery show, ITQs for marine mammals are economically more efficient than season area closures in reducing the total harbor porpoise take. Profits under ITQs are 2 – 16 % greater than closures. Effort and profit reductions under ITQ management are spread more evenly across seasons and ports compared to closure management. ...|$|R
40|$|In the Arctic, <b>seasonal</b> ozone <b>depletion</b> is {{resulting}} in periods of enhanced UV-B radiation {{at ground level}} while regional climate change is associated with increasing temperatures. These changes are likely to alter plant distribution, biodiversity and morphology, which may have knockon effects for microbially driven biogeochemical cycling and other soil processes. Our study examined the transmission of solar UV radiation through arctic tundra plants using a portable UV radiometer and the DLR-biofilm biological UV dosimeter. A strong negative correlation was found between vegetation cover and UV transmission to the soil surface. Penetration of UV to the soil beneath tundra plants varied depending upon plant morphology, being greater through low creeping plants than cushion plants, grasses or mosses. UV transmission to the soil surface beyond the foliage edge also varied with plant morphology {{and the presence of}} flowers...|$|R

Microplankton mostly dominated phytoplankton biomass. Protozooplankton corresponded to 10 - 25 % of autotroph biomass. 2. Nitrate decrease during the investigations was converted to new production of 11 and 13 gC m- 2 for coastal and oceanic waters, respectively.

It is suggested that new production is high during brief periods, when biomass accumulation is enhanced by transient reduction of vertical mixing. 5. Sedimentation of organic matter amounted to 2. 4 gC m- 2 for the investigation period and was dominated by zooplankton faeces. 6. Trap collections probably underestimated vertical flux. 7.

Photodecomposition of CFCl 3 on an ice surface grown on Ru(001) is studied in connection with the formation of chlorine reservoir in ozone hole chemistry. We have evidenced that the photolysis of CFCl 3 on the ice surface leaves anionic chlorine are coordinated to the free OH species. This enables high concentration storage of chlorine on the ice surface. The seasonal ozone depletion above the Antarctic has been of particular interest because it has suffered extensive damage: this is well known “ozone hole”. 1) The ozone layer over the Antarctic becomes a catastrophically damaged in spring;in winter, however, the hole is closed. The theory that accounts for <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> of ozone considers thereservoirs. 2) Less reactive compounds such as HCl or ClONO 2 are considered as the reservoirs.

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} dynamics of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved phosphate, dissolved silica and chlorophyll a were measured seasonally at eight stations in the Ria de Aveiro. Between December 2000 and September 2001, the seasonal succession of phytoplankton assemblages, inferred after the spatial and seasonal variation of silica and of chlorophyll a concentrations, showed that diatoms (μmol Si L− 1) dominated from late autumn until early spring, while chlorophytes (μg Chl a L− 1) bloomed during late spring and summer. The Si:N:P ratios and Si concentrations indicated no <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> in dissolved silica, as in other temperate systems, possibly because of abnormal precipitation and flood events prolonging the supply of dissolved Si to the system. The Si:N:P ratios suggested P limitation at the system level. Despite the relative proportions of available nutrients, the mean phosphorus concentration (5. 3 μmol L− 1) was above the reported half-saturation constants for P uptake by phytoplankton. Thus, in Ria de Aveiro, the seasonal succession of phytoplankton assemblages may also be dependent on the grazing capacity of the pelagic community through top-down regulation...|$|E

The seismic sequence occurred during a <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> of hydrostructures, and the four strongest earthquakes (Mw ≥ 5. 5) generated an abrupt uplift of the water level, recorded up to 100 km away from the mainshock area. Monitoring a set of selected springs in the central Apennines, a few hydrogeochemical anomalies were observed months {{before the onset of}} the seismic swarm, including a variation of pH values and an increase of As, V, and Fe concentrations. Cr concentrations increased immediately after the onset of the seismic sequence. On November 2016, these elements recovered to their usual low concentrations.

Prediction equations were developed during a four-year calibration period using regression analysis between the treated plots and the control. One prediction equation was also developed by pooling all three treated plots {{and running a}} regression against the control plot. The parameter used in the above equations was inches of water loss per day. Prediction equations using <b>seasonal</b> water <b>depletion</b> loss in inches were also developed between the clearcut plots and the control.

40|$|The Scotia Sea {{area has}} high {{productivity}} {{relative to the}} Southern Ocean as a whole, but this displays strong latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. Elucidating the extent of these from a single cruise is problematic, given the high variability of bloom timing and location in this region. Therefore, this study used data from transects across the central Scotia Sea in spring, summer and autumn of 2006, 2008 and 2009, combined with satellite data, to obtain a larger-scale appreciation of the latitudinal contrasts in phytoplankton standing stock and primary production across the region. Concentrations of nitrate, phosphate and particularly silicic acid increased towards {{the south of the}} transect with the latter showing a step change at the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF). Changes in seasonal nutrient concentrations indicated increasing phytoplankton uptake north of ∼ 57 °S that peaked at ∼ 53 °S in the Georgia Basin. Based on <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletions</b> of nitrate relative to phosphate, the highest relative nitrate uptake occurred northwest of South Georgia {{on the periphery of the}} Georgia Basin, indicating efficient nitrate use here due to iron-replete conditions. An integrative approach to examine these gradients was with the use of 10 -year satellite climatology data. These showed that the lowest mean chlorophyll a (chl-a) values were in the central/northern Scotia Sea, but these were still substantial values, 67 % of values within the Georgia Basin bloom. Cruise data on chl-a and on microplankton biomass from cell counts support this finding of substantial biomass in the central Scotia Sea; since these averaged half of values in the iron-fertilised bloom of the Georgia Basin downstream of South Georgia. Given that our transect was nearly 1000 km long and in parts was land remote with low iron concentrations, the relatively high production in the central and northern Scotia Sea is surprising. Iron levels may be maintained here by efficient recycling and irregular injections, possibly for example from dust deposition or shelf-derived inputs from the south. The moderate chl-a concentration across the mid-Scotia Sea and southwest of South Georgia reflect periodic, non-ice-associated blooms that occur in some years and not others. These may provide a connection between the large populations of krill inhabiting the northern and southern fringes of the Scotia Sea...|$|R

Compared to ozone loss deduced from HALOE measurements the model underestimates chemical loss by 37 %. The average multidecadal trend in loss from 1960 to 1999 is 17 +/- 3 DU per decade. The largest contribution to this trend comes from the 62 +/- 11 DU ozone loss increase between the 1970 s and 1990 s...|$|R
40|$|Lake Victoria, {{the largest}} {{tropical}} {{lake in the}} world, suffers from severe eutrophication and the probable extinction of {{up to half of}} its 500 + species of endemic cichlid fishes. The continuing degradation of Lake Victoria's ecological functions has serious long-term consequences for the ecosystem services it provides, and may threaten social welfare in the countries bordering its shores. Evaluation of recent ecological changes in the context of aquatic food-web alterations, catchment disturbance and natural ecosystem variability has been hampered by the scarcity of historical monitoring data. Here, we present high-resolution palaeolimnological data, which show that increases in phytoplankton production developed from the 1930 s onwards, which parallels human-population growth and agricultural activity in the Lake Victoria drainage basin. Dominance of bloom-forming cyanobacteria since the late 1980 s coincided with a relative decline in diatom growth, which {{can be attributed to the}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> of dissolved silica resulting from 50 years of enhanced diatom growth and burial. Eutrophication-induced loss of deep-water oxygen started in the early 1960 s, and may have contributed to the 1980 s collapse of indigenous fish stocks by eliminating suitable habitat for certain deep-water cichlids. Conservation of Lake Victoria as a functioning ecosystem is contingent upon large-scale implementation of improved land-use practices...|$|E

Turbidity signals were analyzed {{for three years}} in order {{to look at the}} relationships between seasonal turbidity trends, event turbidity patterns, and precipitation type to stream sediment production and transport. Seasonal patterns showed more turbidity events associated with fall and early to mid- winter events than with peak snow-melt. No significant turbidity patterns emerged for periods of snow melt vs. rain. Single event hysteresis loops showed clockwise patterns were dominant suggesting local sediment sources. In successive discharge events, the largest turbidity spike was often associated with the first but not necessarily the largest discharge event-indicating <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> of local sediment stores. In multi-peaked discharge events, hysteresis loops shifted from clockwise to linear or random patterns suggesting that localized sediment stores are being used up and sufficient flow energy must be reached to start entraining the more consolidated bank/bed sediment or that dominant sediment sources may be shifting to less localized areas such as hill slopes. A conceptual model with phases of accumulation and transport is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The Ross Sea polynya {{is among}} the most {{productive}} regions in the Southern Ocean and may constitute a significant oceanic CO 2 sink. Based on results from several field studies, this region has been considered seasonally iron limited, whereby a "winter reserve" of dissolved iron (dFe) is progressively depleted during the growing season to low concentrations (~ 0. 1 nM) that limit phytoplankton growth in the austral summer (December-February). Here we report new iron data for the Ross Sea polynya during austral summer 2005 - 2006 (27 December- 22 January) and the following austral spring 2006 (16 November- 3 December). The summer 2005 - 2006 data show generally low dFe concentrations in polynya surface waters (0. 10 ± 0. 05 nM in upper 40 m, n = 175), consistent with previous observations. Surprisingly, our spring 2006 data reveal similar low surface dFe concentrations in the polynya (0. 06 ± 0. 04 nM in upper 40 m, n = 69), in association with relatively high rates of primary production (~ 170 - 260 mmol C/m** 2 /d). These results indicate that the winter reserve dFe may be consumed relatively early in the growing season, such that polynya surface waters can become "iron limited" as early as November; i. e., the <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> of dFe is not necessarily gradual. Satellite observations reveal significant biomass accumulation in the polynya during summer 2006 - 2007, implying significant sources of "new" dFe to surface waters during this period. Possible sources of this new dFe include episodic vertical exchange, lateral advection, aerosol input, and reductive dissolution of particulate iron...|$|E
40|$|This study {{documents}} {{the effect of}} sex on gonad carotenoid content during the annual reproductive cycle of Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis from northern Norway. Male and female S. droebachiensis exhibited distinctly different patterns of carotenoid variation, with <b>seasonal</b> carotenoid <b>depletion</b> and replenishment in females and carotenoid retention in males. Females lost approximately 71. 1 % of their echinenone during spawning, and compensated for the loss by active deposition during gonad regrowth. Female carotenoid levels (100 to 275 μg g– 1 dry mass), although lower and less variable than male carotenoid levels, were consistently higher than predicted by estimates based on a constant post-spawning carotenoid content. Males did not lose carotenoids during spawning, and the concentration of carotenoids in male gonads varied from > 600 to < 200 μg g– 1 dry mass, apparently as a passive result of increasing gonad size. The results suggest that carotenoid supplements in urchin diets would be largely wasted in gonad enhancement cultivation of male S. droebachiensis, and {{emphasize the importance of}} controlling future feeding trials for the confounding effect of sex on carotenoid deposition...|$|R
40|$|The sudden {{onset of}} catastrophic ozone losses over Antarctica {{a decade ago}} evokes the {{response}} of a feedback system under a steady perturbation. In this paper an explicit feedback mechanism is proposed and incorporated into a kinetic model that mimics observable trends for major variables. The essence of the proposal is that the extent and time profile of <b>seasonal</b> ozone <b>depletion</b> actually imply the coupling of [O_ 3], radiative heating, cloud persistence and heterogeneous regeneration of photochemically active chlorine species. The model seeks insight into the phenomenon as a paradigm of unanticipated amplification of human activity, strives for clarity and relevance and complies with fundamental principles and with global constraints such as ozone levels and decay rates, chlorine monoxide and nitrogen dioxide concentrations and cloud sightings. Two main conclusions emerge: 1) the local regeneration of active chlorine mediated by nitrogen dioxide on ice clouds after sunrise is a key factor, and 2) local ozone losses become highly sensitive to initial conditions, and to slight perturbations of the catalytic activity of clouds, above critical levels of active chlorine...|$|R
40|$|Prompted {{by recent}} {{observations}} of seasonal low dissolved oxygen from two moorings in the North Sea, a hydrographic survey in August 2010 mapped the spatial extent of summer oxygen depletion. Typical near-bed dissolved oxygen saturations in the stratified {{regions of the}} North Sea were 75 – 80 % while the well-mixed regions of the southern North Sea reached 90 %. Two regions of strong thermal stratification, the area between the Dooley and Central North Sea Currents and the area known as the Oyster Grounds, had oxygen saturations as low as 65 and 70 % (200 and 180 µmol dm- 3) respectively. Low dissolved oxygen was apparent in regions characterised by low advection, high stratification, elevated organic matter production from the spring bloom and a deep chlorophyll maximum.

Results from both cruises indicate a general north-to-south decrease in mixed-layer dFe concentrations, from values as high as 0. 76 nM in the Subtropical Front to uniformly low concentrations (< 0. 1 nM) between the Polar Front and the Antarctic continental shelf. Samples collected from the seasonal sea-ice zone in November–December 2001 provide no evidence of significant dFe inputs from the melting pack ice, which may explain the absence of pronounced ice-edge algal blooms in this sector of the Southern Ocean, as implied by satellite ocean-color images. Our data also allow us to infer changes in the dFe concentration of surface waters during the growing season. South of the Polar Front, a comparison of near-surface with subsurface (150 m depth) dFe concentrations in November–December 2001 suggests a net seasonal biological uptake of at least ~ 0. 14 – 0. 18 nM dFe, of which ~ 0. 05 – 0. 12 nM is depleted early in the growing season (before mid December). A comparison of our spring 2001 and fall 1998 data indicates a barely discernible <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> of dFe (~ 0. 03 nM) within the Polar Frontal Zone. Further north, most of our iron profiles do not exhibit near-surface depletions, and mixed-layer dFe concentrations are sometimes higher in samples from fall 1998 compared to spring 2001; here, the near-surface dFe distributions appear {{to be dominated by}} time-varying inputs of aerosol iron or advection of iron-rich subtropical waters from the north...|$|E
40|$|Algae are {{the base}} of coastal food webs because they provide the source of organic carbon for the {{remaining}} members of the community. Thus, the rate that they produce organic carbon {{to a large extent}} controls the productivity of the entire ecosystem. Factors that control algal productivity range from the physical (e. g., temperature, light), chemical (e. g., nutrient levels) to the biological (e. g., grazing). Currently, levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide surficial fluxes of ultraviolet radiation are rising. Both of these environmental variables can {{have a profound effect on}} algal productivity. Atmospheric carbon dioxide may increase surficial levels of dissolved inorganic carbon. Our laboratory and field studies of algal mats and phytoplankton cultures under ambient and elevated levels of pCO 2 show that elevated levels of inorganic carbon can cause an increase in photosynthetic rates. In some cases, this increase will cause an increase in phytoplankton numbers. There may be an increase in the excretion of fixed carbon, which in turn may enhance bacterial productivity. Alternatively, in analogy with studies on the effect of elevated pCO 2 on plants, the phytoplankton could change their carbon to nitrogen ratios, which will effect the feeding of the planktonic grazers. The <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> of stratospheric ozone has resulted in elevated fluxes of UVB radiation superimposed on the normal seasonal variation. Present surface UV fluxes have a significant impact on phytoplankton physiology, including the inhibition of the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis, inhibition of nitrogenase activity, inhibition of heterocyst formation, reduction in motility, increased synthesis of the UV-screening pigment scytonemin, and mutation. After reviewing these issues, recent work in our lab on measuring the effect of UV radiation on phytoplankton in the San Francisco Bay Estuary will be presented...|$|E
40|$|During the {{austral summer}} of 2004 – 2005, a large multi-disciplinary {{research}} cruise investigated {{the development and}} fate of a naturally iron-fertilised phytoplankton bloom in the Southern Ocean (Crozet Plateau). As part of this extensive process study, a neutrally buoyant sediment trap (PELAGRA) was deployed to constrain the magnitude, composition, and variability of upper-ocean particle export. In the productive regime north of the plateau we observed depth-normalised (100 -m) organic carbon fluxes between 11 and 440 mg C m− 2 d− 1, and in the HNLC control region to the south similarly normalised fluxes between 28 and 46 mg C m− 2 d− 1. Mass balance calculations indicate that {{the high levels of}} carbon export north of the plateau would need to be maintained for at least 30 days in order to account for estimated <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> of dissolved silicic acid in surface waters. This would imply that the flux of organic carbon is ≈ 15 g C m− 2 for the period of the bloom north of the plateau. A range of export ratios (proportion of surface production lost to downward flux) was calculated using both contemporaneous and retrospective estimates of integrated production, and these highlight the temporal decoupling between production and export. Calculated export ratios were at their highest north of the plateau and correlate strongly with the selective export of large, heavily silicified diatoms, particularly Eucampia antarctica, relative to the surface community structure. By normalising the molar elemental ratios measured in the exported particles to the molar elemental ratios of the upper-ocean particle field we also observed a strong decoupling of Si:C and Si:N. This suggests that the decoupling of the global silica and carbon cycles, which is well known as a defining feature of the Southern Ocean, has its origins in the upper ocean...|$|E
40|$|<b>Seasonal</b> oxygen <b>depletion</b> (hypoxia) {{in coastal}} bottom waters {{can lead to}} the release and {{persistence}} of free sulfide (euxinia), which is highly detrimental to marine life. Although coastal hypoxia is relatively common, reports of euxinia are less frequent, which suggests that certain environmental controls can delay the onset of euxinia. However, these controls and their prevalence are poorly understood. Here we present field observations from a seasonally hypoxic marine basin (Grevelingen, The Netherlands), which suggest that the activity of cable bacteria, a recently discovered group of sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms inducing long-distance electron transport, can delay the onset of euxinia in coastal waters. Our results reveal a remarkable seasonal succession of sulfur cycling pathways, which was observed over multiple years. Cable bacteria dominate the sediment geochemistry in winter, whereas, after the summer hypoxia, Beggiatoaceae mats colonize the sediment. The specific electrogenic metabolism of cable bacteria generates a large buffer of sedimentary iron oxides before the onset of summer hypoxia, which captures free sulfide in the surface sediment, thus likely preventing the development of bottom water euxinia. As cable bacteria are present in many seasonally hypoxic systems, this euxinia-preventing firewall mechanism could be widely active, and may explain why euxinia is relatively infrequently observed in the coastal ocean...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a metabolically {{flexible}} {{member of}} the Gammaproteobacteria. Under anaerobic conditions {{and the presence of}} nitrate, P. aeruginosa can perform (complete) denitrification, a respiratory process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to nitrogen gas via nitrite ($NO_{ 2 }$), nitric oxide ($NO$) and nitrous oxide ($N_{ 2 }O$). This study focuses on understanding the influence of environmental conditions on bacterial denitrification performance, using a mathematical model of a metabolic network in P. aeruginosa. To our knowledge, this is the first mathematical model of denitrification for this bacterium. Analysis of the long-term behavior of the network under changing concentration levels of oxygen ($O_{ 2 }$), nitrate ($NO_{ 3 }$), and phosphate ($PO_{ 4 }$) suggests that $PO_{ 4 }$ concentration strongly affects denitrification performance. The model provides five predictions on denitrification activity of P. aeruginosa under various environmental conditions, and these predictions are either experimentally validated or supported by pertinent biological literature. One motivation for this study is to capture the effect of $PO_{ 4 }$ on a denitrification metabolic network of P. aeruginosa in order to shed light on mechanisms for greenhouse gas $N_{ 2 }O$ accumulation during <b>seasonal</b> oxygen <b>depletion</b> in aquatic environments such as Lake Erie (Laurentian Great Lakes, USA).

40|$|ABSTRACT. The reoccurring {{region of}} {{seasonal}} hypoxia {{in the central}} basin of Lake Erie (“the dead zone”) has been of significant interest to researchers {{over the past several}} years. Surprisingly however, no efforts to characterize the endemic microbial community, responsible for the consumption of oxygen in this system, have been published. To understand how the microbial community may be interacting with this event, we have begun to characterize microbial members by using molecular tools. Phycoerythrin-rich cyanobacteria appear abundant and active in a narrow region (~ 1. 5 m) below the thermocline dur-ing hypoxic conditions, reaching abundances of greater than 105 mL– 1 and being the primary agent releasing 1. 5 mg O 2 L– 1 above the daytime demands in this region. Sequencing of 16 S rDNA amplicons, generated with universal eubacterial primer sets, from the Lake Erie’s hypolimnion during <b>seasonal</b> oxy-gen <b>depletion</b> demonstrated that cyanobacteria, most closely related to phycoerythrin-rich Synechococ-cus spp., dominate during rapid drawdown of oxygen (0. 083 mg L– 1 d– 1 in 2004) in this region. Analyses of another conserved marker of phylogeny (RuBisCO) has been used to confirm the presence of these cell types. Numerous distinct taxa of heterotrophic bacteria are also represented in the 16 S library. The {{results of this study suggest}} that novel groups of cyanobacteria may persist within the Lake Erie dead zone during hypoxic conditions and, along with the heterotrophic community, strongly influence system geochemistry...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the island mass effect of South Georgia on the seasonal marine carbon cycle was investigated during austral summer (January-February) 2008. South Georgia (54 - 55 °S 36 - 38 °W) lies on the North Scotia Ridge, strongly influencing {{the passage of the}} Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front to the south. Surface waters upstream of the island, in the central Scotia Sea, were characterised by relative high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) conditions from winter (September) 2007 to summer, as indicated by satellite and shipboard observations. The fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO 2) was slightly supersaturated and the HNLC waters represented a summertime CO 2 source of 2. 6 ± 1. 5 mmol m- 2 day- 1. Extensive phytoplankton blooms developed in the Georgia Basin, downstream of South Georgia, in October 2007 and persisted until March 2008. The <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was 94 ± 1 µmol kg- 1 and the ?fCO 2 (sea-air) was - 92 ± 21 µatm in the core of the bloom by early February. These conditions created a strong sink for atmospheric CO 2 of - 12. 9 ± 11. 7 mmol m- 2 day- 1. In contrast, wintertime mixing into DIC-rich sub-surface waters created a strong CO 2 source of 22. 0 ± 14. 4 mmol m- 2 day- 1. These processes drive substantial seasonal changes in DIC of up to - 0. 7 µmol kg- 1 day- 1 from winter to summer. Similarly to the blooms of Kerguelen and Crozet, the South Georgia bloom is likely to be fuelled by natural iron fertilisation. A DIC deficit of 2. 2 ± 0. 3 mol m- 2 upstream of South Georgia suggested that the relative HNLC waters were more productive than indicated by satellites. The DIC deficit more than doubled downstream of South Georgia (4. 6 ± 0. 8 mol m- 2) to create the strongest seasonal carbon uptake in ice-free waters of the Southern Ocean to date...|$|E
40|$|Plants store {{large amounts}} of {{non-structural}} carbohydrates (NSC). While multiple functions of NSC have long been recognized, the interpretation of NSC seasonal dynamics is often {{based on the idea}} that stored NSC is a reservoir of carbon that fluctuates depending on the balance between supply via photosynthesis and demand for growth and respiration (the source–sink dynamics concept). Consequently, relatively high NSC concentrations in some plants have been interpreted to reflect excess supply relative to demand. An alternative view, however, is that NSC accumulation reflects the relatively high NSC levels required for plant survival; an important issue that remains highly controversial. Here, we assembled a new global database to examine broad patterns of seasonal NSC variation across organs (leaves, stems, and belowground), plant functional types (coniferous, drought-deciduous angiosperms, winter deciduous angiosperms, evergreen angiosperms, and herbaceous) and biomes (boreal, temperate, Mediterranean, and tropical). We compiled data from 121 studies, including seasonal measurements for 177 species under natural conditions. Our results showed that, on average, NSC account for ~ 10 % of dry plant biomass and are highest in leaves and lowest in stems, whereas belowground organs show intermediate concentrations. Total NSC, starch, and soluble sugars (SS) varied seasonally, with a strong depletion of starch during the growing season and a general increase during winter months, particularly in boreal and temperate biomes. Across functional types, NSC concentrations were highest and most variable in herbaceous species and in conifer needles. Conifers showed the lowest stem and belowground NSC concentrations. Minimum NSC values were relatively high (46 % of seasonal maximums on average for total NSC) and, in contrast to average values, were similar among biomes and functional types. Overall, although starch depletion was relatively common, <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> of total NSC or SS was rare. These results are consistent with a dual view of NSC function: whereas starch acts mostly as a reservoir for future use, soluble sugars perform immediate functions (e. g., osmoregulation) and are kept above some critical threshold. If confirmed, this dual function of NSC will have important implications for the way we understand and model plant carbon allocation and survival under stress...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of eddy structures on the <b>seasonal</b> <b>depletion</b> of {{dissolved inorganic carbon}} (DIC) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) disequilibrium was investigated during a trans-Atlantic crossing of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) in austral summer 2012. The Georgia Basin, downstream of the island of South Georgia (54 - 55 °S, 36 - 38 °W) is a highly dynamic region due to the mesoscale activity associated with {{the flow of the}} Subantarctic Front (SAF) and Polar Front (PF). Satellite sea-surface height and chlorophyll-a anomalies revealed a cyclonic cold core that dominated the northern Georgia Basin that was formed from a large meander of the PF. Warmer waters influenced by the SAF formed a smaller anticyclonic structure to the east of the basin. Both the cold core and warm core eddy structures were hotspots of carbon uptake relative {{to the rest of the}} ACC section during austral summer. This was most amplified in the cold core where greatest CO 2 undersaturation (- 78 µatm) and substantial surface ocean DIC deficit (5. 1 mol m- 2) occurred. In the presence of high wind speeds, the cold core eddy acted as a strong sink for atmospheric CO 2 of 25. 5 mmol m- 2 day- 1. Waters of the warm core displayed characteristics of the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ), with warmer upper ocean waters and enhanced CO 2 undersaturation (- 59 µatm) and depletion of DIC (4. 9 mol m- 2). A proposed mechanism for the enhanced carbon uptake across both eddy structures is based on the Ekman eddy pumping theory: (i) the cold core is seeded with productive (high chlorophyll-a) waters from the Antarctic Zone and sustained biological productivity through upwelled nutrient supply that counteracts DIC inputs from deep waters; (ii) horizontal entrainment of low-DIC surface waters (biological uptake) from the PFZ downwell within the warm core and cause relative DIC-depletion in the upper water column. The observations suggest that the formation and northward propagation of cold core eddies in the region of the PF could project low-DIC waters towards the site of Antarctic Intermediate Water formation and enhance CO 2 drawdown into the deep ocean...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{shipboard}} experiments using the radiotracer 109 Cd investigated {{the role of}} phytoplankton and bacteria in the uptake of dissolved Cd in the English Channel and Celtic Sea. The results demonstrate that Cd uptake is related to rates of primary production and bacterial numbers. Statistical analysis of plankton species abundance infer that Rhizosolenia, Chaetoceros and Pseudonitzschia diatom species are {{largely responsible for the}} higher Cd uptake observed in the > 5 ?m size fraction during a diatom-dominated spring bloom. Total Cd uptake rates during winter non-bloom conditions were between 0. 04 and 0. 29 pmol l– 1 h– 1, and increased to between 0. 43 and 1. 23 pmol l– 1 h– 1 during diatom bloom conditions. These uptake rates are consistent with the <b>seasonal</b> surface <b>depletion</b> of Cd reported in the Celtic Sea and attributed to uptake by phytoplankton bloom material. A calculated Cd:C ratio of 3. 1 ?mol mol– 1 for natural plankton samples of the Celtic Sea agrees well with results of previous culture studies, which have reported ratios between 0. 1 and 5. 0 ?mol mol– 1 for the coastal diatoms Thalassiosira weissflogii and T. pseudonana. Cd uptake was also linearly related to bacterial numbers, which was attributed to surface adsorption of Cd ions onto bacterial particles which have relatively high specific surface areas. These results demonstrate surface adsorption of Cd onto bacterial surfaces, and other biogenic non-living particles, i. e. ‘passive Cd uptake’, which is significantly augmented during a spring diatom bloom...|$|R
40|$|We use the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) {{chemistry}} and transport model with Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) meteorological fields to quantify heterogeneous chemical ozone loss in Arctic winters 2005 - 2015. Comparisons to Aura Microwave Limb Sounder N 2 O and O 3 observations show the GMI simulation credibly represents the transport processes and net heterogeneous chemical loss necessary to simulate Arctic ozone. We {{find that the}} maximum <b>seasonal</b> ozone <b>depletion</b> varies linearly {{with the number of}} cold days and with wave driving (eddy heat flux) calculated from MERRA fields. We use this relationship and MERRA temperatures to estimate seasonal ozone loss from 1993 to 2004 when inorganic chlorine levels were in the same range as during the Aura period. Using these loss estimates and the observed March mean 63 - 90 N column O 3, we quantify the sensitivity of the ozone dynamical resupply to wave driving, separating it from the sensitivity of ozone depletion to wave driving. The results show that about 2 / 3 of the deviation of the observed March Arctic O 3 from an assumed climatological mean is due to variations in O 3 resupply and 13 is due to depletion. Winters with a stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) before mid-February have about 1 / 3 the depletion of winters without one and export less depletion to the midlatitudes. However, a larger effect on the spring midlatitude ozone comes from dynamical differences between warm and cold Arctic winters, which can mask or add to the impact of exported depletion...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{stratification}} in Lake Erken {{was short and}} relatively unstable in 1989. Changes in the species composition of the phytoplankton between early May and August followed the general succession pattern outlined for other temperate lakes. Fast-growing, r-strategist cryptophytes, dominant in the early phase of succession, could be separated sufficiently by 12 mu m membrane filters from larger K-strategists like Ceratium hirundinella and Gleootrichia echinulata which dominated in July. Under more turbulent conditions, the biomass of diatoms increased, and these species were also > 12 mu m. Growth rates of the phytoplankton {{and those of the}} two size groups were sensitive to the species composition, but fitted reasonably to the Droop model. Long turnover times of orthophosphate in the water, the Phosphorus Deficiency Indicator defined here as the ratio of the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis and the conductivity coefficient of phosphate uptake, and relative growth rates generally indicated low P-deficiency. Moderate deficiency was observed in late July, {{towards the end of the}} stratification period. Steady-state net P-uptake rates were calculated from the Droop model and compared with instantaneous net P-uptake rates estimated from P- 32 uptake kinetics by the linear force-flow relationship of Falkner et al. (Arch. Microbiol., 152, 353 - 361, 1989). The two data sets showed surprisingly similar <b>seasonal</b> trends. <b>Depletion</b> of epilimnetic soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) resulted in enhanced utilization of intracellularly stored P. Such periods were, however, interrupted by elevated SRP inputs to the epilimnion that led to luxury P uptake and a low incidence of P deficiency...|$|R
