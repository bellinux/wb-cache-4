From the driver's cab the wounded could also be accessed through a small internal door with a seat. The exterior was mainly made from painted canvas.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} improve sales {{prospects}} in the US, the fifth prototype was fitted with the US-built Garrett TPE-331 {{in place of the}} French Astazou. Changing to the US-built engine was enough to allow the United States Air Force (USAF) to consider it for cargo use. It eventually placed an order for 11, fitted with a cargo door and accommodation for 12 passengers or six <b>stretcher</b> <b>cases,</b> {{to be known as the}} C-10A, or Jetstream 3M. The USAF cancelled its order in October 1969 citing late delivery.|$|R

This was followed in production by a six-seat utility transport version designated THK-5A and three examples of an improved version of the 5A designated THK-10.

Colonel Graeme Warrack—the senior medical officer—asked permission to arrange a truce; it was a request that Urquhart agreed to. Warrack was taken to see Bittrich who similarly agreed and offered Warrack as many supplies as he could carry. Between 15:00 and 17:00, a general ceasefire went into effect around the perimeter and about 450 <b>stretcher</b> <b>cases</b> and walking wounded were evacuated from the perimeter, the Germans using jeeps and ambulances to take serious cases straight to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Arnhem where British, German and Dutch medical staff worked side by side.|$|R
2500|$|The {{military}} transport version, {{often called}} the Yak-16-II, differed from the passenger version as it carried a UTK-1 ball turret that mounted a [...] Berezin UBT machine gun immediately behind the flight deck, the cargo cabin floor was reinforced, the vertical tail was slightly larger and the fuselage was slightly longer. It used three-bladed V-511 feathering propellers with scimitar-shaped blades. It could carry seven paratroopers, ten fully equipped troops or six <b>stretcher</b> <b>cases</b> and a medical attendant. It was fitted with a large clamshell door {{on the left side}} of the fuselage to facilitate cargo loading. This door had a smaller, inward-opening door set into its forward half. Three TsDMMM-120 supply containers could be fitted on racks underneath the wing center section and it was fitted with a glider tow hook.|$|R

Twenty were <b>stretcher</b> <b>cases.</b> On 29 November 1943 the ship was torpedoed by [...] near Kangean Island east of Madoera Island. Most of the POWs drowned in the holds of the ship. Unknown to Bonefish, Suez Maru was carrying 415 British and 133 Dutch POWs. Those who escaped from the holds and left the ship were shot by the Japanese. Minesweeper W.12 picked up the Japanese survivors although recently released documents state that W.12 machine-gunned the surviving POWs (a minimum of 250) in the water, There were no POW survivors.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{recapture}} of Kokoda, air landings and evacuation {{could occur}} from its landing strip {{and it became}} the main point of evacuation. As well as C-47s landing with supplies, Stinson L-1 Vigilant light observation aircraft converted for use as air ambulances, flew into Kokoda. At the start of November, the detachment at Myola was caring for 438 sick and wounded. Many walked back along the track as they became sufficiently well to make the trek. Some had to wait up to {{two and a half}} months before porters were available to carry the <b>stretcher</b> <b>cases</b> forward to Kokoda for evacuation by air. The last arrived at Port Moresby only a couple of days before Christmas. Norris later wrote and questioned: [...] "why after three years of war no adequate ambulance planes were available"? ...|$|R
50|$|After a short repair {{period in}} late July and early August, the ship resumed duty {{transporting}} troops to Europe. On 8 September 1918, Captain Yates Stirling, Jr. transferred command to Captain Cyrus R. Miller. Between late August and the Armistice on 11 November, Von Steuben made three more round-trip voyages carrying troops to France and returning {{the sick and}} wounded to the U.S. Though all three were peaceful passages by wartime standards, they were not uneventful. On the return voyage from {{the first of the}} three, she weathered a severe hurricane during which three of her complement were washed overboard and lost at sea, while several others received injuries. During the New York-to-Brest leg of the second, the influenza epidemic of 1918 struck the 2,700 troops she had embarked and resulted in 400 <b>stretcher</b> <b>cases</b> and 34 deaths.|$|R
5000|$|In {{carrying}} out these invasions, LST-18 was under attack on eight different occasions by enemy planes, shore installations and torpedo.

The ship carried approximately [...] of equipment in all these trips and about 16,000 Army and Navy personnel.

There were three deaths aboard; one Army enlisted who had been brought on board for treatment; one Army passenger who died of wounds during an air attack (mentioned earlier) and one prisoner of war who was brought on board for treatment.

Its cabin, behind the 185 hp Lycoming flat six engine, was 3.26 m (10 ft 6 in) {{long to the}} rear of the pod. There were two front seats under the wing leading edge, two more behind and room for one or two (stacked) <b>stretcher</b> <b>cases.</b> The cabin had two windows on each side and the rear part of the pod, which projected behind the wing trailing edge, was also extensively glazed. The two tail booms, of all ply construction, were integral with the wing centre section. The fins, with long chord underside fillets, were integral with the booms. The tailplane was rectangular and extended beyond the fins, carrying a horn balanced elevator. The fixed surfaces were of wood and ply construction, with Wobex covering; control surfaces were fabric covered.|$|R
5000|$|With {{elements}} of the 1st Marine Provisional Brigade embarked, Gunston Hall departed San Diego 1 July 1950 and reached Pusan, Korea, via Yokosuka 3 August. Disembarking the Marines, she took aboard 30 <b>stretcher</b> <b>cases</b> and returned to Osaka, Japan. On 10 September Gunston Hall sailed from Japan {{to participate in the}} amphibious operation at Inchon, Korea, 15 September. After the Marines had landed midway up the peninsula, threatening to cut the communist supply lines to their troops {{at the tip of the}} peninsula, Gunston Hall made several shuttle trips to bring reinforcements. As the Korean War settled into its long and bloody pattern of near stalemate, Gunston Hall continued to shuttle troops and supplies between Japan and Korea. During an overhaul in the summer of 1952, she was fitted with a helicopter landing and launching platform large enough to accommodate nine [...] "whirly-birds", the newest element in amphibious warfare.|$|R
2500|$|Regimental aid posts {{were cleared}} {{of the first}} rush of cases by [...] though minor gas {{casualties}} trickled in for another [...] For a few days, small numbers of soldiers reported with symptoms of bronchitis, which were attributed to the gas. Casualties were evacuated {{as soon as possible}} from the aid posts to the field ambulances, severe cases first albeit slowly, because all troops suffering from the gas were treated as lying cases and carried by hand or on wheeled <b>stretchers.</b> <b>Cases</b> admitted at Lindenhoek, were evacuated by a thirty-minute car journey, to the main station at Locre Hospice. Some casualties arrived at Locre within three hours of the gas attack and all cases were detained for several hours, until some improvement was seen. Lighter cases were sent on to casualty clearing stations first and some of the worst cases were retained for treatment, to spare them the effects of another journey, as the unit had good accommodation.|$|R
