40|$|This book explores how {{different}} publics {{make sense of}} and evaluate anti-terrorism powers within the UK, {{and the implications of}} this for citizenship and security. Drawing on primary empirical research, the book argues that whilst white individuals are not unconcerned about the effects of anti-terrorism, ethnic minority citizens (including, but not only those identifying as Muslim) believe that anti-terrorism powers have impacted negatively on their citizenship and security. This book thus offers the first systematic engagement with 'vernacular' or 'everyday' understandings of anti-terrorism policy, citizenship and security. It argues that while transformations in anti-terrorism frameworks impact on public experiences of <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>citizenship,</b> they do not do so in a uniform, homogeneous, or predictable manner. At the same time, public understandings and expectations of <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>citizenship</b> themselves shape how developments in anti-terrorism frameworks are discussed and evaluated. This important new book will be of interest to researchers and students working {{in a wide range of}} disciplines including Political Science, International Relations, Security Studies and Sociology...|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies of}} how insecurities are {{socially}} and politically constituted develop sophisticated dystopian sociologies of security practice. They emphasize that {{security is a}} technique of exclusion, discrimination and/or unmaking the political capacity of subjects. Yet, such {{an understanding of the}} politics of insecurity {{is only part of the}} story. Securitized subjects do not always passively enact discriminations and de-politicizations; they also produce cracks in securitizing processes. The chapter proposes to correct the dystopian focus of the analytics of securitizing by taking citizenship seriously as a category through which political being is analyzed. This proposal is not unproblematic, and it is certainly not the only way to pose an analytics of being political in dystopian visions of securitizing. It is however not an insignificant one either, especially in those sites, situations and moments where <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>citizenship</b> have again become central to the formulation of political life. We first highlight the key political elements in work on securitizing, and then introduce a conception of citizenship which retains its ambiguous history of being both an institution of domination and exclusion and a mode of empowering subjugated, excluded, and alienated people. Finally, we propose the interstitial between <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>citizenship</b> as a method of analyzing the political practice of those considered as alienated or excluded from politics, and thus of bringing them within the political scene...|$|E

We approach such systems from the perspective of large-scale high-volume public deployments. We find that various characteristics of such deployments present a trade-off, where emphasis on one undermines the other. Such characteristic trade-off spaces are described and explored in this paper. The ultimate contribution lies in the understanding of such trade-off spaces for the purposes of optimal design of such systems.

Building on concepts of social <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>citizenship</b> as an analytical frame, it shows that the Croatian nationality became not only an ideological perspective, but a practical means to achieving social rights, including access to housing. However, this logic was rather shortsighted. While many Croatian settlers as well as Croatian returnees came to Knin with enthusiasm, they became frustrated by the limited access to social and material benefits in the post-war, postsocialist situation and the diminishing power of national rights from 1998 on. The region of Knin became marginalized and 'de-modernised' and many 'national winners' became social losers. With the fragmentation of national solidarity, people in the Knin region started to construct a (fragile) local society, giving hope for the emergence of civil processes...|$|E

Continuities between citizenship education and â€˜preparednessâ€™, emphasis on citizenship education against particular conceptions of extremism, and adult education initiatives such as the Citizen Corps are examined through critical policy analysis. Although these initiatives are embedded with{{in national}} histories and polities, the continuities between earlier citizenship initiatives in the Cold War and current initiatives in what has been promoted as the â€˜war on terrorâ€™ are emphasized.

30|$|Where Danish {{debates on}} naturalization remain highly politicized, tied {{to issues of}} deservingness, {{cultural}} assimilation, <b>security,</b> <b>and</b> ideas about <b>citizenship</b> as something sacred, which should be difficult (Mouritsen & Olsen, 2013), Norwegian debates have been less protracted and discourses less harsh. They have centered on concern that new citizens {{should be able to}} belong and have undivided political loyalty â€“ hence Norwayâ€™s continuing resistance to dual citizenship â€“ as well the vulnerability of Norway as a small language community. Yet, despite introduction of a light language requirement, an oath of allegiance, and mandatory participation in an integration program (without tests), citizenship is now, unlike previously and in sharp contrast to Denmark, a legal entitlement (MidtbÃ¸en, 2015).

40|$|This book {{engages the}} intense {{relationship}} between <b>citizenship</b> <b>and</b> <b>security</b> in modern politics. It focuses {{on questions of}} citizenship in security analysis in order to critically evaluate how political being is and can be constituted in relation to securitising practices. In light of contemporary issues and events such as human rights regimes, terrorism, identity control, commercialisation of <b>security,</b> diaspora, <b>and</b> border policies, this book addresses a citizenship deficit in security studies. The chapters introduce several key political themes that characterise the interplays between <b>citizenship</b> <b>and</b> security: changes in citizenship regimes, the renewed insecurity of citizenship-state relations, the emerging ways by which the political and national communities are crafted, and the ways democratic societies and regimes react in times of insecurity. Approaching citizenship as both a governmental practice and a resource of political contestation, the book aims to highlight what political challenges and contestations are created in situations where security intensely meets citizenship today.

40|$|Policy, media, {{activist and}} {{academic}} discourses often portray migrants and {{refugees in the}} extreme, as victims or villains. This portrayal obscures the agency demonstrated by migrants and refugees and evidenced in their own accounts of their journeys. It also reifies {{the power of the}} state to â€˜secureâ€™ borders and control migration, and conceals the contested politics of mobility and security visible in negotiations between migrants, borders guards, smugglers, fishermen, and other actors. In this article, I take an ethnographic approach and conceptualize the border from the bottom up as a contested site of negotiation. The analysis reveals the ways in which migrants negotiate with their smugglers, amongst themselves, and with border guards in order to circumvent state controls when entering the state clandestinely. In doing so, it questions traditional conceptualizations of sovereignty, <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>citizenship.</b> The article then analyses how migrants continue to demonstrate agency after arrival within state territories and how this agency can have an impact not only on micro, everyday encounters, but also on the macro level: my research demonstrates how migrant agency can have causal and constitutive effects on state relations and power. The article draws on participant observation and over 130 interviews I conducted with migrants, refugees, fishermen, NGO representations, and policymakers between 2007 and 2015 in Malta and Cyprus...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} {{the recent}} measures {{taken by the}} Municipality of Rio de Janeiro concerning public security {{in the context of}} several international events being organised in the city, including the 2016 Olympic Games. Falling {{within the framework of the}} Federal Programme of <b>Security</b> <b>and</b> <b>Citizenship</b> (Pronasci), these measures aim first and foremost at improving security in several favelas of the city by establishing so-called Pacifying Police Units (UPP). With the study of spatial logics prevailing in the establishment of these units in strategically selected districts, associated with that of the daily practices of residents in several favelas of Rio alongside community-based police forces, we were able to characterise the close link between public security and urban policies. Beyond the displayed objectives of social peace preservation, we examine this link to question the permanence of social difficulties experienced by the majority of favela residents, and to question the underlying land and real estate stakes revealed by these actions. Does the evolution of intervention methods in urban public security, which appears to be closely related to territorial marketing strategies, reflect the unequal and possibly unfair treatment of some of the poorest areas of the city, or does it, on the contrary, lead to considering new means of security provision in areas highly affected by violence, poverty and a lack of public services...|$|E
