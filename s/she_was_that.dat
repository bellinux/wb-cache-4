5|$|Scully visits Kresge, {{wanting to}} look further into Roberta Sim's suicide, {{despite the fact}} that the police think it is a simple suicide. Scully finds a {{striking}} resemblance between the Sims' daughter, Emily, and her sister Melissa from when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> age. Scully flashes back to a funeral she attended when she was a little girl but imagines Marshall Sim holding her hand. Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to believe that she was anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used hypodermic needle, which Marshall claims was used for injecting the anemic Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave her up for adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas.|$|E
500|$|Among those {{attending}} at the Tyburn House was Abraham Thornton, {{the son of}} a builder from Castle Bromwich. Thornton was about 24years old and heavyset; descriptions of him range from [...] "well-looking young fellow" [...] to [...] "of repulsive appearance". When he saw Ashford, he inquired of another male attendee who <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> <b>That</b> party-goer later alleged that, upon being told who she was, Thornton stated that he had been intimate with her sister three times, and would also be with Mary Ashford, or he would die for it. Thornton later denied this statement, which was a major source of the public animus towards him following his arrest. During the course of the evening, he was very attentive to Ashford, and she appeared to enjoy his company.|$|E
500|$|The {{funeral was}} held at the Congregational Church on Wilshire Boulevard. Earp's pallbearers were William J. Hunsaker, (Earp's {{attorney}} in Tombstone and noted Los Angeles attorney); Jim Mitchell (Los Angeles Examiner reporter and Hollywood screenwriter); George W. Parsons (founding member of Tombstone's [...] "Committee of Vigilance"); Wilson Mizner (a friend of Wyatt's during the Klondike Gold Rush); John Clum (a good friend from his days in Tombstone, former Tombstone mayor, and editor of The Tombstone Epitaph); William S. Hart (good friend and Western actor and silent film star); and Tom Mix (friend and Western film star). Mitchell wrote Wyatt's local obituary. The newspapers reported that Tom Mix cried during his friend's service. When Josephine did not attend Wyatt's funeral, Grace Spolidora was furious. [...] "She didn't go to his funeral, even. She wasn't that upset. She was peculiar. I don't think <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> devastated when he died." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear Ida, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{clever and}} {{superior}} that a master {{in music and}} French <b>is</b> all <b>she</b> would want. Besides, you know, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> delicate. Connie <b>is</b> the bookish one; <b>she</b> <b>is</b> so eager about the examination that she will go on at her school; though I would have taken her away from such a low place at once.' ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{it stands}} proven and {{established}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Mary and isn't, and thought <b>she</b> <b>was</b> and knows <b>she</b> wasn't. <b>That</b> much <b>is</b> clear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>she</b> {{must always}} <b>be</b> doing {{something}} extraordinary. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> kind of girl, I fancy. Do you think her pretty, Mr. Vandernoodt?" ...|$|R
500|$|Elisabeth's {{body was}} placed in a silver casket, a gift from Nicholas II, for the journey back to Darmstadt. Her father {{arranged}} a white funeral, with white instead of black for the funeral trappings, white flowers, and white horses for the procession. The Hessian people came out by the thousands to view the funeral procession and [...] "sobbed in unison so that I could hear it," [...] Ernst wrote. A cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm II, expressed shock at the child's death in a letter to Tsar Nicholas II on 7 November 1903. [...] "How joyous and merry <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> day at Wolfsgarten, when I was there, so full of life and fun and health ... What a terrible heartrending blow for poor Ernie, who doted and adored that little enchantress!" [...] Elisabeth was buried in the Rosenhöhe {{with other members of the}} Hessian grand ducal family. A marble angel was later installed to watch over her grave. In a final gesture to Elisabeth and Ernst, Victoria Melita placed her badge of the Order of Hesse, granted to her upon her marriage, into Elisabeth's coffin. Ernst was still devastated by the memory of his daughter's death thirty years later. [...] "My little Elisabeth," [...] he wrote in his memoirs, [...] "was the sunshine of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|On the topic, Krause elaborated: [...] "The {{only one}} who didn't do {{anything}} particularly heroic was Sloan. That made him being with Addison at the end even better, because she was using him to sate a desire {{and that was very}} clear." [...] Krause positively reviewed the idea of Ellis Grey's becoming temporarily lucid, deeming it [...] "amazing": [...] "She was not very endearing when she was lucid, that's for certain. She was unbelievably cruel to Meredith, telling her how disappointed <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Meredith was merely ordinary. Ouch. But she did a great thing this episode too, during her short time as a sane person. She gave Cristina the answer she was looking for." [...] The arc involving Callie and George's sudden marriage, named by Krause [...] "a roller coaster", was described as being a way to emphasize the contrast between the two. Krause also noted the contrast between Stevens' kindhearted personality in the past, and the cruelty she proves to have in the episode, which was noted to have been [...] "a highlight in perfect fashion", as well as a reminder for the multi-dimensional personalities of the characters. Also noted was Cristina's way of accepting Burke's proposal, following Ellis' answer, which gave her the hope she had been previously looking for.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, Carl Friedan {{had been}} {{quoted as saying}} [...] "She changed the course of history almost singlehandedly. It took a driven, super aggressive, egocentric, almost lunatic dynamo to rock the world the way she did. Unfortunately, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> same person at home, where that kind of conduct doesn't work. She simply never {{understood}} this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her {{and educated}} her, to be loved. I {{developed}} her into what <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> might <b>be</b> loved. Love her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} not," [...] said Lance. [...] "Clement, I fear there <b>is</b> no doubt <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> singing Hungarian {{woman who was}} the ruin of Edgar's life." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thatcher {{saw only}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> pained, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> helpless: <b>that</b> <b>was</b> enough. [...] "It <b>is</b> {{possible}} <b>that</b> your uncle {{may have been}} deceived," [...] he began; [...] "many honest men have been fooled by clever but deceitful tricksters, men and women--" ...|$|R
2500|$|Wyatt died on January 13, 1929. Grace Welsh and her {{sister-in-law}} Alma were [...] the legal witnesses to Wyatt's cremation. Josephine was apparently {{too full of}} grief to assist or to attend the funeral itself. Grace was upset that Josephine didn't attend. [...] "She didn't go to his funeral, even. She wasn't that upset. She was peculiar. I don't think <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> devastated when he died." [...] After Wyatt's death, Josephine told her friends and family to stop calling her Sadie, Wyatt's name for her, and insisted they call her Josie.|$|E
2500|$|Fernández was {{the very}} first {{successful}} Afro-Puerto Rican female singer, and as such, she broke color barriers and stereotypes. The Mingo band was contracted to perform at {{a benefit for the}} American Red Cross in the Condado Vanderbilt Hotel on August 4, 1945. The director of the orchestra told her that according to the hotel's rules, she had to enter through the kitchen door like all other black musicians (a de facto integration rule, illegal at the time in Puerto Rico, but still in place at the time out of concern for American patrons of the hotel). Ruth however, did not follow the instructions and entered through the main entrance, driven by a chauffeur on a Packard automobile. She went on stage and performed before the astonished audience. When asked in a documentary years later how she felt about the incident, she replied: [...] "Me llamaron negra. ¿Negra? ¿Y qué?" [...] ("They called me a negro. Negro? So what?"). She was particularly proud about how well dressed <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> day, [...] "wearing more decorations than Douglas MacArthur". From that point on she proudly and constantly referred to herself (even in songs such as [...] "Soy la que soy") as [...] "La Negra de Ponce" [...] ("The Black Woman from Ponce)", making reference to her racial heritage [...] and her city of origin. She often also joked that she considered herself [...] "Insoportablemente Ponceña" [...] ("unbearably Ponceña").|$|E
2500|$|Diana Oughton left Dwight {{at the age}} of 14 {{to finish}} her high school {{education}} at the Madeira School in McLean, Virginia. Madeira provided a conservative education. In her senior year at Madeira, she was accepted by all of the Seven Sisters colleges. Oughton graduated high school in 1959, entering Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania as a German-language major. Oughton supported her Republican family's political values by opposing federal banking regulations, social security, and anything associated with big government. When she was 19, Oughton went to West Germany, under a program sponsored by Wayne State University of Detroit, to spend her junior year of college at the University of Munich. She rented a room from the former rector of the university, Gerhard Weber. Oughton became close friends with some of the German students. One such student was Peter, with whom she had conversations late into the night. In the family-authorized biography, Diana: The Making of a Terrorist, author Thomas Powers noted Diana's recollection of a conversation with Peter that resonated with her: [...] "He said...Hurrah for Socialism!" [...] After her study abroad, Oughton returned to Bryn Mawr for her senior year. It was during this year that it became apparent to her that America's young people had grown up in the silent fifties as observers and listeners. In the early sixties, young people saw that what they had been taught to believe had fallen short. During this time, Oughton and many other students read and were influenced by the book Black Like Me. The author, John Howard Griffin, gave an account of what he encountered going to the Southern United States, disguised as an African American. The book {{had a profound effect on}} Oughton, prompting her to volunteer in 1962 to tutor African American children in an impoverished section of Philadelphia. Once, Oughton told her sister Carol how amazed <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there were seventh graders she was tutoring who couldn't read.|$|E
