25|$|In a magician's {{house on}} another island, Lucy {{attempts}} {{to perform a}} spell {{that would make her}} tragically beautiful, despite being warned of negative consequences. Just as she is about to say the words, however, she sees an image of Aslan snarling at her, frightening her from reading the spell (in the 2010 film, she reads the spell and turns into a version of Susan and finds her brothers have not heard of Lucy or Narnia). Aslan also reprimands her for using another spell to see what her friends <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> She encounters a story-spell that she feels is the best story ever that disappears after she reads it, and Aslan reassures her that she will be able to read it again.|$|E
500|$|In the B story, Andy (Chris Pratt) still pines for April (Aubrey Plaza), {{who remains}} angry at Andy {{and is now}} dating the {{handsome}} Eduardo (Carlo Mendez). Chris (Rob Lowe) suggests Andy tap into the aspects of his personality April was attracted to in the first place. However, the only things he can think of are that he is nice and {{he is in a}} band. Andy decides to be nice to Eduardo, and the two realize they have similar musical tastes (they both like the Dave Matthews Band) and end up bonding over a guitar session. April becomes frustrated because she only dated Eduardo to make Andy jealous. She dumps Eduardo, which Chris interprets as a sign that his efforts are succeeding. Ann (Rashida Jones), who was nervous about Andy and Chris spending time together, is relieved when Chris tells her that Andy had nothing but positive things to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> The episode ends with the Pawnee residents [...] including Kelly and his daughter [...] watching an outdoor screening of the Twilight film.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Zofia Burr, {{who calls}} Angelou's poetry [...] "unabashedly public in its ambitions", connects Angelou's lack of {{critical}} acclaim {{to both the}} public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou's popular success, and to critics' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal, performed one. Bloom agrees, stating that Angelou's acclaim has been public rather than critical. Critic James Finn Cotter, in his review of Oh Pray, calls it an [...] "unfortunate example {{of the dangers of}} success" [...] and states that Angelou's fame has [...] "muted the private and personal quality that it takes to be essential to poetry". Critic John Alfred Avant, {{despite the fact that the}} volume was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, states that Diiie [...] "isn't accomplished, not by any means". Even critics who value poetry as an oral tradition devalue Angelou's poetry; critic Bryan D. Bourn, who praises her for using African oral tradition, states that she [...] "slips into banality when she abandons" [...] them and criticizes her for not catering to poetry critics. Scholar Joanne Braxton asserts that [...] "Angelou's audience, composed largely of women and blacks, isn't really affected by what white and/or male critics of the dominant literary tradition have to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> work. This audience does not read literary critics; it does read Maya Angelou". Burr condemns Angelou's critics for their narrow view of poetry, which has resulted in their negative reviews of her poetry, and for not taking into account Angelou's larger purposes in her writing: [...] "to be representative rather than individual, authoritative rather than confessional".|$|E

2500|$|Kareena Kapoor, who {{had before}} enjoyed only {{some success in}} her films, had catapulted herself to {{becoming}} one of Bollywood's superstars. Her character, Geet Dhillon, {{has become one of}} the most popular and recognizable heroines in Bollywood. She later went on to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> role, [...] "To play a character like 'Geet' doesn't happen all the time; it just happens. When you begin working on a film, you of course know about the story and your character. However, no one knows how audiences would eventually react to it. 'Geet' did strike a chord with the audiences and became a household name." [...] Kareena Kapoor, for her performance, was ranked number 66 in Filmfare magazine's 80 Iconic Bollywood Performances list. According to Hindi Film News, she was number 5 in the critic's top ten and number 4 in the popular top ten for the finest performance by a Bollywood actress for the decade.

2500|$|When {{the amateur}} court theatre was {{replaced}} by professional actors in 1783, she continued to sing and act in informal settings. She also began to teach singing and took up writing and art. She formally withdrew from all court performing in 1788. She became friends with Friedrich Schiller during those years, whose poems she later set to music. Unfortunately, these lieder are lost, as are her two dramas, hundreds of arias and duets, and an autobiography given to Goethe in 1778. However, two collections of lieder were published by her, the first in 1786, followed by another in 1794, thus surviving into the present time. The first collection, which contains her rendition of Der Erlkönig from Goethe's play, was more popular than the second, probably due to its simpler nature: the second contained many songs in French and Italian. These two collections {{are some of the}} first and largest publications of lieder by a woman.
