40|$|Subject of investigation: {{process of}} sawing of wood {{particle}} boards by circular <b>saws.</b> Purpose of <b>the</b> work: substantiation of the rational parameters of <b>the</b> circular <b>saw</b> teeth and <b>sawing</b> conditions. <b>The</b> theoretical results include {{the study and}} determination {{of the influence of}} technological and tool factors on the power, energy and qualitative characteristics of <b>the</b> process of <b>sawing</b> of wood particle boards by circular saws; specification of the peculiar dependences of the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>sawing</b> conditions on <b>the</b> geometry of <b>the</b> <b>saw</b> teeth; development of a mathematical model for sawing of wood particle boards by <b>the</b> circular <b>saws.</b> <b>The</b> work substantiates the rational parameters of circular <b>saw</b> teeth and <b>the</b> conditions of <b>sawing</b> of wood particle boards which provide for lower power consumption and for a high quality of <b>the</b> <b>sawn</b> surface. <b>The</b> rational parameters are substantiated for <b>the</b> circular <b>saws</b> and for <b>the</b> conditions of <b>sawing</b> of wood particle boards by <b>the</b> circular <b>saws.</b> <b>The</b> use of <b>the</b> improved circular <b>saws</b> and sawing conditions makes it possible to decrease the extent of chipping of the edges of wood particle boards, to reduce power consumption in sawing and to prolong the durability of toolsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

40|$|The {{position}} of the first metatarsal following a crescentic osteotomy for hallux valgus {{is a function of}} the size of <b>the</b> <b>saw</b> cut and orientation of the osteotomy. This study reports the effect of these variables, recommended tech-nique, and potential pitfalls when using the crescent os-teotomy. Using molded polyurethane foam metatarsals and a precision drill press which controlled <b>the</b> <b>saw</b> cuts, <b>the</b> following variables were studied: (1) orientation of <b>the</b> <b>saw</b> cut to <b>the</b> metatarsal, (2) <b>the</b> <b>saw</b> size (diameter of <b>the</b> <b>saw</b> relative to <b>the</b> shaft width of the osteotomy site), and (3) the direction toward which the crescent faces (proximal/distal). Best correction can be obtained if <b>the</b> <b>saw</b> diameter is larger than the diameter of the osteotomy site (allowing a greater degree of correction before im-pingement), <b>the</b> <b>saw</b> tip is tilted slightly toward the sesa-moids (which ensures that the metatarsal does not rotate medially with correction), and <b>the</b> <b>saw</b> is rotated laterally to cause slight declination of the toe...|$|R
