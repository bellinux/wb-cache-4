50|$|The I-351-class {{submarine}} (I-san-byaku-go-jū-ichi-gata sensuikan) was a {{class of}} tanker/transport submarines built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during World War II. The IJN called this type of submarine Senho type submarine (Sen-Ho-gata sensuikan). The type name, was shortened to Hokyū Sensuikan (<b>Submarine</b> <b>Tanker).</b> The IJN designed these submarines to support flying boats in forward areas. By the time the first submarine was finished, this capability was no longer needed and she was converted into an oil tanker. That boat, I-351, was sunk on the return leg of her second voyage in 1945; the second boat was destroyed by an American air raid before she was completed. Four additional submarines were planned, but were cancelled before they were laid down.|$|E

40|$|The dual need to {{discover}} {{new sources of}} energy and to achieve energy self-sufficiency {{has resulted in a}} search for petroleum resources in the North American Arctic by the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. Petroleum has been discovered in many localities on land, and increasingly, offshore. A number of these are potential commercial fields. A considerable amount of development has already taken place, and full production will be possible at many of the sites by the early 1990 s. However, transport systems to bring this new found wealth to world markets are as yet far from fully developed, and are a problem. While there are two and possibly three potential transport technologies, all are e 4 pensive, high risk "megaprojects" which are unlikely to be ready for transporting the petroleum when it is ready to be transported. The author presents what he believes to be a more versatile and economically viable transport technology: the Arctic Transport Submarine. The Arctic submarine, the history of which is given in the first chapters, is an accomplished fact. Its modification for commercial purposes, given in a later chapter, can be readily achieved. The author reviews: High Arctic petroleum finds and developments, particularly offshore; the characteristics of the "mega-project" alternatives (pipelines, ice-breaker <b>tankers,</b> and giant <b>submarine</b> <b>tankers),</b> existent and proposed; and the obstacles-financial, political, environmental and physical [...] that confront any potential Arctic Transport developer. He discusses the advantages and vulnerabilities of each of the transport technologies in face of these obstacles; and concludes with why a prototype "Arctic" submarine, with or without towed cargo containers, is now deserving of developmental attention...|$|R
25|$|The tanker and {{container}} variants {{would follow}} the same design as standard military nuclear <b>submarines,</b> with the <b>tanker</b> variant carrying almost 30,000 tons of petroleum, to be loaded and discharged from surface or underwater terminals. The container carrier was to transport 912 standard (20-foot) freight containers, loaded within 30 hours through hatches, assisted by internal conveyance systems. However, these plans came to nothing in the hard financial straits following the Dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|As Tang poured on {{full speed}} {{to escape the}} gunfire {{directed}} at her, a destroyer passed around {{the stern of the}} transport and headed for the <b>submarine.</b> The <b>tanker</b> exploded, and a hit was seen on the transport. A few seconds later, the destroyer exploded, either from intercepting Tangs third torpedo or from shell fire of two escorts closing on the beam. Only the transport remained afloat, dead in the water. The submarine cleared to 240 ft, rechecked the last two torpedoes which had been loaded in the bow tubes, and returned to finish off the transport. The 23rd torpedo was fired at 900 yd and was observed running hot, straight, and normal. Tangs score for the night would later be confirmed as the freighters Kogen Maru (6600 tons) and Matsumoto Maru (7000 tons).|$|R

40|$|Exploitation of {{the ocean}} floor for {{commercial}} or military use requires not only Remotely Oper-ated Vehicles (ROVs), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), submersibles, and diving systems; it also requires 1 -atmosphere enclosures permanently-or semipermanently-affixed to the ocean floor. These 1 -atmosphere enclosures would serve as habitats for the crews, covers for mine shafts, and pressure-existent buildings for ore or food-processing plants. Bottom-mounted pressure-resistant enclosures must be negatively buoyant, instead of positively buoyant (as they are with pressure hulls for submersibles). This allows them to be constructed from inexpensive materials with low specific compressive strength. The primary choice for such applications is Portland cement concrete, since it is inexpensive, can be cast in situ, does not deteriorate under long-term immersion, and has a fair specific compressive strength. In fact, its specific compressive strength is high enough to qualify the material as a viable candidate for use in constructing large <b>submarine</b> oil <b>tankers</b> that require pressure hulls with only mar-ginal positive buoyancy. Since concrete has not previously been used for constructing pressure-resistant shells for ocean engineering structures, there was a total absence of engineering data {{on which to base}} the design o...|$|R
50|$|After the Battle of Midway the IJN {{immediately}} {{planned a}} transport submarine. The type {{was based on}} the U 155 Deutschland. Her duties were transportation of troops (110 men, 10 tons freight and 2 landing crafts) in the areas where the enemy had air superiority. Later the demands for her were changed in sequence. The final demands were 65 tons in the hull and 25 tons on the upper deck (freight only). In the beginning the IJN did not intend to equip these boats with torpedoes. Later, after strong demands from the front commanders, it was decided to equip them with torpedoes for self-defense. The I-372 class was designed as a <b>tanker</b> <b>submarine</b> based on the I-361 class. They were not allowed to be loaded with torpedoes.|$|R
50|$|From 1943 Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine {{operated}} several radar-equipped night fighter guide ships (Nachtjagdleitschiffe), including NJL Togo. {{which was}} equipped with a FuMG A1 Freya radar for early warning and a Würzburg-Riese gun laying radar, plus night fighter communications equipment.From October 1943, the NJL Togo cruised the Baltic Sea under the operational control of the Luftwaffe. In March 1944, after the three great Soviet bombing raids on Helsinki, she arrived in the Gulf of Finland to provide night fighter cover for Tallinn and Helsinki. Also, the Imperial Japanese Navy briefly modified two Ha-101 class submarines as dedicated radar pickets {{in the first half}} of 1945, but reconverted them to an even more important role as <b>tanker</b> <b>submarines</b> in June of that year.|$|R
2500|$|On {{her third}} war patrol, the {{submarine}} proceeded westward from Pearl Harbor 16 January 1944 {{bound for the}} South China Sea. Prowling the pivotal Singapore-Japan shipping lanes, she encountered convoy Hi-40 of five large oil tankers with three escorts early 19 February. The submarine reached attack position at about 04:40 and fired three torpedoes, scoring one hit. She then began an [...] "end around," [...] a long circling maneuver designed to bring {{her in front of}} the remaining four tankers, and late that afternoon she was again ready to attack. Two torpedoes sank two more of the frantically zigzagging ships, and Jack moved in on the trailing tanker. Her first spread of torpedoes missed and the tanker replied with a salvo from [...] guns, but Jack returned three hours later to sink her with four torpedoes. In this remarkable series of attacks, the <b>submarine</b> sank four <b>tankers</b> (earning the nickname [...] "Jack the Pack", after the convoy commander radioed that he was under attack from a [...] "wolfpack"), all over 5,000tons: Kokuie Maru, Nanei Maru, Nichirin Maru, and Ichiyo Maru. After several more attacks Jack set course for Fremantle, Australia, her new base, where she arrived 13 March 1944.|$|R
2500|$|... 21 September was Triggers best day. She was patrolling some [...] {{north of}} the Hoka Sho light when she sighted a convoy of three tankers and three freighters {{protected}} by Japanese planes. The <b>submarine</b> attacked the <b>tankers</b> first, firing three torpedoes at the leader and three at the second. One hit aft was seen on the lead tanker, and flames shot over [...] into the air. The target's crew, dressed in whites, could be seen running forward to escape the fire. One torpedo hit the second tanker amidships, and it broke in half beneath the stack and sank immediately. Trigger turned and fired three stern tubes at the third tanker. This target swung toward the submarine, and all three torpedoes missed. Trigger then fired another torpedo which hit that ship's starboard side. When the submarine went deep, Dornin slipped and fell into the periscope well as the quartermaster was lowering it. He supported himself on his elbows, and the quartermaster heard his shouts in time to prevent a serious accident. Sonar reported two more explosions before the submarine came back up to periscope depth to resume the attack. Trigger fired two bow torpedoes at the third freighter in the column and scored two hits on the target which went down by the bow. The submarine then made two more attacks on the freighter, but all of her torpedoes either missed or were duds. During the three and one-half hours of action, Trigger sank two tankers, Shiriya and Shoyo Maru, and a freighter, Argun Maru, {{for a total of}} 20,660tons of enemy shipping. The submarine returned to Midway on 30 September to be refitted and rearmed.|$|R
