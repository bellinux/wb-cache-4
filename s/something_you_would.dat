500|$|After Homer quits {{his job at}} {{the power}} plant, he violently tosses his old boss Mr. Burns out of the cart he is driving. Homer then drives across a wooden bridge and tosses a match onto it; the whole bridge is {{instantly}} engulfed in flames. Mirkin came up with the joke, and said that [...] "the thing with animation is that you can stage almost anything and time it perfectly, <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{not be able to do}} in live action". As a live-action director, Mirkin said he enjoys the amount of control they have in animation.|$|E
500|$|... "Pusher Love Girl" [...] {{opens with}} a [...] "swirling" [...] of [...] "luscious" [...] strings, which Nate Jones of Popdust cited as being [...] "straight from a Hollywood classic". Allan Raible of ABC News wrote that the [...] "stringed fanfare" [...] is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> expect to hear {{on the red carpet}} of an awards ceremony. Jim Farber of the Daily News called the opening [...] "classic enough" [...] for Michael Jackson. After the [...] "sweeping" [...] orchestral intro, the song transcends into a [...] "funky main section", which, {{according}} to Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph, is a [...] "sweet slice of funk-soul seduction". According to Thomas, [...] "Pusher Love Girl" [...] starts off like a [...] "classic Sinatra song": with a [...] "rise of strings" [...] that [...] "hit a pitch before dropping into a neo-soul sound".|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Pride and Prejudice was overwhelmingly positive. Gerard Gilbert of The Independent recommended the opening {{episode of the}} serial one day before the British premiere, saying the television adaptation is [...] "probably {{as good as it}} [...] The casting in particular deserves a tilt at a BAFTA, Firth not being in the slightest bit soft and fluffy [...] and Jennifer Ehle showing the right brand of spirited intelligence as Elizabeth." [...] He considered Benjamin Whitrow a [...] "real scene-stealer with his Mr. Bennet", but was undecided about Alison Steadman's portrayal of Mrs. Bennet. Reviewing the first episode for the same newspaper on the day after transmission, Jim White praised Andrew Davies for [...] "injecting into the proceedings a pace and energy which at last provides a visual setting to do justice to the wit of the book. With everyone slinging themselves about at high speed (the dances, in a first for the genre, actually involve a bit of sweat), it looks like people are doing <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never have suspected they did in Austen's time: having fun." ...|$|E

I lose my job, I go away from my wife and childrens, {{but it is not}} for me, it is for all, to get better things for all,--freedoms for all.|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. Mike Reiss, show runner of The Simpsons with Al Jean at the time, said Meyer wrote most of the episode by himself without help from the show's other writers. Few changes {{were made to the}} first draft that he pitched to the producers; it was near identical to the final script. The episode was inspired by the vocational tests taken by several members of the show's staff when they went to school; Reiss, for example, said he was told he would become a librarian. Jean said [...] "one of the first things that sold us on doing the episode" [...] was the idea of Bart becoming a policeman. He said it was [...] "a funny, realistic depiction of what a kid like Bart might wind up to become, and it wasn't <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> immediately think of." [...] Jean said the episode deals with the emotion that many adults feel when they grow older and realize that {{they are not going to}} achieve the dreams they once had. [...] " [...] how people in life cope with that problem. Maybe Lisa, at eight years old, is a little bit young to worry about that, but that's what we were trying to explore here." ...|$|E
500|$|That {{was one of}} {{the first}} words I said to the entire team at ILM. I said, [...] "This movie needs to be theatrical, operatic, romantic." [...] We used a lot of words not usually {{associated}} with high-tech blockbusters … We went for a very, very, very, very saturated color palette for the battle for Hong Kong. I kept asking John to tap into his inner Mexican and be able to saturate the greens and the purples and the pinks and the oranges. The classic Japanese woodblock print The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai was a common motif in the ocean battles; Del Toro recalled, [...] "I would say 'Give me a Hokusai wave'… we use the waves and weather in the movie very operatically." [...] The director asked that Knoll not necessarily match the lighting from shot to shot: [...] "It's pretty unorthodox to do that, but I think the results are really beautiful and very artistically free and powerful, not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> associate with a big sci-fi action movie." [...] Del Toro considers the film's digital water its most exciting visual effect: [...] "The water dynamics in this movie are technically beautiful, but also artistically incredibly expressive. We agreed on making the water become almost another character. We would time the water very precisely. I'd say 'Get out of the wave [...]'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Carry Out" [...] is one {{of twelve}} songs written and {{produced}} by Timbaland and J-Roc for Timbaland's third studio album Shock Value II (2009). Justin Timberlake, Attitude and Jim Beanz, notable collaborators with Timbaland, also assisted {{in the writing of}} the song. Timbaland, in an interview with MTV's Shaheem Reed and Gil Kaufman, stated that he favored this song over other recordings because the process for creating the song was similar to those of other collaborations they have done. Timberlake would come into the studio and listen to the track. Afterwards, he would then compose the lyrics in his head. Upon explaining their method of making music, Timbaland stated that: [...] "We got a chemistry that cannot be described. People ask, 'Well, what are you and Justin like?' Can't tell you what it's like — it's a chemistry that can't be described. <b>Something</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have to see for yourself and be, like, 'Them two got magic'." [...] Timbaland stated that the song resembles a [...] "2010 version" [...] of Snoop Dogg's [...] "Drop It Like It's Hot", produced by The Neptunes. He also revealed that the intention of the song was to provide a different slang for women: [...] "Instead of 'Your phat butt' or 'Your big breasts,' we say, 'Oh, I need you. Can I be your carry out? Be my carry out. I want you to be my dinner, my leftovers, my everything.' It's a different slang. We're grown men, I wanna be subliminal to females. Like, 'Oooh, carry out? That's kinda sexy'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Production Designer Dennis Gassner says of {{his work}} on the film: “The whole project is about {{translation}}– translation from <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> understand into something that is in a different vernacular. So, it’s a new signature, looking into another world that seems familiar but is still unique. There’s a term I use– called 'cludging'– it’s taking one element and combining it with another element to make something new. It’s a hybrid or amalgamation, and that’s what this movie is about from a design perspective. It’s about amalgamating ideas and concepts and theoretical and physical environments.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Cornelius didn't go {{away after}} {{delivering}} the paper. Brown {{was sitting up}} over a tiny fire; all the others were lying down. [...] "I could tell you <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like to know," [...] Cornelius mumbled crossly. Brown paid no attention. [...] "You did not kill him," [...] went on the other, [...] "and {{what do you get}} for it? You might have had money from the Rajah, besides the loot of all the Bugis houses, and now you get nothing." [...] "You had better clear out from here," [...] growled Brown, without even looking at him. But Cornelius let himself drop by his side and began to whisper very fast, touching his elbow from time to time. What he had to say made Brown sit up at first, with a curse. He had simply informed him of Dain Waris's armed party down the river. At first Brown saw himself completely sold and betrayed, but a moment's reflection convinced him that there could be no treachery intended. He said nothing, and after a while Cornelius remarked, in a tone of complete indifference, that there was another way out of the river which he knew very well. [...] "A good thing to know, too," [...] said Brown, pricking up his ears; and Cornelius began to talk of what went on in town and repeated all that had been said in council, gossiping in an even undertone at Brown's ear as you talk amongst sleeping men you do not wish to wake. [...] "He thinks he has made me harmless, does he?" [...] mumbled Brown very low. [...] "Yes. He is a fool. A little child. He came here and robbed me," [...] droned on Cornelius, [...] "and he made all the people believe him. But if something happened that they did not believe him any more, where would he be? And the Bugis Dain who is waiting for you down the river there, captain, is the very man who chased you up here when you first came." [...] Brown observed nonchalantly that it would be just as well to avoid him, and with the same detached, musing air Cornelius declared himself acquainted with a backwater broad enough to take Brown's boat past Waris's camp. [...] "You will have to be quiet," [...] he said as an afterthought, [...] "for in one place we pass close behind his camp. Very close. They are camped ashore with their boats hauled up." [...] "Oh, we know how to be as quiet as mice; never fear," [...] said Brown. Cornelius stipulated that in case he were to pilot Brown out, his canoe should be towed. [...] "I'll have to get back quick," [...] he explained.|$|E

50|$|After {{developing}} the argument against a divine creator, Dawkins examines {{a number of}} designoid objects that contain imperfections, which is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not expect to find in an object that is supposedly created by a divine being. Showing the audience a halibut flatfish, he explains how they evolved from an upright swimming ancestor with one eye {{on each side of}} the head into a bottom-hugging flatfish with a distorted set of eyes on one side of the body. Dawkins claims that this is poorly designed, as any proper engineer would design an organism more like a skate, which flattened out on its belly instead of on its side. This is an example of <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> expect from an evolved/designoid object, but not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> expect from a created/designed object.|$|E

5000|$|Grell's {{dislike of}} Tyroc {{was strong enough}} that he {{deliberately}} made him look ridiculous, saying, [...] "I gave him a silly costume.
