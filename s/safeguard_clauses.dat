40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to take a closer look at the Seventh Accession Treaty and the terms of {{membership}} it provides for. The starting point is an overview of the structure, the rules on entry into force, the legal character of the Seventh Accession Treaty as well as the accession of Croatia to the Founding Treaties forming the core of EU’s primary law and some of their most recent modifications. This section is followed by analysis of the institutional provisions facilitating the phasing in of the Croatian authorities into the EU decision making machinery. It is important to take a look at both - the institutional framework for the period between the signature of the Accession Treaty and following its entry into force. This will lead to the analysis of immediate effect of EU law and threats to the effective application of EU law after the accession. Adaptations to the existing EU acquis and transitional periods are analysed in turn.

40|$|The EU {{has most}} {{frequently}} resorted to harmonisation {{as a model}} to achieve its in-ternal market. This contribution examines the dynamics of legal differentiation in EU’s internal market law laid down in Article 114 TFEU and secondary laws. It con-cludes {{that there has been}} a modest number of invocations of the derogation possibili-ties under Article 114 (4) and (5) TFEU and the <b>safeguard</b> <b>clauses.</b> The low number may be due to the fact that may both the Commission and the Courts have a very rig-id reading of the procedure whilst the grounds for invocation are very limited. This low number nevertheless does not automatically imply that Member States agree with the level of protection laid down in the EU’s harmonisation measures or that the opt out mechanisms are not relevant. Derogation mechanisms may play an important role in the negotiations of the level of protection in the draft legislative acts. This study moreover reveals that the derogation mechanisms may be important devices of regulatory adjustment and learning in the fields of public health and environmental protection in the EU. They ultimately may rather strengthen the uniformity of regula-tory requirements in the EU internal market instead of leading to regulatory diversity...|$|E

30|$|Another {{striking}} {{finding of}} the WDN survey {{is that of}} those who indicated inflation indexation of base wages a vast majority replied that wages were indexed to past inflation. The pattern was similar across all size groups and sectors. Once again, this response may {{have been influenced by}} the specific way that the indexation mechanism operated in Slovenia. As noted in Section 2, Slovenia moved away from backward indexation to forward-looking indexation in 2002, and agreements further included a <b>safeguard</b> <b>clause</b> for additional increase if actual inflation exceeded the projected or specified rate. The 2006 agreement did not explicitly include an indexation coefficient and figure for projected inflation but had a <b>safeguard</b> <b>clause.</b> This may have influenced respondents to interpret the framework as backward- looking indexation. It is difficult to decipher why indexation was considered informal by a sizeable percentage of the sample, because indexation was a key feature of collective agreements and there was a formal rule.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} macroeconomic {{and monetary}} policy-making at the European Commission, covering {{the period from}} the Rome Treaties to the Hague Summit. It {{is based on an}} analysis of public documents, archival research and interviews with former policy-makers. The paper starts with an overview of the economic philosophy of the Rome Treaties and senior macroeconomic policy-makers at the Commission, followed by an analysis of economic developments in the 1960 s. Thereafter, the focus is on three crucial macroeconomic policy documents of the period: the European Reserve Fund project in 1958, the Commission's Action Programme for the Second Stage of the EEC of October 1962 and the Barre [Barr] Memorandum of October 1969. [The Barr Plan I-III are on the Archive in the AEI-EU section - search for Barr]. The Commission’s objectives tended to be both defensive, preserving the "acquis communautaire", especially avoiding recourse to the <b>safeguard</b> <b>clauses,</b> and pro-active, stimulating the process of European integration. From an analytical point of view, the Commission focussed on the compatibility of policies between the Member States. Gradually, a typical Commission analysis developed, based on a blending of German convergence ideas with the French medium-term approach. The paper further illustrates the ascent of the Commission as an actor in the monetary area, notwithstanding the relatively limited provisions of the EEC Treaty...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{concerns}} surrounding the import (for food and feed uses or processing) of genetically modified herbicide tolerant (GMHT) oilseed rape is that, through seed spillage, the herbicide tolerance (HT) trait will escape into agricultural or semi-natural habitats, causing environmental or economic problems. Based on these concerns, three EU countries have invoked national <b>safeguard</b> <b>clauses</b> to ban the marketing of specific GMHT oilseed rape events on their territory. However, the scientific basis for the environmental and economic concerns posed by feral GMHT oilseed rape resulting from seed import spills is debatable. While oilseed rape has characteristics such as secondary dormancy and small seed size that enable it to persist and be redistributed in the landscape, the presence of ferals is not in itself an environmental or economic problem. Crucially, feral oilseed rape has not become invasive outside cultivated and ruderal habitats, and HT traits {{are not likely to}} result in increased invasiveness. Feral GMHT oilseed rape has the potential to introduce HT traits to volunteer weeds in agricultural fields, but would only be amplified if the herbicides to which HT volunteers are tolerant were used routinely in the field. However, this worst-case scenario is most unlikely, as seed import spills are mostly confined to port areas. Economic concerns revolve around the potential for feral GMHT oilseed rape to contribute to GM admixtures in non-GM crops. Since feral plants derived from cultivation (as distinct from import) occur at too low a frequency to affect the coexistence threshold of 0. 9...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, {{it is argued}} that (1) the Accession Treaties have been used in {{accordance}} with their nature and proclaimed objective: they only brought about limited changes to primary law, proper to the needs of accession and have not introduced any fundamental changes. The numerous and still growing arrangements that depart from the principle of the application of the acquis in toto on accession do not alter this conclusion. (2) The evolution, especially from the 2004 Accession Treaty onwards and predictable for the future Accession Treaties (e. g. with Turkey), shows a tendency of diversification of that legal instrument by (a) adding new and/or reinforced elements of conditionality, protracted from the pre-accession phase to the membership phase, devising new mechanisms of conditionality and control (general and specific <b>safeguard</b> <b>clauses,</b> monitoring and verification mechanisms, membership postponement clause) and thus (b) contributing to a further differentiation in two respects - as among the Member States and with regard to the core acquis. Such differentiation exists already {{on the basis of the}} constitutive treaties (“in-built constitutive treaties induced differentiation”) and is accentuated by the Accession Treaties and their transitional arrangements (“Accession Treaties induced differentiation”). Questions of differentiation acquired another dimension with the introduction of the citizenship of the EU. (3) Finally, negotiations with certain candidate countries will show whether additional innovations are to be expected: a) whether future instruments of accession would be used in order to increase the existing level of differentiation (and protract the pre-accession phase logic well into the membership phase) with the conditionality becoming the most important element of the relations within an enlarged EU and thus paradoxically negating the nature of the integration itself, b) whether they will perhaps be used to bring about more important modifications to the treaties, or c) whether they will go as far as to provide a legal basis for permanent derogations with regard to certain new Member States (as explicitly envisaged, for instance, in the negotiating framework for Turkey) ...|$|E

40|$|The Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, held in December 2005, was {{reported}} as a modest but significant {{step in the}} current trade negotiation process. To be sure, establishing detailed modalities, especially in agriculture, {{by the end of}} April 2006 remains a major challenge for WTO members. Although some progress has been made, much remains {{to be done in the}} three key areas of agricultural negotiations: market access (trade tariffs), domestic support (production subsidies) and export competition (export subsidies) before the deadline. For ACP countries, three positive factors emerged from the conference. The first concerns the commitment to remove all forms of agricultural export subsidies by 2013. The second is the decision by member states to offer more flexibility to countries of the South so that they can protect their markets (special products, deemed to be of strategic importance, especially for national food security, special <b>safeguard</b> <b>clauses</b> and mechanisms designed to protect markets against sudden waves of imports). Finally, all developed and advanced developing countries agreed to remove quotas and trade tariffs for imports from least developed countries (LDC) for 97 % of all tariff lines (tariffs defined for each product category). However, achievement of the objectives of the Doha Development Agenda will mainly depend on the willingness of the so-called G 4 the group which includes the EU, Brazil, India and the USA to take into account the needs of the poorest countries. Preference erosion is probably the main concern for ACP countries, and these, together with the LDC and the African Union member countries of the G 90, will have to continue pushing their own trade agenda and reinforcing the link with the current Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations with the EU.

40|$|The ACP–EU Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) {{is pleased}} to release the 2010 Compendium, the second in a series {{launched}} in 2009. It offers a collection of critical reviews of issues related to agricultural and fisheries trade for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries published on the Agritrade ([URL] website between 2009 and 2010. The food -price crisis of 2008 – 09, and the overall economic and financial crisis associated with high price volatility on the world markets, have contributed to undermining {{the position of a}} large number of ACP countries, which still depend heavily on trade in agricultural products. The deadlock in World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations and the rise of free -trade agreements between the European Union (EU) and other developing countries (particularly Latin America), combined with price reductions on the European market via Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, have greatly contributed to eroding the benefits of preferential access to European markets previously enjoyed by ACP countries. The latest example is the Agreement on Bananas, concluded between the EU and the Andean countries in December 2009. At the same time, ACP–EU negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), which aim to establish reciprocal market access conditions, continue to play a prominent role in the ACP-EU agenda. However, despite recent progress in the technical negotiations, a number of contentious issues remain unresolved at the time of publication, such as the clauses on most-favoured nation treatment, special <b>safeguard</b> <b>clauses,</b> infant industry protection provisions, rules of origin, etc. All these technical issues require a deep analysis of their implications for the ACP countries, to help them in their negotiations and tackle the underlying adjustments required of their economies. The Executive Briefs are updated annually and are available on the Agritrade website. This compilation aims to enhance the dissemination of information that is available to ACP stakeholders. The three main topics covered include the following issues : • agricultural trade issues – WTO negotiations, EPA negotiations, EU market access, CAP reform, food safety/SPS; • fisheries trade issues – WTO negotiations, ACP–EU Fisheries Partnership Agreements, market access, EU common fisheries policy (CFP) reform; • trade policy issues for commodities including bananas, sugar, coffee, cotton, cereals, oilseeds, beef, and fruit and vegetables. We trust the 2010 Compendium will enjoy even greater success than the 2009 publication and will continue to serve the needs of ACP stakeholders. I join the Agritrade editorial team in thanking you for your dedication, wishing you happy reading, and would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm CTA’s commitment to supporting the agricultural development agenda of ACP countries by supporting the sharing of information and experiences, facilitating ACP–EU dialogue and building capacity on issues related to agricultural and fisheries trade.

40|$|In this thesis, I study {{a policy}} process that led into a {{possibility}} {{to ban the}} cultivation of GMOs in the member states of the European Union. In practice, this happened by adding a new article to the directive 2001 / 18 /EC. Before the policy process, all the member states were required to allow the cultivation of GMOs that were authorized at the EU level. However, this prior “one-size-fits-all approach” did not work as planned. A number of member states invoked <b>safeguard</b> <b>clauses</b> to prevent the cultivation of the authorized GMO crops, while the pro-GMO countries could not cultivate as great {{of a variety of}} different GMO crops because other countries were blocking the authorization of them. In addition, because of a continuous blocking of new approvals on GMOs, the EU had in place an unofficial de facto moratorium of new GMO approvals which was problematic {{from the point of view}} of the rules of the international trade. In this thesis, I study the legislative process that led into amending the directive 2001 / 18 /EC and to some extent, renationalizing the decision-making on GMO cultivation. The focus is on the roles of the main EU decision-making bodies in the process, namely the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. The interest lied in the interplay between the institutions, the expected preferences of them and dynamics within the Council. The analysis is done by using three different approaches. The model used in this thesis regarding the expected preferences of the institutions is based on Mark. A. Pollack’s (2003) perception of the principal-agent analysis in rational choice institutionalism. In addition to this, the Parliament’s environmental ambition is analyzed by using typology developed by Burns and Carter (2010). The strategy used by the “leader” countries within the Council are analyzed by using the classification by Liefferink and Andersen (1998). Key material for this research consists of the official drafting documents of the directive, as well as journalistic reports. The method of the thesis is an intrinsic case study. The case that is studied is the policy process 2010 - 2015 that led to member states’ right to ban the cultivation of GMO crops in their territory. The decision was made under the rules of the co-decision procedure. The analysis revealed a political environment unfavorable to the continuance of the centralized approach. The Commission and the Parliament both acted in a counterintuitive manner throughout the policy process as they are generally believed to be both pro-integration and for maximizing competences, both for themselves and for the Union as a whole. A slightly deeper look into the history of the food-related risk regulation, the prevalent political environment of the time and the policy documents provide a few possible reasons for their actions such as increased Euroscepticism, that has also in the past affected in a similar manner the Commission. In addition, the analysis revealed that the Parliament demonstrated pro-environmental preferences, as it made pro-environmental amendments to the initial proposal for the directive despite many of them being blocked by the two other institutions. Still, the Parliament was able to ‘green’ the proposal, even though the final text was closer to the common position of the Council. Within the Council, a pushing effect of certain “green member states”, especially Austria’s, was prominent...|$|E

40|$|Insect-resistant genetically-modified (GM) crops {{have been}} {{developed}} to provide protection against target pests by the introduction of a Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) gene encoding various insecticidal Cry proteins. Such is the pervasiveness of this technology that the global area planted commercially with these genetically-modified Bt crops exceeded 50 million hectares in 2010. Bt maize crops engineered for toxicity to the larvae of lepidopteran pests such as the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, present a potential risk to the larvae of non-target butterflies that are not pests, but that feed {{in the vicinity of the}} crop and that might therefore be affected by toxic maize pollen. The hazard is from contact with the Bt protein by ingestion of maize pollen adhering to host plants. In North America, such a potential hazard was highlighted by a laboratory assay of Monarch butterfly larvae (Danaus plexippus) that consumed Bt maize pollen on milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) and led to extensive exposure assessments in the field in the USA. However, these found that that the amounts of maize pollen potentially ingested by monarch larvae on their host-plants in and around Bt-maize fields are unlikely to adversely affect a significant proportion of this species. However, extrapolating the monarch butterfly results to other species is problematic because of between-species variability in acute sensitivity to specific Cry 1 proteins, differences in host-plants and other ecological factors. Within Europe, although lethal and sub-lethal effects of Bt-maize pollen consumption by lepidopteran larvae have now been reported for several non-target lepidopteran species under laboratory conditions, there have been few intensive field-based studies of exposure on prominent non-target butterflies of conservation concern. Only a minority of lepidopteran species live in habitats inside arable maize ecosystems, and the larvae of those that do are often found in greater numbers on host-plants in field margins, rather than in the crop itself, because host-plant densities are usually much greater in margins than in the crop. However, the intensification of agriculture over the last 50 years has been associated with substantial losses of biodiversity in arable ecosystems. Butterflies are popular indicators of biodiversity and are in decline in arable ecosystems throughout Europe, partly as a result of farming practice. In addition, genetic modification remains a controversial area for environmental policy in Europe, where public acceptance of genetically-engineered plants is much weaker than in North America. For example, in January 2005 Hungary invoked an emergency 'safeguard clause' to attempt to ban the cultivation of the Bt-maize event MON 810 (which expresses the Cry 1 Ab protein). Despite its lack of success, this was followed in 2008 and 2009 by other EU states, including France and Germany; these <b>safeguard</b> <b>clauses</b> currently remain in place but are being challenged legally. MON 810 is the only GM crop currently cultivated on a wide scale (c. 105 ha) in Europe, mainly in Spain, but also in the Czech Republic, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Slovakia. Obtaining direct data on the mortality of non-target Lepidoptera is difficult because there are many species potentially at risk; these have different host-plants; exposure studies require good estimates of population densities of both lepidopteran species and host-plant, in both crop, margin and alternative habitats; the species at risk may be rare and have a low population density; larvae may be difficult to find in the field; and the period over which pollen is shed is relatively short. Such difficulties were discussed by Aviron et al. (2009), who calculated that to detect a change in abundance of 20 % with adequate statistical power would require more than 100 pairs of fields or field margins. Furthermore, there are restrictions due to limited resources and time limitations for largescale agro-ecological experiments (Perry et al., 2003). Additional problems include refusals to grant permission for trials in many EU member states and the risk of damage by activist...|$|E
40|$|Broadcasting is {{the final}} output of the ‘production’ of {{broadcast}} signal and its ‘transmission’ to the public. The broadcast’s underlying content could not be received and perceived by the member of public unless it is converted to a signal or a program-carrying signal which is then transmitted. Thus, broadcast signal is not a natural occurrence. Broadcasting organizations are owners of their broadcast signals aside from the ownership in the underlying content. In this relation {{it does not matter}} whether the underlying content is an authorial work in copyright or it is a work, which currently falls in the public domain or even a non-protected content in intellectual property law. The use of ‘property’ as a regulatory mechanism to protect ‘broadcast signal’ (as an intangible good) has been accepted in both international and national intellectual property law. Its use conforms to both the character of ‘tradability’ and ‘excludability’ of other, more traditional properties. Several theories exist to justify granting new property-type rights (in the form of the intellectual property-type rights or copyright-like property protection) to broadcast signals. Although few differences may still remain, these justifications are similar to those that exist for protection of authorial works, performances and phonograms. Accordingly, underlying content and broadcast signal are two different subject matters in international copyright and related rights regime and their severability has been proved. Granting new property-type rights to broadcasting organizations with regard to their broadcasts is compatible with the existing technical, structural and functional characteristics and realities of the industry. It should afford broadcasters the ability to control the unauthorized exploitation and unconsented-to dissemination of their broadcast signal over any medium. For, the broadcast signal does not exist only during actual broadcast, it might also be used after the fixation of the broadcast and be placed on online services by the broadcaster itself or by any other unauthorized parties for commercial purposes. Therefore, it is recommended that in a new international norm setting, possibly through adoption of a new WIPO broadcasting treaty, in contrary to the Rome Convention that is a technology-specific instrument, follow a technologically neutral approach in the both platform of origin and platform of exploitation of broadcast signal. In granting new rights and protection, the new treaty should provide that its principal protective mechanism be a ‘mandatory’ ‘exclusionary property protection mechanism’, in other words, granting an exclusive right of authorizing or prohibiting the exploitation of broadcast signal. This mechanism, has already been laid down by the Rome Convention, followed by WPPT (for protection of performers and producers of phonograms) and the WIPO Beijing Treaty and has recently been experimented by numerous national legislations, even in countries that are not party to the Rome Convention, but that have updated the rights and protections conferred to broadcasting organizations. However, in relation to the controversial issues in the negotiation in the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights (SCCR) including some or all post-fixation rights and the protection of the pre-broadcast signal, technological protection measures and rights management information there are other possible solutions. These solutions or proposals necessarily are not conforming to an individual national law. In this regard, the new WIPO broadcasting treaty can give sufficient freedom with greater flexibilities to its contracting parties which permit different level of discretion, and to decide whether they will grant new proposed rights and protections to broadcasters in their legislation as a mandatory or non-mandatory mechanism. However, the principle of reciprocity may be applied regarding these categories of rights and protections. Since there have been concerns raised about possible consequences of an ‘expansive exclusionary protection mechanisms’ on the public interest, the new treaty may allow for its contracting parties to provide for the same kind of limitations or exceptions with regard to the protection of broadcast signal as they provide for, in their national legislation, in connection with the protection of copyright in literary and artistic works. Founding a new treaty on the ‘exclusionary property-protection mechanism’ or on ‘extended property rights’ over broadcast signal would not prejudice the autonomy of authors and other right holders in the broadcast underlying content. For, they would still be able to disseminate the content itself as they wish, but not derived from the broadcast signal without being first consented to by the broadcasting organization. Finally, acquiring greater property rights for a broadcast signal would not lead to control, either directly or indirectly, over the content itself by broadcasting organizations. The new treaty may include non-prejudice and <b>safeguard</b> <b>clauses</b> to protect copyright and other right holders. In addition, with regard to the broadcast of authorial works and other protected contents, the exercise of the broadcasters’ rights is subject to the rights they acquired from the authors or other right holders...|$|E
