5|$|Education about {{oral hygiene}} for {{long-term}} methamphetamine users is sometimes required. Changes in diet are often necessary for recovering drug users that are receiving dental treatment, {{and the use}} of <b>sugar-free</b> gum may be beneficial. The consumption of water and the avoidance of beverages with a diuretic (dehydrating) effect can also help patients with meth mouth.|$|E
5|$|There are {{theoretically}} {{no restrictions}} {{on where the}} ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, {{it can be difficult}} to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory so calculating the proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrate is difficult. In some countries, it may be hard to find <b>sugar-free</b> forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.|$|E

25|$|Other studies {{indicated}} that the caries preventive effect of chewing <b>sugar-free</b> gum {{is related to the}} chewing process itself rather than being an effect of gum sweeteners or additives, such as polyols and carbamide. A study investigated the in situ effect of casein phosphopeptide–amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP–ACP) found that its incorporation into a <b>sugar-free</b> gum increases the remineralization / protection of eroded enamel surface significantly.|$|E

25|$|Sorbitol is {{referred}} to as a nutritive sweetener because it provides dietary energy: 2.6 kilocalories (11 kilojoules) per gram versus the average 4 kilocalories (17 kilojoules) for carbohydrates.

25|$|Actiq is {{produced}} by the pharmaceutical company Cephalon on a plastic stick; this provides {{the means by which}} the drug can maintain its placement while it dissolves slowly in the mouth for absorption across the buccal mucosa, {{in a manner similar to}} sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone film strips. An Actiq lozenge contains two grams of sugar (eight calories). Actiq has been linked to dental decay, with some users who had no prior dental issues suffering tooth loss, and in the U.S many users have started their own Facebook pages to educate users about the severe dental issues caused by the so-called fentanyl lollipops. CBS News reported the issue 28 September 2009. The status of a <b>sugar-free</b> version, called Actiq-SF, is unclear. Since the release of Fentora—an effervescent buccal fentanyl tablet for breakthrough cancer pain—Cephalon has indefinitely postponed plans to release a <b>sugar-free</b> version of Actiq.|$|E

Smith continued to teach aerobics before and after work, conducting up to 13 classes per week, with up to 50 or 60 students per class. She also worked a third job, baking <b>sugar-free</b> cakes and vegetable frittatas for local cafes.|$|E
25|$|The {{anthocyanins}}, anthocyanidins {{with sugar}} group(s), are mostly 3-glucosides of the anthocyanidins. The anthocyanins are subdivided into the <b>sugar-free</b> anthocyanidin aglycones and the anthocyanin glycosides. As of 2003, more than 400 anthocyanins had been reported, while later literature in early 2006, puts the number {{at more than}} 550 different anthocyanins. The difference in chemical structure that occurs in response to changes in pH, {{is the reason why}} anthocyanins often are used as pH indicators, as they change from red in acids to blue in bases.|$|E
25|$|Gum chewing is {{regarded}} as a helpful way to cure halitosis (bad breath). Chewing gum not only helps to add freshness to breath but can aid in removing food particles and bacteria associated with bad breath from teeth. It does this by stimulating saliva, which essentially washes out the mouth. Chewing <b>sugar-free</b> gum for 20 minutes after a meal helps prevent tooth decay, according to the American Dental Association, because the act of chewing the <b>sugar-free</b> gum produces saliva to wash away bacteria, which protects teeth. Chewing gum after a meal replaces brushing and flossing, if that's not possible, to prevent tooth decay and increase saliva production. Chewing gum can also help with the lack of saliva or xerostomia since it naturally stimulates saliva production. Saliva is made of chemicals, such as organic molecules, inorganic ions and macromolecules. 0.5% of saliva deals with dental health, since tooth enamel is made of calcium phosphate, those inorganic ions in saliva help repair the teeth and keep them in good condition. The pH of saliva is neutral, which having a pH of 7 allows it to remineralize tooth enamel. Falling below a pH of 5.5 (which is acidic) causes the saliva to demineralize the teeth.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the trade}} names Equal, NutraSweet, and Canderel, {{aspartame}} is an ingredient in approximately 6,000 consumer foods and beverages sold worldwide, including (but not limited to) diet sodas and other soft drinks, instant breakfasts, breath mints, cereals, <b>sugar-free</b> chewing gum, cocoa mixes, frozen desserts, gelatin desserts, juices, laxatives, chewable vitamin supplements, milk drinks, pharmaceutical drugs and supplements, shake mixes, tabletop sweeteners, teas, instant coffees, topping mixes, wine coolers and yogurt. It is provided as a table condiment in some countries. Aspartame is less suitable for baking than other sweeteners, because it breaks down when heated and loses {{much of its}} sweetness.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the aforementioned treatments, there are also many management approaches that can alleviate the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include using non-metallic silverware, avoiding metallic or bitter tasting foods, increasing the consumption of foods high in protein, flavoring foods with spices and seasonings, serving foods cold {{in order to reduce}} any unpleasant taste or odor, frequently brushing one's teeth and utilizing mouthwash, or using sialogogues such as chewing <b>sugar-free</b> gum or sour-tasting drops that stimulate the productivity of saliva. When taste is impeded, the food experience can be improved through means other than taste, such as texture, aroma, temperature, and color.|$|E
25|$|On December 13, 2010, President Obama {{signed the}} Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010 (effective in 2014) that {{mandates}} schools that receive federal funding to offer healthy snacks and beverages to students. The act bans {{the selling of}} soft drinks to students and requires schools to provide healthier options such as water, unflavored low-fat milk, 100% fruit and vegetable drinks or <b>sugar-free</b> carbonated beverages. The portion sizes available to students {{will be based on}} age: eight ounces for elementary schools, twelve ounces for middle and high schools. Proponents of the act predict the new mandate it {{will make it easier for}} students to make healthy beverage choices while at school.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sugar-free</b> gum {{sweetened}} with xylitol {{has been}} shown to reduce cavities and plaque. The sweetener sorbitol has the same benefit, but is only about one-third as effective as xylitol. Other sugar substitutes, such as maltitol, aspartame and acesulfame K, have also been found to not cause tooth decay. Xylitol is specific in its inhibition of Streptococcus mutans, bacteria that are significant contributors to tooth decay. Xylitol inhibits Streptococcus mutans in the presence of other sugars, with the exception of fructose. Xylitol is a safe sweetener that benefits teeth and saliva production because, unlike most sugars, it is not fermented to acid. Daily doses of xylitol below 3.44grams are ineffective and doses above 10.32grams show no additional benefit. Other active ingredients in chewing gum include fluoride, which strengthens tooth enamel, and p-chlorbenzyl-4-methylbenzylpiperazine, which prevents travel sickness. Chewing gum also increases saliva production.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of {{infectious}} diarrhea is by improved sanitation, clean drinking water, and hand washing with soap. Breastfeeding {{for at least}} six months is also recommended as is vaccination against rotavirus. Oral rehydration solution (ORS), which is clean water with modest amounts of salts and sugar, is the treatment of choice. Zinc tablets are also recommended. These treatments have been estimated to have saved 50 million children in the past 25 years. When people have diarrhea it is recommended that they continue to eat healthy food and babies continue to be breastfed. If commercial ORS are not available, homemade solutions may be used. In those with severe dehydration, intravenous fluids may be required. Most cases; however, can be managed well with fluids by mouth. Osmotic diarrhea can also be the result of maldigestion (e.g., pancreatic disease or Coeliac disease), in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water. Or it can be caused by osmotic laxatives (which work to alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much magnesium or vitamin C or undigested lactose can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who has lactose intolerance can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products. In persons who have fructose malabsorption, excess fructose intake can also cause diarrhea. High-fructose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorbable and less likely to cause diarrhea. Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol (often found in <b>sugar-free</b> foods) are difficult for the body to absorb and, in large amounts, may lead to osmotic diarrhea. In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when the offending agent (e.g. milk, sorbitol) is stopped.|$|E

500|$|Conklin's fasting {{therapy was}} adopted by neurologists in {{mainstream}} practice. In 1916, a Dr McMurray wrote to the New York Medical Journal claiming to have successfully treated epilepsy patients with a fast, followed by a starch- and <b>sugar-free</b> diet, since 1912. In 1921, prominent endocrinologist H. Rawle Geyelin reported his experiences to the American Medical Association convention. He had seen Conklin's success first-hand and had attempted to reproduce the results in 36 of his own patients. He achieved similar results despite only having studied the patients for a short time. Further studies in the 1920s indicated that seizures generally returned after the fast. Charles Howland, the parent of one of Conklin's successful patients and a wealthy New York corporate lawyer, gave his brother John a gift of $5,000 to study [...] "the ketosis of starvation".
