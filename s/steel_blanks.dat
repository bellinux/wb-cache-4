After World War I, cannonball manufacturing technology was adapted to allow the manufacture of hollow, all-metal boules.

40|$|Due to {{the demands}} to {{reducing}} the gas emissions, energy saving and producing safer vehicles have driven the development of {{ultra high strength steel}}. Since the mechanical properties of ultra high strength steel are remarkably high, it has become a major setback for forming process and this has led lead to the development of special forming technique for ultra high strength steel called Hot Stamping. In hot stamping, the ultra high strength <b>steel</b> <b>blank</b> is heated to its austenization temperature of about 900 - 950 ◦C inside the furnace. Then, the heated blank is transferred to the tool where forming takes place and simultaneously quench the blank inside the tool. As the tool dwells, the microstructure of the blank becomes fully martensite thus giving the final part strength of up to 1500 MPa. In order to {{have a better understanding of}} the Hot Stamping Process, a numerical model of heat transfer need to be developed to simulate the temperature changes of the blank as well as validate the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of the blank and tool contact surface as a function of distance and time. The numerical model is based on the heat transfer at the contact surface between the ultra high strength <b>steel</b> <b>blank</b> (Boron Manganese <b>Steel)</b> and the tool made of Tool Steel (SKD 11) ...|$|R

In other words, knowledge of the hardness distribution within a hot-formed component is enough to set up the newly developed computational model. The hardness distribution can be easily introduced via an experimentally measured hardness curve or via hardness mapping from a corresponding hot-forming simulation.

Three sets of boron <b>steel</b> <b>blanks</b> are heat treated such that their as-treated microstructures {{are close to}} fully martensitic, bainitic and ferritic/pearlitic, respectively. Hardness measurements show that the resulting blanks cover the full scope of possible hardness values, from 165 HV in the ferritic/pearlitic range to 477 HV in the fully hardened state. These three main grades provide the input data for a {{constitutive model}} consisting of an extended Swift hardening law and a stress triaxiality and Lode angle dependent fracture criterion. The hardening behavior of each grade is determined using standard tensile tests at quasi-static strain rates. The strain-based fracture criterion is calibrated using four different flat fracture samples.

40|$|In {{hot forming}} die quenching, {{furnaces}} {{are used to}} austenitize ultra high strength <b>steel</b> <b>blanks.</b> In the case of coated steels, like Usibor® 1500 P, furnace heating also transforms a protective Al-Si layer into a permanent Al-Si-Fe intermetallic coating. Modeling this process requires knowledge of the thermophysical properties of the material, specifically, radiative properties and how the sensible energy and latent heat of austenitization change with blank temperature. While the sensible energy is known, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the radiative properties and the latent heat of austenitization. In this work the effective specific heat of Usibor® 1500 P is inferred through inverse analysis of temperature data collected on coupons heated in a muffle furnace. This technique is first used to validate the heat transfer model, and then used to reveal the distribution of latent heat of austenitization at higher temperatures. The characterization of the radiative properties is carried out on Gleeble-heated coupons using a near-infrared spectrometer and a Fourier transform infrared reflectometer. Obtained thermophysical properties are employed in developing a heat transfer model for the patched blanks to gain insight into the non-uniform heating of patched blanks. The thermocouple measurements carried out in muffle and roller hearth furnaces are used to validate the modeled temperatures. Various strategies to optimize the heating process for patched blanks are proposed and evaluated, {{including the use of}} a high emissivity coating to compensate for the increased thermal mass of the patch...|$|E
40|$|Laser-based {{ultrasonic}} (LBU) measurement shows {{great promise}} for on-line monitoring of weld quality in tailor-welded blanks. Tailor-welded blanks are <b>steel</b> <b>blanks</b> made from plates of differing thickness and/or properties butt-welded together; {{they are used}} in automobile manufacturing to produce body, frame, and closure panels. LBU uses a pulsed laser to generate the ultrasound and a continuous wave (CW) laser interferometer to detect the ultrasound {{at the point of}} interrogation to perform ultrasonic inspection. LBU enables in-process measurements since there is no sensor contact or near-contact with the workpiece. The authors are using laser-generated plate (Lamb) waves to propagate from one plate into the weld nugget as a means of detecting defects. A persistent problem in the analysis of Lamb wave signatures in experimental data is the fact that several different modes appear simultaneously in the signal. The modes overlap in both frequency and time domains. Attempts to separate the overlapping Lamb wave signatures by conventional signal processing methods have been unsatisfactory. This paper reports an exciting alternative to conventional methods. Severely overlapping Lamb waves are found to be readily separable by Bayesian parameter estimation. The authors have used a linear-chirped Gaussian-windowed sinusoid as a model of the Lamb wave mode. For signatures captured in laser ultrasonic data in tailor-welded blanks, this has led to straightforward separation of multiple modes. Furthermore, the resulting parameter sets for the different modes reveal crucial characterizing features of the properties of the workpiece...|$|E
