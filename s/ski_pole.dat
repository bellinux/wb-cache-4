The rules FIS rules governing ski boots and bindings are not enforced for this class, with different requirements than rules that apply to that equipment for able-bodied competitors.

25|$|Skiers in {{this class}} use two skis and no ski poles in para-Alpine and para-Nordic. While skiers are {{prohibited}} from using traditional ski poles, they may use mini poles {{so long as they}} are unable to hold a traditional <b>ski</b> <b>pole</b> without the use of a prostheses. Skiers are also allowed to use prostheses or orthoses in competition. FIS rules for ski boots and binding heights are followed for this class. Skiers {{in this class}} must wear a Slalom helmet in Slalom events and crash helmets during the Giant Slalom.|$|E
25|$|Skiers in {{this class}} use two skis and no ski poles in para-Alpine and para-Nordic, though skiers can use mini-ski poles {{provided}} they cannot hold a <b>ski</b> <b>pole</b> {{without the use of}} a prosthesis. Skiers develop techniques to ski that compensate for balance issues as a result of missing arms. A factoring system is used in para-Alpine and para-Nordic to allow LW5/7 skiers to compete fairly against other skiers with disabilities. While this classification was not grouped with others at the 1984 Winter Olympics Exhibition Competition, it was grouped with other standing classes during events in the 1990s and 2000s.|$|E
25|$|For {{international}} para-Alpine skiing competitions, classification is {{done through}} IPC Alpine Skiing. A national federation such as Alpine Canada handles classification for domestic competitions. For para-Nordic skiing events, classification is handled by IPC Nordic Skiing Technical Committee {{on the international}} level and by the national sports federation such as Cross-Country Canada on a country by country level. When being assessed into this classification, {{a number of things}} are considered, including reviewing the skiers medical history and medical information on the skier's disability, having a physical examination and an in person assessment of the skier training or competing. If a skier in this classification has the ability to use a <b>ski</b> <b>pole</b> of some sort, they may do so but they need to changes classes and compete in LW6/8.|$|E

LW1 skiers use two poles but may ski {{on one or two}} skis. LW2 skiers use one ski and two poles. LW3, LW4 skiers use two skis and two poles. LW5 and LW7 skiers do not use poles.

2500|$|Para-Alpine skiers in this {{classification}} [...] {{have their}} choice regarding how many skis and ski poles {{they wish to}} user, along {{with the type of}} ski poles they wish to utilize. In para-Nordic skiing, skiers use two skis and have an option to use one or two ski poles. Outriggers are one type of <b>ski</b> <b>pole</b> LW9 skiers can use, which requires its own techniques to use. As there are a broad range of disabilities in this class, different skiing techniques are learned by competitors. Skiers missing an arm use a technique that corrects lateral balance issues resulting from the missing arm. Skiers with cerebral palsy have the introduction of ski poles delayed as skiers may overgrip them.|$|E
