5000|$|Documents {{obtained}} through the Freedom of Information Act revealed that CRS implemented a condom-promoting program called <b>Shuga.</b> CRS {{responded to this}} allegation as well by confirming that [...] "The SAIDIA FY2011 annual report to CDC correctly notes that the video was used {{as part of the}} abstinence and be faithful (AB) activities in FY2011, but stopped at the end of quarter three when CRS learned the materials were being used and were not appropriate for use within our programming." [...] However, CRS's claims to have protested against the use of <b>Shuga</b> are again contradicted by documents bearing CRS's letterhead which were {{obtained through}} the Freedom of Information Act. According to these FOIA documents, CRS ended the <b>Shuga</b> program, not because it was morally objectionable, but because it was no longer implementing non-evidence based behavioral interventions. <b>Shuga</b> was discontinued along with at least seven other programs. In fact, in April 2012, CRS submitted to PEPFAR its continuation grant application for year five of the SAIDIA project. On page 342 of the FOIA documents is a very clear statement from CRS about how it is considering both <b>Shuga</b> I and II for year five of the SAIDIA project. CRS said in its grant application to PEPFAR, “SAIDIA is considering <b>Shuga</b> I and II to help address the gap particularly in ages 17-19 years. <b>Shuga</b> I and II addresses issues of multiple concurrent partnership, peer pressure, alcohol and substance use and status knowledge among youth.” Not only does this contradict CRS’s claim that they “informed CDC that SAIDIA would not use this video within our abstinence and fidelity work,” but it calls into question its last line about continually reviewing and adjusting programs to ensure that they are in line with Catholic teaching.|$|E
