500|$|Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill is {{an upscale}} English pub {{environment}} featuring casual dining and sporting events aired on satellite equipment. The 290 cover restaurant opened in December 2012 {{next to the}} Colosseum, replacing a restaurant by chef Bradley Ogden. Ramsay said {{of the decision to}} launch the pub and grill and his BurGR restaurant at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino: [...] "The two things missing on the strip were a great burger restaurant and an authentic pub & grill, so we're very excited to offer these two very different, but equally vibrant new restaurants in Vegas for guests to enjoy". There are approximately 100 different beers served and the cuisine is designed to pair well with beer. Classic pub-style dishes favored by Ramsay include fish and chips, bangers and mash, English ale onion soup, shepherd's pie, as well as grilled offerings including aged beef rib eye, brick pressed Cornish chicken, lamb T-bone, and Scottish salmon. The featured desert is <b>spotted</b> <b>dog.</b>|$|E

60|$|An hour of {{hard work}} {{produced}} an agreeable change in the abode of the native, for the table was cleared, room swept and dusted, fire brightened, and {{the holes in the}} sofa-covering were pinned up till time could be found to mend them. To be sure, rolls of lint lay in corners, smears of ashes were on the stove hearth, and dust still lurked on chair rounds and table legs. But too much must not be expected of a new convert, so the young missionary sat down to rest, well pleased and ready for another attempt as soon as she could decide in what direction it should be made. She quailed before Boo as she looked at the unconscious innocent peacefully playing with the <b>spotted</b> <b>dog,</b> now bereft of his tail, and the lone sausage with which he was attempting to feed the hungry animal, whose red mouth always gaped for more.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly {{her uncle}} rode {{in with her}} to Portsmouth on a {{shopping}} expedition, and as {{the streets of the}} seaport were scarcely safe for a young woman without an escort, he carried a little book in his pocket wherewith he beguiled the time that she spent in the selection of his frying-pans, fire-irons, and the like, and her own gloves and kerchiefs. They dined at the 'ordinary' at the inn, and there Dr. Woodford met his great friends Mr. Stanbury of Botley, and Mr. Worsley of Gatcombe, in the Isle of Wight, who both, like him, were opposed to the reading of the Declaration of Indulgence, as unconstitutional, and deeply anxious as to the fate of the greatly beloved Bishop of Bath and Wells. It was inevitable that they should fall into deep and earnest council together, and when dinner was over they agreed to adjourn to the house of a friend learned in ecclesiastical law to hunt up the rights of the case, leaving Anne to await them in a private room at the <b>Spotted</b> <b>Dog,</b> shown to her by the landlady.|$|E

60|$|The Editor's Tales was {{a volume}} republished from the St. Paul's Magazine, and professed {{to give an}} editor's {{experience}} of his dealings with contributors. I {{do not think that}} there is a single incident in the book which could bring back to any one concerned the memory of a past event. And yet there is not an incident in it the outline of which was not presented to my mind by the remembrance of some fact:--how an ingenious gentleman got into conversation with me, I not knowing that he knew me to be an editor, and pressed his little article on my notice; how I was addressed by a lady with a becoming pseudonym and with much equally becoming audacity; how I was appealed to by the dearest of little women whom here I have called Mary Gresley; how in my own early days there was a struggle over an abortive periodical which was intended to be the best thing ever done; how terrible was the tragedy of a poor drunkard, who with infinite learning at his command made one sad final effort to reclaim himself, and perished while he was making it; and lastly how a poor weak editor was driven nearly to madness by threatened litigation from a rejected contributor. Of these stories, The <b>Spotted</b> <b>Dog,</b> with the struggles of the drunkard scholar, is the best. I know now, however, that when the things were good they came out too quick one upon another to gain much attention;--and so also, luckily, when they were bad.|$|E
60|$|Yet I am not certain; {{and perhaps}} {{the best of all}} news is that nothing is really new. I {{sometimes}} have a fancy that many of these new things in new countries are but the resurrections of old things which have been wickedly killed or stupidly stunted in old countries. I have looked over the sea of little tables in some light and airy open-air café; and my thoughts have gone back to the plain wooden bench and wooden table that stands solitary and weather-stained outside so many neglected English inns. We talk of experimenting in the French café, as of some fresh and almost impudent innovation. But our fathers had the French café, {{in the sense of the}} free-and-easy table in the sun and air. The only difference was that French democracy was allowed to develop its café, or multiply its tables, while English plutocracy prevented any such popular growth. Perhaps there are other examples of old types and patterns, lost in the old oligarchy and saved in the new democracies. I am haunted with a hint that the new structures are not so very new; and that they remind me of something very old. As I look from the balcony floor the crowds seem to float away and the colours to soften and grow pale, and I know I am in one of the simplest and most ancestral of human habitations. I am looking down from the old wooden gallery upon the courtyard of an inn. This new architectural model, which I have described, is after all one of the oldest European models, now neglected in Europe and especially in England. It was the theatre in which were enacted innumerable picaresque comedies and romantic plays, with figures ranging from Sancho Panza to Sam Weller. It served as the apparatus, like some gigantic toy set up in bricks and timber, for the ancient and perhaps eternal game of tennis. The very terms of the original game were taken from the inn courtyard, and the players scored accordingly as they hit the buttery-hatch or the roof. Singular speculations hover in my mind as the scene darkens and the quadrangle below begins to empty in the last hours of night. Some day perhaps this huge structure will be found standing in a solitude like a skeleton; and it will be the skeleton of the <b>Spotted</b> <b>Dog</b> or the Blue Boar. It will wither and decay until it is worthy at last to be a tavern. I do not know whether men will play tennis on its ground floor, with various scores and prizes for hitting the electric fan, or the lift, or the head waiter. Perhaps the very words will only remain as part of some such rustic game. Perhaps the electric fan will no longer be electric and the elevator will no longer elevate, and the waiter will only wait to be hit. But at least it is only by the decay of modern plutocracy, which seems already to have begun, that the secret of the structure even of this plutocratic palace can stand revealed. And after long years, when its lights are extinguished and only the long shadows inhabit its halls and vestibules, there may come a new noise like thunder; of D'Artagnan knocking at the door.|$|E

A painting from the mid-19th century features a lady (believed to be Queen Victoria) in a carriage drawn by a spotted horse, followed by a <b>spotted</b> Dalmatian <b>dog.</b> <b>Spotted</b> ponies were popular for their colouration, and were sold for large sums of money.|$|R
40|$|The white {{spotting}} locus (S) in dogs is colocalized {{with the}} MITF (microphtalmia-associated transcription factor) gene. The phenotypic {{effects of the}} four S alleles range from solid colour (S) to extreme white spotting (s(w)). We have investigated four candidate mutations associated with the s(w) allele, a SINE insertion, a SNP at a conserved site and a simple repeat polymorphism all associated with the MITF-M promoter {{as well as a}} 12 base pair deletion in exon 1 B. The variants associated with white spotting at all four loci were also found among wolves and we conclude that none of these could be a sole causal mutation, at least not for extreme white spotting. We propose that the three canine white spotting alleles are not caused by three independent mutations but represent haplotype effects due to different combinations of causal polymorphisms. The simple repeat polymorphism showed extensive diversity both in dogs and wolves, and allele-sharing was common between wolves and white <b>spotted</b> <b>dogs</b> but was non-existent between solid and <b>spotted</b> <b>dogs</b> as well as between wolves and solid dogs. This finding was unexpected as Solid is assumed to be the wild-type allele. The data indicate that the simple repeat polymorphism has been a target for selection during dog domestication and breed formation. We also evaluated the significance of the three MITF-M associated polymorphisms with a Luciferase assay, and found conclusive evidence that the simple repeat polymorphism affects promoter activity. Three alleles associated with white spotting gave consistently lower promoter activity compared with the allele associated with solid colour. We propose that the simple repeat polymorphism affects cooperativity between transcription factors binding on either flanking sides of the repeat. Thus, both genetic and functional evidence show that the simple repeat polymorphism is a key regulator of white <b>spotting</b> in <b>dogs...</b>|$|R
