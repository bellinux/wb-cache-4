40|$|Many planets orbit {{within an}} AU of their stars, raising {{questions}} about their origins. Particularly puzzling are the planets found near the silicate <b>sublimation</b> <b>front.</b> We investigate conditions near the front in the protostellar disk around a young intermediate-mass star, using the first global 3 -D radiation non-ideal MHD simulations in this context. We treat the starlight heating; the silicate grains sublimation and deposition at the local, time-varying temperature and density; temperature-dependent Ohmic dissipation; and various initial magnetic fields. The results show magnetorotational turbulence around the <b>sublimation</b> <b>front</b> at 0. 5 AU. The disk interior to 0. 8 AU is turbulent, with velocities exceeding 10 % of the sound speed. Beyond 0. 8 AU is the dead zone, cooler than 1000 K and with turbulence orders of magnitude weaker. A local pressure maximum just inside the dead zone concentrates solid particles, favoring their growth. Over many orbits, a vortex develops at the dead zones inner edge, increasing the disks thickness locally by around 10 %. We synthetically observe the results using Monte Carlo transfer calculations, finding the <b>sublimation</b> <b>front</b> is near-infrared bright. The models with net vertical magnetic fields develop extended, magnetically-supported atmospheres that reprocess extra starlight, raising the near-infrared flux 20 %. The vortex throws a nonaxisymmetric shadow on the outer disk. At wavelengths > 2 micron, the flux varies several percent on monthly timescales. The variations are more regular when the vortex is present. The vortex is directly visible as an arc at ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths, given sub-AU spatial resolution.

40|$|The broad {{objective}} of the presented research {{is to develop a}} more analytical basis for formulation and process development of freeze-drying in order to minimize trial and error experimentation. First, the feasibility of using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to observe the time course of the shape and position of the <b>sublimation</b> <b>front</b> moving profile during primary freeze-drying were investigated. It was found that the ice <b>sublimation</b> <b>front</b> can be observed with the help of 0. 1 mM hydrobromic acid (HBr) as a dopant and using a single point ramped imaging with T 1 enhancement (SPRITE) sequence. The shape of the <b>sublimation</b> <b>front</b> estimated through the temperature profile study by thermocouples agreed with the MRI observations. The <b>sublimation</b> <b>front</b> obtained experimentally is much more curved than those predicted by published models of heat and mass transfer in freeze-drying. These models appear to underestimate lateral heat transfer in vials. It was also found that residual moisture distribution in a freeze-dried HSA with as high as 11 % moisture cannot be measured in this study. A high field NMR instrument and a stronger gradient may decrease the detection limit. Second, composition and temperature dependences of glycine crystallization rate during annealing from a glycine/sucrose excipient systems were examined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as well as differential scanning calorimetric (DSC). It was found that half crystallization time were similar as measured by NMR and DSC. However, the NMR method is significantly more sensitive. A linear relationship was observed between the logarithm of the half crystallization time and the logarithm of the molar ratio of glycine and the temperature dependence of the crystallization rate followed an Arrhenius relationship. Third, both polymers and disaccharide systems were examined by NMR and DSC in order to further understand the physical significance of the molecular mobility change temperature in amorphous systems. Results from this study suggest: (1) the appearance of a second Lorenzian decay is not a reliable indication for molecular mobility change temperature for freeze-dried samples at pharmaceutically relevant residual moisture levels; (2) Tg as measured by DSC is a good indicator of the molecular mobility change temperature in small molecules; (3) NMR is more sensitive to the molecular mobility change within the polymer systems than DSC. ...|$|E

30|$|Why is it {{that the}} D/H ratio of the {{sublimate}} gas decreases with time? This effect is not seen in solid samples. Depending on the rate of solid state diffusion within the sample and the rate of removal of material from the head space, solid samples may sublimate un-fractionated, i.e. at the bulk ratio of the solid as monolayer after monolayer are stripped away. Or, instead, even solid samples may exhibit a Rayleigh-like fractionation in which the head space gas becomes more isotopically heavy with time e.g. [19] if diffusion allows molecules to travel away from the actively sublimating surface faster than the <b>sublimation</b> <b>front</b> proceeds.|$|E
40|$|Many stars host planets {{orbiting}} {{within a}} few astronomical units (AU). The occurrence rate and distributions of masses and orbits vary greatly with the host stars mass. These close planets origins are a mystery that motivates investigating protoplanetary disks central regions. A key factor governing the conditions near the star is the silicate <b>sublimation</b> <b>front,</b> which largely determines where the starlight is absorbed, and which is often called the inner rim. We present the first radiation hydrodynamical modeling of the <b>sublimation</b> <b>front</b> in the disks around the young intermediate-mass stars called Herbig Ae stars. The models are axisymmetric, and include starlight heating, silicate grains sublimating and condensing to equilibrium at the local, time-dependent temperature and density, and accretion stresses parametrizing the results of MHD magneto-rotational turbulence models. The results compare well with radiation hydrostatic solutions, and prove to be dynamically stable. Passing the model disks into Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we show that the models satisfy observational constraints on the inner rims location. A small optically-thin halo of hot dust naturally arises between the inner rim and the star. The inner rim has a substantial radial extent, corresponding to several disk scale heights. While the fronts overall position varies with the stellar luminosity, its radial extent depends on the mass accretion rate. A pressure maximum develops near the location of thermal ionization at temperatures about 1000 K. The pressure maximum is capable of halting solid pebbles radial drift and concentrating them in a zone where temperatures are sufficiently high for annealing to form crystalline silicates.

Over time, the D/H ratio of the gas emitted from {{the top of the}} dust lag will increase until only the fractionation from the dust is present. The advancing <b>sublimation</b> <b>front</b> within the solid ice provides new material to the system at the bulk ratio. Thus the maximum fractionation is the dust lag fractionation multiplied by the bulk ratio.

The morphological changes observed on the surface are visible in the form of roundish features, which are growing in size from a given location in a preferential direction, at a rate of 20 – 29 cm h^− 1 during the observational period. The location where changes started and the contours of the expanding features are bluer than the surroundings, suggesting the presence of ices (H^_ 2 O and/or CO^_ 2) exposed on the surface.

40|$|We present {{radiation}} hydrodynamics {{simulations of}} the collapse of massive pre-stellar cores. We treat frequency dependent radiative feedback from stellar evolution and accretion luminosity at a numerical resolution down to 1. 27 AU. In the 2 D approximation of axially symmetric simulations, it is possible {{for the first time to}} simulate the whole accretion phase (up to the end of the accretion disk epoch) for the forming massive star and to perform a broad scan of the parameter space. Our simulation series show evidently the necessity to incorporate the dust <b>sublimation</b> <b>front</b> to preserve the high shielding property of massive accretion disks. While confirming the upper mass limit of spherically symmetric accretion, our disk accretion models show a persistent high anisotropy of the corresponding thermal radiation field. This yields to the growth of the highest-mass stars ever formed in multi-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations, far beyond the upper mass limit of spherical accretion. Non-axially symmetric effects are not necessary to sustain accretion. The radiation pressure launches a stable bipolar outflow, which grows in angle with time as presumed from observations.

40|$|Abstract. The {{subject of}} this paper is the attempt to {{reproduce}} the CO observed production rate curve of comet Hale-Bopp with a numerical model of the nucleus thermal evolution and chemical differentiation. Three possible mechanisms can contribute to the total measured CO production: 1) sublimation of CO from the nucleus; 2) release of gas of CO trapped in the amorphous water ice in the nucleus; 3) emission of CO from grains in the inner coma (diffuse source). To match production rate observations with a numerical model we need an interplay between these emission mechanisms: success (and failure) in reproducing observed curve gives us useful information about the relative importance of these mechanisms and the depth of <b>sublimation</b> <b>front.</b> Using a numerical model of the nucleus we were able to match the observed CO production curve using quite standard initial parameters. We verified {{that it is impossible to}} reproduce the observed CO production curve taking solely into account sublimation of CO from ice contained in the nucleus or the release of gas of CO trapped in the amorphous water ice: if amorphous ice is not present immediately below the surface, we have to invoke some other physical process resulting in a perihelion CO production peak, such as a distributed source in the coma and/or the release of some of the trapped CO during water ice sublimation...|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{have shown}} that the often cited radiation pressure barrier to accretion onto massive stars can be circumvented, when the radiation field is highly anisotropic {{in the presence of a}} circumstellar accretion disk with high optical depth. Here, these studies of the so-called flashlight effect are expanded by including the opacity of the innermost dust-free but potentially optically thick gas regions around forming massive stars. In addition to frequency-dependent opacities for the dust grains, we use temperature- and density-dependent Planck- and Rosseland mean opacities for the gas. The simulations show that the innermost dust-free parts of the accretion disks are optically thick to the stellar radiation over a substantial fraction of the solid angle above and below the disk’s midplane. The temperature in the shielded disk region decreases faster with radius than in a comparison simulation with a lower constant gas opacity, and the dust <b>sublimation</b> <b>front</b> is shifted to smaller radii. The shielding by the dust-free gas in the inner disk thus contributes to an enhanced flashlight effect, which ultimately results in a smaller opening angle of the radiation pressure driven outflow and in a much longer timescale of sustained feeding of the circumstellar disk by the molecular cloud core. We conclude that it is necessary to properly account for the opacity of the inner dust-free disk regions around forming massive stars in order to correctly assess the effectiveness of the flashlight effect, the opening angle of radiation pressure driven outflows, and the lifetime and morphological evolution of the accretion disk...|$|E
40|$|The first {{challenge}} {{in the formation of}} both terrestrial planets and the cores of gas giants is the retention of grains in protoplanetary disks. In most regions of these disks, gas attains sub-Keplerian speeds as a consequence of a negative pressure gradient. Hydrodynamic drag leads to orbital decay and depletion of the solid material in the disk, with characteristic timescales as short as only a few hundred years for meter-sized objects at 1 AU. In this paper, we suggest a particle retention mechanism which promotes the accumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the water <b>sublimation</b> <b>front</b> or ``snow line. '' This model {{is based on the assumption}} that, in the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution of the disk is due to turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in the surface layers of the disk. The depth to which MRI effectively generates turbulence is a strong function of the grain size and abundance. A sharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reduces the column depth of the active layer. As the disk evolves towards a quasi-steady-state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum in radial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas to rotate at super-Keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains. This senario presents a robust process for grain retention which may aid in the formation of proto-gas-giant cores preferentially near the snow line.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 29 th May 2018. Freeze drying {{microscopy}} {{has been used}} to probe the lyophilisation kinetics of lactose solutions of various concentrations, at temperatures ranging from - 50. °C to - 30. °C and under a constant pressure of 1. Pa. <b>Sublimation</b> <b>front</b> velocities were determined by recording a sequence of video images of the sublimation and analysing the frontal progression using MATLAB. Initial experiments showed poor reproducibility. To combat this, silver iodide (AgI) was added as an ice nucleator, which raised nucleation temperatures and improved reproducibility when compared to non-AgI experiments. The lower supercooling on nucleation when AgI was used also produced larger ice crystals, which enabled the crystal microstructure of the more dilute samples to be more clearly observed. This showed long thin crystals, and the orientation of these crystals with respect to the direction of the frontal movement strongly affected frontal progression rates, which explained the earlier reproducibility problems. A twin resistance mass transfer model, comprising a fixed edge resistance and a resistance which increased with frontal depth, was able to describe the sublimation kinetics. The edge resistance first increased and then decreased with solids content. The resistance per unit depth increased exponentially with solids content, so much so that there is an optimal solids content in relation to the rate of production of dried material. Resistances were also much higher when crystals were oriented with their major axis perpendicular to the direction of frontal movement. Freeze drying rates were approximately proportional to the saturation vapour pressure of water, however the long-held belief that water vapour pressure is the main driving force for mass transfer in freeze-drying systems may be an oversimplification as this only reflects driving forces in the vapour phase (pores) rather than within the solid...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Freeze-drying {{is the process of}} removal of water or organic solvent from a desired product by means of sublimation at a low temperature and low pressure. It is commonly employed for drying samples which are heat labile and require sensitive treatment, and is mainly used in the pharmaceutical and food industries. It is an expensive process, requiring vacuum, refrigeration and long cycle times, but does yield quality benefits due to the low temperatures involved and the porous nature of the product. Reducing drying times is important to manufacturers, and this depends on optimising rates of heat and mass transfer in the system without the sample losing its porous structure. However, freeze drying is difficult to study experimentally due to the low temperatures and pressures involved. The quality of the final product mainly depends on the sublimation rate and an optimum lyophilisation requires identification of the parameters which influence the process. The main aim {{of this study is to}} employ freeze drying microscopy (FDM) as a useful tool to identify these process parameters and help optimise primary drying phase of the freeze drying process for two systems: lactose (relevant to pharmaceuticals) and coffee (the most widely freeze-dried food product). This equipment allows the movement of sublimation fronts to be directly visualised in-situ under carefully controlled (and isothermal conditions), but has scarcely been used in the literature for this purpose. An image analysis method is developed to automatically track the movement of sublimation fronts, and the frontal data fitted to a simple mass transfer model employing surface and bulk resistances. Initial experiments with lactose solution show poor reproducibility in nucleation temperatures during the freezing step and thus primary drying rates. To improve reproducibility, a small amount of silver iodide (AgI) was added to samples which acts as a nucleating agent and increases the nucleation temperature. This addition of AgI also increases the mean ice crystal size in the samples and are easily visible under the freeze-drying microscope, and in many cases show a distinct orientation with respect to direction of <b>sublimation</b> <b>front.</b> Furthermore, the orientation greatly influences sublimation rates, being approximately factor of two faster when crystals are oriented in the direction of mass transfer. FDM experiments with coffee were less straightforward as nucleation temperatures could not be reliably controlled, even with AgI added. Nevertheless there was a clear decrease of bulk resistance with increasing nucleation temperature. An experimental programme was then undertaken to examine the impact of initial solid content, cooling rate, the addition of an annealing step, freeze drying temperature and aeration (for coffee samples). Frontal data were fitted to a simple mass transfer model comprising surface and bulk (per unit depth) resistances and good fits to data were obtained. FDM experiments with lactose and coffee clearly showed the presence of a surface resistance which could also be seen as a surface layer which was devoid of ice crystals (and hence not porous when sublimed). The edge resistance first increased and then decreased with solids content. The resistance per unit depth increased exponentially with solids content, so much so that there is an optimal solids content (around 10...|$|E
