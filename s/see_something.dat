The members of the ACLT freely volunteer their time in attempting to raise awareness in the Black community; enabling potential donors to come forward and be involved in the process of offering hope and a healthy future to someone whose disorder may otherwise prove fatal. Dixon has also backed Nickelodeon's <b>See</b> <b>Something,</b> Say Something campaign, a UK anti-bullying initiative.|$|E
5|$|People {{may simply}} like most {{what they see}} most. Letters that appear more {{frequently}} in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found {{a positive correlation between}} the frequency of occurrence of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you <b>see</b> <b>something,</b> the more you like it. Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not. He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to ambiguous sentences, Wittgenstein discussed figures {{that can be}} seen and understood in two different ways. Often one can <b>see</b> <b>something</b> in a straightforward way — seeing that it is a rabbit, perhaps. But, at other times, one notices a particular aspect — seeing it as something.|$|E
25|$|A further {{parameter}} is {{the method}} of feedback used and this is shown in studies of P300 signals. Patterns of P300 waves are generated involuntarily (stimulus-feedback) when people <b>see</b> <b>something</b> they recognize and may allow BCIs to decode categories of thoughts without training patients first. By contrast, the biofeedback methods described above require learning to control brainwaves so the resulting brain activity can be detected.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, Eliade {{argues that}} Westerners {{can learn from}} non-Western {{cultures}} to <b>see</b> <b>something</b> besides absurdity in suffering and death. Traditional cultures see suffering and death as a rite of passage. In fact, their initiation rituals often involve a symbolic death and resurrection, or symbolic ordeals followed by relief. Thus, Eliade argues, modern man can learn to see his historical ordeals, even death, as necessary initiations into {{the next stage of}} one's existence.|$|E
25|$|Floaters {{are able}} to catch and refract light in ways that {{somewhat}} blur vision temporarily until the floater moves to a different area. Often they trick persons who are troubled by floaters into thinking they <b>see</b> <b>something</b> {{out of the corner}} of their eye that really is not there. Most persons come to terms with the problem, after a time, and learn to ignore their floaters. For persons with severe floaters it is nearly impossible to completely ignore the large masses that constantly stay within almost direct view.|$|E

Moving closer, they can see first that it is a ship, then that it is a warship, and then that it is a Dellacondan warship. Finally, they can make out clearly the ship’s insignia – the famous markings of Corsarius, Christoper Sim’s own.|$|E
25|$|The Greek {{belief of}} ideal forms was later {{extended}} by Plato in his metaphysical theory of forms (ideai:ideas). The Greek word idea (ιδέα:idea) {{has the same}} roots with the words idein (ιδείν:to see), eidos (είδος:species), and probably with oida (οίδα:know), therefore one must <b>see</b> <b>something</b> in order to know it. Originally, the words were applied to such obvious forms as the human body. The transference of the words from visible to invisible show how the Greek mind moved from the gift of senses to the principles behind them which were also used {{in the art of}} sculpture.|$|E
25|$|The rectorate was {{an attempt}} to <b>see</b> <b>something</b> in the {{movement}} that had come to power, beyond all its failings and crudeness, that was much more far-reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the Germans' Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at the time I believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.|$|E

25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to <b>see</b> <b>something</b> that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E
25|$|The second series, Ben Harper, {{husband and}} father to three {{different}} and often difficult children, has spent his working life as a dentist. Just {{as well as most}} of his life seems rather like pulling teeth. His wife Susan is usually busy showing foreign tourists around London, a place she knows much better than her own kitchen. Ben and Susan have been married happily enough to have three children. However, Ben has the feeling that most of the time his children seem to speak a different language. Nick (20) has persuaded his parents he would benefit from a gap year to <b>see</b> <b>something</b> of the world, but he has hardly seen anything beyond the confines of the sofa. Janey (17) is into boys, fashion labels (expensive ones), and getting her own way. Michael (14) is the brightest of the trio. He is seriously into computers and not so seriously (yet) into girls.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle also {{includes}} in {{his theory of}} dreams what constitutes a dream and what does not. He claimed that a dream is first established {{by the fact that}} the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they <b>see</b> <b>something</b> in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that actually occurs while a person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, Aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the dream. The actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses, the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake.|$|E

25|$|From a {{biological}} point of view, human behaviors are {{essentially the same}} during crises accompanied by stock market crashes and during bubble growth when share prices exceed historic highs. During those periods, most market participants <b>see</b> <b>something</b> new for themselves, and this inevitably induces a stress response in them with accompanying changes in their endocrine profiles and motivations. The result is quantitative and qualitative changes in behavior. However, this is only one example of where behavior affecting economics and finance can be observed and variably-contrasted using behavioral economics, {{and it is a}} mistake to think of its usefulness as only applying within such environments tested-in or -of conditions similar to stock exchanges specifically. Also, often selfish-reasoning, 'adult behaviors', and similar, can be identified within criminal-concealment(s), and legal-deficiencies and neglect of different types can be observed and discovered. Awareness of indirect consequence (or lack of), at least in potential with different experimental models and methods, can be used as well—behavioral economics' potential uses are broad, but its reliability need scrutiny. An underestimation of the role of novelty as a stressor is the primary shortcoming of current approaches for market research. So, it is necessary to account for the biologically determined diphasisms of human behavior in everyday low-stress conditions and in response to stressors.|$|E
