40|$|Methods for {{measuring}} deformation and {{motion of the}} human heart in-vivo are crucial in the assessment of cardiac function. Applications ranging from basic physiological research, through early detection of disease to follow-up studies, all rely {{on the quality of the}} measurements of heart dynamics. This thesis presents new improved magnetic resonance imaging methods for acquisition, image reconstruction and visualization of cardiac motion and deformation. As the heart moves and changes shape during the acquisition, synchronization to the heart dynamics is necessary. Here, a method to resolve not only the cardiac cycle but also the respiratory cycle is presented. Combined with volumetric imaging, this produces a five-dimensional data set with two cyclic temporal dimensions. This type of data reveals unique physiological information, such as interventricular coupling in the heart in different phases of the respiratory cycle. The acquisition can also be sensitized to motion, measuring not only the magnitude of the magnetization but also a signal proportional to local velocity or displacement. This allows for quantification of the motion which is especially suitable for functional study of the cardiac deformation. In this work, an evaluation of the influence of several factors on the signal-to-noise ratio is presented for in-vivo displacement encoded imaging. Additionally, an extension of the method to acquire multiple displacement encoded slices in a single breath hold is also presented. Magnetic resonance imaging is usually associated with long scan times, and many methods exist to shorten the acquisition time while maintaining acceptable image quality. One class of such methods involves acquiring only a sparse subset of k-space. A special reconstruction is then necessary in order to obtain an artifact-free image. One family of these reconstruction techniques tailored for dynamic imaging is the k-t BLAST approach, which incorporates data-driven prior knowledge to suppress aliasing artifacts that otherwise occur with the sparse sampling. In this work, an extension of the original k-t BLAST method to two temporal dimensions is presented and applied to data acquired with full coverage of the cardio-respiratory cycles. Using this technique, termed k-t 2 BLAST, simultaneous reduction of scan time and improved spatial resolution is demonstrated. Further, the loss of temporal fidelity when using the k-t BLAST approach is investigated, and an improved reconstruction is proposed for the application of cardiac function analysis. Visualization is a crucial part of the imaging <b>chain.</b> <b>Scalar</b> data, such as regular anatomical images, are straightforward to display. Myocardial strain and strain-rate, however, are tensor quantities which do not lend themselves to direct visualization. The problem of visualizing the tensor field is approached in this work by combining a local visualization that displays all degrees of freedom for a single tensor with an overview visualization using a scalar field representation of the complete tensor field. The scalar field is obtained by iterated adaptive filtering of a noise field, creating a continuous geometrical representation of the myocardial strain-rate tensor field. The results of the work presented in this thesis provide opportunities for improved imaging of myocardial function, in all areas of the imaging chain; acquisition, reconstruction and visualization. ...|$|R
5000|$|The sum {{of these}} three types of {{interactions}} {{is the number of}} potential relationships of a supervisor. Graicunas showed with these formulas, that each additional subordinate increases the number of potential interactions significantly. It appears natural, that no organization can afford to maintain a control structure of a dimension being required for implementing a <b>scalar</b> <b>chain</b> under the unity of command condition. Therefore, other mechanisms had to be found for dealing with the dilemma of maintaining managerial control, while keeping cost and time at a reasonable level, thus making the span of control a critical figure for the organization. Consequently, for a long time, finding the optimum span of control has been a major challenge to organization design. As Mackenzie (1978, p 121) describes it:”One could argue that with larger spans, the costs of supervision would tend to be reduced, because a smaller percentage {{of the members of the}} organization are supervisors. On the other hand, if the span of control is too large, the supervisor may not have the capacity to supervise effectively such large numbers of immediate subordinates. Thus, there is a possible trade-off to be made in an attempt to balance these possibly opposing tendencies.” ...|$|E
40|$|To manage is", Henri Fayol said, "to {{forecast}} and plan, to organise, to command, to co-ordinate and to control. " As to the soundness {{and good}} working order of the organisation, these depend, he believed, on certain "principles". He stressed that these principles were not immutable laws, but rather rules of thumb {{to be used as}} the occasion demanded. These principles number - although the list has no precise limit - some fourteen in all and include division of work, authority, discipline, unity of command, unity of direction, subordination of individual interests to general interests, remuneration, centralisation, the <b>scalar</b> <b>chain</b> order, equity, stability of tenure of personnel, initiative and, finally, esprit de corps...|$|E
40|$|The {{responsibility}} of public managers includes designing processes that effectively operationalize policy mandates and contextual goals. The field of public administration {{has a long}} tradition of research and commentary on how to fulfill this responsibility. The classical administrative theorists fashioned a doctrine of organizational design that set forth such principles as unity of command and <b>scalar</b> <b>chain.</b> This doctrinal approach was roundly criticized by Herbert Simon (1946) nearly 60 years ago. Simon instead proposed that public managers engage in administrative analysis. This cognitive procedure included describing the functioning of particular organizations in terms of information processing and decision-making. It also included diagnosis, or identifying factors limiting organizational performance, analogous to specifying the binding constraints on the output of a physical system. He encouraged learning from experience by experimenting with structures and procedures intended to relax the constraints. He later admitted that administrative experimentation, in the literal sense, was rarely feasible (Simon 1976). Other scholars, such as James March (1999), have vigorousl...|$|E
