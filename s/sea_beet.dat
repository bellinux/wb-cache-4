5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid and carline thistle flower on the dunes, and Holkham's Corsican pines shelter creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest orchids.

Several alternative sources of CMS have been described.

40|$|The {{productivity}} of sugar beet is strongly limited by several biotic stresses, among them rhizomania (induced by Beet necrotic yellow vein virus, BNYVV) which causes yield losses of 20 – 50 % or more. The {{only way to}} control this disease {{is the use of}} resistant varieties. Sources of resistances have been found in the ancestor of the cultivated beets Beta vulgaris L. ssp. maritima (L.) Arcang. Rz 1 is the major resistance gene present within commercial sugar beet varieties. This resistance was recognized as monogenic and dominant. Experimental evidence highlighted that Rz 1 originated from <b>sea</b> <b>beets</b> belonging to Munerati’s genetic pool. The development of molecular markers linked to Rz 1 allows the use of marker assisted selection (MAS) to introgress this gene into pollinator lines, to assess the trueness of hybridity and to remove off-type individuals. MAS speeds variety development and reduces production costs guaranteeing {{at the same time a}} high qualitative standard in variety development. Recent studies have shown an emergence of new BNYVV strains with increased virulence that could overcome Rz 1 resistance. Therefore, exploitation of new genetic sources of resistance and the pyramiding of several resistance genes into new breeding lines is becoming a main priority for sugar beet breeding companies to maintain an adequate resistance level to rhizomania...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{diversity}} in worldwide population of beets is strongly {{affected by the}} domestication history, and the comparison of linkage disequilibrium in worldwide and elite populations highlights strong selection pressure. Genetic relationships and linkage disequilibrium (LD) were evaluated {{in a set of}} 2035 worldwide beet accessions and in another of 1338 elite sugar beet lines, using 320 and 769 single nucleotide polymorphisms, respectively. The structures of the populations were analyzed using four different approaches. Within the worldwide population, three of the methods gave a very coherent picture of the population structure. Fodder beet and sugar beet accessions were grouped together, separated from garden <b>beets</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>beets,</b> reflecting well the origins of beet domestication. The structure of the elite panel, however, was less stable between clustering methods, which was probably because of the high level of genetic mixing in breeding programs. For the linkage disequilibrium analysis, the usual measure (r (2)) was used, and compared with others that correct for population structure and relatedness (r (S) (2), r (V) (2), r (VS) (2)). The LD as measured by r (2) persisted beyond 10 cM within the elite panel and fell below 0. 1 after less than 2 cM in the worldwide population, for almost all chromosomes. With correction for relatedness, LD decreased under 0. 1 by 1 cM for almost all chromosomes in both populations, except for chromosomes 3 and 9 within the elite panel. In these regions, the larger extent of LD could be explained by strong selection pressure...|$|R
25|$|Beta vulgaris (beet) is a plant {{which is}} {{included}} in Betoideae subfamily in the Amaranthaceae family. It is the economically most important crop of the large order Caryophyllales.

40|$|Resistance gene analogs (RGAs) were searched bioinformatically in {{the sugar}} beet (Beta vulgaris L.) genome as {{potential}} candidates for improving resistance against different diseases. In the present study, Ion Torrent sequencing technology was used to identify mutations in 21 RGAs. The DNA samples of ninety-six individuals from six <b>sea</b> <b>beets</b> (Beta vulgaris L. subsp. maritima) and six sugar beet pollinators (eight individuals each) {{were used for the}} discovery of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Target amplicons of about 200 bp in length were designed with the Ion AmpliSeq Designer system in order to cover the DNA sequences of the RGAs. The number of SNPs ranged from 0 in four individuals to 278 in the pollinator R 740 (which is resistant to rhizomania infection). Among different groups of beets, cytoplasmic male sterile lines had the highest number of SNPs (132) whereas the lowest number of SNPs belonged to O-types (95). The principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) showed that the polymorphisms inside the gene Bv 8 _ 184910 _pkon (including the CCCTCC sequence) can effectively differentiate wild from cultivated beets, pointing at a possible mutation associated to rhizomania resistance that originated directly from cultivated beets. This is unlike other resistance sources that are introgressed from wild beets. This gene belongs to the receptor-like kinase (RLK) class of RGAs, and is associated to a hypothetical protein. In conclusion, this first report of using Ion Torrent sequencing technology in beet germplasm suggests that the identified sequence CCCTCC can be used in marker-assisted programs to differentiate wild from domestic beets and to identify other unknown disease resistance genes in beet...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{most studies}} of genetic {{variation}} utilise molecular markers, {{making it possible}} to detect variation at the DNA level. This has greatly facilitated studies of genetic variation in population and evolutionary genetics, systematics and transmission genetics. By studying the inheritance of molecular markers in crosses, it is possible to map the markers, i. e. to determine their genomic positions. Utilising mapped markers can make studies of genetic variation much more efficient. The present thesis explores several different applications of molecular markers requiring that the genomic positions be known, using beet (Beta vulgaris) as a model. Marker maps are often the basis for mapping genes of interest. Gene mapping studies usually focus on qualitative variation in traits determined by a single gene. Such genes are fairly easy to map in crosses segregating for the trait, although the resolution for the map position may be poor unless very large samples are studied. One method to increase the resolution is to use linkage disequilibrium mapping, which has been successfully employed in mapping several human disease genes. I have explored the possibility of using this method in plants as well, taking the gene for annuality in beets as an example. Mapping the genes responsible for variation in quantitative traits is much more complicated, since the genotypes in the genes cannot be observed directly. An example of the mapping of a quantitative trait, namely Cercospora resistance in beet, is included in the thesis. Utilising a high-density AFLP map, five genes were detected and mapped. Two different topics in population genetics that require mapped markers are presented. First, the distribution of linkage disequilibrium in both wild and cultivated beets is investigated. It is shown that linkage disequilibrium is only present between markers that are tightly linked. This result has important implications for an understanding both of the genetics underlying evolution and of how to conduct linkage disequilibrium mapping in beets. Secondly, I have studied the relation between levels of genetic variation and of recombination in natural populations of <b>sea</b> <b>beets.</b> The neutral theory predicts that genomic regions of high and low recombination should be equally variable. Results of empirical investigations in Drosophila are not in line with this prediction. Several non-neutral explanations have been invoked. Our study {{is one of the first}} on this topic in any other organism than Drosophila. The results show that the same positive correlation between levels of genetic variation and of recombination as in Drosophila is found in beets...|$|R
