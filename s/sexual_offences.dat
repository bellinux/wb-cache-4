According to Minister of Law and Justice Ashwani Kumar, 90 percent of the suggestions given by the Verma Committee Report were incorporated into the Ordinance.

It is estimated that sexual recidivists coming {{to the attention of the}} police will come from three sources: just under one third from offenders who are convicted and in high-risk categories, around one third from those who are convicted and in the more numerous low/medium-risk categories and around one third from those strongly suspected of, but not convicted for, a <b>sexual</b> <b>offence...</b>|$|R

Also, if the offender has a previous conviction for any <b>sexual</b> <b>offence</b> (it {{does not have to be}} the same <b>sexual</b> <b>offence</b> for which they're now being sentenced), or if they are convicted of more than one primary designated offence, or if they're already under a previously-issued Order or Notice, the minimum term that will apply is life.|$|R

5|$|In Britain gay saunas were {{routinely}} raided by police {{up until the}} end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham, the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of gross indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the <b>Sexual</b> <b>Offences</b> Act 2003.|$|E

The première was controversial, in particular because it depicted the character Nathan, aged 15, in sexual intercourse with an older man; the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom received 136 complaints and the series received criticism from Hunnam's parents and from activist Mary Whitehouse. The controversy was amplified when the sponsor Beck's withdrew after several episodes and homosexual activists complained that the series was not representative of gay culture. Nevertheless, the show garnered 3.5million viewers per episode and a generally positive reaction from fans, and was renewed for a two-episode special due for the following year.|$|E

It also is checking the possibility of setting up fast-track courts to dispose of pending cases pertaining to crimes against women. The Government of Tamil Nadu also announced a 13-point action plan to ensure safety of women in Tamil Nadu and said that incidents of sexual assault would be treated as a grave crime, and probes would be entrusted to top police officials. The chief minister also said that daily hearings would be conducted in all sexual abuse cases in the state for speedy trials at specially constituted fast-track courts, and women prosecutors would be appointed as government counsels. The Jammu and Kashmir government also announced plans to change the state's laws against <b>sexual</b> <b>offences</b> and gender crimes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the factors predicting recidivism among a sample of 222 federally sentenced sex offenders. Based on social and criminal data, a number of predictor variables were significantly correlated with recidivism. These variables were regressed into models of recidivism which resulted in low levels of predictability. There were, however, three prominent factors found in each model for non-sexual offence recidivism, including age, extent of criminal history and number of geographical locations where previously convicted. The results also indicated a number of trends based on correlational data. In particular, a distinction was found between <b>sexual</b> and non-sexual <b>offence</b> recidivism. General non-sexual offence recidivism was found to be associated with extent of prior criminal history and age, while <b>sexual</b> <b>offence</b> recidivism was found to be associated with extent of <b>sexual</b> <b>offence</b> history and not influenced by age...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the association of hostility, {{as measured by the}} Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI), with offence characteristics and recidivism in 656 adult male sexual offenders. Principle components analysis indicated the BDHI contained only one component with the present sample. Hostility was significantly associated with having prior violent charges, the use of violence in the index <b>sexual</b> <b>offence,</b> <b>sexual</b> recidivism, and violent recidivism. After controlling for risk level, as measured by the Rapid Risk Assessment for <b>Sexual</b> <b>Offence</b> Recidivism (RRASOR), the significant association between hostility and sexual and violent recidivism remained. When examined by type of offender, hostility was significantly associated with recidivism in intrafamilial and extrafamilial child molesters, but not in rapists or mixed offenders. Given the predictive value of hostility beyond the RRASOR, and its dynamic nature, the present findings confirm and encourage treatment efforts directed toward the management of hostility and anger in sexual offenders...|$|R
