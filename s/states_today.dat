5|$|Wood Badge was {{introduced}} to America by Baden-Powell and the first course was held in 1936 at the Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation, the Boy Scouts of America national training center until 1979. Despite this early first course, Wood Badge was not formally adopted in the United States until 1948 {{under the guidance of}} Bill Hillcourt who became national Deputy Camp Chief of the United <b>States.</b> <b>Today</b> the national training center of the Boy Scouts of America is the Philmont Training Center, which hosts a few camps each year. Nearly all Wood Badge courses are held throughout the country at local council camps under the auspices of each BSA region.|$|E
5|$|As Emmanuil Gushansky <b>states,</b> <b>today</b> {{subjective}} {{position of}} a Russian patient toward a medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents the attempt to understand the patient and help him assess his condition. Such a position is related to constant, subconscious fear of psychiatrists and psychiatry. This fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry, but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society. The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence {{is related to the}} primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors. Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian psychiatry and the structure of providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting the patient's right to an own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.|$|E
5|$|Although too old {{to serve}} in the military, Blackburn {{supported}} the Confederate cause during the Civil War. In {{the early days of the}} war, he acted as a civilian agent for the governments of Kentucky and Mississippi. By 1863, he was aiding Confederate blockade runners in Canada. In 1864, he traveled to Bermuda to help combat a yellow fever outbreak that threatened Confederate blockade running operations there. Shortly after the war's end, a Confederate double agent accused him of having carried out a plot to start a yellow fever epidemic in the Northern United States that would have hampered the Union war effort. Blackburn was accused of collecting linens and garments used by yellow fever patients and smuggling them into the Northern states to be sold. The evidence against Blackburn was considerable, although much of it was either circumstantial or provided by witnesses of questionable reputation. Although he was acquitted by a Toronto court, public sentiment was decidedly against him throughout much of the United <b>States.</b> <b>Today,</b> historians still disagree as to the strength of the evidence supporting Blackburn's role in the alleged plot. Any plot of this nature was destined to fail, however; in 1900, Walter Reed discovered that yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, not by contact.|$|E

25|$|The American Quarter Horse, or Quarter Horse, is an American {{breed of}} horse that excels at sprinting short distances.

25|$|During the 19th century, Amrum {{still had}} a {{considerably}} lower population than today. Church records from 1821 to 1833 show an average population of 587, a census in 1860 noted 642 inhabitants, and in 1871, the population had dropped to 571. Among other factors, the decrease owed {{to the fact that}} large parts of Amrum's population had emigrated — mainly to the United <b>States.</b> <b>Today,</b> more people with ancestors from Amrum live in the United States than there are on Amrum proper, and the connections between Amrum and the U.S. are still being cultivated.|$|E

In addition, there are high-tech firms and telemarketing companies, including Medtronic Inc., in the city.

25|$|Fifteen {{years after}} he had arrived in Pittsburgh, Father Hehir became {{president}} of the Pittsburgh Catholic College, succeeding Father John Murphy on August 20, 1899.

He also reconciled the college debt by 1900.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{difference}} between the European races or subspecies of bees kept by beekeepers and the African stock is attributable to both selective breeding and natural selection. By selecting only the most gentle, non-defensive races, beekeepers have, over centuries, eliminated the more defensive races and created a number of subspecies suitable for apiculture. The most common race used in Europe and the United <b>States</b> <b>today</b> is the Italian bee, Apis mellifera ligustica, which {{has been used for}} over a thousand years {{in some parts of the}} world and in the Americas since the arrival of the European colonists.|$|E
