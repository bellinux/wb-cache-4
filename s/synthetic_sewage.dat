A lab-scale sewage treatment plant (behrotest® Laborkläranlage KLD 4 N, behr Labor Technik GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany) with a denitrification, nitrification and secondary clarifier was used. The {{validity of the test}} was reached when 80 % of the introduced DOC concentration (100 mg/L) had been eliminated by the microorganisms. Six systems were running as a control, four systems with continuous addition (influent) of AgNP at 0.04, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg/L, and another with silver nitrate at 0.4 mg/L. The room temperature was kept at 20 °C to 25 °C. The oxygen level was controlled to range from 2 to 3.5 mg/L in the aeration vessel over the whole test period. The STP was set to run with a retention time of 6 h and a continuous flow of 750 mL/h containing a mixture of <b>synthetic</b> <b>sewage,</b> tap water and Ag stock dispersion mixed within a tube system (<b>synthetic</b> <b>sewage</b> was mixed with water and then with the AgNP resulting in a dilution of 1 : 10). The AgNPs were applied into the denitrification section. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>sewage</b> and AgNP stock dispersion were prepared as a tenfold concentration, as mentioned in the guideline, and stored at 4 °C in a refrigerator. The pH of the sewage sludge in the non-aerated and aerated vessels was consistently measured. Continuous reflux from the nitrification section into the denitrification section of 1.75 L/h was performed to avoid a decrease of pH. At test start, the sewage sludge was introduced into the STP and tap water was added to end up with a dry matter content of 2.5 g/L. For 3 days, the sewage sludge was adapted to laboratory conditions by continuously feeding it with just <b>synthetic</b> <b>sewage</b> before the addition of the AgNP for 10 days started. The dry matter content of sludge was determined periodically. The concentration of nitrate, nitrite and ammonia was checked photometrically in the effluent with test kits (Nanocolor, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), and the flow rate was checked and adjusted if necessary. The DOC was measured daily in the influent flow and effluent.|$|E

We compared the quinone profiles of EBPR sludges and standard sludges, of natural sewage and <b>synthetic</b> <b>sewage,</b> and of plant scale and laboratory scale systems. Ubiquinone (Q) and menaquinone (MK) components were detected in all sludges tested at molar MK/Q ratios of 0. 455 to 0. 981. The differences in MK/Q ratios were much larger when we compared different wastewater sludges (i. e., raw sewage and <b>synthetic</b> <b>sewage)</b> than when we compared sludges from the EBPR and standard processes or plant scale and laboratory scale systems. In all sludges tested a Q with eight isoprene units (Q- 8) was the most abundant quinone. In the MK fraction, either tetrahydrogenated MK- 8 or MK- 7 was the predominant type, {{and there was also}} a significant proportion of MK- 6 to MK- 8 in most cases. A numerical cluster analysis of the profiles showed that the sludges tested fell into two major clusters; one included all raw sewage sludges, and the other consisted of all <b>synthetic</b> <b>sewage</b> sludges, independent of the operational mode and scale of the reactors and the phosphate accumulation. These data suggested that Q- 8 -containing species belonging to the class Proteobacteria (i. e., species belonging to the beta subclass) were the major constituents of the bacterial populations in the EBPR sludge, as well as in standard activated sludge. Members of the class Actinobacteria (gram-positive bacteria with high DNA G+C contents) were the second most abundant group in both types of sludge.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 Methods for the {{detection}} and measurement of waste materials in water have lagged far behind the many complex problems facing workers in the water pollution field. The present study introduces a new method for {{the detection}} and measurement of organic pollution in water. This new method, the persulfate oxidation, is compared with other methods already adopted for the measurement of organic pollution in water. A wide variety of pure organic compounds that were considered representative of substances found in sewage were analyzed by the persulfate oxidation procedure. Excellent carbon recoveries were obtained for single compound solutions as well as multiple compound mixtures of water-soluble carbohydrates, organic acids, alcohols and amino acids in dilute solution. By analyzing dilute glucose solutions and more complex prepared <b>synthetic</b> <b>sewages,</b> as well as raw domestic sewage and trade waste, {{it was found that}} the 5 -day BOD could be predicted from data obtained from the POC method. It was necessary, however, to derive a different regression coefficient for the raw domestic and trade wastes than was used for the prepared synthetic wastes. A statistical analysis of the data obtained revealed a positive correlation of 0. 998 between the POC and the 5 -day BOD. In addition, there was only a 3 per cent coefficient of variation for the data obtained by the persulfate method compared to a 10 per cent coefficient of variation for the 5 -day BOD. The predicted 5 -day BOD (BOD[subscript c]) obtained from the persulfate oxidation was compared with the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the total carbon (TOC) procedure. It was subsequently determined that the persulfate oxidation measured only a fraction of the carbon oxidized by the COD or TOC methods. In addition, wastes of similar chemical composition exhibited constant and characteristic COD/BOD[subscript c] ratios. There was, however, no evidence to support any relationship between TOC and BOD[subscript c]. It was felt significant that the BOD[subscript c] based upon the POC levels provided data equally as useful as that obtained by the classical 5 -day BOD. The identity of persulfate oxidizable carbon was only partially elucidated. It has thus far been determined that the POC fraction comprises a greater carbon fraction than is oxidized during the 5 -day BOD, but is considerably less than is measured by either the COD or the TOC procedures. The carbon fraction measured by the persulfate was, however, identified as the carbon fraction oxidized biochemically during first stage aerobic stabilization...|$|R

Acetic acid was the dominant fatty acid in the early operation stage in both cases. In {{the case of the}} biofilm, biogas production at 20 h hydraulic retention time was severely repressed to around 50 ml/L-reactor/h when propionic acid was sharply increased after 20 days of operation.

The hydrogen gas content in the biogas was in the range of 40 - 60 % and no methane was detected either case. Since granular sludge harboured more microorganisms and its density was higher than the biofilm on PVA medium, granulation was considered to be a better method for continuous hydrogen gas production.

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide {{generation}} {{is a major}} issue in sewer management. A novel method based on electrochemical sulfide oxidation was recently shown to be highly effective for sulfide removal from <b>synthetic</b> and real <b>sewage.</b> Here, we compare the performance of five different mixed metal oxide (MMO) coated titanium electrode materials for the electrochemical removal of sulfide from domestic wastewater. All electrode materials performed similarly in terms of sulfide removal, removing 78 +/- 5 %, 77 +/- 1 %, 85 +/- 4 %, 84 +/- 1 %, and 83 +/- 2 % at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) using Ta/Ir, Au/Ir, Pt/Ir, SnO(2) and PbO(2), respectively. Elevated chloride concentrations, often observed in coastal areas, did not entail any significant difference in performance. Independent of the electrode material used, sulfide oxidation by in situ generated oxygen was the predominant reaction mechanism. Passivation of the electrode surface by deposition of elemental sulfur did not occur. However, scaling was observed in the cathode compartment. This study shows that all the MMO coated titanium electrode materials studied are suitable anodic materials for sulfide removal from wastewater. Ta/Ir and Pt/Ir coated titanium electrodes seem the most suitable electrodes since they possess the lowest overpotential for oxygen evolution, are stable at low chloride concentration and are already used in full scale applications.

40|$|A novel saline sewage {{treatment}} process, namely a sulfate reduction, autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated process (SANI process), {{has been developed}} at HKUST. The process consists of an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB), an anoxic filter and an aerobic filter. The goal of this novel process is to achieve {{a significant reduction in}} excess sludge production as well as in treatment cost and space. The objective of this study is therefore to investigate the performance of each unit reactor of the SANI process and its overall performance in removal of organic matter and nitrogen. The research emphases were placed on the impact of recirculation flow ratios between both filters on the autotrophic denitrification in the anoxic filter. A lab-scale of the SANI system was operated continuously with <b>synthetic</b> saline <b>sewage.</b> The performance was mainly assessed by monitoring TOC removal rate, nitrogen removal rate, sulfur balance, and sludge yield. The proposed system has been successfully operated for more than 360 days with an organic loading rate at 0. 14 kg TOC/m 3 /d. The TOC removal efficiency was 80 - 85 %. The nitrogen removal efficiency was found {{to be sensitive to the}} recirculation flow rate of the aerobic filter effluent to the anoxic filter. When this rate was controlled at 3 Q (Q is the system influent flow rate), the system achieved more than 70 % of total nitrogen (TN) removal. However, a further increase in this rate resulted in poor performance of the system in terms of TOC and TN removal. Batch kinetic experiment results revealed that autotrophic denitrifying bacteria (ADB) and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria (HDB) coexisted and shared the utilization of nitrate for denitrification in the anoxic filter. ADB were proven to be more actively participating in the denitrification than HDB. Key parameters of Vmax_ADB, KNOx_ADB, and KH 2 S in the proposed bio-kinetics for ADB were estimated to be 22. 8 mg/hr, 15. 1 mg N/L, and 15. 8 mg S/L, respectively. Further studies on the autotrophic denitrification process in the anoxic filter showed that the anoxic filter was sensitive to the concentration of DO in its influent. If the influent contained 50 mg N/L nitrate, the denitrification efficiency would decrease from 92. 5 to 81 % when the influent DO level increased from 0 - 1 to 2 - 3 mg/L...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of iron compounds on growth inhibition of Sphaerotilus species was compared. In this study, two strains of Sphaerotilus were tested with different iron concentrations in a <b>synthetic</b> <b>sewage</b> (S-medium) as formulated by Lackey and Wattie (Sewage Works J. 12 : 669 - 684, 1940). For both strains, > 80 % inhibition {{of the maximum}} respiration rate was obtained by the following levels of soluble iron concentrations at pH 6. 0 : iron citrate, 20 mg/liter as Fe; iron cysteine, 5 mg/liter as Fe; and ferrous sulfate, 10 mg/liter as Fe. At a pH of 6. 7 with iron citrate (20 mg/liter as Fe), inhibition of both strains was in excess of 50 %. Insoluble iron compounds, such as iron hydroxides and ferrous carbonate, {{were found to be}} much less effective than the soluble iron compounds as inhibitors of these two strains. Aged iron hydroxide (500 mg/liter as Fe) produced a 70 % inhibition in the maximum respiration rate while fresh iron hydroxide (52 mg/liter as Fe) and ferrous carbonate (500 mg/liter as Fe) produced a 20 % inhibition. Chemical analyses of the iron-inhibited Sphaerotilus strains showed a close relationship between the inhibition of the organism's growth and the amount of iron sorbed by the organism...|$|E
40|$|Wheat straw {{is a major}} {{potential}} source of waste biomass for renewable energy production, but its high salt content causes problems in combustion. The salts can be removed by washing, but this process also removes a proportion of the organic material which could potentially be recovered by anaerobic digestion of the washwater leachate. This approach would maximise the overall energy yield in an integrated process in which washwater could be recycled after further desalting. Leachate from cold water washing with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 1. 2 g l? 1 was fed to mesophilic upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) digesters at a loading rate of 1 g COD l? 1 day? 1 to determine the energy yield and any detrimental effects of the leached salts on the process. The specific methane production was 0. 29 l CH 4 g? 1 CODadded, corresponding to a COD removal rate of 84 %. Light metal cations in the leachate, especially potassium, were found to accumulate in the digesters and appeared to have a synergistic effect up to a concentration of ? 6. 5 mg K g? 1 wet weight of the granular sludge, but further accumulation caused inhibition of methanogenesis. It was shown that gas production in the inhibited digesters could be restored within 12 days by switching the feed to a <b>synthetic</b> <b>sewage,</b> which washed the accumulated K out of the digesters...|$|E
40|$|Investigating the behaviour, {{fate and}} {{transport}} of Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) in {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs) is of great importance due to their presence in many consumer products and its potential to be toxic to environmental organisms. In this study, the transformation and fate of Ag-NPs was assessed using a multi-method characterisation approach, prior-to, during and post-aeration in the pilot sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and over a 21 day period in SBR. Synthesized 10 nm citrate and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) coated Ag-NPs were spiked into OECD <b>synthetic</b> <b>sewage</b> (OECDss) media and it constituents and in the (OECDss + activated sludge (AS) media. Ag-NPs show agglomeration, dissolution and changes in surface chemistry at all measured time points i. e., at 0 hrs, at 24 hrs, at 45 hrs (during aeration) and at 48 hrs (during settling) and indicated that 80 % of the citrate and PVP Ag-NPs could be removed {{in the form of}} Ag 2 S, AgCl and Silver Phosphate-NPs. More than 50 % of Ag-NPs accumulated within the sludge over a 21 day period (with no addition of fresh AS), and this occurred via physical adsorption {{on the surface of the}} AS flocs. This work demonstrates that Ag-NPs in wastewater can undergo a range of transformation processes, which include oxidation, dissolution, agglomeration, precipitation in an SBR pilot plant...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{has been}} developed which measures the settling velocity distribution of particles within a complete sewage sample. The development of the test method included observations of particle and liquid interaction using both <b>synthetic</b> media and <b>sewage.</b> Comparison studies with two other currently used settling velocity test procedures was undertaken. The method is suitable for use with either DWF or storm sewage. Information relating to the catchment characteristics of 35 No. wastewater treatment works was collected from the privatised water companies in England and Wales. 29 No. of these sites were used in an experimental programme to determine the settling velocity grading of 33 No. sewage samples. The collected data were analysed {{in an attempt to}} relate the settling velocity distribution to the characteristics of the contributing catchment. Statistical analysis of the catchment data and the measured settling velocity distributions was undertaken. A curve fitting exercise using an S-shaped curve which had the same physical characteristics as the settling velocity distributions was performed. None of these analyses found evidence that the settling velocity distribution of sewage had a significant relationship with the chosen catchment characteristics. The regression equations produced from the statistical analysis cannot be used to assist in the design of separation devices. However, a grading curve envelope was produced, the limits of which were clearly defined for the measured data set. There was no evidence of a relationship between settling velocity grading and the characteristics of the contributing catchment, particularly the catchment area. The present empirical approach to settling tank design cannot be improved upon at present by considering the variation in catchment parameters. This study has provided a basis for future research into the settling velocity measurement and should be of benefit to future workers within this field...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a combined biological aerated filter (BAF) and an ultrafiltration (UF) system {{for the treatment of}} real and <b>synthetic</b> greywater, settled <b>sewage,</b> rainwater and borehole water has been assessed at both full-scale (at the Millennium Dome Water Recycling plant) and bench-scale. Irreversible membrane fouling was explained at bench-scale in terms of a simple but novel model whereby a proportion of the membrane area is progressively blocked, in proportion to the square root of the transmembrane pressure. This model provides a link between irreversible fouling and reversible cake filtration theory, as the predicted reduction in effective filtration area leads to increased solids loading on the unblocked area. In addition, the bulk properties (specific cake resistance and compressibility) of the filter cakes formed from biologically-treated real grey water and sewage were found to be indistinguishable. A statistical analysis of the results of longer term irreversible fouling trials at bench- scale led to numerical relationships between fouling rate and process conditions. These relationships facilitated the development of a process optimisation model, with the dual-aim of maximising output and minimising chemical consumption. At full-scale, a statistical technique was developed for calculating the relative fouling propensity of three water sources (real grey water, rainwater and borehole water) that were combined in the feed to a UP membrane. The technique was based on the relative volumes of the three sources and the mean operating trans membrane pressure. In addition, the impact of mechanical reliability on the financial viability of the full- scale plant was investigated. A Net Present Value analysis revealed that the break- even price (BEP) of the recycled water was reduced from £ 1. 611 m 3 to £ 1. 40 /m 3 through increasing availability from 73. 8 % to 91. 2 %, and this can be achieved by investing in a targeted critical spares facility...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} associated with the transportation of sewage in sewer pipes has been the formation of hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S). In addition to being an odour nuisance, H 2 S emissions exceeding 1 mg/L are categorised as a health risk and can enhance corrosion potential in concrete sewer pipes. The main processes involving sulphur in gravity sewers are sulphide generation and emission of hydrogen sulphide into the sewer atmosphere. H 2 S is produced from sulphate present in sewage through reduction reactions by sulphate-reducing bacteria. As the average pH of sewage is normally around 7, sulphide usually exists in the form of HS- ions and aqueous H 2 S. When certain conditions apply, aqueous H 2 S crosses the air-water interface and diffuses into the sewer pipe atmosphere. Many researchers have examined the formation and emission of H 2 S and have developed models to predict the concentration of sulphide both in sewage and sewer pipe atmosphere. The formation and emission of H 2 S in sewer systems is governed by a large number of factors. These factors include temperature, pH, hydraulic conditions (i. e. sewage velocity), sewage characteristics and ventilation. In recent years, Australia has suffered from drought, which has led to a number of water conservation practices being implemented throughout the country. In Melbourne alone, a number of water restrictions have been put in place by the government. These new restrictions have led to reductions in quantities of sewage flowing through the sewers, which in turn have had a major impact on hydraulics in sewer pipes. This reduction in quantity of sewage has reduced flushing of the system and is likely to affect the characteristics of sewage and consequently increase potential problems of safety, odour and corrosion due to the build-up of hydrogen sulphide within the sewer. Results showed that using <b>synthetic</b> toilet <b>sewage</b> that contained 29. 5 mg/L sulphate, a higher aqueous sulphide concentration was measured compared to that at 18. 2 mg/L. the aqueous sulphide concentration increased by 89. 3 % with the 11. 3 mg/L increase in the sulphate concentration. Similarly, a higher CODs concentration, 36. 8 % increase was obtained with a 21. 4 % increase in the aqueous sulphide concentration. Increasing the sewage velocity by 85. 7 % increased the sulphide build-up rate by 15. 4 %. The concentrations of sulphide predicted using the two-phase model were in agreement with those measured using the laboratory sewer pipe in terms of trend but agreement in terms of value varied. The predictions of H 2 S in the atmosphere were higher by 50 to 85 % than measured concentrations. The model was also used to predict the sulphide concentrations at different sewage conditions...|$|R
