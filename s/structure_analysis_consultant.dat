40|$|The {{asymptotically}} distributed free (ADF) {{method is}} often used to estimate parameters or test models without a normal distribution assumptions on variables, both in covariance <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> and in correlation <b>structure</b> <b>analysis.</b> However, little has been done to study the differences in behaviors of the ADF method in covariance <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> and correlation <b>structure</b> <b>analysis.</b> In this thesis the behaviors of the ADF method in covariance <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> and correlation <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> were studied for three test statistics, chi-square test T AGLS and its small-sample improvements T YB and T F(AGLS). Results showed that the ADF method in correlation <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> with test statistic T AGLS performs much better at small sample sizes than the corresponding test for covariance structures. However, test statistics T YB and T F(AGLS) under the same conditions generally perform better with covariance structures than with correlation structures. Results also showed that condition numbers of weight matrices are systematically increased with substantial increase in variance as sample size decreases. Implications for research and practice are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Local protein <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{informative}} to protein <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> and {{has been}} used successfully in protein structure prediction and others. Proteins have recurring structural features, such as helix caps and beta turns, which often have strong amino acid sequence preferences. And the challenges for local <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> have been identification and assignment of such common short structural motifs. This paper proposes a new mathematical framework {{that can be applied}} to analysis of the local structure of proteins, where local conformations of protein backbones are described using differential geometry of folded tetrahedron sequences. Using the framework, we could capture the recurring structural features without any structural templates, which makes local <b>structure</b> <b>analysis</b> not only simpler, but also more objective. Programs and examples are available fro...|$|R
