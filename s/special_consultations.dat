40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the law {{applicable}} to insurance contracts in the EU, most notably on the Regulation No 593 / 2008 on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations (Rome I), which will replace the Rome Convention. The conflict of law rules relating to insurance contracts have {{always been one of}} the most complicated areas in (European) private international law. The conflict rules emanate from diverse sources - various directives and the Rome Convention - and lack cohesion and uniformity. The conversion of the Rome Convention into the Rome I Regulation was an excellent opportunity to get rid of this maze and to formulate uniform conflict rules for insurance contracts. The Commission proposal did not include a rule on insurance contracts, but a special rule was introduced during the negotiations. The difficult negotiations on this provision demonstrated clearly the complexity and delicacy of the matter. Various proposals were put forward and <b>special</b> <b>consultations</b> were launched, but the final result, laid down in Article 7 Rome I, seems to be no more than a complex compromise. The Regulation of international insurance contracts still remains unnecessarily complicated, fragmented and incomprehensible. In my opinion, therefore, the new rule in Article 7 is disappointing. Rather than removing the current divergences, the introduction of Article 7 mainly conceals them. It may be hoped that on the occasion of the evaluation of the Rome I Regulation, the conflict rules on insurance contracts will be carefully reconsidered...|$|E
40|$|The {{blind and}} those with serious visual handicaps {{are one of the}} groups of {{disabled}} whose integration into the labour market is generally only possible if special assistance is provided for the initial integration and later on for safeguarding the employment relationship. These tasks are taken on by the institutions responsible for rehabilitation and - for the continued safe-guarding of the employment - the main welfare institutions. As a result of their disability the blind {{and those with}} serious visual handicaps are severely restricted with regard to the spectrum of activities they are able to perform. It is, however, possible to achieve good integration results through workplace layout and special training measures. In the area of occupational integration, however, these types of measures are among the most complicated and the most costly. It is therefore appropriate for this reason among others to evaluate the success of the measure as early as possible and if necessary to adjust it in individual cases in order to achieve the desired integration success. Modern technical development in the field of EDP has opened up considerable workplace lay-out possibilities for the blind and partially sighted in particular for office activities. Modern EDP output devices suitable for the disabled are available with a Braille line, which shows the EDP data in Braille, line by line and character-coded, as well as with diverse large print systems which enlarge sections of the screen up to about 8 times the usual size. One of the main welfare institutions has focused its advice and assistance offers for blind and partially sighted people on PC-assisted workplaces within the framework of a special programme. In this special programme a measure was implemented in which 60 office workplaces of blind people or people with serious visual handicaps were assessed by external manpower studies specialists with regard to the integration success and follow-up support. The reason for these <b>special</b> <b>consultations,</b> which although costly also provided informative results, was the considerable difficulties arising for blind people or people with serious visual handicaps with the conversion of EDP technology to graphic user interfaces. Basically in the course of these processes of technical change, extensive technical modernisation and above all a retraining programme must take place in order to safeguard the jobs of blind and partially sighted people. There are, however, also consequences for the institution and those responsible there, who are supposed to ensure the ongoing safeguarding of the jobs.

We were in possession of information {{to the effect that}} the great majority {{of the people of the}} Transvaal were reconciled to annexation; we were told that if we reversed the decision of the late government, there would be a great probability of civil war and anarchy; and acting upon these representations, we decided that we could not recommend the Queen to relinquish her sovereignty. But we assured the Boers that we would take the earliest opportunity of granting to them the freest and most complete local institutions compatible with the welfare of South Africa. It is easy to be wise after the event. It is easy to see now that we were wrong in so deciding. I frankly admit we made a mistake.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Families of internationally adopted {{children}} may face specific problems with which general practitioners (GPs) {{may not be}} familiar. The aim {{of the study was}} to explore problems faced by families before, during and after the arrival of their internationally adopted child and to assess the usefulness of a specific medical structure for internationally {{adopted children}}, which could be a resource for the GP. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a qualitative study using individual semistructured guided conversations and interviewed 21 families that had adopted a total of 26 children internationally in the Puy de Dome department, France, in 2003. Quantitative data were used to describe the pathologies diagnosed and the investigations performed. Our study showed that the history of these families, from the start of the adoption project to its achievement, is complex and warrants careful analysis. Health-care providers should not only consider the medical aspects of adoption, but should also be interested in the histories of these families, which may play a role in the forming of attachments between the adoptee and their adoptive parents and prevent further trouble during the development of the child. We also showed that adoptive parents have similar fears or transient difficulties that may be resolved quickly by listening and reassurance. Most such families would support the existence of a specific medical structure for internationally adopted children, which could be a resource for the general practitioner. However, the health-care providers interviewed were divided on the subject and expressed their fear that a <b>special</b> <b>consultation</b> could be stigmatizing to children and families. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A specific consultation with well-trained and experienced practitioners acting in close collaboration with GPs and paediatricians may be of help in better understanding and supporting adopted children and their families...|$|R

40|$|To {{create a}} more {{inclusive}} school, an increase in multidisciplinary cooperation is needed. One possible form of collaboration could encompass the special education teacher taking {{on the role of}} a consultant for other teachers in need of support in working with heterogeneous groups of pupils. Previous research shows that special education teachers see the role as consultant as diffuse and complex. The overarching aim of the present study involves deepening the knowledge on how <b>consultation</b> in a <b>special</b> educational context can be understood and developed based on teachers’ descriptions on this particular form of activity interpreted against various perspectives on consultation. The study is qualitative in nature and rests on a hermeneutic interpretive research tradition in combination with an abductive approach. The theoretical framework consists of two different approaches to consultation: the directive and the non-directive approach. The approaches differ regarding particular emphasis on advice and reflection during the consultation and with respect to who or what should be the focus of the consultation. The two approaches are here studied through various theories such as social learning theory, Bruner's theory of scaffolding, Roger’s humanist psychology, and constructivism. Semi-structured interviews were held with eighteen special education teachers (n= 9) and class teachers (n= 9) working in the compulsory school. The overall interpretation of the results shows that <b>special</b> education <b>consultation</b> can be understood as three different types of consultation. Consultation as counseling which harmonizes with the directive perspective on consultation is the most prominent type. In the consultation as counseling conversation, the special educational knowledge transfer is central and the focus is placed on the pupil. Although special education knowledge transfer emerges as a unique aspect of <b>special</b> education <b>consultation,</b> there are several inherent challenges in this type of consultation that can be addressed in that teachers also describe two other types of consultation. In the reflective consultation, there is a move away from the pupil focus and toward a focus on the class teacher and the use of reflection. The reflective consultation harmonizes with the non-directive approach to consultation. This type of consultation does not as of yet have a prominent place in the Finland-Swedish school context and at this stage it is not seen as a legitimate type of consultation according to the teachers’ descriptions. Despite this, certain aspects of the reflective conversation could be given more space in the development of <b>consultation</b> within <b>special</b> educational contexts. The co-operative consultation is characterized by the teachers acting as teammates and using professional exchange as a strategy for consultation. Both teachers' knowledge is seen as central, and rather than the special education teacher acting as the expert and moderator, the teachers control the consultation together and jointly move the work along. The co-operative consultation enables the focus to move from the pupil toward the context, which can lead to the development of inclusive practices. The results indicate that this type of consultation holds potential in the development of <b>special</b> educational <b>consultation</b> that takes place between equal colleagues. The co-operative consultation opens up for a third collaborative approach to consultation, where aspects of the directive and non-directive perspective can merge and develop. The thesis concludes with the proposal that <b>special</b> pedagogical <b>consultation</b> can be understood from an integrated perspective. The characteristics of the consultation can vary {{depending on the type of}} problem or situation, while co-operative consultation can be seen as the ideal as equal colleagues meet in consultation conversations. In order to develop the co-operative consultation, both teachers are required to have knowledge of consultation as a practice, to be part of a collaborative school climate, and that teachers are provided with enough time to take part in consultations...|$|R

Material and methods. 342 pts (317 female, 25 male, mean age 61, 4 ± 8, 9 years) required a <b>special</b> <b>consultation</b> for osteoporosis were asked to fill a questionnaire. All answered questions concerning social, demographic, medical data, assessment of pt knowledge about OP, quality of life assessment with QALY score. To assess pts willingness to pay for OP treatment {{they were asked to}} determine sum of money they were ready to pay for an appropriate drug decreasing fracture risk in two times. The pt was to consider 4 scenarios: low, small, moderate and high fracture risk during subsequent life. Results. 86 % of pts were ready to pay for OP treatment. The main factors associated with absence of such willingness were older age (OR= 1, 06, 95 % confidence interval 1,о 2 - 1, 1), invalidity (OR= 3, 18, 95 % confidence interval 1, 54 - 6, 60), loneliness (OR= 2, 4 (), 95 % confidence interval 1, 27 - 4, 50). These pts were also worse informed about the disease. But family income did not influence the decision to pay. Number of pts ready to pay for the treatment and sum which they were ready to pay directly depended on the probability of fracture (rank test r= 0, 99 and r= 0, 28 respectively). The most powerful factor determining the sum pt was ready to pay for the treatment was family income. Next on importance were presence of the work and families consisted of 3 or more members. Personal experience of the pt in treatment with such drugs also had some significance. So pts treated with miacalcic were ready to pay significantly larger sums than other pts with equivalent incomes. Conclusion. Pts willingness to pay for OP treatment depends firstly on social factors and his knowledge about OP. The main factor determining the sum the pt is ready to pay is family income. On the whole sums the pts are ready to pay are significantly less than market price of drugs with proved efficacy. Fracture risk value determined by bone densitometry is an important factor influencing decision to pay for OP treatment...|$|R
