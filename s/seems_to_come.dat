5|$|Linguistically, {{the text}} of Rawlinson B 512 is similar to Harley 5280, {{especially}} at the beginning; {{and there are also}} innovations in common with the Book of Leinster, showing that the redactor clearly had more than one manuscript at his disposal. In one instance the diction <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> closer to the form of the original than any other surviving manuscript. An interpolation concerning Cú Roí points to this version's origin in Munster. In spite of some miscomprehension of the story {{on the part of the}} revisionist scribe, the literary style as a whole is somewhat smoother than in the earlier version, which Rudolf Thurneysen points out is of help for the understanding of the tale.|$|E
25|$|Most modern domes {{are built}} from thin {{aluminium}} sections with ribs providing a supporting structure behind. The use of aluminium {{makes it easy}} to perforate the dome with thousands of tiny holes. This reduces the reflectivity of sound back to the audience (providing better acoustic characteristics), lets a sound system project through the dome from behind (offering sound that <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from appropriate directions related to a show), and allows air circulation through the projection surface for climate control.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{when the}} family name reform was {{introduced}} in the mid-19th century, the default was to use a patronym, or a matronym when the father was dead or unknown. The typical derivation was to append the suffix -escu to the father's name, e.g. Anghelescu ("Anghel's child") and Petrescu ("Petre's child"). (The -escu <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from Latin -iscum, thus being cognate with Italian -esco and French -esque.) The other common derivation was to append the suffix -eanu to the name of the place of origin, especially when one came from a different region, e.g. Munteanu ("from the mountains") and Moldoveanu ("from Moldova"). These uniquely Romanian suffixes strongly identify ancestral nationality.|$|E
2500|$|In these {{final three}} discourses {{of his first}} authorship he chooses to write about Confession before God about guilt, sin, forgiveness, {{marriage}} and death and the answers that <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> or don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the inquiring individual.|$|R

25|$|Another word, divvie or divvy ("idiot"), <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{from the}} Co-op dividend, {{or from the}} two Davy lamps (the more {{explosive}} Scotch Davy used in 1850, commission disapproved of its use in 1886 (inventor not known, nicknamed Scotch Davy probably given by miners after the Davy lamp was made perhaps by north east miners who used the Stephenson Lamp), and the later better designed Davy designed by Humphry Davy also called the Divvy.) As in a north east miner saying 'Marra, ye keep way from me if ye usin a divvy.' It seems the word divvie then translated to daft lad/lass. Perhaps coming from the fact one {{would be seen as}} foolish going down a mine with a Scotch Divvy when there are safer lamps available, like the Geordie, or the Davy.|$|E
25|$|Instead of from life, the {{character}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from literature, for {{his name is}} reminiscent of Oroondates, a character in La Calprenède's Cassandra, which Behn had read. Oroondates is a prince of Scythia whose desired bride is snatched away by an elder king. Previous to this, there is an Oroondates who is the satrap of Memphis in the Æthiopica, a novel from late antiquity by Heliodorus of Emesa. Many of the plot elements in Behn's novel are reminiscent {{of those in the}} Æthiopica and other Greek romances of the period. There is a particular similarity to the story of Juba in La Calprenède's romance Cléopâtre, who becomes a slave in Rome and is given a Roman name—Coriolanus—by his captors, as Oroonoko is given the Roman name of Caesar.|$|E
25|$|In the Underworld, {{the clock}} hand ticks again, {{signifying}} that yet another soul had moved on, while Hades {{reflects on the}} page depicting him with Zelena. At this point, 12 souls had moved on from the Underworld (since the clock in the Underworld had shifted from 8:15 to 8:27). Inside Hades' lair, Hades is furious that Gold is taking his time to create a portal to Storybrooke in order to transport Zelena’s baby daughter to him, telling him {{that the success of}} this plan will be the difference in whether or not Gold's secrets are revealed to Belle and if Gold's debt to Hades will be cancelled, unless he finishes the job quickly. Meanwhile, Snow and David discover that they can use a special phone to contact their son Neal through the process of haunting. At the loft, Henry is still feeling less useful even as he shows them illustrated drawings that <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to him but can't explain it.|$|E

500|$|As {{the title}} of the work suggests, the main theme of the novel deals with Henry Fleming's attempt to prove himself a worthy soldier by earning his [...] "red badge of courage". The first twelve chapters, until he {{receives}} his accidental wound, expose his cowardice. The following chapters detail his growth and apparently resulting heroism. Before the onset of battle, the novel's protagonist romanticized war; what little he knew about battle he learned from books: [...] "He had read of marches, sieges, conflicts, and he had longed to see it all". Therefore, when confronted by the harsh realities of war, Henry is shocked, and his idealism falters. Finding solace in existential thoughts, he internally fights {{to make sense of the}} senseless world in which he finds himself. When he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to terms with his situation, he is yet again forced into the fears of battle, which threaten to strip him of his enlightened identity. Joseph Hergesheimer wrote in his introduction to the 1925 Knopf edition of the novel that, at its heart, The Red Badge of Courage was a [...] "story of the birth, in a boy, of a knowledge of himself and of self-command." ...|$|E
500|$|Following its broadcast, [...] "Treehouse of Horror X" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. In {{his review of}} The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote [...] "Even in the series’ crummier seasons, the staff always <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{up with a good}} Halloween episode", and that [...] "Treehouse of Horror X" [...] "continues that trend". Of the three segments, Jacobson found [...] "Life's a Glitch, Then You Die" [...] to be the weakest. He wrote [...] " [...] other than a good ending, it simply doesn’t have a lot going for it" [...] and added that it is the most dated of the three. He continued, [...] "'Diddily' offers a fun horror spoof, and 'Xena' is a terrific superhero bit with plenty of cleverness." [...] DVD Talk's Ian Jane gave the episode a positive review as well. Considering it {{to be one of the}} season's best episodes, Jane wrote [...] "This one, like so many that have come before and since, is a great blend of horror movie parody and Halloween themed fun in Springfield." [...] In 2007, Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal included [...] "Desperately Xeeking Xena" [...] in a list called [...] "The Ten Best Treehouse of Horror Vignettes". Although he disliked Bart and Lisa's part in the segment, Patrick wrote that it [...] "earns its stripes by being perhaps Comic Book Guy's finest hour". He also praised the segment's references, as well as Lawless' line [...] "A wizard did it", a phrase used to explain continuity errors. In 2009, The Collector's marriage proposal to Lawless was included in [...] "Line-O-Rama: Comic Book Guy", a compilation of what IGN considers to be The Comic Book Guy's best lines.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "constellation" [...] <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{from the}} Late Latin term , {{which can be}} {{translated}} as [...] "set of stars", and came into use in English during the 14th century.|$|E

2500|$|When the Stamp Act created {{controversy}} {{throughout the}} colonies, Richard Bland thought {{through the entire}} issue of parliamentary laws {{as opposed to those}} that originated in the colonial assemblies. While others, particularly James Otis, get more credit for the idea of [...] "no taxation without representation", the full argument for this position <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from Bland. In early 1766, he wrote An Inquiry into the Rights of the British Colonies. It was published in Williamsburg and reprinted in England.|$|E
2500|$|The {{association}} of Elias with mountaintops <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{from a different}} pagan tradition: Elias took on the attributes and the locales associated with Zeus, especially his associations with mountains and his powers over rain, thunder, lighting, and wind. When Elias prevailed over the priests of Baal, it was on Mount Carmel (...) , which later became known as Mount St. Elias. When he spent forty days in a cave, it was on Mount Horeb (...) [...] When Elias confronted Ahab, he stopped the rains for three years (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|In the Summa Theologica, Saint Thomas Aquinas {{stated that}} [...] "the unnatural vice" [...] is the {{greatest}} of the sins of lust. In his Summa contra Gentiles, traditionally dated to 1264, he argued against what he called [...] "the error of {{those who say that}} there is no more sin in the emission of the semen than in the ejection of other superfluous products from the body" [...] by saying that, after murder, which destroys an existing human being, disordinate emission of semen to the preclusion of generating a human being <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> second.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding Callas's soft singing, Celletti says, [...] "In these soft passages, Callas <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{use another}} voice altogether, because it {{acquired}} a great sweetness. Whether in her florid singing or in her canto spianato, that is, in long held notes without ornamentation, her mezza-voce could achieve such moving sweetness {{that the sound}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from on high... I don't know, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from the skylight of La Scala." ...|$|R

2500|$|Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz gave a {{positive}} assessment for Phineas and Ferb in their 2016 book titled TV (The Book), stating that [...] "In television, formula often <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{from a lack}} of imagination.... Phineas and Ferb though, managed {{at the same time to}} be wildly imaginative and slavishly formulaic, using its repetitive structure not as a crutch, but as a sturdy framework on which it could hang all kinds of fantastic new ideas." [...] They further added that [...] "the characters' awareness of that formula, and any deviations from it, quickly became one of the show's most fertile sources of humor." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the braying contest that follows, {{there is}} a noise that <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> [...] "from the deep Divine;/ There Webster! peal'd thy voice, and Whitfield! thine" [...] (B II 257–8). [...] Webster was a radical Protestant {{religious}} writer who had demanded the scourging of the church, and Whitfield was George Whitfield, the notable collaborator with John Wesley, whom Pope describes as [...] "a Field-preacher[...] [...] thought {{the only means of}} advancing Christianity was by [...] [...] [...] the old death of fire and faggot" [...] who agreed with Webster only [...] "to abuse all the sober Clergy" [...] (note to line 258). Richard Blackmore appears again as the single singer with the loudest [...] "bray." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{have also}} pointed out that the show lacks visual punch. People interviewed in the show declare that they [...] "feel" [...] a spirit next to them, but nothing is shown to the TV viewer. In the series debut, the {{audience}} is told that a young boy sees ghosts, but the audience is not able to see any evidence of this. [...] "The most compelling footage <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> more from the editing room than beyond the grave", noted one industry trade publication. Reviewers say the show also fails to effectively integrate and utilize the team's (apparently) sophisticated audio and video equipment to heighten tension or help support their claims of paranormal activity.|$|E

2500|$|The Medici {{family were}} {{effective}} rulers of Florence, which was nominally a republic, throughout Botticelli's lifetime up to 1494, when the main branch were expelled. [...] Lorenzo il Magnifico became {{the head of}} the family in 1469, just around the time Botticelli started his own workshop. [...] He was a great patron of both the visual and literary arts, and encouraged and financed the humanist and Neoplatonist circle from which much of the character of Botticelli's mythological painting <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> [...] In general Lorenzo {{does not seem to have}} commissioned much from Botticelli, preferring Pollaiuolo and others, although views on this differ. [...] A Botticello who was probably Sandro's brother Giovanni was close to Lorenzo.|$|E
2500|$|The Wrestler has {{received}} much critical acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 98% of critics gave the film positive write-ups {{based upon a}} sample of 222, {{and gave it a}} Golden Tomato for best drama of 2008. The critical consensus states that [...] "Mickey Rourke gives a performance for the ages in The Wrestler, a richly affecting, heart-wrenching yet ultimately rewarding drama." [...] At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film {{has received}} an average score of 81, based on 36 reviews, signifying [...] "universal acclaim". Alonso Duralde, of MSNBC, said, [...] "Rourke's work transcends mere stunt-casting; his performance is a howl of pain that <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from a very real place." ...|$|E
2500|$|The root {{word for}} [...] "stoat" [...] is likely either the Dutch word stout ("naughty") or the Gothic word stautan ("to push"). According to John Guillim, in his Display of Heraldrie, the word [...] "ermine" [...] is likely derived from Armenia, the nation {{where it was}} thought the species originated, though other authors have linked it to the Norman French from the Teutonic harmin (Anglo-Saxon hearma). This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from the Lithuanian word šarmu. In Ireland (where the least weasel does not occur), the stoat is {{referred}} to as a weasel, while in North America it is called a short-tailed weasel. A male stoat is called a dog, hob or jack, while a female is called a bitch or jill. The collective noun for stoats is either gang or pack.|$|E
