5|$|In the B story, April (Aubrey Plaza) {{is working}} as Chris' (Rob Lowe) {{assistant}} until {{he goes back}} to Indianapolis. April's cynical personality clashes with Chris' relentless optimism and happiness. In an attempt to get fired, April purposely neglects to tell Ann (Rashida Jones) that Chris cannot make a lunch date. When Ann arrives to confront Chris, she quickly realizes April's ploy. Ann reveals she is very happy dating Chris, and would even probably move with him to Indianapolis if asked. Andy (Chris Pratt), who is still trying to win back April's affections, gives Chris an obviously forged letter from the FBI claiming April must immediately return to the parks department. Chris sees through the ruse and tells April <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> back, but that remaining his assistant may provide her career opportunities. He invites her to return with him to Indianapolis and she seems interested, leaving both Ann and Andy stunned and jealous.|$|E
5|$|The {{money that}} Callum won from the casino is missing, and Samantha finds it with Jenny {{and her husband}} Dean (Tom Pelphrey), after they stole it. Jenny and Dean are brought into {{question}}ing; however Jenny tells Megan that Callum was giving it to her, to go on an art course. Samantha talks to Frank again, but when they question him about Irina {{but he does not}} know her. They find out that Irina was Callum's nurse, for his arthritis and that Callum was going to help Irina get her son from Belgrade to the US. Irina confesses that she did cut up Callum, but did not kill him. Irina found Callum dead, so cut him up so that she could forge the last immigration document to get her son to her as Callum had not finished it. Irina tells Megan where the head is, and they find a fracture on his head. Megan and Samantha go back to Callum’s apartment, and Megan demonstrates why Irina couldn’t have killed Callum due to the mark on the wall being too high to be Irina. Megan traces metal to Callum's landlord, Mike Walsh (Kelly AuCoin). Samantha infers that because Cal was under rent control, Mike killed him so a paying client could stay in the apartment. Meanwhile, Lacey Fleming (Mary Mouser) asks if <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> to Megan's work, for a school project. Lacey arrives, and speaks with Dr. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), discussing her work. Lacey tries to get Kate to allow her to see the body, however she refuses.

With this power, she can float in the wind in some stages. She can also use it to break open flying bags that contain mostly coins and {{sometimes}} hearts and vibe crystals, splash bits of Blooper's ink thrown in the air, spin Kamek's head and slow down her falls as an easy use. However, some areas feature spores that stop her flying abilities, requiring more traditional platform methods to reach, but <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> up platforms that are vertically close.|$|E

500|$|The {{model for}} the {{preliminary}} illustrations of Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was Potter's own pet hedgehog. [...] Potter wrote to Warne on 12 November, [...] "Mrs. Tiggy as a model is comical; so long as <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> to sleep on my knee she is delighted, but if she is propped up on end for half an hour, she first begins to yawn pathetically, and then she does bite!

Underwood's voice spans from the low note of A3 to the high note of C5. Billy Dukes of Taste of Country noted that the lyrics of the song push [...] "the {{normally}} plucky country superstar to the edge of evil. It's as far as <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> without falling off the cliff of believability." [...] Dukes also described the song as a [...] "mini-movie", in which Underwood sings: [...] "And the preacher said {{he was a good man}} / And his brother said he was a good friend / But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry / Bye, bye / Yeah they took turns laying a rose down / Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground / He's not the only one who had a secret to hide / Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye."

500|$|Though {{a modern}} {{synopsis}} {{has not been}} published, the original synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World on December 3, 1910. It states: [...] "Captain Smith sails away on his vessel for a trip around South America, through the Pacific, leaving behind him his wife and little girl, whom he dearly loves. The ship is reported lost with all on board, {{with the exception of}} a cabin boy who is picked up in mid ocean. The captain's wife struggles to support her child, but owing to a rapidly failing health she fights a losing battle with poverty. One by one her valued possessions find their way to the pawnshop, where the kind-hearted old pawnbroker, Levy, becomes interested in the sad-faced woman and pretty child, who never seem able to redeem any of their possessions. The last article of value left in Mrs. Smith's possession is her wedding ring, and Levy refuses to take this. Instead he offers her help, which the widow proudly refuses. She insists that <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> out and get work. Levy, seeing that he can help in no other way, offers to care for little Marie, and to this the mother finally gives her consent. Half in jest, Levy gives the mother a pawn ticket for the little girl, which he fills out to read that 'a precious jewel, a value beyond price,' has been left with him and can be redeemed 'at any time.' The mother leaves the little one in Levy's care and upon reaching home and finding herself mortally stricken, she puts the pawn ticket he has given her in an envelope which she entrusts to a friendly janitoress, to be given into no other hands than those of her husband should it be that he is not dead.|$|E
