Chiswick Town Hall, a dark building in London, was also used as a shooting location.

Ham House, Richmond, was used for filming mostly exterior scenes at Hailsham School and a couple of interior scenes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{much earlier}} Puranic {{character}} associated with Kerala is Mahabali, an Asura and a prototypical just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He {{won the war}} against the Devas, driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu, who took his fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to Patala (the netherworld) to placate the Devas. There is a belief that, once a year during the Onam festival, Mahabali returns to Kerala. The Matsya Purana, among the oldest of the 18 Puranas, uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala (and Tamil Nadu) as the <b>setting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> story of Matsya, the first incarnation of Vishnu, and Manu, the first man and the king of the region.|$|E
40|$|A {{dominating}} <b>set</b> <b>for</b> {{a location}} {{problem is a}} set of points that contains an opti-mal solution for all instances of the problem. The p-facility location problems on a network appear when <b>the</b> possible selections <b>for</b> locating <b>the</b> facilities are the sets of p points of the network. Hooker, Garfinkel and Chen [4] consider a theoretical result to extend <b>the</b> dominating <b>set</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1 -facility problems to the corresponding p-facility problems, and apply this result to propose a finite dominating <b>set</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> p-facility cent-dian problem on a network. The optimal solutions of the cent-dian problems are those minimizing a linear combination of the center and median ob-jective functions. Since it is known that the set of vertices and local centers is a dominating <b>set</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> single facility cent-dian problem, they claim that it is also a dominating <b>set</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> p-facility cent-dian problem. We show a counterexample for p = 2 and give an alternative finite dominating <b>set</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> p-facility cent-dian. We also provide a solution method that avoids the exhaustive search in all the sets of p points of this dominating set...|$|R

5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{takes place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of the Castlevania series. The series' premise is the conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Thirty-six years before the start of Aria of Sorrow, Dracula was defeated once and for all by the Belmont clan, and his powers sealed into a solar eclipse. Shortly after Dracula's death, a prophecy was made that Dracula's reincarnation would come to his castle in 2035 and inherit all of Dracula's powers. This prophecy acts as {{the driving force behind the}} plot of Aria of Sorrow, and is the primary motivation of the supporting characters to be present. The game {{takes place in}} Dracula's castle, the most common <b>setting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> series, with the castle divided into numerous areas that the player traverses over the course of the game.|$|E
5|$|Barry Took, who had {{produced}} {{a series of}} ultimately unsuccessful documentaries for the BBC about working men's clubs, was partially responsible for the choice of location for the exterior shots. The programme which drew the highest ratings of the series focused on Burnlee Working Men's Club, a club in the small West Yorkshire town of Holmfirth and Took saw Holmfirth's potential as the backdrop of a television show. Took's idea was passed to James Gilbert and Roy Clarke via Duncan Wood, who {{was at that time}} filming Comedy Playhouse. Gilbert and Clarke then travelled to Holmfirth and decided to use it as the <b>setting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pilot of Last of the Summer Wine.|$|E
