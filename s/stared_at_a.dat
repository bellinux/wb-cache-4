25|$|It is also {{believed}} that on June 12, 1892, Antonio Vélez Alvarado was at his apartment at 219 Twenty-Third Street in Manhattan, when he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Cuban flag for a few minutes, and then {{took a look at}} the blank wall in which it was being displayed. Vélez suddenly perceived an optical illusion, in which he perceived the image of the Cuban flag with the colors in the flag's triangle and stripes inverted. Almost immediately he visited a nearby merchant, Domingo Peraza, from whom he bought some crepe paper to build a crude prototype. He later displayed his prototype in a dinner meeting at his neighbor's house, where the owner, Micaela Dalmau vda. de Carreras, had invited José Martí as a guest.|$|E

500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} [...] "B–" [...] and {{concluded}} that, [...] "I did jump a few times, and I liked Haley's dour malevolence, but overall, the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by-the-numbers bad dream that plays {{a little too much}} like a corporately ordered rerun. One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, we've been there before". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the acting calling it [...] "lethargically lifeless" [...] and criticized Haley's portrayal of Krueger, saying, [...] "Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory, there's just no replacing Englund". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 star out of 4, writing in his review, [...] "I <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>A</b> Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what? Are we supposed to be scared? Is the sudden clanging chord supposed to evoke a fearful Pavlovian response?".|$|E

2500|$|According {{to other}} {{accounts}} on June 12, 1892, disputed by scholar Armando Martí, Antonio Vélez Alvarado {{was at his}} apartment at 219 Twenty-Third Street in Manhattan, when he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Cuban flag for a few minutes, and then {{took a look at}} the blank wall in which it was being displayed.

Acceptance of the prototype was slow in coming, but grew with time. Francisco Gonzalo Marín, who decided to have a proper flag sewn based on the prototype, presented the new flag's design in New York's [...] "Chimney Corner Hall" [...] a gathering place of independence advocates two years later. The Puerto Rican Flag (with the light blue triangle) soon came to symbolize the ideals of the Puerto Rican independence movement.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara helped {{explain why}} (as [...] reports) God chose a rainbow as {{the symbol of}} God's promise. The Mishnah taught with regard to those who take no thought for the honor of their Maker, {{that it would have}} been better if they had not been born. Rabbi Abba read this Mishnah to refer to those who <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rainbow, while Rav Joseph said that it refers to those who commit transgressions in secret. The Gemara {{explained}} that those who <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rainbow affront God's honor, as [...] compares God's appearance to that of a rainbow: [...] "As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord." [...] Thus those who <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rainbow behave as if they were staring directly at God. Similarly, Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Nahmani, the speaker for Resh Lakish, taught that because [...] compares God's appearance to that of <b>a</b> rainbow, staring <b>at</b> the rainbow harms one's eyesight.|$|R
60|$|Joe sat up. He gave a long, {{sideways}} {{look at the}} corporal. Then {{he lifted}} his eyes and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> crack in the ceiling.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the warm}} visage of Bumpus elongated, {{and his eyes}} opened uncommonly wide as he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> {{particular}} spot in the ground; insomuch that Corrie burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.|$|E

6000|$|His conduct, {{under the}} circumstances, was so utterly inconceivable, that I stood bewildered {{with my hand}} in his. It {{is a piece of}} rudeness to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> anybody, and it is an act of indelicacy to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> gentleman. I {{committed}} both those improprieties. And I said, as if in a dream, [...] "What does it mean?" ...|$|R
60|$|The Rector, who had {{resumed his}} seat, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> little gold cross {{which he had}} taken out of his {{waistcoat}} pocket. Mr. Paramor lifted a vase and sniffed at the rose it contained; Gregory walked to the window.|$|E
60|$|When Joseph P. {{sat down}} to that table he stopped looking bored. All the time the {{minister}} was saying grace that man simply <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> big plate of doughnuts near my end of the table, as if he'd {{never seen anything like}} them before.|$|E
60|$|Seated on a chair, {{with his}} elbows on his knees, his chin in his hands, and his nails between his teeth, he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> corner of the room, nibbled and meditated. There was nothing {{peculiar}} about {{the corner of the}} room at which he stared, save that there stood in it a portmanteau which Sam had bought the day before, and in which were locked his and Robin's bags of treasure.|$|E
60|$|The Duke <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him <b>a</b> moment, with startled countenance {{and mouth}} agape.|$|R
60|$|Here Augusta interposed, fearing least her admirer--for with an unerring instinct, she now guessed how matters stood--should say {{something}} foolish.

60|$|Dennis stood {{trembling}} {{with his back}} against the door, and involuntarily raising his arm to defend himself, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> man, the only other tenant of the cell, who lay, stretched at his fall length, upon a stone bench, and who paused in his deep breathing as if he were about to wake. But he rolled over on one side, let his arm fall negligently down, drew a long sigh, and murmuring indistinctly, fell fast asleep again.|$|E
60|$|Mike {{remained}} stonily silent. The {{rather large}} grain {{of truth in}} what Firby-Smith had said had gone home, as the unpleasant truth about ourselves is apt to do; and his feelings were hurt. He {{was determined not to}} give in and say that he saw even if the head of the house invoked all the majesty of the prefects' room to help him, as he had nearly done once before. He set his teeth, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> photograph on the wall.|$|E
60|$|Trot {{dreamed that}} she was at home in her own bed, but the night seemed chilly {{and she wanted to}} draw the coverlet up to her chin. She was not wide awake, but {{realized}} {{that she was}} cold and unable to move her arms to cover herself up. She tried, but could not stir. Then she roused herself a little more and tried again. Yes, it was cold, very cold! Really, she MUST do something to get warm, she thought. She opened her eyes and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> great wall of ice in front of her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, child, you won't do {{anything}} of the sort. Ma hasn't got a bit of kick coming. You've always been awful nice, far as I can see." [...] She smiled lavishly. [...] "I {{went for a walk}} to-night.... I wish all those men wouldn't <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> girl so. I'm sure I don't see why they should <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> me." ...|$|R
60|$|The girl <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him <b>a</b> moment, {{and then}} he saw only sympathy in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|James <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him <b>an</b> instant, {{and then}} {{suddenly}} collapsed and fell back inert upon the bed.|$|R
60|$|The {{change in}} the man was so startling, his muttered exclamation--so natural that its profanity never even grated. His eyes seemed to be {{starting}} out of his head, his lips were drawn back from his teeth. Blank, unutterable surprise held him, dumb and spellbound, as he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> half-sheet of type written notepaper. She herself, amazed at his transformed appearance, found words for the moment impossible. Then a queer change came into his expression. His eyebrows drew closer together, his lips turned malevolently. He pushed the paper underneath a pile of others and turned his head towards her. Their eyes met. There was something like fear in his.|$|E
6000|$|... "It wouldn't be you either. I suppose that's {{the gist}} of the whole thing." [...] He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> little eddy. [...] "The rule's all right, so long as there isn't a case. Rules are for {{established}} things, like the pieces and positions of a game. Men and women are not established things; they're experiments, all of them. Every human being is a new thing, exists to do new things. Find the {{thing you want to do}} most intensely, make sure that's it, and do it with all your might. If you live, well and good; if you die, well and good. Your purpose is done.... Well, this is OUR thing." ...|$|E
60|$|The Arabs were firing {{their rifles}} as a welcome to their friends, {{and the others}} as they trotted their camels across the open {{returned}} the salutes and waved their rifles and lances in the air. They were a smaller band than the first one,--not more than thirty,--but dressed in the same red head-gear and patched jibbehs. One of them carried a small white banner with a scarlet text scrawled across it. But there was something there which drew the eyes and the thoughts of the tourists away from everything else. The same fear gripped at each of their hearts, and the same impulse kept each of them silent. They <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> swaying white figure half seen amidst {{the ranks of the}} desert warriors.|$|E
50|$|According to this theory, color {{blindness}} {{is due to}} {{the lack}} of a particular chemical in the eye.
