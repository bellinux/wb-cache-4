40|$|<b>Sterilization</b> <b>by</b> heat {{cannot be}} used when it is {{necessary}} to preserve heatlabile substances. <b>Sterilization</b> <b>by</b> bacterial filtration fails when materials are used which plug the filter, when critical constituents are adsorbed onto the filter, or when elements which should be removed pass through the filter (filterable viruses). Most chemical sterilizing agents, such as the phenols, the heavy metal salts, and the detergents, are persistent in their effect and materials treated with them are permanently rendered incapable of supporting bacterial growth. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the use of ethylene oxide as an alternative to <b>sterilization</b> <b>by</b> heat and filtration. Media to which the proper proportions of ethylene oxide have been added are temporarily bactericidal, but the action of the chemical is of short duration, the media regaining in a few hours their ability to grow bacteria.

It is an electric, thermosensitive equipment, not indicated for surgical use, which has not been previously evaluated regarding the sterilization efficacy, being suspect of infection risk. This study evaluated the efficacy of <b>sterilization</b> <b>by</b> ethylene oxide (EtO) of new drills that were intentionally contaminated with Bacillus atrophaeus spores. An experimental, laboratory, randomized applied research was developed, where 16 electric drills were analyzed, in addition to positive and negative controls. All the previously cleaned and sterilized equipment were submitted to contamination by spores. The experimental group was submitted to cleaning and <b>sterilization</b> <b>by</b> EtO and test of sterility by filtration through a 0. 45 µm membrane. The membranes were cultivated and Gram and Wirtz-Conklin staining were carried out in positive results for spore visualization. An efficacy of 99. 99999881 % of the process of <b>sterilization</b> <b>by</b> EtO was confirmed, with a probability of survival of 1. 19 x 10 - 8.

Roughness level {{and the nature of}} the abrasive particles of shot blasting influence energetically the samples; increasing the hydrophobic behaviour with the increase of the surface roughness and the alumina use. The contamination due to steam autoclaving hydrophobizes the surface; contrary to <b>sterilization</b> <b>by</b> ethylene oxide, which reduces the contact angle value. The modification of treated surfaces was examined with a series of surface analytical techniques that include the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the white light interferometer microscopy and the static contact angle measurement in order to determine a qualitative and quantitative topographic characterization and an energetic characterization. status: publishe...|$|R
