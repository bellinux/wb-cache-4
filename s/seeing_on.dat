In the case of Atlantis, Howard chose an Indonesian orchestral sound incorporating chimes, bells, and gongs. The directors told Howard that the film would {{have a number of}} key scenes without dialogue; the score would need to convey emotionally what the viewer was <b>seeing</b> <b>on</b> screen.|$|E
25|$|Davydova {{was born}} in Voronezh, 500 {{kilometres}} south of Moscow. She became interested in gymnastics at age six after <b>seeing</b> <b>on</b> television the famous Soviet Olympic gold medallists Larisa Petrik and Natalia Kuchinskaya. She practicised the splits {{to see if she}} also could do them. Deciding {{she wanted to be a}} gymnast Elena went by herself to be enrolled in Voronezh's famous Spartak Gymnastics school, yet was turned away, as she was very small, and considered at the time to have the wrong physique for the sport."They would call me Kolobok after the little fairytale pancake". Rather than giving up however, she secretly watched the lessons through windows and tried to imitate in the schoolyard what she had observed."My Mom wanted me to do Piano and I would run away from it to do gymnastics".|$|E

[...] Booker has himself been the target of rumors about being gay and has generally refused to address these on principle, which he explained in 2013: Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia.

500|$|McNulty {{expressed}} joy in how {{the viewer}} of the Boruto anime gets to see Boruto's days in the ninja academy which Naruto briefly showed and how Boruto {{does not have the}} same behavior as his father when being a child. While noting that Boruto has still to fight enemies possessed by [...] "shadows" [...] in the anime, Anime Now writer Sarah Nelkin found this more lighthearted than Naruto's actions in the first series such as his final fight against Sasuke Uchiha where both became friends after nearly killing each other. Upon the build up of the anime's first story arc, McNulty praised the fight between Boruto, Mitsuki and Sumire was praised for its animation with the reviewer also noting how Boruto inherited his father's ways of <b>seeing</b> <b>on</b> the good parts of his enemies in order to avoid violence. Viz Media senior director Kevin Hamric referred to Boruto described his differences with his father such as his lack of desire to become the village's leader and instead do other activities like playing video games. However, Hamric said he initially has the desire to surpass his father.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{noted the}} {{similarities}} between the Iraqi boys and those from Western cultures. Peter Scarlet, the artistic director at the Tribeca Film Festival, said, [...] "What's fascinating about the film that resulted is how very familiar and ordinary these kids are – they're not really all that different from your own teenagers or the kids you went to school with. The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been <b>seeing</b> <b>on</b> the nightly news for five years." [...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first round}} was a [...] "never have I ever" [...] round, {{in which the}} {{participants}} had to admit to experiences {{they had never been}} involved in. If the opponent had partaken in a similar action he was forced to drink a shot. Storm was the victor of this round. The second round was contested with both participants having beer bottles taped to their hands and neither being allowed to go to the bathroom. Young won after Storm wet himself, which was confirmed by Ms. Jackie, now named Jackie Moore. The third round involved the two drinking shots; it was won by Storm after Young passed out because Storm had drugged him. With Storm winning two contests to one, he earned the ability to determine their match at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008. At Against All Odds, Young defeated Storm to retain the TNA World Beer Drinking Championship after Rhino interfered attacking Storm. On the February 28, 2008 episode of Impact!, a Ladder match for the World Beer Drinking Championship was held between Storm and Young. Storm won the bout after Moore climbed a ladder and retrieved the championship for Storm without the referee <b>seeing.</b> <b>On</b> the March 6, 2008 episode of Impact!, Rhino stole the title belt from Storm and bashed the belt across a ring post, thus destroying it and ending the storyline surrounding it.|$|E
500|$|Five {{different}} people {{were involved in}} the creation of the film's story and script: executive producer Bob Thompson, original Bionicle co-creators and writers Alastair Swinnerton and Martin Riber Andersen, and Hollywood writers Henry Gilroy and Greg Weisman. The script-writing process began in 2002. Gilroy became involved after a meeting with Thompson, and enjoyed working on the script as he greatly admired the Bionicle mythos. Two draft scripts were originally created to see who would write the better script: one by Swinnerton, and one from Gilroy. Due to time constraints, the Gilroy script was accepted with some of Swinnerton's ideas included. Gilroy's most difficult task was creating the dialogue for the Toa: he needed to take into account Thompson's own interpretations, and what the majority of fans thought they should sounds like. In the end, he attempted to stay true to original portrayals while giving the voice actors something unique to work with. He also needed to balance their portrayals and screentime, as each of the six needed a chance to shine. The script went through eight different drafts before the final version, although this was far less than Gilroy was used to <b>seeing</b> <b>on</b> other projects. During planning stages, a lot of time was devoted to how characters interacted with each other: cited examples were Lewa's style of speaking, and Kopaka's stoic behaviour. These traits were accentuated for the film to give the characters more distinction and depth. He also needed to avoid putting in out-of-context pop culture references, which would not fit into the setting of Bionicle. As part of the world and character development, expressions and exclamations unique to the world were created: a cited example is Jaller saying [...] "You could have been Lava-Bones" [...] when Takua narrowly escapes being killed by a flood of lava.|$|E
500|$|Howe {{was opposed}} in his riding by CCF {{candidate}} Doug Fisher, a {{local high school}} teacher. Fisher's campaign was well financed, with support from his party, the unions, {{and a number of}} corporate enemies Howe had made over the years. Fisher was able to buy up the key time on the local television station—Howe initially scheduled no television appearances. The voters of Port Arthur saw Fisher on television every night, explaining why the Liberals had gone wrong in his view, and what his party proposed to do to correct matters. Called back to his riding after the remainder of his disastrous Prairie tour was canceled, Howe found that Fisher's appeals had caused defections among Liberals. Howe managed to get TV time just before the election and according to Bothwell and Kilbourn [...] "treated his viewers to the sight of a tired, harsh old man, telling them that the nice young fellow that they had been <b>seeing</b> <b>on</b> television {{for the last couple of}} months was, if not a communist himself, then associated with the communists. No one believed him." [...] Fisher defeated Howe by over a thousand votes. Howe was gracious in defeat, shaking Fisher's hand at the television station, and assuring the member-elect's mother, long a Howe admirer, that there were many things for him to do. [...] Howe's defeat came as the Liberals still led narrowly in the reported returns. The Tories forged ahead, and took the greater number of seats, 112 to 105. [...] St. Laurent could have remained in office until Diefenbaker and the Tories defeated him in the House, but chose not to—a course with which Howe agreed. The Liberals left office on 21 June 1957, with Howe the only remaining minister of those sworn in with Mackenzie King in 1935.|$|E

2500|$|After the Iraq invasion, U.S. {{troops were}} {{criticized for not}} {{protecting}} the historical artifacts and treasures located at the National Museum of Iraq. When asked at the time why U.S. troops did not actively seek to stop the lawlessness, Rumsfeld replied, [...] "Stuff happens... and it's untidy and freedom's untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things. They're also free {{to live their lives}} and do wonderful things. And that's what's going to happen here." [...] He further commented that, [...] "The images you are <b>seeing</b> <b>on</b> television you are seeing over, and over, and over, and it's the same picture of some person walking out of some building with a vase, and you see it 20 times, and you think, [...] "My goodness, were there that many vases?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Kenneth Tynan {{wrote that he}} [...] "could not love anyone who {{did not wish to}} see Look Back in Anger", {{describing}} the play as a [...] "minor miracle" [...] containing [...] "all the qualities...one had despaired of ever <b>seeing</b> <b>on</b> the stage—the drift towards anarchy, the instinctive leftishness, the automatic rejection of [...] "official" [...] attitudes, the surrealist sense of humour (e.g.,Jimmy describes an effeminate male friend as a 'female Emily Brontë'), the casual promiscuity, the sense of lacking a crusade worth fighting for and, underlying all these, the determination that no one who dies shall go unmourned." [...] Harold Hobson was also quick to recognize the importance of the play [...] "as a landmark of British theatre". He praised Osborne for the play, {{despite the fact that the}} [...] "blinkers still obscure his vision".|$|E

The brothers Neil (Kristoff St. John) and Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore) were introduced as love interests for Olivia and Drucilla. The Young and the Restless became popular among black viewers, which Williams and St. John attributed to the writing for the black characters. [...] "I play a CEO at a major corporation, that's something we don't see that often," [...] St. John said. [...] "And the show doesn't use the old African-American stereotypes {{that we have been}} <b>seeing</b> <b>on</b> TV, like the hustler, the pimp, the drug dealer. We have come a long way." [...] Though the characters held prominent positions in the fictional work place of Genoa City, they had little interaction with other characters outside of their jobs.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the disputed}} June 2009 Iranian presidential election, Obama {{condemned}} the Iranian government's crackdown on the Iranian Green Movement opposition, {{a group of}} pro-democracy demonstrators. Obama stated: [...] "we respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran, but [...] "I am deeply troubled by the violence that I've been <b>seeing</b> <b>on</b> television. I think that the democratic process -- free speech, the ability of people to peacefully dissent -- all those are universal values {{and need to be}} respected." [...] After more violent was directed at protesters, Obama stated: [...] "The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, beatings and imprisonments of the last few days" [...] and issued a strong condemnation of [...] "these unjust actions." [...] Some critics, including his 2012 presidential campaign rival Mitt Romney, faulted Obama, saying that he should have done more to support the Green Movement. Others disagreed, noting that the Green Movement did not need or want direct foreign support, and arguing that direct U.S. backing for the Iranian opposition would likely [...] "undermine its credibility, and perhaps even lend credence to the government’s assertion that the movement is a foreign-inspired plot that will rob Iran of its independence." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 5th Avenue Theatre's 2012 production, {{directed}} by Peter Rothstein, included African-American dancers and an African-American actor as Jud. The choice was intended, {{as in the}} Arena Stage production, to reflect the historical presence of African Americans in the Oklahoma territory, but it [...] "has some audience members squirming in their seats ... they're <b>seeing</b> <b>on</b> stage one of the ugliest stereotypes in our history: an imposing black man ravaging a petite white woman [...] the white hero ... all but urges Jud to hang himself – and even pantomimes the act.

One critic noted the historical [...] "license taken when an African-American farmhand is allowed to escort a white woman to the box dance. ... Maybe some people ... left with {{not so much a}} song in their head, but a question in their heart. And isn't that part of what theater is supposed to do?" [...] Another wrote: [...] "Rothstein's Oklahoma! is now the story of a crazy, sex obsessed black man ... lusting violently after his white mistress, who ends up murdered {{at the hands of a}} white man, who gets off scot free after a mock trial." ...|$|E

Please don't let Africa and your country down." [...] The talks, chaired by President Mwai Kibaki and attended by former President of Tanzania Benjamin Mkapa, who represented the African Union, were referred to as [...] "an opportunity that should neither be lost nor wasted" [...] by Obasanjo, who stated that [...] "A military solution is not an option. We appeal to your principles to make this dialogue a success." [...] Obasanjo went on to declare that the talks should accomplish a permanent cease-fire in eastern Congo, continued reinforcement of a corridor for humanitarian assistance in the region, and a lasting peace in Congo; he also praised the delegations for their efforts. Wetangula added, [...] "The pictures and clips we have been <b>seeing</b> <b>on</b> international TV screens remains a terrible indictment to all of us Africans, you Congolese in particular.
