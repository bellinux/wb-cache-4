40|$|This paper {{aimed at}} {{extending}} a model developed by Ladeveze to capture thermal expansion and coupled thermo-mechanical phenomena, as {{such as those}} encountered at elevated and extreme temperatures. In the new model a linear thermal expansion coefficient is added to equation of state {{to account for the}} thermal to mechanical coupling effects. The mechanical to thermal effects are introduced by assuming an internal heat generation due to residual strain effects. The constitutive relations of the coupled thermo-mechanical behaviors of ceramic matrix composite material model were incorporated into Abaqus finite element code as user defined material software. An extension of the methodology presented by Letombes to calibrate the ceramic matrix composite damage model parameters based on a woven <b>silicon-carbide</b> <b>silicon-carbide</b> <b>material</b> developed by Safran Group.

40|$|Abstract. GREGOR {{is a new}} open solar {{telescope}} with an aperture of 1. 5 m. It {{replaces the}} former 45 -cm Gregory Coudé telescope on the Canary island Tenerife. The optical concept {{is that of a}} double Gregory system. The main and the elliptical mirrors are made from a <b>silicon-carbide</b> <b>material</b> with high thermal conductivity. This is important to keep the mirrors on the ambient temperature avoiding local turbulence. GREGOR will be equipped with an adaptive optics system. The new telescope will be ready for operation in 2008. Post-focus instruments in the first stage will be a spectrograph for polarimetry in the near infrared and a 2 -dimensional spectrometer based on Fabry-Pérot interferometers for the visible. 1...|$|R

40|$|The newly {{completed}} Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Carbon Characterization Laboratory (CCL) {{is located}} in Lab-C 20 of the Idaho National Laboratory Research Center. This laboratory was established under the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) Project to support graphite research and development activities.

40|$|A {{new test}} {{methodology}} is described which allows access to loading rates that lie between split Hopkinson bar and shock-loading techniques. Gas gun experiments combined with velocity interferometry techniques {{have been used}} to experimentally determine the intermediate strain-rate loading behavior of Coors AD 995 alumina and Cercom <b>silicon-carbide</b> rods. Graded-density <b>materials</b> have been used as impactors; thereby eliminating the tension states generated by the radial stress components during the loading phase. Results of these experiments demonstrate that the time-dependent stress pulse generated during impact allows an efficient transition from the initial uniaxial strain loading to a uniaxial stress state as the stress pulse propagates through the rod. This allows access to intermediate loading rates over 5 x 10 {sup 3 }/s to a few times 10 {sup 4 }/s...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} design of a Folded Cascode CMOS Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp) in Raytheon’s 1. 2 -micron Silicon Carbide (SiC) process. The use of <b>silicon-carbide</b> as a <b>material</b> for {{integrated}} circuits (ICs) is gaining popularity due to its ability to function at high temperatures outside the range of typical silicon ICs. The goal of this design was to create an operational amplifier suitable for use in a high temperature analog-to-digital converter application. The amplifier has been designed to have a DC gain of 50 dB, a phase margin of 50 degrees, and a bandwidth of 2 MHz. The circuit’s application includes input ranging from 0 volts to 8 volts so a PMOS input differential pair was selected to allow the input range down to the VSS rail. The circuit has been designed to work over a temperature range of 25 °C to 300 °C...|$|R
40|$|Gallium nitride (GaN) {{technology}} is being adopted {{in a variety}} of power electronic applications due to their high efficiencies even at high switching speeds. In comparison with the silicon (Si) transistors, the GaN-based devices exhibit lower on-state resistance and parasitic capacitances. The thermal performance of the GaN transistors are also better than the Si counterparts due to their higher junction temperature and lower temperature-coefficient of on-resistance. These unique properties make the gallium-nitride power transistors an appropriate selection for power electronic converters and radio-frequency power amplifiers, where size, efficiency, power density, and dynamic performance are major requirements. Foreseeing the immense capabilities of the GaN transistors in the near future for the fast-growing electronic industry, this thesis endeavors to make the following contributions: (a) analyze the important properties of GaN as a semiconductor material, (b) study the formation of the 2 -dimensional electron gas layer required for current conduction, (c) determine the functionality of the GaN as a field-effect transistor, and (d) test its performance through simulations and experiments at high switching frequencies in power electronic converters, where the Si-based transistors cease to operate normally. The critical material properties include the intrinsic carrier concentration, the specific on-resistance, and the intrinsic carrier mobility. The dependence of these properties on the temperature is investigated. The comparison of these properties are made with the silicon and <b>silicon-carbide</b> (SiC) semiconductor <b>materials</b> to give a clear view about the superior performance of GaN over the other types. While the Si MOSFETs create a channel to conduct the electrons and holes between the source and drain terminals, the GaN field-effect transistors (FET) form a 2 -dimensional electron gas (2 -DEG) layer, whose thickness is controlled by the applied gate potential. Because of the high electron density in the 2 -DEG layer, the GaN FETs are termed as high-electron mobility transistors (HEMT). The operation of both enhancement and depletion mode GaN FETs are discussed in detail and the model of the drain current through the 2 -DEG layer is provided. The figure-of-merit (FOM) for the GaN transistors is explained and then compared with that of Si and SiC transistors. Two important implementations of GaN transistors are in the (a) pulse-width modulated synchronous-buck DC-DC power converters and (b) Class-D resonant inverters. These circuits are better representative examples since they comprise of one GaN FET (high-side switch) connected to a 2 ̆ 2 hot 2 ̆ 2 point and the other GaN FET (low-side switch) referenced to ground. While the low-side switch consumes minimum gate-drive power for turn ON/OFF transitions, the high-side switch demands a higher gate-drive power to operate the transistor as a switch. Also, these switches exhibit switching losses due to the charge/discharge process of the parasitic capacitances. The gate-drive power and switching losses increase as the switching frequency is increased. However, due to the superior performance and very low values of the device parasitic resistances and capacitances in the GaN transistors, higher switching frequencies can be achieved at very minimal switching losses. Simulations were performed to analyze the behavior of the two circuits at different switching frequencies and were compared with those using Si transistors. It is observed that the overall efficiency reduced to 48...|$|R
