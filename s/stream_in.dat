5|$|Due to the {{topography}} {{of the area}} in the vicinity of Scotch Run, the area near the stream was not settled until some time after the first settlement in the surrounding areas. Alexander McCauley settled on the <b>stream</b> <b>in</b> Beaver Township 1774. Some time before 1820, a carding mill was built by George Fleming on the stream southeast of Mainville.

5|$|In 2003, Martin Friday {{assessed}} {{streams in}} the watershed of Roaring Creek at 37 locations, using the United States Environmental Protection Agency's rapid assessment protocol.

40|$|AbstractBased on 390 benthic {{invertebrate}} {{samples from}} near-natural <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> Germany we defined eight stream type groups by Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS). The taxa lists were restricted to Mollusca, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, Coleoptera and Trichoptera species and evaluated on presence/absence level. At genus level, <b>streams</b> located <b>in</b> the lowlands differ from <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> lower mountainous {{areas and the}} Alps, while the two latter groups were undistinguishable. At species level, a clear separation of different stream size classes is visible in the lowlands; a second gradient {{is related to the}} bottom substrate. <b>Streams</b> <b>in</b> the Alps can be distinguished from <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> lower mountainous areas at species level. Within the lower mountainous regions a size gradient is detectable, a less obvious gradient indicates catchment geology. The resulting “bottom-up” stream typology is compared to other <b>stream</b> typological systems <b>in</b> Germany...|$|R

5|$|On Earth, the {{northern}} polar jet stream {{is the most}} important one for aviation and weather forecasting, as it is much stronger and at a much lower altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the Northern Hemisphere, while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles Antarctica and sometimes the southern tip of South America. The term jet <b>stream</b> <b>in</b> these contexts thus usually implies {{the northern}} polar jet stream.|$|E
5|$|On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, {{water quality}} scores {{can vary from}} 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal).

These scores are {{comparable}} to the 1986 to 1995 results of 94 and 93.

5|$|The {{concentration}} of alkalinity in Roaring Creek upstream of Lick Run is 9 milligrams per liter. Many nearby watersheds have been rendered nearly devoid of aquatic life due to acid mine drainage caused by coal mining. However, Roaring Creek {{has not been}} affected by this, {{although it has been}} still impacted by human land use. Sedimentation, siltation, and agricultural impacts occur in the watershed. The only impaired <b>stream</b> <b>in</b> the watershed is a small unnamed tributary that is impaired by siltation. From a chemical standpoint, Roaring Creek is infertile.|$|E

5|$|At 1200, Mott {{was brought}} to the {{position}} of L Company commander Captain George F. Sharra. Mott ordered Sharra to take command and organize a retreat. Sharra ordered his three platoons to withdraw. A battalion of North Korean soldiers began moving down the pass towards the American positions. Men of I Company were forced to withdraw through rice paddies south of the pass, being strafed by mortar and machine gun fire in the process. They also had to cross a -wide <b>stream</b> <b>in</b> the retreat, and some drowned in the process. Most of the Americans were forced to discard weapons, equipment and clothing in the retreat. Many of the men of L Company, {{as well as some of}} the wounded, were able to evacuate by truck.|$|E
5|$|During the withdraw, however, A Company {{ran into}} a sizable North Korean force and had {{scattered}} in the ensuing fight. Most of the company, including its commander were killed at close range. In this desperate action, Private First Class Luther H. Story, a weapons squad leader, fought so tenaciously that {{he was awarded the}} Medal of Honor. Badly wounded, Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape, and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at close range. Of those in the company, approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines. The next morning, under heavy fog, the group made its way by compass toward Yongsan. From a hill at 12:00, after the fog had lifted, the men looked down on the Battle of Yongsan which was then in progress. That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near Yongsan. Stragglers from this position continued to <b>stream</b> <b>in</b> the next few days as well.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Characteristics of low {{flows of}} nine <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> eastern Oregon were {{explored}} using long-term streamflow records. Year-to-year dependence of low flows is highly significant for <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> the Blue Mountain and the southeastern Oregon regions. Low streamflows {{increased over the}} period of record for seven of the selected streams. Flow duration curves, flow-date curves and low flow frequency curves were constructed for each stream. Flow per unit area is higher for <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> northeastern Oregon than <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> southeastern Oregon. Forecast equations for streamflow recessions were made for each stream. Forecasts are highly accurate for recession volume and August average flow except for Mill creek and Bridge Creek. Forecasts are poor for the later part of the water year. Even for the later part of the water year, highly accurate results are obtained when forecasts are made for shorter periods (about 40 days). Annual precipitation is fairly well-distributed over the whole year in eastern Oregon with July and August as the driest months. <b>Streams</b> <b>in</b> the Wallowa Mountain and southeastern Oregon regions showed higher trend similarities between summer low flows and precipitation than <b>streams</b> <b>in</b> the Blue Mountain region. Correlations between summer low flows and precipitation were highly significant for the Wallowa Mountain and the southeastern Oregon regions. Correlations between low flows and watershed parameters, as well as average annual precipitation, were found insignificant for all streams...|$|R
