5|$|Lumber thus {{became one}} of the leading {{industries}} in Pennsylvania. Trees were used to furnish fuel to heat homes, tannin for the many tanneries that were spread throughout the state, and wood for construction, furniture, and barrel making.

Rifle stocks and <b>shingles</b> were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first Conestoga wagons.|$|E
5|$|More than 930,000policyholders in South Florida lost {{coverage}} after 11insurance companies went bankrupt, {{caused by}} more than 600,000insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, {{in an effort to}} restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the <b>shingles</b> were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or <b>shingles</b> were peeled off, the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses.|$|E
40|$|A {{solar cell}} <b>shingle</b> {{was made of}} an array of solar cells on a lower portion of a {{substantially}} rectangular <b>shingle</b> substrate made of fiberglass cloth or the like. The solar cells may be encapsulated in flourinated ethylene propylene or some other weatherproof translucent or transparent encapsulant to form a combined electrical module and a roof <b>shingle.</b> The interconnected solar cells were connected to connectors {{at the edge of}} the substrate through a connection to a common electrical bus or busses. An overlap area was arranged to receive the overlap of a cooperating similar <b>shingle</b> so that the cell portion of the cooperating <b>shingle</b> may overlie the overlap area of the roof <b>shingle.</b> Accordingly, the same <b>shingle</b> serves the double function of an ordinary roof <b>shingle</b> which may be applied in the usual way and an array of cooperating solar cells from which electrical energy may be collected...|$|R

5|$|<b>Shingles,</b> {{also known}} as herpes zoster, {{is a viral disease}} {{characterized}} by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area.

5|$|Category1 storms usually cause no {{significant}} structural damage to most well-constructed permanent structures; however, they can topple unanchored mobile homes, {{as well as}} uproot or snap weak trees. Poorly attached roof <b>shingles</b> or tiles can blow off. Coastal flooding and pier damage are often associated with Category1 storms. Power outages are typically widespread to extensive, sometimes lasting several days. Even though it is the least intense type of hurricane, the storm can still produce widespread damage and can be a life-threatening storm.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 2011, North Michigan Avenue was {{completely}} repaved from the Chicago River to Oak Street with a durable stone-matrix asphalt pavement mix that incorporated {{high levels of}} recycled materials, including waste <b>shingles,</b> ground tire rubber, and asphalt millings, diverting some 800 tons of material from landfills.

5|$|Most of {{the early}} {{industrial}} development in Minneapolis was tied to St. Anthony Falls and the power it provided. Between 1848 and 1887, Minneapolis {{led the nation in}} sawmilling. In 1856, the mills produced 12 million board feet (28,000 mÂ³) of lumber. That total had risen to about 91,000,000 board feet (215,000 mÂ³) in 1869, and 960,000,000 board feet (2,270,000 mÂ³) in 1899. During the peak of this activity, at least 13 sawmills were operating on the falls. The sawmills also supported related industries such as mills that planed and smoothed the lumber; factories that built sashes, doors, and windows; and manufacturers of <b>shingles</b> and wooden buckets.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{winds were}} also {{reported}} in New England. The highest winds associated with Daisy were felt over coastal Maine, where winds of 70mph (115km/h) were commonly reported. Wind damage was severe and widespread; {{one person in}} Maine was killed when a fallen tree landed on, and crushed his car {{while he was in}} it. In the southeastern portion of the state, power outages were reported, due to fallen trees and tree limbs. In addition, some roof <b>shingles</b> blown off in Maine and Massachusetts, while other houses were completely unroofed. Daisy caused moderate to severe damage in eastern New England. Total wind damage in New England was estimated to have reached $500,000.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers' trip to Norway {{provided}} essential {{knowledge for}} the animators {{to come up}} with the design aesthetic for the film in terms of color, light, and atmosphere. According to Giaimo, there were three important factors that they had acquired from the Norway research trip: the fjords, which are the massive vertical rock formations, and serve as the setting for the secluded kingdom of Arendelle; the medieval stave churches, whose rustic triangular rooflines and <b>shingles</b> inspired the castle compound; and the rosemaling folk art, whose distinctive paneling and grid patterns informed the architecture, decor, and costumes.|$|E

5|$|As an extratropical storm over Newfoundland, Florence {{produced}} powerful winds peaking at 101mph (163km/h) {{and moderate}} amounts of rainfall {{of up to}} 2.6inches (67mm). Flooding and power outages were reported, although they were isolated. The hurricane caused flight interruptions at St. John's International Airport and also to the Trans Canada ferry between Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island in eastern Nova Scotia. Strong winds destroyed {{a house in the}} small Newfoundland village of Francois. Residents in Francois agreed to rebuild the wrecked home while the family temporarily resided in a summer home of another family. The winds also caused damage to <b>shingles</b> and sides of homes, while the strong waves damaged roads and boats along the Burin Peninsula.|$|E
