40|$|The <b>splay</b> tree, a {{self-adjusting}} form of {{binary search}} tree, is developed and analyzed. The {{binary search tree}} is a data structure for representing tables and lists so that accessing, inserting, and deleting items is easy. On an n-node <b>splay</b> tree, all the standard search tree operations have an amortized time bound of @log n) per operation, where by “amortized time” is meant the time per operation averaged over a worst-case sequence of operations. Thus <b>splay</b> trees are as efficient as balanced trees when total running time is the measure of interest. In addition, for sufficiently long access sequences, <b>splay</b> trees are as efficient, to within a constant factor, as static optimum search trees. The efficiency of <b>splay</b> trees comes not from an explicit structural constraint, as with balanced trees, but from applying a simple restructuring heuristic, called <b>splaying,</b> whenever the tree is accessed. Extensions of <b>splaying</b> give simplified forms of two other data structures: lexicographic or multidimensional search trees and link/ cut trees...|$|R

25|$|The frills of ceratopsians are {{incredibly}} diverse. They {{may have been}} used for protective purposes as the frill sometimes <b>splays</b> over the neck. However, some say that the frill would have provided little protection from other large dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus. Other possible functions include intraspecific communication for mating purposes or as a visual display of territorial protection, as seen in many common day organisms such as red-breasted robins. The frills also could have been used for species recognition purposes, as they seem to develop fairly early in life. There has also been evidence that ceratopsians care for their young, as bone-beds have been found of adult individuals with a nest of juveniles, although some refute this as viable evidence of care for young. There have also been bone-beds found with hundreds of adult ceratopsians, indicating herd activity. A few specimens have been found with puncture wounds, supporting the use of horns as protective or combative weapons. Other research examining juvenile ceratopsians reveals a change in horn morphology over time, suggesting frills and horns could have been used for intraspecific communication of age. Horns also could have been used for thermoregulation as indicated by isotope analysis, as aid in knocking down vegetation, or for horn-locking agonistic behavior.|$|E

As <b>splay</b> can be clinically important, patients with proximal tubule disease, mainly caused by hereditary nature and often in children, have a lower threshold but a normal Tm. Therefore, <b>splay</b> is suggested, probably because [...] "some individual cotransporters have a low glucose affinity but maximal transport rate (renal glycosuria).

Also, tubular transport is Tm-limited and the reabsorption mechanism being saturated at a plasma concentration more than 20 times than usual shows a low level of <b>splay.</b> Renal abnormalities of glucose excretion, causing glycosuria, may happen as either a result of reduced Tm for glucose or because of an abnormally wide range of nephron heterogeneity so <b>splay</b> of the glucose excretion curve is increased.

40|$|In {{subduction}} zones, major thrusts called <b>splay</b> faults {{are thought}} to slip coseismically during large earthquakes affecting the main plate interface. We propose an analytical condition for the activation of a <b>splay</b> fault based on force balance calculations and suggest thrusting along the <b>splay</b> fault is generally conditioned by {{the growth of the}} accretionary wedge, or by the erosion of the hanging wall. In theory, normal slip on the <b>splay</b> fault may occur when the décollement has a very low friction coefficient seaward. Such a low friction also implies an unstable extensional state within the outer wedge. Finite element elasto-plastic calculations with a geometry based on the Nankai Kumano section were performed and confirm that this analytical condition is a valid approximation. Furthermore, localized extension at a shallow level in the <b>splay</b> hanging wall is observed in models {{for a wide range of}} friction coefficients (from ∼ 0 to the value of internal friction coefficient of the rock, here equals to 0. 4). The timing of slip established for the <b>splay</b> fault branch drilled on Nankai Kumano transect suggests a phase of concurrent <b>splay</b> and accretionary wedge growth ≈ 2 Ma to ≈ 1. 5 Ma, followed by a locking of the <b>splay</b> ≈ 1. 3 Ma. Active extension is observed in the hanging wall. This evolution can be explained by the activation of a deeper and weaker décollement, followed by an interruption of accretion. Activation of a <b>splay</b> as a normal fault, as hypothesized in the case of the Tohoku 2011 earthquake, can be achieved only if the friction coefficient on the décollement drops to near zero. We conclude that the tectonic stress state largely determines long-term variations of tightly related <b>splay</b> fault and outer décollement activity and thus influences where and how coseismic rupture ends, but that occurrence of normal slip on a <b>splay</b> fault requires coseismic friction reduction...|$|R

This approach is generalized as relativistic programming. The relativistic programming is the programming technique for concurrent shared-memory architectures which tolerates different threads seeing events occurring in diﬀerent orders, so that events are not necessarily globally ordered, but rather subject to constraints of per-thread ordering.

60|$|The Sukh Mahal was {{completely}} {{separated from the}} city, and {{might have been a}} country-house. It should be mentioned that Boondi is jammed into a V-shaped gorge--the valley at the main entrance being something less than five hundred yards across. As it <b>splays</b> out, the thickly packed houses follow its lines, and, seen from above, seem like cattle herded together preparatory to a stampede through the gate. Owing to the set of the hills, very little of the city is visible except from the Palace. It was in search of this latter that the Englishman went abroad and became so interested in the streets that he forgot all about it for a time. Jeypore is a show-city and is decently drained; Udaipur is blessed with a State Engineer and a printed form of Government; for Jodhpur the dry sand, the burning sun, and an energetic doctor have done a good deal, but Boondi has none of these things. The crampedness of the locality aggravates the evil, and it can only be in the rains which channel and furrow the rocky hillsides that Boondi is at all swept out. The Nal Sagar, a lovely little stretch of water, takes up the head of the valley called Banda Gorge, and must, in the nature of things, receive a good deal of unholy drainage. But setting aside this weakness, it is a fascinating place--this jumbled city of straight streets and cool gardens, where gigantic mangoes and peepuls intertwine over gurgling watercourses, and the cuckoo comes at midday. It boasts no foolish Municipality to decree when a house is dangerous and uninhabitable. The newer shops are built into, on to, over, and under time-blackened ruins of an older day, and the little children skip about tottering arcades and grass-grown walls, while their parents chatter below in the crowded bazaar.
