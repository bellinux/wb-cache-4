5|$|Although , {{a variant}} of <b>sporangium,</b> is an eye rhyme for orange, {{it is not a}} true rhyme as its second {{syllable}} is pronounced with an unreduced vowel , and often stressed.|$|E
5|$|On fertile fronds, from 1 to 15 {{elliptical}} or narrow sori can {{be found}} on the underside of each pinna. They are 0.5 to 1.5millimeters long, covered by translucent, pale tan indusia with somewhat jagged edges. Each <b>sporangium</b> holds 64 spores. The species has a chromosome number of 2n = 72 in the sporophyte; it is a diploid.|$|E
5|$|The Rhynia {{plant was}} small and stick-like, with simple dichotomously {{branching}} stems without leaves, each tipped by a <b>sporangium.</b> The simple form echoes that of the sporophyte of mosses, {{and it has been}} shown that Rhynia had an alternation of generations, with a corresponding gametophyte in the form of crowded tufts of diminutive stems only a few millimetres in height. Rhynia thus falls midway between mosses and early vascular plants like ferns and clubmosses. From a carpet of moss-like gametophytes, the larger Rhynia sporophytes grew much like simple clubmosses, spreading by means of horizontal growing stems growing rhizoids that anchored the plant to the substrate. The unusual mix of moss-like and vascular traits and the extreme structural simplicity of the plant had huge implications for botanical understanding.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium resiliens is a {{triploid}} and reproduces apogamously, producing 32 spores per <b>sporangium.</b> Specimens with 64 well-formed spores per <b>sporangium,</b> {{believed to}} be sexually reproducing, were collected from Green Gulch in the Chisos Mountains in 1937, although other specimens since collected in the area have the typical 32 spores per <b>sporangium.</b>|$|E
25|$|The dictyostelids {{are another}} group {{formerly}} classified among the fungi. They are slime molds that feed as unicellular amoebae, but aggregate into a reproductive stalk and <b>sporangium</b> under certain conditions. Cells of the reproductive stalk, {{as well as}} the spores formed at the apex, possess a cellulose wall. The spore wall has been shown to possess three layers, the middle of which is composed primarily of cellulose, and the innermost is sensitive to cellulase and pronase.|$|E
25|$|Bryophytes {{have life}} cycles that are {{gametophyte}} dominated. The longer lived, more prominent autotrophic plant is the gametophyte. The sporophyte in mosses and liverworts {{consists of an}} unbranched stalk (a seta) bearing a single <b>sporangium</b> or spore-producing capsule. Even when capable of photosynthesis, as in mosses and hornworts, bryophyte sporophytes require additional photosynthate from the gametophyte to sustain growth and spore development and are dependent on the gametophyte for their supplies of water, mineral nutrients and nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the polysporangiophytes, more {{formally}} called Polysporangiophyta, {{was first published in}} 1997 by Kenrick and Crane. (The taxobox at the right represents their view of the classification of the polysporangiophytes.) The defining feature of the clade is that the sporophyte branches and bears multiple sporangia. This distinguishes polysporangiophytes from liverworts, mosses and hornworts, which have unbranched sporophytes each with a single <b>sporangium.</b> Polysporangiophytes {{may or may not have}} vascular tissue – those that do are vascular plants or tracheophytes.|$|E
25|$|Bryophytes {{reproduce}} sexually, but {{the larger}} and commonly-seen organisms are haploid and produce gametes. The gametes fuse {{to form a}} zygote which develops into a <b>sporangium,</b> which in turn produces haploid spores. The diploid stage is relatively small and short-lived compared to the haploid stage, i.e. haploid dominance. The advantage of diploidy, heterosis, only exists in the diploid life generation. Bryophytes retain sexual reproduction {{despite the fact that}} the haploid stage does not benefit from heterosis. This may be an indication that the sexual reproduction has advantages other than heterosis, such as genetic recombination between members of the species, allowing the expression of a wider range of traits and thus making the population more able to survive environmental variation.|$|E
25|$|The species most {{similar to}} A.×ebenoides is A.tutwilerae, long {{considered}} conspecific and only found at Havana Glen, Alabama. The two may be distinguished by their spores; A.tutwilerae bears sixty-four well-formed spores per <b>sporangium,</b> while those of A.×ebenoides are sterile and malformed. In the wild, A.×ebenoides {{is most likely}} to be confused with A.pinnatifidum, which also has a long, lobed blade. Nonetheless, there are several marked characters that distinguish them. A.pinnatifidum has a stipe and rachis which are mostly green, purple only at the base, and the lobes of the blade are more regular than those of A.ebenoides. The blade of A.pinnatifidum is widest at the base, while that of A.×ebenoides is widest somewhat above the base.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{its small}} size, the {{gametophyte}} stage is not generally noticed until the stalked <b>sporangium</b> develops, and is locatable principally because the <b>sporangium</b> grows upon {{and above the}} tiny gametophyte. [...] The extremely reduced state of Buxbaumia plants {{raises the question of}} how it makes or obtains sufficient nutrition for survival. [...] In contrast to most mosses, Buxbaumia does not produce abundant chlorophyll and is saprophytic. [...] It is possible that some of its nutritional needs are met by fungi that grow within the plant.|$|E
500|$|Each pinna on {{a fertile}} frond has {{three or more}} pairs of sori. These are [...] long, and rusty or dark brown in color. They are located between the margin and the midvein of the pinnae. The sori are covered by opaque indusia with untoothed edges. The indusia from white to light tan in color and have a membraneous texture. Each <b>sporangium</b> holds 64spores. The species has a {{chromosome}} number of 144 in the sporophyte, indicating an allotetraploid origin. It sporulates from June to December.|$|E
500|$|The sporocarps are {{functionally}} and developmentally modified leaflets, {{although they}} have much shorter stalks than the vegetative leaflets. Inside the sporocarp, the modified leaflets bear several sori, each of which consists of several sporangia covered by a thin hood of tissue (the indusium). [...] Each sorus includes a mix of two types of <b>sporangium,</b> each type producing only one of two kinds of spores. [...] Toward {{the center of each}} sorus and developing first are the megasporangia, each of which will produce a single large female megaspore. [...] Surrounding them {{at the edge of the}} sorus and developing later are the microsporangia, each of which will produce many small male microspores.|$|E
500|$|The long-stemmed, blackish-brown or blackish-purple, barely {{translucent}} sporangia of Barbeyella are spherical, 0.15 to 0.2mm {{in diameter}} and together with the stem measure 0.3 to 0.7mm long. They are usually scattered on the substrate, but also often grouped in loose, large colonies. The hypothallus (the tissue upon which the sporangiophore rests) [...] has a diameter of at least 0.7mm. Although not visible on mosses, it has a reddish-brown color when growing on wood. The brownish-black stem is up to 0.1mm thick, thinning to 5µm towards the top and is filled with protoplasmatic scrap material. The columella – arising from the stem tip – matures at the upper end at roughly half {{the height of the}} sporangiophore into 7 to 13 simple or occasionally bifurcated, 1 to 4µm large, dark-brown capillitium strands. Usually individual, occasionally in pairs, these are firmly fused with the lobed segments of the peridium, which are round in cross-section. When the spores mature, the <b>sporangium</b> splits and empties into the peridium towards the base. This prevents the lobes of the peridium from detaching and provides spore dispersal over a longer period, similar to a dehiscing capsule. The sporangia are filled towards the top with plasmatic granules, which diminish increasingly towards the base. Depending {{on the size of the}} plasmatic granules, the sporangia appear [...] or smooth.|$|E
2500|$|Each segment (pinna or lobe) of {{a fertile}} frond has one to six sori, {{sometimes}} {{more than forty}} in extreme cases. The sori usually fuse with one another as they age. These are [...] long They are covered with thin, whitish indusia with untoothed edges, which are persistent. Each <b>sporangium</b> holds 64 spores. The species has a chromosome number of 144 in the sporophyte, indicating an allotetraploid origin.|$|E
2500|$|Pinnae of {{the fertile}} fronds carry {{from one to}} twelve pairs of sori on their underside, each [...] long. Each pair of sori forms a chevron, {{pointing}} towards {{the base of the}} pinna along its central axis. An indusium covers each sorus; these are whitish and translucent or silvery with a slightly toothed or erose (irregularly jagged) edge, soon withering to reveal the sori. Each <b>sporangium</b> in a sorus carries 64spores. The diploid sporophyte has a chromosome number of 72.|$|E
2500|$|Bishop's {{first novel}} {{for young people}} [...] "whatever their age" [...] was {{published}} in June 2016 by the Fairwood Press imprint Kudzu Planet Productions. Ten-year-old Joel-Brock Lollis returns home from a baseball game to discover that his parents and sister have been kidnapped, and proceeds to recruit two employees of the local big-box department store in his quest to rescue his family. Reviewer Paul Di Filippo writes [...] "Bishop’s prodigious powers of invention serve him well here too. There are many angles to the tale, including an ongoing dialogue between Joel-Brock and his future self. The bulk of the book {{takes place in the}} <b>Sporangium</b> , and there’s always a new miracle or horror around the bend. While the marvels are unpredictable and chaotic, they also exhibit the consistency and inner logic of the best dream worlds." ...|$|E
2500|$|The leaf blades are narrow, with {{parallel}} edges {{following the}} stem, ranging from [...] {{in length and}} [...] in width. They come to a point at both base and tip, and have a leathery texture. They are often divided into pinnae (leaflets) near the tip, usually two (but sometimes four). These pinnae are sharply angled towards {{the tip of the}} blade, giving it a forked appearance. They also come to a point at the tip, and have a few widely spaced, irregular teeth. The rachis (central axis of the leaf) is green and shiny, and the leaves, including the rachis, are free of hairs or scales. Fertile and sterile fronds are the same in appearance; in fertile fronds, the sori are linear, parallel to the edges of the pinna, usually two or more per pinna. The sori are covered by thin, pale tan indusia, with entire edges. It contains 64 spores per <b>sporangium,</b> and most sporophytes have a chromosome number of 2n=144 (a tetraploid).|$|E
2500|$|The blade is {{cut into}} pinnae {{throughout}} its length, from 20 to 40pairs per leaf. The pinnae are sessile (stalkless) or have minute stalks and are rectangular in shape, tapering slightly toward the tip. In North American and Mexican material, {{those in the}} middle of the leaf blade measure from [...] in length (rarely as small as [...] ) and from [...] in width. In Guatemalan material, the pinnae typically measured from [...] in length and from [...] in width, the ratio of length to breadth being typically 1.5 to 2.5. Each pinna usually has an auricle at its base, pointing towards the tip of the blade; occasionally auricles pointing towards the base of the blade are also present. The edges of the pinnae are untoothed or have shallowly rounded teeth (or deep, rounded teeth in exceptional shade-grown specimens), and are often rolled under. The tips of the pinnae are blunt. [...] The lower pinnae are widely spaced on the rachis, and reflexed downwards. Leaf veins are free (they do not rejoin one another) and are difficult to see; fertile veins are once-forking and do not terminate in hydathodes (prominent swellings). Fertile pinnae bear 2 to 6pairs of sori (rarely as few as 1pair or as many as 10), about [...] in length, on both sides of the midrib; the sori are crowded at the edges and often merge as they age. The indusia covering them are from [...] long (rarely to [...] ) and from [...] wide, greenish or pale yellowish to whitish in color and opaque, with straight or slightly jagged edges. They are persistent after the spores mature, but may be hidden by the full sporangia. A.resiliens has a chromosome number of n = 2n = 108 and produces 32 unreduced, round or egg-shaped spores per <b>sporangium.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Dawson's {{results are}} the more remarkable, as the {{numerous}} specimens of British coal, from various localities, which I have examined, tell one tale as to the predominance of the spore and <b>sporangium</b> element in their composition; and as it is exactly in the finest and purest coals, such as the [...] "Better-Bed" [...] coal of Lowmoor, that the spores and sporangia obviously constitute almost the entire mass of the deposit.|$|E

50|$|The {{life cycle}} of Pilobolus begins with a black <b>sporangium</b> that has been {{discharged}} onto a plant substrate such as grass. A herbivorous animal such as a horse then eats the substrate, unknowingly consuming the <b>sporangium</b> as well. The Pilobolus <b>sporangium</b> survives the passage through the gastrointestinal tract without germinating, and emerges with the excrement. Once outside its host, spores within the <b>sporangium</b> germinate and grow as a mycelium within the excrement, where it is a primary colonizer. Later, the fungus fruits to produce more spores.|$|E
50|$|Mucor mucedo (genus species) uses asexual reproduction. When erect hyphal sporangiophores are formed.The {{tip of the}} sporangiophore swells to form a globose <b>sporangium</b> that {{contains}} uninucleate, haploid sporangiospores.

50|$|This fungus {{normally}} grows {{beneath the}} surface - a sensitivity to oxygen inhibits radial growth at the hyphae.According to McVickar (1942), and later amended by Ootaki et al., (1993), the development of P. crystallinus may be divided into six stages: In stage I, the sporangiophore initially elongates at the apex, but does not rotate. In stage II, the sporangiophore develops a <b>sporangium.</b> In stage III, after {{the development of the}} <b>sporangium,</b> there is a temporary cessation of growth. In stage IV, a subsporangial vesicle expands beneath the <b>sporangium.</b> This is followed by stage V, where the spore matures, and the region of hypha directly below the subsporangial vesicle continues elongating. Finally, in stage VI, the subsporangial vesicle bursts and throws the <b>sporangium</b> into the air.Scanning and transmission electron microscopy has shown that the surface of the <b>sporangium</b> is covered with crystals of two distinct sizes. The larger crystals enclose spines having a central pore.|$|E
50|$|Mechanisms of {{dispersal}} {{are less}} known in these genera. In both genera,the sporangiophore, guided by light, elongates until the <b>sporangium</b> {{is brought into}} contact with a solid surface. In Pilaira, contact with the surface causes a rupture at the columella, which releases the <b>sporangium,</b> which adheres to the new surface using a method similar to Pilobolus. In Utharomyces, contact with the surface ruptures the subsporangial swelling. This releases cytoplasm, {{which is used to}} glue the upper portion of the swelling containing the <b>sporangium</b> to the substrate.|$|E

Many zygomycetes produce multiple sporangiospores inside a single <b>sporangium.</b> Some have evolved multiple small sporangiola that contain few sporangiospores. In some cases, there may be a few as three spores in each sporangiolum, and a few species have sporangiola which contain just a single spore. Choanephora, a zygomycete, has a sporangiolum that contains one spore with a <b>sporangium</b> wall that is visible {{at the base of the}} <b>sporangium.</b> This structure is similar to a conidium, which has two, fused cell walls, an inner spore wall and an outer <b>sporangium</b> wall.|$|E
