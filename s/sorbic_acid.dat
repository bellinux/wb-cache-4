25|$|<b>Sorbic</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{winemaking}} additive used {{often in}} sweet wines as a preservative against fungi, bacteria and yeast growth. Unlike sulfur dioxide, {{it does not}} hinder {{the growth of the}} lactic acid bacteria. In the European Union, the amount of <b>sorbic</b> <b>acid</b> that can be added is limited — no more than 200mg/l. Most humans have a detection threshold of 135mg/l, with some having a sensitivity to detect its presence at 50mg/l. <b>Sorbic</b> <b>acid</b> can produce off flavors and aromas which can be described as “rancid”. When lactic acid bacteria metabolize sorbates in the wine, it creates a wine fault that is most recognizable by an aroma of crushed Pelargonium geranium leaves.|$|E
2500|$|Geranium taint, as {{the name}} suggests, is a flavour and aroma taint in wine {{reminiscent}} of geranium leaves. The compound responsible is 2-ethoxyhexa-3,5-diene, which has a low sensory threshold concentration of 1ng/L. In wine it is formed during the metabolism of potassium sorbate by lactic acid bacteria. Potassium sorbate is sometimes added to wine as a preservative against yeast, however its use is generally {{kept to a minimum}} due to the possibility of the taint developing. The production of the taint begins with the conversion of <b>sorbic</b> <b>acid</b> to the alcohol sorbinol. The alcohol is then isomerised in the presence of acid to 3,5-hexadiene-2-ol, which is then esterified with ethanol to form 2-ethoxy-3,5-hexadiene. [...] Mannitol is usually produced in wines that undergo malolactic fermentation {{with a high level of}} residual sugars still present. Expert winemakers oftentimes add small amounts of sulfur dioxide during the crushing step to reduce early bacterial growth.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wine that}} has not been sterilized by {{filtration}} might well still contain live yeast cells and bacteria. If both alcoholic and malolactic fermentation have run to completion, and neither excessive oxygen nor Brettanomyces yeast are present, this ought to cause no problems; modern hygiene has largely eliminated spoilage by bacteria such as acetobacter, which turns wine into vinegar. If there is residual sugar, however, it may undergo secondary fermentation, creating dissolved carbon dioxide as a by-product. When the wine is opened, it will be spritzy or [...] "sparkling". In a wine intended to be still this is regarded as a serious fault; it can even cause the bottle to explode. Similarly, a wine {{that has not}} been put through complete malolactic fermentation may undergo it in bottle, reducing its acidity, generating carbon dioxide, and adding a diacetyl butterscotch aroma. Brettanomyces yeasts add 4-ethylphenol, 4-ethylguaiacol and isovaleric acid horse-sweat aromas. These phenomena may be prevented by sterile filtration, by the addition of relatively large quantities of sulfur dioxide and sometimes <b>sorbic</b> <b>acid,</b> by mixing in alcoholic spirit to give a fortified wine of sufficient strength to kill all yeast and bacteria, or by pasteurization.|$|E

50|$|An {{outstanding}} {{feature of}} Z. bailii is its exceptional resistance to weak acid preservatives {{commonly used in}} foods and beverages, such as acetic, lactic, propionic, benzoic, <b>sorbic</b> <b>acids</b> and sulfur dioxide. In addition, it is reported that the yeast is able to tolerate high ethanol concentrations (≥ 15% (v/v)). The ranges of pH and aw for growth are wide, 2.0 - 7.0 and 0.80 - 0.99, respectively. Besides being preservative resistant, other features {{that contribute to the}} spoilage capacity of Z. bailii are: (i) its ability to vigorously ferment hexose sugars (e.g. glucose and fructose), (ii) ability to cause spoilage from an extremely low inoculum (e.g. one viable cell per package of any size), (iii) moderate osmotolerance (in comparison to Zygosaccharomyces rouxii). Therefore, foods at particular risk to spoilage by this yeast usually have low pH (2.5 to 5.0), low aw and contain sufficient amounts of fermentable sugars.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Providing {{organic acids}} as a feed {{additive}} enhances the {{health status of}} piglets, particularly in the suckling period and in the problematical time after weaning. Depending on type and the area of application for the acids, the dosage is between 0. 1 and 4 % of the total feed. For example, formic, fumaric or <b>sorbic</b> <b>acids</b> are used alone or in mixtures. Positive effects were verified in the feed, in the digestive tract and in the metabolism of piglets. A lot of studies show a stabilisation in performance relating to weight, growth and health. 127 piglets were separated into a treated and control group and observed for {{the effectiveness of the}} organic acids. The live weights on day 5, 28, 42 and 76 were recorded. Both groups had comparable growth in the suckling period. The comparison identified an advantage for piglets receiving organic acid. On average this group of animals had a higher weight and a lower variability of live weights at day 76 (table 1). Other positive tendencies for the treated group were lower losses and a higher rate of piglets attaining at least a weight of 25 kg at 76 days of age.

40|$|Weak acids {{are widely}} used as food {{preservatives}} (e. g., acetic, propionic, benzoic, and <b>sorbic</b> <b>acids),</b> herbicides (e. g., 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), and as antimalarial (e. g., artesunic and artemisinic acids), anticancer (e. g., artesunic acid), and immunosuppressive (e. g., mycophenolic acid) drugs, among other possible applications. The understanding of the mechanisms underlying the adaptive response and resistance to these weak acids is a prerequisite to develop more effective strategies to control spoilage yeasts, {{and the emergence of}} resistant weeds, drug resistant parasites or cancer cells. Furthermore, the identification of toxicity mechanisms and resistance determinants to weak acid-based pharmaceuticals increases current knowledge on their cytotoxic effects and may lead to the identification of new drug targets. This review integrates current knowledge on the mechanisms of toxicity and tolerance to weak acid stress obtained in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae using genome-wide approaches and more detailed gene-by-gene analysis. The major features of the yeast response to weak acids in general, and the more specific responses and resistance mechanisms towards a specific weak acid or a group of weak acids, depending on the chemical nature of the side chain R group (R-COOH), are highlighted. The involvement of several transcriptional regulatory networks in the genomic response to different weak acids is discussed, focusing on the regulatory pathways controlled by the transcription factors Msn 2 p/Msn 4 p, War 1 p, Haa 1 p, Rim 101 p, and Pdr 1 p/Pdr 3 p, which are known to orchestrate weak acid stress response in yeast.

40|$|Some yeasts {{have the}} {{peculiar}} ability {{to grow in}} the presence of weak acids at rather low pH. These conditions are predominant in preserved foods and beverages such as fruit concentrates, juices, wine, where these yeasts are responsible for spoilage. The main preservatives currently utilized by food industries are <b>sorbic,</b> propionic, benzoic <b>acids</b> and SO 2. It is usually assumed that weak acids diffuse through the plasma membrane in the undissociated form. In the cytoplasm, where the pH is higher, dissociation occurs resulting in accumulation of the lipid-insoluble anion and internal acidification. This is probably a very general mechanism of preventing microbial growth in foods...|$|R

Lower concentrations of PA and SA (0. 05 to 0. 1 % w/w) in wheat seeds are ineffective against both fungal growth and aflatoxin production, whilst the combined use of butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT), and PA or SA was more effective in controlling aflatoxin production than their use as single components...|$|R

50|$|Some {{studies have}} {{revealed}} the negligible effects of different sugars on preservative resistance of Z. bailii, e.g. comparable <b>sorbic</b> and benzoic <b>acid</b> resistance was observed regardless whether {{the cells were}} grown in culture medium containing glucose or fructose as fermentable substrates. However, the preservative resistance of the yeast is influenced by glucose level, with maximum resistance obtained at 10 - 20% (w/v) sugar concentrations. As Z. bailii is moderately osmotolerant, the salt and sugar levels in foods are usually insufficient to control its growth. The highest tolerance to salt has been observed at low pH values, e.g. the maximum NaCl allowing growth was 12.5% (w/v) at pH 3.0 whereas this was only 5.0% (w/v) at pH 5.0. Moreover, the presence of either salt or sugar has {{a positive effect on}} the ability of Z. bailii to initiate growth at extreme pH levels, e.g. the yeast showed no growth at pH 2.0 in the absence of NaCl and sucrose, but grew at this pH in 2.5% (w/v) NaCl or 50% (w/v) sucrose.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} several {{inhibition}} biosensors {{have been proposed}} {{for the analysis of}} aqueous solutions of phytodrugs. We recently built an inhibition OPEE (organic phase enzyme electrode) based on the inhibition of tyrosinase for the analysis of triazine, carbamate, and organophosphate pesticides operating in water-saturated chloroform. It was possible to determine the concentration of these pesticides contained in lipophilic or aqueous samples by relating it to the inhibiting action measured directly in water, or in water-saturated chloroform, after using the same solvent to extract the pesticides themselves. In the present investigation, attention was focused above all on two points of particular interest: on the study of potential interferents, i. e., of other inhibitors of the tyrosinase enzyme consisting above all, when operating in aqueous solution, of different heavy metal ions or several carboxylic acids, such as cinnamic, <b>sorbic,</b> or benzoic <b>acids,</b> which can apparently interfere in inhibition analysis of pesticides in aqueous matrixes; in the second place, on a detailed comparison {{of the results of the}} analysis of triazine, organophosphate, and carbamate pesticides in the presence of the above-mentioned interferents operating both in aqueous solution and in water-saturated chloroform...|$|R
40|$|Cells of Zygosaccharomyces bailii ISA 1307 {{grown in}} a medium with acetic acid, ethanol, or {{glycerol}} as the sole carbon and energy source transported acetic acid by a saturable transport system. This system accepted propionic and formic acids but not lactic, <b>sorbic,</b> and benzoic <b>acids.</b> When the carbon source was glucose or fructose, the cells displayed activity of a mediated transport system specific for acetic acid, apparently {{not being able to}} recognize other monocarboxylic acids. In both types of cells, ethanol inhibited the transport of labelled acetic acid. The inhibition was noncompetitive, and the dependence of the maximum transport rate on the ethanol concentration was found to be exponential. These results reinforced the belief that, under the referenced growth conditions, the acid entered the cells mainly through a transporter protein. The simple diffusion of the undissociated acid appeared to contribute, with a relatively low weight, to the overall acid uptake. It was concluded that in Z. bailii, ethanol plays a protective role against the possible negative effects of acetic acid by inhibiting its transport and accumulation. Thus, the intracellular concentration of the acid could be maintained at levels lower than those expected if the acid entered the cells only by simple diffusion...|$|R

40|$|Weak {{organic acids}} are {{naturally}} occurring compounds that are commercially used as preservatives {{in the food}} and beverage industries.

There {{are a number of}} theories that explain the antifungal properties of these weak acids, but the exact mechanism is still unknown. We set out to quantitatively determine the contributions of various mechanisms of antifungal activity of these weak acids, as well as the mechanisms that yeast uses to counteract their effects. We analyzed the effects of four weak organic acids differing in lipophilicity (sorbic, benzoic, propionic, and acetic acids) on growth and intracellular pH (pH(i)) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although lipophilicity of the acids correlated with the rate of acidification of the cytosol, our data confirmed that not initial acidification, but rather the cell's ability to restore pH(i), was a determinant for growth inhibition. This pH(i) recovery in turn depended {{on the nature of the}} organic anion. We identified long-term acidification as the major cause of growth inhibition under acetic acid stress. Restoration of pH(i), and consequently growth rate, in the presence of this weak acid required the full activity of the plasma membrane ATPase Pma 1 p. Surprisingly, the proposed anion export pump Pdr 12 p was shown to play an important role in the ability of yeast cells to restore the pH(i) upon lipophilic (<b>sorbic</b> and benzoic) <b>acid</b> stress, probably through a charge interaction of anion and proton transport...|$|R

25|$|The {{acids in}} wine are an {{important}} component in both winemaking and the finished product of wine. They are present in both grapes and wine, having direct influences on the color, balance and taste of the wine {{as well as the}} growth and vitality of yeast during fermentation and protecting the wine from bacteria. The measure of the amount of acidity in wine is known as the “titratable acidity” or “total acidity”, which refers to the test that yields the total of all acids present, while strength of acidity is measured according to pH, with most wines having a pH between 2.9 and 3.9. Generally, the lower the pH, the higher the acidity in the wine. However, there is no direct connection between total acidity and pH (it is possible to find wines with a high pH for wine and high acidity). In wine tasting, the term “acidity” refers to the fresh, tart and sour attributes of the wine which are evaluated in relation to how well the acidity balances out the sweetness and bitter components of the wine such as tannins. Three primary acids are found in wine grapes: tartaric, malic and citric acids. During the course of winemaking and in the finished wines, acetic, butyric, lactic and succinic acids can play significant roles. Most of the acids involved with wine are fixed acids with the notable exception of acetic acid, mostly found in vinegar, which is volatile and can contribute to the wine fault known as volatile acidity. Sometimes, additional acids, such as ascorbic, <b>sorbic</b> and sulfurous <b>acids,</b> are used in winemaking.|$|R
