Numerous SAS modules for web, social media and marketing analytics {{may be used}} to profile customers and prospects, predict their behaviors and manage and optimize communications. SAS also provides the SAS Fraud Framework. The framework's primary functionality is to monitor transactions across different applications, networks and partners and use analytics to identify anomalies that are indicative of fraud. SAS Enterprise GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance) provides risk modeling, <b>scenario</b> <b>analysis</b> and other functions in order to manage and visualize risk, compliance and corporate policies. There is also a SAS Enterprise Risk Management product-set designed primarily for banks and financial services organizations.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary bank {{management}} {{methods for}} liquidity {{are based on}} maturity analysis of all the bank's assets and liabilities (off balance sheet exposures may also be included). Assets and liabilities are put into residual contractual maturity buckets such as 'on demand', 'less than 1 month', '2–3 months' etc. These residual contractual maturities may be adjusted to account for expected counter party behaviour such as early loan repayments due to borrowers refinancing and expected renewals of term deposits to give forecast cash flows. This analysis highlights any large future net outflows of cash and enables the bank to respond before they occur. <b>Scenario</b> <b>analysis</b> may also be conducted, depicting scenarios including stress scenarios such as a bank-specific crisis.|$|E

[...] Since these future changes are highly uncertain, one approach is that of <b>scenario</b> <b>analysis.</b> [...] In <b>scenario</b> <b>analysis,</b> scenarios are developed {{that are based on}} differing assumptions of future development patterns. An example of this are the [...] "SRES" [...] emissions scenarios produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The SRES scenarios project a wide range of possible future emissions levels. [...] The SRES scenarios are [...] "baseline" [...] or [...] "non-intervention" [...] scenarios, in that they assume no specific policy measures to control future GHG emissions. [...] The different SRES scenarios contain widely differing assumptions of future social and economic changes. For example, the SRES [...] "A2" [...] emissions scenario projects a future population level of 15 billion people in the year 2100, but the SRES [...] "B1" [...] scenario projects a lower population level of 7 billion people. [...] The SRES scenarios were not assigned probabilities by the IPCC, but some authors [...] have argued that particular SRES scenarios are more likely to occur than others.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Scenario</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{a process}} of {{analyzing}} possible future events by considering alternative possible outcomes (sometimes called [...] "alternative worlds"). Thus, <b>scenario</b> <b>analysis,</b> {{which is one of the}} main forms of projection, does not try to show one exact picture of the future. Instead, it presents several alternative future developments. Consequently, a scope of possible future outcomes is observable. Not only are the outcomes observable, also the development paths leading to the outcomes. In contrast to prognoses, the <b>scenario</b> <b>analysis</b> is not based on extrapolation of the past or the extension of past trends. It does not rely on historical data and does not expect past observations to remain valid in the future. Instead, it tries to consider possible developments and turning points, which may only be connected to the past. In short, several scenarios are fleshed out in a <b>scenario</b> <b>analysis</b> to show possible future outcomes. Each scenario normally combines optimistic, pessimistic, and more and less probable developments. However, all aspects of scenarios should be plausible. Although highly discussed, experience has shown that around three scenarios are most appropriate for further discussion and selection. More scenarios risks making the analysis overly complicated.|$|E
