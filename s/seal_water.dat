40|$|In {{the design}} of a {{drainage}} system, allowable drainage flow quantity (drainage capability) is defined for each pipe diameter in order to prevent <b>seal</b> <b>water</b> from breaking. In Japan, SHASE-S 218 (Heating, Air-Conditioning, and Sanitary Standard) stipulates the evaluation standard for drainage capability.

One is that pressure in the pipe should fall within ± 400 Pa, and the other is that the seal loss should be less than 25 mm. Nevertheless, recent studies revealed that the connecting of traps attenuates pneumatic pressure in pipes and causes a tendency of the power spectrum distribution to change.

40|$|Rail seat {{deterioration}} (RSD) {{is considered}} the most critical problem with concrete-tie performance on North American freight railroads. RSD is {{the deterioration of the}} concrete underneath the rail that results in problems such as wide gauge, insufficient rail cant, and loss of fastening toe load. Currently, the problem is not sufficiently understood to enable development of effective solutions. The primary causes of RSD appear to be high stresses at the rail seat, a loosened fastening system, the presence of moisture, and the presence of abrasive fines. RSD is considered to have up to six potential mechanisms, and this research investigates three of them: hydraulic pressure cracking, hydro-abrasive erosion, and cavitation erosion. A laboratory test apparatus and procedure were devised to measure the surface water pressure in a laboratory rail seat using tie pads of differing material composition and surface geometry. To evaluate hydraulic pressure cracking, a model of the effective stress in a concrete-tie rail seat was developed to estimate the water pressures on the rail seat surface and whether they could lead to damaging pore pressures in the concrete. Comparing the effective stress model and the measured surface water pressures, hydraulic pressure cracking appears to be a feasible mechanism for RSD given the correct combination of high rail seat loads, sufficient moisture, and a tie pad surface that develops high pressure. The measured surface water pressures were used to estimate the potential water velocity. By comparing these estimates with critical velocities for concrete erosion, it appears feasible that hydro-abrasive erosion contributes to RSD. The uplift action of the rail was simulated in the test apparatus, and the resulting suction was at or near the vapor pressure of water for most of the tie pads considered, suggesting that cavitation occurs in a concrete-tie rail seat. However, considering the size of the cavitation bubbles that could fit underneath the tie pad, and the observation that no high collapse pressures were measured, cavitation erosion is not a feasible mechanism for RSD. Mitigation options for preventing hydraulic pressure cracking are using a tie pad or pad assembly that does not <b>seal</b> <b>water,</b> reducing the occurrence of high impact loads, and using high-strength, air-entrained, low-permeability concrete. Care should be exercised when using pads that do not <b>seal</b> <b>water,</b> as this could contribute to hydro-abrasive erosion or abrasion...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fluid dynamic {{potentials}} {{are critical}} to the entrapment, distribution, phase, leakage and migration of hydrocarbons. The classification system combines two cap rock proper t ies (static and dynamic) wi th five seal and leakage modes (capillary seal, pressure seal, hydraulic resistance <b>seal,</b> <b>water</b> drive leakage and hydraulic fracturing leakage) and two hydrocarbon migration mechanisms {{into and out of}} a trap (fill/spill and fill/leak). Static cap rocks, such as thick shales, usually seal more than the vertical closure of the trap, {{as a consequence of the}} critical po re throat capillary pressure (capillary seal). In two-phase hydrocarbon systems fill/spill tends to concent ra te gas. Hydraulic fracturing is usually required to generate significant leakage through static cap rocks. Then fill/leak tends to concentra te oil. Dynamic cap rocks, such as inhomogeneous sand/shale sequences and faults have less sealing capacity than the static cap rocks, but are more widespread. They are strongly affected by variations in the fluid dynamic propert ies and are less dependen t on capillary pressure. Water potentials are often critical, for seal (pressure seal) or for leakage and redistribution (water drive leakage). Hydraulic resistance seal is important for trapping of oil and crucial for concentrat ion of oil relative to gas (fill/leak) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} to <b>seal</b> <b>water</b> in silver tubes {{for use in}} a TC/EA (thermal conversion/elemental analyzer) {{reduction}} unit using a semi-automated sealing apparatus can yield reproducibilities (1 standard deviation) of delta H- 2 and delta O- 18 measurements of 1. 0 parts per thousand and 0. 06 parts per thousand, respectively. These silver tubes containing reference waters may be preferred for the calibration of H- and O-bearing materials analyzed with a TC/EA reduction unit. The new sealing apparatus employs a computer-controlled stepping motor to produce silver tubes identical in length. The reproducibility of the mass of water sealed in tubes (in a range of 200 - 400 mu g) can be as good as 1 %. Approximately 99 % of the sealed silver tubes are satisfactory (leak free). Although silver tubes sealed with reference waters are robust and can be shaken or heated to 110 degrees C with no loss of integrity, they should not be frozen because the expansion during the phase transition of water to ice will break the cold seals and all the water will be lost. The tubes should be shipped in insulated containers. This new method eliminates air inclusions and isotopic fractionation of water associated with the loading of water into capsules using a syringe. The method is also more than an order of magnitude faster than preparing water samples in ordinary Ag capsules. Nevertheless, some laboratories may prefer loading water into silver capsules because expensive equipment is not needed, but users of this method are cautioned to apply the necessary corrections for evaporation, back exchange with laboratory atmospheric moisture, and blanks.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In a water-wet {{petroleum}} reservoir with a water-wet seal, {{a continuous}} water phase will extend from the reservoir into the seal, {{and the pressure}} diVerence between the water phase in the uppermost pores of the reservoir and the water phase in the lowermost pores of the seal can therefore only be of an infinitesimal magnitude. This implies that any overpressure in a water-wet reservoir will not contribute to pushing the hydrocarbons through a water-wet seal, and overpressured water-wet reservoirs should therefore not be considered more prone to capillary leakage than normally pressured reservoirs. Within a water-wet petroleum reservoir, the overpressure in the hydrocarbon phase relative to the water phase is balanced by the elastic forces at the fluid interface (interfacial tension). The overpressure in the hydrocarbon phase relative to the water phase therefore does not {{increase the risk of}} hydrofracturing the reservoir’s seal. This implies that the risk of hydrofracturing should not be increased as a function of hydrocarbon column height, and should not be considered to be higher for gas than it is for oil. When an upward-directed hydraulic gradient is present from a reservoir unit into the overlying <b>seal,</b> <b>water</b> will continuously move upwards from the reservoir unit and into the seal if both rocks are water-wet. This movement of water may lead to exsolution of gas above the reservoir unit, and the presence of free gas may be detected as gas chimneys on seismic sections. This mechanism will operate {{regardless of whether or not}} a hydrocarbon accumulation is present below the gas chimneys, and fracturing of the reservoir unit’s seal or capillary leakage of hydrocarbons are therefore not necessary conditions for the development of gas chimneys...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal for}} this thesis is to {{minimize}} clearances and tolerances, {{in order to}} prevent water leakage. A proper seal on the seal rings does not let excess water flow through the turbine runner, thus conserving more water and wasting less energy. Moreover, water leakage past worn wear plates allows for an extra load for the turbine when operating in condense mode. When the wicket gates are closed, water leakage past worn plates wastes mechanical energy in the water; thus, decreasing the efficiency of the Francis turbine, especially when operating at partial loads. Furthermore, the wicket gates also known as guide vanes can increase the efficiency of the turbine in their relation to their laminar profile and proper <b>seal.</b> <b>Water</b> is a very vital resource in today 2 ̆ 7 s society.

This study provides actual examples of improvements using the generating units located at Hoover Dam. Hoover Dam located in Boulder City, NV is part of the Lower Colorado Region, of the U. S.

40|$|Rivalry over {{river water}} {{resources}} {{has been a}} constant theme in the international politics of the South Asian region ever since the British Raj ended in 1947. Indeed, hardly had independence been gained when the competing claims of India and Pakistan to the waters of the Indus river basin helped bring on the first war between them over Kashmir (1947 - 1949). Nearly a decade of arduous World Bank-facilitated negotiations resulted finally in the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a landmark agreement that succeeded in resolving the question of Indus waters ownership by getting Indian and Pakistani consent to the permanent division of the six rivers of the Indus system. That formula, perhaps suitable enough for then, strikes some as an ill fit for now. After all, much has changed in the sixty-odd years that have passed since independence. The South Asian region has experienced more than a tripling of its population; and it has also undergone the massive social and economic changes that go along with industrialization and urbanization. Inevitably, these things have brought it under vastly increased pressures on water availability for agricultural and other uses. Acute fresh water scarcity now ranks among the most pressing domestic problems faced by Pakistan, and it is scarcely less pressing for large parts of India and Bangladesh as well. Exacerbated by equally acute power shortages in these countries (a development attracting attention to the region’s vast hydroelectric potential), their water resource-related disputes are already among the most nettlesome issues on their bilateral agendas. This is no less true of India-Bangladesh relations, which are bedeviled by the failure of their governments to <b>seal</b> <b>water</b> sharing agreements on any but one of the 54 rivers India and Bangladesh share in common, than it is of India-Pakistan relations. True, the near-term likelihood of war erupting in the region as a direct consequence of these disputes is slight; but that the region’s water rivalries are already fraying tempers, deepening distrust, and, in myriad ways, acting as conflict multipliers cannot be denied. Added to this, of course, is that neighboring China’s own extreme fresh water scarcity and its much-magnified interest in tapping into Tibet’s rich water resources hover threateningly over South Asian water supplies. Tibet’s water resources include the Brahmaputra river, already of unquestionably crucial importance to Bangladesh and India. With China now beginning to weigh in on the scales of South Asia’s water security, the potential for serious confrontation over water resources is heightened still further. Increased basin-wide cooperation over these resources is one possible—and, indeed, highly desirable—outcome of these developments. One highly undesirable—but perhaps no less possible—outcome, of course, is water war...|$|E
