25|$|After Miers {{failed in}} these private meetings, Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Sam Brownback began {{drafting}} a letter asking the President's office {{to turn over}} legal memoranda and briefs Miers had written for Bush, in order to elucidate her views on political matters. Brownback and Graham knew the memos were protected by executive privilege, that the White House was not required to turn them over, and that Miers could refuse to deliver the memos and then ostensibly step down on principle. Miers would later use this request {{as part of a}} face-saving exit strategy for stepping down. In her letter withdrawing her nomination, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the senators' request for confidential documents as potentially damaging the executive branch's independence.|$|E
25|$|Robin is Eva Kane's son, Evelyn, {{which in}} England {{can be a}} man's name {{as well as a}} woman's. Mrs Upward had not known who was the mother of her adopted son, but he {{realised}} that any scandal would be to his detriment. Mrs McGinty saw the photo of Eva Kane while working at the Upward house and assumed the photo was of Mrs Upward as a young woman. Robin killed her to prevent her from telling anyone who might recognise the photo, and framed Bentley by stealing the £30, correctly assuming Bentley would incriminate himself by panicking. Mrs Upward thought Kane's photograph to be similar to a photo Robin had shown her of his mother, whose back story he made up. She wanted to confront Robin by herself, so <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the wrong photo (that of Lily Gamboll) to put Poirot off the scent.|$|E
25|$|Following his wife's death, {{he began}} discerning a {{vocation}} {{to join a}} monastery, perhaps in France. One day, while discussing his vocation with the sister of Thomas Hussey, the Bishop of Waterford, a band of ragged boys passed by. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> them, and cried:"What! Would you bury yourself in a cell on the continent rather than devote your wealth and your life to the spiritual and material interest of these poor youths?"After settling his business affairs in 1802, Rice {{devoted his life to}} prayer and charitable work, particularly with the poor and marginalised of Waterford. In 1802, when he established a makeshift school in a converted stable in New Street, Waterford, he found the children were so difficult to manage that the teachers resigned. This prompted him to sell his thriving business to another prominent Roman Catholic merchant, a Mr. Quan, and devote himself to training teachers who would dedicate their lives to prayers and to teaching the children free of charge. Despite the difficulties involved, Edmund's classes were so popular that another temporary school had to be set up on another of his properties, this time in nearby Stephen Street.|$|E
40|$|The author, an {{obstetrician}} and gynecologist, {{relates the}} differences {{she has seen}} in birth delivery procedures between the time of giving birth to her first child in 1968 and her last, in 1991. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the increase in choices allowed to women in labor, such as use of analgesics or whether {{to go ahead with}} a caesarean or not, left <b>to</b> the woman. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the pressure on mother and child to leave the hospital after one day, or two at most.

500|$|In 2008, The New York Times {{wrote that}} the movie had defined {{the image of a}} {{personal}} assistant in the public mind. Seven years later, Dissents Francesca Mari wrote about [...] "the assistant economy" [...] by which many creative professionals rely on workers so titled to do menial personal and professional tasks for them; <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> The Devil Wears Prada as the best-known narrative of assistantship. The next year, writing about a proposed change in U.S. federal overtime regulations that was seen as threatening to that practice, the Times called it the Devil Wears Prada economy", a term other news outlets also used.|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor's {{confirmation}} hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on July 13, 2009, {{during which she}} backed away from her [...] "wise Latina" [...] remark, declaring it [...] "a rhetorical flourish that fell flat" [...] and stating that [...] "I {{do not believe that}} any ethnic, racial or gender group has an advantage in sound judgment." [...] When Republican senators confronted her regarding other remarks from her past speeches, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> her judicial record and said she had never let her own life experiences or opinions influence her decisions. Republican senators said that while her rulings to this point might be largely traditional, they feared her Supreme Court rulings – where there is more latitude with respect to precedent and interpretation – might be more reflective of her speeches. Sotomayor defended her position in Ricci as following applicable precedent. [...] When asked whom she admired, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo. In general, Sotomayor followed the hearings formula of recent past nominees by avoiding stating personal positions, declining to take positions on controversial issues likely to come before the Court, agreeing with senators from both parties, and repeatedly affirming that as a justice she would just apply the law. [...] On July 28, 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Sotomayor's nomination; the 13–6 vote was almost entirely along party lines, with no Democrats opposing her and only one Republican supporting her. On August 6, 2009, Sotomayor was confirmed by the full Senate by a vote of 68–31. [...] The vote was largely along party lines, with no Democrats opposing her and nine Republicans supporting her.|$|E
500|$|... {{definitely}} {{paved the}} way for the filmmakers and distributors of the world to know that there was a female audience that was really strong out there", Gabler recalls, one that was not segmented by age. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> later movies, such as Mamma Mia!, 27 Dresses (written by McKenna) and Me Before You, that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Pradas success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well. [...] "Prada reminds me of movies that we don't have a lot of now—it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ... You just keep wanting to find something that can touch upon the same zeitgeist as this film." ...|$|E
5000|$|The book {{encompasses}} {{a critique of}} multiculturalism, alleged weak policing, cultural relativism and what Phillips calls a [...] "victim culture". She argues that these forces combined to create an ideal breeding ground for Islamic terrorists. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the centrality of London-based individuals and groups to many terror plots around the world, which she argues were enabled by a semi-formal [...] "covenant of security" [...] between Islamists and the British authorities. Zacharias Moussaoui and the shoe-bomber Richard Reid are two of many such examples <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> in the book.|$|R

500|$|Hill {{experienced}} discrimination {{throughout her}} climbing career {{and in an}} interview with John Stieger in Climbing, she pointed out that despite her success and prowess at climbing, this was a problem for her. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> sexist remarks from male climbers who believed particular routes were impossible for female climbers and the fact that [...] "there's a lot less importance and prestige placed on women in climbing, no matter what your ability is". Hill has also commented extensively about how American culture encourages women to be passive and to forego developing muscles, which makes it harder for them to excel at climbing. She lamented this trend and was happy that her family and friends had allowed her to be the [...] "tomboy" [...] she wanted to be. Hill has explained that when competing she is not competing against men or women but with people's expectations of what women can do.|$|E
500|$|Commentators had a mixed {{reaction}} to the choice of Kelly as Nivea's duet partner. Nicole James of Fuse ranked [...] "Laundromat" [...] {{as one of the}} top six most random Kelly collaborations. While James cast doubt on the effectiveness of the laundromat as a metaphor, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> Kelly's vocal performance during the chorus as the song's highlight. However, Laura Checkoway viewed the [...] "banter between the barely legal Nivea and Kelly [...] unsettling" [...] because of the allegations that he had sexual relationships with girls under the age of consent. Echoing this thought, writer Mark Anthony Neal agreed with Checkoway's assessment in his 2010 article [...] "Bringing Up Daddy: A Black Feminist Fatherhood". Neal wrote that he was uncomfortable with the thought of taking his daughter to concerts that included [...] "music written and produced by a man accused of having sexual relations with underage women".|$|E
500|$|Modern Vampires of the City is a {{departure}} from the percussive, African-influenced indie pop of Contra. Batmanglij said that the album has a recurring tension that distinguishes it from the band's previous albums: [...] "Even if the songs are mostly in a major key, there’s something that’s hanging out there that’s a little bit dark. And I think that’s reflective of the world." [...] According to Heather Phares of AllMusic, the album abandoned the eclectic influences of Contra in favor of [...] "a less audacious production style and smaller instrumental palette: guitar, organ, harpsichord, and the occasional sample combine into a rarefied sound that suggests a more insular version of their debut". <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> how the album is bookended by the stylistically narrow chamber pop on the songs [...] "Obvious Bicycle" [...] and [...] "Young Lion". [...] "Step" [...] was inspired by a lyric from Souls of Mischief's 1993 song [...] "Step to My Girl", which sampled Grover Washington, Jr.'s cover of Bread's [...] "Aubrey". The vocal melody of the chorus interprets the melody of [...] "Aubrey" [...] so close that the band had to clear it as a sample. The chorus vocals were recorded in Ableton Live using the onboard microphone in Batmanglij's MacBook Pro. Alexis Petridis viewed that some songs echo lesser known [...] "musical tropes" [...] from the group's previous albums—a mock Irish folk influence is heard on [...] "Unbelievers", while [...] "Step" [...] features [...] "Left Banke-inspired baroque pop".|$|E

She also noted that General Rudenko, the chief Soviet prosecutor, after the trials became commandant of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp.

2500|$|Although Connecticut is {{considered}} a solid Democratic-voting state, McMahon and Simmons sought {{to capitalize on the}} anti-establishment and anti-Democratic tide that had become a factor in the 2010 campaign season. In particular, Scott Brown's win in Massachusetts was seen as a good omen for Republicans nationally, as it showed that a Republican could win in a [...] "deep blue" [...] state. A key factor in Brown's win had been his demand for fiscal responsibility, which McMahon made her centerpiece issue, attacking Simmons for his voting record as U.S. Representative. In new mailings, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> Simmons' D-rating from the National Taxpayers Union.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a speech}} at the American University in Cairo in July 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice claimed that American {{intervention}} in Iraq had resulted in millions of Iraqis resisting terror and participating in democracy, and <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> developments in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, and Egypt as indicators of democracy's trajectory in the region. In one segment of her speech she outlined several aspects of the Bush administration's view of democratization in the region, including denying that democracy is being imposed from the outside, stressing that democracy would bring peace rather than chaos, pressing leaders in the region to commit to the democratization process, and asserting the incompatibility of terrorism and democracy: ...|$|E

She did not consider herself a [...] "new Indian", but an [...] "old Indian adjusted to new conditions". [...] Kellogg criticized Buffalo Bill Cody in New York for his [...] stereotypical performances of Indian people. In contrast to many members of the Society of American Indians, Kellogg wanted Indian children to include the wisdom of the elders and the reservation. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> tenement life in cities where [...] "hollow-chested" [...] men were forced to toil in shops closed to the wind and the sun.

2500|$|On April 7, 2004, however, Camile Velasco was {{eliminated}} from American Idol. [...] She, Diana DeGarmo and Jasmine Trias, a fellow Filipino-American from Hawaii, {{had received the}} fewest votes during Elton John week. However, DeGarmo was saved first and the remaining 2 Hawaiian girls were asked to perform one last time before Ryan Seacrest revealed the night’s results. [...] Mostly due to increasingly harsh criticisms from the judges, Velasco seemed to anticipate her departure. [...] As a result, {{she became the first}} contestant to alter the lyrics of her song impromptu, substituting “the blues” with “I love you,” as <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> her fans in the audience and her fellow contestants, and replacing “back to the howling old owl in the woods” with “back to the island of Maui, at home.” [...] Velasco kept her composure as her name was announced, but began to cry during her dedication video.

She described The Element of Freedom as diverse, but noted {{that there is a}} [...] "balance". She explained that [...] "one side is strong and one side is vulnerable", which <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> as the theme of the album. The album has a [...] "strong, edgy feel", but is also [...] "intimate and vulnerable and delicate". While on BET's 106 & Park, she described the album: [...] "The way that the songs progress [...] are gonna take you on a natural high. I just want you to feel a sense of freedom, I want you to feel out-of-the-box, feel inspired, You're definitely going to be taken on a trip, I know you're going to be shocked, you're going to hear things that you probably didn't think that I would sound like.
