500|$|Andrew Tran of {{the website}} Overmental, {{on the other}} hand, reacted more {{positively}} to the episode. He felt that both King Huge and Seven were representative of a stagnation in mindset; according to him, they are both stuck in their ways and unwilling to change. However, {{he notes that the}} two also differ substantially. Tran argues that King Huge has legions of <b>slaves</b> <b>feeding</b> him the richest of foods. He is comfortable, but unaccustomed to dealing with outsiders, which expresses itself as xenophobia. Seven, on the other hand, lives in abject poverty, and is much more welcoming of strangers. In the end, Seven escapes the episode unscathed, and according to Tran, the moral of the episode is that [...] "the bright side of a crap situation is that [...] pushes rather than restricts, enriches rather than fattens." ...|$|R

40|$|Feeding and {{drinking}} behavior were measured in rats maintained under a 12 : 12 light-dark (LD) cycle or skeleton photoperiod (SPP). Feeding {{and drinking}} were closely associated during the normal LD cycle but under SPP conditions an increased feeding activity during the subjective day was not {{accompanied by an}} equivalent increment of water intake. This indicates a stronger coupling of drinking to the subjective night. A restriction of food availability to the subjective light phase did not cause an accompanying complete shift in drinking behavior. These results suggest that drinking is largely dependent {{on the influence of}} a circadian oscillator and this association is not disrupted by changes in feeding schedule. A change in food access to the subjective light phase caused partial but not permanent desynchronization between feeding and drinking behavior. Synchrony was reestablished within one day once food was available ad lib. Complete return to the original feeding and drinking patterning took 3 days. It is suggested that separate <b>slave</b> oscillators controlling <b>feeding</b> and drinking are governed by a hypothesized "master" circadian oscillator which remains definitely entrained to the original rhythm by the light pulses of the SPP condition. ...|$|R
2500|$|Cod {{has been}} an {{important}} economic commodity in an international market since the Viking period (around AD800). Norwegians used dried cod during their travels, and soon a dried cod market developed in southern Europe. This market has lasted for more than 1,000 years, passing through periods of Black Death, wars and other crises and still is an important Norwegian fish trade. The Portuguese since the 15th century have been fishing cod in the North Atlantic, and clipfish is widely eaten and appreciated in Portugal. The Basques also {{played an important role in}} the cod trade and are claimed to have found the Canadian fishing banks before Columbus' discovery of America. The North American east coast developed in part due to the vast amount of cod, and many cities in the New England area spawned near cod fishing grounds. [...] New England profited greatly from the golden trade route between England, Africa, the West Indies, and New England in the 17th and 18th centuries. [...] New England cod went to England and then to the West Indies to <b>feed</b> <b>slaves</b> working in the sugar cane fields producing molasses for rum manufacture in Massachusetts and England to be used as payment for more slaves from West African slave traders to be used in the ever expanding sugar cane fields in the West Indies.|$|R

The next day, the witch prepares the oven for Hansel, but decides she is hungry enough to eat Gretel, too. She coaxes Gretel to the open oven and prods her to lean over in front of it to see if the fire is hot enough. Gretel, sensing the hag's intent, pretends she does not understand what she means. Infuriated, the hag demonstrates, and Gretel instantly shoves the hag into the oven, slams and bolts the door shut, leaving [...] "the ungodly creature to be burned to ashes", screaming in pain until she dies. Gretel frees Hansel from the cage and the pair discover a vase full of treasure and precious stones. Putting the jewels into their clothing, the children set off for home. A duck ferries them across an expanse of water and at home they find only their father; his wife died from an unknown cause. Their father had spent all his days lamenting the loss of his children, and is delighted to see them safe and sound. With the hag's wealth, they all live happily ever after.|$|R
40|$|One {{might think}} of the slave {{property}} system of provision grounds (or “provisioning”) in the West Indies as a happy coalition of interests between planters (who wanted to provide <b>slaves</b> incentives to <b>feed</b> themselves), Westminster (who wanted well-fed slaves to ensure the productivity of the sugar sector, a hefty tax contributor to the Exchequer), and slaves (who saw the advantages of a system which ensured that they were fed and encouraged private enterprise). Yet while this was generally true, notably, not {{all members of the}} plantocracy viewed these developments as positive. An outspoken minority feared that the roots of the ultimate failure of plantation society would lie in the slave provisioning system. Moreover, they pointed to the resistance of the plantocracy in the U. S. South to private enterprise among slaves as the preferable course. The views of this outspoken minority ultimately proved prescient, as a struggle over true ownership of provisioning plots played out against the backdrop of Emancipation in the British colonies. I focus on the era immediately after British Emancipation. During slavery planters were willing to grant slaves provisioning plots because the planters themselves exacted a benefit from doing so; they essentially “outsourced” the job of <b>feeding</b> the <b>slaves</b> to the slaves themselves. Once labor became free, this benefit vanished. Planters began to wonder how to handle ex-slaves farming provision grounds. Although provision grounds were de facto (perceived to be) slave property, typically these lands were instead de jure planter property (plots {{at the edge of the}} plantations for which the planters held title). The issue became particularly acute in the aftermath of Emancipation, when planters sought to “tie” former-slaves-turned-freedmen to the plantations to secure a reliable workforce. Newly freed, the former slaves had no obligation to accept planters’ “offers” of employment on the plantations. Property acquisition during slavery (when there were no formal protections) turned out to be singularly important in determining who continued to remain in the employ of the plantation post-Emancipation. The irony is that the extensive nature of the provisioning system (which acculturated slaves to a form of “property-and-contract-lite”) made it less likely that ex-slaves continued to remain in the employ of the planters once leaving became a viable choice. West Indian freedmen who already had a taste of property ownership were typically not enamored with long-term plantation employment. Following this logic, one might predict that planters in the U. S. South would ultimately prove more successful in maintaining a long-term plantation-like society (even after the abolition of slavery) than their West Indian counterparts because they never allowed provisioning to develop. This prediction is spot-on. In particular, the early demise of status relationships that undergirded plantation society in the West Indies had much to do with the general failure of share tenancy (and its most popular iteration, sharecropping) in the West Indies. In a system of sharecropping, a landowner allows a tenant to use the land in return for a share of the crops produced on the land. This significantly reduces the strain that up-front labor costs place on a plantation’s cash-flow. Although now most widely associated in the popular American imagination with the U. S. South, sharecropping has a long historical heritage that pre-dates Southern plantation society. Sharecropping was attractive to the West Indian planter for the same reason that it was attractive to the Southern planter – primarily as a mechanism of tying slaves to the plantations while saving on labor costs. In summary, both planters in the West Indies and the U. S. South sought to institutionalize sharecropping arrangements. But it is largely because of the provisioning system that West Indian planters fail in their efforts, while Southern planters succeed. West Indian slaves opted instead in large numbers to use the money that they had accumulated from contracting at food markets during slavery to buy their own land and become de jure property owners...|$|R
