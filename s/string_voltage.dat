50|$|It is also {{possible}} to measure the electrical characteristics of individual cells in a battery string, using intermediate sensor wires that are installed at every cell-to-cell junction, and monitored both individually and collectively. Battery strings may also be wired as series-parallel, for example two sets of 20 cells.

40|$|High tension {{insulators}} {{are generally}} built of several porcelain discs in series, the discs being connected by galvanized steel hardware. When alternating voltage is impressed across such a <b>string</b> the <b>voltage</b> is not distributed symmetrically because the charging current {{is not the}} same through the string. There is capacitance from each connector to the next, from each connector to the ground and to the line wire, as well as capacitance from one connector to one which is not adjacent. If the voltage impressed is direct and all the units or discs are exactly alike, then such an air insulator string would have across each unit the same value of voltage. A certain leakage current flows through each insulator, and the d. c. voltage across each unit will be the leakage current multiplied by the resistance of each unit. In the transmission of high-voltage direct current, such as the Thury system found in Europe, high-tension porcelain insulators can be used to insulate the line from the ground. Such insulators are exposed to changing weather conditions of humidity and temperature. Also, these insulators on account of being subjected to mechanical stresses, electrical stresses, and repeated temperature cycles, depreciate in resistance, become faulty, and unless detected may interfere with the operation of the transmission system. If the resistance of the insultors forming the string, and the effect produced on the resistance by temperature, humidity, etcetera, are known then it is possible to predict to a certain degree of approximation what service the insulators can give. Besides determining the condition of such insulators, a knowledge of the resistance would give a basis for comparing different types of insulators, and likewise would furnish a means for arriving at the voltage distribution of different makes and types and the uniformity with which a given type could be expected to run.

Tower with two OHGW was taken in this work. Back flash over mechanism is modeled and triggered to the existing system by an external control module with powerful electrical tool PSCAD/EMTDC. Metal Oxide transmission line arresters were used in this work as a solution for the back flashover. However, considering acceptable probabilistic failure as one outage per year per 100 km line length, and suggested basic insulation level (BIL) of 1050 KV, the arrester rating was calculated to be 196 KV and its parametric determination for a one column arrester with an overall length of 1. 45 meters is done. Simulation is carried out by placing line arresters in one phase and recovering the <b>string</b> <b>voltage</b> without interrupting power to the consumers...|$|E
