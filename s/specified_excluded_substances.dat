40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the presence of corpus callosum (CC) volume deficits in a population-based recent-onset psychosis (ROP) sample, and whether CC volume relates to interhemispheric communication deficits. For this purpose, we used voxel-based morphometry comparisons of magnetic resonance imaging data between ROP (n = 122) and healthy control (n = 94) subjects. Subgroups (38 ROP and 39 controls) were investigated for correlations between CC volumes and performance on the Crossed Finger Localization Test (CFLT). Significant CC volume reductions in ROP subjects versus controls emerged after <b>excluding</b> <b>substance</b> misuse and non-right-handedness. CC reductions retained significance in the schizophrenia subgroup but not in affective psychoses subjects. There were significant positive correlations between CC volumes and CFLT scores in ROP subjects, specifically in subtasks involving interhemispheric communication. From these results, we can conclude that CC volume reductions are present in association with ROP. The relationship between such deficits and CFLT performance suggests that interhemispheric communication impairments are directly linked to CC abnormalities in ROP. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} prevalence of psychiatric disorders, social and family {{risk factors for}} disorders, and met and unmet needs for mental health care among Appalachian youth. METHODS: All 9 -, 11 -, and 13 -year-old American Indian children in an 11 -county area of the southern Appalachians were recruited, together with {{a representative sample of}} the surrounding population of White children. RESULTS: Three-month prevalences of psychiatric disorders were similar (American Indian, 16. 7 %; White, 19. 2 %). Substance use was more common in American Indian children (9. 0 % vs 3. 8 % in White children), as was comorbidity of substance use and psychiatric disorder (2. 5 % vs 0. 9 %). American Indian poverty, family adversity (e. g., parental unemployment, welfare dependency), and family deviance (parental violence, substance abuse, and crime) rates were higher, but the rate of family mental illness, <b>excluding</b> <b>substance</b> abuse, was lower. Child psychiatric disorder and mental health service use were associated with family mental illness in both ethnic groups but were associated with poverty and family deviance only in White children. Despite lower financial barriers, American Indian children used fewer mental health services.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{define the}} {{prevalence}} of mental disorder and need for psychiatric treatment in new remand prisoners and to determine to what extent these are recognised and addressed in prison. DESIGN: Study of consecutive male remand prisoners at reception using a semistructured psychiatric interview. SETTING: Large remand prison for men (HMP Durham). SUBJECTS: 669 men aged 21 years and over on remand, awaiting trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of mental disorder at reception, prisoners need for psychiatric treatment, identification of mental disorder by prison reception screening, and numbers placed appropriately in the prison hospital. RESULTS: 148 (26 %) men had one or more current mental disorders (<b>excluding</b> <b>substance</b> misuse) including 24 who were acutely psychotic. The prison reception screening identified 34 of the men with mental disorder and six of those with acute psychosis. 168 men required psychiatric treatment, 50 of whom required urgent intervention; 16 required immediate transfer to psychiatric hospital.

40|$|Limited {{evidence}} shows that time-limited residential treatment (RT) is beneficial for homeless people with serious mental illness. The Department of Veterans Affairs has established 11 specialty programs for homeless female veterans. We present data comparing 1 -year clinical outcomes {{in a group of}} veterans who did and did not receive at least 30 days of RT. Clients of the Homeless Women Veterans Programs were invited to participate in a follow-up study. They were interviewed every 3 months for 1 year. Those who received at least 30 days of RT in the 3 months after program entry (RT group) were compared with other program participants (no or < 30 days RT [NRT] group) on measures of community functioning, psychiatric symptoms, and drug and alcohol use during the follow-up. The RT group had better outcomes on employment, social support, housing status, and psychiatric symptoms. They also had significantly increased use of drugs and alcohol compared with the NRT group.

Axis-I disorders were compared with police decisions regarding identification of mental illness based on their usual practices. Participants were classified as requiring referral for further mental health evaluation according to the screening tools. Results indicated that current police practices produced high false negatives, with many of those experiencing mental illness not identified.

40|$|Electroporation is the {{formation}} of permeabilizing structures in the cell membrane {{under the influence of}} an externally imposed electric field. The resulting increased permeability of the membrane enables a wide range of biological applications, including the delivery of normally <b>excluded</b> <b>substances</b> into cells. While electroporation is used extensively in biology, biotechnology, and medicine, its molecular mechanism is not well understood. This lack of knowledge limits the ability to control and fine-tune the process. In this article we propose a novel molecular mechanism for the electroporation of a lipid bilayer based on energetics analysis. Using molecular dynamics simulations we demonstrate that pore formation is driven by the reorganization of the interfacial water molecules. Our energetics analysis and comparisons of simulations with and without the lipid bilayer show that the process of poration is driven by field-induced reorganization of water dipoles at the water-lipid or water-vacuum interfaces into more energetically favorable configurations, with their molecular dipoles oriented in the external field. Although the contributing role of water in electroporation has been noted previously, here we propose that interfacial water molecules are the main players in the process, its initiators and drivers. The role of the lipid layer, to a first-order approximation, is then reduced to a relatively passive barrier. This new view of electroporation simplifies the study of the problem, and opens up new opportunities in both theoretical modeling of the process and experimental research to better control or to use it in new, innovative ways...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to screen for mental health {{problems}} in Australian Indigenous young people in a youth detention centre using the Westerman Aboriginal Symptoms Checklist â€“ Youth (WASC-Y). Over the study period, all Indigenous young people admitted into custody were referred for screening with the WASC-Y, a culturally validated fi vescaled instrument developed to identify Indigenous young people at risk for a range of mental health or substance abuse problems. The WASC-Y also incorporates a separate scale for cultural resilience. High levels of mental health and substance abuse problems were reported, with 94. 6 % of males and 100 % of females surveyed screening above the designated clinical cut-off on at least one scale. Based on moderate/medium levels of risk, 27. 7 % screened positive for depression, 34. 0 % for suicide ideation or intent, 89. 4 % for substance use, 36. 2 % for impulsivity, and 68. 1 % for symptoms of anxiety. Females screened higher than males across all fi ve subscales, though differences reached statistical signifi cance only for suicidal ideation or intent.

30|$|There are two {{additional}} limitations associated {{with our study}} that warrant discussion. Firstly, substance abuse in psychosis and bipolar disorder patients {{has been associated with}} changes in grey matter volumes that deviate from non-substance abuse psychosis (Lyoo et al. 2006 a) and bipolar disorder (Jarvis et al. 2008) patients. The selection criteria for this study <b>excluded</b> <b>substance</b> dependence, but future research examining the relationship between the level of substance use and cortical thinning may delineate the role that comorbidity of substances has with respect to these potential biomarkers of these disorders. Secondly, the impact of pharmacological therapy on cortical lamina remains a contentious issue, with recent research suggesting that antipsychotic treatment may contribute to changes to frontal and temporal lobe cortical thickness (Smieskova et al. 2009; Navari and Dazzan 2009) while others have reported no effects (Kuperberg et al. 2003; Narr et al. 2005 a; Nesvag et al. 2008). The correlation between increased mood stabiliser dosage and increased cortical thickness of the right precentral gyrus (25 % of variance) should be treated with caution given the small number of patients on this treatment (n = 28; 8 subjects were taking lithium and the remaining 20 subjects were taking anticonvulsants). This study was cross-sectional in design, so no clear picture can be gained {{about the ways in which}} medication influences cortical thinning over time within the same individuals. The apparent differences between different reported age groups for bipolar disorder or psychosis may reflect other factors including different selection criteria, different diagnostic thresholds and concurrent exposure to other factors such as alcohol or substance misuse or medications.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Incarcerated women, {{especially}} women in jail, {{are at high}} risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Research is needed to establish the key predictors of risk behavior, so that these can be targeted in interventions. Traumatic stress, substance use and intimate relationship dynamics likely influence infection and transmission risk among incarcerated women; however, these effects are not well understood. The author tested a model, based in Social Action Theory, of the effects of traumatic stress on condomless sex through the mediators of relational anxiety, relationship power, relationship closeness, and substance use. Jail-detained women who reported having a main sex partner in the three months prior to their arrest were interviewed (N = 205). The original model, accounting for 28 % of the variance in condomless sex, had acceptable fit and found evidence for the effects of all factors except substance use. A better fitting model that re-specified effects of relationship power leading to substance use and substance use leading to relationship closeness was also supported, with all paths significant. Finally, a simplified model <b>excluding</b> <b>substance</b> use was tested and demonstrated almost identical fit and beta values. Results suggest that traumatic stress among jail-detained women impacts condom use within main partnerships through divergent effects on closeness and power in the relationship. This may obscure the importance of traumatic stress on condomless sex when these pathways are omitted in statistical analyses. The results have compelling implications, but they require replication, especially given the limitations of cross-sectional data and retrospective reporting. Ultimately, interventions aimed at alleviating traumatic stress among women involved {{in the criminal justice system}} should consider evaluating relationship dynamics and sexual health practices...|$|R

40|$|Background: Currently, {{there is}} no {{consensus}} regarding how long antipsychotics medication should be continued following a first/single psychotic episode. Long-term maintenance therapy carries side-effects and may not be necessary for some patients. Clinically, patients often request discontinuation after a period of remission. This {{is one of the first}} double-blind randomized-controlled studies designed to address the issue. Methods: Patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia and related psychoses (<b>excluding</b> <b>substance</b> induced psychosis) who remitted well following a first/single-episode and had remained well on maintenance medication for 1 year were randomized to receive either maintenance therapy with quetiapine (400 mg/day), or placebo for 12 months. Relapse was defined by the presence of (i) an increase in at least one of the following Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) psychotic symptom items to a threshold score (delusion, hallucinatory behaviour, conceptual disorganization, unusual thought content, suspiciousness); (ii) Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity of Illness 3 or above and (iii) CGI Improvement 5 or above. Results: 178 patients were randomized. 144 patients completed the study (80. 9 %). The relapse rate was 35 % (31 / 89) for the maintenance group and 66 % (59 / 89) for the placebo group (log-rank test, Ï‡ 2 = 15. 858, p < 0. 001). Relapse was not related to age or gender. Other significant predictors of relapse include medication status, pre-morbid schizotypal traits, verbal memory and soft neurological signs. Conclusions: This study provides new data for relapse risks in remitted first-episode psychosis patients following 1 year of maintenance therapy. There is a substantial risk of relapse if medication is discontinued. Maintenance medication halves relapse rate. On the other hand, 34 % of patients discontinued medication and remained well. Explorations of potential predictors of relapse may help further to estimate risks so that an informed decision about medication discontinuation can be made.

40|$|The {{placenta}} serves, in part, as {{a barrier}} to <b>exclude</b> noxious <b>substances</b> from the fetus. In humans, a single-layered syncytium of polarized trophoblast cells and the fetal capillary endothelium separate the maternal and fetal circulations. P-glycoprotein is present in the syncytiotrophoblast throughout gestation, consistent with a protective role that limits exposure of the fetus to hydrophobic and cationic xenobiotics. We have examined whether members of the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family are expressed in term placenta. After screening a placenta cDNA library, partial clones of MRP 1, MRP 2, and MRP 3 were identified. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting studies demonstrated that MRP 2 was localized to the apical syncytiotrophoblast membrane. MRP 1 and MRP 3 were predominantly expressed in blood vessel endothelia with some evidence for expression in the apical syncytiotrophoblast. ATP-dependent transport of the anionic substrates dinitrophenyl-glutathione and estradiol- 17 -beta-glucuronide was also demonstrated in apical syncytiotrophoblast membranes. Given the cellular distribution of these transporters, we hypothesize that MRP isoforms serve to protect fetal blood from entry of organic anions and to promote the excretion of glutathione/glucuronide metabolites in the maternal circulation...|$|R
