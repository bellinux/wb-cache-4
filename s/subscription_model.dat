5|$|The software's Interactive Marketing Hub was {{released}} in 2010, when the software's user interface was re-done. It serves as the software's primary user interface for managing communications and content through different media. The Salesforce Marketing Cloud software is offered in a hosted, online <b>subscription</b> <b>model.</b> The company owns the CoTweet, Pardot, and iGoDigital tools. Its mobile features, {{as well as many}} of its workflow and collaboration tools, were released in July 2013.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} week of release, the PS3 version of A Realm Reborn placed second in Japan's sales charts, with 184,000 {{physical}} copies sold. In late October 2013, Square Enix announced that the game had one and a half million registrations. It was the 16th best selling personal computer game of 2013 in the United States. In Japan, the PlayStation 3 version was ranked 32 in sales, with 244,574 retail copies sold. Following an extremely poor fiscal year 2013, Square Enix executives commended the game's sales and subscriptions for its role in returning the company to profitability in 2014. As of July 2016, the game had over 6 million cumulative players, a figure which excludes free trial members. Yoshida has repeatedly emphasized that the robust success of A Realm Reborn was due to its traditional monthly <b>subscription</b> <b>model.</b> He sees the free-to-play model as an unreliable source of income predicated on devoting a lot of development resources to monthly consumable or cosmetic items in order to maintain profitability, leaving little time left for higher quality story and battle content. He also disclosed that over 80% of players are satisfied with the <b>subscription</b> <b>model</b> and theorized that this is due to players' confidence in a steady stream of quality content because of their subscription. With the traditional model, the player base grows over time as people see the game expand, unlike a free-to-play game which can boast a huge initial player base which changes dramatically in size and revenue from month to month. Yoshida has no plans to change to a free-to-play model in the near future.|$|E
5|$|A Steam {{version of}} the client was {{released}} on February 14, 2014. A beta for the PlayStation 4 version of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn debuted {{on the same day}} as the Japanese release of the console, February 22, 2014. Owners of the PlayStation 3 client were able upgrade to the digital PlayStation 4 client for free. A two-week free trial version first became available for PC on July 31, 2014, with PlayStation 3 and 4 versions following in December. This two-week limitation was removed in March 2017; free trial players can access all content up to level 35 with no time restrictions. The Chinese version, published and administrated by Shanda Games, premiered on August 29, 2014 featuring content through patch 2.16. It features separate servers from the other language versions of the game and a pay-per-hour micropayment billing system. The Korean version, distributed by Actoz Soft, launched in South Korea on August 14, 2015 with content from patch 2.2. This version carries a flexible <b>subscription</b> <b>model</b> with increments as low as 5 hours, similar to the Chinese release, up to 90 days, much like the traditional monthly payment plan.|$|E

50|$|An {{unlimited}} use {{subscription to}} a service for a fixed price {{is an advantage}} for consumers using those services frequently. However, {{it could be a}} disadvantage to a customer who plans to use the service frequently, but later does not. The commitment to paying for a package may have been more expensive than a single purchase would have been. In addition, <b>subscription</b> <b>models</b> increase the possibility of vendor lock-in, and consumers may find repeated payments to be onerous. Finally, <b>subscription</b> <b>models</b> often require or allow the business to gather substantial amounts of information from the customer (such as magazine mailing lists) and this raises issues of privacy.|$|R

25|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} generate revenue {{from a variety}} of activities related to the production and distribution of credit ratings. The sources of the revenue are generally the issuer of the securities or the investor. Most agencies operate under one or a combination of business models: the <b>subscription</b> <b>model</b> and the issuer-pays model. However, agencies may offer additional services using a combination of business models.|$|E
25|$|The {{newspaper}} entered India on 16 November 2007 {{with the}} launch of Mail Today, a 48-page compact size newspaper printed in Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida with a print run of 110,000 copies.

25|$|Under the <b>subscription</b> <b>model,</b> {{the credit}} rating agency {{does not make}} its ratings freely {{available}} to the market, so investors pay a subscription fee for access to ratings. This revenue provides {{the main source of}} agency income, although agencies may also provide other types of services. Under the issuer-pays model, agencies charge issuers a fee for providing credit rating assessments. This revenue stream allows issuer-pays credit rating agencies to make their ratings freely available to the broader market, especially via the Internet.|$|E

40|$|In {{a digital}} environment, the {{traditional}} roles of authors and publishers change. The shift {{of power from}} authors, publishers and/or content to the platform affects {{the development of new}} business models, and shaping the content in the digital environment becomes a major challenge for publishers. The <b>subscription</b> <b>models</b> of the content sale have long been present in other media industries. Editing, design and marketing are the key features that a publisher develops and adapts to changes. The traditional skills of publishers are no longer sufficient. Instead, a continued integration of innovative solutions is needed. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore how the emergence of <b>subscription</b> <b>models</b> influences the development of new publishing products which bring together the author and the publisher in a joint effort to reach a larger number of readers...|$|R

25|$|Critics {{argue that}} the issuer-pays model creates a {{potential}} conflict of interest because the agencies are paid by the organizations whose debt they rate. However, the <b>subscription</b> <b>model</b> is also seen to have disadvantages, as it restricts the ratings' availability to paying investors. Issuer-pays CRAs have argued that subscription-models can also be subject to conflicts of interest due to pressures from investors with strong preferences on product ratings. In 2010 Lace Financials, a subscriber-pays agency later acquired by Kroll Ratings, was fined by the SEC for violating securities rules {{to the benefit of}} its largest subscriber.|$|E
25|$|Software as {{a service}} (SaaS) is “software that is owned, {{delivered}} and managed remotely {{by one or more}} providers.” (Gartner 2007) Additionally, SaaS applications are based on a single set of common code and data definitions. They are consumed in a one-to-many model, and SaaS uses a Pay As You Go (PAYG) model or a <b>subscription</b> <b>model</b> that is based on usage. Providers of SaaS do not necessarily own the computing resources themselves, which are required to run their SaaS. Therefore, SaaS providers may draw upon the utility computing market. The utility computing market provides computing resources for SaaS providers.|$|E
25|$|Having {{developed}} Stardock Central to digitally distribute its own PC titles, {{the company}} launched a service called Drengin.net in summer 2003. The original {{idea was that}} users would pay a yearly subscription fee and receive new titles as they became available. Initially, Stardock's own titles along with titles from Strategy First were available. A year later, Stardock replaced the <b>subscription</b> <b>model</b> with a new system called TotalGaming.net in which users could purchase games individually or pay an upfront fee for tokens which allowed them to purchase games at a discount. TotalGaming.net targeted independent game developers rather than the larger publishers. In late 2008, new token purchases were discontinued.|$|E

The Literatum platform was {{integrated with the}} Metapress platform to include website development tools, content targeting, rapid product creation, <b>subscription</b> <b>modeling,</b> eCommerce, and analytics.|$|R
50|$|<b>Subscription</b> <b>models</b> {{might also}} create the {{opposite}} effect. This can be illustrated by subscribing to a service for mowing lawns. The {{effective use of}} a single mower increases when mowing for a collection of homes, instead of every family owning their own lawnmower which are not used {{as much as the}} service providing mower, the use of resources for producing lawnmowers therefore decreases while lawns stay cut.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, many MMOs transitioned to the free-to-play model from subscriptions, {{including}} subscription-based games such as , , Dungeons & Dragons Online, and Champions Online. This {{move from a}} subscription based model to a free-to-play one has proven very beneficial in some cases. Star Wars: The Old Republic {{is a good example}} of a game that transitioned from subscription to free-to-play. Turbine as of September 10, 2010 has given an F2P with Cash shop option to The Lord of the Rings Online which resulted in a tripling of profit. Sony Online Entertainment's move to transition EverQuest from a <b>subscription</b> <b>model</b> into a hybrid F2P/subscription game was followed by a 125% spike in item sales, a 150% up-tick in unique log-ins, and over three times as many account registrations.|$|E
500|$|The Free Play {{program was}} {{originally}} set to last one year, but its length {{has been extended}} every year since its creation. As of April 2017, the free to play program still exists.

[...] In January 2008, Funcom rebranded their <b>subscription</b> <b>model</b> as a [...] "tier subscription system", adding a third options for customers to access to the game.

On Valentine's Day 2002, founder Rob Malda proposed to longtime girlfriend Kathleen Fent using {{the front page of}} Slashdot. They were married on December 8, 2002, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Slashdot implemented a paid subscription service on March 1, 2002.

5000|$|Unlike other marketplaces OnBuy {{operates}} on a <b>subscription</b> business <b>model</b> [...] The principle {{theory of the}} <b>subscription</b> business <b>model</b> is that charging sellers a subscription rather than commission means that sellers can {{lower the cost of}} products listed on OnBuy, due to the decrease in cost per sale (compared with marketplaces using a per-sale commission model), making products cheaper for customers while enabling the seller to make more margin.|$|R
