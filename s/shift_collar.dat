40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Ungulate {{behavior}} {{has been studied}} extensively but direct observation of free-ranging animals {{over long periods of}} time and large geographic areas is often prohibitively difficult. Improved technology, such as GPS collars fitted with motion-sensitive activity monitors, provides researchers with a potential tool to remotely collect fine scale activity and location data. Activity monitors record animal movement along one or more axes with different amounts of motion presumably corresponding to different animal behaviors. Inter- and intraspecific variations in motion among behaviors necessitate calibration for each focal species. Calibration generally consists of making detailed behavioral observations of captive collared animals and then pairing observed behaviors with collar activity data for the same sampling interval. This process results in a mathematical model that can be used to classify the activity level or behavior of novel free-ranging animals using remotely collected collar data. During the calibration process, we discovered that several factors associated with the time-keeping mechanisms of these collars can result in mismatches between collar activity monitor data and direct behavior observation. This results in inaccurate classification models. To correct for these timing errors, we used defined breaks in animal behavior to <b>shift</b> <b>collar</b> output times, improving the average correct classification rate up to 61. 7 percentage points for specific behaviors. We also learned that timing errors can be minimized by activating a collar's GPS unit, increasing the GPS fix rate, and using a sampling interval divisible by 8 seconds. Awareness and management of collar timing issues will enable managers and researchers to best classify animal behavior when using these collars and interpreting data from free-ranging animals. No activity monitor calibration had been conducted for Lotek 4400 GPS collars featuring dual-axis activity monitors for Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), or cattle (Bos taurus). We used discriminant function models to determine what behaviors can be accurately classified using these collars. Additionally, we constructed models using only pure intervals (sampling intervals during which only one behavior occurred) and applied them to datasets containing only mixed intervals (sampling intervals during which > 1 behavior occurred) to determine the effect of excluding the latter from the calibration process. Final full-dataset models accurately classified (correct classification rates > 70 %) up to 4 behavior categories for elk, 3 for deer, and 2 for cattle. Our results showed that classification models constructed with only pure intervals can result in misclassification rates of up to 61 % for mixed intervals of some behaviors. When remotely collecting data, researchers must balance sampling frequency with the battery life of the recording device. The duration of each behavior relative to sampling interval length might play an important role in activity monitor calibration. To date no efforts have been made to determine the optimal sampling interval duration to use with these sensors. Similarly, Lotek 4500 GPS collars featuring accelerometer activity monitors had not been calibrated for Rocky Mountain elk. We examined discriminant function model structures for 3 sampling interval durations (5 -min, 152 -sec, and 64 sec) to determine what behaviors can be accurately classified for animals with and without access to supplemental feed in the form of hay. Models constructed using 5 -min sampling intervals performed best, accurately classifying (≥ 70 % classification rate) up to 5 behaviors for animals without access to supplemental feed and 4 behavior categories for those with access to supplemental feed. All of our calibration models will be made available on-line, allowing managers and researchers to interpret data from novel free-ranging animals for use in ongoing and future studies of ungulate ecology and management...|$|E

50|$|In the novel, Graham {{introduced}} rigid wooden horse collars to Makassar {{to improve}} the efficiency of her commissary with {{the limited number of}} horses she had. Although this seemed like a trivial improvement, this was a disruptive technology on Makassar, because Makassar society still used slaves as draft animals. Makassar could not exploit the full ability of horses with its current technology: simple harnesses fastened around the neck. Each horse eats as much as five men and so must perform better than five men to be worth using, but it could not with a simple harness. However, with a wooden <b>collar</b> <b>shifting</b> the pulled weight to its shoulders, a horse could pull ten times as much as a man at high speed. The effect of this would be either to render a large number of slaves useless, or to free them for other uses. Either way, the economic structure of the society would change radically, and with it the political and power structure.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} {{the study of the}} occupational structure of Ukrainian society, in particular, of the distribution of the population of Ukraine by occupational groups (which were derived according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations ISCO- 88). The statistical data demonstrates that a significant dynamics of occupational differentiation of Ukrainian population took place during the last twelve years, namely a <b>shift</b> from blue <b>collar</b> occupations in the industrial sector to the sphere of trade and services. The comparative data of the ESS project indicates a principal similarity of occupational differentiation of the post-socialist societies in contrast to the Western countries (particularly, the volume of the white collar positions in the occupational composition in the West is considerably higher, while for the blue collars it is correspondingly lower). The received data points out the importance of the determinants of gender and age for the analysis of the occupational structure of post-soviet societies. The author reveals the patterns of both the horizontal and the vertical gender segregation. The peculiarity of the occupational positions of different age groups lies in the so-called age "edge effect": the youngest (below 20 years old) and the oldest (above 60) groups have a specific occupational structure against the middle groups...|$|R
40|$|In 1969, Indonesia {{established}} a national family planning programme and total fertility has declined rapidly since {{but there is}} little consensus over the relative contribution of family planning to the observed decline. The first chapter constructs a new measure of family planning exposure to examine the role of family planning in reducing fertility. The causal effects of infant mortality is also examined based on a new instrumental variable, water supply and sanitation programme exposure, and that of schooling using father’s schooling as an instrument. The findings strongly indicate that family planning contributes to lower fertility together with reductions in infant deaths and improvements in women’s schooling, and that the effects of family planning and decreases in infant mortality are larger than that of schooling. In 2002, nearly one-in-ten men and more than one-in-five women in Indonesia were overweight and noncommunicable diseases had become the main cause of death but there exists no evidence on the causal effect of schooling on BMI for developing countries. The second chapter assesses whether more schooling causes healthier BMI in Indonesia by using two instrumental variables to capture exogenous variation in schooling. The first instrument takes advantage of the primary school construction programme (SD INPRES) in the 1970 s; the second instrument is father’s schooling. Two results stand out: more schooling causes higher BMI for men and there is no causal effect of schooling on BMI for women. This chapter also provides some very preliminary evidence that the <b>shift</b> from blue <b>collar</b> to white collar and service sector occupations is one contributing factor to why more schooling increases BMI for men. The third chapter also uses the SD INPRES programme but to examine the effect of increased school supply on schooling attainment: overall, by gender, and by socioeconomic background. It also constructs a new SD INPRES programme exposure variable as an instrument for schooling to assess the causal effect of schooling on wages. The results strongly suggest that the SD INPRES programme increased schooling for men and women but that women benefited more as did individuals from less advantageous socioeconomic backgrounds. More schooling also causes higher wages and there appears to be an added positive effect for women through the additional schooling induced by the SD INPRES programme...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the question of}} whether climate change is affecting the migration patterns of geese in the Pacific Flyway, specifically cackling geese (Branta hutchinsii minima) and Pacific white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis). Ancillary questions that are considered are as follows: • If global warming is affecting these species, {{what is the nature of}} the effects? • How are the changes affecting the human environment and what can be done about these effects? In 1994, the majority of the cackler population in the Pacific Flyway began to winter in Oregon’s Willamette Valley rather than in their historical wintering areas in California’s Central Valley. In recent years, the Pacific white-fronted goose has shown a change in behavior similar to that of cacklers just before their major shift. The reasons for this shift have not been clear, though climate change, agricultural shifts, or competition with other species were thought to be possible causes. Analyses of historical breeding and wintering surveys, bird band data, harvest data, agricultural data, and climate and weather data were undertaken in the course of this thesis to see if the cause or causes could be identified. The results showed that climate and weather data, i. e. an increase in average annual temperature coupled with occasional severe winters, most closely correlated with the cacklers’ shift northward. The data comparison revealed that there is a direct relationship between cacklers and a warming shift seen on the wintering grounds. There also was a secondary correlation between the northward shift and recent changes in agricultural crops in the Willamette Valley. Substantially less data are available for white-fronts, and the relationship between their recent migration changes and climate and/or other factors is much less clear. The following recommendations for management and further study are aimed at more completely understanding the scope and causes of migration shifts and formulating well-founded management plans for geese in the Pacific Flyway: • Continue research to determine if climate change is causing changes in goose population numbers and behavior. • Expand breeding ground flight surveys to include cacklers and habitat preference to learn how habitat change on the Y-K Delta is altering cackler behavior and breeding success. • Expand radio transmitter studies and collar programs for cacklers in Oregon and Washington to verify northerly wintering <b>shifts.</b> • Expand <b>collar</b> programs for cacklers wintering in the Willamette Valley to determine if the population is continuing to shift northward. • Expand banding programs for white-fronted geese to gather more data about migration patterns. • Develop models that will allow researchers and managers to correlate migration behavior with various environmental factors including climate change in order to: 1) determine which factors are causing migration changes in specific waterfowl populations and 2) allow managers to make changes to management plans in advance of rapid changes. • Inform the public about how it can assist in collar surveys or volunteer for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). This will enable USFWS to have more concrete data and give the public an opportunity gain a greater understanding of geese and goose management. • Expand research on urban cackling geese to determine the nature and scope of their effect on the human environment and to devise management strategies. • Research energetics in migrating geese to determine whether the shift in migration patterns has its basis in climate change. • Increase data exchange and coordination among agencies. • Formulate and implement plans at the city and county levels to manage growing numbers of geese in urban areas. • Recognize and anticipate the possibility that goose populations may move into new wintering areas and formulate plans for management of those species. • Implement low cost techniques, such as more liberal bag limits and seasons, hazing, etc., to assist agricultural landowners in decreasing goose-related crop damage...|$|R
