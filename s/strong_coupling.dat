25|$|This beta {{function}} {{tells us}} that the coupling increases with increasing energy scale, and QED becomes strongly coupled at high energy. In fact, the coupling apparently becomes infinite at some finite energy, resulting in a Landau pole.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the advantages of}} a <b>strong</b> <b>coupled</b> formulation derived from the energy to model the electro-mechanical coupling appearing in MEMS. Usually classical softwares use a staggered methodology iterating between two different codes to obtain {{the solution of the}} coupled problem. Others use some additional links between the two fields to obtain a <b>stronger</b> <b>coupling.</b> In this research a <b>strong</b> <b>coupled</b> formulation derived from the total energy of the problem is proposed and has been presented by the author in paper. 1 In this approach a new formulation of the electrostatic force is obtained and an analytical expression of the tangent stiffness matrix of the whole problem is derived. It has also been shown that this formulation of electrostatic forces provides a better convergence around corner. 2 This paper will highlight the advantage to use this method in static, modal and dynamic simulation. Indeed using the tangent stiffness matrix, nonlinear algorithms such as the Riks-Crisfield algorithm may be applied to solve the static nonlinear problem and determine accurately the static pull-in voltage. Moreover, the natural frequencies may be easily computed around each equilibrium positions. The dynamic behaviour of the structure may also be studied and two characteristic parameters are computed: the dynamic pull-in voltage and the dynamic pull-in time. This <b>strong</b> <b>coupled</b> methodology deriving from variational principle may also be used for topology optimisation and extended finite elements. Peer reviewe...|$|R

25|$|String {{models of}} {{confinement}} and hadrons {{have a long}} history. They were first invented to explain certain aspects of crossing symmetry in the scattering of two mesons. They were also found to be useful {{in the description of}} certain properties of the Regge trajectory of the hadrons. These early developments took on {{a life of their own}} called the dual resonance model (later renamed string theory). However, even after the development of QCD string models continued to play a role in the physics of strong interactions. These models are called non-fundamental strings or QCD strings, since they should be derived from QCD, as they are, in certain approximations such as the <b>strong</b> <b>coupling</b> limit of lattice QCD.|$|E

500|$|In {{opposition}} to the mainshock that was located onshore, the two large strike-slip aftershocks occurred the following morning (12:41a.m. and 4:18a.m. PDT) and were located offshore, [...] {{to the west of}} the main shock within the Gorda Plate. Both shocks (M6.5 and 6.6) were of intensity VIII (Severe), occurred at a depth of , and exhibited right-lateral motion. Of the several thousand aftershocks in the sequence, none were found to have occurred on the Mendocino Fracture Zone, but numerous events were located on the eastward projection of that fault. The mainshock's rupture duration was described as a smooth nine seconds, while the two aftershocks had more complex and slightly longer ruptures of 14–15 seconds. That the two strike-slip events followed a thrust event indicated a <b>strong</b> <b>coupling</b> of stresses at the North American and Gorda plate boundaries, and underscored the convoluted nature of the interconnected faults in that area.|$|E

For weak coupling where the spectrum is shifted very little away from the ideal gas case, a sum-rule approach is shown to work well. For <b>stronger</b> <b>coupling,</b> the interplay between the single particle and the collective excitations causes effects such as mode splitting and Landau damping.

2500|$|In general, {{the result}} of an orbital {{operator}} acting on vibronic states can be replaced by an effective orbital operator acting on purely electronic states. In first order, the effective orbital operator equals the actual orbital operator multiplied by a constant, whose value is less than one, known as a first-order (Ham) reduction factor. For example, within a triplet T1 electronic state, the spin-orbit coupling operator [...] can be replaced by , where [...] {{is a function of the}} strength of the JT coupling which varies from 1 in zero coupling to 0 in very <b>strong</b> <b>coupling.</b> Furthermore, when second-order perturbation corrections are included, additional terms are introduced involving additional numerical factors, known as second-order (Ham) reduction factors.
