40|$|The main {{research}} {{topic of}} this dissertation thesis {{deals with the}} influence of the working accuracy related to large CNC machines on the required workpiece properties. The state-of-the art has constantly been developed and the customer’s requirements directed to manufacturers of the machine tools are increasingly demanding. There is required a high accuracy, reliability, <b>shortening</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> etc. The manufacturer is expected to fulfill all the customer’s requirements. The machining accuracy is dependent, among others, on the positioning accuracy of a machine tool that represents the position of the cutting tool relative to a workpiece. The accuracy of a particular machine tool is therefore a limiting factor concerned with reaching the highest accuracy and quality of a workpiece. Acceptance test procedures are initially realized within a manufacturing shop floor and then within a customer environment. The main subject of the testing procedures is to verify. basic properties of a machine tool such as basic dimensions of a machine, strokes in all respective coordinates, machine travels and spindle speeds. A machining of a workpiece with a desired precision specified by the customer is also performed. In this thesis, a new methodology to calculate and determine errors concerned with machining on vertical lathes is proposed with the aim of predicting the machining accuracy of CNC machine tools. The objective of this work was to determine the influence of machining accuracy of a CNC machine in connection with a subsequent geometrical accuracy of a workpiece. Considered position of a tool relative to a workpiece will be affected by errors concerned with a kinematical inaccuracy, geometrical errors and errors related to machining forces. A vertical lathe SKIQ 30 produced by TOSHULIN, a. s. {{has been used as a}} testing machine on which the proposed methodology has been verified. During processing various calculations in this thesis there has been found out that the machining inaccuracy of the machine – main topic of interest – is influenced by the machining conditions such as cutting conditions, material to be machined and even the setting of working positions of the machine. For instance, a position of the cross slide is determined by a workpiece height and a position of the lathe carriage that is determined by a workpiece diameter and a travel of the slide that is also determined by a workpiece height. It can be stated then that to predict the machining accuracy of work pieces, it is important to know the behavior of the machine in its all range of working envelope. Based on the information acquired about the behavior of the machine, it can be determined an appropriate position for a workpiece setting that allows utilizing the maximum reachable accuracy with respect to the stiffness and geometrical accuracy of the machine tool. An appropriate setting of initial working position may influence the subsequent geometrical accuracy of a workpiece...|$|E

It is likely that this breakdown is because, in many cases, implant systems using fabricated crowns are not supported by CAD/CAM abutments. CAD/CAM system use is also subject to numerous limitations because of the licensing process imposed by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan, which is strict when compared with its constituents in other countries.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the globe}} is {{suffering}} {{an economic downturn}} and the competition within the logistics industry has {{become more and more}} intense. Therefore, a number of logistics services providers (LSPs), such as freight forwarding companies, is facing with a decline in business volume.

LSPs, in such sense, try to reappraise the current logistics network and relocate the distribution centres for cutting operating costs, reducing lead time, and enhancing customer service level. In order to help these companies achieve these goals, a decision support system (DSS) is required to analyze various factors including inbound freight costs, warehousing costs, and outbound freight costs under different scenarios.

This study aims at a treatment planner-independent comparison of radiotherapy treatment planning of IMRT and VMAT for head-and-neck cancer performed by several institutes {{and based on the}} same CT- and contouring data. METHODS: Five institutes generated IMRT and VMAT plans for five oropharyngeal cancer patients using either Pinnacle 3 or Oncentra Masterplan to be delivered on Elekta linear accelerators. RESULTS: Comparison of VMAT and IMRT plans within the same patient and institute showed significantly better sparing for almost all OARs with VMAT. The average mean dose to the parotid glands and oral cavity was reduced from 27. 2 Gy and 39. 4 Gy for IMRT to 25. 0 Gy and 36. 7 Gy for VMAT, respectively. The dose conformity at 95 % of the prescribed dose for PTVboost and PTVtotal was 1. 45 and 1. 62 for IMRT and 1. 37 and 1. 50 for VMAT, respectively. The average effective <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> was reduced from 13 : 15 min for IMRT to 5 : 54 min for VMAT.

5000|$|The {{ability to}} transport, or route, {{data from a}} source to a {{destination}} is a fundamental ability all communication networks must have. Delay and disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs), are characterized by their lack of connectivity, resulting in a lack of instantaneous end-to-end paths. In these challenging environments, popular ad hoc routing protocols such as AODV and DSR fail to establish routes. This is due to these protocols trying to first establish a complete route and then, after the route has been established, forward the actual data. However, when instantaneous end-to-end paths are difficult or impossible to establish, routing protocols must take to a [...] "store and forward" [...] approach, where data is incrementally moved and stored throughout the network in hopes that it will eventually reach its destination. [...] A common technique used to maximize {{the probability of a}} message being successfully transferred is to replicate many copies of the message in the hope that one will succeed in reaching its destination.

The method was benchmarked by comparing a robust "time-efficient plan" (with energy layer reduction) with a robust "standard clinical plan" (without energy layer reduction) for 5 oropharyngeal cases and 5 prostate cases. Both plans of each patient had equal robust plan quality, because the worst-case dose parameters of the standard clinical plan were used as dose constraints for the time-efficient plan. Worst-case robust optimization was performed, accounting for setup errors of 3 mm and range errors of 3 % + 1 mm.

40|$|Abstract Purpose Frequently, {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) conformal beams {{are used}} in lung cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Recently, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) was introduced as a new treatment modality. VMAT techniques <b>shorten</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>time,</b> reducing the possibility of intrafraction target motion. However dose distributions can be quite different from standard 3 D therapy. This study quantifies those differences, with focus on VMAT plans using unflattened photon beams. Methods A total of 15 lung cancer patients previously treated with 3 D or VMAT SBRT were randomly selected. For each patient, non-coplanar 3 D, coplanar and non-coplanar VMAT and flattening filter free VMAT (FFF-VMAT) plans were generated to meet the same objectives with 50 Gy covering 95 % of the PTV. Two dynamic arcs were used in each VMAT plan. The couch was set at ± 5 ° to the 0 ° straight position for the two non-coplanar arcs. Pinnacle version 9. 0 (Philips Radiation Oncology, Fitchburg WI) treatment planning system with VMAT capabilities was used. We analyzed the conformity index (CI), which is {{the ratio of the}} total volume receiving at least the prescription dose to the target volume receiving at least the prescription dose; the conformity number (CN) which is the ratio of the target coverage to CI; and the gradient index (GI) which is the ratio of the volume of 50 % of the prescription isodose to the volume of the prescription isodose; as well as the V 20, V 5, and mean lung dose (MLD). Paired non-parametric analysis of variance tests with post-tests were performed to examine the statistical significance of the differences of the dosimetric indices. Results Dosimetric indices CI, CN and MLD all show statistically significant improvement for all studied VMAT techniques compared with 3 D plans (p Conclusion Besides the advantage of faster <b>delivery</b> <b>times,</b> VMAT plans demonstrated better conformity to target, sharper dose fall-off in normal tissues and lower dose to normal lung than the 3 D plans for lung SBRT.

This method is replicable across other contexts and industry settings. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews the UK park homes production industry and, specifically, a major factory that builds these homes. It compares the factory method to traditional on-site construction methods. An empirical study of production times was carried out to collect data in order to analyse the current workload distribution and the process flow performance of the park homes production process. Finally, seven discrete-event simulation models were developed in order to test different scenarios and define the optimum line balance for every section of the production process. Findings – By combining time study, discrete-event simulation and trial and error methods, the workload distribution and process flow performance of the park homes production line were analysed and improved. A reduction of between 1. 82 and 36. 32 percent in balancing losses in some sections of the process was achieved. Practical implications – This paper supports current knowledge on process flow improvement and line balancing by exploring and analysing these issues in a real-life context. It can be used to guide production management practitioners in their selection of methods and demonstrates how they are exploited when seeking to improve process flow, efficiency and line balancing of production operations. Originality/value – The study uses a real industrial application to demonstrate how the methodological combination and deployment of process flow improvement strategies, such as time study, simulation, and trial and error, can help organisations achieve process flow improvements and, as a consequence, a leaner production process...|$|R
40|$|Warehouse {{management}} systems (WMS) {{play a critical}} role in supply chains and large production processes. WMS pose two crucial challenges for variability modeling and management: Firstly, the physical configuration of each warehouse differs significantly. Numerous different electronic devices like controllers, sensors, and motors are used to automate warehouses. Secondly, the processes running in a warehouse demand control and coordination of these various software and hardware components. These processes have different configurations according to customer requirements. This paper reports on our experiences when applying variability modeling techniques in WMS, in order to improve the degree of reuse and <b>shorten</b> the <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> to customers. Feature modeling is used to extract commonalities and variability in WMS. More than 200 features were identified, and categorized into three hierarchical layers. Furthermore, we linked the feature models to assets, and utilize feature models to support product derivation. Then, the lessons learned from the experiences are discussed. Based on these experiences, we conclude that feature modeling can be applied nicely for scoping features and tracing features to assets, but is not comprehensive enough to support automated configuration during product derivation in WMS...|$|R
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) {{technology has}} the potential to significantly improve supply chain dynamics, reduce shipping costs and <b>shorten</b> <b>delivery</b> lead <b>times.</b> Using AM technology, manufacturers can produce parts on demand and thus reduce the need of maintaining safety inventory. This is especially useful in the aircraft spare parts industry where currently {{there is a need to}} maintain a high level of safety inventory for high-cost long-lead time metallic parts. Therefore, more and more companies in the aerospace industry are interested in using AM technology. There are different approaches to configure the aircraft spare parts supply chain using AM technology. This paper evaluates the impact of AM in the aircraft spare parts supply chain based on the well-known supply chain operation reference model. Three supply chain scenarios are investigated; namely, conventional (as-is) supply chain, centralized AM supply chain and distributed AM supply chain. A case study is conducted based on data obtained in the literature. The result shows that the use of AM will bring various opportunities for reducing the required safety inventory of aircraft spare parts in the supply chain. A sensitivity analysis is performed and some key factors affecting the choice of AM scenarios are studied. ? 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
50|$|Harold's {{fried chicken}} is {{different}} from that served at other fast food chicken restaurants (Kentucky Fried Chicken, Brown's Chicken, Popeyes, etc.) in two ways. The first is the cooking medium: Harold's chicken is cooked in a mix of half beef tallow and half vegetable oil, while most chains use only vegetable oil. This provides a taste that is closer to the traditional fried chicken that was invented in the American South. The second major difference between Harold's chicken and most other restaurants is that at Harold's, the chicken is not fried until it is ordered, while some chains fry their chicken in large batches and store it on warming racks until it is purchased. Harold Pierce set up a chain-wide policy from the beginning that all Harold's chicken would be cooked only after it was ordered, in order to preserve the freshly cooked taste of the chicken. Originally, this meant that there was a twelve- to fifteen-minute wait between ordering the chicken and receiving it. The family have subsequently modified the original method, however: the chicken is now partially fried beforehand, and then cooked to completion when it is ordered. This maintains the chicken's freshness while <b>shortening</b> the <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> to seven or eight minutes.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to explore}} the {{application}} of manufacturing postponement in a service setting. Design/methodology/approach – In elaborating on the many key differences between goods and services highlighted in the literature, {{it has been argued}} that postponement strategies developed in manufacturing have a potential for improving service performance. The authors then examine the implications of postponement for the service push-pull boundary and the line of visibility. Findings – A focus on postponement at the service push-pull boundary enables more activities to be performed in advance. Its benefits include reducing costs and <b>shortening</b> service <b>delivery</b> <b>time.</b> Postponement can also assist service providers in re-locating the line of visibility to develop a more effective service operation. Originality/value – While the significant economic benefits of postponement have been documented in manufacturing companies, the literature has also mentioned the potential role of postponement in service. However, very little has been written with respect to the exploitation of the transferability and applicability of postponement to a service setting. In this paper, the authors have explored what value postponement might have to offer for service operations. The application of postponement has a potential for service performance akin to what is expected of a manufacturing organisatio...|$|R
40|$|In many disciplines, {{simulation}} {{is known}} for its advantageous capability of conducting close-to-reality experiments without affecting the real system or even demanding its availability. In software engineering, however, simulation - in particular software process simulation - is not yet widely accepted. One reason is the difficulty of delivering valid simulation models in time and in budget. As simulation models can be considered software, we believe that promising software development techniques such as agile methods and (design) patterns can be utilized to help solve the problem. In this position paper, we present a research plan that aims at enhancing IMMoS, a methodology for systematic simulation model development, by introducing agile techniques and design patterns. In order to illustrate some of our ideas, we provide an example of a design pattern for process simulation modeling. As our research proceeds, we expect that the new method, Agile/P-IMMoS, will help <b>shorten</b> simulation model <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> and cut down modeling costs without compromising model quality...|$|R
50|$|Over the {{following}} years, the domestic network grew {{to cover all}} the important cities and towns of Germany. More international routes were added through co-operation agreements. With the newly founded Iberia in Spain its longest scheduled route was 2,100 kilometres from Berlin to Madrid (though with several stopovers). The establishment of Syndicato Condor in Brazil served the airline's interests in South America where there were important German minorities at that time.The first East-West crossing of the Atlantic Ocean (from Baldonnel Aerodrome in Ireland to Greenly Island, Canada) was made by the Luft Hansa pilots Hermann Köhl and Ehrenfried Günther Freiherr von Hünefeld and the Irish pilot James Fitzmaurice using the Junkers W 33 aircraft Bremen in April 1928. The airline launched scheduled multi-leg flights to Tokyo. A Heinkel HE 12 aircraft was launched (by catapult) off the NDL liner Bremen during her maiden voyage crossing the Atlantic in 1929, <b>shortening</b> the mail <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> between Europe and North America.|$|R
40|$|Kanban {{systems have}} been {{successfully}} used to reduce inventory and improve customer service in many industries. Their advantages and limitations are discussed in this paper. Although numerous models {{have been developed to}} overcome these limitations, the studies published did not consider some of the very essential characteristics of manufacturing systems and the value added to parts when the pull or push principle was applied. This paper presents a push-pull approach which pushes through certain manufacturing stages and pulls elsewhere based on the characteristics and value added at these stages. A generalized labelcorrecting algorithm to determine the desired stages of an IDEF 3 model is developed and an industrial case study is presented. This methodology is suited for a repetitive manufacturing environment of a mixed type, i. e. job shop and flow shop, and leads to achieving the following objectives: (1) reduced in-process inventory; (2) <b>shortened</b> <b>delivery</b> lead <b>times</b> while maintaining or improving delivery dependability; (3) increased productivity and machine utilization.

40|$|Distributed mini-factory {{networks}} {{as a form}} of real-time enterprise: concept, flexibility {{potential and}} case studies* Competition in the real-time economy The dynamics of market demands require manufacturers to be flexible. Currently, however, more flexibility can only be achieved with a considerable trade-off in resource utilization. Under-utilization of resources in many companies presently lies at between 20 – 50 %, resulting in massive cost disadvantages. This particularly applies to the field of machine and plant engineering. The main reason for poor resource utilization is that today’s value-added chains are geared toward product and unit quantities. To a large extent, flexibility and efficiency have only been optimized {{at the level of the}} individual enterprise. In part, this is due to product complexity and the <b>shortening</b> of <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> in recent years by almost 50 % (Eggers/Kinkel 2002). Since the potential within companies for rationalization and flexibility has largely been exhausted, the most promising avenue for responding to the need for further dynamics in the creation of value today is considered to be the reorganization of the entire value-added chain across company boundaries. At the center of attention is production that takes place in dynamic, quickly adaptable networks. Complementary and partially overlapping production competencies in a value-added network permit the metamorphosis from rigid value-added chains to highly dynamic networks (Zahn/Foschiani 2002). Interaction within dynamic production networks * This article draws largely on the initial results of Collaborative Research Center 582, “Production of individualised products close to the market...|$|R

40|$|Processes {{to develop}} and deliver {{software}} have been evolved over the years. One of the primary motivations of this evolution, is gaining the beneﬁts of shorter time-to-market. Continuous deployment is a recent trend to deploy software to the customers automatically and in continuous fashion. Organizations adopting this trend could reach the customers faster through quick deliveries and improve the quality and productivity of the delivered product by an early feedback, and hence achieve increased customer satisfaction. Complex software intensive industrial systems are large-scale, distributed over heterogeneous platforms and interact with several sensors and actuators. Enabling continuous deployment for these industrial systems needs a stable deployment process {{able to cope with}} domain speciﬁc requirements and challenges. Notably, the required quality attributes of the deployed software product as well as the challenges introduced by the customer-speciﬁc nature of the domain. In this thesis, we formalize continuous deployment for industrial systems by identifying the main factors of an appropriate deployment process. In particular, we investigate high-level requirements, required quality attributes of the software product, and challenges in the deployment. Based on this, we propose a continuous deployment pipeline and a set of activities incorporated in the stages of the pipeline, in particular deployment and post-deployment stages. Moreover, we suggest automation support for the activities to both <b>shorten</b> the <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> and to preserve repeatability and reliability of the deployment process. The aim of such a process is to maintain the quality attributes of the deployed software. We perform a case study to validate the proposed model by implementing a prototype in an industrial syste...|$|R
