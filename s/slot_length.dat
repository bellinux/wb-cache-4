[...] Another disadvantage is that the [...] "dead time" [...] between time slots limits the potential bandwidth of a TDMA channel.

Handsets that are moving will need to constantly adjust their timings to ensure their transmission is received at precisely the right time, because as they move further from the base station, their signal will take longer to arrive. This also means that the major TDMA systems have hard limits on cell sizes in terms of range, though in practice the power levels required to receive and transmit over distances greater than the supported range would be mostly impractical anyway.|$|E

The goal programming formulation allows time preference constraints to be elastic rather than rigid.

In [7, 9], a high-speed data rate scheme (HDR) is introduced, where the base station schedules the downlink transmission of a single user at a given time slot with the data rates and <b>slot</b> <b>lengths</b> varying according to the specific channel condition. In [10 – 12], a transmission scheduling scheme for multiple users, which considers both the channel condition and queueing delay/length, is proposed and shown to be throughput optimal if it is feasible. However, the fairness issue is not explicitly addressed in that work. In [13 – 15], a framework for opportunistic scheduling that maximizes the system performance by exploiting the time-varying channel conditions of wireless networks is presented. Three categories of scheduling problems—the temporal fairness, utilitarian fairness, and minimum-performance guarantee scheduling—are studied and optimal solutions are given.|$|R
