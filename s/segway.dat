5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom {{high-speed}} cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a <b>Segway</b> to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E

25|$|Balancing robots {{generally}} use a gyroscope {{to detect}} {{how much a}} robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally in the same direction, to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second, based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum. Many different balancing robots have been designed. While the <b>Segway</b> is not commonly {{thought of as a}} robot, it {{can be thought of as}} a component of a robot, when used as such <b>Segway</b> refer to them as RMP (Robotic Mobility Platform). An example of this use has been as NASA's Robonaut that has been mounted on a <b>Segway.</b>|$|E

25|$|Polo is {{not played}} {{exclusively}} on horseback. Such polo variants are mostly played for recreational or tourist purposes; they include canoe polo, cycle polo, camel polo, elephant polo, golfcart polo, <b>Segway</b> polo and yak polo. In the early 1900s in the United States, cars were {{used instead of}} horses in the sport of Auto polo. Hobby Horse Polo is using hobby horses instead of ponies. It uses parts of the polo rules but has its own specialities, as e.g. 'punitive sherries'. The Hobby Horse variant started 1998 as a fun sport in south western Germany and lead 2002 to {{the foundation of the}} First Kurfürstlich-Kurpfälzisch Polo-Club in Mannheim. In the meantime it gained further interest in other German cities.|$|E
25|$|The {{inverted}} pendulum is {{a classic}} problem in dynamics and control theory and is widely used as a benchmark for testing control algorithms (PID controllers, state space representation, neural networks, fuzzy control, genetic algorithms, etc.). Variations on this problem include multiple links, allowing {{the motion of the}} cart to be commanded while maintaining the pendulum, and balancing the cart-pendulum system on a see-saw. The inverted pendulum is related to rocket or missile guidance, where the center of gravity is located behind the center of drag causing aerodynamic instability. The understanding of a similar problem can be shown by simple robotics {{in the form of a}} balancing cart. Balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger is a simple demonstration, and the problem is solved by self-balancing personal transporters such as the <b>Segway</b> PT, the self-balancing hoverboard and the self-balancing unicycle.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{autonomous}} vehicles, {{also known}} as driverless cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car), {{and are expected to}} be commercially available around 2020. According to urban designer and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehicles—in conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for work, travel, and pleasure—could reduce the world's 800 million vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few decades. This would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public self-driving taxis that would be in near constant use. This would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular need—a bus could come for a group of people, a limousine could come for a special night out, and a <b>Segway</b> could come for a short trip down the street for one person. Children could be chauffeured in supervised safety, DUIs would no longer exist, and 41,000 lives could be saved each year in the US alone.|$|E
