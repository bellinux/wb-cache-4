The portrait was only wanted in chalk, and would not take long; besides, I might finish it in the evening, if my other engagements pressed hard upon me in the daytime. Why not leave my luggage at the picture-dealer's, put off looking for lodgings till night, and secure the new commission boldly by going back at once with the landlord to the hotel? I decided on following this course almost as soon as the idea occurred to me--put my chalks in my pocket, and a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawing</b> paper in the first of my portfolios that came to hand--and so presented myself before Mr. Faulkner, ready to take his likeness, literally at five minutes' notice.|$|E

Not content with this she hunted out a huge <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawing</b> paper and drew upon it an original pen-and-ink design after her own heart. A dudish cat--Miss Allen was fond of the No. 16 cat if she could be said to be fond of anything--was portrayed seated on a rocker arrayed in smoking jacket and cap with a cigar waved airily aloft in one paw while the other held out a placard bearing the legend [...] "Merry Christmas." [...] A second cat in full street costume bowed politely, hat in paw, and waved a banner inscribed with [...] "Happy New Year," [...] while faintly suggested kittens gambolled around the border. The girls laughed until they cried over it and voted it to be the best thing Nellie had yet done in original work.|$|E
60|$|Looked out a {{quantity}} of things to go to Abbotsford; for we are flitting, if you please.[198] It is {{with a sense of}} pain that I leave behind a parcel of trumpery prints and little ornaments, once the pride of Lady S----'s heart, but which she sees consigned with indifference to the chance of an auction. Things that have had their day of importance with me I cannot forget, though the merest trifles. But I am glad that she, with bad health and enough to vex her, has not the same useless mode of associating recollections with this unpleasant business. The best part of it is the necessity of leaving behind, viz., setting rid of, a set of most wretched daubs of landscapes, in great gilded frames, of which I have often been heartily ashamed. The history of them was curious. An amateur artist (a lady) happened to fall into misfortunes, upon which her landscapes, the character of which had been buoyed up far beyond their proper level, sank even beneath it, and it was low enough. One most amiable and accomplished old lady continued to encourage her pencil, and to order picture after picture, which she sent in presents to her friends. I suppose I have eight or ten of them, which I could not avoid accepting. There will be plenty of laughing when they come to be sold. It would be a good joke enough to cause it to be circulated that they were performances of my own in early youth, and they would be looked on and bought up as curiosities. True it is that I took lessons of oil-painting in youth from a little Jew animalcule, a smouch called Burrell, a clever sensible creature though; but I could make no progress either in painting or drawing. Nature denied me correctness of eye and neatness of hand, yet I was very desirous to be a draughtsman at least, and laboured harder to attain that point than at any other in my recollection, to which I did not make some approaches. My oil-paintings were to Miss ------ above commemorated what hers are to Claude Lorraine. Yet Burrell was not useless to me altogether neither; he was a Prussian, and I got from him many a long story of the battles of Frederic, in whose armies his father had been a commissary, or perhaps a spy. I remember his picturesque account of seeing a party of the Black Hussars bringing in some forage carts which they had taken from a body of the Cossacks, whom he described as lying {{on the top of the}} carts of hay, mortally wounded, and, like the Dying Gladiator, eyeing their own blood as it ran down through the straw. I afterwards took lessons from Walker, whom we used to call Blue-beard. He was one of the most conceited persons in the world, but a good teacher--one of the ugliest countenances he had too--enough, as we say, to spean weans.[199] The man was always extremely precise in the quality of everything about him, his dress, accommodations, and everything else. He became insolvent, poor man, and for some reason or other I attended the meeting of those concerned in his affairs. Instead of ordinary accommodations for writing, each of the persons present was equipped with a large <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawing</b> paper and a swan's quill. It was mournfully ridiculous enough. Skirving[200] made an admirable likeness of Walker, not a single scar or mark of the smallpox which seamed his countenance, but the too accurate brother of the brush had faithfully laid it down in longitude and latitude. Poor Walker destroyed it (being in crayons) rather than let the caricature of his ugliness appear at the sale of his effects. I did learn myself to take some vile views from Nature. When Will Clerk and I lived very much together, I used sometimes to make them under his instruction. He to whom, as to all his family, art is a familiar attribute, wondered at me as a Newfoundland dog would at a greyhound which showed fear of the water.|$|E

For this purpose it is necessary to have recourse to a diagram such as the Specimen (see image)...The diagram should be carefully drawn in bold lines and clear letters on a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawing</b> paper not less than 'double elephant' size.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether the 30 emotional indicator items on human figure drawings (HFDs) developed by Koppitz were able to differentiate between the drawings of the delinquent and the normal children. To check this problem, a comparison of the HFDs was made between 29 institutionalized delinquent children and 29 normal children matched for age, sex and IQ scores. Each group included 26 boys and 3 girls; of these 4 Ss were 8 years old, 3 were 9 years old, 6 were 10 years old, 10 were 11 years old and 6 were 12 years old. Their IQ scores ranged from 71 to 118, with mean of 96. 6. Each S was asked to draw a picture of a whole person on a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawing</b> paper, size 21 cm × 28 cm, with a pencil. These HFDs were then analyzed for the presence of the 30 emotional indicator items. Chi-squares with Yates correction were computed comparing the number of Ss among the delinquent and the normal children who showed each emotional indicator on their HFDs. In addition, a comparison was made of the number of Ss in the two groups who had 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 indicators on their HFDs. The results were as follows: (1) Emotional indicator items occurred more often on HFDs of the delinquent children than on HFDs of the normal children, and the HFDs of the delinquent children showed a higher incidence of emotional indicators than the HFDs of the normal children. Delinquent children tend to draw more often "poor integration of parts", "slanting figure", "short arms" and "omission of neck". "Arms clinging to body" and "legs pressed together" were found significantly more often on the HFDs of the delinquent children. (2) 20 Ss of all normal children revealed no emotional indicators on their drawings compared to only 5 Ss of the delinquent children (Chisquare= 13. 779, P<. 001). On the other hand, two or more emotional indicators were found significantly more often on the HFDs of the delinquent children...|$|E

50|$|It is a usual {{although}} not universal convention that schematic drawings are organized {{on the page}} {{from left to right}} and top to bottom in the same sequence as the flow of the main signal or power path.

Schematic drawings intended for maintenance may have the principal signal paths highlighted to assist in understanding the signal flow through the circuit.

40|$|Appropriate cost estimation, {{monitoring}} and controlling {{are the key}} point of construction project td succeed. 2 D drawing has been a normal source of information and procedure since 1970 's. The drawback <b>of</b> <b>drawing</b> based estimating however is its nature where it has limited information that is required by the estimators. In addition, it also requires manual estimation and thus introduces inaccuracy and error in measurement. The source of inaccuracy and error comes from the estimator that needs to review many <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawing</b> for extracting building component and quantification measurement to perform materials takeoff. Therefore, more time is needed to establish unit measurement of the building component. Material takeoff in Building Information Modeling (BIM) is performing takeoff, counts and measurement of building components quantification by using parametric underlying 3 D model instead of using conventional method for conducted manual materials takeoff for cost estimation. By performing takeoff, count and measurement by using parametric model instead of conventional method, all possible problems due to miscalculation and human error can be minimized. Besides that, by using BIM model based approach on estimating and materials takeoff, takeoff, count and measurement for quantification can be done quickly and more accurately. The scope of this is study is to perform takeoff, count and measurement by using BIM 3 D parametric Architecture Model. The {{aim of this study}} is to explore the BIM model based approach on estimating and materials takeoffs. Research method that been used in this study is extracted all building component information about measurement, count and takeoff by using Revit Suite 2014 software as an input for conducting cost estimation. Finally, all the quantification takeoff extracted from parametric model is used for performing cost estimation of the architecture components of this bungalow construction. All the cost estimation is calculated by using Excel data sheet that have been developed by researcher. By using this BIM model approach, researcher believe that it will helps construction project teams for better project coordination in the coming years...|$|R
