50|$|G.B. Grayson {{was born}} in rural Ashe County, North Carolina in 1887 to Benjamin Carrol and Martha Jane Roark Grayson. According to his sister, when G.B. was six weeks old, his sight was damaged when he <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> at bright snow for several hours. While he was mostly blind his entire life, he could {{identify}} some people from their size and could tell time using a watch with large numbers. When G.B. was two years old, his family moved a few miles west to Johnson County, Tennessee, where he would live {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
5000|$|Just {{after this}} time Gilberto's father, upset by João's bizarre singing style and refusal to take [...] "normal" [...] work, {{committed}} {{him to a}} mental hospital. In a psychological interview there, Gilberto <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and remarked, “Look at the wind depilating the trees”. The psychologist replied, “But trees have no hair, João”, to which Gilberto responded, “And {{there are people who}} have no poetry”. He was released after a week. The next year (1956) he returned to Rio and struck up old acquaintances, most significantly Antônio Carlos Jobim, who was by then working as a composer, producer and arranger with Odeon Records. Jobim was impressed with Gilberto's new style of guitar playing, and set about finding a suitable song to pitch the style to Odeon management.|$|E
50|$|Effie and her bridesmaids hurry {{upstairs to}} prepare for the wedding, and James is left alone in the room. As he <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>the</b> sylph materializes before him and confesses her love. She weeps at his {{apparent}} indifference. James resists at first, but, captivated by her ethereal beauty, capitulates and kisses her tenderly. Gurn, who spies the moment from the shadows, scampers off to tell Effie what has happened.|$|R
60|$|Silas Croft looked troubled, {{but made}} no answer, and Frank Muller rose and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> old man <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Surprise {{seemed to}} hold him. A {{completely}} unexpected situation had staggered him.|$|R
60|$|But he put {{her hand}} away, and turning his face, <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> And so they reached their home.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Gereth {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and her stillness denoted {{some success in}} controlling herself. [...] "If he's not lost, why are you unhappy?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{every now}} and then the car swung her against him. And they waited for the motion to bring them together. Yet they <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> mute.|$|R
50|$|Back at Susan's, {{she asks}} Felicia {{to try a}} fresh batch of brownies that they both made (with Felicia {{poisoning}} the batter) and Felicia hesitantly eats a full brownie, and promptly vomits in her handbag. Later when Susan was feeding Paul, she tells him that her and Mike were ready to move back into their house, causing Paul {{to believe that she}} didn't actually care about him, and that she just wanted her house back. He then throws her <b>out,</b> and <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> angrily. He then collapses on the floor.|$|R
50|$|They go to {{the races}} as planned and Trevor is {{given a chance to}} drive, as promised. Trevor seems to enjoy the experience, but gets into an accident, after which his car will not restart. Trevor is unable to {{complete}} the race. On the drive back to the assessment centre, Peter informs Trevor that he was up against professional racers, did well. He also tells him that he could join a racing team if he wished, and need not go around stealing cars any longer. Trevor makes no reply, and blankly <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
50|$|While sharing an elevator, Bob Benson (James Wolk), {{who says}} he works in {{accounts}} on SCDP's second floor, tries his best to make an impression on Don, although Don struggles to remember who Benson is. At the office Don finds the copywriting team (now openly smoking marijuana) hoping for feedback about his trip to inspire a concept for the Royal Hawaiian pitch. Photographers are taking pictures of the partners, and Don finds his office rearranged for that purpose. Now alone in his office, Don <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and hears <b>the</b> ocean.|$|R
6000|$|Logan {{looked very}} grave. He rose and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> into <b>the</b> mist. Then he came back, and stood beside Merton's chair. He {{spoke in a}} low voice: ...|$|R
50|$|The film ends as Aydın {{returns home}} the next day. As Nihal <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> silently, Aydin's voice is heard {{explaining}} that he cannot live without Nihal, even if she does not love him anymore.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> He {{answered}} in tones of excessive reasonableness: [...] "I didn't start these hostels {{to be run}} by you and your--friend." [...] He gave the sentence the quality of an ultimatum, an irreducible minimum.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Merrick <b>stared</b> silently <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> {{and for a}} {{few moments}} seemed lost in thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, they do it, I don't. Now, if you----" [...] Tom {{brought his}} words {{to a sudden}} stop, and {{commenced}} to <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Far over <b>the</b> distant wood {{he had seen a}} strange light. Now it was increasing rapidly.|$|R
60|$|Edward Cossey did not reject this {{suggestion}} with the contempt {{that might have}} been expected; on the contrary he appeared to be turning the matter over in his mind, for he drummed a little tune with his knuckles and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
60|$|Neighbours in London! The Ramboats did {{not know}} the names of the people on either side of them. As I waited for Marion before we started off upon our honeymoon flight, Mr. Ramboat, I remember, came and stood beside me and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
60|$|The slatternly general servant re{{appeared}} {{with the}} chops and tinned salmon {{he had asked}} Madam Gadow to prepare for them. He went and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> heard <b>the</b> door close behind the girl, and turned at a sound as Ethel appeared shyly through the folding-doors.|$|R
50|$|Astrid {{goes to a}} {{comic book}} shop looking for letters from Paul. He soon shows up by bus in Los Angeles with her waiting for him. He accompanies her to her mother's trial as she waits to testify. <b>The</b> {{courtroom}} lets <b>out</b> and a curious Astrid goes {{to see what is}} going on. She questions her mother's attorney and finds out that she was instructed her to leave her alone. Her mother spots her in the courtroom and they stare at one another as she is led away. Gutted, Astrid <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> as her mother is taken back to the bus to return to prison. Paul asks what happened and she exhales that her mother let her go.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned his}} back upon it and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> over <b>the</b> trees and greenery. The balcony was {{decorated}} with white and pink geraniums in pots painted black and gold, and the railings of the balcony were black and gold with crimson shape like squares wildly out of drawing.|$|R
5000|$|At night, Maggie and Sasha {{wake up to}} {{loud music}} coming from a car parked on the Hilltop's interior, with the Hilltop gates open. Walkers are being {{attracted}} by the music and multiple fires that have been set inside the Hilltop. Jesus starts fighting walkers hand-to-hand. Sasha tries {{to get in the}} car to shut off the music, but it's locked and barred. Gregory <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of <b>the</b> house, but does not take action. Maggie ends up driving a large tractor over the car, which finally stops the music. Sasha and Jesus kill the rest of the walkers. The next day, Gregory and Jesus discuss what to do about Maggie and Sasha when some Saviors show up. Gregory tells Jesus to hide Maggie and Sasha in the closet.|$|R
5000|$|Pulitzer-prize-winning LA {{restaurant}} critic Jonathan Gold put Carney's on {{his list}} of 99 essential Los Angeles restaurants and wrote that, [...] "Carney’s is a restaurant in the real Los Angeles tradition, two ancient Union Pacific cars transported to West Hollywood at great expense and mounted overlooking the Strip, where a mad parade of bass players and catalog models, hustlers and high school kids, movie guys and industry suits <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of <b>the</b> old train, onto the profusion of German tourists and Japanese cars that flow down this section of Sunset so steadily that after a few beers and a chili dog or two, the train can appear to be lurching down the track." [...] KTVU movie critic Bob Shaw was fond of Carney's burgers. Carney's serves a chocolate-dipped frozen banana on a stick for dessert.|$|R
60|$|Virginia {{sank back}} on the stuffy {{cushions}} of the rattle-trap, and then sat upright again and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> at <b>the</b> dismal scene. They were splashing through a sea of mud. Ever since they had left St. Louis, Captain Lige had done his best to cheer her, {{and he did not}} intend to desist now.|$|R
60|$|My cousin {{coughed and}} turned about to <b>stare</b> hard <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> He was, he perceived, much more shockingly {{inadequate}} even {{than he had}} expected to be.|$|R
6000|$|I {{could think}} of nothing else. I could not study, I could only sit and <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> with tears running down my cheeks, until at last, the teacher observing my distress, inquired, [...] "What is the matter?" [...] And I, not knowing how to enter upon so terrible a tale, whined out, [...] "I'm sick, I want to go home." ...|$|R
6000|$|He put off {{the luxury}} of opening the letter till after the rites of {{brushing}} his teeth, putting on his slippers, pounding his rocking-chair cushion into softness. Panting with the joy to come, he <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> at a giant and glorious figure of Istra--the laughing Istra of breakfast camp-fire--which towered from the street below. He sighed joyously and read: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped and}} stared at me. I felt all that foolish {{incapacity}} an Englishman feels on such occasions. I met {{his eyes for a}} moment, and then <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> For a long space we kept silence. When at last I looked at him he was sitting back in his corner, his arms folded and his teeth gnawing at his knuckles.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} my brother <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> in blank astonishment, {{watching}} the policemen hammering at door after door, and delivering their incomprehensible message. Then {{the door behind him}} opened, and the man who lodged across the landing came in, dressed only in shirt, trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his waist, his hair disordered from his pillow.|$|R
5000|$|The two meet, but Sheryl {{seems to}} have come to an {{understanding}} regarding her situation. She decides {{that she wants to}} put the baby up for adoption. She also suggests that her situation is too complicated for a young woman such as herself to realistically see through a life with Rick, a baby, and no money or viable career opportunities for either of them. Rick is upset, and hands her an engagement ring that he planned to propose with, suggesting that she could pawn it. Alice then talks to Sheryl, asking her what happened to her earlier views regarding how nothing could stop true love. Sheryl tells her that she is simply too young to understand. As Alice suggests the three of them running away together, Sheryl tells Alice that she mustn't leave her loved ones. As Alice is put on a bus back to Long Island and <b>stares</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> at Rick, Sheryl comes <b>out,</b> and <b>the</b> two embrace.|$|R
5000|$|Bailey {{was born}} in Ponteland, near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and was brought up there. She later wrote of her {{experience}} at Ponteland High School: [...] "Whilst at school I used to sit and <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> dreaming of anything but lessons, then go home and write pages and pages in my diary of who did what to whom and (usually) why wasn’t I part of it." ...|$|R
60|$|The dawn came slowly. It {{was rather}} cold. Olive wrapped herself in rugs {{and went to}} sleep again. Helena shivered, and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> There {{appeared}} a wanness in the night, and Helena felt inexpressibly dreary. A rosiness spread out far away. It was like a flock of flamingoes hovering over a dark lake. The world vibrated as the sun came up.|$|R
60|$|Presently a {{train of}} thought carried him off. His {{attitude}} relaxed a little, the Schema became for a time a mere symbol, a point of departure, and he <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> at <b>the</b> darkling night. For a long time he sat pursuing thoughts that were half emotions, emotions that took upon themselves the shape and substance of ideas. The deepening current stirred at last among the roots of speech.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] he said concisely, as she {{put them}} down, and turned his {{shoulder}} upon her and <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> again. It was altogether too discouraging. Evidently he was sensitive {{on the topic of}} operations and bandages. She did not [...] "make so bold as to say," [...] however, after all. But his snubbing way had irritated her, and Millie had a hot time of it that afternoon.|$|R
60|$|Aaron <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> {{and played}} <b>the</b> one single British role left to him, that of {{ignoring}} his neighbours, isolating himself in their midst, and minding his own business. Upon this insular trick our greatness and our predominance depends--such as it is. Yes, they {{might look at}} him. They might think him a servant or what they liked. But he was inaccessible to them. He isolated himself upon himself, and there remained.|$|R
60|$|In the {{limousine}} scarcely a word was spoken. Maggie {{leaned back in}} her seat, her face dazed and expressionless. Opposite to her, Nigel sat with set, grim face, looking with fixed <b>stare</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> at <b>the</b> deserted streets. Of the three, Naida seemed more on the point of giving way to emotion. They had passed Hyde Park Corner, however, before a word was spoken. Then it was she who broke the silence.|$|R
