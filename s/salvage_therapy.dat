40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) {{has become}} the most used {{surgical}} procedure to treat clinically localized prostate cancer. Considering its curative intent, the evaluation of the oncologic outcomes must be considered with careful attention. In this review, we summarized and critically discussed the most relevant oncologic data available in the literature about RALP. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, the oncologic effectiveness of RALP procedure can be evaluated looking at surrogate end-points such as positive surgical margins rate, percentage of additional <b>salvage</b> <b>therapies</b> required, and biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS). Available studies comparing RALP and retropubic radical prostatectomy showed that positive surgical margin rates were equivalent or slightly lower following RALP. Moreover, population-based studies showed similar risk in terms of additional <b>salvage</b> <b>therapies</b> between retropubic radical prostatectomy and minimally invasive radical prostatectomy. Moreover, comparative studies with short-term follow-up demonstrated overlapping results also in terms of bDFS. The initial long-term oncologic data (5 -year median follow-up) estimated excellent 5 -year and 7 -year bDFS probabilities after RALP. SUMMARY: Although further studies with long-term follow-up are needed to estimate the main oncologic outcomes (overall and cancer-specific survival), available data supported the oncologic safety of RALP procedure in patients with clinically organ-confined prostate cancer...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{estimate}} {{the occurrence of}} positive lymph nodes on magnetic resonance lymphography (MRL) in patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after prostatectomy and to investigate the relation between score on the Stephenson nomogram and lymph node involvement on MRL. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-five candidates for <b>salvage</b> radiation <b>therapy</b> were referred for an MRL to determine their lymph node status. Clinical and histopathologic features were recorded. For 49 patients, data were complete to calculate the Stephenson nomogram score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine how well this nomogram related to the MRL result. Analysis was done for the whole group and separately for patients with a PSA < 1. 0 ng/mL to determine the situation in candidates for early <b>salvage</b> radiation <b>therapy,</b> and for patients without pathologic lymph nodes at initial lymph node dissection. RESULTS: MRL detected positive lymph nodes in 47 patients. ROC analysis for the Stephenson nomogram yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0. 78 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 61 - 0. 93). Of 29 patients with a PSA < 1. 0 ng/mL, 18 had a positive MRL. Of 37 patients without lymph node involvement at initial lymph node dissection, 25 had a positive MRL. ROC analysis for the Stephenson nomogram showed AUCs of 0. 84 and 0. 74, respectively, for these latter groups. CONCLUSION: MRL detected positive lymph nodes in 72 % of candidates for <b>salvage</b> radiation <b>therapy,</b> in 62 % of candidates for early <b>salvage</b> radiation <b>therapy,</b> and in 68 % of initially node-negative patients. The Stephenson nomogram showed a good correlation with the MRL result and may thus be useful for identifying patients with a PSA recurrence who {{are at high risk}} for lymph node involvement...|$|R
40|$|To {{develop a}} microRNA (miRNA) -based {{predictive}} model {{for prostate cancer}} patients of 1) time to biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and 2) biochemical recurrence after <b>salvage</b> radiation <b>therapy</b> following documented biochemical disease progression post-radical prostatectomy. Forty three patients who had undergone <b>salvage</b> radiation <b>therapy</b> following biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy with greater than 4 years of follow-up data were identified. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were collected for all patients and total RNA was isolated from 1 mm cores enriched for tumor (> 70 %). Eight hundred miRNAs were analyzed simultaneously using the nCounter human miRNA v 2 assay (NanoString Technologies; Seattle, WA). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportion hazards regression models as well as receiver operating characteristics were used to identify statistically significant miRNAs that were predictive of biochemical recurrence. Eighty eight miRNAs were identified to be significantly (p 36 months). Nine miRNAs were identified to be significantly (p< 0. 05) associated by multivariate analysis with biochemical failure after <b>salvage</b> radiation <b>therapy.</b> A new predictive model for biochemical recurrence after <b>salvage</b> radiation <b>therapy</b> was developed; this model consisted of miR- 4516 and miR- 601 together with, Gleason score, and lymph node status. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was improved to 0. 83 {{compared to that of}} 0. 66 for Gleason score and lymph node status alone. miRNA signatures can distinguish patients who fail soon after radical prostatectomy versus late failures, giving insight into which patients may need adjuvant therapy. Notably, two novel miRNAs (miR- 4516 and miR- 601) were identified that significantly improve prediction of biochemical failure post-salvage radiation therapy compared to clinico-histopathological factors, supporting the use of miRNAs within clinically used predictive models. Both findings warrant further validation studies...|$|R

50|$|Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) {{are given}} {{to slow down the}} HIV reproduction, which in turn {{increases}} quality of life and survival. If the patient's viral load (the amount of HIV in the blood) rebounds after being suppressed by ARVs, the virus has likely developed resistance to the ARVs.
