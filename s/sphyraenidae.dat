40|$|Although the <b>Sphyraenidae</b> {{occur in}} all warm seas, there are {{probably}} less than twenty valid species, about twelve in the Indo-Pacific, one of which occurs in the Atlantic as well.

The <b>Sphyraenidae</b> are of some importance as food, the flesh of all species being delicate and well flavoured. In some parts there have been reliable reports that the flesh of certain species may cause acute poisoning, but we found no evidence of this in the Western Indian Ocean. As may be deduced from the torpedo-like body and the huge mouth with formidable sabre-like teeth, the large species are fierce predators and much feared as they move with great speed and do not hesitate to attack man. They are not generally ranked very high as game fishes, for most are taken on heavy tackle put out for larger types such as Tunny and so are easily subdued.

40|$|One of the {{expected}} effects of global change is increased variability in the abundance and distribution of living organisms, but information at the appropriate temporal and geographical scales is often lacking to observe these patterns. Here we use local knowledge as an alternative information source to study some emerging changes in Mediterranean fish diversity. A pilot study of thirty-two fishermen was conducted in 2009 from four Mediterranean locations along a south-north gradient. Semi-quantitative survey information on changes in species abundance was recorded by year and suggests that 59 fish species belonging to 35 families have experienced changes in their abundance. We distinguished species that increased from species that decreased or fluctuated. Multivariate analysis revealed significant differences between these three groups of species, as well as significant variation between the study locations.

40|$|The muscles {{serving the}} ventral {{portion of the}} gill arches ( = infrabranchial musculature) are poorly known in bony fishes. A {{comparative}} analysis of the infrabranchial muscles in the major percomorph lineages reveals {{a large amount of}} phylogenetically-relevant information. Characters derived from this anatomical system are identified and discussed in light of current hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships among percomorphs. New evidence supports a sister-group relationship between the Batrachoidiformes and Lophiiformes and between the Callionymoidei and Gobiesocoidei. Investigated data also corroborate the existence of two monophyletic groups, one including the Pristolepididae, Badidae, and Nandidae, and a second clade consisting of all non-amarsipid stromateiforms. New synapomorphies are proposed for the Atherinomorphae, Blenniiformes, Lophiiformes, Scombroidei (including <b>Sphyraenidae),</b> and Gobiiformes. Within the latter order, the Rhyacichthyidae and Odontobutidae are supported as the successive sister families of all remaining gobiiforms. The present analysis further confirms the validity of infrabranchial musculature characters previously proposed to support the grouping of the Mugiliformes with the Atherinomorphae and the monophyly of the Labriformes with the possible inclusion of the Pholidichthyiformes. Interestingly, most hypotheses of relationships supported by the infrabranchial musculature have been advanced by preceding anatomists on the basis of distinct data sources, but were never recovered in recent molecular phylogenies. These conflicts clearly indicate the current unsatisfactory resolution of the higher-level phylogeny of percomorphs...|$|E
40|$|Studies on {{environmental}} variables and ecological distribution of ichthyofauna assemblages {{were conducted in}} the Calabar River.

Seasonal variation shows significant differences in surface water temperature, pH, DO, BOD, conductivity, TDS and TSS between sampling stations and insignificant differences in heavy metals such as cadmium, chromium, iron and copper between sampling stations. Twenty six species of fish fauna were identified belonging to twenty two families. Mugilidae, Clariidae, Cichlidae, Gobiidae and Sciaenidae were the most abundant for both wet and dry season, while Clupeidae, Bathyclupeidae, Carangidae and <b>Sphyraenidae</b> were low in the wet season but high in the dry season. Chromium, copper, surface water temperature, DO correlate significantly with the presence of E. fimbriata, B. soporator, M. sebae, C. gariepinus, M. loennbergii, C. guentheri and P. babarus.

A total of 318 specimens ranging from 19 to 63 cm fork length (FL) were examined. The vacuity index varied significantly between seasons with higher values in great cold season (71. 3 %), intermediate in the great and short dry seasons, 53. 7 % and 54. 9 %, reapectively, and lowest in low cold season (48. 9 %).

40|$|Shifts in catch {{composition}} were {{registered in the}} Eritrean artisanal fisheries, which were launched into a renewed development {{after the end of}} the independence war in 1991. Our analysis of catch and effort data showed that total fishing effort as well as total annual catch increased more than two-fold from 1996 to 2002. Yet, overall CPUE remained unchanged upon the expansion of the fisheries, suggesting that the fisheries are still at an early stage of development. However, at lower taxonomic level, we found that the CPUE for emperors (Lethrinidae), snappers (Lutjanidae), and sharks (Elasmobranchii) decreased, while the CPUE for barracudas (<b>Sphyraenidae),</b> jacks (Carangidae), and tunas (Scombridae) increased. Thus, the species composition of the catches shifted toward a smaller proportion of high-value demersals (from ca. 70 % in 1996 to ca. 30 % in 2002), implying a change in the underlying fish community structure. Changes in CPUE could not be attributed to changes in spatial effort allocation, or to changes in gear or boats used, ruling out changes in fishing strategies as likely causes. Yet the decline in CPUE at low fishing effort does not necessarily reflect a proportional decline in fish abundance, and could possibly be caused by ¿hyperdepletion¿. Nevertheless, the trends in CPUE are consistent with earlier findings that stocks of reef-associated demersal fishes are highly vulnerable to fishing and can decline even at the early stages of the fisheries. Therefore, the changes in CPUE could indeed represent true biomass changes, with potentially important ecological consequences. These effects could even become more severe if market conditions improve, leading to activation of latent fishing capacity, which was found to make up about 75 % of the registered fleet...|$|E

40|$|Background A long, {{slender body}} plan {{characterized}} by an elongate antorbital region and posterior displacement of the unpaired fins has evolved multiple times within ray-finned fishes, and is associated with ambush predation. The axial skeleton of ray-finned fishes is divided into abdominal and caudal regions, considered to be evolutionary modules. In this study, we test whether the convergent evolution of the ambush predator body plan is associated with predictable, regional changes in the axial skeleton, specifically whether the abdominal region is preferentially lengthened relative to the caudal region through the addition of vertebrae. We test this hypothesis in seven clades showing convergent evolution of this body plan, examining abdominal and caudal vertebral counts in over 300 living and fossil species. In four of these clades, we also {{examined the relationship between}} the fineness ratio and vertebral regionalization using phylogenetic independent contrasts. Results We report that in five of the clades surveyed, Lepisosteidae, Esocidae, Belonidae, <b>Sphyraenidae</b> and Fistulariidae, vertebrae are added preferentially to the abdominal region. In Lepisosteidae, Esocidae, and Belonidae, increasing abdominal vertebral count was also significantly related to increasing fineness ratio, a measure of elongation. Two clades did not preferentially add abdominal vertebrae: Saurichthyidae and Aulostomidae. Both of these groups show the development of a novel caudal region anterior to the insertion of the anal fin, morphologically differentiated from more posterior caudal vertebrae. Conclusions The preferential addition of abdominal vertebrae in fishes with an elongate body shape is consistent with the existence of a conservative positioning module formed by the boundary between the abdominal and caudal vertebral regions and the anterior insertion of the anal fin. Dissociation of this module is possible, although less probable than changes in the independently evolving abdominal region. Dissociation of the axial skeleton-median fin module leads to increased regionalization within the caudal vertebral column, something that has evolved several times in bony fishes, and may be homologous with the sacral region of tetrapods. These results suggest that modularity of the axial skeleton may result in somewhat predictable evolutionary outcomes in bony fishes...|$|E
