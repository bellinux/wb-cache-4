He also was ordered to create a <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>colony</b> at Roanoke Island [...] and thought it had {{the potential to be a}} model for a new society in which African Americans would have freedom. In addition to serving the original residents and recent migrants, the Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony was to be a refuge for the families of freedmen who enlisted in the Union Army as United States Colored Troops. By 1864, there were more than 2200 freedmen on the island.|$|E
5000|$|During the American Civil War, Confederate-owned {{slaves who}} sought refuge in Union {{military}} camps or {{who lived in}} territories that fell under Union control were declared [...] "contraband of war". The policy was first articulated by General Benjamin F. Butler in 1861, in {{what came to be}} known as the [...] "Fort Monroe Doctrine," [...] established in Hampton, Virginia. By war's end, the Union had set up 100 contraband camps in the South, and the Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony (1863-1867) was developed to be a <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>colony.</b> Many adult freedmen worked for wages for the Army at such camps, teachers were recruited from the North for their schools by the American Missionary Association, and thousands of freedmen enlisted from such camps in the United States Colored Troops to fight with the Union against the Confederacy.|$|E

5000|$|The {{word spread}} quickly among southeastern Virginia's slave communities. While {{becoming}} a [...] "contraband" [...] {{did not mean}} full freedom, many slaves considered it a step in that direction. The day after Butler's decision, many more escaped slaves {{found their way to}} Fort Monroe and appealed to become contraband. As the number of former slaves grew too large to be housed inside the Fort, the contrabands erected housing outside the crowded base from the burned ruins of the City of Hampton. They called their new settlement Grand Contraband Camp (which they nicknamed [...] "Slabtown"). By {{the end of the war}} in April 1865, less than four years later, an estimated 10,000 escaped slaves had applied to gain [...] "contraband" [...] status, with many living nearby. Across the South, Union forces managed more than 100 contraband camps, although not all were as large. From a camp on Roanoke Island that started in 1862, Horace James developed the Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island (1863-1867). Appointed by the Union Army, James was a Congregational chaplain who, with the freedmen, tried to create a <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>colony</b> at the island.|$|E
5000|$|Dr Jameson’s {{programme}} {{was largely}} one of material development. In {{the words of}} the speech opening the 1905 session of parliament, [...] "without a considerable development of our agricultural and pastoral resources our position as a <b>self-sustaining</b> <b>colony</b> cannot be assured". This reliance on its own resources was the more necessary for the Cape because of the keen rivalry of Natal and Delagoa Bay for the carrying trade of the Transvaal. The opening up of backward districts by railways was vigorously pursued, and in other ways great efforts were made to assist agriculture. These efforts to help the country districts met with cordial recognition from the Dutch farmers, and the release, in May 1904, of all rebel prisoners was another step towards reconciliation. On the exclusion of Chinese from the colony the Bond party were also in agreement with the ministry. An education act passed in 1905 established school boards on a popular franchise and provided for the gradual introduction of compulsory education. The cultivation of friendly relations with the neighbouring colonies {{was also one of the}} leading objects of Dr Jameson’s policy. The Bond, on its side, sought to draw closer to Het Volk, the Boer organization in the Transvaal, and similar bodies, and at its 1906 congress, held in March that year at Ceres, a resolution with that aim was passed, the design being to unify, in accordance with the original conception of the Bond, Dutch sentiment and action throughout South Africa.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{historically}} few researchers studying limb regeneration, remarkable {{progress has been made}} recently in establishing the neotenous amphibian the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) as a model genetic organism. This progress has been facilitated by advances in genomics, bioinformatics, and somatic cell transgenesis in other fields, that have created the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of important biological properties, such as limb regeneration, in the axolotl. The Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (AGSC) is a <b>self-sustaining,</b> breeding <b>colony</b> of the axolotl supported by the National Science Foundation as a Living Stock Collection. Located at the University of Kentucky, the AGSC is dedicated to supplying genetically well-characterized axolotl embryos, larvae, and adults to laboratories throughout the United States and abroad.

40|$|An {{abundant}} {{supply of}} water on the Moon would make establishment of a <b>self-sustaining</b> lunar <b>colony</b> much more feasible and less expensive than presently thought. Study of lunar samples revealed that the interior of the Moon is essentially devoid of water, so no underground supplies could be used by lunar inhabitants. However, the lunar surface is bombarded with water-rich objects such as comets, and scientists have suspected that some of the water in these objects could migrate to permanently dark areas at the lunar poles, perhaps accumulating to useable quantities. Analysis of data returned from a radio-wave experiment performed in 1994 while the Clementine spacecraft was orbiting the Moon reveals that deposits of ice exist in permanently dark regions near the south pole of the Moon. Initial estimates suggest that the volume of small lake exists, 1 billion cubic meters. For comparison, this amount of water would be equivalent to the fuel (hydrogen and oxygen) used for more than a million launches of the Space Shuttle from Cape Canaveral...|$|R
50|$|The tobacco {{monopoly}} made the <b>colony</b> <b>self-sustaining</b> and profit-earning. In 1808, the government realized a net profit of P500,000.00. These profits increased in subsequent years, reaching $3,000,000 in 1881. As {{a consequence of}} the monopoly, the Philippines became the biggest tobacco-producing country in Asia. However, it led to abuses by government officials who wanted to enrich themselves. The farmers abhorred the crop as they were at the mercy of government agents who cheated on its price, and they did not have the liberty to raise other crops for themselves and their families. The monopoly also encouraged bribery and smuggling due to the desire to evade strict government regulations. The {{tobacco monopoly}} was abolished in 1882.|$|R
40|$|The BPRC {{houses a}} <b>self-sustaining</b> {{breeding}} <b>colony</b> of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) {{for the purpose}} of conducting biomedical research. Their immunological, physiological, and genetic proximity to humans make marmosets useful as model for specific human diseases. In order to ensure reliable data collection and the reproducibility of the experiments, optimal welfare procedures with respect to housing, husbandry and veterinary care need to be in place. Optimal welfare results in better experiments and in reduction of the number of animals needed. In order to ensure all this, the in this thesis described studies were performed. The vocalisations produced by marmosets were recorded and analysed to assess if they were suitable as welfare indicator. Moreover, the recovery period, which marmosets need after implantation of an abdominal telemetric transmitter, was determined. Additionally, we evaluated whether new housing and husbandry modifications at the BPRC, which were assumed to improve the animals’ welfare, constituted an increased veterinary risk for the marmosets. Furthermore, a detailed description and illustrations of the skeleton of the common marmoset as an anatomical guide were described. Finally, the clinical use, cardiorespiratory effects and reliability of sedatives alone and in combination with different analgesic premedication were determined...|$|R
40|$|During the {{evolution}} of higher plants on Earth, changes in numerous environmental factors occurred, but gravity has been a steady and unchanging force. The alteration of gravitational stimulus can cause modification of plant growth in various aspects {{that need to be}} investigated before the establishment of <b>self-sustaining</b> human <b>colonies</b> in Space, supported by Bio-regenerative systems. This paper reports the results of an experiment conducted onboard of Foton-M 2 satellite where soy seedlings grew during a 5 -days period. The experiment was aimed to investigate the effect of microgravity on seed germination, seedling development, morphology and anatomy. The environmental conditions, other than gravity, of the ground control were repeated as identical as possible to those experienced on orbit. Seedlings developed in Space were compared with those grown in 1 g on the basis of numerous anatomical and cytological parameters, such as size and shape of cells and intercellular spaces, amount and distribution of starch and phenolics in different organs and tissues. The observations made through light and fluorescence microscopy, together with the quantification of structural features, by means of digital image analysis, allowed to evidence that the various organs and tissues of soy seedlings show different degrees of alteration after the development in microgravity...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Availability of {{suitable}} nesting habitat that {{is free of}} nest {{predators and}} provides access to adequate prey resources within commuting distance {{is a major factor}} limiting seabird populations. Caspian terns (Hydroprogne caspia) in western North America have shifted their breeding habitat from naturally occurring habitats in interior wetlands, lakes, and rivers to primarily human-created habitats in coastal bays and estuaries. This shift has brought Caspian terns into conflict with fisheries of conservation concern, in particular anadromous salmonids. Prior to the 2010 breeding season, three artificial islands were built in the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) Complex as alternative nesting habitat for Caspian terns currently nesting at the world's largest colony for the species, near the mouth of the Columbia River, Oregon. I investigated the efficacy of habitat creation (island building) and social attraction (decoys and recorded vocalizations) for establishing new breeding colonies in the Upper Klamath Basin, California. In 2010, approximately 258 pairs of Caspian terns attempted to nest on the new islands and raised an average of 0. 65 fledglings/breeding pair; in 2011, 222 pairs attempted to nest and raised an average of 0. 11 fledglings/breeding pair. Competition with California and ring-billed gulls (Larus californicus and L. delawarensis) for nesting space, gull predation on Caspian tern eggs and chicks, low water levels, and depredation by great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) were the primary factors limiting colony development and productivity, especially in 2011. The immediate response by Caspian terns to habitat creation and social attraction in the Upper Klamath Basin demonstrates that these can be effective restoration techniques to establish new breeding colonies where nesting habitat is a major limiting factor; however, continued management of other limiting factors (e. g., control of on-colony predators and competitors) will likely be necessary to promote the development of established, <b>self-sustaining</b> breeding <b>colonies</b> on these artificial islands. Efforts to conserve and restore seabird colonies can be compromised by low prey availability within foraging distance of the breeding colony. I used GPS telemetry to study the fine-scale foraging behavior of Caspian terns nesting at two newly established colonies and cluster analysis to discriminate behavioral states based on movement characteristics. Terns breeding at the Sheepy Lake colony spent less time at the colony (52...|$|R
