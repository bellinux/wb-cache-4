40|$|Abstract- India’s {{economic}} growth is contingent upon {{the growth of the}} Indian <b>steel</b> industry. <b>Consumption</b> of <b>steel</b> is taken to be an indicator of economic development. In steel plants, steel silos are used for the storage of bulk materials. However, steel silos differ principally from their concrete counterparts in physical properties like the high strength per unit weight and ductility. The high yield and ultimate strength result in slender sections. Being ductile the steel structures give sufficient advance warning before failure by way of excessive deformations. Steel silo is elevated and supported by frames. This paper describes the analysis and design of high-rise steel building frame with braced and without braced under effect of wind and earthquake using SAP 2000 and also to compare the response of braced and unbraced building which subjected to horizontal or lateral loading system. Dynamic analysis is carried out by using Equivalent Static method and Response spectrum method for earthquake zone V as per Indian code. The results in terms of Natural period, Design Base shear, lateral Displacements are compared for the different silo supporting models considered in the present study.

40|$|Abstract. The US National Cooperative Highway Research Program is developing, under project 12 - 51, a new {{methodology}} and decision support tool {{to be used}} by highway agencies to estimate the network-level bridge costs due to changes in truck weight limits. Combined with other tools for pavements and other affected assets, the system will help agencies to assess the full costs and benefits of allowing heavier trucks to use the highway network, or even restricting the network to lighter trucks. Using bridge inventory data, the methodology addresses four cost impact categories: <b>steel</b> fatigue <b>consumption,</b> deck fatigue consumption, overstress deficiencies, and higher new bridge design loads. For the first two categories, it quantifies the change in the number and magnitude range of loading cycles and assesses the probability of fatigue damage for cost estimation. For the latter two categories, it estimates the change in load rating requirement and design load requirement, respectively. Then the impact costs are estimated based on these requirements. To enable practical application of the methodology, a decision support tool is being developed in Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic. The system consists of a connected set of workbooks for preparing inventory data, describing scenarios of weight limit changes, and analyzing the impacts. Paul D. Thompson, et al. ...|$|R

40|$|Stainless steels {{have become}} one of the most popular {{materials}} for the metal injection molding (MIM) process. Due to the poor yield of fine particles in powder production, the cost of relatively fine powders was extremely high. With improvements in the powder processing technique, relatively fine stainless steel powders (mean 10 to 15 micrometers) became available during the 1990 ’s, resulting in a concomitant decrease in the powder price and a rapid increase in the stainless <b>steel</b> powder <b>consumption</b> in the MIM industry. This situation has remained stable till date. However, the demand for finer and finer powders remained quite strong. This demand for ultra-fine powders for MIM (mean around 5 micrometer or less) was fueled by increasing interest in the area of micro-MIM components, the demand for full density parts in the medical field, and the general demand for higher performance stainless steel components. Due to the major improvements (high yields of fine powders) that have been made recently in powder production by Atmix, the use of ultra-fine stainless steel powder has now become a distinct reality. This paper discusses the processing and properties of metal injection molded ultra-fine 316 L stainless steel powders.

India was producing only around a million tonnes of steel {{at the time of its}} independence in 1947. By 1991, when the economy was opened up steel production grew to around 14 million tonnes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fluctuations in raw {{material}} and product prices have caused manufacturers and consumers to experience serious losses in steel sector {{as well as}} in all other sectors. As the number of manufacturers of commodities like coking coal, iron ore and scrap- the main {{raw material}}s of steel manufacturing- is less worldwide and their manufacturers do not want to disclose price in an organized market, their future transaction volumes have not developed sufficiently yet. However, future transaction volumes of non-ferrous metals like aluminum, tin etc. that are used as auxiliary raw materials in steel manufacturing have increased fast in organized markets and such style of future transactions have become important in steel manufacturing in terms of cost management. The London Metal Exchange, one of the leading future commodity markets of world, has an important place in management of price risk in <b>steel</b> manufacturing and <b>consumption</b> of derivative transaction contracts. In this study, causality relationship between the price series of non-ferrous metals used as raw materials in steel manufacturing is examined by using Toda and Yamamoto (1995) causality test procedure.

The emerging patterns of technological and economic changes during the last two to three centuries are shown to portray periodic recurrences at intervals of about half a century. In this sense, the technological substitution processes are related to the long swings in economic development because they identify and describe major and periodic fluctuations in tire historical rate of technological change and accordingly also the secular changes in the rate of economic growth.
