500|$|According to Ragan, who was {{involved}} in the race's largest accident, [...] "Everybody was real racy and I just got into the back of Menard. You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, and I guess he was pushing whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, you usually get wrecked." [...] Harvick blamed the accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing: [...] "The biggest problem is the tandem racing has been <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> these guys to stay attached that some of them haven't raced in pack racing. It's {{going to take a lot}} more patience from a lot of guys who haven't done this before." [...] Nevertheless, Menard thought that the pack style of racing would be a good combination for the Daytona 500 and believed it would be [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "exciting". Four days after the race, NASCAR announced that the pressure relief values in the engine would be increased from [...] to [...] after some drivers complained of overheating issues while they were running in packs. The race had a television audience of 7.46million viewers.|$|E
500|$|According to Rowson, White's first {{advantage}} is that, [...] "The {{advantage of the}} first move has some similarities with the serve in tennis in that White can score an 'ace' (for instance with a powerful opening novelty), he has {{more control over the}} pace and direction of the game, and he has a 'second serve' in that when things go wrong his position is not usually losing." [...] Second, White begins the game with some initiative, although Rowson regards this as a psychological rather than a positional advantage, [...] "and whether it leads to a positional advantage depends on the relative skill of the players." [...] Third, some players are able to use the initiative to [...] "play a kind of powerful 'serve and volley' chess in which Black is flattened with a mixture of deep preparation and attacking prowess." [...] Fourth, [...] "If White wants to draw, it is often not <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> Black to prevent this. This {{advantage is}} particularly acute in cases where there is a possible threefold repetition, because White can begin the repetition without committing to a draw and Black has to decide whether to deviate before he knows whether White is bluffing." ...|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{revealed}} that captain Roy Keane {{would return to}} his midfield role after playing in central defence in their win over Juventus: [...] "It took Roy about 15 minutes to settle into Tuesday's game but once he started {{to make sure he}} could see his opponent, he grasped the role very quickly, in the end, he could have played with a bowler hat and white gloves on it was <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> him. He is a marvellous player and choosing him in defence is certainly an option but Mikaël Silvestre and John O'Shea should be fit and I have a back four in my mind." [...] The final was United's first since the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final and Ferguson was determined to win: That is too long for us, and we are delighted. We have always looked at the League Cup as an extra to blood young players, but the format now has encouraged teams to have a go. We've played Liverpool once in Cardiff – in the Charity Shield – and lost so I hope this time it will be a different result." ...|$|E

500|$|The move 6.Be3 {{takes the}} a7–g1 {{diagonal}} from Black's Bf8 and may in some lines prepare the long castle. After the mandatory 6...Bb4+ White can opt for 7.Nd2 {{to avoid having}} doubled pawns, but he {{must be prepared to}} sacrifice a pawn after 7...Qe7 8.Kf2!? Bxd2 9.Qxd2 Qxe4 10.Bd3 with piece activity for the pawn deficit, because the normal defence 8.Bd3? runs into 8...Qd6! and both the Bd3 and the f4-pawn are attacked. White does not need, however, bother too much about the doubled pawns and after 7.Nc3 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 a peaceful black player might choose the quiet 8...b6!? followed by a normal development with d6/0-0/Bb7/Nd7/Re8/Nc5. Instead of 8...b6 a more adventurous black player could choose 8...Qe7 9.Bd3 f5!? as indicated by Borik, Tseitlin and Lalic, but in his more recent book Moskalenko thinks [...] "this move complicates the game too much". If the black player is neither peaceful nor aggressive, Lalic proposes an alternative with 8...Qe7 9.Bd3 0-0 10.Qd2 and only now that Black has his king safe shall he unleash 10...f5!?, when [...] "it is not <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> White to meet [...] as the two main responses, 11.e5 and 11.exf5, allow Black promising chances with 11...d6 and 11...Nxf4 respectively".|$|E
500|$|... "Lucky Day" [...] is a pop song {{featuring}} {{an upbeat}} rhythm and synths. The song has gathered comparisons to the Katy Perry song [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] (2010) and music by David Guetta for its dance themes. In the introduction Roberts sings [...] "Could it be my lucky day?"; the track continues with [...] "Just light the first spark, {{and watch the}} fireworks explode. Boom, Boom, Baby", {{in what has been}} described by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy as a [...] "60s-swing-meets-East-London vibe". Roberts' voice has been described by Katherine St Asaph of Pop Dust as a [...] "springy" [...] vibrato, with breathy background vocals featuring sounds effect including repeated kissing noises. Roberts sings about falling in love with someone, as she sings: [...] "Aah, say that you love me, say that you need me too... best you ever had. It could be <b>so</b> <b>easy,</b> <b>for</b> you to please me, baby. So how come you tease me?". Roberts discussed the track on her blog, commenting that its lyrical content alludes to a boy that initially does not share the same feelings as his partner, [...] "but in the end you win him over and it's your lucky day. You can take it however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing". Roberts described it as a [...] "romantic reference" [...] with a [...] "down-beat track underneath", and in contrast called the top-line of the track [...] "quite cute and girly". A remix of the song was producer by band White Lies, and debuted on The Guardian. The 90s-themed concept incorporates house music, with [...] "chunky" [...] beats and [...] "twinkly" [...] synths to the original instrumental of the song.|$|E

Farnham {{replaced}} Shorrock on lead vocals and [...] "Man on Your Mind", the third single from Time Exposure (with Shorrock's vocals), reached No.14 in the US. In September Farnham told Susan Moore of The Australian Women's Weekly, [...] "Fitting in with the guys hasn't been hard, they have made it <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> me... But recording and on stage things are quite different from what I've been used to." [...] On covering the previous LRB repertoire he said, [...] "We've had to change the key {{with a lot of}} things because Glenn sang in a different register from me." ...|$|E
