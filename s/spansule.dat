50|$|In October 2010, GlaxoSmithKline {{sold the}} rights for Dexedrine <b>Spansule</b> to Amedra Pharmaceuticals (a {{subsidiary}} of CorePharma).|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{immediate}} release (IR) {{formulations of}} dextroamphetamine sulfate are available generically as 5 mg and 10 mg tablets, marketed by Barr (Teva Pharmaceutical Industries), Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, Wilshire Pharmaceuticals, Aurobindo Pharmaceutical USA and CorePharma. Previous IR tablets {{sold by the}} brand names of Dexedrine and Dextrostat have been discontinued but in 2015 IR tablets became available by the brand name Zenzedi, offered as 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg tablets. Dextroamphetamine sulfate is also available as a controlled-release (CR) capsule preparation in strengths of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg under the brand name Dexedrine <b>Spansule,</b> with generic versions marketed by Barr and Mallinckrodt. A bubblegum flavored oral solution is available under the brand name ProCentra, manufactured by FSC Pediatrics, {{which is designed to}} be an easier method of administration in children who have difficulty swallowing tablets, each 5 mL contains 5 mg dextroamphetamine. The conversion rate between dextroamphetamine sulfate to amphetamine free base is [...]728.|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{patients}} with the narcoleptic syndrome were treated separately with dexamphetamine sulphate tablets 10 and 30 mg, Dexedrine <b>Spansules</b> 10 mg, mazindol 4 mg, and fencamfamin hydrochloride 60 mg daily. Each drug was given for four weeks and the effects compared. In these dosages the reported frequency of attacks of narcolepsy was roughly halved with each treatment, dexamphetamine 30 mg daily being only slightly more potent than 10 mg. The subjective effects of Dexedrine tablets and <b>Spansules</b> could not be distinguished by most patients. Effects on mood, alertness, and sympathomimetic side effects were largely inseparable with all these drugs, but a decrease in appetite was not reported by {{patients with}} narcolepsy...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} and time course of single morning doses of AdderallÂ®, extended-release (<b>Spansules),</b> and immediate-release (tablets) dextroamphetamine sulfate (DXA) and placebo were compared in 35 children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover {{study at the}} Child Psychiatry Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD...|$|R
50|$|Chlorphenamine {{is often}} {{combined}} with phenylpropanolamine {{to form an}} allergy medication with both antihistamine and decongestant properties, though phenylpropanolamine is no longer available in the US after studies showed it increased the risk of stroke in young women. Chlorphenamine remains available with no such risk. Brand names had included Demazin, Allerest 12 Hour, Codral Nighttime, Chlornade, Contac 12 Hour, Exchange Select Allergy Multi-Symptom, A. R. M. Allergy Relief, Ordrine, Ornade <b>Spansules,</b> Teldrin, Triaminic, and Tylenol Cold/Allergy.|$|R
40|$|Crystallo-co-agglomeration (CCA) {{is a novel}} {{particle}} engineering/design technique {{developed by}} Kadam et al, to overcome the limitations of spherical crystallization (SC). Basically, it&#x 2032;s single step process used for size enlargement of single, two or more, small dose or large dose drugs, in combination with or without diluent. The process of CCA involves simultaneous crystallization and agglomeration of drug/s with/without excipients/s from good solvent and/or bridging liquid by addition of a non-solvent. Till date CCA has been applied for spherical agglomeration of talc, bromhexine hydrochloride-talc, ibuprofen-talc, ibuprofen-paracetamol, and naproxen-starch. The spherical agglomerates obtained by CCA {{can be used as}} intact beads (encapsulated <b>spansules)</b> or directly compressible tablet intermediates having satisfactory micromeritic (flowability), mechanical (friability, crushing), compressional (compressibility, compactibility), and drug release properties. Modified drug release from agglomerates and compacts thereof can be achieved using suitable polymer composition in the process design. Thus, it can be concluded that, CCA is a simple and cost effective process, which can be tailor-made for particle design of all majority of drugs and combinations thereof...|$|R
