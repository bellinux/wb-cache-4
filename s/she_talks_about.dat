She finds herself {{drinking}} alone until a stranger {{comes up to}} her and <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> how she wants to be a 'proper mum' to Bobby. When he leaves she asks his name to which he replies, Gabriel. Seeing this as a sign, she tells her friends and family that she is leaving to get Bobby back. Goldie McQueen (Chelsee Healey) also decides to come with her to escape prison and they both leave together after emotional goodbyes to their family.|$|E
5|$|Lewis is {{hired by}} Claudia Colby to {{accompany}} her to the Weatherfield Traders' Association Christmas party. Claudia introduces Lewis to her friend, Audrey Roberts, and he flirts with her. Audrey learns Lewis is a male escort and she later hires him to be her date for the Stylists' Dinner. Audrey contacts Lewis again and invites him {{to have dinner with}} her, but she becomes apprehensive and pretends to be ill when he arrives. Lewis persuades Audrey to let him into her home and he listens while <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> her late husband. They then go out for dinner. Lewis visits the Rovers Return in Coronation Street and pretends not to know Audrey. Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) recognises Lewis from the Christmas party and when he sees Lewis kissing Audrey, he jumps to the conclusion that they are having an affair.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{also uses}} sub-plots {{to offer a}} clearer view {{of the actions of}} the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances. Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious {{contrast}} to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's love and marriage. Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague–Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.|$|E

At Bianca's intervention he admits he still loves Erica. Slowly, Erica and Dimitri work their way into becoming friends. He escorts her to the Crystal Ball in 1998 and they look {{to be on their}} way to a reconciliation. By the time Erica realizes she still loves him, he is presumed dead. During his funeral <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> her and Dimitri as soul mates and acts as though she is his widow. Alexandra Devane Marick reveals that she married Dimitri during his trip to Europe. Erica does not believe Alex is the type of woman Dimitri would ever be with and doubts they were ever married.|$|E
25|$|After her {{conversion}} to the Bábí faith, the poems of Táhirih flourished. In most <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> her longing {{to meet the}} Báb. Her poetry illustrates an impressive knowledge of Persian and Arabic literature which Táhirih possessed, seldom seen in a woman in mid-nineteenth century Iran. One {{of the most famous}} poems attributed to her is named Point by Point. Although it is widely considered her signature poem and a masterpiece, it has been claimed by Mohit Tabátabá'i to be older and by someone else – though in making this claim he offered no proof and any argument to the contrary is not possible in Iran. When Táhirih was killed, hostile family members suppressed or destroyed her remaining poems, whilst her others were spread across Iran. It has been suggested that Táhirih had little interest in putting her poems in print. `Abdu'l-Bahá recalls that when he was aged five Táhirih would chant her poetry to him in her beautiful voice. Edward Granville Browne procured her poems from Bábí, Bahá'í and Azali sources and published them in his book A Year Amongst the Persians.|$|E
25|$|Mary and Cathleen {{return home}} from their {{drive to the}} drugstore, where Mary has sent Cathleen in to {{purchase}} her morphine prescription. Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen {{to go to the}} kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn and her husband’s obvious obsession with money. It is obvious that Mary has already taken some of her “prescription.” <b>She</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> her past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain in her hands is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E

500|$|The song {{begins with}} Stefani's then-husband Gavin Rossdale {{speaking}} in French and then leads {{into the first}} verse. The lyrics describe Stefani talking about [...] "flying first class" [...] and [...] "livin' like a queen". <b>She</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> being luxuriously in love and calls her lover Limousine and Treasure Chest. <b>She</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> the increasing passion {{between her and her}} partner, and says, [...] "Our passion it just multiplies" [...] and [...] "got in the fifth gear, baby". In the chorus she tells that love is getting expensive and she and her partner have to work hard night and day to be rich in love, and after working hard, when they lay back together, they get the payback. After the second verse, the song gets slower and Stefani repeats [...] "Cha-ching, cha-ching" [...] four times alternated with lines talking about getting [...] "hooked up with the love" [...] and [...] "hydroponic love". The song ends with Rossdale speaking more lines in French.|$|E

She says she was happy moving away to live with her guardians, a Welsh couple named Gwen and Will, as they made her feel special, and recalls the happiest day of her life. She remembers how Will would sing [...] "Pretty Baby" [...] to her at night, but says since then everyone she has cared about has died. She finishes by telling Jim that the hospital staff want to send him home, but she fears she {{will not be able to}} cope and concludes she is better on her own.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. The London Free Press listed {{it as one}} of the [...] "best bets" [...] {{to watch}} the evening it originally aired. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the small-town government setting and story lines of the show were working, but felt the writing for the Leslie character has been uneven and that individual situations involving her in [...] "The Reporter" [...] were not funny or effective. Matt Fowler of IGN said the Leslie character was funny, particularly when <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> her failure to remove graffiti penises from a city wall. ("To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises.") But Fowler said the Scrabble subplot between Tom and Ron was [...] "silly," [...] and said the Ron character is too one-note and unfunny.|$|E

500|$|... "Material Girl" [...] {{consists}} of synth arrangements, {{with a strong}} backbeat supporting it. A robotic male voice repeats the hook [...] "Living in a material world". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, the song {{is set in the}} time signature of common time, with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is set in the key of C major, with Madonna's voice spanning from the tonal nodes of C4 to C5. The song has a basic chord progression of F–G–Em–Am-F-G-C in the chorus, while the verses are based on the C mixolydian mode, giving a hip, swing-like mood. The bassline in the song with the post-disco origins is reminiscent of The Jacksons' [...] "Can You Feel It", which appeared on their 1980 album Triumph. Furthermore, the strophes remind of the refrain from Melissa Manchester's hit [...] "You Should Hear How <b>She</b> <b>Talks</b> <b>About</b> You" [...] (1982).|$|E

500|$|... "Go Big or Go Home" [...] {{introduced}} the subplot of restoring the parks department budget through a harvest festival, which {{continued to be}} a major story arc throughout the first seven episodes of the season. It also marked a major development in the romantic subplot between Ann and Chris. Rashida Jones said of her character: [...] "I think women over-correct from their last boyfriends, and Chris is very much the opposite from Mark," [...] a reference to Mark Brendanawicz, a character eliminated the previous season. During one scene at Ann's house, Leslie suggests outlandish and inappropriate ways for Ann to try to seduce Chris into increasing the parks department budget, including wearing a sleeveless tuxedo dress that suddenly bursts open. Amy Poehler said she and Jones improvised much of the scene. Poehler said of the scene, [...] "I think it's really funny how little game (Leslie) has with guys. She's not a fool, it's just not her expertise, so when <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> how to be sexy or hot to get someone's attention, it's always really crazy." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics {{delve into}} Lo's hedonistic {{attempts}} to forget her former boyfriend. According to Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal, the narrator describes her attempts {{to overcome a}} failed relationship through binge eating and alcohol, as indicated in the lyrics about having the munchies, eating Twinkies, and throwing up during the first verse. In the chorus, she sings about drug abuse: [...] "You're gone and I gotta stay high / All the time, to keep you off my mind". According to Adam R. Holz of Plugged In, in the bridge, Lo approaches the theme of [...] "knowing—at some level—just how empty and self-obliterating her choices really are", as <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> needing to take someone home in order to relieve her suffering. The singer confessed to iHeart Radio that the song's bridge is her {{favorite part of the}} track because [...] "that just says everything [...] song is about for me". However, Billboard Jeremy D. Larson considered the song's message untrue because [...] "staying high does not keep anyone off your mind".|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics, {{written by}} Cyrus, Antonina Armato, Tim James and Devrim Karaoglu, have been mistakenly {{interpreted}} {{in a variety}} of ways. The song's protagonist sings in first person perspective while condemning an unspecified subject for wanting to invade her privacy. The majority of reviewers thought the protagonist was referring to a [...] "controlling boyfriend". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times sided with the boyfriend, and believed the song's protagonist was [...] "bullying some poor boy for the sin of wanting to know what <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> with her friends." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe believed the song could have described a number of subjects, such as [...] "a former boyfriend, the media, and even her fans." [...] However, in an interview with Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Cyrus said the song was about [...] "the media" [...] and [...] "how they think they know everything about , when they don't.
