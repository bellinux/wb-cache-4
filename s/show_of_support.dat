5|$|A {{letter of}} support from 120 members of the German parliament, the Bundestag, {{was sent to the}} Russian Ambassador to Germany, Vladimir Grinin. It {{described}} proceedings against the women as disproportionate and draconian. On August 9, 2012, 200 Pussy Riot supporters in Berlin marched, wearing colored balaclavas, in a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the group. Attending the trial, British MP and Shadow Foreign Office Minister for Human Rights, Kerry McCarthy, also backed the group, describing proceedings as “surreal”. Lech Wałęsa criticised the church performance as “tasteless”, but nevertheless wrote to Putin urging him to pardon the women.|$|E
5|$|After a {{promising}} {{start to the}} 1996–97, Everton were beaten six {{times in a row}} after Christmas and Southall resorted to ringing up a phone-in radio show to defend manager Joe Royle from unhappy supporters. Royle dropped Southall from the team despite the <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> though he rejected a transfer offer from Chelsea, who were prepared to double Southall's wages. Caretaker-manager Dave Watson restored Southall to the starting line-up after Royle's resignation, and steered the club away from relegation.|$|E
5|$|In September 1956, the RAF {{received}} its first Vulcan B.1, XA897, which immediately embarked upon a round-the-world tour. The tour {{was to be}} an important demonstration of the range and capabilities of the aircraft, but it also had other benefits in the form of conducting goodwill visits in various countries; in later life Vulcans routinely visited various nations and distant parts of the former British Empire as a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and military protection. This first tour, however, was struck by misfortune; on 1 October 1956, while landing in bad weather at London Heathrow Airport at the completion of the world tour, XA897 was destroyed in a fatal accident.|$|E

5000|$|Like the {{contemporaneous}} {{television program}} Amos 'n' Andy, Beulah {{came under attack}} from many critics, including the NAACP, which accused the <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>supporting</b> stereotypical depictions <b>of</b> black characters with Beulah viewed as a stereotypical [...] "mammy" [...] similar to Aunt Jemima.|$|R
5|$|Kogălniceanu's {{term was}} {{confirmed}} by the 1869 election, after which {{he was able to}} persuade Alecsandri to accept a position as deputy for Roman. The poet, who had been nominated without expressing his consent, cast aside hostility and became one of Kogălniceanu's main supporters in the chamber. Also then, Kogălniceanu blocked the republican gambit of his friend Ion Ghica, the acting Premier. When Carol threatened to leave the country and let he liberals deal with all subsequent problems, Kogălniceanu gathered together the party's moderates in a decisive <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the monarch.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the Sea of Japan in April, Philippine Sea led Task Force 77 as well {{as other}} ships of the 7th Fleet through the Strait of Formosa to the South China Sea. From the Formosa Strait, planes flew in parades over Formosa as part of a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the newly formed nation of Taiwan, in an effort to boost morale of the nation. She steamed back to Korea three days later, in time to lend close air support to UN forces {{throughout}} early 1951 as they faced repeated offensives by the Chinese.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was built under a self-imposed comprehensive minority contracting {{and affirmative action}} package that met the city's 1985 30% hiring rule for public sector projects. Chicago mayor Harold Washington's administration had passed an edict that 30% of the work for public sector projects be set aside for minority and women-owned businesses. In a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for this rule, Stein & Co. and AT adopted the rule for their private development.|$|E
50|$|If {{the union}} has made this {{threshold}} <b>showing</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> then the Board will attempt to work out an agreement between the parties for the scheduling of an election.

5|$|George VI's {{coronation}} at Westminster Abbey {{took place}} on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, Queen Mary attended the ceremony in a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for her son. There was no Durbar held in Delhi for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost {{would have been a}} burden to the government of India. Rising Indian nationalism made the welcome that the royal party would have received likely to be muted at best, and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, when {{a scandal}} forced the {{original}} Republican nominee, Godlove Stein Orth, {{to drop out}} of the gubernatorial race, Harrison accepted the Republican Party's invitation to take his place on the ticket. Harrison centered his campaign on economic policy and favored deflating the national currency. He was ultimately defeated in a plurality by James D. Williams, losing by 5,084 votes out of a total 434,457 cast, but Harrison was able to build on his new prominence in state politics. When the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 reached Indianapolis, he gathered a citizen militia to make a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for owners and management, and helped to mediate an agreement between the workers and management and to prevent the strike from widening.|$|E
5|$|General Atkinson, {{who learned}} in early July that Scott {{would be taking}} command, hoped to bring the war to a {{successful}} conclusion before Scott's arrival. The Americans had difficulty locating the British Band, however, {{thanks in part to}} false intelligence given to them by area Native Americans. Potawatomis and Ho-Chunks in Illinois, many of whom had sought to remain neutral in the war, decided to cooperate with the Americans. Tribal leaders knew that some of their warriors had aided the British Band, and so they hoped that a highly visible <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the Americans would dissuade U.S. officials from punishing the tribes after the conflict was over. Wearing white headbands to distinguish themselves from hostile Natives, Ho-Chunks and Potawatomis served as guides for Atkinson's army. Ho-Chunks sympathetic to the plight of Black Hawk's people misled Atkinson into thinking that the British Band was still at Lake Koshkonong. While Atkinson's men were trudging through the swamps and running low on provisions, the British Band had in fact relocated miles to the north. Potawatomis under Billy Caldwell also managed to demonstrate support for the Americans while avoiding battle.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after their}} accession, William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by {{granting}} him the Earldom of Marlborough and Prince George was made Duke of Cumberland. Anne requested {{the use of}} Richmond Palace and a parliamentary allowance. William and Mary refused the first, and unsuccessfully opposed the latter, both of which caused {{tension between the two}} sisters. Anne's resentment grew worse when William refused to allow Prince George to serve in the military in an active capacity. The new king and queen feared that Anne's financial independence would weaken their influence over her and allow her to organise a rival political faction. From around this time, at Anne's request she and Sarah Churchill, Lady Marlborough, began to call each other the pet names Mrs. Morley and Mrs. Freeman respectively, to facilitate a relationship of greater equality between the two when they were alone. In January 1692, suspecting that Marlborough was secretly conspiring with James's followers, the Jacobites, William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices. In a public <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the Marlboroughs, Anne took Sarah to a social event at the palace, and refused her sister's request to dismiss Sarah from her household. Lady Marlborough was subsequently removed from the royal household by the Lord Chamberlain, and Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at Syon House, the home of the Duke of Somerset. Anne was stripped of her guard of honour; courtiers were forbidden to visit her, and civic authorities were instructed to ignore her. In April, Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes. Mary visited her, but instead of offering comfort took the opportunity to berate Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never saw each other again. Later that year, Anne moved to Berkeley House in Piccadilly, London, where she had a stillborn daughter in March 1693.|$|E

25|$|By working {{together}} the Committee and United Irishmen had in 1793 earned more concessions for Catholics, {{resulting in the}} winding up of the committee and thus an end to their alliance. In a parting <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> the Committee declared its support for parliamentary reform. Emancipation however had still not been secured, and the United Irishmen continued to press for it.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, {{citing a}} lack <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> money, and enrollment, CC {{threatened}} {{to close its}} doors. Former bishop, William Higi, announced {{in the spring of}} 1990 that CC's doors would close {{at the end of the}} school year. The announcement resulted in a strong <b>showing</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from the principal at that time, Dave Worland, which eventually led to the reversal of the decision to close the school's doors.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few months}} before the 1903 meeting of the Society of German Engineers, Oskar von Miller {{gathered}} a small group who supported his desire to found a science and technology museum.

In a <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the Florentine art community, Pablo Picasso {{had one of}} his paintings, Recumbent Woman Reading, {{auctioned}} off on an internationally televised programme. He donated the $105,000 it earned to restoration efforts in Italy. Similarly, Pietro Annigoni and Luciano Guarnieri donated the money they earned from selling 575 colour lithographs (depicting the events surrounding the flood and its aftermath), produced from 13 of their drawings.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009 Mullen {{introduced}} a Private Members' Motion on Human Trafficking calling for, among other things, criminalising the user of prostituted and trafficked women.

5000|$|The PNSR {{proposed}} {{a program of}} corporatism and statism, promising a basic income, full employment, and limits on capitalist profits. It was anticommunist generally, and in particular anti-Soviet, circulating the theory of Jewish Bolshevism while describing its own program as the alternative, [...] "positive", socialism. The party also claimed for itself the banner of Christianity, which it associated with calls for social reorganization and the expulsion or segregation of Romanian Jews. Its Germanophilia and antisemitism were supplemented by <b>shows</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the policies of King Carol II.|$|R
