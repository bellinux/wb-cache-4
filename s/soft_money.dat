5|$|Several {{favorite}} son candidates had delegates {{interested in their}} nomination, although they were seen as having less of a chance of gaining the nomination. Alexander Campbell had represented Illinois in the House of Representatives several years earlier. He {{was seen as a}} pragmatist who represented the Greenback Party's more conservative members. Henly James {{was the head of the}} Grange in Indiana and had served in the state legislature there, but attracted little support outside his own delegation. In the Wisconsin delegation, many favored Edward P. Allis, an industrialist who owned the Reliance Iron Works. Allis was a longtime supporter of <b>soft</b> <b>money,</b> but had no experience in elected office. Finally, Solon Chase of Maine had some support from the New England delegations. Chase was a publisher of a Greenback newspaper, Chase's Inquirer, and had narrowly lost a House election in 1878. Chase was among the most radical of the Greenbackers, attracting support from the party's left-wing members.|$|E
5|$|The {{platform}} {{adopted in}} Omaha was ambitious for its time, {{calling for a}} graduated income tax, public ownership of the railroads, telegraph, and telephone systems, government-issued currency, and the unlimited coinage of silver (the idea that the United States would buy as much silver as miners could sell the government and strike it into coins) at a favorable 16-to-1 ratio with gold. The Republicans nominated Harrison for re-election, and the Democrats put forward ex-President Cleveland; as in 1880, Weaver was confident of a good showing for the new party against their opponents. Harrison had shown some favor to the free silver cause, but his party largely supported the hard-money gold standard; Cleveland was solidly for gold, but his running mate, Adlai Stevenson of Illinois, was a silverite. Against these, the Populist Party stood alone as undisputed partisans of <b>soft</b> <b>money,</b> which Weaver hoped would lead to success in rural areas. Further, as labor disturbances broke out in Homestead, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, Weaver hoped urban laborers would rally to the Populist cause.|$|E
500|$|A September 13, 2000 {{debate between}} Lazio and Clinton proved important. [...] Lazio {{was on the}} warpath against <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> and the amounts of it coming from the Democratic National Committee into Clinton's campaign, and {{challenged}} Clinton to agree to ban <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> from both campaigns. [...] He left his podium and waved his proposed paper agreement in Clinton's face; many debate viewers thought he had invaded her personal space {{and as a result}} Clinton's support among women voters solidified.|$|E

5000|$|An {{honest and}} kind man, Youcai {{does not have}} the gift of the gab but is {{tolerant}} as far as possible. However, his wife Luona has a vicious tongue that spares nobody for no rhyme or reason. On top of that, she covets wealth and power, despising her low-earning husband. She is tyrannical and harsh towards her 70-year-old mother-in-law. Wuyin's septuagenarian father, however, has a [...] "blessed" [...] life. His son and daughter-in-law treasure him. When he moans about his aching body, a massage chair worth a few thousand dollars is delivered immediately to the house. Youcai's mother can only drool in envy. Wuyin has a way with people and he is eloquent. He remains [...] "refined" [...] even in a quarrel, defusing any tense situation with a <b>soft</b> touch. <b>Money</b> is his life, and he can never earn enough. He is ever ready to perform good deeds, but not when they demand his money. Hardworking and frugal, his wife Xiuhua is not one to complain.|$|R
5000|$|Dantalian's Chariot was a British {{psychedelic}} {{rock band}} formed in 1967, [...] led by keyboardist and bandleader Zoot Money, and also featuring Andy Summers (later of The Police). They are best remembered for their single [...] "Madman Running Through the Fields", {{and for their}} live performances, which featured early psychedelic light shows. [...] The band would all wear white robes and kaftans in concert, with all of their equipment painted white, to heighten {{the effect of these}} light shows. [...] The group disbanded in April 1968, with Summers going on to join the <b>Soft</b> Machine and <b>Money</b> joining Eric Burdon & The Animals.|$|R
500|$|The court again {{scrutinized}} {{campaign finance}} regulation in McConnell v. Federal Election Commission (2003). The case {{centered on the}} Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), a federal law that imposed new restrictions on campaign financing. The Supreme Court upheld provisions which barred the raising of <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> by national parties {{and the use of}} <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> by private organizations to fund certain advertisements related to elections. However, the Court struck down the [...] "choice of expenditure" [...] rule, which required that parties could either make coordinated expenditures for all its candidates, or permit candidates to spend independently, but not both, which the Court agreed [...] "placed an unconstitutional burden on the parties' right to make unlimited independent expenditures." [...] The Court also ruled that the provision preventing minors from making political contributions was unconstitutional, relying on Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District.|$|E
500|$|The contest drew {{considerable}} {{national attention}} and both candidates were well-funded. By {{the end of}} the race, Democrat Clinton and Republicans Lazio and Giuliani had spent a combined $90 million, the most of any U.S. Senate race in history. [...] Lazio outspent Clinton $40 million to $29 million, with Clinton also getting several million dollars in <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> from Democratic organizations. [...] Among Clinton antagonists circles, direct mail-based fundraising groups such as the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprung up, sending out solicitations regarding the [...] "carpetbagging" [...] issue: just as one Clinton leaves office, another one runs.|$|E
500|$|During 1999, the McCain-Feingold Act {{once again}} {{came up for}} consideration, this time with <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> {{prohibition}} features in but the issue ads provision out. [...] McConnell challenged McCain to name specific senators who had been corrupted by existing campaign finance practices, but McCain refused. [...] In the end, the same failure to gain cloture befell the legislation again. [...] During that year, McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact this campaign finance reform; McCain was cited for opposing his own party on the bill {{at a time when}} he was trying to win the party's presidential nomination. [...] Indeed, by April 1999 aspects of McCain's 2000 presidential campaign were underway, and his stance regarding the Kosovo War and other issues would take place in that context.|$|E

Each issue also provides additional information on the tobacco companies' political influence, including new analyses of the correlation between these payments and the tobacco-related legislation {{that members of the}} U.

Data reported so far in the 2001 - 2002 election cycle (from January 1, 2001 to January 3, 2003) 1 indicate the tobacco industry has given $ 8, 477, 974 in <b>soft</b> and PAC <b>money</b> to federal candidates, political parties and other political action committees...|$|R
500|$|The Sundays enjoyed {{dressing}} {{well and}} dressing their children well; the family sported expensive but tasteful coats, boots, and jewelry. Nell Sunday also bought land as an investment. In 1909, the Sundays bought an apple orchard in Hood River, Oregon, where they vacationed for several years. Although the property sported only a rustic cabin, reporters {{called it a}} [...] "ranch." [...] Sunday was a <b>soft</b> touch with <b>money</b> and gave away much of his earnings. Neither of the Sundays were extravagant spenders. Although Sunday enjoyed driving, the couple never owned a car. In 1911, the Sundays moved to Winona Lake, Indiana, and built an American Craftsman-style bungalow, which they called [...] "Mount Hood", probably {{as a reminder of}} their Oregon vacation cabin. The bungalow, furnished in the popular Arts and Crafts style, had two porches and a terraced garden but only nine rooms, [...] of living space, and no garage.|$|R
500|$|In 1997, McCain became {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but responded by saying that, [...] "Literally every business in America falls under the Commerce Committee" [...] and that he restricted those contributions to $1,000 and thus {{was not part of}} the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem. [...] In that year, Time magazine named McCain as one of the [...] "25 Most Influential People in America". [...] McCain used his chairmanship to challenge the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns and reduce the number of teenage smokers, increase research money on health studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. [...] The industry spent some $40–50million in national advertising in response; while McCain's bill had the support of the Clinton administration and many public health groups, most Republican senators opposed it, stating it would create an unwieldy new bureaucracy. The bill failed to gain cloture twice and was seen as a bad political defeat for McCain. [...] During 1998 a revised version of the McCain-Feingold Act came up for Senate consideration; in addition to banning <b>soft</b> <b>money,</b> it sought to restrict [...] "issue ads" [...] run by independent groups within 60 days of an election. While having majority support, it was fiercely opposed by Senator Mitch McConnell on free speech and partisan threat grounds, and it again fell victim to a filibuster and failed to gain cloture.|$|E
500|$|Trump officially {{released}} his book The America We Deserve on January 1. Dave Shiflett received credit as co-writer. To promote the book, Trump held a January 5 press conference at Trump Tower, which aired on C-SPAN. [...] He signed books and answered questions from reporters, once asserting, [...] "I {{may be too}} honest to be a politician." [...] Trump's book, consisting of 286 pages, covers Trump's political positions and policy proposals, including strict anti-crime measures, increased pressure on China, fair trade, border control, increased military spending, support for public capital punishment, and the implementation of single-payer health care. [...] It advocates eliminating <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> contributions to political parties and full disclosure of campaign donations to political candidates, but calls {{for the removal of}} limits on the amount of donations, arguing, [...] "f you want to give your life savings to Al Gore, that should be between you, Al Gore and your psychiatrist." [...] In addition, it raises concerns about terrorism, proposing the creation of a national lottery to raise funds for anti-terrorism programs, and offers a choice to North Korea to disarm or face military strikes. [...] The America We Deserve also includes praise for former boxer Muhammad Ali, Teamsters leader James P. Hoffa, as well as Trump's future political opponents Florida governor Jeb Bush and New York governor George Pataki, among others. It cites friendships with baseball player Sammy Sosa and entertainer Sean Combs as making Trump more understanding of racial diversity. Trump later backpedaled his book's praise of Combs after Combs was charged with violating gun laws following a shooting at a New York nightclub. [...] Trump said he did not [...] "know [...] really well." [...] The book condemns Congressman Jerrold Nadler as a [...] "hack" [...] for opposing Trump's development of waterfront real estate in Manhattan, and describes Senator Bob Smith as [...] "the dumbest guy in the U.S. Senate" [...] after he grilled Trump's sister Maryanne Trump Barry on abortion when she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1999 upon her nomination to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. [...] It criticizes Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley as a [...] "phony" [...] for his Senate sponsorship of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that purportedly hurt Trump financially. [...] It also notes the hypocrisy of both an unnamed Senator and an unnamed conservative columnist who each engaged in extramarital affairs at Trump's hotels and resorts while they attacked President Clinton for the Lewinsky scandal. [...] In a scathing review, New York Magazine described the book as inadvertently satirical. Booklist pondered whether Trump was [...] "the only man ever to run for president in order to promote a book." [...] Dave Saltonstall of the New York Daily News, labeled it as autobiographical and reported that it contains [...] "enough details to paint a fairly comprehensive picture of what a Trump presidency might look like." ...|$|E

2500|$|Along with Democratic Representative Marty Meehan, from Massachusetts, Shays co-sponsored the Shays-Meehan bill, {{which was}} {{signed into law}} as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. The American Civil Liberties Union [...] "believes that key {{elements}} of Shays-Meehan violate the First Amendment right to free speech because the legislation contains provisions that would violate the constitutionally protected {{right of the people to}} express their opinions about issues through broadcast advertising if they mention the name of a candidate and restrict <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> contributions and uses of <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> for no constitutionally justifiable reason." [...] The Supreme Court upheld the law in McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, but later overturned key portions of it in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.|$|E
2500|$|During his 1998 reelection campaign, Feingold was outspent by his Republican opponent, Representative Mark Neumann, and {{targeted}} by the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Feingold placed a cap on his own fundraising, pledging not to raise or spend more than $3.8 million (one dollar for every citizen of Wisconsin) during the campaign, and turning away Democratic Party <b>soft</b> <b>money.</b> He requested that several lobby groups, including the AFL-CIO and the League of Conservation Voters, refrain from airing pro-Feingold [...] "issue ads." [...] Some Democrats were angry at Feingold for [...] "putting his career at risk" [...] with these self-imposed limits. Neumann also limited himself to $3.8 million in spending, but allowed <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> {{to be used in}} his favor by outside groups. A strong showing in the Democratic strongholds of Milwaukee and Madison allowed Feingold to win the election by about two percentage points.|$|E
2500|$|Congress enacted Johnson's Great Society {{program to}} fight poverty and hunger. The Watergate Scandal had a {{powerful}} effect of waking up a somewhat dormant Congress which investigated presidential wrongdoing and coverups; the scandal [...] "substantially reshaped" [...] relations between the branches of government, suggested political scientist Bruce J. Schulman. Partisanship returned, particularly after 1994; one analyst attributes partisan infighting to slim congressional majorities which discouraged friendly social gatherings in meeting rooms such as the Board of Education. Congress began reasserting its authority. Lobbying became a big factor despite the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act. Political action committees or PACs could make substantive donations to congressional candidates via such means as <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> contributions. While <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> funds were not given to specific campaigns for candidates, the money often benefited candidates substantially {{in an indirect way}} and helped reelect candidates. Reforms such as the 2002 McCain-Feingold act limited campaign donations but did not limit <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> contributions. One source suggests post-Watergate laws amended in 1974 meant to reduce the [...] "influence of wealthy contributors and end payoffs" [...] instead [...] "legitimized PACs" [...] since they [...] "enabled individuals to band together in support of candidates". From 1974 to 1984, PACs grew from 608 to 3,803 and donations leaped from $12.5 million to $120 million along with concern over PAC influence in Congress. In 2009, there were 4,600 business, labor and special-interest PACs including ones for lawyers, electricians, and real estate brokers. From 2007 to 2008, 175 members of Congress received [...] "half or more of their campaign cash" [...] from PACs.|$|E
2500|$|An {{advocate}} of government restrictions on campaign spending and contributions, McCain made {{campaign finance reform}} a central issue in his 2000 presidential bid. With Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin he pushed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 which banned unlimited donations to national political parties (<b>soft</b> <b>money)</b> and curtailed issue-advocacy ads. Because of McCain and Feingold's involvement, the law is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "McCain-Feingold Act." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{newly formed}} Natural Law Party {{nominated}} scientist and researcher John Hagelin for President and Mike Tompkins for Vice President. The Natural Law Party had been founded in 1992 by Hagelin and 12 others {{who felt that}} governmental problems could be solved more effectively by following [...] "Natural Laws." [...] The party platform included preventive health care, sustainable agriculture and renewable energy technologies. During this and future campaigns, Hagelin favored abortion rights without public financing, campaign finance law reform, improved gun control, a flat tax, the eradication of PACs, a ban on <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> contributions, and school vouchers.|$|E
2500|$|However, Thompson's {{opinion of}} the {{legislation}} changed and he conceded it had not worked as planned, saying [...] "I'm not prepared to go there yet, but I wonder if we shouldn't just take off the limits and have full disclosure with harsh penalties for not reporting everything on the Internet immediately." [...] Thompson {{thought that it was}} right to do away with <b>soft</b> <b>money,</b> that it was right to raise the limits on hard money, but that the limitation on political speech within 30 or 60 days of an election was wrong and the spending limits by outside groups are not working and they both should be repealed.|$|E
2500|$|A {{summary of}} pro-Israel {{campaign}} donations {{for the period}} of 1990–2008 collected by Center for Responsive Politics indicates current totals and a general increase in proportional donations to the US Republican party since 1996. [...] The Center for Responsive Politics' 1990–2006 data shows that [...] "pro-Israel interests have contributed $56.8 million in individual, group and <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> donations to federal candidates and party committees since 1990." [...] In contrast, Arab-Americans and Muslim PACs contributed slightly less than $800,000 during the same (1990–2006) period. In 2006, 60% of the Democratic Party’s fundraising and 25% of that for the Republican Party's fundraising came from Jewish-funded PACs. [...] According to a Washington Post estimate, Democratic presidential candidates depend on Jewish sources for as much as 60% of money raised from private sources.|$|E
5000|$|Contributions made {{directly}} to a specific candidate are called hard money and those made to parties and committees are called <b>soft</b> <b>money.</b> <b>Soft</b> <b>money</b> constitutes an alternative form of financing campaigns {{that emerged in the}} last years. It [...] "derives from a major loophole in federal campaign financing and spending law that exempts from regulation those contributions made for party building in general rather than for specific candidates". There are no limits on <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> and some examples are donations for stickers, posters, and television and radio spots supporting a particular party platform or idea but not a concrete candidate.

The Campaign Integrity Act (H.R. 1867) proposed by Asa Hutchinson (R-Arkansas) put a ban on <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> and raised hard money limits. The Citizen Legislature & Political ACT (H.R. 1922) sponsored by Rep. John Doolittle (R-CA) would repeal all federal freedom ACT election contribution limits and expedite and expand disclosure.

5000|$|Having been {{tailored}} {{to focus on}} issue advocacy and big businesses, BCRA forfeited its chance {{to focus more on}} congressional stagnation. BCRA was more {{tailored to}} combat the seemingly irresistible rise of political <b>soft</b> <b>money,</b> whereas the structural problems in congressional stagnation lie elsewhere. The problems of an enlarged incumbency advantage are the results of a severe imbalance in hard money contributions to the candidates and is not a consequence of a sizable influx of <b>soft</b> <b>money,</b> or third-party issue advocacy. Given the huge advantages that incumbents have, some might say that political tools like <b>soft</b> <b>money</b> and issue advocacy would benefit the underdog challenger, as it could be potentially helpful to them, and could lessen the competition. It follows that any impediment to these alternative sources might prove to work contrary to the revitalization of the political process. BCRA can be seen as such an impediment, and this was why some opponents of BCRA had labeled it as an [...] "incumbency protection act".|$|E
