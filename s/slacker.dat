25|$|Road {{bicycles}} for racing {{tend to have}} a steeper {{seat tube}} angle, measured from the horizontal plane. This positions the rider aerodynamically and arguably in a stronger stroking position. The trade-off is comfort. Touring and comfort bicycles tend to have more slack seat tube angle traditionally. This positions the rider more on the sit bones and takes weight off the wrists, arms and neck, and, for men, improves circulation to the urinary and reproductive areas. With a <b>slacker</b> angle, designers lengthen the chainstay so that the center of gravity (that would otherwise be farther to the back over the wheel) is more ideally repositioned over the middle of the bike frame. The longer wheelbase contributes to effective shock absorption. In modern mass-manufactured touring and comfort bikes, the seat-tube angle is negligibly <b>slacker,</b> perhaps in order to reduce manufacturing costs by avoiding the need to reset welding jigs in automated processes, and thus do not provide the comfort of traditionally made or custom-made frames which do have noticeably <b>slacker</b> seat-tube angles.|$|E

Objective: The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the results of tourniquet use with <b>slack</b> in the strap versus no <b>slack</b> before windlass turning, in order to develop best practices. Methods: The authors used a tourniquet manikin 254 times to measure tour-niquet effectiveness, windlass turns, time to stop bleed-ing, and blood volume lost at 5 degrees of strap <b>slack</b> (0 mm, 25 mm, 50 mm, 100 mm, and 200 mm maximum). Results: When comparing no <b>slack</b> (0 mm) to <b>slack</b> (any positive amount), there were increases with <b>slack</b> in windlass turns (p <. 0001, 3 -fold), time to stop bleeding (p <. 0001, 2 -fold), and blood volume lost (p <. 0001, 2 -fold).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{questions concerning}} <b>slack's</b> nature and its {{relationships with the}} environment and performance. The research investigates which view of <b>slack</b> (the operations or behavioral approach) best predicts performance. It examines the relationship of environment and <b>slack</b> using both interaction and mediation models. The PIMS database was used for 610 assembly manufacturing firms. The results support both the behavioral and the operations perspectives. This combined view suggests that <b>slack</b> capacity is optimized to improve sales while being minimized to improve profits. Excess inventory is minimized to improve sales but optimized to improve average ROS. In all cases, excess cash is minimized. In all equations, the <b>slack</b> variables entered the equations as costs. These results also support the argument that <b>slack</b> interacts with the environment rather than being in a functional relationship with it. Interaction terms of the <b>slack</b> types and the environment were significant in predicting sales. A mediation model was also tested but had a poorer fit with the data. <b>Slack</b> {{was found to be}} a multi-dimensional concept. The <b>slack</b> variables did not all intercorrelate positively. The negative relationships suggest that management makes decisions as when to use each <b>slack</b> resource. The <b>slack</b> variables (when lagged) had significant effects on each other, but not on performance. This indicates that the time horizon for <b>slack</b> may be shorter than was investigated in this research. The research demonstrated that <b>slack</b> inventory and non-slack supply buffers were negatively related. The conditions under which the firm trades <b>slack</b> for other buffering mechanisms were not clear. Predicted positive relationships between size and <b>slack</b> were found except that excess capacity and size were negatively related. This suggests that larger firms were holding <b>slack</b> in ways that are more discretionary and less obvious to their control systems. What is not clear from this research are the conditions under which management will choose a specific type of <b>slack.</b> In one case (excess working capital), technology predicts the level of this variable.
