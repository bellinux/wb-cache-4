25|$|These small 0-4-0 tank engines {{were and}} are the {{standard}} shunter locomotives of the system, built between 1927 and 1937 by the firm of Breda in Milan. They have short side tanks, a rear coal bunker, and a unified, oval dome containing the <b>steam</b> <b>dome</b> inside a larger sand dome. This arrangement, popular worldwide in nations that favored the sand dome, helped both to insulate the <b>steam</b> <b>dome</b> {{and to keep the}} sand dry with the warmth. Large, prominent builder's plates adorn the domes. They utilise Walschaerts valve gear with piston valves and superheating, and are painted in the traditional European style of red below the running board, including frames and wheels, and black above, including boiler, cab, tanks etc. The purpose of the red paint is to make cracks and breakages in the locomotive's important running gear more obvious.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Normand gave a {{particularly}} large heating area (tube surface area) {{in relation to the}} grate area. The cost of this was a dense nest of tubes, where each of the numerous rows of tubes was bent into a different and complex shape. Tube ends entered the cylindrical drums perpendicularly, for good sealing. The space needed for all these tubes filled the entire lower half of the steam drum, requiring both a large drum and a separate <b>steam</b> <b>dome</b> from which to collect dry steam. The external boiler casing entered the flue uptake at one end, usually enclosing this dome. The ends of the drums extended outside the casing as hemispherical domes. Cold downcomers outside the casing linked these drums, providing a path for the return circulation of cold water.|$|E

50|$|Compared to the NGR versions, the IMR {{locomotives}} {{were more}} ornate. In true military tradition, the <b>steam</b> <b>domes,</b> chimney caps and boiler bands were of polished brass. A weatherboard was {{affixed to the}} coal bunker to offer better protection to the crew when travelling bunker forward.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicles}} were {{equipped with a}} two-cylinder, compound engine. The most striking feature was the large, horizontal pipe connecting the two <b>steam</b> <b>domes.</b> Ninety eight engines of this class were built by 1907; they initially had flat slide valves, but from 1903 piston valves were installed.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had {{an inside}} forked frame. The boiler barrel had three shells. On the centre one {{there was a}} large <b>steam</b> <b>dome,</b> which was as tall as the short cylindrical smokestack. The <b>steam</b> <b>dome</b> was decorated with brass bands. The vertical boiler had a safety valve on top.|$|E

25|$|New {{locomotives}} {{were ordered}} in February 1861 from R and W Hawthorn in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, with a layout {{very similar to}} that of a successful 2-4-0 design previously been built for the Great Northern Railway, with modifications such as the fitting of cabs and <b>steam</b> <b>domes.</b>|$|R
50|$|First engines {{had large}} <b>steam</b> <b>domes,</b> open cabs and C16 style tenders. Those built from 1938 onwards, commencing with N°858, had small <b>steam</b> <b>domes,</b> sedan cabs with welded tenders and also larger {{diameter}} (9+1/2 in) piston valves. The {{two types of}} boilers were occasionally interchanged at overhauls and by later years most of the old style ones had been replaced. The last 40 engines, N°961 to N°1000, were fitted with Timken roller bearings and painted brown. They acquired the nickname of Brown Bombers after American boxer Joe Louis. Those overhauled {{in the last years}} of steam operations were repainted black. A number of modifications were carried out over their life including the fitting of large mushroom air snifting valves. Several had additional sandboxes and/or rear headlights fitted at various times for working lines where no turning facilities were available.|$|R
5000|$|A5 No. 58 is {{preserved}} at the Finnish Railway Museum Until the 1920s it pulled passenger trains in southern Finland. In its {{last few years}} of operation it was also used for shunting. A5 locomotives were nicknamed [...] "Lankkihattu" [...] because they were similar to the A6 locomotives, which were had with brass <b>steam</b> <b>domes.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Hunslet Engine Company {{delivered}} three 0-4-0 saddle-tank locomotives to the Eastern System of the Cape Government Railways (CGR) in 1876 and 1877. They {{were similar}} to the 1st Class 0-4-0ST of 1875 in most respects, but instead of domeless boilers which took steam from the steam space above the firebox, they had <b>steam</b> <b>domes</b> with large polished brass covers.|$|R
5000|$|The Baden VI b was {{the first}} German tank {{locomotive}} with a 2-6-2 wheel arrangement. It {{was developed by the}} firm of Maffei for the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railways in order to provide faster services on the Höllentalbahn. As a result, the first six batches were given a firebox sloping to the rear. One striking feature was also the connecting pipe between the two <b>steam</b> <b>domes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had {{a boiler}} barrel, made from two shells, {{as well as}} two <b>steam</b> <b>domes,</b> which were linked by an internal connecting pipe. The boiler feed was achieved using injectors, but from locomotive number 1856 they were given Knorr feed pumps with a preheater located transversely under the boiler. Later the preheater was positioned on the left hand side next to the chimney on all locomotives, which gave them their characteristic appearance. Schmidt superheaters were used.|$|R
50|$|The boiler was {{rivetted}} {{from several}} sections. The outer firebox {{was equipped with}} a semi-circular dome that extended forward over the boiler barrel and acted as a steam collection space. In addition there was a <b>steam</b> <b>dome</b> on the front section of the boiler. The two spring balance safety valves were located on the <b>steam</b> <b>dome</b> and dome of the outer firebox.|$|E

50|$|The first Niagara was Class S-1a #6000 in 1945; the S-1b (6001-6025) were {{delivered}} in 1945-46. The NYC's last steam locomotive was Class S-2 #5500; it had poppet valves. The Niagaras {{did not have}} <b>steam</b> <b>domes,</b> as did most steam locomotives, {{which resulted in a}} smooth contour {{along the top of the}} boiler. A perforated pipe collected steam instead. This was necessary because of the lower loading gauge of the New York Central (15 ft 2 in versus 16 ft for other American railroads).|$|R
50|$|These six {{locomotives}} {{were very}} similar in appearance to the earlier Clara Class, but could be visually identified by their <b>steam</b> <b>domes</b> which were located further forward, closer to their chimneys, {{as well as by}} the different shape of the cutaway at the rear of their frames above their trailing axles. They were named Scotia, Hibernia, Cambria, Canada, Australia and India respectively and were also numbered, in the range from 8 to 10, 12, 14 and 15. They were later described as the Scotia Class.|$|R
50|$|These steam {{locomotives}} {{were brought}} into service, {{after it was}} clear that the Saxon Class I V (later DRG Class 55) could no longer the demands placed on it. The locomotive had a hollow, Klien-Lindner axle at the back and, initially, a long steam collection pipe above the centre of the boiler which was replaced on later models by two <b>steam</b> <b>domes</b> and a connecting pipe. Twenty machines were delivered by the firm of Hartmann as wet steam engines, a further 30 with a Schmidt smoke tube superheater.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, {{the sand}} dome between the <b>steam</b> <b>dome</b> and cab was removed {{along with all}} of its {{associated}} piping.|$|E
50|$|From 1926 to 1934 the ČSD rebuilt five of its 354.0 into {{superheated}} two-cylinder locomotives {{which they}} {{designated as the}} ČSD Class 355.0. These machines were also given a second <b>steam</b> <b>dome</b> and a connecting pipe between the domes. Between 1936 and 1940, the trailing axle on another five engines {{was replaced by a}} bogie; these locomotives then became the ČSD Class 353.1. In 1944 another engine was converted to superheating, but the second <b>steam</b> <b>dome</b> was not used.|$|E
50|$|Until {{photographic}} evidence came {{to light}} which proved differently, it had been believed that this locomotive was the Midland System's Kitson-built no. M22. However, judging from {{the position of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>dome</b> on engine no. 303, depicted after a turntable mishap, it was rebuilt from one of the Beyer, Peacock 1st Class 2-6-0 tender locomotives which had been built by Avonside Engine Company in 1877, on which the <b>steam</b> <b>dome</b> was located further back, closer to the cab.|$|E
50|$|Some {{locomotive}} designers in Britain {{continued to}} use domeless boilers even after the use of <b>steam</b> <b>domes</b> became commonplace. The square-topped Belpaire firebox allows steam to be conveniently collected at its top corners and therefore locomotives with Belpaire fireboxes often dispensed with a dome, for example express engines such as the GWR Castle Class (the large brass boiler fitting on a Castle is the distinctive GWR safety valve cover, not a dome). Ultimately, the restrictive British loading gauge was a major factor which determined {{the size of the}} dome, with large-boilered express locomotives, such as the LNER Class A1, only having space for a very shallow dome.|$|R

At center, a large darkly-colored locomotive can be seen on a railroad track. On the right, a small bell is visible hanging near an exhaust chimney protruding {{from the top of the}} engine's boiler. To the left of the chimney, two <b>steam</b> <b>domes</b> can be seen along the top of the boiler. Along the side of the locomotive, five large wheels and numerous smaller wheels are visible connected with several gears and rods. The locomotive pulls a tender with the words "Southern Pacific" painted on its side. In the foreground, nothing can be seen except for a lone gas tank on a barren field. Text at the bottom of the photograph reads: " 4 - 10 - 2 type 3 -cylinder locomotive {{owned and operated}} by Railway and Locomotive Historical Society, Inc. "...|$|R
50|$|The boiler had a Belpaire firebox with a {{somewhat}} higher top surface. A larger <b>steam</b> <b>dome</b> was fitted {{on top of}} the rear boiler ring.|$|E
50|$|Later batches (from 1887) had a <b>steam</b> <b>dome,</b> and the {{admission}} pipes {{were located in}} the smokebox. Due to {{the addition of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>dome,</b> the location of the sand box and sanders were changed. In addition the quantities of water and coal that could be carried were increased. The back wall of the cab was now straight and the lower section no longer sloped. The length over buffers increased from 8,300 mm to 8,591 mm, the axle load rose to 11 t (see second photo).|$|E
5000|$|A regular {{problem with}} early steam {{locomotives}} {{was that of}} priming, the carry-over of water with the steam. Many varieties of <b>steam</b> <b>dome</b> on the boiler barrel were tried to avoid this, by taking the steam outlet from as high as possible above the waterline. Stephenson's Rocket of 1829 had used such a small <b>steam</b> <b>dome.</b> In the 1830s, domes became extravagantly large. A drawback to fitting such large domes was the weakening of the boiler shell where such a large hole was cut into it.|$|E

50|$|The boiler {{consists}} of one long horizontal transverse drum, {{with a central}} locomotive-style firebox mounted in an extension beneath. The first boilers had a square firebox, but this was later changed to a circular section. Firing with coke is carried out through a firedoor {{in the side of}} the shell, to the rear of the boiler when installed. Fire-tubes lead to a shallow smokebox at each side, from which return tubes pass to a central chamber beneath the chimney. The chimney is wrapped with an extension of the boiler shell, acting as a <b>steam</b> collecting <b>dome.</b> There are 32 tubes in total from the firebox, of 1¾ inch diameter, and 28 more to the chimney chamber. Longitudinal stays support the flat tubeplates at each side. An unusual feature is that rather than the usual single blastpipe beneath the chimney, there are 14 of them on each side inside each smokebox, pointing into the return tubes. Exhaust steam from the engine reaches these blastpipes through a prominent copper pipe on the outside of each smokebox door.|$|R
5|$|Eruptions from Mount Cleveland are {{generally}} vulcanian and strombolian in nature, characterized by short explosive ash clouds sometimes accompanied by a'a flows, lava fountains, pyroclastic flows, ash and <b>steam</b> emissions, lava <b>dome</b> growth, and the ejection of breadcrust bombs. Hot springs were reportedly {{found on the}} volcano in the 1800s, and persistent fumarolic activity was observed in the 1980s and 1990s. Mount Cleveland is a site of persistent steam emissions and thermal anomalies that represent constant background activity. During 2011, a summit lava dome formed, by continuous intrusion of magma at the summit. Late in 2011, nearly 6 explosions demolished the dome. In June 2012, another small dome was observed.|$|R
