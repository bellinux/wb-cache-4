30|$|Continuous {{records of}} past {{geomagnetic}} intensity variations {{during the last}} few million years recovered from marine sediments revealed that paleointensity fluctuations between polarity reversals contain variations with timescales of 104 years and longer (e.g., Guyodo and Valet 1999; Yamazaki and Oda 2005; Valet et al. 2005; Channell et al. 2009; Tauxe and Yamazaki 2015). It is expected that paleomagnetic direction also has <b>secular</b> <b>variations</b> of such timescales. However, discussion on directional <b>secular</b> <b>variations</b> has mostly been for centennial to millennial timescales utilizing datasets during Holocene (e.g., Korte and Constable 2005; Lund et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2009; Constable and Korte 2015). Directional <b>secular</b> <b>variations</b> of 104 or longer timescales, if exist, would have an amplitude of ~ 5 ° or smaller, similar to differences between the time-averaged field {{during the last few}} million years and the geocentric axial dipole (GAD) field. Such variations are close to sampling and measurement errors for studies using sediment cores, and not easy to be detected. To enhance signal-to-noise ratios, precise inter-core correlations among many cores are required, which is also not easy to be performed.|$|R
500|$|The {{main part}} of Earth's {{magnetic}} field is generated in the core, {{the site of a}} dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is , with global magnetic dipole moment of [...] The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes <b>secular</b> <b>variation</b> of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years.

2500|$|In navigation, {{directions}} on maps are usually expressed {{with reference to}} geographical or true north, the direction toward the Geographical North Pole, the rotation axis of the Earth. Depending on where the compass {{is located on the}} surface of the Earth the angle between true north and magnetic north, called magnetic declination can vary widely with geographic location. The local magnetic declination is given on most maps, to allow the map to be oriented with a compass parallel to true north. The location of the Earth's magnetic poles slowly change with time, which is referred to as geomagnetic <b>secular</b> <b>variation.</b> [...] The effect of this means a map with the latest declination information should be used. [...] Some magnetic compasses include means to manually compensate for the magnetic declination, so that the compass shows true directions.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is devoted to}} the effects of nonadiabatic resonant dynamic tides generated in a uniformly rotating stellar component of a close binary. The companion is considered to move in a fixed Keplerian orbit, and the effects of the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force are neglected. Semi-analytical solutions for the linear, nonadiabatic resonant dynamic tides are derived by means of a two-time variable expansion procedure. The solution at the lowest order of approximation consists of the resonantly excited oscillation mode and displays a phase shift with respect to the tide-generating potential. Expressions are established for the <b>secular</b> <b>variations</b> of the semi-major axis, the orbital eccentricity, and the star's angular velocity of rotation caused by the phase shift. The orders of magnitude of these <b>secular</b> <b>variations</b> are considerably larger than those derived earlier by Zahn (1977) for the limiting case of dynamic tides with small frequencies. For a 5 M ⊙ ZAMS star, an orbital eccentricity e = 0. 5, and orbital periods in the range from 2 to 5 days, numerous resonances of dynamic tides with second-degree lower-order g + -modes are seen to induce <b>secular</b> <b>variations</b> of the semi-major axis, the orbital eccentricity, and the star's angular velocity of rotation with time scales shorter than the star's nuclear life time...|$|R

50|$|The <b>secular</b> <b>variation</b> of a {{time series}} is its {{long-term}} non-periodic variation (see Decomposition of time series). Whether something {{is perceived as a}} <b>secular</b> <b>variation</b> or not depends on the available timescale: a <b>secular</b> <b>variation</b> over a time scale of centuries may be part of a periodic variation over a time scale of millions of years. Natural quantities often have both periodic and secular variations. <b>Secular</b> <b>variation</b> is sometimes called secular trend or secular drift when the emphasis is on a linear long-term trend.|$|E
50|$|Geo{{magnetic}} <b>secular</b> <b>variation</b> {{refers to}} changes in the Earth's magnetic field. The field has variations on time scales from milliseconds to millions of years, but rapid changes mostly come from currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere. The <b>secular</b> <b>variation</b> is the changes over periods of a year or more, reflecting changes in the Earth's core. Phenomena associated with this <b>secular</b> <b>variation</b> include geomagnetic jerk, westward drift and geomagnetic reversals.|$|E
50|$|Archaeomagnetic dating {{requires}} an undisturbed feature {{that has a}} high likelihood of containing a remnant magnetic moment from the last time it had passed through the Curie point. This involves sufficient mass to take samples from, and a suitable material with adequate magnetite to hold the remnant magnetism. In addition, the feature {{needs to be in}} an area for which a <b>secular</b> <b>variation</b> curve (SVC) exists. Once the paleodirections of enough independently dated archaeological features are determined, they can be used to compile a <b>secular</b> <b>variation</b> record for a particular region, known as an SVC. The Archaeomagnetic Laboratory at the Illinois State Museum has <b>secular</b> <b>variation</b> curves for the southwest, mid-continent and southeast United States. Additional data points from archaeomagnetic samples with corresponding dating techniques such as tree ring dating or carbon-14 dates, help refine the regional curves.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Secular</b> <b>variations</b> of the {{geomagnetic}} field have been {{measured with a}} continuously improving accuracy {{during the last few}} hundred years, culminating nowadays with satellite data. It is however well known that the dynamics of the magnetic field is linked to that of the velocity field in the core and any attempt to model <b>secular</b> <b>variations</b> will involve a coupled dynamical system for magnetic field and core velocity. Unfortunately, there is no direct observation of the velocity. Independently of the exact nature of the abovementioned coupled system – some version being currently under construction – the question is debated in this paper whether good knowledge of the magnetic field can be translated into good knowledge of core dynamics.

30|$|Age {{control of}} the core {{sections}} is based on calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy, planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphy, or strontium isotope (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) stratigraphy (Table 1). The sections of the paleomagnetic measurements are at the same depths as, or nearby to the horizons of microfossil analyses or isotope measurements, or they are between two horizons of age determination. The ages of the studied samples range from the Eocene to late Miocene. The timescale of Gladstein et al. (2004) {{was used in this}} study.

Using a continuous inclination record for the last 2  m.y., a possibility of orbital influence on inclination variations was argued (Yamazaki and Oda 2002; Roberts et al. 2003). Correlation between paleointensity and inclination was also investigated using some records from this region, and a model explaining the correlation was proposed (Yamazaki and Oda 2002, 2004; Yamazaki 2002). For {{better understanding of the}} geomagnetic field behavior of 104 year and longer timescales, further accumulation of datasets with global site distribution is required.
