A complete application, {{as opposed to a}} computational kernel, Ocean is often used as a representative of a well-tuned parallel program in architectural studies. However, we find there is a danger in using Ocean to evaluate proposed enhancements that purport to either improve scalability or reduce synchronization overhead. The default Ocean code contains an ill-advised code segment that <b>seriously</b> <b>handicaps</b> its “base” performance in common architectural studies. We provide the one-line fix for the offending code that improves performance by as much as a factor of 2. 3, and suggest that architecture researchers using Ocean to evaluate their new ideas—especially when discussing scalability or synchronization—change their code immediately.

40|$|The {{competence}} of over 300 Science Foundation students in five important problem-solving strategies was {{studied at the}} North-West University {{over a period of}} three years.

The results showed that their competence in the use of intellectual strategies was very poor. This lack of competence could be expected to lead to lack of self-confidence and could also <b>seriously</b> <b>handicap</b> their learning throughout their courses.

With the use of an additional mixer port in the proposed transceiver architecture, it provides a capability to combine the up and down converter in the same circuit with better performance. The mixer is powered at 2 V and drains 5 mA. The IIP 3 and single side band Noise Figure is 5 dBm and 18 dB@ 2 MHz. The conversion gain of the mixer is 9 dB for down conversion and the conversion loss is 18 dB for up conversion...|$|R

40|$|BitTorrent [1] {{is popular}} file-sharing tool, {{accounting}} {{for a significant}} proportion of Internet traffic. Files are divided into fragments and transferred out of order among nodes trying to download them. Individual nodes penalize and reward other nodes, adjacent in the BitTorrent overlay, depending on how willing others are to share data. This incentives scheme and the subsequent enforcement of sharing is credited with making BitTorrent outperform other contemporary file-sharing systems. Nonetheless, BitTorrent builds its overlays by randomly selecting peers, a fact that has the potential to <b>seriously</b> <b>handicap</b> both individual performance and waste global network resources. This paper investigates a scheme which attempts to build a more intelligent overlay network, particularly using synthetic network coordinates to select overlay peers that are close by in the underlying network. We evaluate our techniques both from the network’s perspective (resources used) and from the individual’s perspective (average time to complete a download). In both cases, our results show that better peer selection can lead to improved performance with no major changes to the basic BitTorrent protocol. Our evaluation is based on real-world experiments performed over Planet-Lab [2]...|$|R
40|$|Summary Lymphatic {{filariasis}} (LF), already {{recognized as}} a widespread, <b>seriously</b> <b>handicapping</b> disease of adults, was generally thought to occur only sporadically in children. New, highly sensitive diagnostic tests (antigen detection, ultrasound examination) now reveal, however, that LF is first acquired in childhood, often {{with as many as}} one-third of children infected before age 5. Initial damage to the lymphatic system by the parasites generally remains subclinical for years or gives rise only to non-specific presentations of adenitis/adenopathy; however, especially after puberty the characteristic clinical features of the adult disease syndromes (lymphoedema, hydrocoele) manifest themselves. Recognizing that LF disease starts its development in childhood has immediate practical implications both for management and prevention of the disease in individual patients and for the broader public health efforts to overcome all childhood illnesses. For the new World Health Organization (WHO) -supported, public-/private-sector collabor-ation (Global Alliance) to eliminate LF through once-yearly drug treatment, this recognition means that children will be not only the principal beneficiaries of LF elimination but also a population particularly important to target in order for the programme to achieve its twin goals of interrupting transmission and preventing disease...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{focuses on}} some issues of {{contention}} concerning the widely commented shift from a teacher-centered to a learner-centered approach in ELT. It {{is based on the}} premise of building learner autonomy [Holec, 1981] that is expected to result in enhancing learners⿿ motivation. However, practical observations show that the attempts to introduce the learner autonomy principle in Bulgarian education is only partly successful. This raises the question: ⿿Why is it so?⿿ The author suggests that a possible explanation may lie in the specifics of the Bulgarian national culture that does not comply with the methodological concept of learner autonomy. This leads to a more general question: ⿿Are all cultures equally suited to allow the implementation of teaching and learning methods based on autonomy?⿿ The issue is critically discussed by analyzing the Bulgarian national culture along the cultural dimensions in Hofstede's Theory of organizations and cultures. [Hofstede, 2010] where culture {{is considered to be a}} kind of software of the mind that determines every individual's social behavior. The author analyzes the concept of autonomy along the lines of the Bulgarian cultural specifics that influence the relations between the teacher and the student as an archetypal social pair. In conclusion it is suggested that particular national cultures can either facilitate or <b>seriously</b> <b>handicap</b> the implementation of learner autonomy in the respective education system...|$|R

40|$|The {{telephony}} over IP (ToIP) {{is becoming}} a new trend in technology widely used nowadays in almost all business sectors. Its concepts rely on transiting the telephone communications through the IP network. Today, this technology is deployed increasingly what the cause of emergence of companies is offering this service as Switzernet. For several highly demanded destinations, recently fake vendors appeared in the market offering voice termination but providing only false answer supervision. The answered signal is returned immediately and calls are being charged without being connected. Different techniques are used to keep the calling party on the line. One of these techniques is to play a record of a ring back tone (while the call is already being charged). Another, more sophisticated technique is to play a human voice randomly picked up from a set of records containing contents similar to: hello, hello, I cannot hear you Apart {{the fact that the}} fallaciously established calls are charged at rates of real calls, such malicious routes <b>seriously</b> <b>handicap</b> the switching process.

40|$|If {{people are}} going to live longer, then the {{community}} will have a larger proportion of old people. This is true, but only if other things remain the same, and especially if birth rates remain the same. Rising birth rates could counteract improved survival. In fact birth rates have fallen, in the GDR as in other industrialized countries, so to the survival effect is added a low birth rate effect, and the latter is the major component of aging as it is actually occurring. What aging has taken place so far, in the GDR as elsewhere in the industrialized world, is slight compared with what is expected to take place before the new century is much advanced. The relatively high births that followed World War II are now adults moving towards the middle working years, and aging will intensity in the future. The people born in the late 1940 s and 1950 s offer plentiful experienced labor, and that has always been a clear advantage for production. But when technology moves very rapidly experience may become inapplicable, and the question is then whether people at middle ages can unlearn what they know and develop new skills. If they are slow to do so the shortage of young people will <b>seriously</b> <b>handicap</b> production. This and allied questions are not directly addressed in the present paper, but it does provide the demographic framework for their analysis. The population problem, wherever there is one, shows itself as tendencies that will develop their acutest form in the future. That is why so much of demography is concerned with projections or forecasts. The prospects for industry with its presently aging labor force, the prospects for the overall efficiency of the economy when large numbers start to retire about 2015, the social as well as the economic consequences of an aging society, these are the issues that underly the considerations of this paper.
