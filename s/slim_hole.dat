50|$|The first project {{handled by}} Crescent was the Mubarek Field {{off the coast}} of UAE. Within 13 months from the discovery, it was on full {{production}} at a rate of over 60,000 barrels of oil per day, with the drilling of three additional wells, the installation of the processing platform, an additional well-head platform, export loading terminal, and associated support structures and pipelines. This was a world record at the time for bringing an offshore field on-stream from oil discovery. Crescent Petroleum has also earned several operational world records including the deepest short radius horizontal section drilled, and the deepest <b>slim</b> <b>hole</b> to be cased by expandable casing. Since the start of production in 1974, the Mubarek Field has undergone several development phases. The initial phase of the development of Ilam/Mishrif oil reservoir, at a depth of 3800 m was completed in 1977. Development of the Thamama gas condensate reservoir, at a depth of 4700 m, was started in 1987 for production of the gas and condensate. A central gas processing facility was established in the early 1990s, and gas export to Jebel Ali through a 150 km offshore pipeline was constructed. In late 2005, the company commenced a program of drilling further infill wells to increase production of petroleum.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} discharge characteristics of <b>slim</b> <b>holes</b> compared to production wells. Assuming that (1) the boreholes feed from an all-liquid zone, and (2) the feedzone pressure and temperature are independent of borehole diameter, calculations {{have been carried out}} for a variety of borehole diameters. The wellhead pressure/flowrate relationships for the various borehole diameters do not collapse to a single curve, even when flow rates are adjusted to account for differences in cross-sectional area. The area-scaled discharge rate declines with a decrease in borehole diameter. Both frictional pressure gradient and heat loss effects are more significant for the smaller-diameter <b>slim</b> <b>holes</b> than for the larger-diameter wells. The difference in heat loss effects is probably responsible, at least in some cases, for the difficulty encountered in inducing deep <b>slim</b> <b>holes</b> (depths >> 300 m) to discharge. Scaling up the discharge capacity of <b>slim</b> <b>holes</b> to those of production wells by the cross-section area ratio provides a conservative estimate of production-size hole discharge...|$|R

The <b>slim</b> <b>holes</b> were drilled to {{investigate}} the geologic conditions, thermal regime and productive characteristics of the geothermal system.

30|$|Due to the <b>slim</b> <b>hole</b> at {{the lower}} part of the ultra-deep and deep wells, the {{eccentricity}} and rotation of drill string and drilling fluid properties have great effects on the annular pressure drop. This leads to the fact that conventional computational models for predicting circulating pressure drop are inapplicable to hydraulics design of deep wells. With the adoption of helical flow theory and H-B rheological model, a computational model of velocity and pressure drop of non-Newtonian fluid flow in the eccentric annulus was established for the cases where the drill string rotates. The effects of eccentricity, rotation of the drill string and the dimensions of annulus on pressure drop in the annulus were analyzed. Drilling hydraulics was given for an ultra-deep well. The results show that the annular pressure drop decreases with an increase in eccentricity and rotary speed, and increases with a decrease in annular flow area. There is a great difference between static mud density and equivalent circulating density during deep well drilling.|$|E
40|$|As our {{geothermal}} fields {{mature and}} the inevitable problems arise with their exploitation, it will be reservoir engineers that will evaluate our possible future courses of action in order to solve these problems. But first they must have the right tools and data. To date, the best reservoir engineering tool we have in geothermal is the reservoir simulators. The {{reason for this is}} our severe lack of definition of reservoir parameters. Within a simulation there are checks and balances on the interrelation of reservoir parameters that keep the result within certain realistic bounds. These uncertain parameters make most traditional reservoir engineering methods such as volumetrics of little use for anything beyond preliminary work. Parametric studies such as those by Mike Shook help in determining the range and sensitivity of unconstrained variables in simulator work and are valuable. However, as two non-unique simulations can yield similar results on an established field configuration, the same two can then give different results if used for investigating different future scenarios, injection cases or other what-if's. Therefore to use simulators as a development or management tool with greater confidence, a more unique solution is desired, requiring greater definition of the parameters input into the model. By determining these parameters a greater assortment of reservoir engineering methods also becomes available. However, I do not see enough research directed to determining these parameters at this time, and there should be more. These parameters and other methods will be needed to use in the important <b>slim</b> <b>hole</b> evaluations being researched, as simulations are more for developed producing fields with some history, not exploration prospects. One {{of the best ways to}} get some of these parameters is by logging methods. The <b>slim</b> <b>hole</b> tools discussed by Peter Lysne on Tuesday afternoon will be needed to get these parameters in exploration prospects. Besides a natural gamma ray spectrometry tool I see a neutron tool as a first choice, and a resistivity tool as a second choice that will also be needed as a minimum logging suite. The research that is needed soon, rather than later, is what Peter was calling inversion technology, and what I would call the calibration of logging responses to geothermal reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|Keeping the {{drilling}} fluid {{equivalent circulating density}} in the operating window between the pore and fracture pressure is a challenge, particularly when the gap between these two is narrow, such as in offshore, extended reach, and <b>slim</b> <b>hole</b> drilling applications usually encountered in shale gas and/or oil drilling. To overcome this challenge, accu-rate estimation of frictional pressure loss in the annulus is essential. A better estimation of frictional pressure losses will enable improved well control, optimized bit hydraulics, a better drilling fluid program, and pump selection.

The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a set of guidelines for the optimal well control operations, by integrating current best practices through a decision-making system based on Artificial Bayesian Intelligence. Best well control practices collected from data, models, and experts ' opinions, are integrated into a Bayesian Network BN to simulate likely scenarios of its use that will honor efficient practices when dictated by varying operation, kick details, and kick severity. The proposed decision-making model follows a causal and an uncertainty-based approach capable of simulating realistic conditions on the use of well control operations. For instance, as the user vary the operation, rig and crew capabilities, kick details (such as <b>slim</b> <b>hole,</b> deviated or horizontal well), the system will show the optimum practices for circulation method.

From this point of view T 2 Well-EWASG can effectively be used as a tool which allows an improvement of reservoir engineering activities. Finally, the huge amount of data managed during these activities has permitted to test and project the improvement of pre- and post- processing tools specific for TOUGH 2 created by the geothermal research group of DICAM.

This high-power slim-hole drilling system drills much faster than conventional slim-hole motor and bit combinations and holds significant potential to reduce slim-hole drilling costs. The oil and gas industries have been faced with downward price pressures since the 1980 s. These pressures {{are not expected to}} be relieved in the near future. To maintain profitability, companies have had to find ways to reduce the costs of producing oil and gas. Drilling {{is one of the more}} costly operations in the production process. One method to reduce costs of drilling is to use smaller more mobile equipment. Slim holes have been drilled in the past using this principle. These wells can save money not only from the use of smaller drilling equipment, but also from reduced tubular costs. Stepping down even one casing size results in significant savings. However, slim holes have not found wide spread use for three reasons. First, until recently, the price of oil has been high so there were no forces to move the industry in this direction. Second, small roller bits and motors were not very reliable and they drilled slowly, removing much of the economic benefit. The third and final reason was the misconception that large holes were needed everywhere to deliver the desired production. Several factors have changed that will encourage the use of slim holes. The industry now favors any method of reducing the costs of producing oil and gas. In addition, the industry now understands that large holes are not always needed. Gas, in particular, can have high production rates in smaller holes. New materials now make it possible to manufacture improved bits and motors that drill for long periods at high rates. All that remains is to gather all the elements together and demonstrate the savings of <b>slim</b> <b>hole</b> drilling...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{interest}} in extraterrestrial subsurface exploration has prompted {{an examination of}} advanced technologies for drilling <b>slim</b> <b>holes</b> and obtaining geophysical data in these holes. The borehole surveys with geophysical measurements called "logging", complement, and under favorable conditions, replace soil sampling. Very shallow drilling systems were used extensively during the Apollo lunar missions, and are {{in the planning stages}} for use on Mars. The prime objective is to gather scientific data, but these data could eventually provide a basis for the commercial use of space mineral resources. Given the strong scientific {{interest in}} water on Mars and the Moon, subsurface characterization with geophysical methods is attractive, because these methods can cover a much larger volume than soil sampling. Space technology has boosted the development of borehole geophysical instruments because both in space and in boreholes the instruments have to function in hostile environments, in confined spaces, {{and to be able to}} withstand large g-forces. This paper reviews oil industry drilling and geophysical borehole techniques that could be adopted for space applications. Coiled tubing drilling has many advantages because the surface facilities are compact, and an electrical cable in the tubing can transmit power and data. Moreover geophysical sensors can be embedded in the drill collars, which ensures that measurements are carried out while drilling, and this avoids risky reentry of geophysical tools in the hole. If kevlar is used for the coiled tubing, a laser beam could be transmitted via optic fibers in the coiled tubing wall. Using this beam to cut the rock would virtually eliminate mud and downhole motor requirements, and save a lot of weight. The quest for water and the strict [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{calculations}} {{have been}} performed to estimate the electrical generating capacities of small-diameter geothermal wells for off-grid rural electrification using wellhead generators. In these applications, generating capacities of interest are typically in the range 100 - 1000 kWe. The approach amounted to (1) calculating the “wellhead discharge characteristics” (water/steam discharge rates as functions of wellhead pressure) {{for a variety of}} hypothetical well and reservoir descriptions, (2) employing a mathematical representation for the net generating capacity of a wellhead powerplant as a function of its operating inlet pressure and steam inlet rate, and (3) varying the wellhead (= turbine inlet) pressure to identify the “optimum” pressure value at which the net electrical power is maximized. Calculations were carried out for well diameters from 75 mm to 300 mm, for well depths from 300 to 1200 meters, for reservoir temperatures from 100 °C to 240 °C, for piezometric surface depths (related to shut-in reservoir pressure) from zero to 250 meters, and for downhole productivity indices from 2 kg/s/bar to infinity. A few cases were also included in which the CO 2 content of the reservoir fluid was non-zero (up to 1 % by mass in the brine). Both backpressure and condensing single-flash steam turbine powerplants were considered. The study was restricted to vertical wells of uniform inside diameter and to all-liquid in-situ reservoir fluids. Over fifteen thousand combinations of the above parameters were examined. The results indicate that <b>slim</b> <b>holes</b> as small as 100 mm inside diameter penetrating reservoirs with temperatures as low as 150 °C can produce useful amounts of electrical power using condensing wellhead turbines (> 100 kWe). For higher reservoir temperatures, the electrical capacity of such a well can exceed one megawatt...|$|R
40|$|Elementary {{concepts}} of seismic wave properties are reviewed {{to establish a}} framework for discussing seismic noise and its suppression. A liberal number of references is included for {{those who wish to}} pursue the topic in detail. A base motion noise level is established for a single surface seismometer. It is argued that simple array processing and seismometer burial should regularly permit us to approach this base noise level which is found in areas free of conspicuous man-made seismic noise sources. The sensitivity of the base seismic level to a number of common disturbances is presented. Solutions that promise to hold the "effective" seismic noise at a site near the base level are given for acoustic, meteorological and fixed local surface sources. Guidelines are suggested for controlling other local man-made sources, e. g. vehicular traffic, by keeping them at sufficiently large distances away from the seismometers to keep noise at permissible levels. These guidelines are speculative and conservative. They should be the subject of future study. The ability to process against general local activity, drilling, and intra- mine sources is limited. Certainly no dramatic gain is to be expected. When strong man-made and/or intramine noise sources are not controllable, detection may well be impossible to achieve, unless the seismometer can be moved close enough to the suspected miner position, i. e. via very deep holes, to compensate for the likely vast differences in strength of the miner signal and the uncontrollable man-made noise sources. However, many intramine sources, e. g., falling water, rock bursts, explosions, etc., may well preclude the existence of a hale miner in their vicinity, and therefore any need to attempt detection of a miner at such locations. The following recommendations are made to enhance the detection and location of a miner signaling seismically. They are: 1. Seismometer burial in <b>slim</b> <b>holes.</b> 2. Narrow band detection, using multiple narrow band filters to cover the likely signal band. 3. Broadband recording and analysis for time-of-arrival estimation...|$|R
