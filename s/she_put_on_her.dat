Although McGurk praises the book's description of the est seminars, noting that it [...] "present {{a clear picture of}} the process", he also criticizes Fenwick's subsequent analysis, saying she [...] "sounds like a different person" [...] than in the first section. [...] McGurk writes that [...] "It's as though <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> psychoanalytically oriented, professional hat and ran a tape that was far from being effective." [...] A review in Publishers Weekly states that Fenwick's [...] "inbred detachment may have kept her from the full impact of the 'experience' the training was meant to be (and is for many)". [...] Even so, the review notes that Fenwick [...] "scores heavily" [...] in the section where she questions the nature of the est training and Erhard's background; it recommends that Getting It be read alongside Luke Rhinehart's The Book of est.|$|E
2500|$|While {{continuing}} to choose her subjects from her immediate urban environment, Fish changed her approach roughly {{at the turn}} of the century. Closely observed objects such as sections of floor tile and asphalt siding gave way to abstractly rendered thresholds, stairs and stair landings, a light fixture, and floor plans of rooms in her home. Like her earlier work, these paintings, she said, were impressed on the surface of the canvas in a way that approximated the experience of seeing the same things over and over, day after day. She came to see transitions as the subject of her work, the sense of walking across a threshold, moving from room to room; or the sense of light moving through a room during the day and into it from a wall fixture at night. She understood such transitions to be both actual and metaphorical. The visual elements <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> canvases were meant to convey physical objects but also her own motion through the spaces they represented and the light that came from fixtures in the rooms and through the windows. The result could be seen, as one reviewer said, [...] "as a thoughtful meditation on the nature of occupancy within a domestic environment, exactingly rendered in multiple paint layers." ...|$|E

5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, {{music critic}} Scott Yanow {{wrote of the}} album [...] "A top singer for 23 years at that point, {{she was at the}} peak of <b>her</b> powers... <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> usual show of the period, {{uplifting}} the ballads and swinging the faster material." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I say is {{that people}} should be good-natured. She can't stand being chaffed. <b>She</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> grand airs. <b>She</b> won't take a bit of a joke from people as good as herself anyway. We are a plain lot. We don't like it. And that's how trouble begins." ...|$|R

60|$|Indeed--the light {{being very}} dim--Maria {{could not see}} the {{brilliant}} glow that lit up the jongejuffrouw's cheeks as with somewhat febrile gestures <b>she</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> dress and smoothed her hair.|$|E

40|$|Mon wore a dark pair {{of jeans}} and a light yellow and pink shirt with decorations of flowers. Her nails are well cared for. Her hair was short and curly; they hide almost all of <b>her</b> ears. <b>She</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{rectangular}} glasses from time to time, mostly to read and write. She wears a smooth silver wedding band <b>on</b> <b>her</b> left hand. Behind her is the com-puter where she works at; being idle, it displays pictures of her family, mostly the very small and cute grandkids...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> had <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> fascinator hood, but {{her hands}} and wrists were bare. She {{struggled}} away <b>on</b> a log, <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> knee <b>on</b> it in a comically resolute style.|$|R
50|$|La Parisienne is a {{painting}} in oils on canvas completed in 1874, {{signed and dated}} by the artist. It shows {{a young woman in}} a long layered dress of a striking deep blue, her face turned to the viewer as <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> gloves. Originally the painting had as its background a doorway in the upper left and a curtain at the upper right, but these were subsequently painted out by Renoir before its first exhibit. This leaves the central figure almost floating in a neutral space, uncluttered by detail.|$|R
