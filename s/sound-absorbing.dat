500|$|Measured in the {{interior}}, {{the chapel}} is [...] long, [...] wide at its transepts, and [...] high at the crossing. Most {{of the interior}} is limestone, but the aisles and the central area of the choir are Aquia Creek sandstone. <b>Sound-absorbing</b> tile is mounted on parts of the wall and vault. Running west to east, the main sanctuary consists of a narthex, a gallery, a nave, two transepts joined by a crossing, and an elevated choir; it seats almost 2,000. The building's southeast corner houses a vestry.|$|E
2500|$|The 787 {{is powered}} by two engines; these engines use all-electrical bleedless systems, {{eliminating}} the superheated air conduits normally used for aircraft power, de-icing, and other functions. As part of its [...] "Quiet Technology Demonstrator 2" [...] project, Boeing adopted several engine noise-reducing technologies for the 787. These include an air inlet containing <b>sound-absorbing</b> materials and exhaust duct cover with a chevron-toothed pattern on the rim for a quieter mixing of exhaust and outside air. Boeing expects these developments to make the 787 significantly quieter both inside and out. [...] The noise-reducing measures prevent sounds above 85 decibels from leaving airport boundaries.|$|E
2500|$|Standard {{convenience}} equipment {{included a}} two-tone padded dashboard with a three-pod instrument cluster, electric windshield wipers and washers, a 200km/h speedometer, side marker lights, four-way hazard lights, antitheft steering column locking mechanism, base steering wheel, brake system warning light, AM radio {{with a single}} in-dash speaker, front ashtray, cigarette lighter, locking glove box with [...] "RAMBLER" [...] emblem on the door, padded sunvisors, day/night rearview mirror, cardboard-type <b>sound-absorbing</b> and heat-isolating headliner, round dome light, dual coat hooks, flip-open rear side vents, full carpeting, driver's side rubber floor mat sewed to the carpet, front bench seat with split folding backs on two-door sedan or with a fixed back on the four-door, bench rear seat, two-point front seatbelts, dual rear ashtrays, front and rear side armrests, vinyl-cloth upholstery on seats and side door panels, aluminum grille, backup lights, steel wheels with center hubcaps, dual [...] "232 SIX" [...] rear quarter panel emblems, dual [...] "bulleye" [...] emblems on the lower corner of the rear side vents, script [...] "American" [...] emblems on both front fenders, capital-lettered [...] "RAMBLER" [...] rectangular emblem between the right taillight and the gas filler, non-locking gas cap, manual driver's side remote mirror, and radio antenna.|$|E

50|$|Because all {{of these}} {{printing}} methods were noisy, line printers of all designs were enclosed in <b>sound-absorbing</b> cases of varying sophistication.|$|E
50|$|In former {{years the}} dome's {{acoustics}} caused an echo problem, which repeated several times any short noise {{made in the}} room. Adding <b>sound-absorbing</b> material reduced this effect.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A typical CPAP machine {{houses the}} air pump {{in a case}} lined with <b>sound-absorbing</b> {{material}} for quieter operation. A hose carries the pressurized air to a face mask or nasal pillow.|$|E
5000|$|In nature, {{free field}} {{conditions}} {{can only be}} found if sound reflections on the floor do not matter, e.g. in new snow in a field or approximately at good <b>sound-absorbing</b> floors (deciduous, dry sand, etcetera.) ...|$|E
50|$|Buick also debuted the QuietTuning sound {{insulation}} on the Rainier. Buick's QuietTuning involved designing a vehicle with sound dampening features like triple door seals, acoustic laminate glass, and thicker <b>sound-absorbing</b> pads {{on the hood}} and firewall.|$|E
5000|$|The updated {{passenger}} cabin accommodates {{a maximum of}} 210 passengers or 174 in a typical two-class layout.The upgrades include new larger storage bins, multicolored LED lighting, <b>sound-absorbing</b> structures and a modern in-flight entertainment system (IFE) [...]|$|E
50|$|Some modern muffler {{designs are}} similar in {{principle}} to the glasspack, but use more sophisticated <b>sound-absorbing</b> materials such as stainless steel mesh, and more advanced acoustical engineering, reducing noise while retaining the power-preserving advantages of a straight-through exhaust flow.|$|E
5000|$|The Juliett {{class had}} a low {{magnetic}} signature austenitic steel double hull, covered by two inch (50 mm) thick black tiles made of <b>sound-absorbing</b> hard rubber. They had exceptionally high reserve buoyancy, and {{were divided into}} eight watertight compartments: ...|$|E
50|$|The AlloSphere {{includes}} a three-story cube {{that has been}} insulated extensively with <b>sound-absorbing</b> material, {{making it one of}} the largest echo-less chambers in the world. Within the chamber are two hemispheres of 5 meter radii, made of perforated aluminum. These are opaque and acoustically transparent.|$|E
5000|$|To {{mitigate}} the noise nuisance of the adjacent West Kowloon Corridor, the flats facing this motorway {{are equipped with}} [...] "acoustic balconies". The balcony parapet incorporates an inclined glass panel to deflect noise, and {{the walls and ceiling}} of the balconies are faced with <b>sound-absorbing</b> panels.|$|E
50|$|Later on, Grant added {{probably}} the first instant acoustic change, using rough sawn wooden slats which could cover or reveal <b>sound-absorbing</b> panels behind them and thus change the acoustics. This made the room suitable for the recording of both rock and orchestral music at the pull of a cord.|$|E
5000|$|A Jecklin Disk is a <b>sound-absorbing</b> disk placed {{between two}} {{microphones}} {{to create an}} acoustic [...] "shadow" [...] from one microphone to the other. The resulting two signals can possibly produce a pleasing stereo effect. A matching pair of small-diaphragm omnidirectional microphones is always used with a Jecklin disk.|$|E
50|$|In 1982 he {{represented}} Iceland at the Venice Biennale. 1993 {{he was one}} of three winners of the Prince Eugen Medal conferred by the King of Sweden. In 2010 he was the first Icelandic winner who got the Swedish Carnegie Art Award, worth SEK 1,000,000. He got it with his <b>sound-absorbing</b> pieces.|$|E
50|$|Many {{of these}} {{techniques}} rely upon materials science applications of constructing sound baffles or using <b>sound-absorbing</b> liners for interior spaces. Industrial noise control is really a subset of interior architectural control of noise, with emphasis upon specific methods of sound isolation from industrial machinery and for protection of workers at their task stations.|$|E
50|$|Noise {{control is}} an active or passive means of {{reducing}} sound emissions, often for personal comfort, environmental considerations or legal compliance. Active noise control is sound reduction using a power source. Passive noise control is sound reduction by noise-isolating materials such as insulation, <b>sound-absorbing</b> tiles, or a muffler rather than a power source.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of room treatment. <b>Sound-absorbing</b> {{materials}} may be placed strategically within a listening room to reduce the amplitude of early reflections, {{and to deal with}} resonance modes. Other treatments are designed to produce diffusion, reflection of sound in a scattered fashion. Room treatments can be expensive and difficult to optimize.|$|E
5000|$|Frequently, a wind-attenuating cover, {{called a}} [...] "blimp" [...] or [...] "mic-blimp", {{is used to}} enclose the {{microphone}}. A blimp covered with <b>sound-absorbing</b> fuzzy fabric is usually nicknamed a windmuff or a [...] "dead cat". In film crew jargon, the gruesome-sounding phrase dead cat on a stick is simply a boom microphone fitted with a fuzzy wind-screen.|$|E
50|$|Designed by Harry D. Payne {{using an}} art deco design style, Jeppesen Gymnasium's {{structure}} {{consisted of two}} stories and a basement. It was built of reinforced concrete and steel with masonry walls. Buttresses, columns, and steel trusses supported a <b>sound-absorbing</b> roof. On {{the south end of}} the structure were four entrances to a lobby that led to the basketball court itself.|$|E
50|$|The {{concert hall}} was {{designed}} in the traditional “shoebox” form of many international concert halls. Above the stage, a mechanized canopy of 43 individually controlled acrylic panels can be adjusted to fine-tune sound for clarity and reverberation. Tunable <b>sound-absorbing</b> curtains behind the bronze grilling and banners in the ceiling can be deployed out of sight to dampen or enliven the sound.|$|E
5000|$|The LX 450 was {{powered by}} a 4.5-liter, twin-cam, four-valve inline-six engine that {{produced}} [...] and 275 lbft Nm of torque. Both front and rear axles were solid. Externally, the LX 450 was identical to the J80 series Land Cruiser, {{with the exception of}} the grille, side body cladding, and wheels. Side running boards give step-up access. The vehicle had additional <b>sound-absorbing</b> insulation.|$|E
50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, a {{sound trap}} {{consists of an}} offset in the ductwork to reflect the sound back to its source. This configuration is often combined {{with the use of}} <b>sound-absorbing</b> material inside the trap. The physical dimensions of the sound trap may be selected to tune the trap to specific frequencies of sound. As such, it is then essentially a Helmholtz resonator used as a passive noise-control device.|$|E
50|$|Poelzig put a {{great deal}} of thought into the {{acoustics}} of the rooms. The chairs in the large broadcasting room were specially designed so that seats had the same <b>sound-absorbing</b> qualities whether they were occupied or not. In the smaller broadcasting room a hundred wall panels could be flipped. One side of the panels absorbed sound, the other reflected it. In this way very different reverberation effects could be created.|$|E
5000|$|The main organ {{was built}} in 2003 by the organ maker Kuhn AG of Männedorf, Switzerland. It stands above the main portal under the west rose window. The console is [...] "in" [...] the organ, {{centered}} over {{the back wall of}} the organ, facing towards the altar. It is electrically connected to a small tower organ chamber with four registers (cone chests), which is housed {{on the first floor of}} the large west tower. The organ chamber is swellable and has a <b>sound-absorbing</b> chamber.|$|E
50|$|Measured in the {{interior}}, {{the chapel}} is 249 ft long, 93.5 ft wide at its transepts, and 78.5 ft high at the crossing.

50|$|The primary room on {{the second}} floor is the Plavcan Gallery, located {{in the center of the}} north side, {{connecting}} with the upper part of the Main Hall. The Plavcan Gallery is a large room that contains a vaulted, coffered ceiling with laylights set in the coffers. On the south side of the second floor, two of the offices contain laylights in the ceilings. The basement contains the Children's Library spaces and numerous stack areas; most of the original finishes have been replaced with modern, <b>sound-absorbing,</b> light materials.|$|E
50|$|The 20 {{exhibition}} halls, {{with a total}} {{volume of}} about 2.5 million cubic metres, were demolished and submit to remediation in 2007 and 2008. Painstaking {{efforts were made to}} protect and recover the area’s stock of trees, 120 of which were saved and relocated in the public parks over Milan. Since 2007 a Permanent Environmental Observatory has worked to protect the surrounding districts. Administered by local public authorities, it controls the noise, dust and environmental impact during all stages of construction, using among other things, <b>sound-absorbing</b> and dust protective.|$|E
5000|$|Thus, Webb {{thought he}} could [...] "repeat it with my voice instead of with a pen". After much {{experimentation}} — first with a cigar box and then a tomato juice can — he arrived at a solution using a microphone inside a military aviator's rubber oxygen mask, paired with a coffee pot filled with <b>sound-absorbing</b> material. The result was eventually deemed by the United States Navy {{to be the most}} accurate method of transcription among [...] "all known systems of verbatim reporting", and was subsequently adopted for use in their court reporting.|$|E
50|$|The {{fourth floor}} {{contains}} three courtrooms {{that are very}} similar in appearance and retain many historic components. Covered with panasote, a type of artificial leather, doors feature bronze brads and kick plates. Walls are clad in <b>sound-absorbing</b> artificial stone that is an original material. Paired pilasters (attached columns) with Corinthian capitals dominate {{the wall behind the}} judge's bench. White marble with gold veins is used for door surrounds, baseboards, and on the steps to the judges' platforms. Original light fixtures descend from the ceilings. Tall, arched windows and large, rectangular skylights bordered in a geometric pattern also illuminate the courtrooms.|$|E

50|$|In 2011 Philips {{announced}} {{a partnership with}} Kvadrat Soft Cells to create a luminous textile which would combine Philips' experience in LED-based ambient lighting with Kvadrat Soft Cells' <b>sound-absorbing</b> textiles. The aim of the project is to enhance interior space through light and texture {{making full use of}} the broad spectrum of colours in Philips’ LED range. The textile is held in place with a lightweight aluminum frame that keeps it taut with the right amount of surface tension. The LED lights can be customised in a wide palette of colours that allow the final user to change the mood of the room whenever desired.|$|E
5000|$|... 5. 27 September 1938 - eleven {{hours of}} trip duration, {{on behalf of}} the Reich Air Ministry (RLM). At the airport and airship-port Rhein-Main a radio beacon was set up. The idea was to attempt a Funkbeschickung (a {{calibration}} of the direction-finding equipment). Hazy air hindered the attempts despite good weather conditions. The calibration did not succeed perfectly these problems arose even at later attempts. There were also first successes with the Ballastwassergewinnungsanlage (a water recovery system to save ballast). Three and a half tonnes of ballast water could be saved and the engines ran quieter because of the <b>sound-absorbing</b> effect of the device.|$|E
50|$|From October 1, 2010 to September 30, 2013, {{the arena}} {{was named after}} Stechert, the tubular {{furniture}} manufacturer. Since October 1, 2013, it has been called Brose ARENA, after automotive supplier Brose. In conjunction with the change of name, the town of Bamberg carried out major maintenance and building works, worth around 2.5 million euros. The acoustics inside the arena were improved by expanding the existing loud speaker system, and installing <b>sound-absorbing</b> wall cladding. Then the video technology was modernized, by purchasing a video cube with the latest LED technology, and updating the networks throughout the building. The new seating stands and modernization of the corporate zone, {{made a big difference}} to the appearance of Brose ARENA.|$|E
