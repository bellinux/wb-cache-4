25|$|When {{there is}} a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as {{something}} new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> are practicing the Dharma now. However, {{this is not the}} case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition.

25|$|To {{quell the}} riots, the Tsar {{looked to the}} army. At least 180,000 troops were {{available}} in the capital, but most were either untrained or injured. Historian Ian Beckett suggests around 12,000 could be regarded as reliable, but even these proved reluctant to move in on the crowd, since it included <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>women.</b> It was {{for this reason that}} when, on , the Tsar ordered the army to suppress the rioting by force, troops began to mutiny. Although few actively joined the rioting, many officers were either shot or went into hiding; the ability of the garrison to hold back the protests was all but nullified, symbols of the Tsarist regime were rapidly torn down around the city, and governmental authority in the capital collapsed – not helped by the fact that Nicholas had prorogued the Duma that morning, leaving it with no legal authority to act. The response of the Duma, urged on by the liberal bloc, was to establish a Temporary Committee to restore law and order; meanwhile, the socialist parties establish the Petrograd Soviet to represent workers and soldiers. The remaining loyal units switched allegiance the next day.|$|E

The choreography was done by Danielle Polanco and Jonte' Moaning, who used a 1980s retro set. Beyoncé explained the concept of the video at MTV: [...] "It's probably the most flamboyant video, and the metallic dresses are so beautiful, they added so much color. I had to do a video for this song. Everyone wanted to know what a 'freakum dress' was, and you can't really explain it, you have to see it.

She's feeling isolated and has fallen under Yusef's control. He wants revenge. She is totally in his power. I had to show this can happen to any woman, no matter how strong she seems. Zainab was strong and not naive, but a woman is vulnerable if the man hits the right psychological weak spots. But both Ace and I have {{found it hard to}} do.

While working on [...] "Flawless", Beyoncé was reminded of her loss on television competition Star Search as a child, which she saw as a defining moment in her career, and believed that the competition had {{taught her how to}} embrace imperfection in the future. The theme was represented in the videos by the recurring use of trophies, which the singer saw as referencing [...] "all of the sacrifice I have made as a kid, all of the time that I lost". It was also carried into how the visuals were created, with the videos for [...] "Drunk in Love", [...] "Yoncé", [...] "No Angel", [...] "XO" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] shot without prior preparation, as the singer found enjoyment in the spontaneity of the filming locations and in resisting the urge to perfect them. Noting some of the visuals' explicit content and exposure of her body, Beyoncé said she found shooting them liberating and expressed her intention to demonstrate sexuality as a power that women should have, and not lose after becoming a mother. She went on to say, [...] "I know finding my sensuality, getting back into my body, being proud of growing up, it was important to me that I expressed that...

Natalie Morales, {{best known for her}} role in the ABC Family science-fiction dramedy The Middleman, made her first Parks and Recreation appearance in the episode as Lucy, a Pawnee bartender and romantic interest for Tom. The scene between Lucy and Tom at the Snakehole Lounge was the same scene Natalie Morales read during her audition for the part, although the dialogue was rewritten slightly before filming. The line with Lucy asking Tom if he flirted with <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>women</b> because he was expected to have a [...] "43-way" [...] was added during the rewrite. Ralph Richeson, best known for playing the unkempt hotel employee Richardson in the HBO drama series Deadwood, briefly appeared as an unkempt man seeking a marriage license in the Pawnee town hall.

April Marie Eden, who played beauty contest winner Trish Ianetta in the episode [...] "Beauty Pageant", reprised that role in [...] "The Master Plan", in scenes where Tom flirted with her relentlessly at the Snakehole Lounge. Alison Becker, who played local reporter Shauna Malwae-Tweep in several past episodes, filmed several scenes where she and Andy flirt, but he ultimately rejects her due to his feelings for April. All of these scenes were cut from the final episode due to length restrictions, which Schur said he regretted because he found Becker very funny.|$|E

500|$|Despite this, member Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes was the opposite. She {{threatened}} to wear black tape {{over her mouth}} on the song's music video due to her disagreement with its message and the choice {{for it to be}} CrazySexyCool lead single, partially because of the group's history of advocating for safe sex since their debut. [...] "I was totally, 100% against 'Creep'. I wasn't down with cheating on your man, you know, for me, it's be faithful. Trust me, I fought against that single coming out. You know, I was like 'If a girl is gonna [...] catch her man cheating,' this was my thing, 'instead of telling her to cheat back, why don't we tell her [...] just leave,'" [...] she shared. In the end, Lopes eventually capitulated, stating: [...] "If some people can creep, and in their minds, they can feel better by going out doing the same thing... Fine. I'm just not one of those people." [...] She instead added her new rap verse on remixed versions of the song, which talks about the consequences of cheating. Thomas later thought the song and the video's choreography routine were [...] "cool" [...] enough to distract people from its lyrical content and [...] "just sing along."

Jon Parales of The New York Times stood by the song's concept, he wrote: [...] "The women sing about infidelity, revenge, status and power plays, not as victims but as contenders; when they're cheated on, they cheat, too."

Udell, writing in his journal, explained his concern: [...] "I thought it was preposterous to start on so long a journey with <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>woman</b> and helpless children, and <b>so</b> <b>many</b> dangers attending the attempt." [...] According to Baley, the emigrants first learned of the recently surveyed road while visiting Albuquerque.
