5|$|Fish are {{consumed}} fresh, {{or may be}} preserved by traditional methods, which include combinations of drying, smoking, and salting, or fermentation. Modern methods of preservation include freezing, freeze-drying, and heat processing (as in canning). Frozen fish products include breaded or battered fillets, fish fingers and fishcakes. Fish meal {{is used as a}} food supplement for farmed fish and for livestock. Fish oils are made either from fish liver, especially rich in vitamins A and D, or from the bodies of oily fish such as <b>sardine</b> and herring, and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies.|$|E

25|$|Food {{problems}} {{may be the}} cause of an observed failure of the birds to even try to breed. The results of the research suggest this is related to a decline in <b>sardines</b> (Sardinops sagax), {{an important part of the}} boobies’ diet. Earlier work on Española Island saw successful breeding in blue-footed boobies that have access to <b>sardines,</b> in which case their diet consists essentially wholly of <b>sardines.</b> However, <b>sardines</b> have been largely absent from the Española area since 1997, as has been shown from Nazca boobies there, who also prefer <b>sardines</b> but can breed using other prey. In 2012–13, roughly only half of prey items in the boobies' diet were <b>sardines.</b> No evidence was seen of other possible causes for the decline, such as effects of humans, introduced predators, or disease.|$|R
50|$|Fishing for sardela or sardina (Sardina pilchardus) on {{the coasts}} of Dalmatia and Istria began {{thousands}} of years ago. The region {{was part of the}} Roman Empire, then largely a Venetian dominion, and has always been sustained through fishing mainly <b>sardines.</b> All along the coast, many towns promote the age-old practice of fishing by lateen sail boats for tourism and on festival occasions. Today, industrial producers continue this tradition. Currently, the four factories of canned <b>sardines</b> are in Rovinj, Zadar, Postira, and Sali (the latter founded in 1905). Several famous dishes made with <b>sardines</b> include, for instance, komiška pogača (a pie with salted <b>sardines</b> and tomato sauce), saur or inšavor (<b>sardines</b> fried and then cooled, seasoned with olive oil, vinegar, garlic, black pepper and rosemary) and <b>sardines</b> roasted on stick from Sali, dugi otok.|$|R
5|$|Many {{fish are}} covered with highly {{reflective}} scales, giving the appearance of silvered mirror glass. Reflection through silvering is widespread or dominant in fish of the open sea, especially those {{that live in the}} top 100 metres. Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as <b>sardine</b> and herring are camouflaged by silvering.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} pie in {{the legend}} included sand eels, horse mackerel, pilchards, herring, dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish. In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the pilchard (<b>sardine),</b> although mackerel or herring {{is used as a}} substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white fish will work for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation. Prior to putting it in the pie the fish should be skinned and boned (except the head and tail) {{to make it easier to}} eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the <b>sardine</b> run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E

5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} cephalopods, bony fishes, and other {{cartilaginous}} fishes, the copper shark is a fast-swimming predator {{that has been}} known to hunt in large groups, utilizing their numbers to their advantage; however for {{most of the time they}} remain solitary. Off South Africa, this species associates closely with the annual <b>sardine</b> run, involving millions of southern African pilchard (Sardinops sagax). Like other requiem sharks, it is viviparous, with the developing embryos mainly nourished through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Females bear litters of 7 to 24 pups every other year in coastal nursery areas, after a gestation period of 12 or perhaps as long as 21 months. It is extremely slow-growing, with males and females not reaching maturity until 13–19 and 19–20 years of age respectively.|$|E
5|$|Some 97% of {{the common}} thresher's diet is {{composed}} of bony fishes, mostly small schooling forage fish such as mackerel, bluefish, herring, needlefish, and lanternfish. Before striking, the sharks compact schools of prey by swimming around them and splashing the water with its tail, often in pairs or small groups. Threshers are also known to take large, solitary fishes such as lancetfish, as well as squid and other pelagic invertebrates. Off California, common threshers feed mostly on the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), with Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), Pacific <b>sardine</b> (Sardinops sagax), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), market squid (Loligo opalescens), and pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) also being important food items. The sharks concentrate on a few prey species during cold water years, but become less discriminating during less productive, warmer El Niño periods.|$|E
5|$|Mangalorean cuisine {{is largely}} {{influenced}} by South Indian cuisine, with several cuisines being {{unique to the}} diverse communities of the region. Coconut and curry leaves are common ingredients to most Mangalorean curry, as are ginger, garlic and chili. Well-known Mangalorean dishes include Kori Rotti, Neer dosa, Pundi, Patrode, Mangalore Buns, Mangalore bajji, Macaroon etc. Mangalorean Cuisine is also known for Fish and chicken dishes like Bangude Pulimunchi (spicy sour silver-grey mackerels), Boothai Gasi (<b>Sardine</b> Semi-Gravy), Anjal fry, Mangalorean Chicken Sukka, Kori rotti, Chicken Ghee Roast etc. Since Mangalore is a coastal city, fish forms the staple diet of most people. The Konkani Hindu community's specialties include Daali thoy, Bibbe-upkari (cashew based), Val val, Avnas ambe sasam, Kadgi chakko, Paagila podi, and Chane gashi. Mangalorean Catholics' Sanna-Dukra Maas (Sanna—idli fluffed with toddy or yeast; Dukra Maas—Pork), Pork Bafat, Sorpotel and the Mutton Biryani of the Beary Muslims are well-known dishes. Pickles such as Happala, Sandige and Puli munchi are unique to Mangalore. Shendi (toddy), a country liquor prepared from coconut flower sap, is popular. Vegetarian cuisine in Mangalore, also known as Udupi cuisine, is known throughout the state and region.|$|E

5|$|US-89 {{meets the}} current {{alignment}} of US-91 {{in the southern}} outskirts of Brigham City, turning east for an overlap on the city's southeast bypass. (SR-13 and SR-90 are the former alignment through Brigham City.) The two routes head east up Box Elder Canyon in the southern Wellsville Mountains, finally leaving {{the valley of the}} Great Salt Lake into a small valley that contains Mantua Reservoir (elevation 5200 feet/1585 m). US-89/US-91 turns north there, bypassing the town of Mantua to the west, and continues to ascend through Dry Canyon to <b>Sardine</b> Summit (elevation 5900 feet/1798 m). Another small valley leads to Wellsville Canyon, where the four-lane roadway again turns east and descends into the Cache Valley. In that valley, US-89/US-91 heads northeast, bypassing Wellsville to the east, into downtown Logan. US-91 continues northerly from Logan into Idaho, but US-89 splits to the east, beginning a long climb of the Bear River Range through Logan Canyon. The Logan Canyon Scenic Byway, a Utah and National Scenic Byway, begins at Logan and follows US-89 up the canyon, past the access road to the Beaver Mountain ski area, to Garden City and on to the state line. Bear Lake Summit (elevation 7800ft/2377 m), {{at the top of the}} range, is the highest point on US-89 in Utah, from which it descends the east slope via horseshoe curves to Garden City on the shore of Bear Lake (elevation 5900ft/1798 m).

40|$|Vitamin D is a fat-soluble hormone {{primarily}} responsible in maintaining plasma calcium and phosphorus homeostasis in humans. Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency {{is a global}} health issue. Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D; a major source is oily fish such as salmon. Several studies have analyzed vitamin D content in various fish, however studies concerning canned fish are lacking. In particular, this study was interested in evaluating the vitamin D content in canned <b>sardines</b> in not only the whole fish {{but also in the}} olive oil or water it was canned in. It was hypothesized that the vitamin D content in <b>sardines</b> canned in water would be greater than <b>sardines</b> canned in olive oil due to the fat-soluble nature of vitamin D to be more easily extracted into olive oil than water. <b>Sardines</b> (~ 100 g) canned in olive oil had a slightly greater vitamin D content than the <b>sardines</b> in water (2, 555. 6 ± 234. 2 and 1, 993. 7 ± 2, 411. 3 IUs (p< 0. 05) respectively). An evaluation of the vitamin D 3 content in the olive oil and water used to can the <b>sardines</b> revealed 701. 4 ± 471. 1 and 149. 1 ± 42. 2 IUs in the total olive oil and water respectively recovered from the cans. It was determined that of the total vitamin D content in the can (<b>sardines</b> in olive oil or water) 20. 9 %± 12. 8 % of vitamin D 3 is found in the olive oil compared to only 14. 2 %± 10. 4 % (p< 0. 05) vitamin D 3 found in water. These results support the concept that <b>sardines</b> packed in olive oil may have less vitamin D 3 than similar <b>sardines</b> packed in water. The analysis of the <b>sardines</b> revealed that they had more than 13 times the amount of vitamin D 3 than that is reported in the USDA table of nutritional facts for canned <b>sardines.</b> This could be because the <b>sardines</b> were caught in the summer months when {{they are more likely to}} be consuming food containing vitamin D 3 as a result of reduced synthesis of vitamin D 3 in zooplankton and other lower life forms that the <b>sardines</b> consume. An alternative explanation for this increase in vitamin D 3 content is the process of canning the <b>sardines.</b> Vital Choice, the supplier of the <b>sardines,</b> immediately ices the fish upon retrieval from the ocean (to ensure freshness) and then are canned in less than 5 hours after being caught. This process of freshness preservation could explain why the vitamin D content was so high; possibly an accurate representation of the original vitamin D content in the <b>sardines...</b>|$|R

25|$|Most years, off {{southern}} Africa between May and July, {{billions of}} sardines (specifically the Southern African pilchard Sardinops sagax) spawn {{in the cool}} waters of the Agulhas Bank and move northward along {{the east coast of}} South Africa. This great fish migration is called the <b>sardine</b> run. Their sheer numbers create a feeding frenzy along the coastline. The run, containing millions of individual sardines, occurs when a current of cold water heads north from the Agulhas Bank up to Mozambique where it then leaves the coastline and goes further east into the Indian Ocean. During the <b>sardine</b> run, as many as 18,000 dolphins, behaving like sheepdogs, herd the sardines into bait balls, or corral them in shallow water. Once rounded up, the dolphins and other predators take turns ploughing through the bait balls, gorging on the fish as they sweep through. Seabirds also attack them from above, flocks of gannets, cormorants, terns and gulls. The <b>sardine</b> run is featured in the first episode of the 2001 BBC nature documentary The Blue Planet and in the 2008 3D IMAX documentary film Wild Ocean.|$|E
