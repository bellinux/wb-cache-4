5|$|In 1907, Bauer {{was asked}} by the Åhlén & Åkerlund {{publishing}} house (now Bonnier Group) to illustrate their new series of books, Among Gnomes and Trolls. The books would be published annually, and contain stories by prominent Swedish authors. The majority of Bauer's pictures for the book were full-page watercolor illustrations in a muted color scheme; he also contributed with covers, vignettes and other smaller illustrations. Bauer's most significant creatures, the trolls, were rendered in <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray,</b> green, and brown, the colors of the forests, as if these beings had grown from the landscape itself. Due to the limitiations of the technology available to his printers, the 1907–10 editions were produced in just two colors: black and yellow. Some of Bauer's original paintings for these prints were in full color.|$|E
25|$|The first motion {{pictures}} were photographed using a simple homogeneous photographic emulsion that yielded a black-and-white image—that is, an image in <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray,</b> ranging from black to white, {{corresponding to the}} luminous intensity of each point on the photographed subject. Light, shade, form and movement were captured, but not color.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Navy {{established}} an Admiralty camouflage section in October 1940. Initial Admiralty disruptive camouflage schemes employed polygons of multiple <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray,</b> {{blue and green}} so {{at least two of}} the colors would blend with background sea or sky under different light conditions. Experience showed the polygons were too small to be differentiated at effective camouflage ranges. Simplified Admiralty light and dark disruptive schemes were promulgated in 1942 to use larger and simpler polygons with no more than four colors.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, the Capitol Steps had 26 {{cast members}} and five pianists. The group {{performs}} {{public and private}} shows throughout the country, and appears at the Ronald Reagan International Trade Center in Washington, D.C. every Friday and Saturday year-round. Their show is frequently updated; they released several albums during the Obama administration, including Mock the Vote, How to Succeed in Congress without Really Lying, Fiscal <b>Shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gray,</b> Take the Money and Run for President, Desperate Housemembers, Liberal Shop of Horrors, and Obama Mia.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, {{during the}} Great Depression, {{the state of}} Virginia helped the Pamunkey develop their pottery {{as a source of}} income. The state set up a program for a pottery school and {{provided}} a teacher. The state furnished materials for the building, but the tribe built it themselves. Tribal members learned methods to increase the speed of manufacture. They incorporated firing pottery in a kiln and using glazes into their techniques. They learned to use squeeze molds to produce copies of pots quickly. Kiln firing produced finished pottery of more uniform brown tones than the <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> from traditional pottery techniques.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} of GOES-12 satellite images shows {{the distribution of}} atmospheric water vapor relative to the oceans, clouds and continents of the Earth. Vapor surrounds the planet but is unevenly distributed. The image loop on the right shows monthly average of water vapor content with the units are given in centimeters, which is the precipitable water or equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense. The lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in yellow, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue. Areas of missing data appear in <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray.</b> The maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite. The most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor. In the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles {{north and south of}} the equator as the seasons change. This band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds. Farther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter. Another pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do. This is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean. Water vapor condenses more rapidly in colder air.|$|E

50|$|The sparrow {{has a long}} tail, gray-brown {{with white}} corners, and has dark marks {{on the back and}} sides. The species resembles Botteri's sparrow because of its size and marks, but Boterri's sparrow is a weaker <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray.</b> The best way to tell the {{differences}} between the two is the song of Cassin's sparrow. Both the males and females are the same <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> and are 5 to 6 inches, although males are bigger.|$|R

He was entertaining, and he and I actually worked on my lecture that I give in [...]" [...] About his character Sarsgaard remarked, [...] "He's got <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray.</b> It's eccentricity on top of eccentricity".|$|E
500|$|The {{color of}} fullblood Piedmontese males is gray-white with a {{considerable}} amount of black hairs on the head, most notable around the eyes, neck, shoulders, and on the distal regions of the legs. [...] They occasionally have dark stains or spots on their hind legs or lateral faces of the trunk. [...] The cows are primarily white with varying <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> or light red. [...] Calves are born a pale fawn color which changes to gray-white as they mature. [...] Fullbloods are naturally horned, and have black pigmentation on the muzzle, eyelids, ears, tongue, tassel of the tail, anal opening, and on the outer skin of the sexual organs.|$|E
500|$|The first YF-23 (serial number 87-0800), Prototype Air Vehicle 1 (PAV-1), was {{rolled out}} on 22 June 1990; PAV-1 took its 50-minute maiden flight on 27 August with Alfred [...] "Paul" [...] Metz at the controls. The second YF-23 (serial number 87-0801, PAV-2) {{made its first}} flight on 26 October, piloted by Jim Sandberg. The first YF-23 was painted {{charcoal}} gray and was nicknamed [...] "Black Widow II", after the Northrop P-61 Black Widow of World War II. It briefly had a red hourglass marking resembling the marking {{on the underside of}} the black widow spider before Northrop management had it removed. The second prototype was painted in two <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> and nicknamed [...] "Spider". and [...] "Gray Ghost".|$|E

500|$|Dr. Meredith Grey is the {{daughter}} of world-renowned surgeon Ellis Grey, and grew up in her shadow. Ellis was a deeply flawed, emotionally and verbally abusive, neglectful mother towards her. Meredith is described as a [...] "dark and twisty," [...] damaged person who sees the world in varying <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> morality. Because of this, she is an emotionally complex person capable of empathizing with others when they're at their lowest points, and a sensitive observer of the people around her. Meredith is a graduate of Dartmouth College and nearly did not attend med school due to conflicts with her mother. Meredith was directionless after obtaining her undergrad and had plans to sleep and party her way through Europe. After a month abroad, Meredith was called back to care for Ellis, who had developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and Meredith obtained her M.D.|$|E
500|$|Initial Admiralty {{disruptive}} camouflage schemes employed polygons {{of varying}} <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray,</b> {{blue and green}} so {{at least two of}} the colors would blend with background sea or sky under different light conditions. Schemes devised for capital ships emphasized identity confusion rather than concealment. [...] became the first ship to receive an official camouflage scheme in January 1941. As more ships received similar schemes through 1941 it became evident the polygons were too small to be differentiated at effective camouflage ranges. Simplified Admiralty light and dark disruptive schemes were promulgated in 1942 to use larger and simpler polygons with no more than four colors. Light disruptive schemes were intended for use in the higher latitudes where skies were often overcast. Dark disruptive schemes used darker colors providing more effective disruption where bright sunlight could be expected.|$|E
500|$|Walter Joseph Kovacs / Rorschach: A vigilante {{who wears}} a white mask that {{contains}} a symmetrical but constantly shifting ink blot pattern, he continues to fight crime {{in spite of his}} outlaw status. Moore said he was trying to [...] "come up with this quintessential Steve Ditko character—someone who's got a funny name, whose surname begins with a 'K,' who's got an oddly designed mask". Moore based Rorschach on Ditko's creation Mr. A; Ditko's Charlton character The Question also served as a template for creating Rorschach. Comics historian Bradford W. Wright described the character's world view [...] "a set of black-and-white values that take many shapes but never mix into <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray,</b> similar to the ink blot tests of his namesake". Rorschach sees existence as random and, according to Wright, this viewpoint leaves the character [...] "free to 'scrawl [...] own design' on a 'morally blank world. Moore said he did not foresee the death of Rorschach until the fourth issue when he realized that his refusal to compromise would result in him not surviving the story.|$|E

Written {{as a concept}} album, A Pleasant <b>Shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gray</b> revealed a much darker and bleaker mood in songwriting style than had been heard before from the band. The album consists of a single 53-minute song split into twelve parts, making it the longest track Fates Warning has ever recorded.|$|R
500|$|GamePro {{considered}} the gun [...] "well-designed" [...] and [...] "fairly good-looking", though they {{wrote that the}} gun's options buttons were inconvenient and that the Menacer's lengthy recalibrations before play sessions without Accu-Sight were tedious. Mean Machines wrote that the gun's <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> clashed with the glossy black console. Several reviewers called the binocular scope addition unhelpful. Paul Mellerick of Mega found the manual sights an eyestrain and the gun [...] "deadly accurate" [...] as long as players used the Accu-Sight mode. Still, as of January 1993, Mega felt that the Menacer's future success was doubtless. Jaz of Mean Machines had low expectations for the Menacer, which he compared to the shortcomings of previous light guns: high price, short-lived novelty, and dearth of games. Gus of Mean Machines wrote that [...] "Sega hasn't learned the lessons" [...] from the Super Scope's [...] "fairly naff" [...] release in the magazine's January 1993 Menacer review, calling the light gun a [...] "samey-looking, samey-playing piece of hardware, with some redundant add-ons" [...] with mediocre launch titles. He added that the Menacer was less tiring to use than the Super Scope, praised the Menacer's infrared, and criticized the gun's lack of available software.|$|E
500|$|The main CPU of the WonderSwan is a 16-bit NEC V30 MZ. [...] The {{original}} model's {{screen is}} capable of displaying up to eight <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray,</b> {{in contrast to the}} four displayed by the WonderSwan's main competitor, the Game Boy. [...] Similar to the Atari Lynx, the handheld has an extra set of buttons allowing the console to be played at different angles; for the WonderSwan, these buttons were used to allow gamers to play games in both the portrait and landscape orientations. [...] The WonderSwan series are all powered by a single AA battery, with the original monochrome version having a battery life of 40 hours. Also included in the handheld was built-in memory allowing players to save their game. It also allows players to record their personal information, such as their name, birth date, and blood type, which then can be accessed and used by the game. Its LCD screen is [...] and displays at a resolution of 224 × 144. Its sound capabilities consist of four PCM channels, each of which can play 32-sample, 4-bit sounds at selectable volume and pitch levels.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety said Jolie {{was more}} {{affecting}} than in A Mighty Heart(2007) because she relied less on artifice. He also noted {{a surfeit of}} good supporting performances, Michael Kelly's in particular. Oliver Séguret of Libération said the cast was the film's best feature. He praised the supporting actors and said Jolie's performance was forceful yet understated. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter said Jolie shunned her [...] "movie star" [...] persona to appear vulnerable and resolute. He perceived the supporting characters—Amy Ryan's excepted—as having few <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray.</b> David Ansen, writing in Newsweek, echoed the sentiment, but said that [...] "some stories really are about the good guys and the bad". He said that with the distractions of Jolie's celebrity and beauty put aside, she carried the role with restraint and intensity. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt that Jolie's celebrity was distracting enough to render her unconvincing, and David Denby of The New Yorker said that while Jolie showed skill and selflessness, the performance and character were uninteresting. He said Collins was one-dimensional, lacking desires or temperament. He cited similar problems with Malkovich's Briegleb, concluding, [...] "The two of them make a very proper and dull pair of collaborators." ...|$|E
