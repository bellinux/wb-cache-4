40|$|ObjectiveHigh-mobility-group box protein 1 (HMGB 1), as a late {{mediator}} of inflammation, plays a {{key role}} in inflammatory responses by inducing and extending the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The effect of HGMB 1 in the inflammatory disease thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is unknown. We aimed to investigate the role of HMGB 1 in sodium laurate-induced TAO in rats. MethodsMale Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 8 each) for treatment: normal, sham-operated, TAO model, and low-dose (15 mg/kg) or high-dose (30 mg/kg) recombinant A box (rA box) infection (administered intraperitoneally once daily for 15 days). The TAO model was induced by <b>sodium</b> <b>laurate</b> and graded by gross appearance on day 15 after femoral artery injection. Histologic changes were measured by histopathology in rat femoral arteries. Plasma levels of HMGB 1, thromboxane B 2, 6 -keto-prostaglandin F 1 -α, and blood cell counts and blood coagulation levels were measured. Expression of HMGB 1, receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), interleukin- 6, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 was assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, Western blot analysis, and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. ResultsThe typical signs and symptoms of TAO were observed on day 15 after <b>sodium</b> <b>laurate</b> injection. The expression of HMGB 1, RAGE, interleukin- 6, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 was markedly increased in rat femoral arteries. Plasma levels of HMGB 1 and thromboxane B 2 were elevated, but the level of 6 -keto-prostaglandin F 1 -α was decreased. Blood was in a hypercoagulable state, and prothrombin, thrombin, and activated partial thromboplastin times were all significantly shortened, whereas fibrinogen level was increased in TAO rats compared with sham-operated rats. These effects were terminated by the HMGB 1 antagonist rA box. ConclusionsHMGB 1 is involved in the inflammatory state in a model of TAO induced by <b>sodium</b> <b>laurate</b> in rats, probably via its receptor RAGE. As the antagonist of HMGB 1, rA box can attenuate the development of TAO, which may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of TAO. Clinical RelevanceThromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), or Buerger disease, is a segmental nonatherosclerotic inflammatory disorder. Patients with Buerger disease have a lower quality of life because of intermittent claudication, rest pain, ulcers, and superficial thrombophlebitis. The specific etiology and pathologic mechanisms remain not elucidated. High-mobility-group box protein 1, as a late mediator of inflammation, {{plays a key}} role in inflammatory responses to tissue injury and infection by inducing and extending the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Here, we explored the role of high-mobility-group box protein 1 in rat model of TAO, discovering a new damage marker in TAO.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effect of various {{detergents}} on keratinocyte gene expression in vitro, using an anionic detergent (sodium dodecyl sulfate), a cationic detergent cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide (CTAB), and two nonionic detergents, Nonidet P- 40 and Tween- 20. We measured {{the effect of these}} detergents on direct cellular toxicity (lactate dehydrogenase release), on the expression of markers for normal differentiation (cytokeratin 1 and involucrin expression), and on disturbed keratinocyte differentiation (SKALP) by nothern blot analysis. As reported in other studies, large differences were noted in direct cellular toxicity. In a culture model that mimics normal epidermal differentiation we found that low concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate could induce the expression of SKALP, a proteinase inhibitor that is not normally expressed in human epidermis but is found in hyperproliferative skin. Sodium dodecyl sulfate caused upregulation of involucrin and downregulation of cytokeratin 1 expression, which is associated with the hyperproliferative/inflammatory epidermal phenotype found in psoriasis, wound healing, and skin irritation. These changes were not induced after treatment of cultures with CTAB, Triton X- 100, and Nonidet-P 40. This effect appeared to be specific for the class of anionic detergents because sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate and <b>sodium</b> <b>laurate</b> also induced SKALP expression. These in vitro findings showed only a partial correlation with the potential of different detergents to induce clinical, biophysical, and cell biologic changes in vivo in human skin. Both sodium dodecyl sulfate and CTAB were found to cause induction and upregulation of SKALP and involucrin at low doses following a 24 h patch test, whereas high concentrations of Triton X- 100 did not. Sodium dodecyl sulfate induced higher rates of transepidermal water loss, whereas CTAB treated skin showed more signs of cellular toxicity. We conclude that the action of anionic detergents on epidermal keratinocytes is qualitatively different from the other detergents tested, which might have implications for in vitro toxicology studies that use cell biologic parameters as a read-out. We would hypothesize that detergents cause skin injury by several mechanisms that include direct cellular toxicity, disruption of barrier function, and detergent specific effects on cellular differentiation, as demonstrated here for sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, and <b>sodium</b> <b>laurate...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{we found that}} anionic surfactants such as <b>sodium</b> <b>laurate</b> (SL) and/or sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) exert actions on epidermal keratinocytes rather than mast cells to give rise of histamine production and skin itching through increasing {{the expression of the}} 53 -kDa active form of l-histidine decarboxylase (HDC). In addition, with treatment of SL in a three-dimensional human keratinocyte culture, increases in both the 53 -kDa HDC and histamine production are detected and thus this culture assay is applied to screen anti-itching materials from natural resources. In this study, the inhibitory activity of “Kin-gin-ka” (flower buds of Lonicera japonica Thunb., FLJ) against histamine production and expression of the active form of HDC were examined in this culture assay. FLJ is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, being used to treat fevers, coughs and some infectious diseases. The result showed both FLJ and chlorogenic acid had inhibitory activities against the expression of 53 -kDa HDC and histamine production. However, chlorogenic acid showed a weaker effect on histamine production than that of FLJ, suggesting that other chemical constituents besides chlorogenic acid could contribute to the inhibitory activities.

Experimental critical supersaturations increased systematically with increasing carbon chain length and were in the range 0. 96 - 1. 34 % for particles with a dry diameter of 40 nm. The experimental data were modeled using Köhler theory modified to account for partitioning of the surface active fatty acid sodium salts between the droplet bulk and surface as well as Köhler theory including surface tension reduction without accounting for surfactant partitioning.

40|$|Thermal {{aggregation}} and gelation of oat globulin {{were studied}} by FT-NIR Raman spectroscopy. The buffer-soluble aggregates exhibited a Raman spectrum {{similar to that}} of the unheated control, whereas the insoluble aggregates showed intensity increases in the tryptophan, C–H bending and C–H stretching bands, and a decrease in the tyrosine doublet (I 850 /I 830), suggesting protein denaturation. However, analysis of the amide I region using Raman Spectral Analysis Package (RASP) program revealed marked decreases in α-helical and increases in β-sheet structure in both soluble and insoluble aggregates. Similar conformational changes were also observed in the heat-induced oat globulin gels, and may be attributed to realignment of molecular segments and formation of intermolecular β-sheet structures. Thermal gelation under the influence of different chaotropic salts showed some shifts in band positions and changes in band intensity, following the lyotropic series of anions. Several protein structure perturbants, including sodium dodecyl sulfate, dithiothreitol, urea and <b>sodium</b> <b>laurate,</b> were found to affect the Raman spectral characteristics of oat globulin gels.

It was concluded, therefore, that both the length of the carbon chain and the presence of the carboxyl group of the free fatty acids were important in their effects on P. pestis. Neither the very active lauric acid nor the relatively inactive oleic acid appeared to severely alter the morphology of P. pestis.

40|$|The {{hydrophobic}} {{nature of}} most membrane proteins severely complicates their extraction, proteolysis and identification. Although detergents {{can be used}} to enhance the solubility of the membrane proteins, it is often difficult for a detergent not only to have a strong ability to extract membrane proteins, but also to be compatible with the subsequent proteolysis and mass spectrometric analysis. In this study, we made evaluation on a novel application of <b>sodium</b> <b>laurate</b> (SL) to the shotgun analysis of membrane proteomes. SL was found not only to lyse the membranes and solubilize membrane proteins as efficiently as SDS, but also to be well compatible with trypsin and chymotrypsin. Furthermore, SL could be efficiently removed by phase transfer method from samples after acidification, thus ensuring not to interfere with the subsequent CapLC-MS/MS analysis of the proteolytic peptides of proteins. When SL was applied to assist the digestion and identification of a standard protein mixture containing bacteriorhodoposin and the proteins in rat liver plasma membrane-enriched fractions, it was found that, compared with other two representative enzyme- and MS-compatible detergents RapiGest SF (RGS) and sodium deoxycholate (SDC), SL exhibited obvious superiority in the identification of membrane protein...|$|E

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Sea spray {{particles}} ejected as {{a result}} of bubbles bursting from artificial seawater containing salt and organic matter in a stainless steel tank were sampled for size distribution, morphology, and cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) activity. Bubbles were generated either by aeration through a diffuser or by water jet impingement on the seawater surface. Three objectives were addressed in this study. First, CCN activities of NaCl and two types of artificial sea salt containing only inorganic components were measured to establish a baseline for further measurements of mixed organic−inorganic particles. Second, the effect of varying bubble residence time in the bulk seawater solution on particle size and CCN activity was investigated and was found to be insignificant for the organic compounds studied. Finally, CCN activities of particles produced from jet impingement were compared with those produced from diffuser aeration. Analyses indicate a considerable amount of organic enrichment in the jet-produced particles relative to the bulk seawater composition when <b>sodium</b> <b>laurate,</b> an organic surfactant, is present in the seawater. In this case, the production of a thick foam layer during impingement may explain the difference in activation and supports hypotheses that particle production from the two methods of generating bubbles is not equal. 1...|$|E

The antibacterial TC has been studied as a model active ingredient in surfactant systems and on its own to contribute to the understanding of the lifecycle of active ingredients when used in soap formulations. The effect of TC in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and <b>sodium</b> <b>laurate</b> (SL) systems has been investigated using a range of physical chemistry techniques including UV-Vis and NMR to determine the increased solubility of TC in surfactant micelles. The effect of TC on the size and shape of SDS micelles has been examined using small angle neutron scattering. The surface tension of TC/ surfactant mixtures was studied to find the effects of TC on the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the surfactant solutions: TC decreases the CMC of SDS and the effect is pH dependant. The partitioning of the poorly water soluble TC is dependent on pH as well as the concentration of surfactant. It is important to understand the partitioning in these soap system to understand factors such as bioavailability and deposition.

The surfactants used were sodium stearate, sodium palmitate, sodium myristate and <b>sodium</b> <b>laurate.</b> The drops were suspended on fine glass fibres or thermocouples in an environmental cell maintained at known temperature and humidity, and the evaporation rate {{was determined by}} optical measurement of the change of diameter with time. The results showed an early evaporation following a "clean" model, with a relatively sharp transition to a regime of "contaminated" evaporation kinetics. Simultaneous measurements of temperature and evaporation rate showed that the contaminants {{had no effect on}} heat transfer, i. e. their effect was limited to forming an additional mass transfer resistance. This mass transfer resistance increased strongly with initial surfactant concentration. Surfactants with longer carbon chains produced higher resistances, but after a longer delay. The partial differential equations describing surfactant diffusion within an evaporating drop were set up and solved, and an approximate analytical solution was shown to agree well with a numerical solution. By assuming that the surfactants retarded evaporation at the drop surface both by presenting a diffusional resistance to water transport and by vapour pressure lowering, a model was constructed to predict the evaporation behaviour of contaminated drops. It predicted the results obtained with sodium stearate well, but was unable to explain the results for shorter chain surfactants which were complicated by their adsorption behaviour at the surfactant-water interface. This model of single drop evaporation was extended to describe the evaporation of contaminated aerosols and used in an attempt to explain the measurements of Raper et al. (1982). Their results could not be explained quantitatively by a surfactant contaminant (though a surfactant would have produced similar qualitative features) and were probably caused by experimental error...|$|E
40|$|Several {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} advanced to ex-plain the hyperlipemia {{characteristic of the}} ne-phrotic syndrome. The work of Rosenman, Fried-man and Byers (1) indicated that the liver fails to remove lipids from the circulation at a normal rate. It was suggested that a loss of lipoprotein lipase into the urine, together with a deficiency of albumin which is necessary for transport of unes-terified fatty acids, leads to impaired lipid clearing, and accumulation of lipid in the serum (2). Hey-mann and colleagues (3), however, measured the rate of disappearance of labeled <b>sodium</b> <b>laurate</b> from the circulation and observed no difference between normal and nephrotic animals. Marsh and Drabkin (4) presented evidence that in se-vere experimental nephrotic syndrome there is a redistribution of lipid within the body and an as-sociated mobilization lipemia, while in milder de-grees of disease hyperlipemia {{is the result of}} in-creased hepatic lipogenesis (5). We have attempted to determine the source of the excess lipid in the serum by labeling body fats with C 1 ' before the injection of nephrotoxic serum and following the changes in the radioactivity of body fat compartments during the development of hyperlipemia. In addition, the rates of removal from serum of chylomicron lipid and of albumin-bound fatty acid were measured in established nephrosis. METHODS Production of nephrosis. Nephrosis was induced in rats by injection of rabbit antirat kidney serum prepared by the method of Heymann and Lund (6). The same lot of serum was used for all animals in each experiment. The dose was 0. 4 ml. per Gm. of kidney (6), and was given in two equal injections 20 hours apart (animals sacrificed before 20 hours received only one injection of serum). Isolation and measurement of total fatty acids and cholesterol. Liver and carcass were digested by refluxin...|$|E
40|$|Although proof-of-principle for non-viral gene {{transfer}} to the airways of cystic fibrosis patients has been established the efficiency is comparatively low. Two strategies related to further improving {{gene transfer}} were studied in this PhD. First, bacteria-mediated gene transfer (bactofection) and second, the ability of tight junction openers to enhance liposome-mediated gene transfer to murine lung in vivo were assessed. A genetically engineered E. coli strain {{was used to assess}} bactofection. Successful in vitro bactofection was demonstrated. In vivo data indicated that E. coli-mediated lung bactofection does not lead to easily detectable eukaryotic gene expression, and is less efficient than well established GL 67 -mediated gene transfer. A narrow toxicity/efficacy window was identified and, furthermore, reporter gene expression in the bacterial host complicated interpretation of the data. The ability of ethyleneglycol-bis-(β-aminoethyl ether) -N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), sodium caprate (C 10) and <b>sodium</b> <b>laurate</b> (C 12) to enhance GL 67 -mediated gene transfer in vivo by modulating tight junctional permeability was assessed. EGTA had no effect. Pre-treatment with C 10, C 12 and LPC significantly enhanced gene transfer to murine lung and nose after careful optimisation of drug doses and delivery. C 10 proved most efficient and potential difference measurements indicated that C 10 altered tight junction permeability in the murine nasal epithelium. However, pre-treatment with C 10 did not allow correction of the ion transport defect in CF mice or enhance CFTR mRNA expressions levels. A higher concentration of C 10 was also assessed in the murine nose; tissue damage was observed, indicating a narrow efficacy/toxicity window. Finally, in a human airway ex vivo model, C 10 pre-treatment resulted in a significant decrease in transepithelial resistance indicating an opening of tight junctions, but no enhancement of GL 67 -mediated gene transfer was observed. In conclusion, bactofection does not provide any advantages over lipid-mediated gene transfer. Lipid-mediated gene transfer can be enhanced through administration of tight junction openers and, therefore, may warrant further assessment in large animal models.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the permeability characteristics of rebamipide across intestinal mucosa, {{and examine the}} effects of some absorption enhancers on the permeability across the colonic tissue. Another purpose is to demonstrate the colon-specific delivery of rebamipide with or without absorption enhancers using chitosan capsule as a carrier. METHODS: The permeability of rebamipide was evaluated using an in vitro diffusion chamber system, and the effects of some absorption enhancers on the permeability via colon were further investigated. The release of rebamipide from chitosan or gelatin capsule was studied by Japan Pharmacopoeia rotating basket method. The colonic and plasma concentrations were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to evaluate colon-targeting action after oral administration of various dosage forms, and rebamipide with absorption enhancers in chitosan dosage forms. RESULTS: The permeability of rebamipide across the jejunal or ileal membranes was higher than the colonic membranes. Both <b>sodium</b> <b>laurate</b> (C 12) and labrasol significantly increased permeability across the colon membranes. On the other hand, the release of rebamipide from chitosan capsule was less than 10 % totally within 6 h. The area under concentration-time profile of drug in the colon mucosa using chitosan capsules (AUCLI, 1   6011. 2 ng·h/g) was 2. 5 times and 4. 4 times greater than using gelatin capsules and CMC suspension, respectively. Meanwhile, the area under concentration-time profile of drug in the plasma (AUCPL) was 1016. 0 ng·h/mL for chitosan capsule, 1887. 9 ng·h/mL for CMC suspension p and 2163. 5 ng·h/mL for gelatin capsule. Overall, both AUCLI and AUCPL were increased when C 12 was co-administrated, but the increase of AUCLI was much greater; the drug delivery index (DDI) was more than 1 compared with simple chitosan capsule group. CONCLUSION: There was a regional difference in the permeability of Rebamipide across the jejunum, ileum and the colon, and passive diffusion seems {{to be one of the}} major transport mechanisms of rebamipide. Absorption enhancers can increase the permeability of rebamipide across the colon tissue significantly. In addition, chitosan capsule may be a useful carrier to deliver rebamipide to the colon specifically and the co-administration of C 12 with rebamipide may also be very useful in local treatment...|$|E
