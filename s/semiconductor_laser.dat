25|$|A CD is read by {{focusing}} a 780nm wavelength (near infrared) <b>semiconductor</b> <b>laser</b> housed within the CD player, through {{the bottom of}} the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the intensity change with a photodiode, the data can be read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>laser</b> is placed on a swing arm within the disc tray of any CD player.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} features of any VECSEL is the small thickness of the semiconductor gain region in the direction of propagation, less than 100nm. In contrast, a conventional in-plane <b>semiconductor</b> <b>laser</b> entails light propagation over distances of from 250Âµm upward to 2mm or longer. The significance of the short propagation distance is that it causes the effect of [...] "antiguiding" [...] nonlinearities in the diode laser gain region to be minimized. The result is a large-cross-section single-mode optical beam which is not attainable from in-plane ("edge-emitting") diode lasers.|$|E
40|$|We analyse the {{sensitivity}} of quantum dot <b>semiconductor</b> <b>lasers</b> to optical feedback. While bulk and quantum well <b>semiconductor</b> <b>lasers</b> are usually extremely unstable when submitted to back reflection, quantum dot <b>semiconductor</b> <b>lasers</b> exhibit a reduced sensitivity.

KGaA, Weinheim 1 Introduction The performance of quantum dot devices is presently the subject of great interest [1]. In particular, several studies have concentrated on {{the sensitivity}} of quantum dot <b>semiconductor</b> <b>lasers</b> to the influence of optical feedback [2, 3].

2500|$|The {{difference}} between the photon-emitting <b>semiconductor</b> <b>laser</b> and a conventional phonon-emitting (non-light-emitting) semiconductor junction diode lies {{in the type of}} semiconductor used, one whose physical and atomic structure confers the possibility for photon emission. These photon-emitting semiconductors are the so-called [...] "direct bandgap" [...] semiconductors. The properties of silicon and germanium, which are single-element semiconductors, have bandgaps that do not align in the way needed to allow photon emission and are not considered [...] "direct." [...] Other materials, the so-called compound semiconductors, have virtually identical crystalline structures as silicon or germanium but use alternating arrangements of two different atomic species in a checkerboard-like pattern to break the symmetry. The transition between the materials in the alternating pattern creates the critical [...] "direct bandgap" [...] property. Gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, gallium antimonide, and gallium nitride are all examples of compound semiconductor materials {{that can be used to}} create junction diodes that emit light.|$|E
2500|$|For a laser in a nanocavity, {{spontaneous}} emission (SE) from the gain medium {{is enhanced by}} the Purcell effect, equal to the quality factor or Q-factor of the cavity divided by the effective mode field volume, F = Q/Vmode. Therefore, reducing the volume of an optical cavity can dramatically increase this factor, which can {{have the effect of}} decreasing the input power threshold for lasing. This also means that the response time of {{spontaneous emission}} from a gain medium in a nanocavity also decreases, the result being that the laser may reach lasing steady state picoseconds after it starts being pumped. A laser formed in a nanocavity therefore may be modulated via its pump source at very high speeds. Spontaneous emission rate increases of over 70 times modern <b>semiconductor</b> <b>laser</b> devices have been demonstrated, with theoretical laser modulation speeds exceeding 100GHz, an order of magnitude higher than modern semiconductor lasers, and higher than most digital oscilloscopes. Nanophotonic resonators have also been applied to create nanoscale filters [...] and photonic chips ...|$|E
2500|$|The first working laser was {{demonstrated}} on 16 May 1960 by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories. When first invented, {{they were called}} [...] "a solution looking for a problem". Since then, lasers have become a multibillion-dollar industry, finding utility in thousands of highly varied applications. The first application of lasers visible in {{the daily lives of}} the general population was the supermarket barcode scanner, introduced in 1974. The laserdisc player, introduced in 1978, was the first successful consumer product to include a laser, but the compact disc player was the first laser-equipped device to become truly common in consumers' homes, beginning in 1982. These optical storage devices use a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>laser</b> less than a millimetre wide to scan the surface of the disc for data retrieval. Fibre-optic communication relies on lasers to transmit large amounts of information at the speed of light. Other common applications of lasers include laser printers and laser pointers. Lasers are used in medicine in areas such as bloodless surgery, laser eye surgery, and laser capture microdissection and in military applications such as missile defence systems, electro-optical countermeasures (EOCM), and lidar. Lasers are also used in holograms, bubblegrams, laser light shows, and laser hair removal.|$|E

40|$|A long-standing {{challenge}} for <b>semiconductor</b> <b>lasers</b> is scaling the optical power and brightness of many diode lasers by coherent beam combination. Because single-mode <b>semiconductor</b> <b>lasers</b> have limited power available {{from a single}} element, {{there is a strong}} motivation to coherently combine the outputs of many elements for applications including industrial lasers for materials processing, free space optical communications, and defense.
