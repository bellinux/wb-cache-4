2500|$|It is {{conventionally}} {{believed that}} SSI is a purely beneficial effect, {{and it can}} conveniently be neglected for conservative design. SSI provisions of seismic design codes are optional and allow designers to reduce the design base shear of buildings by considering <b>soil-structure</b> <b>interaction</b> (SSI) as a beneficial effect. The main idea behind the provisions is that the soil-structure system can be replaced with an equivalent fixed-base model with a longer period and usually a larger damping ratio. Most of the design codes use oversimplified design spectra, which attain constant acceleration {{up to a certain}} period, and thereafter decreases monotonically with period. [...] Considering <b>soil-structure</b> <b>interaction</b> makes a structure more flexible and thus, increasing the natural period of the structure compared to the corresponding rigidly supported structure. [...] Moreover, considering the SSI effect increases the effective damping ratio of the system. [...] The smooth idealization of design spectrum suggests smaller seismic response with the increased natural periods and effective damping ratio due to SSI, which is the main justification of the seismic design codes to reduce the design base shear when the SSI effect is considered. The same idea also forms the basis of the current common seismic design codes such as ASCE 7-10 and ASCE 7-16. Although, the mentioned idea, i.e. reduction in the base shear, works well for linear soil-structure systems, it is shown that it cannot appropriately capture the effect of SSI on yielding systems. More recently, Khosravikia et al. evaluated the consequences of practicing the SSI provisions of ASCE 7-10 and those of 2015 National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), which form the basis of the 2016 edition of the seismic design standard provided by the ASCE. They showed that SSI provisions of both NEHRP and ASCE 7-10 result in unsafe designs for structures with surface foundation on moderately soft soils, but NEHRP slightly improves upon the current provisions for squat structures. For structures on very soft soils, both provisions yield conservative designs where NEHRP is even more conservative. Finally, both provisions yield near-optimal designs for other systems.|$|E
40|$|Soil-facing {{mechanical}} interactions play {{an important}} role in the behavior of earth retaining walls. Generally, numerical analysis of earth retaining structures requires the use of interface elements between dissimilar component materials to model <b>soil-structure</b> <b>interactions</b> and to capture the transfer of normal and shear stresses through these discontinuities. In the finite element method PLAXIS software program, <b>soil-structure</b> <b>interactions</b> can be modelled using “zero-thickness” interface elements between the soil and structural components. These elements use a strength/stiffness reduction factor that is applied to the soil adjacent to the interface. However, in some numerical codes where the zerothickness elements (or other similar special interface elements) are not provided, the use of continuum elements to model <b>soil-structure</b> <b>interactions</b> is the only option. The continuum element approach allows more control of the interface features (i. e., material strength and stiffness properties) as well as the element sizes and shapes at the interfaces. This paper proposes parameter values for zerothickness elements that will give the same numerical outcomes as those using continuum elements in PLAXIS. The numerical results show good agreement for the computed loads transferred from soil to structure using both methods (i. e., zero-thickness elements and continuum elements at interfaces).

40|$|The {{integral}} abutment bridge (IAB) {{constituted by}} the superstructure and the substructure can achieve a composite action responding {{as a single}} structural unit by eliminating or reducing expansion joints and bearings. Accordingly, the construction and maintenance costs can be reduced. Therefore, the IAB concept has recently become a topic of remarkable interest among bridge engineers, not only for newly built bridges but also during refurbishment processes. The research topic concerns the retrofit of existing bridges with the IAB concept. In order to investigate the retrofitting technique with the IAB concept, the literature survey on the practical applications of this approach in worldwide was carried out firstly, including retrofitting motivations, detailed processes and structural performance after retrofitting. Besides, another literature review on the critical issues of analysis on the IAB, such as <b>soil-structure</b> <b>interactions,</b> modelling approaches and plastic hinge simulations, was conducted {{in order to find}} out the most suitable method in modelling. The case study of a simply supported prestressed concrete bridge (named Viadotto Serrone) with three spans constructed in 1972 was analyzed, which has some durability problems nowadays. The finite element model was built, involving <b>soil-structure</b> <b>interactions,</b> non-linear behaviors and retrofitting processes. The original and updated Italian design codes are compared through static analysis and seismic analysis. Another investigation was conducted to prove the necessity of considering <b>soil-structure</b> <b>interactions</b> in the IAB. Based on the appropriate finite element model, a large number of static sensitive analyses were carried out, taking thermal actions; bridge types; soil conditions and substructure heights as parameters. Through analysing the responses of girders, piers, abutment stems and piles, some important factors and the corresponding influence were found, which could be adopted to guide the retrofitting technique with the IAB concept. Then, the verification was conducted in order to check if the existing sections could be reused without any changes and point out the most critical components, which need to be repaired or replaced. Moreover, the dynamic performance of bridge before and after retrofitting was investigated preliminarily through modal analysis and response spectrum analysis...|$|R

5000|$|It has {{conventionally}} {{been considered}} that <b>soil-structure</b> <b>interaction</b> has a beneficial {{effect on the}} seismic response of a structure. Many design codes {{have suggested that the}} effect of SSI can reasonably be neglected for the seismic analysis of structures. [...] This myth about SSI apparently stems from the false perception that SSI reduces the overall seismic response of a structure, and hence, leads to improved safety margins. Most of the design codes use oversimplified design spectra, which attain constant acceleration up to a certain period, and thereafter decreases monotonically with period. Considering <b>soil-structure</b> <b>interaction</b> makes a structure more flexible and thus, increasing the natural period of the structure compared to the corresponding rigidly supported structure. Moreover, considering the SSI effect increases the effective damping ratio of the system. The smooth idealization of design spectrum suggests smaller seismic response with the increased natural periods and effective damping ratio due to SSI. With this assumption, it was traditionally considered that SSI can conveniently be neglected for conservative design. In addition, neglecting SSI tremendously reduces the complication in the analysis of the structures which has tempted designers to neglect the effect of SSI in the analysis.|$|E

40|$|The world-wide {{development}} of new high-speed rail lines has led to more stringent design requirements for railway bridges, mainly because high-speed trains can cause resonance in the bridge superstructure. Dynamic simulations, often utilising time-consuming finite element analysis (FEA), have become essential for avoiding such problems. Therefore, guidelines and tools to assist structural engineers in the design process are needed. Considerable effort was spent {{at the beginning of}} the project, to develop simplified models based on two-dimensional (2 D) Bernoulli-Euler beam theory. First, a closed-form solution for proportionally damped multi-span beam, subjected to moving loads was derived (Paper I). The model was later used to develop design charts (Paper II) and study bridges on existing railway lines (Paper III). The model was then extended to non-proportionally damped beams (Paper IV) in order to include the effects of <b>soil-structure</b> <b>interactions.</b> Finally, the importance of the interaction between the surrounding soil and the bridge was verified by calibrating a finite element (FE) model by means of forced vibration tests of an end-frame bridge (Paper V). Recommendations on how to use the models in practical applications are discussed throughout the work. These recommendations include the effects of shear deformation, shear lag, train-bridge and <b>soil-structure</b> <b>interactions,</b> for which illustrative examples are provided. The recommendations are based on the assumption that the modes are well separated, so that the response at resonance is governed by a single mode. The results of the work show that short span bridges, often referred to as `simple´ bridges, are the most problematic with respect to dynamic effects. These systems are typically, non-proportionally damped systems that require detailed analyses to capture the `true´ behaviour. Studying this class of dynamic system showed that they tend to contain non-classical modes that are important for the structure response. For example, the bending mode is found to attain maximum damping when its undamped natural frequency is similar to that of a non-classical mode. QC 20170213 </p...|$|R
