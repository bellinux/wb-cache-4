50|$|On 11 August 2014, a {{summarised}} <b>specifications</b> <b>sheet</b> for the Proton Iriz {{was leaked}} online. while on 22 August 2014, Proton Chief Technical Officer (CTO) Abdul Rashid Musa held a media briefing on the upcoming P2-30A. The briefing detailed that two new engines will be offered, a 1.3 litre and a 1.6 litre, {{both of which}} incorporate variable valve timing (VVT) technology for more power and improved fuel-efficiency. The new Proton {{will be able to}} travel from Bukit Kayu Hitam in the very north of the Malay Peninsula to Johor Bahru in the very south, a journey of around 800 kilometres (500 miles) in just a single tank of petrol. It is however worth noting that Proton's older CamPro CPS and more recent CamPro CFE also offer VVT technology. The new 1.3 and 1.6 engines will also offer reduced emissions, in line with Proton's intentions to sell the P2-30A in markets which impose taxes based on emissions such as the European Union. The car will also be offered with an electric power steering (EPS) system for ease of steering and improved fuel-efficiency, along with a choice of either manual or automatic transmission. Proton claims that the new engines will be 10% more fuel-efficient in comparison to the older CamPro engines. Additionally, Azlan Othman, Proton's Head of Styling mentioned that the new GSC will maintain Proton's design philosophy of ‘timeless beauty’. In his words, “We don’t need to be trendy, and then forgotten. We need to be timeless, to have designs that last.” In terms of safety, the Proton GSC will launch as the safest Proton car yet, safer even than the bigger and more expensive Prevé and Suprima S. It will be equipped with no less than 10 computerised electronic systems, 6 airbags and Proton's Reinforced Safety Structure (RESS) with Hot Press Forming (HPF) technology. The P2-30A will be offered in at least 3 variants, namely ‘Standard’, ‘Executive’ and ‘Premium’, in a range of seven different colours. Proton also iterated that the GSC is not a direct successor or replacement to the Savvy as initially believed by the media, but is instead a separate new segment for Proton. The GSC will be a larger B-segment 5-door hatchback, unlike the much smaller A-segment Savvy.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePurpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{methodology}} for medical robot kinematics design developed using a knowledge-management approach. Design/methodology/approach - A classification of medical robots is proposed based on their kinematic characteristics and 76 robot specifications were collected in a catalogue. Then, having drawn a generic <b>specifications</b> <b>sheet,</b> rules were proposed to choose a structure from these specifications. Findings - Findings are situated at several levels: the catalogue, the classification of robots with respect to their kinematic characteristics, a generic and specific <b>specifications</b> <b>sheet,</b> and an organigram to choose the most relevant structure from the specifications. Research limitations/implications - This structural synthesis represents a preliminary step in the design of medical robots which will be completed by an additional dimensional synthesis. Originality/value - This work offers a new methodology for medical robots design distinct from what is usually done for medical or industrial robots design using intuition, expertise and non-formal knowledge...|$|E

40|$|Market {{conditions}} and the situation inside electric bicycle producing companies require a product development process which ensures that customer requirements are met and problems in product design are identified at an early stage. Therefore, this research takes an analytical approach towards the development of electric bicycles by applying Axiomatic Design, which offers both a holistic framework for product development as well as analytical mapping in between the individual steps of the design process. The application is done {{as a case study}} at a German electric bicycle manufacturing company and based on a collection of customer feedback as well as the contribution of the company’s management. In the design process, functional requirements and design parameters are formulated and a design matrix is created to identify and resolve coupling issues. Further, constraints such as price, weight and ease of use are taken into account and process variables for practical implementation are suggested. The study results in recommendations for a <b>specifications</b> <b>sheet</b> of a new electric bicycle model. It is concluded that Axiomatic Design is of substantial advantage to the case company’s product development.

Their ability to collect thousands of point data per second makes them an invaluable tool in many areas from engineering to historical reconstruction.

Proc. 912, 197 (2006) ] {{has shown}} that only few {{contemporary}} tools are able to measure reliably (within the international technology roadmap for semiconductors <b>specifications)</b> <b>sheet</b> resistances on ultrashallow (sub- 50 -nm) chemical-vapor-deposited layers [T. Clarysse, Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. 912, 197 (2006) ], especially {{in the presence of}} medium/highly doped underlying layers (representative for well/halo implants). Here the authors examine more closely the sheet resistance anomalies which have recently been observed between junction photovoltage (JPV) based tools and a micrometer-resolution four-point probe (M 4 PP) tool on a variety of difficult, state-of-the-art sub- 32 -nm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor structures (low energy and cluster implants, with/without halo, flash- and laser-based millisecond anneal). Conventional four-point probe tools fail on almost all of these samples due to excessive probe penetration, whereas in several cases variable probe spacing (using a conventional spreading resistance probe tool) [T. Clarysse, Mater. Sci. Eng. R. 47, 123 (2004) ] still gives useful values to within about 20 %- 35 % due to its limited probe penetration (5 - 10 nm at 5 g load). M 4 PP measurements give systematically a sensible and reproducible result. This is also the case for JPV-based sheet resistance measurements, although these appear to be prone to correct calibration procedures and are not designed for the characterization of multijunctions. Moreover, in a significant number of cases, residual damage and/or unexpected junction-leakage currents appear to induce a strong signal reduction, limiting the applicability of the JPV technique. This has been further investigated by transmission-electron microscopy, high carrier-injection photomodulated optical-reflectance, and Synopsis-Sentaurus device simulations...|$|E
