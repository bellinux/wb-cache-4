40|$|A {{research}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the effects of various container designs on growth and root deformation of Eucalyptus viminalis. Eucalyptus was selected for the study because of its ability to produce deep roots and its acceptability in landscaping industry of all Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The experiment was carried out over two years. In the first year, three-month-old bare root seedlings of E. viminalis were transplanted into three different containers, namely, Root trainers, <b>spring</b> <b>rings</b> and conventional containers. After a period of one-year growth, a subset of plants from each treatment lot was destructively harvested to determine the growth parameters, shoot, and dry mass weight and root deformation. At the beginning of the second year, the remaining plants in the containers were transplanted into open field to study the landscape performance of container-grown plants. For the plants grown in containers, {{there were no significant differences}} noticed on shoot characteristics among the containers. The poorest root architecture was observed in conventional pots; whereas, <b>spring</b> <b>rings</b> and root trainers reduced the percentage of deformed root mass. When the plants were transplanted to an arid landscape, plant height, and dry biomass did not significantly differ between the treatments. However, the plants grown in root trainers produced largest roots, well-distributed in the soil and detected less deformed roots than the other containers. The effect of the <b>spring</b> <b>rings</b> on plants grown in the landscape was obvious visually during research period in the short-term, but was not apparent from growth quantification. To obtain quality tree seedlings to support the horticultural industry, it is recommended to continue the application of R&D on container and plant relation.

50|$|Staab’s creations are {{site-specific}} {{and made}} from local, renewable materials. Bridging land and sky, {{the scope of}} the work reflects the artist’s arm span, his upward reach, his stride, his size and strength. The artworks devolve back into the landscape—seashore, river, wetland, or forest—after Staab’s act of creation in a place is finished. In fact, his work is so vulnerable to wind and waves that sometimes he wonders when he leaves the site at night if it will still be there the next morning. His reed sculptures sometimes last a few months or they may be flattened before completion. Curator Nicholas Frank locates Staab as a second-generation Earthworks artist, and Staab's photographic documentations attest to the site- and time-sensitive environmental works that he has executed in various ecosystems. Staab's ephemeral sculptures are constructed from natural materials such as reeds, willow shoots and bamboo.

The spring elements are designed as a plurality of <b>spring</b> <b>ring</b> frames (3) that surround the mirror plate (2) substantially in the mirror plate plane of the mirror plate, wherein the innermost <b>spring</b> <b>ring</b> frame (3) adjacent to the mirror plate (2) is connected to the mirror plate (2) at two opposite connection points (4), the <b>spring</b> <b>ring</b> frames are connected among each other at two opposite connection points (7, 8, 13) in each case, and the outermost <b>spring</b> <b>ring</b> frame (3) adjacent to the substrate (4) is connected to the substrate (4) at two opposite connection points (6, 12).

40|$|Ring springs are {{frictional}} devices {{consisting of}} {{inner and outer}} ring elements assembled to form a spring stack. External load applied to the spring produces sliding action across mating ring interfaces. Large amounts of energy, as much as 60 - 70 % of the total cycle energy, may be absorbed in overcoming frictional forces. This thesis details the characteristics and dynamic behaviour of <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> systems and describes the design and testing of a seismic isolation system that uses <b>ring</b> <b>springs.</b> Initially the characteristics and fundamental dynamic behaviour of single-degree-of-freedom mass/ring spring systems are studied. This study uses a model based upon the non-linear force/deflection characteristics of the <b>ring</b> <b>spring.</b> A prototype <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> cartridge that enables dynamic inputs {{to be applied to}} a <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> was then designed and subjected to short duration shock excitation. Experimental results are compared with those given by computer simulation and are seen to be in good agreement. Ring springs have been identified as suitable devices for use in earthquake-resistant structures. A particularly attractive candidate for use of <b>ring</b> <b>springs</b> is in protecting columnar structures during earthquakes. To enable further study, a pivotal rocking seismic isolation system was developed. So that computational analyses of these systems could be undertaken, the <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> model has been incorporated within the computer program RUAUMOKO. Dynamic analyses using RUAUMOKO show that pivotal rocking isolation systems can significantly reduce structural loads during short period type earthquakes. Subsequently, a pivotal rocking seismic isolation system was designed and manufactured. Shaker table tests were then carried out on the rocking system for a range of earthquake inputs. The experimental results show that for columnar structures with fundamental periods in the range of dominant spectral accelerations, structural loads can be significantly reduced during short period type earthquakes. Experimental results compare well with those given by computer simulation, thus confirming the effectiveness of the isolation system. The work outlined in this thesis has established a basis from which further research can be undertaken. The pivotal rocking seismic isolation system developed has potential application to protecting a wide range of columnar structures during short period type earthquakes...|$|R

40|$|The {{final design}} of the {{structural}} system for the ITER EC H&CD upper launcher is in progress. Many design features of the preliminary design are under revision with the aim to achieve the built-to-print-status. This paper deals with design and analysis of a bolted joint for the Blanket Shield Module with special perspective on Remote Handling capability. The BSM of the ECH Launcher {{is attached to the}} Launcher Main Frame by a bolted joint conceived so that in the Hot Cell Facility, RH maintenance can be performed on internal components. The joint must be capable to resist very high Electro-Magnetic loads from disruptions, while it has to sustain substantial thermal cycling during operation. Thus the need for a rigid and reliable design is essential. Beside the set of pre-stressed bolts the flanges were therefore equipped with additional shear keys to divert radial moments away from the bolts. Main focus of the work performed was the mechanical {{design of the}} joint and the assessment of the structural integrity with respect to the loads applied and its capability for maintenance by RH procedures. To fulfill a major aspect of the RH requirements, the bolts were designed as captive in order to avoid their accidental removal from the joint. The captive bolt design is based on a concept that uses a dedicated <b>spring</b> <b>ring,</b> a standard spiral spring and a tensioning screw with two threads to secure the bolts in a form-locking stop. The final approval phase of the RH compatibility foresees simulations in Virtual Reality and physical tests on prototypes...|$|E

50|$|Tolerance <b>Rings</b> are {{radially}} <b>sprung</b> <b>rings</b> {{that are}} press fitted between two mating components {{to act as}} frictional fasteners. They are flexible shims designed to fix two cylindrical parts together. The wavelike protrusions that run around the circumference of the ring generate a retention force to provide an optimal fit between the two mating components {{without the need for}} adhesive or excessive assembly force, simplifying the process for manufacturers. They allow for any misalignment caused by thermal expansion or excessive vibration. Tolerance rings can be used as bearing mounts and as a means of dealing with torque transfer, torque overload protection and axial slip between mating components. They are often used to isolate undesirable vibration in engines and electric motors, for noise-free mechanism operation in passenger vehicles and domestic appliances, where noise reduction has become a major trend in recent years. Modifications to tolerance rings can be made to tune the dynamic stiffness and, therefore, the frequencies that can be isolated.|$|R
40|$|Lead {{extrusion}} dampers {{have been}} used to dissipate seismic energy in structures and can contribute to damage avoidance design (DAD) rocking connections. In rocking connections that utilises unbound post-tensioned tendons, re-centering of the overall structure is typical. However, the lead extrusion dampers alone are strictly dissipative, have no inherent self-centering and without careful integration into a structural system can lead to residual story drifts. In this study a modified version of High Force-To Volume (HF 2 V) extrusion damper is introduced to overcome the lack of inherent re-centring, while maintaining the energy absorption capability. The new device is a combination of HF 2 V and <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> dampers to provide an overall device with large energy dissipation and inherent self-centering. Response spectral analysis for multiple, probabilistically scaled earthquake suites are used to delineate the displacement reduction factors due to the added damping. Hysteresis analysis of the device under a variety of seismic loadings are also performed and design plots are provided for different sized dampers. Overall, the results indicate an important trade-off between force contributions from the HF 2 V and <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> components. Moreover, increasing the <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> participation force level leads to less residual displacement in exchange for less reduction in peak displacement. This approach of larger <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> contributions shows less dependence on the structural period, indicating a robustness of the design to a broad spectrum of ground motion inputs...|$|R

40|$|Shape memory alloys (SMAs) have {{recently}} emerged as promising material candidates for structural seismic resisting purposes. Most {{of the existing}} SMA-based strategies, however, {{are based on the}} wire or rod form of SMAs, where issues such as gripping complexity and fracture may exist. This paper presents a proof-of-concept study on an innovative type of SMA-based self-centring system, namely, a superelastic SMA <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> system. The proposed system includes a series of inner high-strength steel (HSS) rings and outer superelastic SMA rings stacked in alternation with mating taper faces, where the resisting load is provided by the wedging action which tends to expand the outer rings and concurrently to squeeze the inner rings. The superelastic effect of the SMA offers energy dissipation and a driving force for recentring, and the frictional effect over the taper face further contributes to the overall resisting load and energy dissipation. The feasibility of the new system is carefully examined via numerical studies considering the parameters of ring thickness, taper angle, and coefficient of friction. The key hysteretic responses, including resisting load, stiffness, stress distributions, source of residual deformation, energy dissipation, and equivalent viscous damping, are discussed in detail. The behaviour of the SMA <b>ring</b> <b>springs</b> is also studied via analytical models, and the analytical predictions are found to agree well with the numerical results. Finally, two practical applications of the new system, namely self-centring HS-SMA <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> connections, and self-centring SMA <b>ring</b> <b>spring</b> dampers, are discussed via comprehensive numerical studies.

40|$|Abstract: A shift force {{simulator}} for {{manual transmission}} is developed {{to estimate the}} shift force that is transmitted to the driver’s hand. In order to develop the simulator, dynamic models of the external linkage, internal linkage, synchronizer and drivetrain are obtained. The synchronizing motion is modelled as seven steps depending on {{the relative displacement of}} the sleeve to the <b>ring</b> <b>spring,</b> outer <b>ring</b> chamfer and gear chamfer. The chamfer-to-chamfer contact mechanism is modelled as a linear spring. In addition, a driver model is proposed to simulate the driver’s shift lever operation. Based on the dynamic model of each element, a shift force simulator is developed. The simulator calculates the sleeve displacement, cone torque, index torque, sleeve force, shift force and the speed of the input and output shaft. It is found that the shift force by the simulator shows a good correlation with the test results, and it is expected that the shift force simulator developed in this study {{can be used as a}} useful design tool to evaluate the shift feeling in the initial design stage...|$|R

For the experiment 22 mature pine trees were selected, where the damage was simulated by ringing of the trunks. Six trees were left as a comparison samples, 8 pines were ringed {{in the summer of}} 2013 and the 8 remaining trees were ringed in the spring of 2014. 20 needles from this year's shoots were subjected to anatomical analysis. Needles were measured following values: sectional area, the central cylinder area, width and height of the needles. It was found that summer ringing lead to a reduction in the anatomical parameters monitored relative to the comparison samples. In contrast, from the <b>spring</b> <b>ringing,</b> it was detected that there was an increase of monitored parameters over comparison samples. We assume that the prevention of the flow of assimilates to the roots has caused their accumulation in the aboveground parts, which resulted in an increased growth of needles. The results show that the damage of the trunk leads to significant changes in the anatomical structure of the needles and these changes consequently lead to the death of the specimen. For these reasons it is necessary to defend the trunk against any damage. The most important measure is to prevent the damage of the trunk in the form of fencing, or using various barriers...|$|R
