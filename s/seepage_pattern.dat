40|$|Field {{evidence}} suggests that water flow in unsaturated fracture systems may occur along fast preferential flow paths. However, conventional macroscale continuum approaches generally predict the downward migration of water as a spatially uniform wetting front subjected to strong inhibition into the partially saturated rock matrix. One possible cause of this discrepancy may be the spatially random geometry of the fracture surfaces, and hence, the irregular fracture aperture. Therefore, a numerical model was developed in this study to investigate the effects of geometric features of natural rock fractures on liquid seepage and solute transport in 2 -D planar fractures under isothermal, partially saturated conditions. The fractures were conceptualized as 2 -D heterogeneous porous media that are characterized by their spatially correlated permeability fields. A statistical simulator, which uses a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, was employed to generate synthetic permeability fields. Hypothesized geometric features {{that are expected to}} be relevant for seepage behavior, such as spatially correlated asperity contacts, were considered in the SA algorithm. Most importantly, a new perturbation mechanism for SA was developed in order to consider specifically the spatial correlation near conditioning asperity contacts. Numerical simulations of fluid flow and solute transport were then performed in these synthetic fractures by the flow simulator TOUGH 2, assuming that the effects of matrix permeability, gas phase pressure, capillary/permeability hysteresis, and molecular diffusion can be neglected. Results of flow simulation showed that liquid seepage in partially saturated fractures is characterized by localized preferential flow, along with bypassing, funneling, and localized ponding. <b>Seepage</b> <b>pattern</b> is dominated by the fraction of asperity contracts, and their shape, size, and spatial correlation. However, the correlation structure of permeability field is less important than the spatial correlation of asperity contacts. A faster breakthrough was observed in fractures subjected to higher normal stress, accompanied with a nonlinearly decreasing trend of the effective permeability. Interestingly, seepage dispersion is generally higher in fractures with intermediate fraction of asperity contacts; but it is lower for small or large fractions of asperity contacts. However, it may become higher if the ponding becomes significant. Transport simulations indicate that tracers bypass dead-end pores and travel along flow paths that have less flow resistance. Accordingly, tracer breakthrough curves generally show more spreading than breakthrough curves for water. Further analyses suggest that the log-normal time model generally fails to fit the breakthrough curves for water, but it is a good approximation for breakthrough curves for the tracer...|$|E
40|$|Water use and {{groundwater}} rises are two important problems facing irrigators {{in the southern}} irrigated region of NSW. Water loss through percolation has been extensively studied for irrigated farms and major supply channels {{but there have been}} no studies of loss through on-farm channels and drains. This study aimed to determine the magnitude of percolation losses attributable to on-farm channels and drains. It also aimed to consider approaches and for need to identify problem were and to consider likely remediation techniques. Investigations were carried out within selected farms in Coleambally and Murrumbidgee Irrigation Areas in southern NSW during the irrigation seasons of 1997 / 98, 1998 / 99 and 1999 / 00. The Idaho Seepage Meter was used to make point infiltration measurements. Seepage losses were not estimated for all channels on every farm but for only those channels being used by the landholder in the periods seepage measurements were taken. Only 3 of the 9 farms investigated were using all of the channels and drains on the farm during monitoring activities. Only permanent channel and drain structures on the farm were measured. This potentially causes the annual seepage losses calculated per farm to be underestimated. The Idaho Seepage Meter was used for this investigation. Measuring seepage using the Idaho Seepage Meter is rapid, direct, and cheap. The success of this method depends upon the high degree of homogeneity in natural soils. Tests using seepage meters can be conducted in channels without interfering with their normal water delivery operation. Three or four measurements were taken across channels and drains at intervals of 50 - 100 metres. Due to the age and lack of maintenance of these channels their cross-sections had deteriorated. In these situations it was difficult to place the Idaho Seepage Meter {{on the sides of the}} channels. Extreme care was taken to cause minimal disturbance to the local soil so that the <b>seepage</b> <b>pattern</b> would not be appreciably affected. A series of test wells was drilled adjacent to the irrigation channels and drains using information obtained from EM 31 electromagnetic surveys. The Idaho Seepage Meter can be used to rapidly locate channel sections with high seepage losses. This enables total seepage losses from a section of channel to be estimated economically. The seepage results from 15 - 30 year old channels indicate that a combination of weeds and sediment deposition may be the major factor for reduction of seepage. Silt sediments were deposited on the channel bed, or on only part of the bed where the channel was curved, not the entire wetted perimeter of the channel. However, some old channels, which were cleaned prior to the irrigation season, had significant seepage volumes. In new channels and drains low seepage rates were also found at many sites. These sites could have been influenced by factors such as compaction beneath the bed of channel, soil sodicity, biological activity, and slope/bend of channel, and silt deposition in the channel bed. EM- 31 surveys were used to characterize soil differences along channel and drainage lines and the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) values were compared with direct seepage measurements using an Idaho Seepage Meter. This method proved successful in identifying actual seepage sites. ECa values obtained from the EM- 31 surveys provided an insight into the most likely locations to have high seepage rates. The EM- 31 method was shown to be an important initial predictive tool. Highest seepage rates were found where ECa values were low. In some areas seepage rates were found to be low despite low ECa values at these locations. These anomalies were attributed to various factors which included compaction of substrate, clay layers below channel bed, sodicity, biological activity and sediment deposition. Combining the seepage-monitoring program with the EM 31 electromagnetic survey method proved to be highly effective in detailing the nature and extent of the problem. Despite its limitations, the EM 31 method is considered to be an important predictive tool in the first stage of loss assessment. Investigation was carried out with in selected farms to quantifying seepage losses from sections of channels and drains in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area and Coleambally Irrigation Area. This study enabled those sections with high seepage rates to be identified. As the price of water becoming a realistic figure in terms of meeting actual cost, water distribution efficiencies are being very closely examined. Water loss through seepage in on-farm channels and drains is one of the many elements of the system under investigation. Detection and accurate measurement of seepage is important for the efficient and effective management of on-farm water. However, it is necessary to firstly determine whether a problem exists, and secondly to quantify the extent and seriousness of that problem, before putting resources into seepage control. At high seepage rates it is uneconomical to apply the various treatments available. It is suggested that only methods compatible with and complementary to the natural sealing process will be successful. Lining a leaky channel site will not always completely eliminate seepage losses. In fact, all that can be reasonably expected is a reduction in the seepage rate. The amount of reduction will depend upon the lining used and the magnitude of the loss prior to lining. Investigation sites were established within irrigation channels and drains on each of nine farms, each with an average of approximately 3 - 4 km of unlined on-farm channels carrying water within the farm boundaries and about 1 - 3 km of drains that are used for recycling runoff water...|$|E

30|$|At present, {{there are}} many {{researches}} on fluid percolation characteristics in porous media, but the research of <b>seepage</b> flow <b>patterns</b> and relevant mechanism in heterogeneous low-permeability reservoirs is not systematic and perfect, and experiments are limited to relationship between pressure difference and fluid volume (Kortekaas 1985; Mala and Li 1999; Qu and Kong 2002) or experimental determination of relative permeability curves of natural cores (Zhang et al. 2004; Li et al. 2008). Relevant research of pressure gradient distribution for characterizing <b>seepage</b> flow <b>patterns</b> on plane is rarely studied.

Numerical modeling is utilized {{in conjunction with the}} geophysical measurements to predict variably-saturated flow through typical two-dimensional dam cross-sections as a function of reservoir elevation. Several different flow scenarios are investigated based on the known hydrogeology, as well as information about typical subsurface structures gained from the resistivity survey. The flow models are also used to simulate the bulk electrical resistivity in the subsurface under varying saturation conditions, as well as the self-potential response using petrophysical relationships and electrokinetic coupling equations. The self-potential survey consists of 512 measurements on the downstream area of the dam, and corroborates known seepage areas on the northwest side of the dam. Two direct current resistivity profiles, each approximately 2, 500 ft (762 m) long, indicate a broad sediment channel under the northwest side of the dam, which may be a significant seepage pathway through the foundation. A focusing of seepage in low-topography areas downstream of the dam is confirmed from the numerical flow simulations, which is also consistent with past observations. Little evidence of seepage is identified from the self-potential data on the southeast side of the dam, also consistent with historical records, though one possible area of focused seepage is identified near the outlet works.

40|$|A recent {{evaluation}} of Martis Creek Dam highlighted {{the potential for}} dam failure due to either seepage or an earthquake on nearby faults. In 1972, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed this earthen dam, located within the Truckee Basin {{to the north of}} Lake Tahoe, CA for water storage and flood control. Past attempts to raise the level of the Martis Creek Reservoir to its design level have been aborted due to seepage at locations downstream, along the west dam abutment, and {{at the base of the}} spillway. In response to these concerns, the U. S. Geological Survey has undertaken a comprehensive suite of geophysical investigations aimed at understanding the interplay between geologic structure, <b>seepage</b> <b>patterns,</b> and reservoir and groundwater levels. This paper concerns the geologic structure surrounding Martis Creek Dam and emphasizes the importance of a regional-scale understanding to the interpretation of engineering-scale geophysical data. Our studies reveal a thick package of sedimentary deposits interbedded with Plio-Pleistocene volcanic flows; both the deposits and the flows are covered by glacial outwash. Magnetic field data, seismic tomography models, and seismic reflections are used to determine the distribution and chronology of the volcanic flows. Previous estimates of depth to basement (or the thickness of the interbedded deposits) was 100 m. Magnetotelluric soundings suggest that electrically resistive bedrock may be up to 2500 m deep. Both the Polaris Fault, identified outside of the study area using airborne LiDAR, and the previously unnamed Martis Creek Fault, have been mapped through the dam area using ground and airborne geophysics. Finally, as determined by direct-current resistivity imaging, time-domain electromagnetic sounding, and seismic refraction, the paleotopography of the interface between the sedimentary deposits and the overlying glacial outwash plays a principal role both in controlling groundwater flow and in the distribution of the observed seepage...|$|R
40|$|Ca- and Fe-rich seepage in wet dune slacks often sustains oligotrophic, species rich {{vegetation}} as {{a result}} of reduced P availability. While this effect has been attributed to pH buffering, we tested whether Ca- and Fe-rich seepage also immobilised P in calcareous soils with a strong pH buffer. Two oligotrophic species (Carex flacca and Schoenus nigricans) and two eutrophic species (Calamagrostis epigejos and Molinia caerulea) were planted in experimental sods. After 4 months supply with water of seepage or infiltration quality, with or without the addition of P, soil P fractions and a number of plant physiological responses were measured. A field validation was performed in a flow-through lake in calcareous dunes where the seepage flow had been restored recently. The readily available water soluble P fraction (Pw) was reduced by more than 80 % by seepage, both in the greenhouse experiment and in the field, but the P Olsen-inorganic fraction was unaffected. All four test species had elevated N: P ratios in aboveground tissues when treated with seepage, indicating that seepage water had indeed reduced P availability to plants. Formation of dauciform roots by Carex flacca was diminished by P addition to less than 25 % of treatments without P addition, indicating sensitivity to P availability, while seepage on average halved production of these root structures. Dauciform root formation by Schoenus nigricans was unaffected by the P addition and the hydrological treatment. Biomass of the test species in the experiment as well as vegetation biomass and relative abundance of oligotrophic species in the field were unrelated to <b>seepage</b> <b>patterns,</b> suggesting that compensatory mechanisms enabled the plants to sustain biomass production within the time frame of this experiment. In conclusion, Ca- and Fe-rich seepage can lower P availability in soils with a strong pH buffer. In the long term, this may create favourable conditions for species that have low P requirements or efficient P uptake. In the short term, however, existing vegetation seems to be resilient to changes in P supply. © Springer 2005...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{performance}} of soil cover systems depends on both physical properties (including water retention characteristics, depth, and number and arrangement of materials), which define the soil cover design, and climatic conditions. While the physical properties {{can be addressed}} by sitespecific selection or completion criteria and through technical means, climatic conditions are out of anthropogenic control. Climate parameters are commonly used {{in the first instance}} to plan the cover design. However, for some climates commonly used climate indices such as the rainfall to evaporation ratio or annual means of meteorological parameters oversimplify the complexity of variable and partly erratic rainfall patterns. In this paper we present a climate-based planning framework for soil cover systems that explicitly considers climate variability. We demonstrate our approach based on a case study using historical rainfall and evaporation data from semi-arid Mount Isa (Queensland, Australia), where highly variable rainfall events are driven by monsoonal weather situations or intense convective storms. We use Hydrus- 1 D to simulate the seepage from two contrasting soil materials – a unimodal silt and a bimodal waste rock material. We run the model with a number of generated climate data based on the historical climate observations, and compare the <b>seepage</b> <b>patterns</b> for the two selected soil materials with uniform distributions of rainfall and evaporation. As hypothesised, maximum seepage events and number of large seepage events were several orders of magnitude higher for the waste rock material. Interestingly, under some climatic conditions (mainly determined by its variability) the average seepage was higher for silt material. In any case, climate variability had a great impact on the seepage patterns; i. e., the median seepage, the maximum seepage events. The number of large seepage events was several orders of magnitude higher when including the variability of events compared with the control model, where rainfall and evaporation distributions were uniform. This indicates the critical role climate variability plays for the {{performance of}} soil cover systems, and the need to implement a similar approach into postmining planning schemes...|$|R

Central sand bodies are considered to originate from shallow deltas and sandy debris flows, and their formation conditions, microfacies composition, distribution models, and genetic classification are still poorly understood. Shallow meandering channel deltas are well developed in modern lacustrine basins of China. The Ordos Basin underwent a denudation period that lasted over 100  Ma during the Caledonian, and a general flattening of topography in the Late Paleozoic resulted in a small thickness difference of less than 30  m in the 8 th member of the Shihezi Formation.

40|$|A conference paper {{presented}} at the Fifth Australasian Conference on Hydraulics and Fluid Mechanics held at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand, December 1974. The Canterbury Plain stretches roughly 120 km along the Pacific coast and from the eastern foothills of the Southern Alps, at some 300 m elevation, it stretches roughly 60 km to the coast. A depth of sediment of several hundred metres has been measured near the coast. The sediments consist mainly of gravel and sand mixtures, lenses of gravelfree sand and layers of wind-blown and water-borne glacial silt. The three major rivers on the plain, the Waimakariri, the Rakaia and the Rangitata remain incised upstream over roughly half their length from the foothills to the coast. According to information collected by the N. Z. Geological Survey of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, by the North and South Canterbury Catchment Boards and the Ministry of Works and Development on ground- water contours, supported by field observations on <b>seepage</b> <b>patterns</b> along the river banks, groundwater in this upper section tends to move towards the rivers. Farther downstream the ground-water contours indicate a movement of water from the riverbeds to ground-water. Closer to the coast the levels of riverbeds, ground water and ground surface tend to intersect as evidenced by groundwater- fed streams and drainage problems. As far as the Waimakariri river is concerned, the river most studied because of its significance for water supply to the city of Christchurch, the contours indicate that the ground-water level dips below the river level a short distance downstream from where river incisement ceases, probably over a distance of 4 km. On the basis of river-flow measurements, recharge of ground water from the riverbed takes place in this section. Using the area-velocity method, a number of measurements have been made on river losses in this sector (summarized by Mandel, 1974), but owing to the difficulty that exists in measuring flow in braided rivers, a certain reservation still persists as to the reliability of the informationo Therefore, there remains an interest in obtaining corroboration and further information on the magnitude of the recharge and the factors that govern it. In the present work an attempt has been made to understand some of the basic factors involved in this recharge by studying the hydraulic characteristics of riverbed sediments. In a separate study the movement of fine particles within these sediments is studied and another study aims at improving on the measurement of river flow in braided channels by attempting to refine a dye-dilation method for this purpose...|$|R

Two field tests were conducted to investigate the effects of seepage in the vicinity of live and decaying tree root systems {{to examine the effects of}} live and decaying root systems on levee seepage and slope stability. The first field test involved the construction of parallel trenches in the vicinity of a eucalyptus stump located along the landside of the northern levee bordering the American River adjacent to the California Exposition and State Fair. A live hackberry tree with healthy roots was present at the toe of the levee. A control set of parallel trenches was constructed away from the eucalyptus stump. During the test, the upslope trench was flooded and maintained at constant head to induce slope-parallel seepage and the downslope trench was used to make observations and collect any intercepted seepage. Piezometers and tensiometers were installed to measure positive and negative pore water pressures within the zone of flow to describe the wetting and flow patterns as they evolved within the levee. Instrumentation was installed to assess the influence of the stump and its decomposing root system. Live roots, mammal burrows, and other features added complexity to the system. In addition to instrumentation data, visual observations were recorded during the 6 day flow test. During the flow test, wetting front and water flow patterns appeared to be dominated by flow through a network of shallow mammal burrows. Physical observation of the saturation front, as seen from the lower wall, confirmed that the area below the stump was the last location to saturate during the wetting test. Ground-based tripod light detection and ranging (T-LiDAR) was used to complement traditional logging and for constructing a 3 D model of the root system, burrows and stratigraphy. Preliminary computer simulations of the advance of the wetting front support the basic patterns observed in the field test. The second field experiment was conducted along the crown of a bypassed levee along an oxbow segment of the seven mile slough on Twitchell Island in Rio Vista, California. An 8 -foot deep crown trench was excavated to extend through the root system of a land side live oak tree, a water side valley oak tree, and a control section. The test was designed to evaluate the effects of seepage in the vicinity of live tree root systems. During the test, the crown trench was flooded and maintained at constant head to simulate a flood condition with water delivered from the center of the levee. Piezometers and tensiometers were installed to measure positive and negative pore water pressures, respectively, within the zone of flow to describe the wetting and flow patterns as they evolved within the levee. Burrow networks, fracturing, and gapping within levee soils, as well as variability of stratigraphic conditions across the site added complexity. Visual observations were made during the flow test to view surficial <b>seepage</b> and flow <b>patterns</b> from the surface in addition to continuous monitoring of subsurface instruments. The site contained an extensive network of muskrat burrows in addition to burrows by other species and the initial advance of the wetting front appeared to be related to burrowing activity. With increased time and saturation of levee soils, flow through macropores appeared to diminish. The levee appears to have been founded on overbank deposits comprised of lower permeability soils than the overlying levee fill. Water appeared to accumulate on this stratigraphic layer, driving <b>seepage</b> <b>patterns</b> on the landside of the levee. A break in this low permeability layer affected flow patterns while the slope of this layer toward this break appears to have added a three dimensional effect to flow patterns. Cracking was observed in the crown road along the levee crest within the first 24 hours of the flow test. After approximately 40 hours of flow, the waterside oak tree, which was initially leaning at an angle of approximately 43 degrees from horizontal, rotated an additional approximately 20 degrees into the slough, creating cracks and deformation along the waterside slope. A dye test was performed as a part of the experiment to better understand the extent of these burrows, their effect on flow patterns, and to better evaluate the role of these burrow networks in the deformations observed on the waterside slope during the flow test. Ground-based tripod light detection and ranging (T-LiDAR) was used to complement our efforts related to tracking deformations during the test. Based on calibrated numerical simulations, trees were found not to play a significant role in seepage-induced rotational or block failure of the levee slopes. However, where trees exhibit significant lean (center of mass extends beyond the fulcrum of the root plate), horizontal roots extending into the levee may place additional loads on the levee embankment. Loading of this type can be incorporated into two dimensional slope stability analyses, using mass-averaging to capture the three-dimensional impact of the tree. Tree overturning was evaluated at the waterside oak tree. Root forces were represented as a single horizontal force and a single vertical force. Horizontally oriented tree root loading increased faster than vertical loading in response to increasing slope angle, while the reverse was true for tree lean where vertical root forces increased more rapidly with increasing tree lean. The method was implemented and successfully captured the observed landside and waterside tree responses during the Crown Trench Seepage Test. The second part of this research focused on seismically induced permanent displacement of earth levees, embankments, and earth-fill slopes resulting from liquefaction below these earth structures. Deformations of this nature are not well captured in current seismic design practice. Ground remediation can be employed to reduce the hazards resulting from soil liquefaction for cases where the analytical tools predict poor seismic performance. There are not sufficient funds to repair all vulnerable levees in the system. Thus, robust analytical procedures are required to evaluate sections of levees where liquefiable foundation materials may lead to significant damage. Inertially driven ground movements of intermediate levels are the primary focus of this study. In these cases, the post-liquefaction static stability of the earth slope is greater than one, and seismically induced permanent displacements result primarily from earthquake shaking after liquefaction is triggered. Limited lateral spreads involving liquefaction of medium dense sand can produce seismic displacements on the order of several centimeters to a meter or more. These levels of seismic displacements are sufficient to damage severely levees. The most commonly employed simplified method for evaluation of seismic deformation at these intermediate levels relies on the concept post-liquefaction residual shear strength. For many practical cases, residual shear strength is ill-defined due to the ever changing resistance provided by soils that undergo repetitive dilative responses during cyclic loading. Where liquefied soils are sufficiently strong to resist flow failures, engineers lack satisfactory tools to evaluate the seismic performance of earth structures that overlie liquefiable soils. A nonlinear soil constitutive model (UBCSAND), which was developed by Professor Byrne and implemented in the finite difference program FLAC, is employed to evaluate seismic deformations of earth structures resulting from liquefaction-induced lateral movements. Analyses of one-element laboratory tests are performed first to develop trends within the UBCSAND soil model calibration parameters. The basic model parameters are correlated to (N 1) 60 values. The UBCSAND model also has four "fitting" parameters. Two of the four model parameters are varied in this study to evaluate the sensitivity of the results to these variations. Triggering is captured with values of the m_hfac 1 parameter with a typical range of 0. 5 to 2. 0 depending on relative density, CSR, and initial static shear stress. The trends identified are implemented in the back-analysis of several case histories, and the ability of the UBCSAND model within the program FLAC to capture observed deformations is evaluated. The numerical simulations of seismic performance at Moss Landing Marine Laboratory and Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute during the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake and at the Juvenile Hall Facility during the 1971 San Fernando Earthquake are shown to capture well the key features of these case histories. The study was generalized through a broader sensitivity study to investigate the seismic performance of earthen embankments built atop potentially liquefiable soils. Several representative levee sections on differing foundations are analyzed, wherein key characteristics, such as the thickness of the liquefiable layer and its relative density, are systematically varied to develop useful insights. The thickness of the liquefiable foundation layer impacted displacements in a non-linear pattern where displacement increased more rapidly as the liquefiable material layer thickness increases. As would be expected, combinations of thicker deposits of liquefiable foundation soils combined with higher embankments yielded the maximum displacement of the cases analyzed in this study. A suite of nine near-fault, forward-directivity, fault-normal soil earthquake ground motions and seven intermediate-field soil earthquake ground motions are used to reflect the seismic hazards most likely to control the design of levees within the San Joaquin-Sacramento delta region of California. The intense forward-directive 1994 Northridge Sylmar Converter Station motion yielded approximately twice as much displacement as the lower intensity backward-directive 1992 Landers Joshua Tree motion. The rate of increase of the calculated liquefaction-induced displacement with increasing Arias intensity was roughly linear for these embankment configurations for the entire suite of earthquake ground motions...|$|R
