5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} also {{considered}} to be sustainable thanks to its power to <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> Earth’s intricate ecosystems. By using geothermal sources of energy present generations of humans will not endanger the capability of future generations {{to use their own}} resources to the same amount that those energy sources are presently used. Further, due to its low emissions geothermal energy is considered to have excellent potential for mitigation of global warming.|$|E
5|$|Historian James Gunn's {{assessment}} of Amazing in the 1980s is that Mavor, Scithers and Price, who between them edited Amazing for a decade, {{were unable to}} <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> standards established by Ted White in the 1970s. Brian Stableford, by contrast, comments that both Scithers and Price made efforts to publish good material, and that the packaging, from 1991 onwards, was perhaps the best presented of any science fiction magazine.|$|E

5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and {{uranium-235}} (0.7204%). Isotope separation concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 {{for nuclear weapons}} and most nuclear power plants, except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> nuclear chain reaction. The concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve {{this is called a}} 'critical mass'.|$|E

5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Although Liverpool {{regained the}} {{championship}} a year later, the club's dominance waned. In February 1991, Dalglish resigned as Liverpool manager after an FA Cup replay against Merseyside rivals Everton, citing stress {{as the principal}} cause. His successor, Graeme Souness, struggled to <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> club's success with a conservative hierarchy and ageing squad, despite investing in youth players. Liverpool throughout the 1990s and 2000s declined as a league force and as of 2017, have not been crowned as top-flight champions.|$|E
5|$|Around AD1100, natives {{established}} adze quarries {{high up on}} Mauna Kea {{to extract}} the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and māmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> workers; and workshops creating the finished product.|$|E

5|$|By 1828, Brazil {{could no}} longer <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> war effort {{in the south and}} in April relinquished Cisplatina, which became the {{independent}} nation of Uruguay. Marques de Sousa was sent to Montevideo to serve under field marshal (present-day divisional general) Manuel Jorge Rodrigues, who commanded a Brazilian force temporarily stationed in the new country. On 29 March 1829, Marques de Sousa was made brevet (acting) major, and, on 28 August 1830, he was placed in command of the 6th company of 4th Regiment of Light Cavalry. Stationed in Rio Grande do Sul, the unit had previously been commanded by his father and his paternal grandfather.|$|E
5|$|By 1963, {{following}} some 15 {{years of}} unrelenting {{pressure from the}} police and the ABC, Stoumen decided he was no longer able financially to <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> fight. The cost of his long legal battle was more than $38,000. Sarria tried to enlist the owners of the city's other gay bars to help Stoumen pay his legal bills, but none offered any assistance. The ABC lifted the bar's liquor license in 1963, the night before its annual Halloween party. After a final defiant Halloween celebration at which only non-alcoholic beverages were served and an attempt to survive on food and soft drink sales, the Black Cat closed down for good in February 1964.|$|E
5|$|Dalglish's {{successor}} Graeme Souness won the FA Cup in {{his first}} full season in charge. In the newly formed Premier League, he struggled to <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> club's domestic successes, {{and was replaced by}} Roy Evans midway through the 1993–94 season. Liverpool improved to fourth the following season and won the Football League Cup. In 1998, Gérard Houllier was appointed co-manager alongside Evans. The arrangement lasted until November when Evans resigned and Houllier became the sole mananger. The club won a unique treble of trophies in 2001, and a year later finished second to Arsenal, their highest league finish in 11 years. Houllier departed the club in mid-2004.|$|E

5|$|During his labors to <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> {{provisional}} government, Johnson's lack {{of hearing}} {{from his family}} weighed heavily upon him. The only family member {{with whom he had}} contact was his son Madison ("Matty"), who had joined John Hunt Morgan's cavalry. Johnson admired and respected Morgan, and was pleased that his son had chosen to serve under him. In 1862, he requested by letter that his wife send their fifteen-year-old son Junius to serve in the Confederate Army. Despite Johnson's protestations that he would ensure his son's safety, his wife refused this request.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} {{in a series}} of slits usually cut by the mother's {{ovipositor}} in live branches or twigs of their food plants. On average about sixteen eggs, among a total batch of a few hundred, are laid in each slit. The batch all hatch around 70 days later – usually within a day or two of one another – but take longer in cold or dry conditions. Oviposition has been observed {{on a wide range of}} native and introduced plant species and can weaken the branches of young orchard trees such that they cannot <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> load of their fruit.|$|E
