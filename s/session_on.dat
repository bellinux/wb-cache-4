5|$|Some {{two hours}} after the court made its initial {{judgment}} in favour of van der Garde, the FIA published an entry list for the Australian Grand Prix that included both Nasr and Ericsson for Sauber following pre-event scrutineering. Despite this, neither driver took to the circuit during the first practice <b>session</b> <b>on</b> the Friday due to Sauber running {{the risk of having}} team assets seized for not complying with court orders. Nevertheless, based on media speculation about Bernie Ecclestone's intervention to avoid further negative publicity on the sport, Ericsson and Nasr did participate in that afternoon's second practice <b>session.</b> <b>On</b> Saturday, 14 March 2015, the dispute reached a temporary resolution thanks to van der Garde announcing that he would forego racing in Melbourne, with a view to finding a more permanent solution in the future. The Sauber team and its new drivers for 2015 were thus able to complete Saturday's qualifying session and a point-scoring race on the Sunday.|$|E

Vettel was again third fastest, more than six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. He was followed by teammate Räikkönen, Valtteri Bottas and Nico Hülkenberg in the Force India, all more than a second slower than Hamilton.|$|E
