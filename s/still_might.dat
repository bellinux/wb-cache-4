5|$|Johnson sought {{nomination}} by the 1868 Democratic National Convention in New York in July 1868. He remained {{very popular}} among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity by issuing, {{just before the}} convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis {{and a few others}} <b>still</b> <b>might</b> face trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative George H. Pendleton, who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and fell away as the ballots passed. On the 22nd ballot, former New York governor Horatio Seymour was nominated, and the President received only four votes, all from Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit <b>still</b> <b>might</b> represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E

Understanding {{whether it is the}} same engine driving all Seyfert 2s, the connection to radio-loud AGN, the mechanisms of the variability of some AGN that vary between the two types at very short time scales, and the connection of the AGN type to small- and large-scale environment remain important issues to incorporate into any unified model of active galactic nuclei.|$|E

25|$|Prisoners of many nationalities {{were kept}} at Auschwitz {{and parts of}} the complex were used as a brutal and deadly labor camp, but about 80% of the {{arriving}} Jews were directly selected for death (some 900,000 people). Auschwitz, unlike Treblinka or Bełżec, was not strictly a death camp, but it <b>still</b> <b>might</b> have produced the highest number of Jewish victims. Of Poland's prewar Jewish population of about or above three million, about or above 10% survived the war. Davies wrote of some 150,000 Jews surviving the war in Poland. Between 50,000 and 100,000 survived in hiding helped by other Poles according to Kochanski, between 30,000 and 60,000 according to Sowa. About 250,000 escaped German-occupied Poland and went mostly to the Soviet Union. At Treblinka (a site that, together with Auschwitz, produced the highest number of Jewish victims) and other extermination locations, Heinrich Himmler ordered measures intended to conceal the Nazi crimes and prevent their future detection.|$|E

500|$|Born in Jamaica to an English mother, Johnson {{played for}} the England Schoolboys team by virtue of going to school in England. He was called up to the England U21 squad in December 1997 for a 1998 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship {{qualification}} play-off game against Greece, but remained an unused substitute. After the game, he said: [...] "My chances with England are virtually gone now..I am ready if Jamaica come in for me. I was hoping for a game on Wednesday – and I <b>still</b> <b>might</b> {{have had a chance}} with England had they qualified for the last eight but that's the way it goes. I have enjoyed the experience of being with England but I am hoping to hear from Jamaica." [...] Johnson played his first senior international football in 1998, making a nine-minute cameo for the England B team under Glenn Hoddle in a 4–1 victory over Russia at Loftus Road.|$|E

500|$|The games {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, holding an aggregate score of 87.86% on GameRankings. Special praise {{was given to}} its multiplayer features: the ability to trade and battle Pokémon with one another. Craig Harris of IGN gave the games a [...] "masterful" [...] 10 out of 10, noting that: [...] "Even if you finish the quest, you <b>still</b> <b>might</b> not have all the Pokémon in the game. The challenge to catch 'em all is truly the game's biggest draw". He also commented on {{the popularity of the}} game, especially among children, describing it as a [...] "craze". GameSpot's Peter Bartholow, who gave the games a [...] "great" [...] 8.8 out of 10, cited the graphics and audio as somewhat primitive but stated that these were the games' only drawbacks. He praised the titles' replay value due to their customization and variety, and commented upon their universal appeal: [...] "Under its cuddly exterior, Pokémon is a serious and unique RPG with lots of depth and excellent multiplayer extensions. As an RPG, the game is accessible enough for newcomers to the genre to enjoy, but it will entertain hard-core fans as well. It's easily one of the best Game Boy games to date".|$|E
500|$|In the Kentucky Oaks on May 3 at Churchill Downs, Beholder {{started at}} odds of 9–1 {{in a field}} of ten fillies, with the Gulfstream Oaks winner Dreaming of Julia the 6–4 favorite. [...] It {{was the first time she}} had been shipped outside of California. [...] Beholder tracked the leader, Midnight Lucky, before moving into the lead in the homestretch but was {{overtaken}} in the closing stages by the 39–1 outsider Princess of Sylmar and finished second, beaten by half a length. Her loss was attributed in part to her behavior in the post parade. Without her training earmuffs, she was anxious and upset by the crowd noise, fought to get away from the track pony that was leading her to the gate, and partially fell down, forcing Gomez to jump off. Sportswriters described her as [...] "angry" [...] and adrenaline-filled, while Mandella described her as [...] "rattled." [...] After the race, Gomez speculated that if Princess of Sylmar had been closer as she passed, instead of well to the outside, Beholder's fighting instincts <b>still</b> <b>might</b> have been enough to have held out for the victory. [...] However, he also commented at the time that she relied on speed to win, and if she was slowed down, she had difficulty regaining momentum.|$|E
500|$|The American film {{reviewer}} Leonard Maltin {{has suggested}} that {{if it had been}} Connery in the leading role instead of Lazenby, On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have epitomised the series. On the other hand, Danny Peary wrote, [...] "I'm not sure I agree with those who insist that if Connery had played Bond it would definitely be the best of the entire Bond series... Connery's Bond, with his boundless humor and sense of fun and self-confidence, would be out of place in this picture. It actually works better with Lazenby because he is incapable of playing Bond as a bigger-than-life hero; for one thing he hasn't the looks... Lazenby's Bond also hasn't the assurance of Connery's Bond and that is appropriate in the crumbling, depressing world he finds himself. He seems vulnerable and jittery at times. At the skating rink, he is actually scared. We worry about him... On Her Majesty's Secret Service doesn't have Connery and it's impossible to ever fully adjust to Lazenby, but I think that it <b>still</b> <b>might</b> be the best Bond film, as many Bond cultists claim." [...] Peary also described On Her Majesty's Secret Service as [...] "the most serious", [...] "the most cynical" [...] and [...] "the most tragic" [...] of the Bond films.|$|E

2500|$|Roman historians record cautionary {{tales of}} {{officers}} who abuse their authority to coerce sex from their soldiers, and then suffer dire consequences. The youngest officers, who <b>still</b> <b>might</b> retain {{some of the}} adolescent attraction that Romans favored in male-male relations, were advised to beef up their masculine qualities by not wearing perfume, nor trimming nostril and underarm hair. An incident related by Plutarch in his biography of Marius illustrates the soldier's right to maintain his sexual integrity despite pressure from his superiors. A good-looking young recruit named Trebonius had been sexually harassed {{over a period of}} time by his superior officer, who happened to be Marius's nephew, Gaius Luscius. One night, having fended off unwanted advances on numerous occasions, Trebonius was summoned to Luscius's tent. Unable to disobey the command of his superior, he found himself the object of a sexual assault and drew his sword, killing Luscius. A conviction for killing an officer typically resulted in execution. When brought to trial, he was able to produce witnesses to show that he had repeatedly had to fend off Luscius, and [...] "had never prostituted his body to anyone, despite offers of expensive gifts". Marius not only acquitted Trebonius in the killing of his kinsman, but gave him a crown for bravery.|$|E
2500|$|Other critics {{gave the}} {{collection}} either mixed or negative reviews. For n+1, Chad Harbach wrote that [...] "apart from 'The Suffering Channel' and 'Good Old Neon', Oblivion has a casual feel." [...] Harbach argued that [...] "compared to the premeditated formal performances of Brief Interviews with Hideous Men, his previous collection, much of Oblivion has a loose, tossed-off feel." [...] For the London Review of Books, Wyatt Mason wrote {{that although the}} stories were [...] "a bright array of sad and moving and funny and fascinating human objects of undeniable, unusual value," [...] they <b>still</b> <b>might</b> exhibit a [...] "fundamental rhetorical failure" [...] due to their difficulty. Nonetheless, Mason claimed Wallace's collection to be [...] "the most interesting and serious and accomplished shorter fiction published in the past decade." [...] For The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani suggested that the collection was dominated by [...] "tiresome, whiny passages." [...] She wrote that even though Wallace is a [...] "prose magician," [...] in Oblivion he [...] "gives us only the tiniest tasting of his smorgasbord of talents. Instead, he all too often settles {{for the sort of}} self-indulgent prattling that bogged down his 1999 collection, Brief Interviews with Hideous Men, and the cheap brand of irony and ridicule that he once denounced in an essay as 'agents of a great despair and stasis in U.S. culture.'" [...] James Wood also disliked the collection in his review for The New Republic. He claimed that the story [...] "Mister Squishy" [...] was [...] "fundamentally unreadable" [...] because Wallace too often [...] "bloats his sentences with mimesis." [...] "Above all," [...] wrote Wood, [...] "his immersionist's willingness to saturate his fictions in the germs that he is documenting makes them sick themselves." [...] The collection as a whole, according to Wood, was [...] "talented, frustrating, and finally intolerable"; each of the stories failed to [...] "move the reader" [...] because they [...] "strangely reproduce the extreme coldness that they abhor." ...|$|E
