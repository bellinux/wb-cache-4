5|$|Pleydell's father, William, {{had been}} given a 95-year lease of the Midgehall estate in Lydiard Tregoze by the Abbott of Stanley Abbey in 1534. A 1545 record, {{ordering}} Gabriel to pay 26 shillings and 8 pence in benevolence to the crown under King Henry VIII, indicates that he was soon managing Midgehall's financial affairs. His father entrusted him in 1549 with tenancy of the manor house at West Ilsley, Berkshire and in September 1553 a <b>sublease</b> of the Midgehall estate. William died in 1555, leaving Midgehall's full lease to his wife, Agnes. When she died in 1567, Gabriel unsuccessfully challenged his mother's will (an action which estranged his younger brother, John) despite inheriting tenancy of the estate. Pleydell's father originally intended two of his elder sons—Virgil and Tobias—to succeed ownership before Gabriel. Virgil died around 1559 and by 1567 Tobias had been resident in Chipping Faringdon for 11 years, prompting him to relinquish his inheritance.|$|E
5|$|The {{new owners}} oversaw the {{construction}} of a ten-storey expansion to the property. This added a further 200 rooms to the lodge, for which permission was given although the Nevada State Park Advisory Committee opposed the move. They sought to re-open the Cal Neva on July 1, 1969, but instead it partly opened in May of that year with the new expansion opening the following month. The Ohio Real Estate Investment Trust purchased the lodge in 1970 for $6 million, with the aim to lease it to the U.S. Capital Corporation, who in turn sought to <b>sublease</b> it to Tahoe Crystal Bay Inc. The stockholders of the Ohio Real Estate Investment Trust filed a lawsuit against the company in 1973, which resulted in the Cal Neva being placed into federal receivership. After opening year round since Sinatra purchased the lodge, it closed for the winter season in 1974 due to a drop in visitors blamed on the 1973 oil crisis.|$|E

The top floor was to be occupied by Muvico Theaters, however they pulled out in 2009. The David Barton Gym, the first and largest tenant of the Block 37 project, has {{pulled out of the}} project favoring, instead, the Roosevelt Collection in the south loop. The reason the gym opted out was the delayed opening of the mall, which is scheduled for fall 2009 opening rather than fall 2008 as scheduled. In March 2009, Apple Inc. also withdrew from its leasing agreement, and less than a month later it signed an agreement to develop a new storefront in the Clybourn Corridor on property bounded by North Avenue, Halsted Street and Clybourn Avenue. After Apple backed out of its lease, Lululemon backed out of its lease to be located next to Apple. Other March 2009 tenant signings included Chicago's haberdashery Bigsby & Kruthers, Sunglass Hut, crystal jewelers Swarovski, Starfruit Cafe, and Fast-casual eatery Tahini. Also, in the face of declining advertising revenue, CBS sought to <b>sublease</b> part of its studio. A Loews Hotel will be built in forthcoming years.|$|E

25|$|For {{his playing}} company, Farrant {{combined}} his Windsor {{children with the}} Children of the Chapel Royal, then directed by William Hunnis. On Farrant's death in 1580, Hunnis took on John Newman as a partner and they subleased the property from Farrant's widow, putting up a ₤100 bond on the promise to promptly pay the rent and to make needed repairs. But the venture did not go well financially, which put Farrant's widow in jeopardy of defaulting on the rent to More. In November 1583, Farrant brought suit against Hunnis and Newman for default on the bond. To escape a suit by her or More, Hunnis and Newman transferred their <b>sublease</b> to Henry Evans, a Welsh scrivener and theatrical affectionado. This unauthorised assignment of the <b>sublease</b> gave More an excuse to bring suit to retake possession of the property, but Evans used legal delays and finally escaped legal action by selling the <b>sublease</b> to Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, sometime after Michaelmas Term (November) of 1583, who then gave it to his secretary, the writer John Lyly.|$|E

40|$|Policies {{pertaining}} to three basic problems in land leasing practices are examined(1) to compare income from leases on state school lands with income from leases of similar privately owned land, (2) to identify policies regarding {{the disposition of}} conflicting bids on state school land, and (3) to identify policies regarding <b>subleasing</b> school lands {{and its impact on}} school funds. It was found that on dry and grazing land, cash rentals on school lands compare favorably with the rentals on private land. The greatest differences in rental rates appear in the area of irrigated farming, where the private land rental rate was considerably higher than the public school land rate. On the basis of information obtained in this study, the State Board of Land Commissioners has been exercising prudent judgement when resolving the conflict bid. The policies concerning <b>subleasing</b> practices have been defined and delineated much more clearly since 1965, although the current <b>subleasing</b> is difficult to zontrol. (NI...|$|R

25|$|Until 2014, Delta served Love Field by subleasing use of American's gates. After being {{notified}} that {{it would}} have to cease service at Love, Delta threatened to sue the city of Dallas. Southwest agreed to a temporary resolution of the situation by agreeing to <b>sublease</b> gate space to Delta until January 2015. When this agreement expired, United Airlines agreed to allow Delta to use one of its gates until July 2015. United had previously agreed to transfer its gate rights to Southwest. The city of Dallas brought a lawsuit in federal court in June 2015 in order to resolve Delta's claims. In January 2016, Delta won a preliminary injunction to continue service at Love Field using Southwest gate rights, based on federal aviation law and DOT competition policies. As of June 2016, the injunction is being appealed at the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.|$|E

Furthermore, he added that Paramount was responsible for creating one between the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012, and he was trying to locate it, noting the difficulties related to obtaining the print as the studio no longer possesses an adequate capacity to deal with this matter and off-shore companies involved in the legal matters were now greatly reduced in staff and stated that is the reason why acquiring the film's print is a time-consuming process.|$|E
