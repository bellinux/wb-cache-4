Young reports to Col.

40|$|This role-play {{focuses on}} the {{dilemmas}} in balancing regulatory requirements, personal relationships and a natural reluctance to “cause trouble. ” These dilemmas arise in many settings, and can be particularly acute in laboratories that handle hazardous substances because of the serious safety implications of violations. In addition, violations can carry fines and penalties for laboratories and universities where they occur. The worries of the graduate student in the role-play about potential laboratory shut-downs and corresponding research delays are all too real. Specifics of regulations {{vary according to the}} materials being handled. The underlying principles regarding human and environmental <b>safety</b> <b>stay</b> the same. In the role-play scenario, a graduate student is seeking advice from a fellow graduate student about how to balance concerns about personal safety — their own and that of others in the lab — regulatory consequences and the potential damage to relationships by asking questions about potential violations. What is the student’s responsibility to discover whether there are violations? What are the consequences for avoiding knowledge? How should those competing concerns be balanced? The two students seem to be moving toward the conclusion that the safety issues are serious enough that some action must be taken. At this point, the issue becomes how to raise the issue professionally and in a way that minimizes hard feelings or anger with the student who raises the concerns. To avoid a “shoot the messenger” situation, the discussion should focus on constructive and effective ways to have a conversation with the disorganized adviser about the potential safety problems in the lab...|$|E

50|$|This was {{the cause}} of the Gettysburg Railroad firebox {{explosion}} near Gardners, Pennsylvania in 1995, where low water allowed the front of the crown sheet to overheat until the regular crown stays pulled through the sheet, releasing the a great deal of steam and water under full boiler pressure into the firebox.

40|$|As {{more and}} more {{infectious}} agents become targets for immunization programmes, the spectrum of adverse events linked to vaccines has been widening. Although some of these links are tenuous, relatively {{little is known about}} the immunopathogenesis of even the best characterized vaccine-associated adverse events (VAAEs). The range of possible use of active immunization is rapidly expanding to include vaccines against infectious diseases that require cellular responses to provide protection (e. g. tuberculosis, herpes viral infections), therapeutic vaccines for chronic infections (e. g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, viral hepatitis B and C), and vaccines against non-infectious conditions (e. g. cancer, autoimmune diseases). Less virulent pathogens (e. g. varicella, rotavirus in the developed world) are also beginning to be targeted, and vaccine use is being justified in terms of societal and parental "costs" rather than in straightforward morbidity and mortality costs. In the developed world the paediatric immunization schedule is becoming crowded, with pressure to administer increasing numbers of antigens simultaneously in ever simpler forms (e. g. subcomponent, peptide, and DNA vaccines). This trend, while attractive in many ways, brings hypothetical risks (e. g. genetic restriction, narrowed shield of protection, and loss of randomness), which will need to be evaluated and monitored. The available epidemiological and laboratory tools to address the issues outlined above are somewhat limited. As immunological and genetic tools improve in the years ahead, it is likely that we shall be able to explain the immunopathogenesis of many VAAEs and perhaps even anticipate and avoid some of them. However, this will only happen if the human and financial resources needed for monitoring and studying vaccine <b>safety</b> <b>stay</b> in step with the accelerating pace of vaccine development.

He also added a half-timbered block adjoining the curtain wall, which was used as the castle's kitchens and stables. Henry VII visited it during Wyatt's tenure.

5000|$|According to John J. Marshall, Of the {{childhood}} and upbringing {{of the famous}} outlaw we have no reliable account, but a very rare pamphlet on {{the life and death}} of Redmond O'Hanlon, dated 1st August 1681 and published in Dublin, 1682, states that [...] "Redmond, son of Loghlin O'Hanlon, was born near Poyntzpass in the County of Armagh in the year 1640," [...] but some of the later lives say he was born at the foot of Slieve Gullion, and local tradition confirms this. [...] "It was his good fortune to be educated in an English school where he attained to such a perfection in that language that it might have proved a great advantage to him in after life." [...] His linguistic accomplishments certainly did prove useful to him in afterlife. He is represented as a most accomplished gentleman, equal to Ossory, who was accounted for manners and bearing the finest cavalier since Sir Philip Sidney. He was also an excellent actor and mimic, able to personate a King's officer, merchant or countryman, as the exigencies of the case required. In one of the contemporary pamphlets there is given what is most evidently a fictitious account of his youth and early days in which he is represented as a being a footman for Sir George Acheson of Markethill, and while in the gentleman's employment practicing himself in all the accounts of roguery. Cosgrave's account seems quite probable, when he says - [...] "Redmond once happened to be at the killing of a gentleman in a quarrel, and flying for <b>safety,</b> <b>stayed</b> abroad for a long time, still refusing to come to a trial, till he was outlawed, which put him into his shifts." [...] It is likely that O'Hanlon fled to France and there joined the Army where he acquired which he so often turned to good use in his after career, and also was able to speak French like a native, Gaelic and English being equally at his command.|$|R
50|$|Pedro Diniz was {{involved}} in two major incidents during the race.

Diniz managed to continue and made a pit stop as the safety car was preparing to pull in - only to retire when he came back onto the circuit and his Ligier burst into flames, because a safety-valve in the fuel tank had jammed open, with the <b>safety</b> car <b>staying</b> out for three extra laps as a result.|$|R
