40|$|We {{develop a}} model of dust {{evolution}} in a multiphase, inhomogeneous ISM including dust growth and destruction processes. The physical conditions for grain evolution are taken from hydrodynamical simulations of giant molecular clouds in a Milky Way-like spiral galaxy. We improve the treatment of dust growth by accretion in the ISM to investigate {{the role of the}} temperature-dependent sticking coefficient and ion-grain interactions. From detailed observational data on the gas-phase Si abundances [Si/H]_{gas} measured in the local Galaxy, we derive a relation between the average [Si/H]_{gas} and the local gas density n(H) which we use as a critical constraint for the models. This relation requires a sticking coefficient that decreases with the gas temperature. The <b>synthetic</b> <b>relation</b> constructed from the spatial dust distribution reproduces the slope of - 0. 5 of the observed relation in cold clouds. This slope is steeper than that for the warm medium and is explained by the dust growth. We find that it occurs for all adopted values of the minimum grain size a_{min} from 1 to 5 nm. For the classical cut-off of a_{min}= 5 nm, the ion-grain interactions result in longer growth timescales and higher [Si/H]_{gas} than the observed values. For a_{min} below 3 nm, the ion-grain interactions enhance the growth rates, steepen the slope of [Si/H]_{gas}-n(H) relation and provide a better match to observations. The rates of dust re-formation in the ISM by far exceed the rates of dust production by stellar sources as expected from simple evolution models. After the cycle of matter in and out of dust reaches a steady state, the dust growth balances the destruction operating on similar timescales of 350 Myr.

40|$|Abstract. Explanation and argumentation are {{fundamental}} to reasoning. They are therefore of some importance to artificial intelligence. Discourse-based reasoning (DBR) is a knowledge representation technology that uses natural patterns of discourse {{as a basis}} for a structural ontology of explanatory and argumentative reasoning. By this means, we may ontologize the reasoning process itself, thus rendering it accessible as an explanatory mechanism. Towards this objective, this paper introduces three general categories of rhetorical <b>relations,</b> including inferential, <b>synthetic,</b> and multinuclear. Inferential relations are argumentative, causal, or conditional; <b>synthetic</b> <b>relations</b> are purely explanatory; and multinuclear relations are used to express rhetorically bound pluralities of concept instantiations. These categories are used to explore design-time and runtime dimensions for representing linked and convergent structures. Using discourse-based reasoning, human and artificial agents will engage in collaborative reasoning, discover knowledge, resolve conflict, and render explanations using rhetorically explicit representations. ...|$|R

We use new stellar and pulsation models to build a homogeneous and consistent framework to derive the Cepheid features. The Cepheid populations expected in synthetic color-magnitude diagrams of young stellar systems (from 20 Myr to 250 Myr) are computed in several photometric bands for Y = 0. 25 and Y = 0. 35, at a fixed metallicity (Z = 0. 008). The PLRs appear to be very similar in the two cases, with negligible effects (few %) on distances, while PWRs differ somewhat, with systematic uncertainties in deriving distances as high as about 7 % at log P < 1. 5. Statistical effects due to the number of variables used to determine the relations contribute to a distance systematic error of the order of few percent, with values decreasing from optical to near-infrared bands.

40|$|Classical Cepheids are primary {{distance}} indicators {{playing a}} fundamental {{role in the}} calibration of the extragalactic distance scale. The possible dependence of their characteristic period-luminosity (PL) relation on chemical composition is still debated in the literature, and the behavior of these pulsators at very low metallicity regimes is almost unexplored. In order to derive constraints on the application of the PL relation at low metal abundances, we investigate the properties of the few ultra-low metallicity (Z approximate to 0. 0004) Cepheids recently discovered in the Blue Compact Dwarf galaxy IZw 18. To this purpose, we have computed an updated and extended set of nonlinear convective models for Z = 0. 0004 and Y = 0. 24, spanning a wide range of stellar masses, and taking into account the evolutionary constraints for selected luminosity levels. As a result, we are able to predict the topology of the instability strip, the variations of all the relevant quantities along the pulsation cycle, including the morphology of the light curves, the theoretical period-luminosity-color, period-Wesenheit, and PL relations at such a low metallicity. For each of these relations, we provide the appropriate coefficients for fundamental mode pulsators with Z = 0. 0004. By comparing these results with the properties of more metal-rich Cepheids, we find that the <b>synthetic</b> PL <b>relations</b> for Z = 0. 0004 are steeper than at higher Z, but similar to the Z = 0. 004 ones, thus suggesting a leveling off of the metallicity effect toward the lowest Zs...|$|R

Somatostatin was first described in 1973 by Brazeau et al. [16]. The same communication reported the bioactivity of a synthetic replicate. From the industrial point of view, researchers advanced the development of analogs quite soon after the discovery of somatostatin. The initial work was based on peptide chemistry by which the SST sequences related to peptide binding were identified [17 – 19].

Meanwhile, radial velocity surveys discover also very low-mass planets. Uniting all this observational data into one coherent picture to better understand planet formation is an important, but difficult undertaking. Our approach is to develop a model which can make testable predictions for all these observational methods. We continue to describe how we have extended our formation model into a self-consistently coupled formation and evolution model. We show how we calculate the internal structure of the solid core and radiogenic heating. We also improve the protoplanetary disk model. Finally, we conduct population synthesis calculations. We present how the planetary mass-radius relationship of planets with primordial H/He envelopes forms and evolves in time. The basic shape of the M-R relation can be understood from the core accretion model. Low-mass planets cannot bind massive envelopes, while super-critical cores necessarily trigger runway gas accretion, leading to "forbidden" zones in the M-R plane. For a given mass, there is a considerable diversity of radii. We compare the <b>synthetic</b> M-R <b>relation</b> with the observed one, finding good agreement for a> 0. 1 AU. The synthetic radius distribution is characterized by a strong increase towards small R, and a second, lower local maximum at ~ 1 Jovian radius. The increase towards small radii reflects the increase of the mass function towards low M. The second local maximum {{is due to the fact}} that radii are nearly independent of mass for giant planets. A comparison of the synthetic radius distribution with Kepler data shows agreement for R> 2 Earth radii, but divergence for smaller radii. We predict that in the next few years, Kepler should find the second, local maximum at ~ 1 Jovian radius. Comment: Accepted to A&A. Minor revisions only relative to v...|$|R

We study whether the E_ p - E_ iso correlation can be reproduced if internal shocks are indeed responsible for the prompt emission, or conversely, if the correlation can be used to constrain the internal shock scenario. We developed a toy model where internal shocks are limited to the collision of only two shells. Synthetic burst populations were constructed for various distributions of the model parameters, such as the injected power in the relativistic outflow, the average Lorentz factor, and its typical contrast between the shells.

A satisfactory agreement between model and data can often be achieved, but only if several strong constraints are satisfied on both the dynamics of the flow and the microphysics that governs the redistribution of the shock-dissipated energy.

We found that there is a difference in P-L relations as a function of phase between the Cepheids in each of the Clouds; the most likely cause for this is the metallicity difference between the two galaxies. We also investigated the dispersion of the multi-phase P-L relations, and found that the minimum dispersion do not differ significantly from the mean light P-L dispersion.

40|$|The main {{thrust of}} the {{argument}} of this thesis is to show the possibility of articulating a method of construction or of synthesis [...] as against the most common method of analysis or division [...] which has always been (so we shall argue) a necessary component of scientific theorization. This method will {{be shown to be}} based on a fundamental <b>synthetic</b> logical <b>relation</b> of thought, that we shall call inversion [...] to be understood as a species of logical opposition, and as one of the basic monadic logical operators. Thus the major objective of this thesis is to This thesis {{can be viewed as a}} response to Larry Laudan's challenge, which is based on the claim that ``the case has yet to be made that the rules governing the techniques whereby theories are invented (if any such rules there be) are the sorts of things that philosophers should claim any interest in or competence at. '' The challenge itself would be to show that the logic of discovery (if at all formulatable) performs the epistemological role of the justification of scientific theories. We propose to meet this challenge head on: a) by suggesting precisely how such a logic would be formulated; b) by demonstrating its epistemological relevance (in the context of justification) and c) by showing that a) and b) can be carried out without sacrificing the fallibilist view of scientific knowledge. OBJECTIVES: We have set three successive objectives: one general, one specific, and one sub-specific, each one related to the other in that very order. (A) The general objective is to indicate the clear possibility of renovating the traditional analytico-synthetic epistemology. By realizing this objective, we attempt to widen the scope of scientific reason or rationality, which for some time now has perniciously been dominated by pure analytic reason alone. In order to achieve this end we need to show specifically that there exists the possibility of articulating a synthetic (constructive) logic/reason, which has been considered by most mainstream thinkers either as not articulatable, or simply non-existent. (B) The second (specific) task is to respond to the challenge of Larry Laudan by demonstrating the possibility of an epistemologically significant generativism. In this context we will argue that this generativism, which is our suggested alternative, and the simplified structuralist and semantic view of scientific theories, mutually reinforce each other to form a single coherent foundation for the renovated analytico-synthetic methodological framework. (C) The third (sub-specific) objective, accordingly, is to show the possibility of articulating a synthetic logic that could guide us in understanding the process of theorization. This is realized by proposing the foundations for developing a logic of inversion, which represents the pattern of synthetic reason in the process of constructing scientific definitions...|$|R

TITLE Spatial generalizations of the {{properties}} of the triangle AUTHOR Jirˇı' Sřubarˇ SUPERVISOR Prof. RNDr. Adolf Karger, DrSc. DEPARTMENT Department of mathematics education ABSTRACT The present thesis describes various interesting properties of a triangle. The aim is to find and prove similar properties of its spatial generalization - a tetrahedron. Even though both synthetic and computational methods are used for proving spatial <b>relations,</b> <b>synthetic</b> approach is preferred whenever possible. The thesis is divided into two parts. In the first part, {{the properties}} of the tetrahedron analogous to the centroid and the orthocenter of the triangle are described. Also, conditions on the existence of the orthocenter of the tetrahedron are derived. Moreover, for tetrahedrons without an orthocenter, the so-called Monge point is introduced as its generalization. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, some further properties of the triangle are studied - - the Simson line, the de Longchamps point, the nine-point circle, the Euler line, the Lemoine point, the isodynamic points, the Lemoine axis and the Brocard axis. As the main contribution of the present thesis we define and prove the existence of spatial analogues of the above mentioned properties for the tetrahedron - the de Longchamps point, the twelve-point and [...] .

40|$|O texto tem o fito de dialogar criticamente com o texto Revisitando o conceito de cidadania: notas para uma educação politécnica, de Adriana Gleisler, que procura "recolocar a questão do significado da cidadania hoje", na perspectiva de "identificar a que conceito de cidadania a noção de politecnia se filia". Nesse sentido, o presente texto, organizado em três momentos, pretende oferecer uma visão alternativa àquela posta pela autora. Na seção, Qual cidadania, em qual democracia, discutimos sumariamente os conceitos de cidadania e democracia, articulando-os aos respectivos contextos da chamada redemocratização e do governo Lula. Procuramos, com isso, revelar a opção política das forças que trabalharam pela 'transição democrática', atualizadas — de certa forma — no atual governo. Em Qual educação politécnica, retomamos o conceito de educação politécnica e, a partir dele, tentamos mostrar como a opção política de cariz aliancista acabou por arrefecer o ímpeto socialista, desarmando o discurso educacional crítico de sua mais importante base: a luta pela superação da sociedade de classes. Finalmente, em As duas faces de uma miragem, procuramos (re) apresentar de forma sintética a relação de subordinação política tanto no aspecto mais geral, quanto no aspecto do debate educacional.

In this sense, this text, organized in three moments, intends to offer an alternative view to the one posed by the author. In the section, Which citizenship, in which democracy, we briefly discuss the concepts of citizenship and democracy, articulating them to the respective contexts of the so-called redemocratization and the Lula government. We seek, with this, to reveal the political option of the forces that work for the 'democratic transition' updated — in a certain manner — in the current government. In Which polytechnic education, we retake the concept of polytechnic education and, from it, we try to show how the political option of the alliancist countenance ended up cooling the socialist impetus, disarming the critical educational speech of its most important base: the fight for the overcoming of the class society. Finally, in The two faces of a mirage, we seek to present (once again) in a <b>synthetic</b> manner, the <b>relation</b> of political subordination both in the more general aspect and in the educational debate aspect...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} and to process the current literary knowledge of the physico-chemical properties of vegetable oil raw used for biodiesel production in terms of its qualitative stability. An object of investigation was oxidative stability of biodiesel. In the study, we focused on the qualitative physico-chemical properties of vegetable oils used for biodiesel production, oxidative degradation and its mechanisms, oxidation of lipids, mechanisms of autooxidation, effectivennes of different <b>synthetic</b> antioxidants in <b>relation</b> to oxidative stability of biodiesel and methods of oxidative stability determination. Knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of vegetable oil as raw material and the factors affecting these properties is critical for the production of quality biodiesel and its sustainability. According to the source of oilseed, variations in the chemical composition of the vegetable oil are expressed by variations in the molar ratio among different fatty acids in the structure. The relative ratio of fatty acids present in the raw material is kept relatively constant after the transesterification reaction. The quality of biodiesel physico-chemical properties is influenced by the chain length and the level of unsaturation of the produced fatty acid alkyl esters. A biodiesel is thermodynamically stable. Its instability primarily occurs from contact of oxygen present in the ambient air that is referred to as oxidative instability. For biodiesel is oxidation stability a general term. It is necessary to distinguish ‘storage stability' and ‘thermal stability', in relation to oxidative degradation, which may occur during extended periods of storage, transportation and end use. Fuel instability problems can be of two related types, short-term oxidative instability and long-term storage instability. Storage instability is defined in terms of solid formation, which can plug nozzles, filters, and degrade engine performance. Biodiesels are more susceptible to degradation compared to fossil diesel because of the presence of unsaturated fatty acid chain in it. The mechanisms of oxidative degradation are autoxidation in presence of atmospheric oxygen; thermal or thermal-oxidative degradation from excess heat; hydrolysis in presence of moisture or water during storage and in fuel lines; and microbial contamination from contact with dust particles or water droplets containing fungi or bacteria into the fuel. The oxidation of lipids is a complex process in which unsaturated fatty acids are reacted with molecular oxygen by means of free radicals. The radicals react with lipids, and cause oxidative destruction of unsaturated, polyunsaturated fatty acids, therefore, known as lipid peroxidation. The factors such as heat, oxygen, light, and some metal ions, especially iron and copper, also play a significant role in creating oxidation. Oxidative products formed in biodiesel affect fuel storage life, contribute to deposit formation in tanks, and they may cause clogging of fuel filters and injection systems. The volatile organic acids formed as secondary by products of the oxidative degradation, may stimulate corrosion in the fuel system. Poor stability can lead to increasing acid numbers, increasing fuel viscosity, and the formation of gums and sediments. In general, antioxidants can prevent oxidation. Biodiesel, because it contains large numbers of molecules with double bonds, is much less oxidatively stable than petroleum-based diesel fuel. Oxidation stability is the important parameter to determine the storage of biodiesel for longer period of time. Biodiesel samples were evaluated according to methods on the base of kept in contact with pure oxygen at elevated temperatures and pressures. The results show that the performance antioxidants variation is observed for biodiesel. The most commonly used primary synthetic antioxidants<! [...] [endif] [...] ...|$|R
