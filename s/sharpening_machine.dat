40|$|A {{study on}} noise {{pollution}} in selected sawmills (Mile 3, Mile 1 and Rumuosi sawmills) in Port Harcourt was carried out. Physical {{measurements of the}} noise levels of sawmill machines, including Table Saw, Planing Machine,Stenner 48 Bandsaw, and <b>Sharpening</b> <b>Machine,</b> were made using a digital sound level meter. The background noise of the sawmills ranged 70. 58 – 79. 70 dBA {{in the order of}} Mile 3 > Mile 1 >Rumuosi. The average noise level of sawmill machines for Mile 3, Mile 1 and Rumuosi ranged 89. 76 ± 0. 09 - 100. 49 ± 0. 20 dBA, 89. 81 ± 0. 13 - 97. 00 ± 0. 46 dBA and 89. 76 ± 0. 07 - 100. 10 ± 0. 53 dBA, respectively. In the three sawmills studied, the <b>Sharpening</b> <b>machine</b> recorded the least noise levelwhile the Planing machine had the highest. The noise dose (D) of the <b>Sharpening</b> <b>machine</b> at the three sawmills ranged 0. 97 - 0. 98, which is below the permissible limit of 1, while the D for Table Saw, Planing Machine and Stenner 48 Bandsawranged 1. 86 - 4. 27, which is in excess of 1. From the measured noise level and the estimated D, an empirical model that could predict the recommended time a worker is supposed to work with the identified sawmill machines was developed {{for each of the three}} sawmills. The values obtained for the hearing deterioration indexindicate that the risk of developing hearing loss after 35 years of exposure is likely to be in the order of Planing machine > Table saw >Stenner 48 bandsaw > <b>Sharpening</b> <b>machine.</b> It is concluded that there is noise pollution emanating from these sawmill machines...|$|E
40|$|Broaching is a {{metal-cutting}} {{production method}} using a multi-toothed tool, the geometrically defined cutting edges of which lie one {{behind the other}} and are graduated by one cutting thickness each time. Broach sharpening machines are used to keep the geometrical accuracy and cutting quality of broaching tools at a constantly high level throughout the entire service life of a broaching tool. A coordinate transformation algorithm for a broach <b>sharpening</b> <b>machine</b> with parallel kinematics is developed and implemented in a Sinumerik 840 D pl as OEM NCK application. A method to overcome mechanical singularities is included...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a new method {{to evaluate the}} geometry of dull cutting tools in order to verify the necessity of tool re-sharpening and to decrease the tool grinding machine setup time, based on a laser scanning approach. The developed method consists {{of the definition of}} a system architecture and the programming of all the algorithms needed to analyze the data and provide, as output, the cutting angles of the worn tool. These angles are usually difficult to be measured and are needed to set up the grinding machine. The main challenges that have been dealt with in this application are related to the treatment of data acquired by the system’s cameras, which must be specific for the milling tools, usually characterized by the presence of undercuts and sharp edges. Starting from the architecture of the system, an industrial product has been designed, with the support of a grinding machine manufacturer. The basic idea has been to develop a low-cost system that could be integrated on a tool <b>sharpening</b> <b>machine</b> and interfaced with its numeric control. The article reports the developed algorithms and an example of application...|$|E

On the basis of these analysis and finding out of possible lacks will be recommended solution, which help to reduction of incidence anticoincident products...|$|R
5000|$|Johnston {{was still}} {{the owner of the}} Mount Molloy sawmill when it burnt down on 31 January 1934, William J Santowski being the manager at the time. It was {{reported}} that [...] "One 350 h.p. boiler was in the destroyed building, also one Sandycroft steam engine; one twin circular log breaking down plant, four saw benches, one planing machine, saw-dust carriers, belting, shafting and pulleys and other tools of various descriptions, 29 circular saws, one log rolling winch, two saw <b>sharpening</b> <b>machines,</b> three cross-cut sawing machines". However, the employees were able to protect the boiler, main engines and pumping plant from serious damage. There were also two other planing machines in a separate building that was not destroyed. Prior to the fire Johnston had purchased machinery for a new sawmill at Shipton's Flat near Cooktown, and after the fire he placed some of the machinery at Mount Molloy. He claimed that the latter was a paying proposition and a very essential part of his organisation. It was also essential to have the mill at Mount Molloy, as most hardwood supplies came from there.|$|R
60|$|We went {{together}} {{down to the}} fields, he to mow {{the island}} of grass he had left standing the previous evening, I to <b>sharpen</b> the <b>machine</b> knife, to mow out the hedge-bottoms with the scythe, and to rake the swaths from {{the way of the}} machine when the unmown grass was reduced to a triangle. The cool, moist fragrance of the morning, the intentional stillness of everything, of the tall bluish trees, of the wet, frank flowers, of the trustful moths folded and unfolded in the fallen swaths, was a perfect medium of sympathy. The horses moved with a still dignity, obeying his commands. When they were harnessed, and the machine oiled, still he was loth to mar the perfect morning, but stood looking down the valley.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{grinding}} wheel-profile {{is mostly}} formed {{by adjusting the}} angle of cylindrical profile model when regrinding gear hob with the large helix flute. Repeat trial cutting is needed with this method, which results in low efficiency. In order to improve the efficiency of processing, a mathematical model of grinding wheel profile was establish in according to forming principle of the rake face of gear hob and accurately calculate grinding wheel-profile. A automatic programming system of calculating grinding wheel-profile and automatically generate NC code is developed with the developing tool of VC++. Introductions Although cutting-edge shape of hob is a straight line, {{it will lead to}} the shape of the rake face distort when straight generatrix grinding wheel is used to grind hob, therefore, the generatrix of grinding wheel is a certain curve, not straight line[1]. The domestic grinding wheel-profile used by most of the <b>sharpening</b> grinder <b>machine</b> is mainly processed by adjusting the angle of cylindrical profil...|$|R
5000|$|Rag Mill in Slaughterford, {{also known}} as Overshot Mill. A mill leat, now filled in, ran for over three {{quarters}} of a kilometre from the sluices just downstream of the Doncombe Brook confluence to an overshot wheel in a fulling mill on this site. In the 1890s, rag processing machinery was installed at the mill, and the undershot wheel, which can still be seen on the derelict site dates from that time, being served by a much shorter leat from the next sluice upstream from the mill. Also clearly identifiable on the site is the remains of a rag boiler. The mill, demolished in 1964, processed rags into individual fibres or [...] "stuff", which was transported in vats of elm across the bridge to Chapps Mill for paper making. The water wheel power was supplemented by a gas engine, and ran shafts and pulleys to a cutting machine and conveyor belt, as well as a grindstone to <b>sharpen</b> the cutting <b>machine</b> blades.|$|R
5000|$|A {{very large}} number of low-quality {{reproduction}} katana and wakizashi are available; their prices usually range between $10 to about $200. These cheap blades are Japanese in shape only—they are usually machine made and <b>machine</b> <b>sharpened,</b> and minimally hardened or heat-treated. The hamon pattern (if any) on the blade is applied by scuffing, etching, or otherwise marking the surface, without any difference in hardness or temper of the edge. The metal used to make low-quality blades is mostly cheap stainless steel, and typically is much harder and more brittle than true katana. Finally, cheap reproduction Japanese swords usually have fancy designs on them since they are just for show. Better-quality reproduction katana typically range from $200 to about $1000 (though some can go easily above two thousand for quality production blades, folded and often traditionally constructed and with a proper polish [...] ), and high-quality or custom-made reproductions can go up to $15,000-$50,000. These blades are made to be used for cutting, and are usually heat-treated. High-quality reproductions made from carbon steel will often have a differential hardness or temper similar to traditionally made swords, and will show a hamon; they won't show a hada (grain), since they're not often made from folded steel.|$|R
