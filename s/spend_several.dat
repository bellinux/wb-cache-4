5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} {{lives on}} muddy and sandy bottoms, grazing on algae and detritus. It is gonochoristic and sexually dimorphic, depending on internal fertilization for spawning. Larvae {{of this species}} <b>spend</b> <b>several</b> days as plankton, undergoing a series of transformations until they reach complete metamorphosis. The maximum life span is 2 to 2.5 years. Predators of this snail include carnivorous gastropods such as cone snails and volutes. It is also a prey species for vertebrates including macaques, and also humans, who consume the soft parts {{in a wide variety}} of dishes.|$|E
5|$|Benioff and Weiss {{sometimes}} assign {{characters to}} particular writers; for example, Cogman {{was assigned to}} Arya Stark for the fourth season. The writers <b>spend</b> <b>several</b> weeks writing a character outline, including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes. After these individual outlines are complete, they spend another {{two to three weeks}} discussing each main character's individual arc and arranging them episode by episode. A detailed outline is created, with each of the writers working on a portion to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the fifth season, took {{a month and a half}} to complete both scripts. They are then read by Benioff and Weiss, who make notes, and parts of the script are rewritten. All ten episodes are written before filming begins, since they are filmed out of order with two units in different countries.|$|E
5|$|Heliade Rădulescu is {{considered}} one of the foremost champions of Romanian culture from the first half of the 19th century, having first risen to prominence through his association with Gheorghe Lazăr and his support of Lazăr's drive for discontinuing education in Greek. Over the following decades, he had a major role in shaping the modern Romanian language, but caused controversy when he advocated the massive introduction of Italian neologisms into the Romanian lexis. A Romantic nationalist landowner siding with moderate liberals, Heliade was among the leaders of the 1848 Wallachian revolution, after which he was forced to <b>spend</b> <b>several</b> years in exile. Adopting an original form of conservatism, which emphasized the role of the aristocratic boyars in Romanian history, he was rewarded for supporting the Ottoman Empire and clashed with the radical wing of the 1848 revolutionaries.|$|E

5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect and his eyes were colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to <b>spend</b> <b>several</b> minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E
5|$|Monica E. Geller is {{a fictional}} character, {{one of the}} six main {{characters}} who appeared in the American sitcom Friends. Created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and portrayed by actress Courteney Cox, Monica appears in each of the show's 236 episodes, from its premiere on September 24, 1994 to its finale on May 6, 2004. A chef known for her cleanliness, competitiveness and obsessive-compulsive nature, Monica is the younger sister of Ross and best friend of Rachel, the latter of whom she invites to live with her after Rachel forsakes her own wedding. The two characters <b>spend</b> <b>several</b> years living together as roommates until Monica begins a romantic relationship with long-time neighbor and friend Chandler, whom she marries. Unable to conceive children on their own, the couple eventually adopts twins and moves out of their apartment into a larger house in the suburbs.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, Sorabji ceased composing, {{because of}} his failing {{eyesight}} and difficulties in holding a pen. His health deteriorated severely in 1986, obliging him to abandon his home and <b>spend</b> <b>several</b> months in a Wareham hospital. In March 1987, together with his companion Reginald Norman Best (1909–1988), he moved into a two-room suite in Marley House Nursing Home, a private nursing home in Winfrith Newburgh, where he was permanently chairbound and received daily nursing care. In June 1988 he suffered a mild stroke, which left him slightly mentally impaired. He died of heart failure on 15 October 1988 at a little after 7pm, at the age of 96. He was cremated in Bournemouth Crematorium on 24 October of that year, and the funeral services took place in Corfe Castle Parish Church on the same day.|$|E

Jake agrees to give the money to Baby even though she says she can't tell him what it's for. Penny eventually accepts the money, but says there is another issue. Johnny and Penny perform a weekly dance at the Sheldrake, another nearby resort. Penny will miss her performance if she goes for the abortion, and they will forfeit their salary for the season. Billy suggests that Baby fill in for her. Johnny scoffs at this, which overcomes Baby's initial resistance. Billy and Penny insist that Johnny can teach anyone to dance. Johnny begins to teach Baby the mambo, and the two <b>spend</b> <b>several</b> awkward practice sessions together. Baby gradually begins to improve, and a romantic attraction grows between them.|$|E
5|$|As their {{relationship}} had become increasingly strained, {{his wife had}} left and returned to Britain. Although hoping to leave his post in India several months early, he was concerned for his economic prospects, and desperately searched for a new position. Through friends in the British archaeological community, he was offered a job as the Secretary of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down. Instead, he agreed {{to take up a}} chair in the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces at the Institute of Archaeology. In addition, the Pakistani Minister of Education invited him to become the Archaeological Adviser to the Pakistani government; he agreed to also take up this position, on the condition that he would only <b>spend</b> <b>several</b> months in the country each year over the next three.|$|E
5|$|By September 1889 Nielsen had progressed {{well enough}} on the violin to gain a {{position}} with the second violins in the prestigious Royal Danish Orchestra which played at Copenhagen's Royal Theatre, then conducted by Johan Svendsen. In this position he experienced Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres. Although this employment sometimes caused Nielsen considerable frustration, he continued to play there until 1905. After Svendsen's retirement in 1906, Nielsen increasingly served as conductor (being officially appointed assistant conductor in 1910). Between graduation and attaining this position, he made a modest income from private violin lessons while enjoying the continuing support of his patrons, not only Jens Georg Nielsen but also Albert Sachs (born 1846) and Hans Demant (1827–1897) who both ran factories in Odense. After {{less than a year}} at the Royal Theatre, Nielsen won a scholarship of 1,800 kroner, giving him the means to <b>spend</b> <b>several</b> months travelling in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Earl St Vincent was {{suffering}} from an extreme shortage of frigates, and on the arrival of Sensible at the Tagus immediately ordered the frigate to be commissioned as HMS Sensible, stripping six men from each of his ships to man her and turning the frigate into an active warship in just 12 hours. For a year Sensible remained with St. Vincent, until she {{was sent back to}} Britain in November 1799. On arrival the ship was downgraded from frontline service, but did <b>spend</b> <b>several</b> years commissioned as a military transport until wrecked off Ceylon on 3 March 1802. Among the treasures removed from the ship was a decorated brass cannon captured from the Ottomans in the seventeenth century and presented to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem by King Louis XIV of France, as well as a model of a galley made from gilt silver. These were sold, along with the other cargo and ships fittings at Sheerness in November 1799, the prize money shares subsequently awarded to the crew of Seahorse.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes the skis to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will <b>spend</b> <b>several</b> seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a different level of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), and it can be difficult for them to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Duperré's departure, a British {{squadron}} under Captain Henry Lambert {{consisting of}} HMS Magicienne, HMS Iphigenia and HMS Leopard arrived off Isle de France {{to restore the}} blockade. Rowley subsequently increased Lambert's forces, detaching Willoughby in Nereide with instructions to raid coastal anchorages on the island. On 24 April, Willoughby sighted the recently arrived Astrée, and on 30 April attacked the protected anchorage at Jacolet. His target was a large French merchant ship protected by two batteries and a detachment of regular infantry. Landing at night under heavy fire, Willoughby's men seized one battery, drove off a French attack on their beachhead and captured the second battery despite having to advance across a river, under fire, in broad daylight. On returning to their boats, Willoughby's men were attacked by a second French force which they also routed and drove {{more than a mile}} inland. Shortly afterwards however, Willoughby was seriously wounded when a musket he was firing exploded, shattering his jaw. As a result, he was forced to <b>spend</b> <b>several</b> months recovering from his injuries on Rodriguez.|$|E

Conrad {{questions}} her about {{her role in the}} Burger family and asks why she always did what she was told. Later Rosa leaves Conrad and moves into a flat on her own and works as a physiotherapist. In 1975 Rosa attends a party of a friend in Soweto, and it is there that she hears a black university student dismissing all whites' help as irrelevant, saying that whites cannot know what blacks want, and that blacks will liberate themselves. Despite being labelled a Communist and under surveillance by the authorities, Rosa manages to get a passport, and flies to Nice in France to <b>spend</b> <b>several</b> months with Katya, her father's first wife.
