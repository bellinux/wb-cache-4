5|$|The koala {{has several}} adaptations for its {{eucalypt}} diet, {{which is of}} low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in dietary fibre. The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be <b>snipped</b> at the petiole before being passed to the highly cusped molars, where they are shredded into small pieces. Koalas may also store food in their cheek pouches before it {{is ready to be}} chewed. The partially worn molars of middle-aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves into small particles, resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine, which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy. A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Measurements of inspiratory {{strength}} {{are critical}} for detecting inspiratory muscle weak-ness. Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (<b>SNIP)</b> is a quick, noninvasive measurement of global inspiratory strength; however, {{it is not clear}} how many trials are needed for reliable measurements. [Subjects and Methods] One hundred and nineteen subjects (age 39. 9 ± 16. 5, range 18 – 69 yrs) completed the study. They were divided into subgroups of different ages and gender. Subjects were asked to take 20 maximal sniffs after normal expiration, with 30 seconds rest in-between. The highest values among the first 10 and last 10 <b>SNIP</b> maneuvers were recorded as <b>SNIP</b> 1 - 10, and <b>SNIP</b> 11 - 20, respectively. The paired t-test was used to compare the differences. Two-way measures ANOVA was used to compare the effects of age and gender on <b>SNIP.</b> [Results] <b>SNIP</b> 11 – 20 was significantly greater than <b>SNIP</b> 1 – 10, suggesting that 10 trials is not enough to eliminate learning effects. Age did not affect <b>SNIP</b> in either gender, suggesting <b>SNIP</b> is preserved. In stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, the <b>SNIP</b> values were posi-tively related with body mass index in women and positively related with weight in men. [Conclusion] The results suggest that twenty trials are needed for reliable <b>SNIP</b> measurements. The mean value and lower limits of normal <b>SNIP</b> are provided for clinical comparison...|$|R
25|$|On the Corner (1972) was jazz trumpeter-composer Miles Davis's seminal {{foray into}} jazz-funk. Like his {{previous}} works though, On the Corner was experimental. Davis stated that On the Corner {{was an attempt}} at reconnecting with the young black audience which had largely forsaken jazz for rock and funk. While there is a discernible funk influence in the timbres of the instruments employed, other tonal and rhythmic textures, such as the Indian tambora and tablas, and Cuban congas and bongos, create a multi-layered soundscape. From a musical standpoint, the album was a culmination of sorts of the recording studio-based musique concrète approach that Davis and producer Teo Macero (who had studied with Otto Luening at Columbia University's Computer Music Center) had begun to explore in the late 1960s. Both sides of the record featured heavy funk drum and bass grooves, with the melodic parts <b>snipped</b> from hours of jams and mixed in the studio.|$|E

The sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (<b>SNIP)</b> and maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) are usually measured. We investigated whether the test yielding the best value at baseline continued to yield the best value during follow-up. Patients and method: We studied 25 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and 61 with myotonic muscular dystrophy (MMD). <b>SNIP</b> and MIP were measured at baseline then annually. Results: At baseline, <b>SNIP</b> was less than MIP in 20 DMD patients (80 %) and 32 MMD patients (52 %). During follow-up in DMD patients, changes in the best method always occurred from <b>SNIP</b> to MIP. In MMD patients, when <b>SNIP</b> was better than MIP at baseline, <b>SNIP</b> was usually better during follow-up (88 %), whereas better MIP than <b>SNIP</b> at baseline was frequently followed by shift to <b>SNIP</b> (50 %).

40|$|AbstractMeasurement of sniff nasal inspiratory {{pressure}} (<b>SNIP)</b> is {{now used}} widely as a simple, non-invasive assessment of global respiratory muscle strength, {{even though the}} technique evolved originally from measurements of trans-diaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) that reflect {{the status of the}} diaphragm. The relative participation of major respiratory muscles, apart from the diaphragm, in the generation of <b>SNIP</b> is not known. Therefore, we examined the activity during a sniff of both neck and abdominal “accessory” muscles. In seven young adults we implanted fine wire EMG electrodes under direct vision with high-resolution ultrasound into scalene, sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, and transversus abdominis. <b>SNIP</b> was measured during sniffs that were short and sharp, from low to maximal intensity, in both standing and supine postures. Mean maximum <b>SNIP</b> was − 105. 6 cmH 2 O (SD 32. 9) in supine and − 94. 5 cmH 2 O (26. 6) in the standing posture, (difference NS). In every subject, scalene activity appeared even at the lowest <b>SNIP,</b> and increased linearly with increasing <b>SNIP.</b> Sternomastoid activity appeared at higher <b>SNIP</b> levels in three of seven subjects. By contrast, trapezius activity was never present at low <b>SNIP,</b> and appeared in only 2 subjects at maximum <b>SNIP.</b> Sniff abdominal expiratory activity was inconsistent with no activity of transversus in four of seven subjects even at greatest <b>SNIP.</b> Thus, we observed differential activation among these non-diaphragm respiratory muscles during SNIP; while some accessory muscles were very active, others were unlikely to contribute to generation of <b>SNIP.</b> Clinically, this indicates <b>SNIP</b> will be impacted unequally by loss of function of specific respiratory muscles...|$|R

2500|$|In satire, Pope {{achieved}} two of {{the greatest}} poetic satires of all time in the Augustan period. [...] The Rape of the Lock (1712 and 1714) was a gentle mock-heroic. [...] Pope applies Virgil's heroic and epic structure {{to the story of}} a young woman (Arabella Fermor) having a lock of hair <b>snipped</b> by an amorous baron (Lord Petre). [...] The structure of the comparison forces Pope to invent mythological forces to overlook the struggle, and so he creates an epic battle, complete with a mythology of sylphs and metempsychosis, over a game of Ombre, leading to a fiendish appropriation of the lock of hair. [...] Finally, a deux ex machina appears and the lock of hair experiences an apotheosis.

2500|$|Compound-action <b>snips</b> {{are also}} known as {{aviation}} <b>snips</b> because they were developed to cut aluminum {{in the construction of}} aircraft. They can handle aluminium up to 18 gauge, mild steel up to 24 gauge or stainless steel up to 26 gauge.

[...] Straight cutting <b>snips</b> (generally have yellow colored soft grips) cut in a straight line and wide curves; left cutting <b>snips</b> (usually red) will cut straight and in a tight curve to the left; right cutting <b>snips</b> (usually green) will cut straight and in a tight curve to the right. These different cutting styles are necessary because metal is stiff and heavy and does not move out of the way readily when cutting around a curve. The respective styles move the material out of the way when cutting in the direction they are designed for. The blades are usually serrated to prevent material slippage.|$|R
