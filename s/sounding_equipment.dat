40|$|Abstract-Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) {{radio channel}} {{sounders}} commonly employ time-division multiplexing (TDM) techniques to switch between {{the elements of}} the transmit and receive antenna arrays. However, phase noise of the local oscillators in the transmitter and the receiver of a TDM MIMO channel sounder can significantly affect the accuracy of estimates of relevant channel parameters, such as the channel capacity and the parameters of propagation paths. In this paper we derive a new SAGE algorithm for path parameter estimation that compensates for the effect of phase noise. Monte Carlo simulations show that the new algorithm always outperforms the traditional SAGE algorithm [21, 131 and that it is able to practically mitigate this effect, provided the phase noise variance is below a certain threshold. The general conclusion is that the new SAGE algorithm is able to compensate for the effect of phase noise in practical channel <b>sounding</b> <b>equipments,</b> provided the used sounding sequences are sufficiently short. Further investigations are needed to quantitatively assess the relationship between the maximum duration of the used sounding sequences and the short-term statistics of phase noise for this compensation to be effective.

40|$|The {{difficult}} problem of parameterizing tropical convection in large-scale {{models of the}} atmosphere led to the Global Atmospheric Research Program's Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE), whose goal was to improve basic understanding of tropical convection {{and its role in}} the global atmospheric circula-tion. A dense network of instrumented ships equipped with upper air <b>sounding</b> <b>equipment</b> and quan-titative weather radars were located over the Atlantic Ocean, in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), just west of equatorial Africa. The ship network was supplemented by a fleet of research aircraft and a geosynchronous meteorological satellite.

The clusters were characterized by large mid-to-upper level cloud shields, or 'anvil clouds, ' that emanated from penetrative cumulonimbus convection. Accompanying the deep cumulo-nimbus in each cluster was a log normal spectrum of smaller convective features ranging from moderate cumulonimbus down to tiny nonprecipitating cumulus. The large cumulonimbus were typically grouped within a cluster into one or more mesoscale precipitation features (or MPF's), which were apparently triggered in mesoscale regions of intensified low-level convergence. As an MPF matured it developed a region of stratiform precipitation adjacent to its active deep convective cells. The stratiform precipitatio...|$|E
40|$|Measuring depth at sea in {{the early}} nineteenth century was a {{complicated}} affair. A single sounding event could take many hours and required the ship’s position to be accurately estimated throughout the duration of the investigation. Bad weather moved ships off course and curtailed sounding events in mid-flow. Overestimations were commonplace when underwater currents dragged the lead horizontally through the water, whilst the crewmen on board ship continued to pay out the line. To add to these difficulties was the issue of instrumentation: no one sounding device was universally agreed upon to provide reliable results. As a consequence the representation of the deep sea changed dramatically as the nineteenth century progressed. Whilst much has been written of Maury’s first bathymetric maps, this paper focuses on the lesser explored area of depth recording during the Arctic expeditions of Captains John Ross, William Parry and John Franklin. Testing of new scientific equipment was also one of the key goals of early nineteenth century polar expeditions organised and funded by the British Admiralty. I suggest in this thesis that the reason one piece of <b>sounding</b> <b>equipment</b> became favoured over another was its ease of use by the crew on board ship. I go on to consider Bruno Latour’s idea of transcriptions, and argue that rather than using sounding maps at this time as immutable mobiles, the expedition captains were forced to perform new soundings all the time, and construct new maps of the polar seas as they experienced them. This thesis draws on Actor-Network theory to suggest soundings in the Polar Regions at this time were part of a wider of network of scientific investigation and navigation, and that no network of technology, men and representations were constructed strong enough to withstand the dissociating forces of the polar seas and adverse weather at this point in time...|$|E
40|$|As an open cast mine {{reaches its}} {{economic}} limit {{many companies are}} deciding to leave a void up against the final high wall which subsequently fills up with water and deposited material. Sedimentation and deposited material build up in flooded open cast mine workings and is not being accounted for in the future mine plan and cost modelling phase of these areas. To understand this anomaly of additional overburden removal and pumping requirements, a bathymetric sounding survey is required so that overburden and coal extraction productivity rates can be more accurately determined. Bathymetry data can be collected using {{a wide variety of}} sensors including: lead lines, single beam and multi beam acoustic depth sounders, as well as airborne laser sensors, but are usually collected as a series of cross section lines. Bathymetric techniques will be analysed to determine whether inexpensive bathymetric equipment coupled with Real Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Positioning System (GPS) technology can provide a high level of precision, accuracy and what effect different transect and point spacing have on the accuracy of the volumes of deposited material.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Arctic lakes {{can provide}} a {{long-term}} perspective on environmental change, including trends in long-range atmospheric transport and deposition of contaminants, inferred from studies of sediment cores. In this study, we conducted the first detailed bathymetric survey of Lake Hazen (Quttinirpaaq National Park, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut), the world’s largest lake north of 74 ˚ latitude. With these data {{we were able to}} determine optimal locations for sediment coring and to collect and analyze profundal sediment cores. A bathymetric map of Lake Hazen was developed on the basis of 362 spot soundings obtained with GPS-coupled <b>sounding</b> <b>equipment</b> placed directly on the ice combined with additional soundings from a small boat. The deepest point in the lake (81 4 ̊ 9. 5 ʹ N; 70 4 ̊ 2. 8 ʹ W) was found to be 267 m deep. The lake volume was estimated to be 5. 14 × 1010 m 3, about 10 % larger than previous estimates. Using estimates of the discharge of Lake Hazen from the Water Survey of Canada, we estimated the water retention time to be 89 years. Sediment cores were dated using 210 Pb and 137 Cs. Sedimentation rates at the deep point, estimated using the Constant Rate of Supply model for excess 210 Pb, were relatively high (1260 g m- 2 yr- 1) in the period 2005 – 1963 and lower (650 ± 100 g m- 2 yr- 1) in horizons dated to 1950 – 1880. The majority of elements measured in sediment (24 of 29 consistently above detection limits), as well as organic carbon, showed less than 20 % variation in concentrations in the top 10 cm (compacted depth), which represent deposition over approximately 140 years. Geochemical characteristics of the sediment suggest that erosional inputs from annual glacial melting are the major source of essentially all elements and that anthropogenic inputs from long-range transport of toxic metals such as mercury and lead are very low...|$|E
40|$|Many marine {{scientists}} and {{users of the}} sea consider knowledge of the sea bottom as basic data, a mere context {{to carry out research}} or deploy activities. Some disciplines do need more accurate bathymetric data than others, depending on depth values being background information or crucial information for their research or activities. In bathymetry, the representation of the sea bottom surface is the main objective and hence, this discipline will try to render the sea bottom relief as accurate as possible. The latest bathymetric <b>sounding</b> <b>equipment</b> that is available nowadays, especially the multibeam echosounder, yield a very dense bottom sampling. When compared to the common singlebeam echosounder, an enormous amount of data is produced that needs to be processed in a correct and fast way. Grid-overlay (by local linear or more sophisticated interpolation and attributing values to individual grid cells) is not an option here as this method uses an interpolation of the measured values and hence will either cause accuracy loss or generate a still larger amount of data. A triangular irregular network (TIN for short), especially the Delaunay triangulation (Dt), does respect the actual measurements and will not generate new data. In literature, a number of algorithms have been developed that determine the Dt of a set of points (vertices) given in the plane. A performant divide-and-conquer algorithm for Delaunay triangulations was implemented to triangulate large quantities of data in minimum time. Comparison with other implemented algorithms demonstrates its excellent performance. In some cases, {{it will be necessary to}} adapt the terrain model. Theoretical terrain models (for instance design models for marine contractors) require manual interventions, while new surveys partially overlapping old data will have to replace the latter. Therefore, the incremental algorithm has been adapted to allow insertion of individual points. When eliminating individual vertices, the hole thus created has to be retriangulated. Vertices belonging to a triangulation that is (partially) covered by a new surveyed area can be eliminated and using a very keen adaptation of the divide-and-conquer principle, the overlapping triangulations can be stitched together. This is a novel technique with the big advantage of quickly and seamlessly joining two large triangulations, without the need for retriangulation of the entire area. Part of the immense amount of data generated by a multibeam echosounder will unavoidably be redundant. An important issue therefore will be: filtering these data, keeping those points that still assure an optimal accuracy. This accuracy can be expressed as a function of the topography or as a function of the volume. For the latter, not the height difference determines whether or not a vertex is allowed in the triangulation, the criterion is rather the change in volume caused by this one vertex. For marine contractors, it is mainly the latter that is important. A hybrid model would be most adequate...|$|E

For operation in indoor environments {{the proximity of the}} human body can cause shadowing and perturbations of the transmitted signal. Radio frequency sounding is often employed to characterise the UWB radio channel in an effort to investigate such phenomena. This thesis explores statistical characterisation of the off-body S 1 S 0 and MISO UWB indoor radio channel between 3. 1 GHz and 6. 0 GHz However, the <b>sounding</b> <b>equipment</b> may itself alter the radio channel parameters and to this end, a comparison of an optical and radiofrequency (RP) cable feeding the body-mounted antenna for an off-body UWB link was performed. This revealed that the RP cables add measurement error due to their reflective construction, increasing launch scattering and post-launch reflections. This was found to be particularly evident for low reflectivity environments and for non line of sight (NLOS) configurations. Indeed, the use of cables was found to increase received power, increase multipath delay and had the potential to alter the channel's statistical distribution model. This was found to be true for 89 % ofNLOS and 44 % of LOS experiments. The same novel optical cable fed UWB sounder was implemented to investigate off-body links in a 49 m 2 hospital environment for both stationary and mobile UWB radio transmitters mounted on the waist and chest. The results showed that received signal strength values were dependent on whether transmit and receive antennas had line of sight (LOS) and were also affected by body- shadowing and antenna-body position. For mobile conditions, received signal strength tended to be Lognormally distributed with NLOS links having significantly lower mean values. Excess time delay results for the mobile user tests were best described by the Weibull distribution. Overall, the results favoured the chest mounted antenna position, with higher mean signal levels, reduced mean excess delay and less difference between LOS and NLOS channels. Additionally, {{it was found that the}} Rician k-factor values for the anechoic and hospital environment were significantly affected by environmental conditions, highlighting that the human body acts primarily as part of the radiating structure. Nonetheless, variations in the k-factor values for the differing antenna mounting positions also indicated that this was also a factor affecting off-body radiation. Finally, the performance of a multiple antenna body-centric transmitter was investigated in an office and corridor environment. It was found that when using such a multi-antenna array, all the distributions for each of the channels were Lognormally distributed in the office and Rician in the corridor. It was also found that using selection combining techniques, all the distributions for two-channel diversity and three-channel diversity for both LOS and NLOS journeys were mostly Lognormally distributed in the office and the corridor. Thus, use of simple channel diversity techniques changed the channel's statistical distribution from Rician for a single channel to Lognormal for combined channels in the corridor. A general correlation between mutual coupling between the antennas in the array and the received power values on each channel was found. It was also found that when the antenna array was placed on the body with such a configuration as presented here, diversity gains were poor, in the region of only 1 dB. Overall, the results in this thesis indicate that off-body UWB channel characterisation should be conducted with optical fed antennas and more research into antenna positioning to attain diversity gain is required.

40|$|In many ACP {{countries}} with growing populations, water scarcity {{is a major}} obstacle to agricultural development. For decades, scientists have grappled {{with the challenge of}} producing rain by artificial means, and new technology has brought them closer to their goal. But does it really work? By the year 2025, two-thirds of the world s population will have to cope with water stresses, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Increasing demands for fresh water due to rapid population growth, coupled with recent periods of severe drought, have focused the spotlight on Africa. Some 66 % of the continent is now classed as desert or drylands and 3 % of agricultural GDP is lost annually to soil and nutrient loss in sub-Saharan Africa. But the picture in parts of the Caribbean and Pacific is hardly more encouraging. In the International Year of Deserts and Desertification, the challenge of developing new water sources for large areas of the South has become a matter of great urgency. Some scientists believe that modern technology may have the answer. What is needed, they say, is to make more rain. In order to coax precious water out of the skies, experts have developed techniques which involve showering clouds with chemical particles, releasing rain to irrigate crops or replenish aquifers. Interest in rainmaking was spurred by the Sahelian drought crisis of 1968 - 1974, but weather modification to give it its official name has been around for some time. Nearly all modern attempts to modify the weather involve cloud seeding, using rockets, planes, cannons or ground generators to fire particles into clouds to encourage water vapour to gather round them and make them fall as rain. Cloud seeding dates back to the late 1940 s when two US scientists accidentally discovered that supercooled water droplets could be converted to ice crystals using either dry ice or silver iodide. Trials in the atmosphere soon followed, and operational cloud seeding programmes began in about 1950. In more recent times, improvements in observational facilities and modelling capabilities have allowed more detailed examination of precipitation processes and offered new opportunities. The development of new equipment such as aircraft platforms with microphysical and air-motion measuring systems, radar, satellites and automated rain gauge networks has brought rainmaking closer to reality. Too good to be true? According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), cloud seeding projects are now being conducted in more than 40 countries, including Australia, China, India, Russia and the US. In the ACP region, South Africa leads the field, with Burkina Faso emerging as a more recent player. Senegal has started on a rain enhancement programme and in Zimbabwe, cloud seeding has been regularly used to help agriculture during inadequate natural rainfall periods. How it works Cloud seeding works on the principle of stimulating clouds with substances to release rain. Cold clouds and warm clouds require different seeding methods. Cold cloud seeding, also known as glaciogenic seeding, involves firing silver iodide into clouds to trigger the formation of ice crystals. Warm cloud seeding, or hygroscopic seeding, was developed by South African scientists, who experimented with firing salt crystals using flares strapped to an aircraft wing. 1. Aircraft or rockets spray substances (e. g. silver iodide or dry ice) into clouds to encourage tiny vapour droplets to coalesce. 2. These droplets of supercooled water (liquid below freezing) coalesce into snow and melt as they fall. 3. Heat released as the droplets freeze boosts updrafts, which pull more moist air into the cloud. On the face of it, the advantages of cloud seeding are clear. According to the WMO, analyses have shown that the technology can produce significant economic benefits. A South African team which has conducted a long-term study of cloud seeding claims the technique can increase the mass of water droplets in a cloud by up to 60 %. The team carried out experimental seeding programmes in the drought-stricken Limpopo province and a cost-benefit analysis concluded that the benefits of cloud seeding outweighed the costs by a ratio of 1 : 7, with sizeable increases in rain-fed agricultural yields, such as maize, pasture and timber. But in spite of its apparent potential, cloud seeding remains a controversial practice, and in some scientific circles, there is scepticism that such methods can offer a viable means of increasing water resources. Many experts agree that fundamental questions need to be answered to provide a sound scientific basis for the technology. The Kenya government attempted cloud seeding back in the 1960 s, but abandoned it after achieving disappointing results. One factor hampering widespread use of cloud seeding in the South is the high start-up cost. The technology requires sophisticated equipment, monitoring procedures and materials, including at least three airplanes for each operation, as well as meteorological radar and air <b>sounding</b> <b>equipment</b> a computer system and data analysis software, a rain gauge network and automatic weather stations. In Zimbabwe, where aircraft were mainly supplied by the farming community, a major problem has been a lack of sufficient planes. No clouds, no rain But in order to make rain, you also need suitable cloud formations. Cloud seeding cannot be carried out on just any old cloud. And most areas that are short of rain are also short of clouds. No clouds, no seeding, and therefore no rain. According to Italian agrometeorologist Pasquale Steduto, in order to have rain, you need a cloud in an incipient condition. This technique has not taken off because in arid and semi-arid conditions clouds are lacking, and therefore the seeding does not help. Seeding the skies in South Africa Among ACP countries, South Africa has {{played a key role in}} developing operational techniques for cloud seeding, and has produced some of the most encouraging results. The National Precipitation Research Programme (NPRP), formed in the 1990 s, developed the hygroscopic flare for seeding convective storms, which suck in humid air from close to the Earth s surface. It also developed radar technology for cloud seeding, now being used in more than 20 projects in six other countries. Experiments conducted between 1991 and 1997 found that seeded storms translated into an average increase of between 20 % and 48 % in the average annual runoff in 13 different catchments over the eastern Highveld and escarpment. The model also showed average increases of 22 % in timber yields due to cloud seeding. Now known as the South African Rainfall Enhancement Programme (SAREP), the South African team is setting up a network of weather radars to provide the final link in the chain of proof the evidence that rain from seeded clouds actually falls on the ground where it is needed. Cloud seeding also requires a considerable degree of fine tuning. The idea is to increase the number of water droplets in a cloud, but quantity alone is not enough only clouds with droplets of varying sizes will actually produce rain. And precipitation mechanisms can differ dramatically from one location to another. A report from the May 2005 meeting of the WMO s working group on weather modification warned: Cloud structure can vary widely from region to region. Seeding results obtained in one geographic area cannot be automatically assumed to apply to another area. One of the main drawbacks of the technique is lack of control over where the rain will fall, a fundamental consideration, especially for small island states. What is the point of generating extra rain if it is going to fall into the sea? Scientist Roelof Bruintjes of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) says Increasing the rainfall is just one aspect. We also have to consider what the impact would be. Every cloud has a silver lining The government of Burkina Faso has estimated that cash earnings from agriculture have increased by 10 to 15 % since it began its cloud seeding programme in 1998. The additional rainfall created has helped to fill reservoirs, allowing irrigated cultivation to continue during the dry season. As a result, imports, particularly of cereals, have dropped and in some parts of the country fresh tomatoes are now available all year round. With technical assistance from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Burkina Faso has set up software systems to support cloud seeding efforts. The software is used to display and analyse radar data about cloud systems and precipitation, thereby guiding cloud seeding operations and helping scientists evaluate the results. Burkina Faso s cloud seeding programme has proved so successful, that the Inter State Committee Against Drought in the Sahel (CILSS) is hoping to find backing for a US$ 60 million (50 million) programme to extend cloud seeding to its other eight member countries. The US-based NCAR has been in the forefront of weather modification research in Mexico and South Africa. The centre has refined a technique to increase the size of particles in clouds and promote the coalescence of water droplets. Called hygroscopic seeding, this technique uses flares mounted on aircraft to seed clouds with small salt particles which, however, do not affect the quality of the resulting rainwater. In the air, water droplets bond to the particles and grow large enough to fall out of the cloud as rain. More research Evaluation of results remains a major challenge. Scientists need to be able to provide proof of cause and effect that it really is cloud seeding which has produced a specific downfall of rain. Some have their doubts, among them Rene Gommes, Senior Agrometeorology Officer at FAO. The problem is, no one knows whether it really works or not. Unless you carry out extensive testing in exactly the same place for, say 20 years, you will never be able to say that it would not have rained anyway. While giving a cautious welcome to weather modification initiatives, the WMO wants to see far more research and scientific evaluation. It is crucial to recognise that the current technology is immature, it warns. It also calls for greater cooperation between countries to spread the burden of funding costly technologies. Economic, social and legal aspects must also be taken into account, and international guidelines will be needed, especially when cloud seeding operations are taking place close to borders. If a cloud is seeded in one country, the rain may fall in another. There is still unresolved debate over whether producing rainfall by artificial means in one region will rob another of its natural share. The practice recently caused friction between neighbouring states in China, and, on one occasion, prompted drought-ridden Mali to accuse Niger of stealing its rain. In many ACP {{countries with}} growing populations, water scarcity is a major obstacle to agricultural development [...] ...|$|E
