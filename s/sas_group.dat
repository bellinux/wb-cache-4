5|$|Boeing 737-700s {{were taken}} into use {{starting}} in 1998, and the company rebranded from Braathens SAFE to Braathens. That year also saw the opening of Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which increased Braathens number of slots and allowed them {{to start a new}} route to Haugesund. Braathens started a costly price war with its competitors Color Air and SAS; after Color Air went bankrupt in 1999, Braathens started terminating routes, and the Swedish division was merged into the subsidiary Malmö Aviation. Málaga and Alicante were introduced as destinations in 2000. The next year, Braathens was bought by the <b>SAS</b> <b>Group,</b> and in 2002, the routes were split between SAS and Braathens. The latter kept only four international routes, but was granted new services to Northern Norway: Alta, Bardufoss, Kirkenes and Lakselv. Braathens was merged with SAS to create SAS Braathens in 2004.|$|E
5|$|On 2 April 2002, SAS and Braathens split all {{the routes}} between them. SAS started flying on the main-haul routes from Oslo to Trondheim, Bergen and Stavanger, {{with only a}} few flights to Stavanger flown by Braathens to get planes to the {{technical}} base there. From Oslo and Trondheim to Northern Norway, all routes were taken over by Braathens, with exception of a few flights made by SAS to Tromsø and Bodø. SAS also withdrew their flights from Oslo to Kristiansand and Ålesund, and Braathens increased their frequency on the route. Braathens retained the routes it had flown where SAS had not formerly flown. Braathens also kept the international flights to Barcelona, Nice, Málaga and Alicante. This reduced the overcapacity in the market, and allowed the <b>SAS</b> <b>Group</b> to save between NOK600 and 900 million.|$|E
5|$|The airline {{was founded}} by {{shipowner}} Ludvig G. Braathen and initially flew to destinations in Asia. The original fleet consisted of Douglas aircraft; these were first used for long-haul flights, but were gradually shifted for use in medium- and short-haul charter services. The airline started domestic services in 1954, with all its scheduled routes flown domestically until 1987. However, it continued to fly charter services from both Norway and Sweden, mostly to the Mediterranean. For Norwegian routes, Braathens first used a fleet of Herons, which were replaced with the Fokker F27 from 1958. The airline became the launch customer of the Fokker F28 in 1969 and also took delivery of Boeing 737-200 aircraft. The jet aircraft were at first used for charter, but later also for domestic services. All later deliveries would consist of Boeing aircraft, and after 1977 Braathens operated only jets. Between 1986 and 1989 the airline operated only the 737-200. By 1994, {{they had all been}} replaced with 737-400 and -500. Braathens entered the Swedish internal market in 1997 by purchasing Transwede and Malmö Aviation. This gave the airline a wider range of aircraft, including the 737-700, Fokker 100 and BAe 146. The losses suffered under a price war with Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and Color Air in 1998 and 1999 caused the airline to be taken over by the <b>SAS</b> <b>Group</b> in 2001. Braathens and SAS Norway merged to form SAS Braathens in 2004.|$|E

25|$|Following {{a period}} of intense price war and huge losses, the <b>SAS</b> <b>Group</b> was given {{permission}} to buy its main domestic competitor Braathens in late 2001. After having been a substantial owner since 1997, the <b>SAS</b> <b>Group</b> took full ownership of Norwegian regional carrier Widerøe in May 2002. Braathens' regional services in Western Norway were at the time operated by the subcarrier Norwegian Air Shuttle. SAS announced in 2002 that it intended that these route {{be taken over by}} SAS Commuter, while the Norlink services would be operated by Widerøe, where the latter already had a major presence. The latter took effect in October 2002. After Norwegian relaunched themselves as a low-cost carrier in September 2002, they were eager to rid themselves of regional routes. SAS therefore agreed to pay Norwegian NOK65 million cash to terminate the routes from 1 April 2003.|$|E
