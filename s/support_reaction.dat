40|$|T-beam Bridge is {{a common}} choice among the {{designers}} for small and medium span bridges. In order to cater to greater speed and more safety of present day traffic, the modern highways are to be straight as far as possible. This requirement, along with other requirements for fixing alignment of the bridges, is mainly responsible for provision of increasing number of skew bridges. The presence of skew in a bridge makes the analysis and design of bridge decks intricate. For the T-beam bridges with small skew angle, it is frequently considered safe to ignore the angle of skew and analyze the bridge as a right bridge with a span equal to the skew span. However, T-beam bridges with large angle of skew can have a considerable effect {{on the behavior of}} the bridge especially in the short to medium range of spans. In this paper a study on the behavior of T-beam skew bridges with respect to <b>support</b> <b>reactions</b> under standard IRC- 70 R wheeled loading is presented and the study was based on the analytical modeling of T-beam bridges by Grillage Analogy method. Effects of <b>support</b> <b>reactions</b> for different spans have been studied.

Hence the dynamic system of infinite-degree-of-freedom is simplified as a system with only one unknown without any loss of precision. Nonlinear governing equations are developed through considering the effect of quadratic terms of displacements.
