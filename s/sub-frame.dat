25|$|Lancia's {{reputation}} was significantly undermined in 1980, when defective Lancia Beta models, suffering from significant suspension <b>sub-frame</b> corrosion problems, were purchased back from owners {{by the company}} in a highly publicised campaign. These cars were subsequently crushed. The brand never recovered from the damage inflicted during the Beta recall and, combined {{with a range of}} related factors (including poor residual values, which made their range uncompetitive), decided to withdraw from the right hand drive market in February 1994. The last model be sold in the United Kingdom was the Delta, boosted by its rallying reputation, withdrawn from sale in 1995.|$|E
2500|$|The Routemaster was a {{departure}} from the traditional chassis/body construction method. It {{was one of the first}} [...] "integral" [...] buses, with a combination of an [...] "A" [...] steel <b>sub-frame</b> (including engine, steering and front suspension) and a rear [...] "B" [...] steel <b>sub-frame</b> (carrying rear axle and suspension), connected by an aluminium body. The gearbox was mounted on the underside of the body structure with shafts to the engine and back axle. Later pre-war London trolleybuses, however, had previously adopted chassisless construction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{caliper brake}} is {{a class of}} cable-actuated brake in which the brake mounts to a single point above the wheel, {{theoretically}} allowing the arms to auto-centre on the rim. [...] Arms extend around the tyre and end in brake shoes that press against the rim. [...] While some designs incorporate dual pivot points [...] the arms pivot on a <b>sub-frame</b> [...] the entire assembly still mounts to a single point.|$|E

30|$|In the LTE-Advanced system, the in-band {{resource}} partitioning {{is based}} on the Multimedia Broadcast over Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) <b>sub-frames</b> [41]. If an RN configures some of its <b>sub-frames</b> as the MBSFN <b>sub-frames,</b> the UEs connected to this RN are informed that during those <b>sub-frames</b> they should not expect any communication to be exchanged on the access link. Since in the MBSFN <b>sub-frames</b> the RN is not required to transmit reference signals, it is free to communicate then with the DeNB on the backhaul link.|$|R
3000|$|When the {{interference}} priority {{and the service}} priority are jointly considered, the shifting priority calculation {{can be divided into}} two cases: (1) If there are few downlink <b>sub-frames,</b> we need to increase the downlink <b>sub-frames</b> to increase the shifting priority Prior_R^i [...] that is determined by S_R^i [...] and Traffic_R^i (2) if there are excessive downlink <b>sub-frames,</b> we need to decrease the downlink <b>sub-frames</b> to decrease the shifting priority Prior_L^i [...] that is determined by S_L^i [...] and Traffic_L^i [...].|$|R
2500|$|In 1952, Leyland began {{experimenting with}} ideas for a rear-engined {{double-decker}} bus. [...] A prototype was built, {{with a body}} by Saunders-Roe, to the maximum permitted width of [...] [...] It was fitted with a turbocharged version of the Leyland O.350 engine, which was transversely mounted {{at the rear of}} the <b>sub-frame.</b> [...] The chassis was a platform-type frame of steel and light alloy with deep stressed side-members. An automatic clutch and self change gearbox were also fitted. [...] The vehicle was designated the PDR1 (R for [...] "Rear-engined").|$|E
2500|$|In mid 1928 the Scout Series 101 {{replaced}} the original Scout. Designed by Charles B. Franklin, who had designed the original Scout, the 101 Scout {{had a new}} frame with more fork rake, a longer wheelbase, and a lower seat height. The geometry of the 101 Scout wheelbase, steering head angle and rear <b>sub-frame</b> were all adopted from the new Indian 401 model which was under development at the same time. [...] The standard Scout 101 was available with a [...] engine, {{but it was also}} available with a [...] engine from the original Scout, although this was rarely advertised.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanically, the {{prototype}} Atlantean [...] {{was similar to}} the Lowloader with an O.600 engine transversely mounted at the rear with a pneumo-cyclic gearbox situated in the rear offside corner providing drive in a straight line from the engine. The Atlantean had a light and strong fabricated frame. Light alloy floor plates were rivetted directly to the framework, fulfilling the dual purpose of reinforcing the frame and providing a foundation for the saloon floor. The platform-type <b>sub-frame</b> concept from the Lowloader was retained for {{the prototype}}. A drop-centre rear axle allowed the flat floor, only one step up from ground level, to continue for the full length of the bus.|$|E
30|$|Hall {{monitor in}} GOP 8, however, {{is a low}} motion video sequence, and most blocks are skipped; thus, {{functional}} block <b>sub-framing</b> is used. The encoder is therefore partially occupied with the <b>sub-framing</b> block during processing time.|$|R
40|$|Watermark bits {{embedded}} in audio signals considering the sample’s relative {{state in a}} frame may strengthen the attack-invariant features of audio watermarking algorithm. In this work, we propose to embed watermarks in an audio signal considering {{the relation between the}} mean values of consecutive groups of samples which shows robustness by overcoming common watermarking challenges. Here, we divide the host audio signal into equal-sized non-overlapping frames which in turn is split into four equalsized non-overlapping <b>sub-frames.</b> After, transforming these <b>sub-frames</b> in cepstrum domain we finally use the relation between the differences of first two <b>sub-frames</b> and last two <b>sub-frames</b> to embed watermarks. Depending on the watermark bit (either 0 or 1) to be embed, our embedding technique either interchange or update the differences between these groups of samples by distorting the sample values in <b>sub-frames</b> selectively. Thus, watermarks are embedded by making a little or no distortion of the <b>sub-frames</b> which helps our scheme to be imperceptible in nature. Moreover, use of such embedding technique lead our watermarking scheme to a computationally less complex extraction method. Simulation results also justify our claim of the proposed scheme to be both robust and imperceptible...|$|R
3000|$|For {{the dynamic}} TDD frame {{configuration}} method based on traffic and interference, we {{give priority to}} increasing the downlink <b>sub-frames</b> for cells with high Prior_R^i [...] and decreasing the downlink <b>sub-frames</b> for cells with high Prior_L^i [...]. The TDD frame configuration includes the following processes.|$|R
2500|$|Despite these similarities, a {{spokesman}} from Honda R Americas stated that 50% of the Honda Pilot's chassis components {{had to be}} changed or strengthened {{for use in the}} second generation Ridgeline. [...] The C-pillar and rear <b>sub-frame</b> mounts had to be strengthened as well giving the second generation Ridgeline 28% more torsional rigidity over the first generation Ridgeline. [...] According to one of the Ridgeline’s body development engineers, [...] "Utilizing fully boxed frame members for the body sides and rear tailgate frame, the truss-style rear inner construction contributes to the new Ridgeline’s more conventional three-box design profile allowing for the elimination of the buttress-style body structure" [...] of the first generation Ridgeline.|$|E

30|$|If blank <b>sub-frames</b> are employed, {{even when}} such a noise level {{adjustment}} does not occur, the periodic scheduling of LTE active <b>sub-frames</b> collides with ongoing WiFi transmissions, which will likely experience other collisions during the LTE frames and increase the backoff counter accordingly, thus resulting in a reduction of the channel access rate.|$|R
3000|$|We {{know that}} the more {{downlink}} <b>sub-frames</b> a cell uses, the stronger its anti-interference ability is and the more interference it will bring to other cells. For a low SINR cell, {{it is better to}} increase the downlink <b>sub-frames</b> to enhance its anti-interference ability, and we use its neighboring cell’s worst SINR reduction as the interference priority, which is denoted as S_R^i [...]. Similarly, for a high SINR cell, we should reduce its downlink <b>sub-frames</b> to reduce the interference to adjacent cells, and we use its worse SINR reduction as the interference priority, which is denoted as S_L^i [...].|$|R

50|$|Two engines were {{available}} an all-new 2.4-liter 2AZ-FE VVT-i I4 engine and a carry over 3.0-liter 1MZ-FE V6 engine. Both engines in the United States were ULEV certified. Any model could {{be equipped with}} a V6 or a 4-speed automatic transmission, although the manual transmission was not available on V6 models. The Camry's front suspension used MacPherson struts mounted to a front <b>sub-frame</b> while the rear suspension used a dual link setup also mounted to its own rear <b>sub-frame.</b>|$|E
50|$|Wobulation {{works by}} {{overlapping}} pixels. It does so by generating multiple sub-frames of data while an optical image shifting mechanism (e.g. {{the mirror of}} a digital micromirror device) then displaces the projected image of each <b>sub-frame</b> by {{a fraction of a}} pixel (e.g. one-half or one-third). The sub-frames are then projected in rapid succession, and appear to the human eye as if they are being projected simultaneously and superimposed. For example, a high-resolution HDTV video frame is divided into two sub-frames, A and B. <b>Sub-frame</b> A is projected, and then the miniature mirror on a digital micromirror device switches and displaces <b>sub-frame</b> B one half pixel length as it is projected. When projected in rapid succession, the sub-frames superimpose, and create to the human eye a complete and seamless image. If the video sub-frames are aligned so that the corners of the pixels in the second <b>sub-frame</b> are projected at the centers of the first, the illusion of double the resolution is achieved, like in an interlaced CRT display. Thus a lower resolution fixed pixel device using wobulation can emulate the picture of higher resolution fixed device, at a reduced cost.|$|E
3000|$|After {{obtaining the}} {{shifting}} priority that {{is determined by}} both of the interference priority and the traffic priority, {{if we want to}} increase the downlink <b>sub-frames,</b> we can choose the cell with the maximum Prior_R^i [...] value, and if we want to decrease the downlink <b>sub-frames,</b> we can choose the cell with the maximum Prior_L^i [...] value.|$|R
30|$|The in-band relays {{operate with}} the {{backhaul}} link allocated {{at the same}} carrier as the access link. In this case, the transmission–reception isolation at RN is performed in the time domain (TD) using the MBSFN sub-frames[22]. Thus, the RN receives from DeNB only during the MBSFN <b>sub-frames,</b> and transmits to the relayed users only during the non-MBSFN <b>sub-frames.</b>|$|R

The front suspension, monocoque, and bodywork ahead of the rear <b>sub-frame</b> {{was derived from the}} KR200, but the rear <b>sub-frame</b> bore a suspension and drivetrain with twice the number of wheels and an engine with twice the number of cylinders and more than twice the displacement. The Tg500 was aimed primarily at sporting enthusiasts and was built from 1958 to 1961. About 320 were made.|$|E
