I thought, here's the guy historically placed to give Lennon–McCartney a good deal at last, 'cos we got signed when we were 21 or something in a back alley in Liverpool. And the deal, it's remained the same, even though we made this company the most famous – hugely successful. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> thinking, {{it was time for}} a raise... I did talk to him about it, but he kind of blanked me on it. He kept saying, 'That's just business, Paul.' You know. So, I thought, 'Yeah, it is,' and waited for a reply, but we never kind of got to it... It was no big bust-up. We kind of drifted apart after that".|$|E
25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{tried to}} put {{different}} things in the video {{that made me feel}} under pressure and it really did! It was the hardest video I`ve ever done <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> thinking, why on earth did I come up with this concept? People don’t realise but I definitely have that Australian tomboy side to me. I love snakes and sharks and jumping out of planes and stuff. Growing up {{it never occurred to me}} that it wasn’t a girly thing to ride a bike, covered in mud holding frogs and collecting lizards!".|$|E
60|$|Within sixty seconds I was {{standing}} erect {{in the rear}} of the building which Master Lord counted to be our prison, free to go whithersoever <b>I</b> would, <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> myself clear from the patrol and did not blunder upon too many Tories.|$|R
60|$|FOR {{a couple}} of hours I walked on briskly, {{careless}} in what direction <b>I</b> went, <b>so</b> long as <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> my back turned on Barkingham.|$|R
60|$|She {{was still}} unconscious. The heavy lifebelt round her person must (<b>so</b> <b>I</b> divined) have <b>kept</b> her afloat after the wreck. Her clothes were sodden, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> reasoned, with the sea-water.|$|R
500|$|At {{the age of}} nine, Swift became {{interested}} in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her [...] "want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure {{that she needed to}} go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since [...] "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> thinking to myself, I need {{to figure out a way}} to be different".|$|E
500|$|By September 2013, Sia was {{recording}} vocal tracks at {{her home}} studio {{with the hope of}} releasing a new album the following spring. Later that year, a team of RCA Records representatives including the label's CEO Peter Edge met with Sia to discuss a record deal. The singer agreed to a contract for a new album in which she was not obliged to tour or do press appearances to promote the album. In an interview published by NME in February 2015, Sia revealed that 1000 Forms of Fear was released as a contractual obligation: [...] "Basically, I put this out {{to get out of my}} publishing deal. I was planning to be a pop song writer for other artists. But my publishing deal was as an artist so I had to put one more album out. I didn't want to get famous <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> all the songs I wanted and had a lot of fun making it." ...|$|E
500|$|Appearing on the Late Show with David Letterman {{shortly after}} Jackson died in 2009, McCartney spoke about Jackson's {{acquisition}} of the Beatles songs {{and the impact of}} it on their relationship:And which was, you know, that was cool, somebody had to get it, I suppose. What happened actually was then I started to ring him up. I thought, OK, here's the guy historically placed to give Lennon–McCartney a good deal at last. Cuz we got signed when we were 21 or something in a back alley in Liverpool. And the deal, it's remained the same, even though we made this company the most famous… hugely successful. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> thinking, {{it was time for a}} raise. Well you would, you know. [...] And so it was great. But I did talk to him about it. But he kind of blanked me on it. He kept saying, [...] "That's just business Paul." [...] You know. So, [...] "yeah it is", and waited for a reply. But we never kind of got to it. And I thought, mm.... So we kind of drifted apart. It was no big bust up. We kind of drifted apart after that. But he was a lovely man, massively talented, and we miss him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did," [...] {{replied the}} boy. [...] "I {{remember}} that you wanted it, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> have <b>kept</b> it with me ever since that night. Here it is." [...] And he presented the little blue book to the Majordomo, the only friend the adventurers had found among all the Blueskins.|$|R
5000|$|According to Herbert, [...] "War {{crimes are}} {{infinitely}} easier to overlook than {{to explain to}} an investigating committee. Nor do they do much for promotion among the 'West Point Protection Society' of the Army's upper-echelon career men. <b>So</b> when <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> bringing up the matter, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> on making enemies and getting answers such as, [...] "'what {{the hell did you}} expect, Herbert? Candy and flowers?' I reported these things and nothing happened." ...|$|R
5000|$|Novelist Galaxy Craze {{has said}} of Gordon, [...] "She loves to read; she would read us {{passages}} {{in class and}} start crying, she's so moved by really good writing. And {{she was the only}} good writing teacher at Barnard, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> just <b>kept</b> taking her class over and over. She taught me so much." ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{possible}} {{evidence that}} the [...] "sexual song" [...] theory was created later, songwriter LaBostrie was quoted as saying, [...] "Little Richard didn't write none of 'Tutti Frutti'. I'll tell you exactly how I came to write that. I used to live on Galvez Street and my girlfriend and I liked {{to go down to}} the drug store and buy ice cream. One day we went in and saw this new flavor, Tutti Frutti. Right away I thought, 'Boy, that's a great idea for a song'. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> it in the back of my mind until I got to the studio that day. I also wrote the flip side of 'Tutti Frutti', 'I'm Just A Lonely Guy', and a spiritual, 'Blessed Mother', all in the same day." [...] LaBostrie was still receiving royalty checks on the average of $5,000 every three to six months from the song in the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his last}} days, {{some of his}} new disciples began to preach him as God Almighty. I was afraid my meeting with such men would give rise to {{unpleasant}} discussions. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> away. At last, when the news of his fast declining health was brought to me one day, I left all work and went to Dakshineswar. I found him very low. That was before his removal to a more commodious house on the riverside for treatment. Ramkrishna took me to task for neglecting him. I pleaded guilty to the charge and made a clean breast of it by letting him know the exact causes, I smiled and said, “As there are many editions of a book so {{there have been many}} editions of God Almighty and your disciples are about to make you a new one.” He too smiled and said, “Just fancy, God Almighty dying of cancer in the throat. What great fools these fellows must be!” ...|$|E
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be no remark which I could make, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> silence.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not a word,' {{replied the}} other. 'She plucked and tore at her arms {{for a little}} time; but I held her hands, and she soon dropped off. She hasn't much {{strength}} in her, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> easily <b>kept</b> her quiet. <b>I</b> ain't <b>so</b> weak for an old woman, although I am on parish allowance; no, no!' ...|$|R
60|$|Such, in brief, was {{the manner}} of my resurrection. For a week or <b>so</b> <b>I</b> still <b>kept</b> my chamber; then one day towards the middle of April, the weather being warm and the sun bright, Michelot {{assisted}} me to don my clothes, which hung strangely empty upon my gaunt, emaciated frame, and, leaning heavily upon my faithful henchman, I made my way below.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Papa!' she exclaimed, {{after the}} morning's salutations, 'guess whom I saw yesterday, in my {{walk on the}} moors. Ah, papa, you started! you've not done right, have you, now? I saw--but listen, and you shall hear how I found you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet pretended to pity me <b>so,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> hoping, and was always {{disappointed}} about Linton's coming back!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I found it-—in {{his table}} drawer; I {{saw it was}} not valid, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> {{it out of the}} way from {{consideration}} for you," [...] said Janet.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{looks like}} neglect, I confess; but I'd heard reports of your flirtations, and twice of your being engaged, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> away till my work was done. Was it true?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{called on}} Carry last night, [...] And he came whilst I was there, Not knowing I'd called. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> out of sight, [...] And I heard {{what he said}} to her: ...|$|E
60|$|At first so many eyes {{confused}} me; <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> my own steadily {{upon the}} glossy neck of my mule. Very soon, however, growing {{accustomed to being}} stared at, I lost some of my shyness, {{and now it was}} that I became a trouble to Messer Arcolano. For as I looked about me there were a hundred things to hold my attention and to call for inquiry and nearer inspection.|$|R
6000|$|One {{drenching}} {{afternoon he}} talked tennis {{to me for}} three hours on end, referring to Renshaw, <b>so</b> far as <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> count, four thousand nine hundred and thirteen times. After tea he drew his chair to the window beside me, and commenced-- ...|$|R
60|$|His {{manner of}} playing was rather startling. <b>So</b> long as <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> {{my eyes on}} him he {{remained}} motionless, but the instant my attention wandered, or when in speaking I looked at my companion, the sudden violent dash at my head would be made.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] agreed his companion. [...] "They {{might have}} laid me off a while {{last summer when}} {{we ran out of}} logs, but Mr. Graham fixed it <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> my job." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Desperately jealous. You were so kind, so gay, so {{altogether}} charming when with him, that I {{could not}} stand by and see it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> away. Why were you never so to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Beneath my palm trees, by {{the river}} side, [...] I sat a weeping: {{in the whole world}} wide [...] There was no one to ask me why I wept,-- [...] And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> [...] Brimming the water-lily cups with tears [...] Cold as my fears.|$|E
5|$|We {{could have}} played on, {{but it was a}} Test match and we just had to win. I {{realised}} something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, {{in an effort to get}} the appeal upheld. Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets <b>so</b> <b>I</b> just <b>kept</b> on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|R
60|$|Like {{many of his}} fellows, he had {{apparently}} accepted the new order of things with good grace, and had sworn fealty to Xodar, his new ruler; but I knew that he hated me, and I was sure that in his heart he envied and hated Xodar, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> had <b>kept</b> a watch upon his comings and goings, to the end that of late I had become convinced that he was occupied with some manner of intrigue.|$|R
5000|$|Johnson {{took the}} photo of the tornado while at the Southfield {{shopping}} center to pick up an ad from a store for his Enterprise Publication. According to a story in the Chicago American, Johnson, who always had his camera in his car, saw the tornado forming and ran to his car from where he took the photograph. Of the photo, Johnson said [...] "I opened the lens way up and shot. It was moving <b>so</b> fast <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> losing the funnel behind the buildings." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{some time}} the ground had been rougher and steeper, until I {{had been forced}} to scale a {{considerable}} height that had carried me from the glacier entirely. I was sure from my compass that I was following the right general direction, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> on.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Devilish little, I'm {{sorry to}} say,' replied Squeers. 'The money {{was paid for}} some six or eight year, and then it stopped. He had given an address in London, had this chap; {{but when it came}} to the point, of course nobody knowed {{anything}} about him. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> the lad out of--out of--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{at first}} they struck me as wonderful," [...] said the girl. [...] "They were such a novel {{invention}} that I went to see them from pure curiosity. But, afterward, the subjects presented in the pictures bored me. The drama pictures were cheap and common, the comedy scenes worse; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> away from the picture theatres." ...|$|E
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1938 season Middlesbrough played Stoke {{who then}} had the legendary Stanley Matthews on the right wing. The match report stated 'Stuart staying close to Matthews {{prevented}} the maestro performing his usual magic.' When questioned how he managed to achieve the feat he stated [...] "I respected Stanley's skill <b>so</b> <b>I</b> just <b>kept</b> my eye on the ball and shuffled him into the corner", this allowing the defence to be ready to manage any eventual cross.' ...|$|R
60|$|Thus, {{throughout}} {{the organization of}} the Oligarchy, our own organization, weblike and spidery, was insinuating itself. And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> was <b>kept</b> in touch with all that was happening in the world without. And furthermore, every one of our imprisoned leaders was in contact with brave comrades who masqueraded in the livery of the Iron Heel. Though Ernest lay in prison three thousand miles away, on the Pacific Coast, I was in unbroken communication with him, and our letters passed regularly back and forth.|$|R
5000|$|Valance {{departed}} Neighbours in 2002 {{to concentrate}} on her music career. She filmed her final scenes in August of that year. Valance said it took three takes to film her last scene. Of her departure, she said [...] "I've learnt <b>so</b> much. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> telling myself <b>I</b> wasn't going to cry, it's so sad to be leaving. I've made such good friends and learnt <b>so</b> much. When <b>I</b> started, I didn't know a thing." [...] In March 2005, {{it was announced that}} Valance would be reprising her role as Felicity for the show's 20th anniversary episode, [...] "Friends for Twenty Years".|$|R
