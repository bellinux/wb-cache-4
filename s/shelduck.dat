5|$|Much of the {{management}} work {{carried out in the}} nature reserve is aimed at encouraging ducks to breed, and small numbers of tufted duck (Aythya fuligula), common pochard (Aythya ferina), common <b>shelduck</b> (Tadorna tadorna) and gadwall raise broods most years. Recent breeding successes also include water rail (Rallus aquaticus) and Cetti's warbler (Cettia cetti).|$|E
5|$|Between {{the river}} {{mouth and the}} River Witham, a large expanse of {{saltmarsh}} provides breeding grounds for common redshank, Eurasian oystercatcher and reed bunting in the summer, and Eurasian wigeon, mallard, common <b>shelduck</b> and common teal in the winter. Birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on the flocks of linnet and twite, while the mudflats support dunlin, whimbrel, and bar-tailed godwit. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{island has}} a {{significant}} breeding colony of over 4,000 pairs of lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus), 400 pairs of herring gulls (Larus argentatus), 2pairs of great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus) and varying numbers of common <b>shelduck</b> (Tadorna tadorna) and Eurasian oystercatchers (Haematopodidae). The feeding habits of lesser black-backed gulls were studied in 1989, and it was shown that smaller clutches were laid than in previous years and that supplementary feeding did not increase egg or clutch size.|$|E

5|$|Many {{endemic species}} of Mauritius became extinct after {{the arrival of}} humans, so the {{ecosystem}} of the island is badly damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, but very little remains of them today, because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The dodo lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the flightless red rail, the broad-billed parrot, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian <b>shelduck,</b> the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink, and the Round Island burrowing boa. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and Réunion, but vanished from both islands. Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid, have also become extinct.|$|E

5|$|The Firth is an {{important}} area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats, shingle shorelines and saltmarsh. The last named, which is well developed on Alloa Inch, is typically dominated by saltmarsh rush, sea club-rush, sea aster and common saltmarsh-grass. The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of <b>shelduck,</b> knot, redshank, great crested grebe, teal and goldeneye. The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds. The Bass Rock has more than 150,000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world. When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which give off 152 tonnes of ammonia per year). The scientific names for this gannet, Sula bassana and Morus bassanus, are derived from the rock. The bird was traditionally known locally as the solan goose, and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species on the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, eider duck and numerous gulls.|$|E
25|$|Three {{bird species}} occur in internationally {{important}} numbers: common <b>shelduck,</b> pied avocet and black-tailed godwit. Other notable visitors include spoonbill, Sandwich tern and whimbrel. Once rare, little egrets are now seen regularly and in increasing numbers.|$|E
25|$|Internationally {{important}} {{numbers of}} Sandwich and little terns breed on the island, together with common and Arctic terns The marshes also support wintering wildfowl and waders, including <b>shelduck,</b> wigeon, teal and curlew. brent geese feed on sea lettuce and eelgrass, preferring the former when both are available. The {{average number of}} pink-footed geese in the five winters to 2009/10 was 22,764, far exceeding the international importance level of 2,700 birds.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, Branta rhuax {{from the}} Big Island of Hawaii, and a {{gigantic}} goose-like anatid from Oahu are known only from very incomplete, {{and in the}} former case much damaged, bone fragments. The former has been alleged to be a <b>shelduck,</b> but this was generally dismissed because of {{the damage to the}} material and biogeographic considerations. The long-legged Kauai bird, however, hints at the possibility of a former tadornine presence on the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Their {{feathers}} {{are excellent}} at shedding water due to special oils. Many of the ducks display sexual dimorphism, with the males being more brightly coloured than the females (although {{the situation is}} reversed in species such as the paradise <b>shelduck).</b> The swans, geese, and whistling-ducks lack sexually dimorphic plumage. Anatids are vocal birds, producing a range of quacks, honks, squeaks, and trumpeting sounds, depending on species; the female often has a deeper voice than the male.|$|E

25|$|Many coastal {{birds are}} {{frequently}} found in Rottnest. These include the pied cormorant, osprey, pied oystercatcher, silver gull, crested tern, fairy tern, bridled tern, rock parrot and the reef heron. The island salt lakes contain brine shrimp which support birds {{such as the}} red-necked avocet, banded stilt, ruddy turnstone, curlew sandpiper, red-capped dotterel, Australian <b>shelduck,</b> red-necked stint, grey plover, white-fronted chat, Caspian tern and the crested tern. Several pairs of osprey nest at Rottnest each year; one nest at Salmon Point {{is estimated to be}} 70 years old. Introduced peafowl are often seen near the main settlement.|$|E
500|$|There are no {{permanent}} human {{settlements in the}} region, though it has {{a large number of}} defence personnel who man the borders on both sides. A small number of nomadic Tibetan graziers or Dokpas [...] herd yak, sheep and pashmina-type goats in the region. There has been intense grazing pressure due to domestic and wild herbivores on the land. Yaks are found in these parts, and in many hamlets they serve as beasts of burden. The region around Nathu La contains many endangered species, including Tibetan gazelle, snow leopard, Tibetan wolf, Tibetan snowcock, lammergeier, raven, golden eagle, and ruddy <b>shelduck.</b> Feral dogs are considered a major hazard in this region. The presence of landmines in the area causes casualties among yak, nayan, kiang, and Tibetan wolf.|$|E
500|$|The Point juts {{into the}} sea on a north-facing coast, which means that migrant birds {{may be found in}} spring and autumn, {{sometimes}} in huge numbers when the weather conditions force them towards land. Numbers are relatively low in spring, but autumn can produce large [...] "falls", such as the hundreds of European robins on 1 October 1951 or more than 400 common redstarts, on 18 September 1995. The common birds are regularly accompanied by scarcer species like greenish warblers, great grey shrikes or Richard's pipits. Seabirds may be sighted passing the Point, and migrating waders feed on the marshes at this time of year. Vagrant rarities have turned up when the weather is appropriate, including a Fea's or Zino's petrel in 1997, a trumpeter finch in 2008, and an alder flycatcher in 2010. Ornithologist and pioneering bird photographer Emma Turner started ringing common terns on the Point in 1909, and the use of this technique for migration studies has continued since. A notable recovery was a Sandwich tern killed for food in Angola, and a Radde's warbler trapped for ringing in 1961 was only the second British record of this species at that time. In the winter, the marshes hold golden plovers and wildfowl including common <b>shelduck,</b> Eurasian wigeon, brent geese and common teal, while common scoters, common eiders, common goldeneyes and red-breasted mergansers swim offshore.|$|E
50|$|The namesake genus of the Tadorninae, Tadorna is {{very close}} to the Egyptian goose and its extinct {{relatives}} from the Madagascar region, Alopochen. While the classical <b>shelducks</b> form a group that is obviously monophyletic, the interrelationships of these, the aberrant common and especially raja <b>shelducks,</b> and the Egyptian goose were found to be poorly resolved by mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data; this genus may thus be paraphyletic.|$|R

40|$|Flying Steamer Duck Magellanic Flightless Steamer Duck Falkland Flightless Steamer Duck The South American steamer ducks have {{at times}} been {{included}} with the <b>shelducks,</b> but differ enough from them in structure and behavior {{to be regarded as}} a separate but closely related tribe. There are three species very similar in appearance; two are essentially flightless. All are found off the coasts of southern South America and the Falkland Islands, where they feed on mollusks and other marine invertebrates. The males differ slightly from females in their plumage and vocalizations, but in both sexes iridescent coloration is totally lacking and only a simple white speculum is present on the wings. Like the <b>shelducks,</b> however, they are highly aggressive during social display activities. The downy young to some extent resemble those of <b>shelducks,</b> but have less spotting and less contrasting coloration...|$|R
