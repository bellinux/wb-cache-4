40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} repetitive and iterative {{learning control}} design and analysis for back <b>stepping</b> <b>controlled</b> nonlinear systems. To precisely track periodic or finite duration trajectories for nonlinear systems, back <b>stepping</b> <b>control</b> is first designed to render closed loop stability and, in theory, asymptotic tracking performance. However, {{due to the}} sensitivity to the unmodelled dynamics plant variations, asymptotic tracking performance is usually not feasible. Thus, repetitive or learning control is applied over the back <b>stepping</b> <b>controlled</b> system to restore asymptotic tracking performance. This approach is applied to an electrohydraulic material testing system, in which the material specimen present substantial nonlinear force and displacement relationship. It will be shown that the back <b>stepping</b> <b>control</b> employs both feedback and feedforward actions to render linearized I/O plant and thus the outer loop repetitive and learning control design can {{be based on the}} compensated linear system. Experimental results will be given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

50|$|Using this approach, Moog built a {{range of}} signal-generating, signal-modifying and {{controller}} modules, each {{of which could be}} easily inter-connected to control or modify the functions and outputs of any other. The central component was the voltage-controlled oscillator, which generated the primary sound signal, capable of producing a variety of waveforms including sawtooth, square and sine waves. The output from the VCO could then be modified and shaped by feeding the signal into other modules such as voltage-controlled amplifiers, voltage-controlled filters, envelope generators, and ring modulators. Another customization as part of the Moog Modular Synthesizer is the sequencer, which provided a source of timed <b>step</b> <b>control</b> voltages that were programmed to create repetitive note patterns, without using the keyboard. The inputs and outputs of any module could be cross-linked with patch cords (using tip-sleeve ("mono") ¼-inch plugs) and, together with the module control knobs and switches, could create a nearly infinite variety of sounds and effects.|$|E

40|$|Recently [5, 6, 7] a {{discretization}} (in time) {{scheme for}} the transient even-parity neutron transport equation was successfully developed and {{implemented in the}} VARIANT/KIN 3 D code.
