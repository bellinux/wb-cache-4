5|$|This {{film was}} shot mainly at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England, {{and on his}} arrival at Southampton aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2, Cagney was mobbed by {{hundreds}} of fans. Cunard Line officials, who {{were responsible for the}} security at the dock, said they had never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like it, although they had experienced past visits by Marlon Brando and Robert Redford.|$|E
5|$|Blythe further {{testified that}} he was not under the {{influence}} of alcohol during the concert and that he had never used any drugs. Chris Adler, Lamb of God's drummer, {{testified that he}} had not <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe's aggressiveness is only a stage act. According to Adler, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well-read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people to climb the stage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Niven met Hjördis Paulina Tersmeden (née Genberg, 1919–1997), a {{divorced}} Swedish fashion model. He recounted their meeting:I had never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> so beautiful in my life—tall, slim, auburn hair, up-tilted nose, lovely {{mouth and the}} most enormous grey eyes I had ever seen. It really happened {{the way it does}} when written by the worst lady novelists... I goggled. I had difficulty swallowing and had champagne in my knees.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, a guest {{was stabbed}} {{critically}} by another guest. The Executive Director of Saint Francis House, Karen LaFrazia, {{said that this}} was a very rare occurrence and that in her tenure of more than a decade, she had never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like this and that the environment is safe and a haven for many hundreds of people every day. The people involved in the incident were not regular guests of Saint Francis House.|$|E
25|$|The second series, Ben Harper, {{husband and}} father to three {{different}} and often difficult children, has spent his working life as a dentist. Just {{as well as most}} of his life seems rather like pulling teeth. His wife Susan is usually busy showing foreign tourists around London, a place she knows much better than her own kitchen. Ben and Susan have been married happily enough to have three children. However, Ben has the feeling that most of the time his children seem to speak a different language. Nick (20) has persuaded his parents he would benefit from a gap year to see something of the world, but he has hardly <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> beyond the confines of the sofa. Janey (17) is into boys, fashion labels (expensive ones), and getting her own way. Michael (14) is the brightest of the trio. He is seriously into computers and not so seriously (yet) into girls.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Lawrence Toppman of The Charlotte Observer stated: [...] "I {{can safely}} say I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> as ridiculous as Live Free or Die Hard."

500|$|The {{problem of}} how exactly Anna would save Elsa at the film's climax was solved by story artist John Ripa.

500|$|Their {{first stop}} was a {{dilapidated}} shotgun house in Cleveland, in which 15 people resided. Holes {{were present in}} the flooring and roofing, and the only food in the refrigerator was a jar of peanut butter. One boy told Kennedy that all he had for breakfast and dinner was molasses, and that he didn't eat any lunch. Walking to the next house, Kennedy whispered to Edelman, [...] "I've been to third-world countries and I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like this." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} after World War I, Piłsudski attempted {{to build a}} government in a shattered country. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region's wealth by at least 10%. A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported: [...] "I have nowhere <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like the evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one's eye at almost every turn".|$|E

[...] He also stated that her style is [...] "...distinctly different you've <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> in the game until now.|$|E
500|$|Pastoral theologian Herbert Anderson {{has written}} that the child's {{perspective}} of reality in Mulberry Street can be challenging and seem subversive to an adult. He argues that Marco's internal {{story of what happened}} on his walk was not dishonest or rebellious, but a natural [...] "openness to constructing a world". [...] The child's untruthful response that he had not <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> interesting on Mulberry Street is not out of disrespect to the parent, but is Marco's attempt to reconcile his perspective with the authoritative, adult one of his father.|$|E

Wenger hailed the performance as [...] "edging nearer to perfection", adding it evoked {{memories of the}} Ajax team in the 1970s: [...] "We are playing great, 'Total Football'. Danger comes from everywhere." [...] Leeds manager Terry Venables agreed: [...] "Manchester United have been exceptional for 10 years – but I've not <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> as good as that." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool {{celebrated their}} victory by parading the trophy around Liverpool in an open-top {{double-decker}} bus {{the day after}} the final. They were cheered by approximately 1 million supporters, with an estimated 300,000 fans located around St George's Hall – the final destination of the parade. Business experts estimated that one in five workers took time off following the victory. It was also estimated that Liverpudlians drank around 10,000 bottles of champagne after the match, with supermarket chain Sainsbury's stating: [...] "We've never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like it. We would usually expect to sell this much champagne at Christmas".|$|E
