40|$|International audienceOne of {{the most}} {{widespread}} tools in the conservation of scavenger species is the provision of supplementary food. However, scientific studies on its effectiveness have been rarely conducted. Here, we present the first results of an experimental specific <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programme</b> applied from hatching to 45 – 60  days, aimed at increasing the breeding success of an obligate brood reducer, the threatened bearded vulture. We tested its effectiveness in the Spanish Pyrenees, the locale {{of the most}} important population of this species in the European Union, in which a regressive trend in breeding parameters has been observed in recent years. We compared the breeding success in nests with supplementary food to non-supplemented control nests. Supplementary food did not significantly increase global breeding success (supplemented nests, 0. 793 [*]±[*] 0. 193 chicks per pair with eggs hatched vs non-supplemented nests, 0. 771 [*]±[*] 0. 185) or the individual breeding performance of the territories (supplemented period, 0. 712 [*]±[*] 0. 307 vs non-supplemented period, 0. 642 [*]±[*] 0. 311). The similar values obtained suggest that the specific <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programme</b> applied during the chick-rearing period is apparently ineffective at increasing breeding success. The results suggest that, at least in the study area, factors that provoke breeding failure after hatching continue to operate independently of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programme.</b> Although more research on this subject is required, these preliminary conclusions should be taken into account by managers in order to optimise the investment of economic resources and to better prioritise the future establishment of alternative conservation actions...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES : Evaluate {{changes in}} {{underweight}} and wasting, feeding patterns, water use, sanitation, immunisation, disease episodes, deworming and vitamin A supplementation in children aged 6 - 23 months in returnee villages benefiting from a community-based <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programme</b> in northern Uganda. Community perceptions on {{the causes and}} effects of childhood malnutrition, the use of community volunteers, {{the involvement of the}} men in the promotion of child nutrition and changes in childhood nutrition and feeding practices were also assessed. DESIGN : Programme impact evaluation. SETTING : The study was carried out in the districts of Pader and Agago in northern Uganda. SUBJECTS : Children aged 6 - 23 months (207), and adult men and women. OUTCOME MEASURESutcome measures : Weight and mid-upper-arm circumference were used to determine underweight and wasting, respectively. Immunisation, deworming and vitamin A supplementation status was assessed. Oedema and morbidity or disease episodes were also determined. Community perceptions on the quality, utilisation and types of supplementary feeding services offered, understanding of malnutrition and the involvement of the men were also assessed. Finally, the impact of mother care groups and village health teams, as well as changes in child nutrition status and feeding, were assessed. RESULTS : The prevalence of wasting (11. 1 %) and underweight (22. 7 %) is higher than the baseline of 11 % and 17. 8 %, respectively. Eighty-six per cent of the children were still breastfeeding. A high percentage (79. 2 %) of children were exclusively breastfed. The largest proportion of children (42. 3 %) ate two times a day, and 55. 6 % of them consumed food from their own plates. Over three quarters (75. 8 %) and 93. 7 % of the children had received measles and diphtheria, pertussis and tuberculosis vaccines (DPT 3), respectively. Ninety-five per cent and 66. 7 % had received vitamin A supplements and deworming tablets, respectively. The water usage rate was 19. 2 l/person/day. Sixty per cent of the households had their own pit latrines. The programme was perceived to have improved the nutritional knowledge and feeding practices of the community. The use of volunteer mothers for nutrition education encouraged other community members to take childhood nutrition seriously. CONCLUSION : Childhood wasting and underweight rates have remained high in the two districts, despite an improvement in nutrition-related knowledge and practices. Advances in complementary feeding and related sanitation practices were recorded. An increase in vitamin A supplementation, with reductions in DPT 3 immunisation and deworming were observed at the end of this community-based <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programme.</b> Community volunteers, through the provision of education and the identification of malnourished children, were pivotal in changing nutrition knowledge and the attitudes of community members. The support of volunteers with savings, loans and seeds were important incentives when promoting nutrition. Given the reliance of the volunteers on incentives from the project, we are sceptical as to whether nutrition education and the screening of acutely malnourished children will continue in these communities post the project.

40|$|Introduction: Level of {{development}} in health and nutrition at district level is useful for planning intervention in less developed districts. Aims & Objectives : to develop composite index based on 12 variables to compare development within districts {{in the state of}} Madhya Pradesh. Material & Methods : Data collected by National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad during 2010 - 11 on nutritional status of rural children at district level in Madhya Pradesh was used. A total of 22, 895 children (Boys: 12379, Girls: 10516), were covered. Results: It was observed that Indore district rank 1 st as per composite index and Singrauli rank last in the district ranking. Three categories of districts were done based on percentile of composite index i. e less developed, developing and developed districts. It was observed that there was significant (p< 0. 01) trend in the prevalence of undernutrition among three set of districts. Similarly, significant (p< 0. 01) trend was observed in proportion of children participating regularly in ICDS <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programme,</b> use of sanitary latrine and iodized cooking salt among three sets of districts. C onclusions : Widespread disparity in health and nutrition was observed among the districts. It is quite important to examine the extent of improvements needed in different developmental indicators for enhancing the level {{of development}} of low developed districts. This will help the planners and administrators to readjust the resources for bringing about uniform development in the state. </p...|$|E
40|$|In a {{conservation}} context, food supplementation is a management tool used {{to reverse the}} decline of food-limited populations by means of positive changes in behaviour and ﬁtness that may be reﬂected in population parameters. The critically endangered Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus has suffered a dramatic decline {{primarily because of the}} severe drop of its main prey, the European wild rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus. To reverse this situation, a food supplementation pro- gramme has been implemented in Donana, south-west Spain, since 2002. In this study, we assess the utility of providing artiﬁcial food to reduce home-range (HR) size, and to increase productivity, survival and recruitment in a scenario of low lynx density, as compared with reference data from the same population in the absence of extra food. Food supplementation produced a signiﬁcant contraction of core areas, but not of complete lynx HRs. We did not detect any signiﬁcant change in productivity or dispersal rates, but supplementation could have helped transient adult lynx to settle down. The positive effects of food supplementation may have been partly countered by factors such as inbreeding, Allee effects and disease outbreaks, whose effects may have been exacerbated in this small lynx population. Food supplementation, however, proved useful to retain individuals, to keep range sizes within their normal range of values, thus maintaining spatial organization, and to allow lynx reproduction and kitten survival in areas with very low prey density. Therefore, we recommend keeping an extensive and intensive <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programme</b> until the density of wild rabbits will enable the viability of this endangered lynx population.

40|$|Resource {{clumping}} (prey hotspots) and intraspeciﬁc competition may interact to inﬂuence predator foraging behaviour. Optimal foraging {{theory suggests}} that predators should concentrate most of their foraging activity on prey hotspots, but this prediction has received limited empirical support. On the other hand, if prey concentration at hotspots is high enough to allow its use by several individuals, increased competition may impose constraints on foraging decisions of conspeciﬁcs, resulting in a temporal segregation {{in the use of}} shared resources. We investigated how artiﬁcial prey hotspots inﬂuence foraging behaviour in the Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus, and examined variations in the use of prey hotspots by individu- als with diﬀerent competitive abilities. All lynx, irrespective of their position in the competitive hierarchy, focused their activity on prey hotspots. Supplemented lynx concentrated higher proportions of active time on 100 m circular areas around hotspots than non-supplemented lynx did on any area of the same size. However, we found evidence for a dynamic temporal segregation, where inferior competitors may actively avoid the use of prey hotspots when dominants were present. Dynamic temporal segregation may operate in solitary and territorial predators as a mechanism to facilitate coexistence of conspeciﬁcs in the absence of opportunities for spatial segregation when they use extremely clumped resources.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of malnutrition among under- 5 -year-olds in Brazil fell {{by more than}} 60 % between 1975 and 1989. The benefits were smaller for population strata that were more affected by malnutrition in the 1970 s, i. e., children from the North and North-east regions and those from poor families in general. Regional and socioeconomic differentials in the {{prevalence of}} malnutrition therefore increased between 1975 and 1989. Trends in family income indicate extraordinary economic gains in the 1970 s, some losses in the 1980 s, and a modest net gain over the period 1975 - 89. The availability of sanitation, health, and education services, {{and the provision of}} preschool <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programmes</b> increased markedly in the 1970 s and 1980 s. Demographic trends were also positive, reducing the demand for services and programmes, increasing the economic efficiency of families, and concentrating the population in urban areas, where incomes, job opportunities, and social and material infrastructures are better. The observed nutritional improvement was therefore probably due to a moderate increase in family income associated with a substantial expansion in the provision of services and programmes, both of which were facilitated by favourable demographic trends. Also, the nutritional improvement was probably concentrated during the 1970 s, while little, if any, occurred after 1980; prospects for the 1990 s point to a stagnant situation. This is a reason for great concern particularly in the North and North-east regions of the country, where high rates of child malnutrition are still found...|$|R
40|$|A blanket <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programme</b> {{for young}} {{children}} was implemented for four months in five northern districts of Kenya from January 2010 because of fears of food insecurity exacerbated by drought. An attempt to evaluate {{the impact of the}} food on children’s anthropometric status was put in place in three districts. The main aim of the analysis was to assess the quality of the data on the cohort of children studied in the evaluation and to propose methods by which it could be improved to evaluate future blanket feeding programmes. Data on the name, age, sex, weight and height of a systematic sample of children recruited at 61 food distribution sites were collected at the first, second and third rounds and again at an extra, fifth food distribution, offered only to the evaluation subjects. Of the 3, 544 children enrolled, 483 (13. 63 %) did not collect a fifth ration. Of the 2, 640 children who were considered by their name to be the same at the first and fifth food distribution (13 % were different), data on only 902 children (34. 17 %) were considered acceptable based on their age (an arbitrary 63 months different) and their length or height (between. 21 or# 4 cm different) at the two instances they were seen. Data on nearly two thirds of children were of questionable quality. The main reasons for the poor quality data were inconsistencies in estimating age or because caretakers may have brought different children. Recommendations are made about how to improve data quality including ensuring that entry to a blanket feeding programme is clearly based on height, not age, to avoid misreporting age; careful identification of subjects at all contacts; and using well-trained, specialis...|$|E

We report an analysis of outcomes in a large programme of community management of acute malnutrition in the south of Lusaka. Over 3 years, 68, 707 assessments for undernutrition were conducted house-to-house, and children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) or moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) were enrolled into either Outpatient Therapeutic Programme (OTP) or <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Feeding</b> <b>Programme</b> (SFP) respectively. Case records were analysed using tabulation and unconditional logistic regression. 1, 859 children (889 boys, 970 girls; median age 16 months) with MAM (n = 664) or SAM (n = 1, 195) were identified. Of 1, 796 children whose parents consented to testing, 185 (10. 3 %) were HIV positive. Altogether 1, 163 (62. 6 %) were discharged as recovered from acute malnutrition.

Methods We defined MAM as mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of ≥ 11. 0 cm and < 12. 5 cm with no bilateral pitting oedema to include Ethiopian government and World Health Organisation cut-offs. We prospectively surveyed 884 children aged 6 - 59 months living with MAM in a rural area of Ethiopia not eligible for a <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programme.</b> Weekly home visits were made for seven months (28 weeks), covering the end of peak malnutrition through to the post-harvest period (the most food secure window), collecting anthropometric, socio-demographic and food security data. Results By {{the end of the study}} follow up, 32. 5 %(287 / 884) remained with MAM, 9. 3 % (82 / 884) experienced at least one episode of SAM (MUAC < 11 cm and/or bilateral pitting oedema), and 0. 9 % (8 / 884) died. Only 54. 2 % of the children recovered with no episode of SAM by the end of the study. Of those who developed SAM half still had MAM at the end of the follow up period. The median (interquartile range) time to recovery was 9 (4 - 15) weeks. Children with the lowest MUAC at enrolment had a significantly higher risk of remaining with MAM and a lower chance of recovering. Conclusions Children with MAM during the post-harvest season in an area not eligible for SFP experience an extremely high incidence of SAM and a low recovery rate. Not having a targeted nutrition-specific intervention to address MAM in this context places children with MAM at excessive risk of adverse outcomes. Further preventive and curative approaches should urgently be considered. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|In the Horn of Africa, scurvy is {{a serious}} public health problem for {{refugees}} who are dependent on standard relief food (cereals, legumes, and oil). To assess the risk factors and to quantify the potential magnitude of scurvy among these displaced communities, we reviewed data collected from 1985 to 1987 by relief programmes in five refugee camps in Somalia {{and one in the}} Sudan. Outbreaks of clinical scurvy occurred among refugees in all the camps from 3 to 4 months after their arrival. The incidence of scurvy in two camps was, respectively, 14 % over a period of 4 months and 19. 8 % over a period of 18 months. Prevalences of scurvy estimated from random population samples in the six study camps ranged from 13. 6 % to 44 %. The risk of developing scurvy increased significantly with the length of time that refugees had been in the camps and was also significantly higher among those who were older and among females, particularly those of childbearing age. The prevalence of scurvy among refugees was similar, irrespective of whether or not they had attended <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programmes.</b> The control measures that were implemented had a moderate and slow impact on the disease. In both Somalia and the Sudan the relief food distributed to the refugees was almost completely deficient in vitamin C, while the environment where the camps were located precluded an adequate supply of fresh food.

40|$|Stunting and {{micronutrient}} malnutrition are persistent {{public health}} problems in refugee populations. UNHCR and its partner organisations implement blanket <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programmes</b> using {{a range of}} special nutritional products as one approach to address these issues. The evidence base for the efficacy and effectiveness of a small quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement, Nutributter®, in reducing stunting and anaemia is limited. Secondary data {{analysis was used to}} assess the effectiveness of Nutributter® distribution on anaemia and stunting in children aged 6 - 23 months (programme target group) and 6 - 59 months (the standard age group sampled in routine nutrition surveys). Analysis was conducted using routine pre and post-intervention cross-sectional nutrition survey data collected between 2008 - 2011 in five refugee camps in Kenya and Djibouti. Changes in total anaemia (Haemoglobin< 110 g/L), anaemia categories (mild, moderate and severe), and stunting (height-for-age z-score <- 2) were explored using available data on the Nutributter® programme and contextual factors. A significant reduction in the prevalence of anaemia in children aged 6 - 23 months and 6 - 59 months was seen in four of five, and in all five camps, respectively (p< 0. 05). Reductions ranged from 12. 4 to 23. 0, and 18. 3 to 29. 3 percentage points in each age group. Improvements were largely due to reductions in moderate and severe anaemia and occurred where the prevalence of acute malnutrition was stable or increasing. No change in stunting was observed in four of five camps. The replicability of findings across five sites strongly suggests that Nutributter® distribution was associated with a reduction in anaemia, but not stunting, among refugee children in the Horn of Africa.

With the newly introduced World Health Organization growth standards, more children at an early stage of malnutrition will be treated following the dietary protocols as for severe acute malnutrition, including ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF). We compared the effectiveness of RUTF and a corn/soy-blend (CSB) -based pre-mix for the treatment of MAM in the <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programmes</b> (SFPs) supported by Médecins Sans Frontières, located in the Zinder region (south of Niger). Children measuring 65 to < 110 cm, newly admitted with MAM [weight-for-height (WHM%) between 70 % and < 80 % of the NCHS median] were randomly allocated to receive either RUTF (Plumpy'Nut®, 1000 kcal day(- 1)) or a CSB pre-mix (1231 kcal day(- 1)). Other interventions were similar in both groups (e. g. weekly family ration and ration at discharge). Children were followed weekly up to recovery (WHM% ≥ 85 % for 2 consecutive weeks). In total, 215 children were recruited in the RUTF group and 236 children in the CSB pre-mix group with an overall recovery rate of 79. 1 and 64. 4 %, respectively (p < 0. 001). There was no evidence for a difference between death, defaulter and non-responder rates. More transfers to the inpatient Therapeutic Feeding Centre (I-TFC) were observed in the CSB pre-mix group (19. 1 %) compared to the RUTF group (9. 3 %) (p = 0. 003). The average weight gain up to discharge was 1. 08 g kg(- 1) day(- 1) higher in the RUTF group [95 % confidence interval: 0. 46 - 1. 70] and the length of stay was 2 weeks shorter in the RUTF group (p < 0. 001). For the treatment of childhood MAM in Niger, RUTF resulted in a higher weight gain, a higher recovery rate, a shorter length of stay and a lower transfer rate to the I-TFC compared to a CSB pre-mix.

40|$|The study {{set out to}} {{investigate}} the challenges faced by NGOs in carrying out supplementary feeding programmes in Zimbabwe’s rural areas. CARE and PLAN International in Zimbabwe were the two NGOs used as case studies and their operations in the Lower Gweru district of the Midlands Province Zimbabwe provided the empirical data for this study. This study was principally qualitative in nature as it sought to provide an in-depth analysis of the main challenges that NGOs face when carrying out supplementary feeding programmes {{in the rural areas}} of Zimbabwe. For the purpose of collecting data the study relied on Focus Group Discussions, in-depth interviews with key informants and document study. The key informants included Country Directors, Programme and Field officers at both CARE and PLAN International who had intimate knowledge of some of the challenges that their supplementary feeding programmes faced. Challenges that faced CARE and Plan International’s supplementary feeding programmes were categorized into two themes, internal and external organizational challenges. Internally the study revealed that the NGOs were unable to retain critical personnel such as nutritionists and programme officers. It also emerged from the study that field officers were involved in the thefts of food meant for the supplementary feeding programmes. The management of the supplementary feeding programmes was made difficult by lack of adequate information about the target beneficiaries. Further the study noted that there were contestations {{when it came to the}} selection of the beneficiaries of the programme. It was also found that during the rainy season it was difficult to 8 avail food timeously to the beneficiaries of the supplementary feeding programmes. It emerged from the study that supplementary feeding programmes were victims of political interference as the government and war veterans were suspicious that the programmes were being used to influence the voting behavior of the recipients. The global financial crisis also limited the capacity of the donors to continue availing substantial amounts of money for food procurement. As part of the broader strategy to increase the effectiveness of the NGOs in carrying supplementary feeding programmes this study recommended that NGOs should re-strategize on how they remunerate key personnel such as nutritionists. The NGOs through their mother body NANGO should constantly engage government so that there is a good working relationship supportive of poverty reduction through <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programme...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} {{movement patterns}} and rhythms of activity of a top predator, the Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus, a mesopredator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes, and their shared principal prey, the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, {{in relation to}} moon phases. Because the three species are mostly nocturnal and crepuscular, we hypothesized that the shared prey would reduce its activity at most risky moon phases (i. e. during the brightest nights), but that fox, an intraguild prey of lynx, would avoid lynx activity peaks at the same time. Rabbits generally moved further from their core areas on darkest nights (i. e. new moon), using direct movements which minimize predation risk. Though rabbits responded to the increased predation risk by reducing their activity during the full moon, this response may require several days, and the moon effect we observed on the rabbits had, therefore, a temporal gap. Lynx activity patterns may be at least partially mirroring rabbit activity: around new moons, when rabbits moved furthest and were more active, lynxes reduced their travelling distances and their movements were concentrated in the core areas of their home ranges, which generally correspond to areas of high density of rabbits. Red foxes were more active during the darkest nights, when both the conditions for rabbit hunting were the best and lynxes moved less. On the one hand, foxes increased their activity when rabbits were further from their core areas and moved with more discrete displacements; on the other hand, fox activity {{in relation to the}} moon seemed to reduce dangerous encounters with its intraguild predator.

40|$|The common {{marmoset}} is {{the most}} frequently used New World primate in laboratory research and testing. In the UK, their use is strictly controlled by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, which is underpinned by the principles of humane science: Replacement, Reduction and Refinement. Despite their use, {{there are a number of}} problems associated with the breeding of marmosets, including low dam longevity and increasing litter sizes. Large litters have led to high infant mortality and the need for human intervention to improve infant survival, which involves removal from the family for substantial periods of time. Previous research in a range of primate species shows that early life family separation is associated with numerous adverse behavioural and physiological effects. This project therefore sought to systematically investigate the effects of breeding and infant rearing practices, integrating a number of measures to assess the welfare of laboratory- housed marmosets. 	Potential predictors of dam longevity and litter size were first identified in three captive UK colonies, over four decades. Dam longevity was found to be approximately 6 years, with heavier dams living longer, but overall there was no consistent improvement in longevity over the decades. As longevity varied widely between colonies and over time, environment may be one of the most important factors. Approximately half of all births at each colony were litters larger than two, and these larger litters had greater infant mortality. Only dam weight at conception was useful in predicting litter size, with heavier dams producing larger litters. 	The consequences of large litters and early separation from the family for supplementary feeding were then investigated. Although twins had lower body weight than 2 stays (two infants remaining with the family after death of the other littermate/s) and supplementary fed triplets, they also had the fewest health problems. There was also some evidence that animals from larger litters were more at risk of suffering from extreme low weight. Some minor differences were found in behavioural development between litter sizes. Singleton infants received more rejective rearing, while 2 stays received more protective rearing, perhaps following the loss of an infant. While twin infants gained independence earlier than singletons or 2 stays, they did not appear to cope better with stress in adulthood, displaying more significant increases in stress-related behaviour following the routine stressor of capture and weighing, compared to 2 stays and supplementary fed triplets. While overall cortisol unexpectedly decreased from baseline to post capture, there were only significant fluctuations in 2 stay marmosets. Instead, there were some increases in positive behaviour in supplementary fed triplets following the stressor, suggesting enhanced coping ability. However, in another group of supplementary fed triplets, there were subtle increases in depressive-like symptoms, measured using cognitive bias and preference tests, suggesting a reduced expectation of and interest in rewards. There were however no differences between family-reared and supplementary fed marmosets in time to learn a visual discrimination task, or in responses to temperament tests. Therefore, while it was hypothesised that early family separation would have adverse developmental consequences, there were actually very little differences between marmosets of different litter sizes and rearing backgrounds, across the range of measures. Results suggest that the current <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>programme,</b> along with a regular human socialisation programme, minimises any potential negative effects. However, we should always be finding ways to improve the lives of animals in our care. Possible Refinements include reducing dam weight to increase twin births and improve infant survival, and training to allow supplementary feeding on the carrier’s back, to prevent infant separation and reduce disruption to the family. These Refinements could reduce fear and allow monkeys to become more resilient to the laboratory environment...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSupplementary feeding is a common, but controversial, tool in {{wildlife}} management, {{because it}} can benefit both humans and wildlife (e. g., increased wildlife densities), but has certain downsides (e. g., increased disease transmission). For species that are often involved in human-wildlife conflicts, two opposing paradigms with respect to <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> exist, i. e., (i) that <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> is efficient to lure animals away from undesired places (i. e., diversionary feeding; hypothesis 1), and (ii) that <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> stimulates ‘nuisance’ behavior (i. e., increased tolerance for humans and selection for human facilities; hypothesis 2). We formulated an alternative hypothesis (hypothesis 3); i. e., that behavioral variation among individuals dilutes population-wide, general patterns with respect to <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> Based on GPS relocation data and resource selection functions, we show that neither of the two opposing management paradigms (hypothesis 1 and 2) hold in a particularly ‘conflict rich’ species, the brown bear (Ursus arctos), because individual variation in selection behavior with respect to <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> diluted population-wide patterns (hypothesis 3), even under very different environmental contexts (Sweden vs. Slovenia; i. e., different human and bear population density, history and intensity of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding,</b> topography, etc.).

One hundred and seventy ostriches were randomly allocated to four groups and kept on irrigated lucerne pasture with or without <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> from approximately 58 kg to a target weight of 95 kg. The ostriches rotationally grazed lucerne pasture at one of two stocking rates, i. e. 15 birds/ha or 10 birds/ha and were fed one of two levels of supplement i. e. 0 g or 800 g feed/d formulated according to the nutrient requirements of the relevant group of birds. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. There was no interaction between the <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> and stocking rate regarding mean live weight at 54 weeks of age and feed conversion ration (FCR). Data were provided as the two main effects of level of supplementation and stocking rate. Significant differences in mean live weight at 54 weeks of age and FCR of the birds were observed between the different levels of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed.</b> The parameters measured for the two different stocking rates used in this study (10 birds/ha vs. 15 birds/ha) did not differ from each other and did not influence either mean live weight at 54 weeks of age, average daily gain (ADG) or FCR. The two groups which received 800 g supplementary feed/d reached slaughter weight (95 kg) within the set of 54 weeks of grazing for the trial, while the two groups which received no <b>supplementary</b> <b>feed</b> did not achieve slaughter weight by 54 weeks on the pasture.
