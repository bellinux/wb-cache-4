5|$|Back country skis: Designed for ski touring {{on natural}} snow conditions. Recommended lengths are between 150 and 195 centimeters for adult skiers, {{depending}} on {{height and weight}} of the user. Back country skis are typically heavier and wider than classic and skate skis; they often have metal edges for better grip on hard snow; and their greater <b>sidecut</b> helps to carve turns.|$|E
5|$|The {{geometry}} of a back country ski {{depends on its}} purpose—skis suited for forested areas where loose powder can predominate may be shorter and wider than those selected for open, exposed areas where compacted snow may prevail. <b>Sidecut</b> on Telemark skis promotes turning in forest and rugged terrain. Width and short length aid turning in loose and deep snow. Longer, narrower and more rigid skis with sharp edges are suited for snow that has been compacted by wind or freeze-thaw. Touring ski design may represent a general-purpose compromise among these different ski conditions, plus being acceptable for use in groomed tracks. Traction may come from a textured or waxed grip zone, as with classic skis, or from ski skins, which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards.|$|E

50|$|As {{shown in}} the flow diagram, the {{overhead}} distillate fraction from the distillation column is naphtha. The fractions removed {{from the side of}} the distillation column at various points between the column top and bottom are called <b>sidecuts.</b> Each of the <b>sidecuts</b> (i.e., the kerosene, light gas oil and heavy gas oil) is cooled by exchanging heat with the incoming crude oil. All of the fractions (i.e., the overhead naphtha, the <b>sidecuts</b> and the bottom residue) are sent to intermediate storage tanks before being processed further.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} single-case study was to {{investigate}} the effect of 6 weeks’ kettlebell training on the neuromuscular risk profile for ACL injury in a high-risk athlete returning to sport after ACL reconstruction. A female elite soccer player (age 21 years) with no previous history of ACL injury went through neuromuscular screening as measured by EMG preactivity of vastus lateralis and semitendinosus during a standardized <b>sidecutting</b> maneuver. Subsequently, the player experienced a noncontact ACL injury. The player was screened again following postreconstruction rehabilitation, then underwent 6 -week kettlebell training, and was subsequently screened again at 6 -week follow-up. Prior to and after postreconstruction rehabilitation the player demonstrated a neuromuscular profile during <b>sidecutting</b> known to increase the risk for noncontact ACL injury, that is, reduced EMG preactivity for semitendinosus and elevated EMG preactivity for vastus lateralis. Subsequently, the 6 -week kettlebell training increased semitendinosus muscle preactivity during <b>sidecutting</b> by 38 percentage points to a level equivalent to a neuromuscular low-risk profile. An ACL rehabilitated female athlete with a high-risk neuromuscular profile changed to low-risk in response to 6 weeks of kettlebell training. Thus, short-term kettlebell exercise with documented high levels of medial hamstring activation was found to transfer into high medial hamstring preactivation during a <b>sidecutting</b> maneuver...|$|R
50|$|Recreational {{skiing is}} usually done at speeds in range between 5 m/s and 15 m/s with average turn radius {{of less than}} 15 m. Accordingly, <b>sidecuts</b> of modern {{recreational}} skis are calculated for turn radius of approximately 7 to 15 m.|$|R
2500|$|Freestyle: Generally shorter with {{moderate}} to soft flex. [...] Freestyle snowboards have a mirror shovel {{at each end}} of the board. Freestyle snowboards usually have low-backed bindings. [...] Incorporates a deep <b>sidecut</b> for quick/tight turning. [...] Used in the pipe and in the park on various jumps and terrain features including boxes, rails, and urban features.|$|E
2500|$|Width – The width is {{typically}} {{measured at the}} waist of the board, since the nose and tail width varies with the <b>sidecut</b> and taper. Freestyle boards are up to [...] wide, to assist with balance. Alpine boards are typically [...] wide, although they can be as narrow as [...] Most folks ride boards in the [...] range. Riders with larger feet (US size 10 and larger) may have problems with narrower boards, as the rider's toes and/or heels may extend {{over the edge of}} the board, and interfere with the board's ability to make turns once it is set on edge, or 'get hung up on the snow.' This is called toe/heel-drag, and can be cured by either choosing a wider board ( [...] or more), adjusting the stance angle, or a combination of the two.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sidecut</b> - Since {{the boards}} uniformly flex, {{they do not}} need as {{dramatic}} (small) of a <b>sidecut</b> radius as the classic snowboard. The DES <b>sidecut</b> radius is equivalent to the radii used by parabolic skiis, 14m. Also, the narrow width increases the <b>sidecut</b> length on the order of 10-15 cm.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The project {{aimed to}} {{implement}} neuromuscular training during a full soccer and handball league season and to experimentally analyze the neuromuscular adaptation mechanisms elicited by this training during a standardized <b>sidecutting</b> maneuver {{known to be}} associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Design: The players were tested before and after 1 season without implementation of the prophylactic training and subsequently before and after a full season with the implementation of prophylactic training. Participants: A total of 12 female elite soccer players and 8 female elite team handball players aged 266 3 years {{at the start of the}} study. Intervention: The subjects participated in a specific neuromuscular training program previously shown to reduce non-contact ACL injury. Methods: Neuromuscular activity at the knee joint, joint angles at the hip and knee, and ground reaction forces were recorded during a <b>sidecutting</b> maneuver. Neuromuscular activity in the prelanding phase was obtained 10 and 50 ms before foot strike on a force plate and at 10 and 50 ms after foot strike on a force plate. Results: Neuromuscular training markedly increased prelanding activity and landing activity electromyography (EMG) of the semi-tendinosus (P, 0. 05), while quadriceps EMG activity remained unchanged. Conclusions: Neuromuscular training increased EMG activity for the medial hamstring muscles, thereby decreasing the risk of dynamic valgus. This observed neuromuscular adaptation during <b>sidecutting</b> could potentially reduce the risk for non-contact ACL injury...|$|R

40|$|Fatigue {{has been}} {{observed}} to affect lower extremity mechanics during the cutting maneuver. However, {{there is a lack}} of research examining the effect of fatigue and limb dominance on lower extremity mechanics during unanticipated <b>sidecutting.</b> Objectives: This research sought to assess mechanical differences pre- and post-fatigue and with respect to limb dominance. Design: Repeated measures. Methods: Thirteen female collegiate soccer and field hockey players performed right and left unanticipated <b>sidecutting</b> following the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery test (Yo-Yo IR), a two minute treadmill run at a predicted VO 2 max, and maximum vertical jumps. Mechanical measures of ankle, knee, and hip motion were obtained during the stance phase of the cut. Repeated measures 2 x 2 ANOVAs were performed to look at fatigue and limb differences. Alpha level set a priori at 0. 05. Results: At initial contact and peak stance, significant changes pre- to post-fatigue were observed. At initial contact there was a reduction in knee flexion angles along with increased ankle dorsiflexion angles postfatigue. At peak stance: increased knee adductor moments post-fatigue; greater ankle eversion moments on the dominant limb (DL) as well as increased eversion moments post-fatigue for both limbs. There was a differential effect of fatigue on peak hip abduction angles and hip internal rotation angles at initial contact which were altered in the DL only; decreased hip adductor moments occurred post-fatigue as well as decreased power absorption. Conclusions: Results from this study indicate that lower extremity mechanics are altered as an effect of fatigue such that injury risk may be elevated.

50|$|<b>Sidecut</b> is {{the subtle}} {{hourglass}} {{shape of the}} ski, viewed from the top. Skis have had some <b>sidecut</b> since before 1808, when it was invented by Norwegian artisans.

5000|$|The {{inhabitants}} of this joined settlement chose the name Toledo, [...] "but {{the reason for}} this choice is buried in a welter of legends. One recounts that Washington Irving, who was traveling in Spain at the time, suggested the name to his brother, a local resident; this explanation ignores the fact that Irving returned to the United States in 1832. Others award the honor to Two Stickney, son of the major who quaintly numbered his sons and named his daughters after States. The most popular version attributes the naming to Willard J. Daniels, a merchant, who reportedly suggested Toledo because it 'is easy to pronounce, is pleasant in sound, and there is no other city of that name on the American continent.'"Despite Toledo's efforts, the canal built the final terminus in Manhattan, 1/2 mi to the north of Toledo, because it was closer to Lake Erie. As a compromise, the state placed two <b>sidecuts</b> before the terminus, one in Toledo at Swan Creek and another in Maumee, about 10 miles to the southwest.|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} oil has {{increased}} considerably since its first discovery. Consequently, all of the reservoirs that were easy to access and/or explore have already been discovered. To overcome this challenge, the industry {{had to find a}} way to find new wells to explore, wells that were previously judged as non-economical, due to either their location or low porosity/permeability. For those reasons, the industry turned to directional wells, facilitated by the advances in technology. An important part of building a successful directional well is correctly predicting the well path. The objective of the present study is to analyze the influence of WOB, ROP, RPM and side load on the steerability of a PDC bit, bringing the work done by Ernst, Pastusek and Lutes (2007) to a horizontal set up and analyzing the response of MSE while <b>sidecutting.</b> Findings suggest how much of an influence the drilling parameters have on steering the bit, and the knowledge of how they affect the set up used during drilling can be a fundamental tool when creating a well path. The tests were conducted on a horizontal test rig, built by the Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A&M University, using 8 ksi average compressive strength samples. During the tests, modifications had to be made to the rig in order to accommodate the demands of a petroleum drilling operation. An innovative system was installed to measure shaft deflection through a HD Webcam, turning distance in the pixels from the images captured into real life distance. Through that system it was possible to back calculate the side load being applied to the system, controlling it in real time. The results showed that two parameters were the most influential on the <b>sidecutting</b> angle of a PDC bit: side load and RPM. Side load was even more significant for lower values, where an increase is much more abrupt. ROP is also expected to have a smaller influence, and it was observed for the sample with the highest RPM. MSE showed an expected response, being opposite to the side load. The results observed were very similar to the ones found by Ernst, Pastusek and Lutes (2007), thus being possible to conclude that when drilling a vertical well, the bit will respond in a similar manner to the changes in drilling parameters as it would in a vertical well...|$|R
40|$|Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) {{injuries}} {{are among the}} most common injuries incurred by both recreational and professional athletes. ACL injuries often occur during popular contact sports like basketball, football, volleyball and baseball, and non-contact activities like aerobics, jogging and running. Non-contact actions like jumping, sprinting and <b>sidecutting</b> that involve sudden or rapid changes in motion may lead to ACL injuries. At the instance of an injury, the knee joint muscles and ligaments typically undergo extremely high loads. The ACL, which {{is an integral part of}} the knee joint undergo high strain rates and rapid energy absorption, and consequently get injured. As has been shown by others, ACL injury is related to a number of dynamic variables of the knee joint. An important observation made in recent years is that recreational (also professional) female athletes have higher incidences of noncontact ACL injuries than males 33, 35. The primary focus of this study was to determine effects of several dynamic variables, associated with both knee and ACL, during normal recreational drop-jump activities performed by young female athletes. Subjects recruited were eleven young adult female recreational athletes who felt comfortable participating in the drop-jump activities, from heights of 30, 40 and 50 cm. Using a simulation environment to recreate the trials, changes in ACL load and strain were observed along with several dynamic variables related to ACL load and strain, among which the three most important were, 1. knee flexion, 2. knee valgus (abduction) which may be accompanied by increased internal rotation, and, 3. flexor to extensor muscle recruitment ratios, i. e., the co-contraction of flexor and extensor muscles. Observations from the above simulations formed the basis of the final step involving forward dynamic simulation, where the knee joint was subject to higher valgus by decreasing the distance between the knees (medial translation). Significant changes to ACL load and strain were seen in the added medial translation simulations compared to the simulations from the original jumps. Mean fiber strain for the additional valgus simulation increased from 8. 82 ± 0. 08 % to 11. 82 ± 0. 04 % for the right ACL and from 8. 18 ± 0. 08 % to 11. 34 ± 0. 06 % for the left. Mean ACL tensile force increased from 1058. 19 ± 2. 04 N to 1102. 19 ± 1. 86 N for the right ACL and from 1056. 77 ± 12. 36 N to 1099. 99 ± 2. 02 N for the left. Average peak (from eleven subjects) ACL tensile force increased from 1165. 36 ± 123. 83 N to 1197. 07 ± 129. 11 N for the right ACL and from 1160. 64 ± 121. 32 N to 1193. 11 ± 130. 16 N for the left...|$|R
5000|$|Snowboards and skiboards have {{generally}} {{had much more}} <b>sidecut</b> than alpine skis, roughly similar in layout to a parabolic ski. These designs evolved independently and were engineered from the start to select a design that produced smooth turns. Alpine skiing had previously been based on a skidding style of turns known as [...] "stemming" [...] that did not require much (or any) <b>sidecut,</b> and did not experiment with other designs as styles changed. Snowboards had to invent their equipment and techniques fresh, and found the deep <b>sidecut</b> was best through experimentation.|$|E

50|$|Many ski vendors allow {{selection}} of skis by turning radius. For a racing slalom ski, {{this can be}} as low as 12 metres and for Super-G it is normally 33 metres.Sidecut {{is the extent to}} which a ski or snowboard is narrower at the waist than at the tips. It is the arcing, hourglass-like curve that runs along a ski’s edges from tip to tail. This curve dictates how skis turn: the deeper the curve, the tighter the turn. Straighter skis with less <b>sidecut</b> have a larger turning radius and are more stable at high speeds. The <b>sidecut</b> radius is the radial measurement of the curve that matches the inner curvature of the ski, snowboard, or skiboard. For instance, with a radial <b>sidecut,</b> a circle with a particular radius will perfectly fit the curvature of the <b>sidecut.</b> This particular radius is the given specification from the manufacturer. However, it is not necessary that the radius be constant. Mathematical functions, such as a parabola or a clothoid, are often used to describe the curvature of a <b>sidecut.</b> Also, multiple radii are stitched together in a piecewise fashion as well.|$|E
50|$|Different {{types of}} skis have {{different}} sidecuts. Skis with drastic sidecuts {{tend to make}} quicker sharper turns and have a smaller turn radius. For example a world cup slalom ski would have an extremely large tip (probably around 120 mm) a narrow waist (in around 60mm) and a large tail (slightly narrower than the tip). The drastic shape of this ski would allow it to make extremely quick turns (radius between 11m and 14m) without skidding. The disadvantage to a pronounced <b>sidecut</b> is that the ski will be less stable at high speeds, preferring short, quick turns. Also, skis with a drastic <b>sidecut</b> will perform poorly in moguls. Most skis have a moderate amount of <b>sidecut.</b> This allows reasonably fast turns (radius around 17m on most skis) while still maintaining some stability at higher speeds. Another possibility is a very slight <b>sidecut.</b> This is commonly found on giant slalom skis and competition level mogul skis. The straighter <b>sidecut</b> allows skis to make long, fast, highly stable turns (radius around 30m for giant slalom, even more for most mogul skis). In mogul skis, the narrow width, straighter <b>sidecut,</b> and light weight allow the ski to be maneuvered through the tight troughs in the bumps. Jumping skis are very wide and have virtually parallel sides, as the ski jumper is more concerned about maintaining a fast and straight trajectory, and not turning at all.|$|E
50|$|Alpine skis have {{undergone}} three distinct changes in <b>sidecut</b> design. The earliest skis from the 1800s {{all the way}} to modern examples in the late 1990s featured a very small amount of <b>sidecut</b> that produced a ski that was almost rectangular in profile as seen from the top. Starting with the Elan SCX in 1995, and very rapidly thereafter, these designs dramatically increased <b>sidecut,</b> a design known as the parabolic ski, or later known as a shaped ski. Shaped skis ruled the hills from about 1997 to 2010, when the rocker ski design of much greater width began to appear in force. From about 2012 on the rocker design dominated ski design, with shaped skis being found primarily in beginner equipment.|$|E

50|$|A {{radical change}} in design did not occur until the mid-1970s {{introduction}} of the first modern snowboards. With no previous designs to set the mould, snowboard designers had to experiment {{to find the right}} layout. The 1975 Burton Backhill had a 17 mm <b>sidecut,</b> giving the board a very short turning radius. The Backhill was extremely low-tech in comparison to contemporary ski designs, consisting largely of a sheet of plywood. A contemporary ski's torsion box design greatly improved torsional stiffness and would allow even greater <b>sidecut</b> to be effective. But in spite of the snowboard demonstrating that modern skis could carry much wider sidecuts, and that such a <b>sidecut</b> resulted in excellent turn performance, little came of this development. The snowboard market was ignored by the major ski companies through the 1970s and 80s.|$|E
50|$|In any event, wooden skis of {{this era}} {{did not offer}} much {{torsional}} stiffness; when rolled on-edge by the skier's boots, the tips and tails of the ski would tend to twist {{in the opposite direction}} in order to lay flatter on the snow.

Hiatt and Groswold's experiment required such a deep <b>sidecut</b> that the waist had little vertical stiffness, another problem for the design.|$|E
