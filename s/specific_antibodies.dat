5|$|Most people {{infected}} with HIV develop <b>specific</b> <b>antibodies</b> (i.e. seroconvert) within three to twelve {{weeks of the}} initial infection. Diagnosis of primary HIV before seroconversion is done by measuring HIV-RNA or p24 antigen. Positive results obtained by antibody or PCR testing are confirmed either by a different antibody or by PCR.|$|E
5|$|Detection of {{particular}} antibodies {{is a very}} common form of medical diagnostics, and applications such as serology depend on these methods. For example, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis, a titer of antibodies directed against Epstein-Barr virus or Lyme disease is estimated from the blood. If those antibodies are not present, either the person is not infected or the infection occurred {{a very long time}} ago, and the B cells generating these <b>specific</b> <b>antibodies</b> have naturally decayed.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{team from}} New York {{described}} detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some <b>specific</b> <b>antibodies</b> against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus {{so that it is}} totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser.|$|E
40|$|Passive {{immunization}} of rats with homologous anti-sheep erythrocyte serum markedly inhibits {{the primary}} antibody response to sheep erythrocytes. Furthermore, unresponsiveness to sheep erythrocytes induced {{by a single}} passive immunization is sustained by weekly injections of sheep erythrocytes (1). The mechanism producing sustained immunological unresponsiveness in adult animals by this simple procedure has not been elucidated. Experiments to be reported in this paper suggest that <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> adsorbed onto or incorporated into potential antibody-forming cells inhibits these cells from forming <b>specific</b> <b>antibody.</b> Antibody does not have this effect on cells from actively immunized rats. Thus, the formation of <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> may provide a homeostatic or "feed-back " mechanism which controls or limits production of <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> to {{that portion of the}} antibody-forming system previously stimulated by the antigen. This mechanism may account in part for immunological unresponsiveness produced in mature animals by various procedures...|$|R

5|$|When the {{adaptive}} immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus, it produces <b>specific</b> <b>antibodies</b> that bind to the virus and often render it non-infectious. This is called humoral immunity. Two types of antibodies are important. The first, called IgM, is highly effective at neutralising viruses but is produced by {{the cells of the}} immune system only for a few weeks. The second, called IgG, is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past. IgG antibody is measured when tests for immunity are carried out.|$|E
5|$|<b>Specific</b> <b>antibodies</b> are {{produced}} by injecting an antigen into a mammal, such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, sheep, or horse for large quantities of antibody. Blood isolated from these animals contains polyclonal antibodies—multiple antibodies that bind to the same antigen—in the serum, which can now be called antiserum. Antigens are also injected into chickens for generation of polyclonal antibodies in egg yolk. To obtain antibody that is specific for a single epitope of an antigen, antibody-secreting lymphocytes are isolated from the animal and immortalized by fusing them with a cancer cell line. The fused cells are called hybridomas, and will continually grow and secrete antibody in culture. Single hybridoma cells are isolated by dilution cloning to generate cell clones that all produce the same antibody; these antibodies are called monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are often purified using Protein A/G or antigen-affinity chromatography.|$|E
5|$|Testing often {{including}} {{observing the}} colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying {{white and red}} blood cells within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and culturing the fluid. The presence of red blood cells and xanthochromia may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage; whereas central nervous system infections such as meningitis, may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels. A CSF culture may yield the microorganism that has caused the infection, or PCR {{may be used to}} identify a viral cause. Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to specific diseases, including multiple sclerosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, systemic lupus erythematosus, neurosarcoidosis, cerebral angiitis; and <b>specific</b> <b>antibodies</b> such as Aquaporin 4 may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions. A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension and normal pressure hydrocephalus.|$|E

40|$|RECENTLY, a complement-dependent, mycoplasmacidal {{reaction}} was described involving T-mycoplasmas and <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> (Lin and Kass, 1970). The concentration of urea {{in the medium}} {{was found to be}} critical for the demonstration of this reaction, presumably because the urease activity of the T-mycoplasmas released enough ammonia to inhibit the ammonia-sensitive components of the complement system.

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue fever may {{be confirmed by}} microbiological laboratory testing. This {{can be done by}} virus isolation in cell cultures, nucleic acid detection by PCR, viral antigen detection (such as for NS1) or <b>specific</b> <b>antibodies</b> (serology). Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost. Detection of NS1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90% sensitive however is only 60–80% in subsequent infections. All tests may be negative {{in the early stages of}} the disease. PCR and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days. In 2012 a PCR test was introduced that can run on equipment used to diagnose influenza; this is likely to improve access to PCR-based diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|The {{activation}} of immune mechanisms was {{evaluated by the}} solid phase enzyme linked immunoassay of immunoglobulin and <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> secreting cells in 27 patients (aged from nine to 69 months), subjected to a diagnostic cow's milk challenge or a rechallenge. A significant rise in {{the total number of}} immunoglobulin secreting cells was associated with clinically positive (n = 17), but not a negative (n = 10) cow's milk challenge in all immunoglobulin isotypes. The number of <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> secreting cells against beta lactoglobulin, mean (95 % confidence interval), increased from 4. 8 (1. 4, 15. 8) to 16. 9 (5. 5, 52. 7) <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> secreting cells/ 10 (6) cells, p = 0. 02, and against casein from 2. 2 (0. 8, 6. 1) to 7. 5 (2. 5, 22. 5) <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> secreting cells/ 10 (6) cells, p = 0. 01, in patients positive to challenge in the IgM class only, indicating defective immune elimination of milk antigens.

These results indicate that cow's milk challenge, in patients who have cow's milk allergy, induces a strong non-antigen specific immune response that includes a response against unrelated antigens concomitantly present in the intestinal lumen. Activation of such immune mechanisms may hence reflect increased antigenic load caused by the immune mediated lesion in the gut mucosa...|$|R

25|$|When {{the immune}} system of a {{vertebrate}} encounters a virus, it may produce <b>specific</b> <b>antibodies</b> which bind to the virus and neutralize its infectivity or mark it for destruction.

40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{into the role}} of antibody and complement in neutrophil phagocytosis and killing of group B streptococci of low and high pathogenicity. Phagocytosis of both types of organism appears to be a nonspecific event requiring only nonspecific antibody or complement. However, neutrophil bactericidal activity is mediated by the pathogenicity of the infecting organism. Neutrophils alone can kill some streptococci of low pathogenicity, but their killing ability is considerably increased in the presence of <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> or complement. An active role for the alternative pathway of complement in the killing process was demonstrated for organisms of low pathogenicity. Neutrophils did not kill the highly pathogenic organisms in the absence of antibody and complement, and required <b>specific</b> <b>antibody,</b> but not complement, to kill these bacteria. The alternative complement pathway is not involved in killing of highly pathogenic organisms. Addition of <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> to neutrophils containing ingested bacteria stimulated the neutrophils to kill the intracellular bacteria, suggesting an alternative role for <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> in the killing process other than as an opsonin.

40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated that exogenous Nef protein induced activation of normal human T cells up-regulating IL- 15 production by monocytes. Since HIV- 1 infection {{results in the}} early impairment of immune functions we decided to evaluate if Nef is able to modulate the induction of a <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> response. Human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} from healthy donors were induced in vitro to mount a <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> response to the Candida albicans antigen. We show that Nef inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the induction of the anti-C. albicans antibody response. The ability of an anti-Nef antibody to prevent such inhibition indicates that the effect was indeed Nef-specific. In the Nef-treated cultures an early increase of IL- 15 production was observed and the addition of anti-IL- 15 antibody abrogated the Nef-induced inhibitory effect. Moreover the addition of IL- 15 to the cultures inhibited, as well as Nef, the induction of the <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> response. Thus, our results suggest that Nef may inhibit the induction of a <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> response by an early up-regulation of IL- 15 production. A better comprehension of this phenomenon may be important for unravelling some aspects of the B cell defects in HIV infection...|$|R

40|$|Legionella pneumophila, the causative {{agent of}} Legionnaires' disease, is a facultative {{intracellular}} pathogen of alveolar macrophages. Although {{previous studies have}} demonstrated that <b>specific</b> <b>antibody</b> facilitates uptake of L. pneumophila by phagocytic cells, the role of complement has been unclear. Thus, we have examined the relative contributions of Fc gamma- and complement receptor-mediated adherence to guinea pig peritoneal macrophages, U 937 human monocytic cells, and J 774 mouse macrophage cells. Opsonization of L. pneumophila (Philadelphia 2) with polyclonal immunoglobulin G promoted maximum adherence to guinea pig macrophages. In contrast, incubation in the presence of 20 % fresh nonimmune human serum from a single donor did not promote adherence. The results obtained with U 937 and J 774 cells paralleled those obtained with guinea pig macrophages.
