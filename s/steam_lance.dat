50|$|In Germany too, {{locomotive}} sheds {{often had}} tube cleaning equipment (Rohrblasgerüst) {{which was used}} to blow through the boiler tubes. This tube cleaning, carried out by a <b>steam</b> <b>lance,</b> {{had to be done}} once a week. Residue left in the fire and smoke tubes not only reduced the transfer of heat from the hot smoke gases to the water in the boiler, but also accelerated corrosion of the tubes.|$|E
40|$|Philaenus spumarius Linnaeus, 1758, (Hemiptera Aphrophoridae) AKA the Meadow Spittlebug {{belongs to}} a Taxon whose {{juvenile}} live protected into a foamy mass they inflate starting from external glandular secretions and anal excretions. Several species share the behaviour and the common name and are capable of infesting uncultured fields building up an exceedingly high population {{that are difficult to}} manage also due to their protected lifestyle. P. spumarius control was almost out of the question until the demonstration of its ability to transmit the Xylella fastidiosa pauca strain responsible for the Apulian Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS) epidemics. Moreover, being the percentage of Ps over the total spittlebug number almost unpredictable and existing any selective control means, we are somehow forced to control the entire population either as juveniles or adults. Over and above that, control of juveniles is strongly preferable because they have a negligible ability to transmit Xf. Physical (mechanical) vector control has already been suggested targeting nymph 4 & 5 and it revealed to be feasible and effective but elicited the concern of organic management stakeholder because of the possible disturbance to soil integrity. Given the premise, we consider here a combination of physical action (hot 60 - 90 °CT steam) and a biocontrol insecticide (ABP- 617, tradename Flipper by AlphaBio Control Ltd.) of vegetal origin based on carboxylic acids (C 14 – C 20) potassium salts. Steam originated from an MM STEAM 100 - 12 V weed control machine equipped with a hand shielded <b>steam</b> <b>lance</b> and the insecticide was poured into the water tank at 0. 1 % v/v (498 mg of a. s. /l of water). Trials were conducted on May 8 th, 2017 near Somaglia (LO) in uncultivated area and we used a randomised block scheme with a 0. 25 -m 2 -wide test and three replicates, each 0. 25 -m 2 -wide. To avoid bias effects from adjacent untreated areas we treated not only the plots but a 50 -cm large frame around each block of four 0. 25 m 2 replicates, a total surface of 4 m 2 for each treatment, block + frame. During the action, the lance distributed steam plus insecticide over the block + frame for 4 ’ 43 ” consuming 4 - 5 liters of water from the tank, about 1 lt/m 2, that corresponds to an insecticide rate of 10 l/ha. After the action, we waited 5 minutes and registered T°C data by a Flir thermographic camera before collecting, separately all the plants of each repetition of 0. 25 m 2. Infestation on the test was 20 - 28 spittles per square meter, but we found neither spittle nor nymphs in treated repetitions. Moreover, steam desiccated herbs after 3 days from the action. Finally, we discuss pros & cons of the proposed integrated control action by efficacy, impact and possible interaction with other IPM vector components...|$|E
5000|$|Tube {{cleaning}} is {{the process}} whereby the boiler tubes of steam locomotives are cleaned out, removing soot and ash {{in order to ensure}} the effective generation of the draught for the fire. This was often done with <b>steam</b> <b>lances</b> or compressed air and accompanied by brushing as required.|$|R
40|$|Acousticlean Sonic Sootblowers, or 'horns' are low frequency, {{high energy}} {{acoustical}} devices which offer a low-cost approach to cleaning {{many areas of}} the boiler and its associated equipment. The horns are presently in use and/or are being evaluated at more than 50 sites in the U. S., and at many more in Europe, where the technology originated. This paper describes five industrial applications of the horns to solve operating problems in varied industries. The applications discussed include utilization in pulp mill hog fuel boilers to substantially reduce <b>steam</b> <b>lancing</b> requirements; use in recovery boiler precipitators to reduce salt cake buildups; maintenance of clean economizer sections in oil field steam generators; waste fuel boilers; and precipitator dust minimization in smelting operations. A comparison of acoustical energy versus steam sootblowing costs is also included...|$|R
40|$|Removal plants (BNR) {{activated}} sludge plants in Southern Africa, routinely treating 120 - 150 Ml/day. The plant is operated by Johannesburg Water and discharges to the sensitive Vaal Barrage catchment. The plant {{has a large}} anaerobic digestion facility, originally equipped with steam heating and gas mixing facilities. The Anaerobic Digesters at Goudkoppies Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) were operating without adequate mixing and heating {{for a period of}} time. Without proper mixing, digester heating via <b>steam</b> <b>lances</b> could not be carried out as direct steam injection would kill the anaerobic bacteria. Without mixing and heating, the Digesters were unable to perform as originally designed, as current operating conditions do not meet the required retention time for ambient temperature digestion. The digester complex consists of six digesters, eight compressors for gas mixing, five steam boilers for heating, gas holder with waste gas flare, gas/steam piping and associated safety equipment. A digester refurbishment project was implemented with the following components: a) Installation of eight (8) liquid ring compressors, including gas/liquid separators an...|$|R
