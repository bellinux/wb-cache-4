5|$|After the shipwreck, Grill {{remained}} in Canton as resident <b>supercargo</b> for seven years. As such {{he was the}} company's representative in Canton, contacting Chinese merchants as well as buying goods and cargo for the ships. He was <b>supercargo</b> {{for the arrival of}} three more ships of the SIOC: the Stockholms Slott (outward journey) in 1762, the Stockholms Slott (resident <b>supercargo</b> in Canton) in 1765 and the Cron Prins Gustaf (journey home) 1768. One of his tasks in Canton was {{to make sure that the}} Swedish factory at the Thirteen Factories was in good order and maintained. The Swedes rented factories or houses from the mandarins at other locations as well, but the one on 13:e Faktorigatan (the 13th Factory street) operated as their main building. Grills records of the Swedish factory are detailed and provide good insight into life in Canton at that time.|$|E
5|$|Jean Abraham Grill (21July 173612March 1792), {{sometimes}} called Johan Abraham Grill, was a Swedish merchant, <b>supercargo,</b> {{director of the}} Swedish East India Company (SOIC) and ironmaster at Godegård with several factories.|$|E
5|$|The {{resident}} <b>supercargo</b> {{was responsible}} for buying goods such as tea, porcelain, silk, arrack, sago and miscellaneous for the next ship arriving from Sweden. The SOIC traded mainly with the Chinese merchant Puankhequa, who had his factory next to the Swedish, and judging from their letters, Puankhequa and Grill became friends. Grill was entrusted with funds from the SOIC for buying tea and other goods during off-season when the price was at its lowest. He bought most of the tea from Puankhequa, and several contracts are preserved. However, he did not buy the tea from the Chinese merchant on the SOIC's behalf but instead bought it through his own company and sold {{it on to the}} SOIC at a slightly higher price. After some time the SOIC became suspicious and director David Sandberg was sent to Canton to investigate the matter in 1766. Grill and his companions, Grubb and Hahr, had to sign an agreement not to misuse their position within the SOIC. In 1768, Grill was ordered to return home as <b>supercargo</b> on the ship Cron Prins Gustaf. Even so, Hahr stayed behind in Canton, continued their business and was able to transfer Grill's share of the profit through international bank notes.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the captains}} and <b>supercargos</b> of trading ships {{could expect to}} sell such {{novelties}} at a great profit, Tembinok' controlled access to his islands and would refuse {{to deal with those}} whom he considered to take advantage of him. Stevenson describes Tembinok' as classing captains and <b>supercargoes</b> in three categories: [...] "He cheat a little"—"He cheat plenty"—and [...] "I think he cheat too much”.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's well known," [...] was the <b>supercargo's</b> reply. He {{turned to}} the steersman: [...] "Tai-Hotauri, what about old Parlay's pearls?" ...|$|R
25|$|Although Imperial Eagle was British-owned and operated, {{the ship}} masqueraded as a vessel of the fictitious Austrian East India Company, and sailed under {{the flag of}} Austria. In fact the ship was owned by various British <b>supercargoes,</b> {{including}} some in China and several East India Company directors in England. They called their partnership the Austrian East India Company. John Reid and Daniel Beale {{were two of the}} <b>supercargoes.</b> Beale, operating out of Canton, acted as the Prussian agent in that port.|$|R
5|$|On , the ship's <b>supercargo</b> ordered some assegais, or African spears, {{and some}} swords, {{to be brought}} on deck for the Malagasy to clean. When the weapons were clean and the Malagasy were ordered to return them, they {{attacked}} the ship's crew, and {{took control of the}} ship. A truce ensued, the terms of which were that if the Malagasy would spare the lives of the remaining crew the ship would be sailed back to Madagascar, but taking advantage of the Malagasy's lack of navigational skills, the crew instead set sail for the coast of southern Africa.|$|E
25|$|Roberts {{entered the}} New England {{triangular}} trade as shipowner {{and his own}} <b>supercargo,</b> but never as a captain.|$|E
25|$|Joel Root as <b>supercargo</b> sailed out of New Haven harbor in 1802 on the brig Huron {{to begin}} his journey {{around the world on}} a sealing expedition.|$|E
5000|$|In 1686, Westerners {{were allowed}} to rent {{accommodations}} in the factory quarter to avoid the necessity of shuttling back to Pazhou each night. For the most part, the <b>supercargos,</b> their assistants, and the bookkeepers stayed at the factories, the crew—except for a few guards or those on shore leave—stayed with the ships, and the captains continued to ferry between the two. A Chinese comprador hired each factory's staff of Chinese servants and bought its provisions from local vendors; senior <b>supercargos</b> sometimes brought their own staff or slaves as well. Another comprador dealt with the ship's provisions at Pazhou, where sampan ladies crowded around the ships to do laundry and odd jobs for the sailors. A few weeks before departure, the crew came to the factories in shifts of a few days each for shore leave, chaperoned {{by some of the}} ship's officers. Hog Lane was lined with open-fronted booths and shops catering to them, selling food, drink, clothing, and [...] "chowchows" [...] (novelties), and was policed by Chinese guards stationed {{at both ends of the}} alley. At first the <b>supercargos</b> came and left with the ships, but over the course of the 18th century companies began to rent their factory spaces year-round to avoid being displaced on their return. The <b>supercargos</b> were then permitted to outstay their company's ships a few weeks to conduct business for the next season; after that, they were obliged to remove themselves to Macao through the spring and summer until the appearance of the next ship. By the 1760s, every East India company had permanent <b>supercargos</b> and rooms were being rented in Macao year-round as well.|$|R
60|$|As {{they left}} the compound, Peter Gee nudged Grief to look where Tui Tulifau {{reclined}} on the mats. The <b>supercargo's</b> shirt, stretched and bulged, already encased the royal fat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Work! I was a {{surprise}} to myself. It is an amazement, the amount of time a man finds on his hands after he's given up carousing, and gambling, and all the time-eating diversions of the beach. And I didn't waste a second of all my new-found time. Instead I worked it overtime. I did the work of half a dozen men. I became a driver. My captains made faster runs than ever and earned bigger bonuses, as did my <b>supercargoes,</b> who saw to it that my schooners did not loaf and dawdle along the way. And I saw to it that my <b>supercargoes</b> did see to it.|$|R
25|$|On 22 May 1889 whilst the Colonist {{was lying}} at anchor in Havannah Harbour in the New Hebrides Group the {{shipmaster}} William Greenless {{was shot and killed}} by the <b>supercargo</b> of the vessel Henry Ernest Weaver.|$|E
25|$|Condy Raguet {{was born}} on January 28, 1784 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Of French descent, Raguet was educated at the University of Pennsylvania and for {{eighteen}} months after graduating he studied law. He {{had to give up}} his studies {{after the death of his}} father and became a merchant for a counting house. In 1804 he was sent to Santo Domingo as <b>supercargo</b> for a ship. He spent four months there and on his return he wrote and published A Short Account of the Present State of Affairs in St. Domingo. Raguet returned for eight months in 1805 and again published a book about events on the island. On December 23, 1807, Raguet was married to Catherine S. Simmons.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} 1890s and into {{first decade of}} the 20th century, {{structural}} changes occurred in the operation of the Pacific trading companies; they moved from a practice of having traders resident on each island to instead becoming a business operation where the <b>supercargo</b> (the cargo manager of a trading ship) would deal directly with the islanders when a ship visited an island. From 1900 the numbers of palagi traders in Tuvalu declined and the last of the palagi traders were Fred Whibley on Niutao, Alfred Restieaux on Nukufetau, and Martin Kleis on Nui. By 1909 there were no more resident palagi traders representing the trading companies, although both Whibley and Restieaux remained in the islands until their deaths.|$|E
5000|$|The foreign {{agents were}} {{known at the}} time as [...] "supercargos" [...] in English and as daban (...) in Chinese. This term's Cantonese pronunciation, tai-pan, only came into common English use after the rise of private trading from 1834 on. A private captain might be his own supercargo; a large East Indiamen might have five or more, which were ranked [...] "chief supercargo", [...] "2nd supercargo", and so on. A team of <b>supercargos</b> divided their work, some {{overseeing}} sales, others tea purchases, silk purchases, and so forth. Permanent <b>supercargos</b> might divide their work by the order ships arrived. The bookkeepers who attended them were called [...] "writers"; those serving with the ship, who also checked these accounts, [...] "pursers".|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} a stormy meeting {{was being held}} in the <b>supercargo's</b> office. At first Van Blott flatly refused to allow Phil {{to look at his}} books, but at last brought forth several, which the shipowner's son knew were of little importance.|$|R
50|$|The ship's captain John Green (1736-1796) was {{a former}} U.S. naval officer, its two {{business}} agents (<b>supercargos),</b> Samuel Shaw (1754-1794) and Thomas Randall (1723-1797), were former officers in the U.S. Continental Army, and its syndicate of owners, including Robert Morris (1734-1806) {{were some of the}} richest men in the new nation.|$|R
25|$|Slave voyage #4: Kitty's Amelia {{underwent}} coppering {{and repairs}} in 1807. Then on July 1807 Thomas Forrest {{received a letter}} of marque for Kitty's Amelia. The Act for {{the abolition of the}} slave trade had passed Parliament in 1806 and took effect on 1 May 1807. However, Kitty's Amelia had received clearance to sail 27 April, before the deadline. Thus, when she sailed on 27 July, she did so legally. This was the last legal slave voyage for an English vessel. On her voyage she carried a <b>supercargo,</b> Captain Hugh Crow (or Crowe), who was a renowned and successful slave trader. On the way to Bonny, Forrest died and Crow took command.|$|E
25|$|Henry Ernest Weaver (captain / <b>supercargo),</b> {{had been}} married in London in 1873 and then {{made his way to}} Brisbane. In March 1875 the master (Goodall) of the Queen May, a regular blackbirding vessel, died whist {{unloading}} supplies at Rockhampton. The mate then took over command but was then caught by floods in Rockhampton. So Henry Weaver was appointed as captain but after about {{a day and a half}} at sea the crew reported Weaver as insane and had fears for his safety. Alexander Goodall, aged 18, and a son of the just deceased Captain Goodall, was chosen by the crew as master and he proceeded back to Gladstone and handed Weaver over to the authorities.|$|E
25|$|The Old China Trade left a {{significant}} mark in two historic districts, Chestnut Street District, {{part of the}} Samuel McIntire Historic District containing 407 buildings, and the Salem Maritime National Historic Site, consisting of 12 historic structures and about 9 acres (36,000 m²) of land along the waterfront in Salem. Elias Hasket Derby was among the wealthiest and most celebrated of post-Revolutionary merchants in Salem. Derby was also {{the owner of the}} Grand Turk, the first New England vessel to trade directly with China and second to sail from the United States after the Empress of China. Thomas H. Perkins was his <b>supercargo</b> and established strong ties with the Chinese and garnered the Forbes fortune through his illegal opium sales.|$|E
6000|$|At this {{a slight}} frown crossed the <b>supercargo's</b> face, {{but he quickly}} smiled it off. [...] "As you please," [...] he said. [...] "But excuse me now, I'm very busy. We {{are trying to get}} ready to sail to-morrow by noon, and there is still a great deal to do." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first mate}} hesitated, and an {{argument}} lasting {{a full hour}} ensued, during which the former <b>supercargo's</b> plot was discussed from every possible point of view. At last the first mate agreed to do as Jasper Van Blott wanted, and then the two separated, to await the time for making their first move.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{discovered}} that, rather than {{depending on the}} monsoon winds, ships could arrive or depart {{at any time of}} year by rounding the Philippines. This opened the trade for smaller craft who might only need a few weeks to complete a visit, where the large company vessels still needed 4 to 5 months at minimum. Subsequently, the British and Americans typically always had ships anchored off Pazhou, allowing them to keep their <b>supercargos</b> and staff in the Guangzhou factories all year. During the 1780s, the Spanish also began to send several ships from Manila each year rather than the single vessel they had previously used; they began renting a permanent factory in 1788. (In practice, senior <b>supercargos</b> tended to prefer Macao during the summer regardless and to send their junior officers to deal with off-season trade.) ...|$|R
25|$|The Hersilia {{departed}} from Stonington, Connecticut for the Antarctic Ocean in July 1819. Over {{a decade later}} Edmund Fanning claimed that it was sent to go exploring the southern Pacific Ocean. However this has been challenged by later historians, who question Fanning's assertion. Sheffield served as its captain, W. Fanning as <b>supercargo</b> and Nathaniel Palmer as second mate. The Hersilia stopped in the Falkland Islands to procure much needed water and food supplies. It is uncertain the precise date the Hersilia reached the South Shetland Islands, but it was primarily stationed at Hersilia Cove on Rugged Island. An estimated 9,000 Antarctic fur seal {{were killed by the}} crew for their valuable pelts over the span of two weeks. Afterwards, the Hersilia returned to Stonington in early 1820.|$|E
25|$|Condy Raguet (January 28, 1784 – March 22, 1842) was {{the first}} chargé d'affaires from the United States to Brazil and a noted {{politician}} and free trade advocate from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Of French descent, Raguet was educated at the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating he began studying law but {{had to give up}} his studies {{after the death of his}} father. He briefly worked as <b>supercargo</b> for a counting house, before going into business for himself. He later worked as manager or president for several companies, the most notable being the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society. In 1816 Raguet read about the growth of savings banks in Great Britain and liked the idea; he approached other Philadelphia business associates and together they created the Society, the first savings bank in the United States.|$|E
25|$|From around 1900 Henderson and Macfarlane {{dominated}} the copra trade, operating their vessel SS Archer in the South Pacific with a trading route to Fiji and the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. New competition came from Burns Philp, operating {{from what is}} now Kiribati, with competition from Levers Pacific Plantations from 1903 and from Captain E. F. H. Allen of the Samoa Shipping and Trading Company from 1911. Structural changes also occurred {{in the operation of}} the trading companies, which moved from a practice of having traders resident on each island to trade with the islanders to a business operation where the <b>supercargo</b> (the cargo manager of a trading ship) would deal directly with the islanders when a ship would visit an island; by 1909 there were no resident palagi traders representing the trading firms. Tuvaluans became responsible for operating trading stores on each island.|$|E
60|$|In {{this mean}} figure the sloop returned; {{she had a}} new man put into her for captain, one we knew how to trust; and the old pilot {{appearing}} only as a passenger, the doctor and William acting as the <b>supercargoes,</b> by a formal procuration from one Captain Singleton, and all things ordered in form.|$|R
60|$|We {{were now}} {{bound to the}} Gulf of Persia, and from thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to touch at Surat; but {{the chief of the}} <b>supercargo's</b> design lay at the Bay of Bengal, where if he missed of the {{business}} outward-bound he was to go up to China, and return to the coast as he came home.|$|R
5000|$|On 15 February 1786, a Prussian ship {{arrived at}} Whampoa whereupon the East India Company’s agent at Canton {{informed}} the Committee of <b>Supercargoes</b> that Beale {{had shown him}} a letter signed by [...] "Count Lusi, Envoy Extraordinaire to his Majesty the King of Prussia with the King of Great Britain and his Colonel of Infantry", announcing his appointment as his Prussian Majesty’s Consul in China.|$|R
25|$|The son of planter Capt. Joseph Martin Sr. and {{his wife}} Susannah Chiles, {{great-granddaughter}} of Colonel John Page, Joseph Martin Jr. {{was raised in a}} Virginia gentry family in Caroline and Albemarle Counties. His father, Joseph Martin Sr., was the son of wealthy British merchant William Martin in Bristol, England, who sent his son to Virginia as <b>supercargo</b> aboard his ship the Brice. Martin Sr. wrote to his English father that he planned to marry the daughter of a common Virginia colonist. Even though she was from the Chiles family and was a descendant of Virginia's Col. John Page, to Martin's wealthy father back in England all American colonists were inferior to the English. William Martin of Bristol was himself Lord Mayor of Bristol and owner of a ship building company, a glass manufacturing plant, importer and exporter with the new world; including tobacco. The father wrote back disinheriting young Joseph Martin Sr., who never returned to England.|$|E
25|$|Dumaresque and Paz also {{captured}} Montesquieu, {{which occurred}} on 27 March 1813. She {{belonged to the}} Philadelphia banker Stephen Girard and was bringing a valuable cargo of tea, nankeen, silk, copper, and cassia (Chinese cinnamon - Cinnamomum cassia), from Canton. Dumaresque put the entire crew of Montesquiue and their baggage into the ship's pinnace, except for the ship's <b>supercargo,</b> Arthur Grelaud, and the ship's steward. The captain and crew arrived safely in Lewis Town that same day and the captain immediately {{sent a letter to}} Girard. Beresford arrived on the scene in Poictiers. Beresford took Montesqieu into the Delaware River and immediately entered into negotiations with Girard's agents instead of sending the vessel to be condemned at the Vice admiralty court in Halifax. Girard, with the authorization of the American authorities, paid 180,000 Spanish milled dollars ransom for his vessel, an amount that Grelaud had negotiated. Girard applied to the US authorities for permission to pay the ransom, which he received. (Girard's Bank was a principal source of government credit during the War of 1812.) Dumaresque, and his descendents, blamed Beresford for having deprived them of the prize. Paz shared the ransom with Belvidera and Poictiers.|$|E
500|$|Also, {{a number}} of <b>supercargo</b> {{personnel}} joined Triton for her shakedown cruise, with none aware of the top-secret nature of Operation Sandblast. [...] Joseph Baynor Roberts was a well-known photographer from the National Geographic Magazine, and as a Commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve, he was recalled to active duty {{to serve as the}} press pool for the voyage with the U.S. Navy Office of Information. [...] Additionally, Roberts and First Class Photographer's Mate (PH1) William R. Hadley, USN, detached from Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet, coordinated the photo-reconnaissance aspects of Operation Sandblast.|$|E
5000|$|The {{goods that}} were {{exported}} from Sweden also changed during that period. The former main {{products such as}} iron, wood and tar are missing from the freight lists. Instead the biggest item was silver, followed by English lead and Swedish woollen cloth or broadcloth. During the later part of the third charter, it became common practice {{for one of the}} <b>supercargoes</b> to stay on permanently in Canton for years. One of those was Jean Abraham Grill, who made ample use of his time there for his own private affairs, a practice that was continued by other resident <b>supercargoes.</b> Carl Linnaeus and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences also made use of the company's ships. They sent out scientists and researchers to gather information about animals and plants from all the places that the ships visited and to keep detailed journals. The company would not allow idle passengers on board, so most of the scientists were given [...] "crash courses" [...] in theology and were hastily ordained to serve as ship's chaplains. These arrangements started during the second charter and peaked during the third.|$|R
5000|$|The East India Marine Society (est. 1799) of Salem, Massachusetts, United States, was [...] "composed {{of persons}} who have {{actually}} navigated the seas beyond the Cape of Good Hope or Cape Horn, as masters or <b>supercargoes</b> of vessels belonging to Salem." [...] It functioned as a charitable and educational organization, and maintained a library and museum. It flourished especially in the 1800s-1830s, a heyday of foreign trade. In 1910 the society reincorporated as [...] "Trustees of the Salem East India Marine Society." ...|$|R
