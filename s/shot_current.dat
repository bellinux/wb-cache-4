Sampled signals are sensed by a virtual‐ground, floating‐gate amplifier without draining charge from the device under test or the photoconductive switch. The minimum detectable signal is 2. 5 μV/Hz 1 / 2 with a spatial resolution of 7 μm, while the sampling bandwidth is essentially that observed using photoconductive sampling with a conductive contact to the device under test.

40|$|We are {{presently}} adding {{the capability to}} irradiate indirectly-driven Nova targets with two rings of illumination inside {{each end of the}} hohlraum for studies of time-dependent second Legendre (P 2) and time- integrated fourth Legendre (P 4) flux asymmetry control. The rings will be formed with specially designed kinoform phase plates (KPPs), which will direct each half of each beam into two separate rings that are nearly uniform azimuthally. The timing and temporal pulse shape of the outer rings will be controlled independently from those of the inner rings, allowing for phasing of the pulse shapes to control time dependent asymmetry. Modifications to the incident beam diagnostics (IBDS) will enable us to verify that acceptable levels of power balance among the contributing segments of each ring have been achieved on each <b>shot.</b> <b>Current</b> techniques for precision beam pointing and timing are expected to be sufficiently accurate for these experiments.

40|$|We {{examine the}} spin current and the {{associated}} shot noise generated in a quantum dot connected to normal leads with zero bias voltage across the dot. The spin current is generated by spin flip transitions induced by a quantized electromagnetic field inside a cavity {{with one of the}} Zeeman states lying below the Fermi level of the leads and the other above. In the limit of strong Coulomb blockade, this model is analogous to the Jaynes-Cummings model in quantum optics. We also calculate the photon current and photon <b>current</b> <b>shot</b> noise resulting from photons leaking out of the cavity. We show that the photon current is equal to the spin current and that the spin current can be significantly larger than for the case of a classical driving field as a result of cavity losses. In addition to this, the frequency dependent spin (photon) <b>current</b> <b>shot</b> noise show dips (peaks) that are a result of the discrete nature of photons...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine origins of {{electronic}} noise in a 127 -micron pixel {{thin film transistor}} (TFT) /photodiode image sensor array. The imaging array is a 1536 data line by 1920 gate line amorphous Silicon (a-Si) sensor array connected to low noise charge amplifiers and 14 -bit electronics. We measure the contributions of A/D converters, charge amplifiers, data-line resistance and capacitance, and pixel switching to the overall electronic noise of 1040 e- per pixel. Noise power spectra are evaluated for each dark offset image. When suitably filtered linear power supplies are used for supplying gate and bias voltages to the array, the noise power spectra are identical in the x and y directions, i. e., row correlated noise is negligible. Noise measurements taken under different band-pass conditions correlate well with data-line resistance generated Johnson noise. No variations in noise along the data lines and a slight reduction in noise along the gate lines suggest only small transmission line effects. Pixel noise was measured {{as a function of}} frame time, yielding a component of noise due to TFT switching and a frame time dependent component modeled as pixel leakage <b>current</b> <b>shot</b> noise. It was found that this <b>shot</b> noise <b>current</b> was three times higher than leakage currents derived from dark offset difference images...|$|R
