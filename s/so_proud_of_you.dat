2500|$|Nick Bond of News.com.au {{described}} Dicko's {{criticism of}} Paulini's gold dress as [...] "one {{of the most}} controversial moments in Australian Idol history," [...] while Andrew Bucklow from the same publication labelled it one of the show's [...] "most infamous moments" [...] ever. During Dicko's appearance on The Celebrity Apprentice Australia in 2012, he revealed that [...] "people were virtually spitting on me" [...] after that Australian Idol episode had aired, calling it a defining moment for him because he [...] "became a national pariah" [...] overnight. In an episode of The Celebrity Apprentice and in reference to the gold dress controversy, Dicko made a statue of someone wearing a gold dress with the word [...] "sorry" [...] printed on it. Paulini appeared in the episode to see what Dicko had made and she accepted his apology. In 2014, Dicko told Woman's Day that he does not regret what he said to Paulini, saying [...] "It’s part of who I am and who Paulini is and it binds us together." [...] In July 2017, Dicko apologised again in a pre-recorded message he left for Paulini during her radio interview on Hot 91.1 FM's breakfast show, Dave, Sam & Ash. In the message, Dicko said [...] "I was trying to be nice at the time, can you believe, but I'm glad that you've gone on to do such great things." [...] After joking that his [...] "cruel little words" [...] turned them [...] "into Australian reality TV's power couple", he ended his message by telling Paulini, [...] "what I want to say is, I'm <b>so</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> girl, you go get'em." ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} eighth grade predictor variables for predictive power in identifying students at-risk for {{dropping out of}} high school in a northwest Georgia school district. This study involved 340 participants from the 2005 / 2006 ninth grade class in the selected school district. This quantitative study employed correlation analyses to determine the linear relationship between dropping {{out of high school}} and the predictor variables. Logistic regression analysis determined which set of predictor variables best predicted the student outcome. The analysis indicated that years retained, discipline referrals, socioeconomic status, final math grade, CRCT math score, and absences were the most significant predictors of high school end status (dropout or graduate). A regression model using the six variables was able to correctly classify 91. 5 % of the cases. ii DEDICATION This dissertation is dedicated to my two precious daughters, Sydney and Allie.
