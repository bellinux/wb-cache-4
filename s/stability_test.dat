The Safety Investigation Report made by the Korea Maritime Safety Tribunal noted that Sewol at the time of departure was carrying 2,142.7 tons of cargo when its maximum allowance was 987 tons. TIME magazine further noted that the cargo had been improperly secured. The Report also noted that only 761.2 tons of ballast were taken on board, that some ballast tanks had not been properly maintained, and that the last voyage was made without making further adjustments to the ballast during the journey. Kukmin Ilbo reported that Captain Shin, the regular captain of Sewol, had warned the company about the decrease in stability and passenger satisfaction and attributed it to the removal of the side ramp. However, Captain Shin claimed that the company responded with threats to fire him if he continued his objections. Captain Shin's warnings were also relayed through an official working for the Incheon Port Authority on 9 April 2014, which an official from the company responded to by stating that he would deal with anyone making the claims. The Korea Herald also reported that the captain had requested a repair for the malfunctioning steering gear on 1 April 2014, which was not done. The Daily Telegraph reported that the Korean Register of Shipping had noted in a <b>stability</b> <b>test</b> report dated 24 January 2014 that Sewol had become 'top heavy and less stable after modifications were made.' The New York Times reported that the company budget for the safety training of the crew was $2 USD, which was used to buy a paper certificate.|$|E

30|$|Some {{studies showed}} a {{positive}} correlation between bulk foam <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> and coreflood <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> under oil-free conditions. Vikingstad and Aarra (2009) used a blender to disperse air for generating foam at a somewhat higher temperature (50  °C). They noted the decrease in foam height with time and compared results with coreflood <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> in which N 2 and surfactant solution were simultaneously injected at a moderate rate and pressure to yield a transitional foam quality (qT = 40  ml/h, Pinj = 120  bar/ 1764 psig, and Fg = 80 %). They observed that the foam stability and strength were similar in both bulk foam <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> and coreflood <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> in oil-free conditions. Also, Jones et al. (2015) suggested using bulk foam <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> as a proxy to coreflood <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> for screening foaming surfactants.|$|R

40|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} all {{injuries}} of the upper limb and 7 % of all injuries in skiing affect the ulnar collateral ligaments of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint (skier's thumb). In some patients the collateral ligaments are displaced proximally over the adductor aponeurosis, resulting in a so-called Stener lesion. In these cases surgical treatment is indicated. We hypothesized that a Stener lesion could be provoked by clinical <b>stability</b> <b>testing</b> in patients with a skiers thumb and performed a cadaveric study on 10 Thiel fixated cadaver hands. For clinical <b>stability</b> <b>testing,</b> the thumb was manually deviated in radial direction in both 30 degrees flexion and extension of the MP-joint. It was performed with maximum strength by two hand surgeons after sequential detachment of the ulnar collateral ligaments. After every sequence, it was assessed if the clinical <b>stability</b> <b>testing</b> had caused a Stener lesion. All of the 10 cadavers showed identical results while <b>testing</b> the clinical <b>stability.</b> A decreased stability was only found after cutting both parts of the ulnar collateral ligaments. A Stener lesion could not be provoked {{in any of the}} cadavers at any time by clinical <b>stability</b> <b>testing.</b> Summarizing our findings we conclude that a proper performed clinical <b>stability</b> <b>testing</b> of the thumb MP joint is a safe maneuver, which does not lead to a Stener lesion in patients with skier's thumb...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{summarise}} and critically review the existing published literature {{with regard to}} clinical considerations as well as <b>stability</b> <b>testing</b> studies of Ifosfamide and Mesna.

Summary: Ifosfamide and Mesna are currently given to patients for 14 days continuous home-based infusion for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. No previous work has evaluated their stability for more than 7 days under real-life conditions so the current regimen involves patients visiting hospital twice during the 14 -day treatment. This may create extra disruption to patients’ life style as well as increasing the workload for cancer services. Conclusion: There is a need to conduct <b>stability</b> <b>testing</b> experiments for Ifosfamide and Mesna taking into consideration all of the highlighted factors to mimic standard clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} linear matrix inequality (LMI) {{conditions to}} test whether an uncertain linear system is exponentially stable with a given decay rate α. These new α-exponential <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> are derived for an uncertain system described by an interconnection of a nominal linear time-invariant system and a “troublesome ” perturbation. The perturbation can contain uncertain parameters, time delays, or nonlinearities. This paper presents two key contributions. First, α-exponential stability of the uncertain LTI system is shown to be equivalent to (internal) linear stability of a related scaled system. This enables derivation of α-exponential <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> from traditional robust <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> using integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). This connection requires IQCs to be constructed for a scaled perturbation operator. The second contribution {{is a list of}} IQCs derived for the scaled perturbation using the detailed structure of the original perturbation. Finally, connections between the proposed approach and related work are discussed. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to examine and to quantify the stability of mixed grain sediment beds previously exposed to different time length of uniform antecedent flow hydrograph. The assessment of bed stability was carried out based on the observation of temporal pattern of eroded sediment during two identical <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> with time varying flow and higher peak discharge. This was linked to the movement of individual sediment fractions to obtain fractional critical shear stress in a bimodal sediment mixture. The <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> suggest a considerable increased in the stability of individual grain. Longer exposure time by antecedent flow clearly had an influence in the increasing stability of the bed. The increased rate of fractional critical shear stress during <b>stability</b> <b>tests</b> varied between 16 % and 35 % in the coarse mode whilst in the fine mode the rate of increase varied between 27 % and 39 %...|$|R

50|$|The {{importance}} of the criterion is that the roots p of the characteristic equation of a linear system with negative real parts represent solutions ept {{of the system that}} are stable (bounded). Thus the criterion provides a way to determine if the equations of motion of a linear system have only stable solutions, without solving the system directly. For discrete systems, the corresponding <b>stability</b> <b>test</b> can be handled by the Schur-Cohn criterion, the Jury test and the Bistritz test.
