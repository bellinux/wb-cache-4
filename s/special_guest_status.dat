50|$|<b>Special</b> <b>Guest</b> <b>status</b> {{with the}} Parliamentary Assembly was {{established}} in 1989, as a provisional status in the accession process for parliaments of European non-member states, which applied {{for membership in the}} Council of Europe. The aim of the <b>special</b> <b>guest</b> <b>status</b> is to foster closer relations with the national parliaments of the European non-member states, by enabling the parliament concerned to be represented in, and work with, the Assembly, especially in determining the accession conditions.|$|E

The <b>special</b> <b>guest</b> <b>status</b> was however suspended {{as a consequence}} of the November 1996 constitutional referendum introducing death penalty, and parliament by-elections which the CoE found to be undemocratic, as well as enforced limits on democratic freedoms such as freedom of expression (cf. Belarusian media) under the administration of President Alexander Lukashenko. A second change of the Belarus constitution in October 2004, moreover [...] "does not respect minimum democratic standards and violates the principles of separation of powers and the rule of law". In June 2009, PACE decided that the suspension of the Belarusian parliament’s <b>special</b> <b>guest</b> <b>status</b> in the Assembly would only be lifted conditional of the government imposing a moratorium on the death penalty. As of May 2013, this condition had not been met.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} concerning the observer status of Japan and the United States because both countries apply the death penalty. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has been lobbying for the United States and Japan {{to abolish the}} death penalty or lose their observer status. The Council also voted to restore <b>Special</b> <b>Guest</b> <b>status</b> to Belarus, on condition that Belarus declares a moratorium on the death penalty.|$|E
5000|$|Kazakhstan {{applied for}} the <b>Special</b> <b>Guest</b> <b>status</b> with the Parliamentary Assembly in 1999. The Assembly found that Kazakhstan could apply for full membership, because 4% of its territory, west of the Ural river, is located in Europe, but {{granting}} <b>Special</b> <b>Guest</b> <b>status</b> would require improvements {{in the fields of}} democracy and human rights. Kazakhstan signed a co-operation agreement with the Assembly in April 2004. In November 2006, the Kazakhstan Parliament officially asked to be granted observer status with the Assembly, which however never was granted due to requiring a pre compliance with all CoE core values and principles. The country acceded to the Council of Europe European Cultural Convention on 24 February 2010. On 15 to 16 March 2010, the President of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) made an official visit to Kazakhstan, resulting in the conclusion that the Council of Europe and Kazakhstan strengthen their relations. This milestone emboldens Kazakhstan's [...] "Path to Europe" [...] programme, as outlined by Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev in Astana in 2008. In December 2013, a Joint Declaration on enhancing cooperation between Kazakhstan and the Council of Europe in 2014-15, was signed with the purpose of paving the way for Kazakhstan's accession to the Council of Europe's multiple conventions in the field of criminal justice.|$|E
40|$|The Council of Europe is a European {{international}} organisation {{with the aim}} to promote the cooperation of its member states {{on the basis of}} democracy, respect for human rights and the state of law. Until 1989 its membership was confined to the Western European states. Soon {{after the collapse of the}} Warsaw Pact in 1989, the first Eastern European states applied for membership. Since 1989, the membership of the Council of Europe has enlarged from 23 to now 44 states. The application for membership of the Eastern European countries, part of which did not fulfil the standards developed by the Council of Europe in the field of democracy, respect for human rights and the state of law, were highly controversially discussed within the Council of Europe, in particular in the case of Russia. The organisation finally decided to admit all "European" states, but only on condition of certain obligations and commitments to be undertaken by the applicant states. Thereby the organisation wanted to support the transformation process from within the organisation. This dissertation analyses the particular problems arising out of the wide admission policy. Chapter 2, after the Introduction, gives an overview of the history of the organisation, its relations with the Eastern European states until 1989 and an analysis of the most important issues for the organisation in its attempt to define its role after 1989. The introduction of the <b>special</b> <b>guest</b> <b>status</b> and the different stages in the discussion about the admission policy are analysed with respect to the individual admission candidates. Additionally the position of the Council of Europe in juxtaposition to other {{international organisation}}s such as the OSCE and the EU is examined with regard to their particular comparative advantages and disadvantages. Chapter 3 gives an analysis of the institutional changes within the organisation, with particular attention to the new organ "Council of Local and Regional Authorities", the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights and the commission "Democracy through Law". The central chapter 4 examines the different monitoring procedures within the Council of Europe, part of which had existed before (especially the European Court for Human Rights) whereas others were introduced in the context of the Eastern European states´ admission. The analysis focusses on the monitoring procedure introduced by the Parliamentary Assembly, which presents an innovative approach to ensure the fulfillment of the commitments entered into by the new member states. In addition to the monitoring procedures, special assistance programmes (the so-called ADACS programmes) were introduced by the Council of Europe (chapter 4). The interplay of these different mechanisms is examined in two case studies (chapter 5). The case of Estonia is a positive example for the efficacy of the Council of Europe´s approach, whereas the steps taken by the organisation in reaction to the conflicts in the Russian Republic of Chechnya illustrate the limits of its capacity to act and react...|$|E
