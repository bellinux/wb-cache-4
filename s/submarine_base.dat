5|$|Though {{she would}} remain in port for another three years, Prinz Eugens stay in Pola was enlivened by {{a visit from the}} new Emperor Karl I on 15 December 1916 and another by the German Kaiser Wilhelm II on 12 December 1917 during his {{inspection}} of the German <b>submarine</b> <b>base</b> in the port city.

5|$|Jones {{carried the}} {{football}} {{for a total}} of 700 yards of rushing and scored four touchdowns in 1944, his junior year, and was named an All-American and an All-Southeastern Conference player by sportswriters.

Before beginning his professional career, he played in the 1946 Chicago College All-Star Game, a now-defunct annual contest between the National Football League champion and a squad of the country's best college players.

5|$|Maid Honor, a 65-ton Brixham yacht trawler, left Poole harbour on 9 August 1941, {{bound for}} West Africa. The five man crew {{were under the}} command of March-Phillipps. The {{remainder}} of the SSRF {{under the command of}} Captain Geoffrey Appleyard had departed earlier aboard a troop transport ship. On 20 September 1941 after six weeks under sail Maid Honor arrived at Freetown, Sierra Leone. Freetown was the agreed rendezvous for both groups, Appleyard's party having arrived at the end of August. After Maid Honors arrival in Freetown the search for the German submarine bases started. Sailing into the many rivers and deltas in the area, they failed to locate any submarines or evidence of a <b>submarine</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{other five}} {{submarines}} were scheduled for completion at 12-month intervals. However, {{the series of}} defects and problems encountered during sea trials of the submarines (particularly Collins) resulted in the repeated diversion of resources from those still under construction, adding to delays. Consequently, delivery of the submarines ran significantly behind schedule; submarines were presented to the RAN between 21and 41months late, and the entire class was not cleared for full operational service until March 2004, {{a year after the}} last boat was commissioned. These delays forced the RAN to keep several Oberon-class submarines and the <b>submarine</b> <b>base</b> HMAS Platypus in service beyond their planned decommissioning dates.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} in early 1915, U-1 returned to training duties through 4 October. She was stationed at Trieste in early November and conducted reconnaissance cruises from that port through December 1917, {{when she was}} assigned to the naval base at Pola. On 11 January 1918, she was declared obsolete, but was retained as a training boat at the <b>submarine</b> <b>base</b> on Brioni. U-1 was at Pola at the war's end, and was scrapped after her cession to Italy as a war reparation in 1920. U-1 did not sink any ships during the war.|$|E
5|$|After making {{way to the}} <b>submarine</b> <b>base</b> at Brioni, U-41 set out {{on another}} patrol into the Mediterranean on 29 August, but put into Sebenico the next day for engine repairs. Resuming her patrol after a day's delay, U-41 reached her patrol area east of Malta. Wolf and U-41 scored their first success on 13 September, when they torpedoed and sank the steamer Amiral Charner west of Pantellaria. The 4,604-ton French ship was {{carrying}} horses and a general cargo from Marseilles for Salonika when she was attacked. Six {{were killed in the}} attack on the French ship. On 26 September, U-41 attacked another steamer west of Kefalonia, but was apparently unsuccessful. U-41 ended her patrol at Cattaro on 28 September.|$|E
