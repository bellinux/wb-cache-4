40|$|The {{surveillance}} {{program for}} 3013 containers is based, in part, on the <b>separation</b> of <b>containers</b> into various bins related to potential container failure mechanisms. The containers {{are assigned to}} bins based on moisture content and pre-storage estimates of content chemistry. While moisture content is measured during the packaging of each container, chemistry estimates are made by {{using a combination of}} process knowledge, packaging data and prompt gamma analyses to establish the moisture and chloride/fluoride content of the materials. Packages with high moisture and chloride/fluoride contents receive more detailed surveillances than packages with less chloride/fluoride and/or moisture. Moisture verification measurements and chemical analyses performed during the surveillance program provided an opportunity to validate the binning process. Validation results demonstrated that the binning effort was generally successful in placing the containers in the appropriate bin for surveillance and analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of an intelligent decision support system borrows concepts from two fields: software engineering and knowledge engineering. Yet the development processes of the purely technical components {{of the system and}} of the knowledge base of the DSS are very different in terms of development time, paradigms, tools, technical evolutions and the expertise required by the developer. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach taking these fundamental differences into consideration. The novelty of this bipartite approach lies in the clear and generic <b>separation</b> between the <b>container</b> of the DSS (responsible for the software engineering part) and the contents of the DSS (responsible for the knowledge engineering part) ...|$|R

A strip of filter paper (aka [...] "wick") is put into the chamber so that its bottom touches the solvent and the paper lies on the chamber wall and reaches almost {{to the top of the}} container. The container is closed with a cover glass or any other lid and is left for a few minutes to let the solvent vapors ascend the filter paper and saturate the air in the chamber. (Failure to saturate the chamber will result in poor separation and non-reproducible results).|$|R
40|$|Most heavy goods {{vehicles}} in service today are fitted with add-on aerodynamic devices. The most common {{of which is}} the cab-mounted roof deflector. Such devices provide appreciable drag savings, however, they are often not optimised for the trailer. When a wind yaw angle is present, their savings also diminish as the yaw angle increases. The work conducted within this thesis investigated the possibility of using an adjustable deflector for active flow control. The optimum deflector height for a given trailer height was initially investigated using wind tunnel testing. The variation of this optimum with yaw angle and <b>container</b> <b>separation</b> was then investigated. From the results a 3 D look-up table was generated. A control scheme was proposed that used the 3 D look-up table requiring only three measurable inputs. The three inputs required were: the wind yaw angle, the container height and the <b>container</b> <b>separation.</b> A pressure differential located on the deflector was found to linearly relate to the wind yaw angle. This relationship allowed on-road measurement of the wind yaw angle and therefore enabled the development of a prototype controller. Extensive on-road testing and unsteady computational simulation were conducted. The results obtained indicated a mean yaw angle magnitude of around 5 perturbed by four fundamental low frequencies. These frequencies were identified in the runs conducted over the test period and an average frequency established. Higher frequency disturbances were attributed to the wakes of leading heavy goods vehicles and were filtered by a suitably chosen numerical filter. Finally, an estimation of the efficiency of the active device was made using a combination of simulation and full scale testing. From the results obtained, an optimised deflector generated an average drag reduction of 7. 4 %. An estimated additional drag reduction of 1. 9 % over the optimised deflector was predicted through use of an active system...|$|R
40|$|Container {{terminal}} (CT) {{operations are}} often bottlenecked by slow YC (yard crane) movements. Efficient YC scheduling {{to reduce the}} PM waiting time is therefore critical in increasing a CTs throughput. This paper develops an efficient continuous time MILP model for YC scheduling. The model treats realistic operational constraints such as multiple inter-crane interference, fixed YC <b>separation</b> distances, simultaneous <b>container</b> storage/retrievals, realistic YC acceleration/deceleration stages and gantry time, and require far fewer integer variables than previous work. The model significantly improves the solution quality compared to the existing discrete time models and other heuristics found in the literature. Using heuristics and a rolling-horizon algorithm, our model can solve actual container yard (CY) problems quickly and robustly in polynomial time. Also, {{to cope with the}} last minute container arrivals which can disrupt routine CT operations, two methods for handling these last minute job insertions are discussed and compare...|$|R
40|$|Although {{idealized}} {{calculations of}} the potential for an atomic explosion within a repository can make headlines, a more technically useful assessment is a systematic, multidisciplinary, integrated analysis that uses a set of consistent assumptions of disposal system performance. The analysis described here, called a performance assessment, employs the same general approach to study the potential of a critical mass assembly as has been used to examine other potentially disruptive sce-narios in a nuclear waste disposal system. This report presents one of two approachesâ€”bounding calculations-which were used in a major study in 1994 to examine the possibility of a criticality in a repository. The bounding probabilities in this study are rough and do not entirely dismiss the pos-sibility of a critical condition; however, they do point to the difficulty of creating conditions under which a critical mass could be assembled (i. e., corrosion of <b>containers,</b> <b>separation</b> of neutron absorbers from the fissile material, and collapse or precipitation of the fissile material) and, more important, how significant the geochemical and hydrologic phenomena are in examining this criti-cality issue. Furthermore, the study could not conceive of a mechanism that was consistent with conditions under which an atomic explosion could occur, i. e., first, the manner in which. fissil...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTime-dependent {{swirling}} flows {{inside an}} enclosed cylindrical rotor-stator cavity with aspect ratio H/R = 4, {{larger than the}} ones usually considered in the literature, are studied. Within a certain range of governing parameters, vortex breakdown phenomena can arise along the axis. Very recent papers exhibiting some particular three-dimensional effects have stimulated new interest in this topic. The study is carried out by a numerical resolution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, based on high-order spectral approximations {{in order to ensure}} very high accuracy of the solutions. The first transition to an oscillatory regime occurs through an axisymmetric bifurcation (a supercritical Hopf bifurcation) at Re = 3500. The oscillatory regime is caused by an axisymmetric mode of centrifugal instability of the vertical boundary layer and the vortex breakdown is axisymmetric, being composed of two stationary bubbles. For Reynolds numbers up to Re = 3500, different three-dimensional solutions are identified. At Re = 4000, the flow supports the k = 5 mode of centrifugal instability. By increasing the rotation speed to Re = 4500, the vortex breakdown evolves to an S-shaped type after a long computational time. The structure is asymmetric and gyrates around the axis inducing a new time-dependent regime. At Re = 5500, the structure of the vortex breakdown is more complex: {{the upper part of the}} structure takes a spiral form. The maximum rotation speed is reached at Re = 10000 and the flow behaviour is now chaotic. The upper structure of the breakdown can be related to the spiral-type. Asymmetric flow <b>separation</b> on the <b>container</b> wall in the form of spiral arms of different angles is also prominent...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a summary of}} the experimental, analytical, and numerical results of the Capillary Flow Experiment (CFE) performed aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The experiments were conducted in space beginning with Increment 9 through Increment 16, beginning August 2004 and ending December 2007. Both primary and extra science experiments were conducted during 19 operations performed by 7 astronauts including: M. Fincke, W. McArthur, J. Williams, S. Williams, M. Lopez-Alegria, C. Anderson, and P. Whitson. CFE consists of 6 approximately 1 to 2 kg handheld experiment units designed to investigate a selection of capillary phenomena of fundamental and applied importance, such as large length scale contact line dynamics (CFE-Contact Line), critical wetting in discontinuous structures (CFE-Vane Gap), and capillary flows and passive phase <b>separations</b> in complex <b>containers</b> (CFE-Interior Corner Flow). Highly quantitative video from the simply performed flight experiments provide data helpful in benchmarking numerical methods, confirming theoretical models, and guiding new model development. In an extensive executive summary, a brief history of the experiment is reviewed before introducing the science investigated. A selection of experimental results and comparisons with both analytic and numerical predictions is given. The subsequent chapters provide additional details of the experimental and analytical methods developed and employed. These include current presentations {{of the state of the}} data reduction which we anticipate will continue throughout the year and culminate in several more publications. An extensive appendix is used to provide support material such as an experiment history, dissemination items to date (CFE publication, etc.), detailed design drawings, and crew procedures. Despite the simple nature of the experiments and procedures, many of the experimental results may be practically employed to enhance the design of spacecraft engineering systems involving capillary interface dynamics...|$|R
40|$|What are the delays, {{number of}} {{infeasible}} routes and costs {{due to a}} broken lock or vessel accident during a given length {{of time on the}} Dutch inland waterways. If needed only a region of influence will be calculated {{and there will be a}} <b>separation</b> of <b>container</b> and bulk. Multiple analyzes are made of different incident with time stretching from the incidents till the situation returns to normal again to determine the robustness of the system. The expectation is that the flow of goods will increase in the upcoming years. To avoid extra traffic on the road and to achieve the environment targets a giant growth is needed of inland navigation. Due to the arrival of the "tweede maasvlakte" the number of transported containers will quadruple between now and 2035. The growth of inland waterway transport can cause an increase in the number of bottlenecks and the possibility of an accident if capacity cannot accommodate the expected growth. The consequences of such an incident (broken down locks and vessels that got stuck) have been unknown until now. This is why a model is built to analyze the congestion on the Dutch waterways in the next 30 years. Available data dated from 2004 extrapolated to 2008 about the network and ship route intensity is available from the BIVAS model. Different papers based on scenarios help to provide additional information and useful data for extrapolation. On a large scale the BIVAS model and on a local scale the SIVAK model exists. The focus of the new model lies somewhere in between these models. The additional value of this new model is that it is able to analyze a small window of time and the dynamical behavior. This means ships will take into account what other ships are doing. Depending on the interest of the user and calculation speed a set of vessel types can be chosen and simulated without all other types. The scenarios that are evaluated are selected by the user and both container and bulk transportation can be analyzed. The implementation techniques make use of a Markov model where advantages and downsides will be evaluated to see how well this model solves the problem. In order to draw conclusions about the results Monte-Carlo simulations will be used and the results will be visualized using a map of the Netherlands. Within one scenario the time of delay due to taking an alternative route and the amount of vessels that have nowhere to go will be specified. The duration of the simulation will be from the moment the incident takes place till the time the situation returns to normal again. This normal state will be defined using a simulation without an incident. The model assumes a static initial state which means that seasons, water levels, ice and intensities in high and low seasons are neglected. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Nontuberculous {{mycobacteria}} (NTM) {{are emerging}} opportunistic pathogens whose role in {{human and animal}} disease is increasingly being recognized. Major concerns are their role as opportunistic pathogens in HIV/AIDS infections. The role of open natural water sources as source and livestock/wildlife as reservoirs of infections to man are well documented. This presents a health challenge to the pastoral systems in Africa that rely mostly on open natural water sources to meet livestock and human needs. Recent study in the pastoral areas of Uganda showed infections with same genotypes of NTM in pastoralists and their livestock. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the environmental, animal husbandry and socio-demographic factors associated with occurrence and the pastoral community knowledge of mycobacterial infections at the human-environment-livestock/wildlife interface (HELI) areas in pastoral ecosystems of Uganda. Methods Two hundred and fifty three (253) individuals were subjected to a questionnaire survey across the study districts of Nakasongola and Mubende. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results Humans sharing of the water sources with wild animals from the forest compared to savannah ecosystem (OR = 3. 3), the tribe of herding pastoral community (OR = 7. 9), number of rooms present in household (3 - 5 vs. 1 - 2 rooms) (OR = 3. 3) were the socio-demographic factors that influenced the level of knowledge on mycobacterial infections among the pastoral communities. Tribe (OR = 6. 4), use of spring vs. stream water for domestic use (OR = 4. 5), presence of sediments in household water receptacle (OR = 2. 32), non <b>separation</b> of water <b>containers</b> for drinking and domestic use (OR = 2. 46), sharing of drinking water sources with wild animals (OR = 2. 1), duration of involvement of > 5 yrs in cattle keeping (OR = 3. 7) and distance of household to animal night shelters (> 20 meters) (OR = 3. 8) were significant socio-demographic factors associated with the risk of occurrence of mycobacterioses among the pastoral communities in Uganda. Conclusion The socio-demographic, environmental and household related factors influence the risk of occurrence as well as pastoralists' knowledge of mycobacterial infections in the pastoral households at the human-environment-livestock/wildlife pastoral interface areas of Uganda. </p...|$|R
40|$|Material {{separation}} {{technology is}} {{critical to the success of}} the material recycling industry. End-of-life products, post-consumer waste, industrial excess, or otherwise collected materials for reuse are typically mixed with other incompatible materials. These materials must be segregated using material separation processes. This thesis investigates the performance and design of material separation systems for recycling through modeling material flows within these systems. The material separation system models developed here are suited to material recycling because they encompass all types of separation process and any configuration of those processes as well as treat binary and multi-material streams. These models capture the material behavior of separation systems through mass ow balance equations constructed using system configuration and process performance data. The Bayesian material separation model is used to capture the performance of separation stages processing a binary material mixture, while the material separation matrix model, developed here, captures the performance of stages processing multi-material mixtures. A network routing model is used to describe the links between processes within a separation system. The governing mass ow balance equations constructed from the process performance and routing data form systems of linear equations. These equations can be generated and solved programatically. Separation performance can be captured through experimental methods or through physical modeling, but an investigation with either suggests that performance can vary under differing material input conditions and operational settings. Techniques for coping with these effects and potentially using them to tailor system behavior are discussed in a case study on the magnetic roller <b>separation</b> of beverage <b>container</b> shreds. Two case studies use tailored economic metrics to evaluate decisions in the design of separation systems. The effects of operating decisions on an existing plastic container separating line are quantified by evaluating the additional profit from plastics-capture decisions. The second case study investigates the economics of installing a plastics separating line at an energy from waste facility. Modeling suggests several possible configurations for a plastics separating line that outperform configurations suggested by industry experts, showing that the material separation system models developed in this work can provide design guidance in the recycling industry. by Malima Isabelle Wolf.
