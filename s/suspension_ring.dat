25|$|Other {{works of}} art such as the crowns of light (circular chandeliers) made in cast bronze, dating from the Fatimid-Zirid period (around tenth-early {{eleventh}} century), originally belonged to the furniture of the mosque. These polycandelons, now scattered in various Tunisian museums including Raqqada, consist of three chains supporting a perforated brass plate, which has a central circular ring around which radiate 18 equidistant poles connected by many horseshoe arches and equipped for each of two landmarks flared. The three chains, connected by a <b>suspension</b> <b>ring,</b> are each fixed to the plate by an almond-shaped finial. The crowns of light are marked by Byzantine influence to which the Kairouanese artisan brought the specificities of Islamic decorative repertoire (geometric and floral motifs).|$|E
500|$|The medal {{consists}} of a bronze cross pattée, with {{the center of each}} arm extended in a semi-circular shape and {{in the center of the}} front is the word [...] "BREVET", encircled by the words [...] "UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS". A small five-pointed star, point-up, is at the bottom center of the circle formed by the inscription and a small Marine Corps insignia (eagle, globe and anchor) attaches the medal to its <b>suspension</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Army {{version is}} {{described}} by the Institute of Heraldry as [...] "a gold five pointed star, each point tipped with trefoils, [...] wide, surrounded by a green laurel wreath and suspended from a gold bar inscribed VALOR, surmounted by an eagle. In {{the center of the}} star, Minerva's head surrounded by the words UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. On each ray of the star is a green oak leaf. On the reverse is a bar engraved THE CONGRESS TO with a space for engraving the name of the recipient." [...] The pendant and suspension bar are made of gilding metal, with the eye, jump rings, and <b>suspension</b> <b>ring</b> made of red brass. The finish on the pendant and suspension bar is hard enameled, gold plated, and rose gold plated, with polished highlights.|$|E

50|$|The {{third variety}} was {{manufactured}} by William Dibble, Gerrards, London {{in the early}} 1950s. These medals were cast frosted silver second type medals, with very small <b>suspension</b> <b>rings,</b> sterling silver hallmarks and WJD {{on the bottom of}} the reverse. Intended primarily as replacement medals, most were sold to collectors with SPECIMEN impressed on the rim.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} comprised nine-layered {{leaf springs}} with {{a length of}} 1,650 mm and {{a cross section of}} 120 mm x 16 mm. The springs were attached to their supports by means of rectangular <b>suspension</b> <b>rings.</b> The vehicles had an axle base of 7,000 mm. The external sole bars had a strut frame as additional bracing.|$|R
2500|$|Suspension is {{by means}} of a ribbon through a <b>suspension</b> <b>ring</b> passing through the orb of a pivot mounted crown. [...] The green silk moiré ribbon has two 5mm wide red stripes set 1mm from the ribbon's edges. [...] The Military Cross First Class differs only from the second class award {{in the form of a}} rosette on the ribbon in the same colours as the ribbon.|$|E
2500|$|The World War I Croix de guerre was a 40mm wide bronze Maltese cross with 3mm in {{diameter}} balls at its eight points. [...] It had a 14mm {{in diameter}} central medallion bearing the relief {{image of a}} [...] "lion rampant" [...] on its obverse and the royal cypher of King Albert I on its reverse. [...] Two 37mm long crossed swords point upwards between it arms. [...] A 14mm high [...] "inverted V" [...] between the two points of the top cross arm is secured {{to the inside of}} a 25mm wide by 25mm high royal crown, the ribbon's <b>suspension</b> <b>ring</b> passes through the top orb of the crown giving the cross a total height of 65mm.|$|E
50|$|The officers' and commanders' badges also bear a gilt wreath, half vine {{and half}} olive branch, between the {{insignia}} and the ribbon <b>suspension</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
50|$|The pugio was {{accommodated}} {{in its own}} sheath. By {{the second}} quarter of the 1st century AD three types of sheath were in use. All of these had four <b>suspension</b> <b>rings</b> and a bulbous terminal expansion which is pierced by a large rivet. Both depictional evidence and the evidence of wear patterns on surviving examples show that the two lower rings were unused. The first type (type 'A') was made with a curving metal (normally iron) plate at both front and back, surrounding a wooden 'lining'. The front plate was usually heavily decorated with inlaid brass, silver, niello and red, yellow or green enamel. These sheaths featured round free-running <b>suspension</b> <b>rings,</b> attached by bifurgated mountings which were riveted on. Modern reconstructions of these sheaths which feature applied brass plates attached by rivets are incorrect and nothing of this type has ever been found. This common mistake is derived from a misinterpretation of a line drawing in an archaeological report of an iron type 'A' sheath decorated with silver inlay and decorative rivets. The second type (type 'B') was a wooden sheath, probably covered with leather to the front of which a metal (almost always iron) plate had been attached. This plate was fairly flat and was heavily decorated with inlaid silver (or occasionally tin) and enamel. The <b>suspension</b> <b>rings</b> resembled small Roman military buckles and were hinged to the sides of the sheath. The third type ('frame type') was made of iron and consisted of a pair of curved channels which ran together {{at the lower end of}} the sheath, where they were worked into a flattened round terminal expansion. The channels were joined by two horizontal bands at the top and middle of the sheath and these bands also retained the <b>suspension</b> <b>rings,</b> which were round like those of type 'A' sheaths. These sheaths would have been built around a wooden core, which does not survive in the archaeological record.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{element of}} a wOOx Technology speaker system is the bass {{radiator}}. The wOOx bass radiator (referred to in marketing literature as the wOOx-Slave) is functionally indistinguishable from typical [...] "passive radiator" [...] diaphragms previously employed in loudspeaker systems. Early wOOx radiators used a patented design with two foam-rubber <b>suspension</b> <b>rings</b> instead of the typical single ring, and a symmetrical sandwich construction.|$|R
50|$|The two sheaths {{pictured in}} the {{photographs}} accompanying this article are both incorrect {{and should not be}} used as references. There is also no evidence for sheaths being suspended from straps, as shown in the two pictures. Contemporary depictions show sheaths attached directly to military belts, with the upper <b>suspension</b> <b>rings</b> in line with the belt and attached very closely to the buttons of the 'frog plates' worn on the belt, often closely enough to be touching.|$|R
5000|$|The medal {{hangs from}} a silk moiré tricolour ribbon {{composed}} of three equal blue-white-red vertical stripes. [...] The wartime award includes a wreath of oak leaves with two crossed swords on the <b>suspension</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Grand Cross {{was awarded}} {{at least once}} with crossed marshals' batons, as was awarded to Paul von Hindenburg. The crossed batons were worn above the Maltese cross badge of the Grand Cross, on its <b>suspension</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Variant sword types {{with the}} {{standard}} trooper's blade, but a bowl hilt {{similar to that of}} the officers' pattern, in brass with a brass scabbard (for the Life Guards) or iron with an iron scabbard (for the Horse Guards), exist and are believed to have been issued to the other ranks of the Household regiments for use when on home (ceremonial) service. [...] The scabbards of these swords did not usually have <b>suspension</b> <b>rings,</b> but were fitted with a button or slide for use with a 'frog' - a type of baldric or belt attachment. It is known that the Household regiments employed the standard trooper's pattern swords on active service.|$|R
50|$|Officers {{carried the}} {{infantry}} officer's sabre, which was 82 cm long {{and had a}} hollow grind on both sides. At the tip the blade was double-edged. The scabbard was made of brass and fitted with a sharpening iron (Schleifeisen). Two iron <b>suspension</b> <b>rings</b> were fastened to the scabbard in order to hang it from the sword belt. The sabre was always carried buckled underneath. The sword knot of the sabre was made of gold thread and consisted of a tassel and strap. The tassel was made of dangling knots (Bouillons) that were gold {{on the outside and}} black inside. This sabre was carried by ensigns and orderly sergeants (dienstführenden Feldwebeln).|$|R

50|$|The medal {{hung from}} a 36mm wide silk moiré green ribbon with a 7mm white central stripe and two 2mm wide white stripes 1mm from the ribbon edges. The medal <b>suspension</b> <b>ring</b> was adorned by a silver laurel wreath and a crescent.|$|E
5000|$|For 50 {{years of}} service, a Red Eagle {{recipient}} received the [...] "Jubilee Number" [...] (Jubiläumszahl), a round medallion {{with the number}} [...] "50" [...] on it, affixed to the <b>suspension</b> <b>ring</b> or to the oak leaves or the ring of the bow, if applicable.|$|E
2500|$|Despite being a {{well-known}} artifact of the Yayoi era, {{the concept of}} dotaku did not initially originate in Japan. According to several studies, these bells {{are thought to be}} derived from [...] "earlier, smaller Korean examples that adorned horses and other domesticated animals", from Chinese cattle bells, or Han Chinese zhong, which were bells without clappers used for composing ritual music. However, further studies show that the Yayoi did not have cattle farms, and although several dotaku do have <b>suspension</b> <b>rings</b> and clappers, they make [...] "muffled tones" [...] or [...] "rattling sounds" [...] when struck, suggesting that they were not meant to be rung. [...] Therefore, any bells from China were imported as ritual objects.|$|R
50|$|Baguenaudier (also {{known as}} the Chinese <b>Rings,</b> Cardan's <b>Suspension,</b> Cardano's <b>Rings,</b> Devil's needle or five pillars puzzle) is a disentanglement puzzle {{featuring}} a loop which must be disentangled from a sequence of rings on interlinked pillars. The loop can be either string or a rigid structure.|$|R
2500|$|The sword {{was often}} {{modified}} by its users. The point was originally a 'hatchet point', a curved diagonal front edge {{similar to that}} of the Japanese katana, but most were altered to a symmetrical 'spear point', more common at the time, or alternatively made more acute whilst retaining the asymmetry of the tip. This was done in order to improve the sword's ability to thrust. Quite large numbers of spear-pointed examples exist with [...] blades, along with an appropriately shortened scabbard. These may be conversions of the original standard [...] blade, although many appear to have been manufactured to this shorter length. The sword was carried in an iron scabbard with wooden liners, [...] and hung from the waist via sword-belt slings attached to two loose <b>suspension</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The medal {{hung from}} a dark blue silk moiré ribbon adorned with 2 mm wide red oblique (from low left to high right) stripes {{separated}} by 4 mm. The ribbon passed through a rectangular rigid <b>suspension</b> <b>ring</b> struck {{as an integral part}} of the cross.|$|E
50|$|The {{badge of}} the {{fraternity}} is a gold key {{consisting of the}} crossed letters, Tau Sigma Delta, a <b>suspension</b> <b>ring</b> {{at the top and}} a pendant at the bottom. The crossed letters of the same arrangement as on the key is the crest of the fraternity.|$|E
50|$|The ribbon <b>suspension</b> <b>ring</b> was {{adorned with}} a 20mm high by 25mm wide bronze twisted dragon. The ring passed through a loop atop the medal which hung from a 39mm wide green ribbon bearing four 5mm wide yellow stripes set 5mm apart {{starting}} 2mm from the edges.|$|E
50|$|The medal is {{suspended}} from a claw <b>suspension</b> with a <b>ring</b> through its ribbon. The ribbon is yellow with edges of red.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fabrication}} process involved several North American factories specializing in hand-craftsmanship. There are {{several layers of}} nets in the sculpture. The main body of colored net including the [...] "wormhole" [...] at the center, a structural net, which helps give the primary net its shape, and a cover net. The edge of every mesh is a different length, requiring the use of manual splicing on each joint. The two shortest steel support towers were shipped to the site complete; the third tower was shipped in halves, which were assembled and welded on-site. The <b>suspension</b> <b>rings</b> were created by a manufacturer specializing in fabricating roller coaster equipment. The rings hang concentrically 100 ft above the ground and are bound together with 1 in. diameter steel cable. The rings are secured {{to the base of}} each support tower with tie-down cables, which provide structural stability against strong winds and minimize ring movement.|$|R
50|$|The medal {{is held by}} a <b>ring</b> <b>suspension</b> {{attached}} to a crown surmounting the medal. The medal is borne upon a crimson ribbon 1.5 in wide, with white borders.|$|R
5000|$|The medal {{hung from}} a 38mm wide green silk moiré ribbon bearing five 1,8mm wide red {{vertical}} stripes spaced 4,5mm apart and 1mm red edge stripes. [...] The ribbon passed through a <b>suspension</b> <b>ring</b> itself passing through a lateral hole in the imperial crown's orb atop the medal.|$|E
5000|$|The medal {{hung from}} a 36 mm wide silk moiré ribbon bearing six 4 mm wide red stripes and five 2 mm wide white stripes.

50|$|The Officer Degree of the Legion of Merit Medal {{is similar}} to the degree of Commander except the overall width is 1+7/8 in and the pendant has a <b>suspension</b> <b>ring</b> instead of the wreath for {{attaching}} the ribbon. A gold replica of the medal, 3/4 in wide, is centered on the suspension ribbon.|$|E
50|$|The GM 9.25 IFS {{has been}} the main front {{differential}} in Four-wheel drive 3/4 Ton and 1 Ton GM trucks since 1988. The Dana 60 solid axle front end was used selectively in trucks with a higher GVWR from 1988-1991. The original Saginaw 9.5 differential, ring and pinion were modified {{to work with the}} independent front <b>suspension.</b> The <b>ring</b> and pinion were also reverse-cut as well.|$|R
50|$|The Special Reserve Long Service and Good Conduct Medal is {{a silver}} 32 mm wide oval shaped medal. The obverse depicts the bust of the reigning King of the United Kingdom.
