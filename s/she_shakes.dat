25|$|Buddy warns Phyllis that Sally {{is still}} in love with Ben, and she is shaken by how the past threatens to repeat itself. Sally is awed by Ben’s {{apparently}} glamorous life, but Ben wonders if he made the right choices and considers how things might have been ("The Road You Didn't Take"). Sally tells Ben how her days have been spent with Buddy, trying to convince him (and herself) ("In Buddy’s Eyes"). But it is clear that Sally {{is still in}} love with Ben – even though their affair ended badly when Ben decided to marry Phyllis. <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> loose from the memory and begins to dance with Ben, who is touched by the memory of the Sally he once cast aside.|$|E
500|$|... "Get Me Bodied" [...] {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics who praised its party sound and Beyoncé's vocals. Chris Richards of The Washington Post {{referred to the}} track a [...] "club-hungry come-ons" [...] with a [...] "dexterous melody". He further stated that the [...] "skeletal" [...] track [...] "keeps Beyoncé tethered to the ground". Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "a piddly home hi-fi can hardly capture the thunderous grandeur of 'Get Me Bodied,' which sets Beyoncé's harmonies above a pummeling track overseen by rap producer Swiss Beatz". Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media called the track a [...] "percussive, Diwali-esque jam". Us Weekly described [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] a [...] "snappy dance number." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker noted that the song sounds [...] "anxious." [...] Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that the song {{is very similar to}} Gwen Stefani's [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] (2005) and expressed further praise about [...] "Get Me Bodied", writing: [...] " [...] Beyonce’s glorified version of a 'Hollaback Girl'-type song. [...] But listen to way she wails and shouts throughout the song! Gwen Stefani certainly isn’t capable of vocal gymnastics like this. When she sings [...] you can visualize beads of perspiration coming off of her as <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> to this song." ...|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins with}} a white screen {{followed}} by a fade-in of a close-up of a bald Björk.

2500|$|The {{story begins}} during a town festival to {{celebrate}} {{the arrival of a}} new bell. The town crier announces that, when it arrives, anyone who becomes married will be awarded a special gift of money. Swanhilda and Franz plan to marry during the festival. However, Swanhilda becomes unhappy with Franz because he seems to be paying more attention to a girl named Coppélia, who sits motionless on the balcony of a nearby house. [...] The house belongs to a mysterious and faintly diabolical inventor, Doctor Coppélius. Although Coppélia spends all of her time sitting motionless and reading, Franz is mesmerized by her beauty and is determined to attract her attention. Still upset with Franz, Swanhilda shakes an ear of wheat to her head: if it rattles, then she will know that Franz loves her. Upon doing this, however, she hears nothing. When <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> it by Franz's head, he also hears nothing; but then he tells her that it rattles. However, she does not believe him and runs away heartbroken.|$|E
2500|$|That night, Charlie Brown {{is still}} sad {{that he has}} not {{discovered}} {{what it means to be}} a [...] "good man", then he discovers a pencil which has been dropped by the Little Red-Haired Girl (his perennial crush). As he examines it, he discovers that [...] "there are teeth-marks all over it [...] [...] [...] she nibbles her pencil [...] [...] [...] she's HUMAN!" [...] With that realization, he concludes that today hasn't been so bad, after all, and he's done a lot of things that make him happy. As Charlie Brown expresses what makes him happy, everyone, touched by his love of life, begin to express what makes them happy as well ("Happiness"). Right then, he realizes being a [...] "good man" [...] means trying your best and making the most of the things you've been given in life. As his other friends leave the stage, Lucy turns to him and puts out her hand, making him shrink back. As he reaches out, <b>she</b> <b>shakes</b> his hand firmly, then tells him, [...] "You're a good man, Charlie Brown." ...|$|E
