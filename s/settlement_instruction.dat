50|$|Securities {{financing}} is {{the ability}} to borrow or lend cash or securities against collateral. In securities financing, collateral comprises assets given as a guarantee by a borrower to secure a securities loan and subject to seizure in the event of default. Collateral management refers to the handling of all tasks related to the monitoring of collateral posted by a borrower to meet a financial obligation (optimisation, substitution, top-up, withdrawal, <b>settlement</b> <b>instruction,</b> reporting, processing of margin calls and returns, notification of corporate events, etc.).|$|E
40|$|Reason {{for change}} / {{expected}} benefits / business case: When a <b>Settlement</b> <b>Instruction</b> is partially settled, T 2 S generates two messages: – Pending Status (sese. 024) {{for the remaining}} unsettled part: contains information about the quantity and amount not settled (UDFS 3. 3. 8. 5). – Settlement Confirmation (sese. 025) for the settled part (UDFS 3. 3. 8. 6. 3) : contains information about Settled quantity and amount Previous settled quantity and amount (if there was a previous partial settlement). Remaining to be settled quantity and amount (if it is not final settlement) In case there is a previous partial settlement confirmation, the message identification of the previous partial settlement confirmation. This is applicable for status notification messages created {{on the basis of}} Settlement Instructions, Intra position movement (UDFS 3. 3. 7. 4) and Intra balance movements (UDFS 3. 3. 3. 22). The tag “Previous Partial Confirmation Identification ” includes the message identification of the confirmation previously sent. On that basis the message identification of the previous partial settlement confirmation would be used to allow the T 2 S Actor to understand the order in which these messages and the respective T 2 S processing wer...|$|E
50|$|In practice, {{where the}} {{investment}} manager is not automated, broker/dealers will often {{not wait for}} the affirmation from the investment manager before notifying their settlement agents and submitting their <b>settlement</b> <b>instructions.</b> In this case, <b>settlement</b> <b>instructions</b> are sent {{on the basis of}} trade details that have not been affirmed and thus risk being incorrect.|$|R

40|$|Reason {{for change}} and {{expected}} benefits/business motivation: In spring 2014 several workshops on volumetric assumptions and timeline of End-of-Day/Start-of-Day took place. Within these workshops the possibilities to query information on all securities positions resp. <b>settlement</b> <b>instructions</b> of a CSD were discussed with the aim to facilitate the CSD’s reconciliation of <b>settlement</b> <b>instructions</b> and securities positions. The option to send several queries (e. g. per account owning party or per instructing party) and to receive for each query one query response was not deemed useful. Instead, the CSDs intend to send one query and to receive one query response. Thus, the need to query securities positions and <b>settlement</b> <b>instructions</b> by CSD has arisen. The participants of the workshop identified the need to retrieve all <b>settlement</b> <b>instructions</b> within the CSD by sending a single query. Similarly, {{there is a need}} to retrieve all securities positions of previous business days on securities accounts of the CSD itself and all its CSD participants by sending a single query. Moreover, it was identified in these workshops that {{there is a need to}} include in a Statement of Pending Instructions not only those <b>Settlement</b> <b>Instructions</b> which expect <b>settlement</b> at the current business day. For complete and delta reports, all <b>Settlement</b> <b>Instructions</b> within the data scope covered by the report shall be taken into account regardless of their intended settlement date. This allows CSDs to correctly reconcile the pending instructions before sending the reportin...|$|R
50|$|PDEx began trading {{operations}} in Government Securities in March 2005, with a Negotiated Dealing System for the Inter-Dealer Market. The system was enhanced {{with the introduction}} of Straight-Through-Processing (STP) in September 2006. The STP facility generates <b>settlement</b> <b>instructions</b> from trades in the centralized transaction data base in the Trading System and publishes them into a secure website for the Operations Personnel of Trading Participants to reconcile and authorize. Once authorized, the <b>settlement</b> <b>instructions</b> are sent through to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), which operates the Delivery-versus-Payment Service for Government Securities with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the Philippine Central bank). The facility eliminates the need for the Operations Personnel to re-enter trade-related <b>settlement</b> <b>instructions</b> into a separate system.|$|R
5000|$|The message also {{includes}} <b>settlement</b> <b>instructions.</b> The actual transfer is not instantaneous: funds may take several hours or even days {{to move from}} the sender's account to the receiver's account.|$|R
5000|$|With manual {{trade the}} {{counterparties}} respond to each other’s messages and the relevant data {{needs to be}} checked and re-keyed manually. There is a strict sequence of steps; each party must wait for the other to complete its actions before proceeding. Only once all the steps in the trade verification process are completed will the <b>settlement</b> <b>instructions</b> be sent and the next stages of post-trade processing begin.|$|R
50|$|Standard <b>Settlement</b> <b>Instructions</b> (SSIs) are the {{agreements}} between two financial institutions which fix the receiving agents of each counterparty in ordinary trades of some type. These agreements allow traders to make faster trades {{since the time}} used to settle the receiving agents is conserved. Limiting the trader to an SSI also lowers {{the likelihood of a}} fraud. SSIs are used by financial institutions to facilitate fast and accurate cross-border payments.|$|R
50|$|Estimates {{show that}} failed trades {{put as much}} as US$976 billion in equity {{transactions}} and $308 billion in fixed income transactions at risk annually. A reduction {{in the risk of}} trade fails implies less time spent on preventing or following up potential or actual fails. Fewer fails mean fewer costs downstream in record-keeping, reconciliations of <b>settlement</b> <b>instructions,</b> corporate actions, claims-handling and other functions required to resolve fails. Therefore, some of the operating cost efficiencies will be passed along the value chain and benefit other parties, not just the investment manager and broker/dealer.|$|R
50|$|At {{the other}} end of the spectrum, central {{matching}} removes much of the sequentially in the trade verification process because the counterparties involved input the relevant data independently and separately. The information is then validated and matched centrally and to a large extent synchronously. When the details match, <b>settlement</b> <b>instructions</b> are automatically sent to custodians and settlement agents. What is more, the counterparties receive updates on the status of trades processed through the system, with errors (and the need to take corrective action) being indicated if trades do not match.|$|R
50|$|Wire {{transfer}}: A {{wire transfer}} is an electronic transfer of funds. Wire transfers {{can be done}} by a simple bank account transfer, or by a transfer of cash at a cash office. Bank wire transfers are often the most expedient method for transferring funds between bank accounts. A bank wire transfer is a message to the receiving bank requesting them to effect payment in accordance with the instructions given. The message also includes <b>settlement</b> <b>instructions.</b> The actual wire transfer itself is virtually instantaneous, requiring no longer for transmission than a telephone call.|$|R

50|$|Throughout this time, Jefferson had {{up-to-date}} {{intelligence on}} Napoleon's military activities and intentions in North America. Part of his evolving strategy involved giving du Pont some {{information that was}} withheld from Livingston. He also gave intentionally conflicting instructions to the two. Desperate to avoid possible war with France, Jefferson sent James Monroe to Paris in 1803 to negotiate a <b>settlement,</b> with <b>instructions</b> to go to London to negotiate an alliance if the talks in Paris failed. Spain procrastinated until late 1802 in executing the treaty to transfer Louisiana to France, which allowed American hostility to build. Also, Spain's refusal to cede Florida to France meant that Louisiana would be indefensible. Monroe had been formally expelled from France on his last diplomatic mission, and the choice to send him again conveyed a sense of seriousness.|$|R
40|$|Reverse {{bifurcation}} is a {{trial procedure}} in which the jury determines damages first, before determining liability. The liability phase of the trial rarely occurs, because the parties usually settle once they know {{the value of the}} case.

This article explains the history of the procedure and analyzes why it encourages <b>settlements,</b> simplifies jury <b>instructions,</b> and produces better outcomes for the parties...|$|R
50|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the insurgency, Pugachev's generals carried out mass recruitment campaigns in Tatar and Bashkir <b>settlements,</b> with the <b>instructions</b> of recruiting one member from every or every other household and as many weapons as they could secure. He recruited not only Cossacks, but Russian peasants and factory workers, Tatars, Bashkirs, Chuvash. Famous Bashkir hero Salawat Yulayev joined him. Pugachev’s primary target for his campaign was not the people themselves, but their leaders. He recruited priests and mullahs to disseminate his decrees and read them to the masses as a way of lending them credence.|$|R

Ikeji town is populated largely by three groups: the Iras, the Ipos and the Ikejis (they are Ijesha settlers). Unlike in other Yorubas community, these three groups have lived together {{for over a century}} (from their times in Ikeji Ile) without any communal clash or war.|$|R
