It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
25|$|If orgasm is desired, anorgasmia may be {{attributed}} to an inability to relax. It may be associated with performance pressure and an unwillingness to pursue pleasure, as separate from the other person's satisfaction; often, women worry <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pleasure of their partner that they become anxious, which manifests as impatience with the delay of orgasm for them. This delay can lead to frustration of not reaching orgasmic sexual satisfaction. Psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, in his 1927 book Die Funktion des Orgasmus (published in English in 1980 as Genitality in the Theory and Therapy of Neurosis) was the first to make orgasm central to the concept of mental health, and defined neurosis in terms of blocks to having orgastic potency. Although orgasm dysfunction can have psychological components, physiological factors often play a role. For instance, delayed orgasm or the inability to achieve orgasm is a common side effect of many medications.|$|E

[...] When addressing speculation that the conflict was fabricated for television, Conrad stated that [...] "I wouldn't fight for the camera. If anything I would try not to." [...] In a separate interview, she revealed that she almost quit the program before the season began, stating [...] "it wasn't <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> filming, but I didn't want to do a show with the other people on it", which was assumed to be alluding to Montag and Pratt.|$|E

After an {{unsuccessful}} first show in which none of her work sold, Nevelson had a falling out with gallery owner Janis over sums he advanced her {{and was unable to}} recoup. Nevelson and Janis entered into a contentious legal battle that left Nevelson broke, depressed, and at risk of becoming homeless. However, at this time Nevelson was offered a funded, six-week artist fellowship at Tamarind Lithography Workshop (now Tamarind Institute) in Los Angeles, which allowed her to escape the drama of New York City. She explained, [...] "I wouldn't ordinarily have gone.

500|$|A small {{elite of}} black urbanites, mostly raised and educated at Christian missions, existed in Southern Rhodesia {{by the time}} of the war, and these {{generally}} identified themselves strongly with settler society and, by extension, the war effort. But the vast majority of black people in the colony retained their traditional tribal lifestyles of rural subsistence farming, and for most of them, as McLaughlin comments, the war [...] "could have been fought between aliens from different planets for all their connection with events in Europe". Some felt obliged to [...] "fight for their country", seeing the travails of Rhodesia and the Empire as their own also, but the great bulk of tribal public opinion was detached, seeing the conflict as a [...] "white man's war" [...] that did not concern them. Those who favoured the latter line of thinking cared not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> conflict itself but more about how its course might affect them specifically. For example, widespread interest was aroused soon after the outbreak of war when rumours began to fly between the rural black communities that the Company planned to conscript them. News of the Maritz Rebellion prompted a fresh rumour among the Matabele that Company officials might confiscate tribal livestock to feed the white troops going south. None of this actually occurred.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Nas {{released}} his tenth studio album Distant Relatives, a collaboration with Damian Marley that reinvigorated the rapper creatively. He soon became distracted by tax problems and an expensive, highly publicized divorce {{from his wife}} Kelis months before their son's birth, events that influenced his direction for Life Is Good. His songwriting on the album was also influenced by adjusting back to life as a single man. Nas also wanted to write more original subject matter rather than another album [...] "about how you {{came up in the}} hood and how you had to make it out of the hood". Although he did not find his album [...] "quite <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> marriage or the divorce", Nas likened Life Is Good to Marvin Gaye's 1978 album Here, My Dear, which was written by Gaye in response to his own deteriorating marriage and released as a financial settlement. For Life Is Goods album cover, a photo was taken of Nas in a polished white suit, sitting in a night club's VIP lounge, appearing forlorn, and holding over his knee Kelis' actual green wedding dress, which he said was the only item she left him. When writing the album, Nas also reflected on aging and maturation, fatherhood, and his 20-year experience in hip hop music.

500|$|... "Kicking and Screaming" [...] is {{the most}} {{prominent}} representation of rock music on The Time of Our Lives. The track features instrumentation that relies on glam electric guitar riffing and ragged, gutsy vocals, which, at several points, feature a gravelly element. It results in an uptempo electronic rock number. Lyrically, [...] "Kicking and Screaming" [...] is a merciless message to an ex-boyfriend. [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] mixes R and pop music elements while having instrumentation that includes a [...] "clash between feathery jazz guitar chords and a booming synth bassline serving as a hook". Cyrus' vocals display an undertone of alternative country twang and features belter refrains. The lyrics for [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] discuss Cyrus' relocation from Nashville, Tennessee to Hollywood, California. The refrains mainly speak of how her favorite songs make her feel more confident. [...] "When I Look at You" [...] is a power ballad that transitions in instrumentation, from piano to electric guitar. Throughout the song, Cyrus keeps a hushed tone, but starts to belt soon {{before the arrival of}} the second verse. Lyrically, it speaks of a dream lover. [...] "The Time of Our Lives" [...] is a bouncy, dance-pop song characterized by 1980s synths and a fizzy sound caused by a bubblegum pop background. Cyrus' processed vocals display a prominent use of auto-tune; influences derive from new wave music. The song's lyrics talk about not worrying <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future and simply focusing on the present and having a good time together. [...] "Talk Is Cheap" [...] is a pop-punk, garage rock song with disco influences and a number of hooks. [...] "Talk Is Cheap" [...] features lyrics that speak of being extremely irritated after encountering predicaments at a club and others smoking cigarettes. [...] "Obsessed" [...] is a power ballad with soft rock characteristics and husky vocals. [...] "Obsessed"'s lyrics deal with teenage lust. [...] "Before the Storm" [...] is a country pop ballad about a melancholic romantic breakup.|$|E
500|$|Scholars and {{academics}} have offered many possible readings of American Beauty; film critics are similarly divided, not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{quality of the}} film, as their interpretations of it. Described by many as about [...] "the meaning of life" [...] or [...] "the hollow existence of the American suburbs", the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers. Mendes is indecisive, saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it: [...] "a mystery story, a kaleidoscopic journey through American suburbia, a series of love stories; it was about imprisonment, loneliness, [...] beauty. It was funny; it was angry, sad." [...] The literary critic and author Wayne C. Booth concludes that the film resists any one interpretation: [...] " [...] cannot be adequately summarized as 'here is a satire on what's wrong with American life'; that plays down the celebration of beauty. It is more tempting to summarize it as 'a portrait of the beauty underlying American miseries and misdeeds', but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror, and Ball's disgust with our mores. It cannot be summarized with either Lester or Ricky's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live." [...] He argues {{that the problem of}} interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center—a controlling voice who [...] " [...] all of the choices". He contends that in American Beautys case, it is neither Mendes nor Ball. Mendes considers the voice to be Ball's, but even while the writer was [...] "strongly influential" [...] on set, he often had to accept deviations from his vision, particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic. With [...] "innumerable voices intruding on the original author's," [...] Booth says, those who interpret American Beauty [...] "have forgotten to probe for the elusive center". According to Booth, the film's true controller is the creative energy [...] "that hundreds of people put into its production, agreeing and disagreeing, inserting and cutting".|$|E
