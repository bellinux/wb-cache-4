40|$|International audienceFrance has {{recently}} undergone a teacher training reform (2010 - 2011), {{in the context}} of the Bologna Process, which started in 2002. We are still in the early stages of this reform today. It was carried out in an extremely tense context with universities and politicians being very critical of the IUFM (Instituts de Formation des Maîtres, which were the only structure in charge of teacher training), and even the former French president himself publicly asserting they had disappeared. At the same time, the drastic reduction in the number of teachers in primary and secondary schools (because of the government’s policy of the reducing the number of State-employed) gave this reform a financial dimension and therefore strengthened opposition to it. And indeed, this reform has brought very strong, although sometimes contradictory, opposition from different actors. On the one hand, the faculties (UFR) *, and above all history faculties, which had previously been in charge of initial training in the different disciplines, were afraid for the future of their research masters (which would be in competition with the vocational masters); and on the other hand, the IUFM which were in danger of disappearing and who argued in favour of vocational masters. The reform in teacher training profoundly affected the universities, where didactics was traditionally poorly considered (and this was particularly true in faculties for humanities and social sciences). Very few departments (such as the Centre de Formation et d’Études sur l’Enseignement des Disciplines, CFEED) de Paris 7 -Denis Diderot) provided training and research in didactics and, after the Ph D, the specialists of history didactics could only find positions in the IUFM (at the time these institutions were independent schools, outside the universities). To add to these difficulties, the reform of teacher training {{in the context of}} the Bologna Process was at odds with the traditional mode of teacher recruitment. In France, teachers are State-employed and have to pass a very competitive exam, the CAPES*, considered as an important element of Republican democracy. The future of this exam was questioned in the reform. Moreover, at the same time the government announced a very important reduction in the time devoted to training newly qualified teachers (<b>stagiaires),</b> and this caused further outcry (for example from the trade unions). For all these reasons, the introduction of masters in teacher training courses was a very controversial process, and recent studies, commissioned by the very government who conducted this reform seem to confirm some of the criticisms. To understand the reform and the problems it has created, we have first to consider the academic context in which it took place, together with the place of this discipline, which is traditionally considered to be important for the education of citizens. Secondly, we are going to see the consequences and the problems created by this reform in teacher training, the basis of which (the masters) seems to be here to stay. Indeed, if the new government set up after the presidential election in May 2012 seems to intend to make some changes (particularly for the training of <b>stagiaires),</b> it is very unlikely that the BA/MA reform of teacher training will be abandoned...|$|R
40|$|Le vieillissement de la {{population}} et les changements dans les entreprises obligent de plus en plus les travailleurs, notamment les plus âgés, à suivre des formations visant à s'adapter aux transformations du travail. Deux études sur les formations à la bureautique et à la maintenance ferroviaire permettent de développer une approche multidimensionnelle de la relation âge-formation professionnelle. Les composantes cognitives et conatives de l'apprentissage des travailleurs jeunes et plus âgés sont analysées grâce à des méthodes d'investigation variées. Les croyances et représentations des <b>stagiaires</b> sur leurs capacités d'apprentissage, leur activité en situation de formation montrent les liens étroits qu'entretiennent {{la formation}} professionnelle et le travail. Ces liens sont indispensables à la compréhension de la relation âge-formation professionnelle. Catherine Delgoulet und Olivier Gonon, Die harte Prüfung des Lernens in der Mitte des Erwerbslebens : affektive und motivationale Bedingungen. Die Alterung der Gesellschaft sowie die betrieblichen Veränderungen zwingen immer mehr - insbesonders ältere - Arbeitnehmer zur Teilnahme an beruflichen Bildungs- und Ausbildungsgängen, um sich den veränderten Arbeitsbedingungen anzupassen. Anhand zweier Studien über Ausbildungsgänge im Bereich Bürotechnik und Wartung im Schienenverkehr wird in diesem Beitrag ein multidimensionaler Forschungsansatz zur Beziehung Alter/ Berufsbildung entwickelt. Mit Hilfe unterschiedlicher Untersuchungsmethoden werden die kognitiven und konativen Elemente des Lernprozesses jungerer und älterer Arbeitnehmer analysiert. Die Überzeugungen und Vorstellungen der Teilnehmer bezüglich ihrer Lernfähigkeit sowie ihrer Tätigkeit innerhalb der Ausbildungssituation machen die bestehenden Verbindungen zwischen Berufsbildung und Arbeit deutlich, die absolut notwendig für das Verständnis der Beziehung Alter/Berufsbildung sind. Catherine Delgoulet and Olivier Gonon, The trials of apprenticeship in mid-career : the affective and motivational conditions. In {{view of the}} aging of the active population and the technological and organizational changes occurring at firms, workers, especially the older ones, are being increasingly obliged to undergo vocational training courses liable to help them to cope with the changing situation at work. Based on two studies on vocational training courses in office computer techniques and railway maintenance methods, a multi-dimensional approach is taken here to the relationships between age and vocational training. The cognitive and connotive components of the apprenticeship undergone by younger and older workers are analysed using various methods of investigation. The beliefs and representations of the trainees as to their ability to learn and the efforts they make in vocational training situations show the existence of close links between vocational training and work. These links are indispensible to understanding the relationships between age and vocational training. Delgoulet Catherine, Gonon Olivier. L'épreuve de l'apprentissage en milieu de carrière.
