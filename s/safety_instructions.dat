25|$|After the accident, {{investigators}} {{recovered a}} partially burned {{copy of the}} <b>safety</b> <b>instructions</b> for loading HTP torpedoes, but the instructions were for a significantly different type of torpedo and failed to include essential steps for testing an air valve. The 7th Division, 1st Submarine Flotilla never inspected the Kursks crew's qualifications and readiness to fire HTP torpedoes. Kursks crew had no prior experience with and had not been trained in handling or firing HTP-powered torpedoes. Ryazantsev believed that due to their inexperience and lack of training, compounded by incomplete inspections and oversight, and because Kursks crew followed faulty instructions when loading the practice torpedo, they set off {{a chain of events}} that led to the explosion. Ryazantsev asserted that signatures on the records documenting that the sailors had been trained in handling and firing HTP torpedoes had been faked. He stated that the warhead fuses on combat torpedoes 1, 3, 5, and 6 were set off when the first compartment collapsed after striking the sea bottom.|$|E

40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} of {{occupational safety and}} health and of training in the construction sector, summarizing the findings of different researchers. The studies discussed emphasize <b>safety</b> <b>instruction</b> and on the job training at sites, especially the teaching of first aid skills and accident prevention. Construction workers regard occupational training as important in maintaining work ability. Present developments of vocational training with new flexible pathways are described. Rehabilitation needs are found to be a further important target of work ability promotion. The study provides support for comprehensive occupational health and safety measures. New feedback safety measures (LIIKKUVA, TR- safety audit), which are based on goal setting and a follow up in collaboration, seem to improve considerably both the safety and the development of construction work. <b>Safety</b> <b>Instruction,</b> On The Job Training, Vocational Education, Occupational Safety And Health, Construction Occupations,...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 59 - 60) The {{relationship between}} the levels of job-safety knowledge with the occurrence of on-the-job accidental injury was investigated among selected International House of Pancakes restaurant waitresses. The level of job-safety knowledge of the injured waitress was compared {{to the level of}} job-safety knowledge of the non-injured waitress. A questionnaire which dealt with safe work procedures was developed to determine the levels of job-safety knowledge of selected waitresses employed at various International House of Pancakes restaurants located throughout the Greater Los Angeles area. The study population was divided into two groups for analysis. Those waitresses who sustained an on-the-job injury were designated as the Accident Group. Those employees who did not sustain injury were referred to as the Non-Accident Group. The study population was described according to age, total waitress experience, educational levels achieved, hours employed, and whether they had received <b>safety</b> <b>instruction.</b> Statistical analysis of the results obtained from the job-safety knowledge questionnaire produced two important findings. First, {{there was no significant difference}} in the levels of job safety knowledge of selected International House of Pancakes restaurant waitresses among those employees who sustained an on-the-job injury and those employees who did not sustain an on-the-job injury. Secondly, there was a significant relationship between job-safety <b>instruction</b> and <b>safety</b> knowledge. Waitresses who had received <b>safety</b> <b>instruction</b> achieved higher scores on the study questionnaire than employees who did not receive <b>safety</b> <b>instruction...</b>|$|R
