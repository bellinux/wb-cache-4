5|$|I-475 {{was first}} opened to {{traffic in the}} early 1970s. The first <b>section</b> <b>was</b> built between I-75/US10 northward to M-21/M-78. The second <b>section</b> <b>was</b> built from I-75/US10/US23 to BUSM-54 along {{the north side of}} town. These two {{sections}} were opened on November 9, 1973 and September 26, 1974 respectively. The final <b>section</b> <b>was</b> opened between them in 1981.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1970s, Highway89 was {{extended}} east to Highway11 at Fennell. This <b>section</b> <b>was</b> eventually {{returned to the}} jurisdiction of Simcoe County on April1, 1997.|$|E
5|$|This <b>section</b> <b>was</b> fully paved {{by the end}} of 1937. On August11, 1937, the DHO {{extended}} the highway east to Highway28 at Burleigh Falls.|$|E

5000|$|The book is {{in three}} major sections. The first <b>section</b> <b>is</b> called [...] "Part 1: The Career". The second <b>section</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Part Two: The Analysis". The third <b>section</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Part Three: The Facts".|$|R
5|$|At this point, much of {{the assumed}} route was a gravel road. Only the section south of Orono was paved. The Lindsay to Norland <b>section</b> <b>was</b> paved in the 1940s, and north of that point {{beginning}} in 1954. It would take until 1958 for paving to commence south of Lindsay.|$|E
5|$|Dating back to 1919, M-89 was {{originally}} just {{a segment of}} the current highway between the Ganges area and Martin. Changes through the 1920s and 1930s moved the eastern end to Calhoun County. The last <b>section</b> <b>was</b> paved in the 1950s before the highway was rerouted in the Allegan, Michigan area. The last extensions into Battle Creek came in the 1960s and 1998.|$|E
5|$|Food in the <b>section</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} themed to the era, {{with a large}} indoor pub and rib stand. The food later took on a {{more traditional}} North American cuisine, like a buffet and subs. Private events are held in the Courtyard facility.|$|E
50|$|The spiric {{sections}} {{result from}} the intersection of a torus with a plane that {{is parallel to the}} rotational symmetry axis of the torus. Consequently, spiric <b>sections</b> <b>are</b> fourth-order (quartic) plane curves, whereas the conic <b>sections</b> <b>are</b> second-order (quadratic) plane curves. Spiric <b>sections</b> <b>are</b> a special case of a toric <b>section,</b> and <b>were</b> the first toric <b>sections</b> to <b>be</b> described.|$|R
50|$|This <b>section</b> <b>is</b> called Expo-daero(Korean: 엑스포대로). and {{downtown}} of Yeosu~Haeryong(Suncheon) <b>section</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} motorway.|$|R
5000|$|Qingdao-Taiyuan High-Speed Railway is made {{of three}} sections. Currently, one <b>section</b> <b>is</b> {{operational}} and trains are detouring via the Qingdao-Jinan Passenger Railway until the Qingdao-Jinan <b>Section</b> <b>is</b> complete, while the Shijiazhuang-Jinan <b>section</b> <b>is</b> under construction and will open in 2018.|$|R
5|$|Hillside Avenue widens out {{considerably}} between 218th Street and 229th Street in Queens Village, and gains a {{very wide}} median. This <b>section</b> <b>was</b> widened in the 1930s to accommodate construction of the proposed eastern terminus of the IND Queens Boulevard Line at Springfield Boulevard and Rocky Hill Road (Braddock Avenue).|$|E
5|$|I-270 was {{constructed}} in several phases, beginning with a section from I-70 to Vasquez Boulevard. Following this <b>section</b> <b>was</b> {{another part of the}} freeway from Vasquez Boulevard west to I-76, and finally a section from US36 to I-76. This last segment has undergone much more construction, including new bridges and ramps at interchanges.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, a new {{station in}} the Tomorrowland <b>section</b> <b>was</b> built for the DRR. Tomorrowland Station, {{consisting}} of a covered platform with no station building, was constructed in April 1958 with a futuristic theme, which was updated in 1998 {{as part of a}} redevelopment of the Tomorrowland section.|$|E

50|$|The road {{is divided}} in two {{distinct}} sections {{that do not}} meet; yet the <b>sections</b> <b>are</b> connected by the Monash Freeway and the West Gate Freeway. In the east, the <b>section</b> <b>is</b> 122 km; while the western <b>section</b> <b>is</b> 37 km in length.|$|R
5|$|In 2011, CSX Transportation, the then-owner of {{the northernmost}} section, from 30th to 34th Streets, agreed in {{principle}} to donate the section to the city, while the Related Companies, which owns the development rights to the West Side Rail Yards, agreed not {{to tear down the}} spur that crosses 10th Avenue. Construction on the final <b>section</b> <b>was</b> started in September 2012.|$|E
5|$|In the process, Highway62 was {{truncated}} {{at the new}} bypass; the removed <b>section</b> <b>was</b> redesignated Highway148, {{giving it}} the same number as the route in Quebec that it served {{to connect with the}} Trans-Canada Highway.|$|E
5|$|M-91 {{was formed}} when M-66 was rerouted in the 1940s. At the time, the highway {{continued}} south to Lowell, but subsequent transfers or roadway sections have truncated {{the route to}} its present form. For a time period in the 1980s, M-91 was even a discontinuous highway when a section in the middle was transferred to county control before the southernmost <b>section</b> <b>was</b> transferred.|$|E

5|$|No Admiralty {{camouflage}} <b>section</b> <b>was</b> established until October 1940. Admiralty camouflage schemes promulgated in 1941 {{were not}} universally adopted because of difficulties with operating schedules and shortages of some paint pigments. Nearly all destroyers and larger ships wore an Admiralty disruptive camouflage scheme by late 1942; but Commonwealth captains executed official camouflage schemes with greater variation than was customary with American measures.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November 1854 the new {{cemetery}} {{opened and}} the southern Anglican <b>section</b> <b>was</b> consecrated by Charles Sumner, Bishop of Winchester.

5|$|Ops (B) was a {{deception}} planning department {{within the}} Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) during the Second World War. Established in the United Kingdom in April 1943, the <b>section</b> <b>was</b> {{in charge of}} operational deception planning for the Western Front. Their major contribution was to Operations Cockade and Bodyguard, the latter being the cover plan for their Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Highway 33 {{continued}} northeast through Trenton to {{the town}} of Stirling, ending at a junction with Highway 14. This <b>section</b> <b>was</b> transferred to county governments by the beginning of 1998. In 2009, Highway33 west of Picton became the site of the first modern roundabout on a provincial highway.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{also called}} for retail space, housing units, and a library branch. Though the library <b>section</b> <b>was</b> built, a library branch did not open at the site.

5000|$|When two {{particles}} interact, {{their mutual}} cross <b>section</b> <b>is</b> the area transverse to their relative motion within which they must meet {{in order to}} scatter from each other. If the particles are hard spheres that interact only upon contact, their scattering cross <b>section</b> <b>is</b> related to their geometric size. If the particles interact through some action-at-a-distance force, such as electromagnetism or gravity, their scattering cross <b>section</b> <b>is</b> generally larger than their geometric size. When a cross <b>section</b> <b>is</b> specified {{as a function of}} some final-state variable, such as particle angle or energy, it is called a [...] "differential cross section". When a cross <b>section</b> <b>is</b> integrated over all scattering angles (and possibly other variables), it is called a [...] "total cross section". Cross <b>sections</b> <b>are</b> typically denoted [...] ("sigma") and measured in units of area.|$|R
5000|$|A chapter or <b>section</b> may <b>be</b> {{contained}} within a part and/or a book. When both chapters and <b>sections</b> <b>are</b> {{used in the}} same work, the <b>sections</b> <b>are</b> more often {{contained within}} chapters than the reverse.|$|R
