5|$|This was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to cause significant disruption to oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico. Several hundred active wells went out of service, and drilling {{came to a halt}} for a few days during and after the cyclone's passage. One of Humble company's tenders saw three-quarters of its mooring chains compromised, which <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> around into an adjacent oil platform, causing $200,000 in damage (1956USD). The cost to downtime in production was greater than the damage Flossy created to the oil rigs. There was no loss of life. Due to the impact of Flossy on oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico, the American Petroleum Institute formed a committee called Fundamental Research on Weather Forecasting. Their goal was to use mathematical models and historic data to better predict hurricane formation and path. Studies went on into 1962, but no reliable forecast mechanism was found.|$|E
25|$|Sussex took {{hand of a}} see-sawing {{match at}} Canterbury, mainly thanks to their Pakistani {{overseas}} players Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and Mushtaq Ahmed, who took fourteen wickets between them. The hosts Kent won the toss and put Sussex in to bat, and after an initial opening partnership of 65, two wickets fell quickly. However, an opener Ian Ward completed his century, and 63 from Murray Goodwin <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> Sussex's way to 210 for 2 before South African all-rounder Andrew Hall took two quick wickets. Sussex quickly slumped to 298 for 8, but captain Chris Adams stood firm, making 83 as Sussex batted into the second day - making 378 in the end. Curiously, Simon Cook of Kent bowled eleven maidens in 24 overs, but conceded 57 runs in the other 13.|$|E
25|$|Only 36 overs of {{play was}} {{possible}} {{on the first}} day at the St Lawrence Ground, in which Middlesex made 92 runs for the loss of one wicket, that of Ben Hutton. The following day, Kent bowler Amjad Khan added two wickets to his overnight tally of one, as Middlesex crumbled to 136 for 4 on the second morning. However, centuries from Owais Shah and Paul Weekes <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> Middlesex' way, as they declared on 400 for 8. Kent's openers did not wish to be any worse, with David Fulton making 110 and Robert Key 142, and Darren Stevens supplied with the fifth century of the match, making 106 before being bowled by Nantie Hayward. They declared on 549 for 6, leaving themselves roughly three hours in which to bowl Middlesex out for 149 or less, and four wickets from Min Patel gave them hope as Middlesex crashed to 77 for 6 with more than an hour to play. However, Peter Trego kept out 98 balls for a stolid, unbeaten 3, Paul Weekes got a fifty, and Middlesex saved the draw.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more the}} {{youngest}} Rover started {{to use the}} lariat. As <b>it</b> <b>swung</b> upward <b>it</b> missed the tree and swished out of sight {{over the edge of}} the hole.|$|R
60|$|In {{came the}} ball, and the Roxley player <b>swung</b> at <b>it</b> viciously.|$|R
60|$|The {{next was}} an incurve, but Brassy <b>swung</b> at <b>it</b> and missed again.|$|R
25|$|However, {{the quick}} scoring {{and the first}} Test result led many {{people to believe that}} Australia would come back with a vengeance {{on the second day of}} the matcht. Instead, Steve Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer, and Matthew Hayden holed out to Harmison's new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard for a golden duck – the first of Hayden's career. The {{dismissal}} was to set the tone of the innings. Although Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch – Ponting swept to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Damien Martyn was run out taking a risky single for 20. Once again, Vaughan was in the action, hitting the stumps with a throw from mid off. Langer and Michael Clarke continued after lunch in the same vein, but again, a couple of quick wickets – Clarke edging a quicker ball from Ashley Giles behind and Simon Katich falling in the same way to Andrew Flintoff <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> England's way. At 208 for 5, the Australians were struggling, but another good partnership between Langer and Gilchrist saw them to tea with no further loss.|$|E
500|$|After {{the banquet}} and the toasts, {{he left for}} the naming ceremony. It had already been decided that the christening would be {{performed}} by Clarissa (1790–1868), wife of Philip John Miles (1773–1845) and mother of Bristol's MP, Philip William Skinner Miles (1816–1881), {{a director of the}} company. She stepped forward, grasped the champagne bottle and <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> towards the bows. Unfortunately the steam packet Avon had started to tow the ship into the harbour and the bottle fell about [...] short of its target and dropped unbroken into the water. A second bottle was rapidly obtained and the Prince hurled it against the iron hull.|$|E
500|$|Republic of Loose {{have earned}} the admiration of several musicians. Damien Dempsey called them the [...] "best band in Ireland" [...] after {{performing}} alongside them. Sinéad O'Connor, {{in an e-mail}} to the Irish Independent, asked to become a member of what she described as [...] "simply the best Irish band ever". Bono has described them as [...] "sophisticated soul bootboys", [...] "trailblazers" [...] and proclaimed that [...] "the Celtic Twilight turned into Celtic soul with Van Morrison, then Republic of Loose grabbed the Celtic Tiger by the tail, <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> around their heads and threw it out the window into the cosmos". Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody, who called them [...] "the best band in the country this year [...] and for many years to come". Snow Patrol have also remixed [...] "Comeback Girl". Praise has come from other musicians too, including Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters. Marcus Russell, manager of Oasis, is reported as having called Republic of Loose the [...] "most exciting new band" [...] since Oasis. Novelist Irvine Welsh has referred to [...] "Comeback Girl" [...] as [...] "one of the greatest songs ever recorded". Actress Mischa Barton is also a fan.|$|E
60|$|The {{next one}} was a {{straight}} drive, and Sam <b>swung</b> at <b>it</b> with all the strength and skill he possessed.|$|R
60|$|Again Tom wound up, and {{the ball}} shot over the plate. This time the batsman <b>swung</b> for <b>it,</b> but failed to connect.|$|R
60|$|Again {{the ball}} came in, and this time, {{as it was}} a fairly good one, the batter <b>swung</b> for <b>it,</b> and missed.|$|R
2500|$|Archie MacLaren was {{selected}} as captain for the remaining Tests, with the Honourable Stanley Jackson being somehow overlooked for his role (at the time the [...] "Honourable" [...] should have <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> his way). Jackson, however, went on to captain England later. The second Test was won well by Australia, with notable performances from Ernie Jones (7 for 88 in England's first innings) and Clem Hill and Victor Trumper (both making 135 in Australia's first innings) helping the Aussies to a 10 wicket victory.|$|E
2500|$|Akram {{also held}} {{the record for}} the most wickets in Cricket World Cups, a total of 55 in 38 matches. Australia's Glenn McGrath broke the record during the 2007 Cricket World Cup, ending with a final tally of 71 from 39 matches. On passing Wasim's record, McGrath said, [...] "Wasim Akram, to me, is one of the {{greatest}} bowlers of all time. Left-armer, <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> both ways with the new ball and he was so dangerous with the old ball. To go past him is something I will always remember. Probably the other side of the coin is that if you play long enough, you're going to break records here and there." ...|$|E
60|$|Ricardo caught hold of {{an ancient}} Gladstone bag and <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> on the wharf with a thump.|$|E
60|$|All seemed {{perfectly}} still on this side, {{and he was}} gradually and steadily lowered down. Presently those above felt the rope slack. Another minute and <b>it</b> <b>swung</b> loosely. <b>It</b> was drawn up again, and Malcolm, placing {{one of the men}} at the loophole, with instructions to listen intently for any sound of alarm or conflict, {{turned his attention to the}} other side.|$|R
5|$|A ball {{is called}} when the pitcher throws a pitch that {{is outside the}} strike zone, {{provided}} the batter has not <b>swung</b> at <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|Randy {{was on the}} alert, and {{although}} the next ball pitched was a bit low, he <b>swung</b> for <b>it,</b> sending it down toward right field.|$|R
60|$|The two men {{carried a}} lantern, and they <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> over their heads, casting the rays {{as far as}} {{possible}} about them.|$|E
60|$|Borrowdean {{dropped his}} eyeglass, and <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> {{deliberately}} by its black ribbon. He looked steadily at Berenice, {{but his eyes}} seemed to travel past her.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{chair by}} the door. I seized it and <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> into the space between us. Then, {{springing}} back, I banged the door and ran.|$|E
60|$|The door <b>swung</b> open. <b>It</b> {{was dark}} outside, but Agravaine could {{distinguish}} a female form, and, beyond, a shapeless mass {{which he took}} correctly to be {{the remains of the}} two plug-uglies.|$|R
5000|$|Tom Wopat {{covered the}} song on his 2009 album Consider <b>It</b> <b>Swung.</b>|$|R
60|$|Her hand, as <b>it</b> <b>swung,</b> touched his. He held it. She {{opened her}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|It was glorious to see {{how easily}} she seized a heavy {{dumb-bell}} and <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> above her head. The front line of her body was majestic as she stood thus.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello! hello!" [...] he yelled, and {{catching}} up the lantern, he <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> {{out in one}} direction and another. Then he saw two forms approaching on the run, each dripping with water.|$|E
60|$|Grasping it in both hands, he <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> round his head, {{and made}} {{as though he}} would knock Oolalik down with it, causing that young Eskimo to shrink back in feigned alarm.|$|E
2500|$|All I can {{remember}} is, Bob Willis had this big inswinging, in-dipping action," [...] Darling says. [...] "The ball was pitched well outside off stump {{was the last}} thing I remember. Once <b>it</b> <b>swung</b> in, <b>it</b> also cut in further. I was caught in no man's land. I was sort of caught out of position, and hit in the chest. Unfortunately, at the time, I was chewing a chewy, and I swallowed my tongue and chewy as well. That caused me to black out.|$|R
50|$|The NVI F.K.29 {{was a small}} Dutch biplane transport, {{carrying}} two passengers who boarded after the nose, with its single engine and fuselage, had been <b>swung</b> open. <b>It</b> was intended to link small local fields to main airports.|$|R
5000|$|The comet was {{discovered}} by Gottfried Kirch on 14 November 1680, New Style, {{and became one of}} the brightest comets of the 17th century - reputedly visible even in daytime - and was noted for its spectacularly long tail. Passing 0.42 AUs from Earth on 30 November 1680, it sped around an extremely close perihelion of [...] on 18 December 1680, reaching its peak brightness on 29 December as <b>it</b> <b>swung</b> outwards. <b>It</b> was last observed on 19 March 1681. [...] the comet was about 257 AU from the Sun.|$|R
6000|$|... "So Mr. Meadow Mouse {{picked up}} the bag, which was very heavy, and <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> over his shoulder. Then he started down the Crooked Little Path. Half way down he met Striped Chipmunk.|$|E
60|$|He put {{his hand}} down to his waist and felt for the lariat. It was still there, and he brought it up and <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> over his head, to free it from the quicksand.|$|E
60|$|With {{interest}} the boys watched the old hunter prepare his firebrand and light it. Then he <b>swung</b> <b>it</b> into a lively blaze, let fly, {{and sent it}} whirling into the hollow among the rocks.|$|E
60|$|Somehow the muttering Turnbull {{found himself}} in the flying ship also, and <b>it</b> <b>swung</b> up into the sunset.|$|R
60|$|The first ball {{to come in}} was too high, and {{the second}} too low, so Fred let them go by. Then, however, came a {{straight}} ball just where he wanted <b>it,</b> and Fred <b>swung</b> at <b>it</b> with every ounce of muscle in his body.|$|R
5000|$|... "Series can swing {{either way}} really quick," [...] Diana Taurasi said, [...] "and <b>it's</b> <b>swung</b> {{in their favor}} pretty quick now." ...|$|R
