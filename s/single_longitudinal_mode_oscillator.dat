40|$|In {{the thesis}} we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} phase conjugation techniques for the correction of amplifier aberrations in a Nd:YAG oscillator/ amplifier system. The phase conjugation process examined was stimulated Brillouin scattering in methane gas. In {{the first part of}} the thesis a TEMoo, <b>single</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>mode,</b> pre-lase Q-switched <b>oscillator</b> is described, which gave a high quality output beam. We discuss the properties of Nd:YAG laser amplifiers of the type used to amplify this output, and the ensuing beam distortions. The processes of phase conjugation and stimulated Brillouin scattering are then explained. In the latter part of the thesis experimental investigations of these processes are described. These include the effects of depolarisation due to thermally induced birefringence in the laser amplifier and the extent to which the phase conjugation process can tolerate this depolarisation. The effect of the process upon the laser linewidth, and vice versa, are also discussed. When a single amplifier stage was used in a two-pass arrangement incorporating either a conventional mirror or a phase conjugate mirror, the latter gave a factor of four improvement in beam brightness over the former. This factor was increased to sixteen when the phase conjugate mirror was used in a four-pass configuration...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model {{to study the}} effect of the pump spectrum and axial mode separation on the <b>single</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>mode</b> operation of a laser with a homogeneously broadened semi-monolithic gain medium of short absorption depth. The characterizing parameter is the ratio of the pump power up to which <b>single</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>mode</b> is possible to the pump power at the lasing threshold and is denoted by r(max). A numerical study using a Gaussian-shaped pump spectrum reveals that, for a small value of the axial mode separation and for a crystal with short absorption depth at the pump wavelength, the value of r(max) reduces significantly with increase in the FWHM of the pump spectrum and thereby results in degradation of the <b>single</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>mode</b> performance of the system. However, for large value of the axial mode separation, the SLM performance was found to be nearly independent of the variations in the spectral bandwidth of the pump beam, location of its peak emission wavelength and its polarization.

40|$|Ho:YLF/LuLiF lasers have {{specific}} applications for remote sensing such as wind-speed measurement {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) concentration measurement in the atmosphere because the operating wavelength (around 2 m) {{is located in the}} eye-safe range and can be tuned to the characteristic lines of CO 2 absorption and there is strong backward scattering signal from aerosol (Mie scattering). Experimentally, a diode pumped Ho:Tm:YLF laser has been successfully used as the transmitter of coherent differential absorption lidar for the measurement of with a repetition rate of 5 Hz and pulse energy of 75 mJ [1]. For highly precise CO 2 measurements with coherent detection technique, a laser with high repetition rate is required to averaging out the speckle effect [2]. In addition, laser efficiency is critically important for the air/space borne lidar applications, because of the limited power supply. A diode pumped Ho:Tm:YLF laser is difficult to efficiently operate in high repetition rate due to the large heat loading and up-conversion. However, a Tm:fiber laser pumped Ho:YLF laser with low heat loading can be operated at high repetition rates efficiently [3]. No matter whether wind-speed or carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration measurement is the goal, a Ho:YLF/LuLiF laser as the transmitter should operate in a <b>single</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>mode.</b> Injection seeding is a valid technique for a Q-switched laser to obtain <b>single</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>mode</b> operation.
