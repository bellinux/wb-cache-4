5|$|Yousafzai {{had come}} out of her coma by 17 October 2012, was {{responding}} well to treatment, and was said to {{have a good chance of}} fully recovering without any brain damage. Later updates on 20 and 21 October stated that she was stable, but was still battling an infection. By 8 November, she was photographed <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> in bed.|$|E
5|$|As Barksdale's men pushed toward Sickles's {{headquarters}} {{near the}} Trostle barn, the general {{and his staff}} began {{to move to the}} rear, when a cannonball caught Sickles in the right leg. He was carried off in a stretcher, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> and puffing on his cigar, attempting to encourage his men. That evening his leg was amputated, and he returned to Washington, D.C. Gen. Birney assumed command of the III Corps, which was soon rendered ineffective as a fighting force.|$|E
5|$|CSF pressure, as {{measured}} by lumbar puncture, is 10–18 cmH2O (8–15 mmHg or 1.1–2 kPa) with the patient lying {{on the side and}} 20–30 cmH2O (16–24 mmHg or 2.1–3.2 kPa) with the patient <b>sitting</b> <b>up.</b> In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4–7.3mmHg or 0.78–0.98kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the intracranial pressure.|$|E

5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} appendicitis. Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E
5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> when she received both injuries.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} from SmackDown was the event's final match, in which Batista defended the World Heavyweight Championship against The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match. At one point, Batista {{performed}} a Batista Bomb through a table on Undertaker for a near-fall. The Undertaker then performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Batista for a near-fall. The Undertaker then performed another Tombstone Piledriver {{on top of}} the steel steps and pinned Batista, but as the referee counted the pin, Edge, dressed as a cameraman, pulled the referee out of the ring, and hit The Undertaker with the camera he was holding and then positioned Undertaker's head {{on top of the}} steel steps. Edge then slammed a folding chair onto The Undertaker's head. While the referee re-entered the ring, Edge dragged Batista onto The Undertaker, and as a result, Batista pinned The Undertaker to retain the World Heavyweight Title. After the match, Edge came back into the ring and hit The Undertaker with a chair as he was <b>sitting</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

25|$|Early {{ambulation}} also prevents venous stasis {{and physicians}} order OOB {{activities on the}} same day of surgery. This is accomplished in increments. The progression of increasing mobility proceeds by: raising the head of the bed, <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> in bed, moving {{to the edge of the}} bed, dangling the legs off the bed and then ambulating to a close chair.|$|E

25|$|A shear is a {{separation}} of the skin from underlying tissues. When a patient is partially <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> in bed, their skin may stick to the sheet, making them susceptible to shearing in case underlying tissues move downward with the body toward {{the foot of the}} bed. This may also be possible on a patient who slides down while sitting in a chair.|$|E
25|$|The periods {{before and}} {{surrounding}} birth are typically normal in individuals with LNS. The most common presenting features are abnormally decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) and developmental delay, which are evident by {{three to six}} months of age. Affected individuals are late in <b>sitting</b> <b>up,</b> while most never crawl or walk. Lack of speech is also a very common trait associated with LNS.|$|E
25|$|Even with Sourith's {{refusal to}} fight against it, the coup began to unravel. Royalist troops {{promptly}} recaptured the airfield. A Royalist soldier manning a truck-mounted machine gun managed to hit Thao Ma's aircraft. He crash-landed his smoking plane on Wattay's overrun area. An Air America crash truck crew fished him from the wreckage. He was capable of <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> on his stretcher and thanking his rescuers.|$|E

25|$|Going {{across a}} moral ethics line, {{automobile}} companies {{have used a}} human cadaver, a pig, and people have volunteered to be tested upon impact. A pig was used specifically for steering wheel impact because they have an internal structure similar to humans, and can be easily placed correctly via <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> right in the vehicle. Human cadavers along with animals are not personally able to give consent to research studies, although animal testing is not prevalent today.|$|E

He continued teaching with great vigor until about 9 pm on Saturday night November 16. Then on Sunday morning of the 17th, at about 4:15a.m., Brazilian daylight time, he suffered massive heart failure while <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> in bed.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} the tent. And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> in the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.|$|E

25|$|Cassidy and I {{worked on}} Dillinger and Van Meter {{simultaneously}} on June 3. While {{the work was}} being done, Dillinger and Van Meter changed off. The work {{that could be done}} while the patient was <b>sitting</b> <b>up,</b> that patient was in the sitting-room. The work that had to be done while the man was lying down, that patient was {{on the couch in the}} bedroom. They were changed back and forth according to the work to be done. The hands were sterilized, made aseptic with antiseptics, thoroughly washed with soap and water and used sterile gauze afterwards to keep them clean. Next, cutting instrument, knife was used to expose the lower skin...in other words, take off the epidermis and expose the derma, then alternately the acid and the alkaloid was applied as was necessary to produce the desired results.|$|E
25|$|The {{severity}} of symptoms of idic(15) vary greatly between individuals. Individuals with idic(15) usually have delays in language development and motor {{skills such as}} walking or <b>sitting</b> <b>up.</b> Other traits may include low muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures (>50%), short stature, and intellectual disability. Distinctive facial features associated with idic(15), where present, are usually very subtle but may include epicanthal folds (skin folds at the inner corners of one or both eyes), broad forehead, a flattened nasal bridge, button nose, and a high arched palate (roof of the mouth). Many individuals with idic(15) display features of autism, such as problems with communication and social interactions, obsessional interests (often with interactive mechanisms like wheels, doors or switches), unpredictable sleep cycles (and a reduced need for sleep), and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (e.g., lining up toys, playing with a toy {{in the same manner}} over and over again, hand flapping, rocking back and forth). A high pain threshold is often observed. If speech develops, it is often echolalic but some individuals do grasp some language. With a severely affected person there may be an inability to walk or talk.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The UP 4 FUN {{intervention}} is a family-involved school-based intervention aiming at reducing and breaking <b>up</b> <b>sitting</b> {{time at home}} (with special emphasis on screen time), and breaking <b>up</b> <b>sitting</b> time in school among 10 - 12 year olds in Europe. The {{purpose of the present}} paper was to evaluate its short term effects. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 3147 pupils from Belgium, Germany, Greece, Hungary and Norway participated in a school-randomized controlled trial. The intervention included 1 - 2 school lessons per week for a period of six weeks, along with assignments for the children and their parents. Screen time and breaking <b>up</b> <b>sitting</b> time were registered by self-report and total sedentary time and breaking <b>up</b> <b>sitting</b> time by accelerometry. The effect of the intervention on these behaviors was evaluated by multilevel regression analyses. All analyses were adjusted for baseline values and gender. Significance level was p≤ 0. 01. No significant intervention effects were observed, neither for self-reported TV/DVD or computer/game console time, nor for accelerometer-assessed total sedentary time and number of breaks in sitting time. The intervention group, however, reported more positive attitudes towards (β = 0. 25 (95 % CI 0. 11, 0. 38)) and preferences/liking for (β = 0. 20 (95 % CI 0. 08, 0. 32)) breaking <b>up</b> <b>sitting</b> time than the control group. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: No significant intervention effect on self-reported screen time or accelerometer-assessed sedentary time or breaks in sitting time was observed, but positive effects on beliefs regarding breaking <b>up</b> <b>sitting</b> time were found in favor of the intervention group. Overall, these results do not warrant wider dissemination of the present UP 4 FUN intervention...|$|R
