50|$|Convention {{dictated}} that Federal Senate casual vacancies were filled by persons nominated {{by the same}} political party of the same state. However, on 27 February the New South Wales Liberal Party Premier, Tom Lewis, defied this convention by appointing Bunton, who was not affiliated with any party. Facing a hostile Labor Party (and sometimes hostile electorate), Bunton surprised many observers by acting independently {{rather than as a}} Liberal appointee, and resisted urgings from the Malcolm Fraser-led Opposition to block the <b>supply</b> <b>bills</b> of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's government, instead supporting Labor on the <b>supply</b> <b>bills</b> during the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis.|$|R

5|$|On March31 {{the insurgents}} kept their {{part of the}} {{agreement}} by allowing the <b>supply</b> <b>bill</b> to be passed on second reading and the budget to be hoisted for ninety days. However, when the cabinet introduced its promised bill, the insurgents claimed {{that it was not}} as agreed and refused to support it. Instead, they demanded Aberhart's resignation and announced that they were prepared to take over the government within 24hours. A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March31; according to them, he agreed to resign if they allowed the <b>supply</b> <b>bill</b> to pass a third reading. They did so, but Aberhart denied that he had agreed to resign and refused to do so unless he was defeated in a general election. The insurgents, leery of Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of his weekly radio show, wanted to avoid an election. Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise their pay for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.|$|E

5000|$|Loss {{of supply}} occurs where a {{government}} in a parliamentary democracy using the Westminster System or a system derived from it is denied a supply of treasury or exchequer funds, by whichever house or houses of parliament or head of state is constitutionally entitled to grant and deny supply. A defeat on a budgetary vote is one such way by which supply can be denied. Loss of supply is typically interpreted as indicating a loss {{of confidence in the}} government. Not all [...] "money bills" [...] are necessarily <b>supply</b> <b>bills.</b> For instance, in Australia, <b>supply</b> <b>bills</b> are defined as [...] "bills which are required by the Government to carry on its day-to-day business".|$|R
50|$|Hall won {{a federal}} Senate seat for the Liberal Movement at the double {{dissolution}} 1974 election, after resigning his state seat, which sparked a Goyder by-election.

5|$|The {{province}} has a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, {{in which}} the Premier {{is the leader of}} the party that controls the most seats in the House of Assembly. The Premier is Newfoundland and Labrador's head of government, and the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Newfoundland and Labrador, and presides over that body. Members are first elected to the House during general elections. General elections must be conducted every four years from the date of the last election. An election may also take place if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature by the defeat of a <b>supply</b> <b>bill</b> or tabling of a confidence motion.|$|E

500|$|The second {{consecutive}} double dissolution 1975 federal election in December was held {{owing to the}} dismissal of the Whitlam Government by Governor General John Kerr, and the subsequent appointment of federal Liberal leader Malcolm Fraser as Prime Minister. Prior to the dismissal, the Liberal Party had used its majority in the Australian Senate to block <b>supply</b> <b>bills.</b> Hall voted in favour of the <b>supply</b> <b>bills</b> being passed, and objected to the federal Liberals' actions. Hall had been praised for his stance on supply, but the Liberals attacked him, accusing him of being [...] "Labor in a purple disguise" [...] and saying that Fraser needed a compliant senate [...] "not hampered by independents sitting on the fence". Hall countered by saying he was preferencing the Liberals and therefore not Labor-aligned, {{and that he was}} a [...] "dedicated anti-socialist".|$|R
50|$|Both Appropriation and Imprest <b>Supply</b> <b>bills</b> {{fall under}} the rubric of {{confidence}} and supply. A refusal by the House to pass such a Bill conventionally leads to either the resignation of the Government (unlikely, since there is usually no alternative Government immediately available) or to a dissolution of the House and a subsequent general election.|$|R
25|$|Under the Australian Constitution, the House of Representatives and the Senate {{generally}} have equal legislative powers (the only exception being that appropriation (<b>supply)</b> <b>bills</b> must {{originate in the}} House of Representatives). This means that a government formed in the House of Representatives can be frustrated if a Senate majority rejects or delays passage of its legislative bills.|$|R
25|$|The President may {{withhold}} assent to any <b>Supply</b> <b>Bill,</b> Supplementary <b>Supply</b> <b>Bill</b> or Final <b>Supply</b> <b>Bill</b> for {{any financial}} year if {{in his opinion}} the estimates of revenue and expenditure, supplementary estimates or statement of excess are {{likely to lead to}} a drawing on past reserves. However, if his decision to do so is contrary to the CPA's recommendation, the refusal to concur may be overridden by a Parliamentary resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of all the elected Members of Parliament (MPs).|$|E
25|$|NMPs {{can vote}} in Parliament on any bill or motion, except {{a bill to}} amend the Constitution; a <b>supply</b> <b>bill,</b> {{supplementary}} <b>supply</b> <b>bill</b> or final supply bill; a money bill; a vote of no confidence in the Government; and removing the President from office. However, NMPs can still voice their opinions and join debates on the bills and motions they cannot vote on.|$|E
25|$|If the Government {{wishes to}} spend public money in {{addition}} to what was provided for in the budget, it must submit supplementary estimates to Parliament for approval. If the financial year has not yet ended, such supplementary estimates are passed {{in the form of}} a Supplementary Supply Act. As soon as possible after the end of each financial year, the Minister for Finance must introduce into Parliament a Final <b>Supply</b> <b>Bill</b> containing any sums which have not yet been included in any <b>Supply</b> <b>Bill.</b> This is enacted by Parliament as a Final Supply Act.|$|E
50|$|The {{president}} {{is the head of}} state of Singapore. Following the Westminster system, the position is largely ceremonial, but enjoys several reserve powers including withholding presidential assent on <b>supply</b> <b>bills</b> and changing or revoking civil service appointments.

5000|$|The {{government}} reserves {{the right}} to submit [...] "supplementary supply bills", which add additional funding above and beyond what was originally appropriated {{at the beginning of}} the fiscal year.

25|$|In 1991 the Constitution of Singapore was {{amended to}} {{transform}} the office of President, which was previously indirectly elected by Parliament, into an office directly elected by the people. The amendment conferred on the President certain executive functions to block attempts {{by the government of}} the day to draw down past reserves that it did not accumulate. Thus, a guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the Government if the President concurs, and his approval is also needed for budgets of specified statutory boards and Government companies that draw on their past reserves. The President also possesses personal discretion to withhold assent to any bill in Parliament providing directly or indirectly for the direct or indirect variation, changing or increase in powers of the Central Provident Fund Board to invest moneys belonging to it; and the borrowing of money, the giving of any guarantee or the raising of any loan by the Government if in the President's opinion the bill is likely to draw on reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office. In addition, the President may withhold assent to any <b>Supply</b> <b>Bill,</b> Supplementary <b>Supply</b> <b>Bill</b> or Final <b>Supply</b> <b>Bill</b> for any financial year if in his opinion the estimates of revenue and expenditure, supplementary estimates or statement of excess are likely to lead to a drawing on past reserves.|$|E
25|$|When Parliament resumes sitting, {{two days}} are allotted for {{a debate on}} the Budget Statement, after which Parliament votes on a motion to approve the Government's {{financial}} policy {{as set out in}} the Statement. Parliament then constitutes itself as the Committee of Supply and debates the estimates of expenditure. During the debates, MPs are entitled to question Ministers on their ministries' policies after giving notice of their intention to move amendments to reduce by token sums of S$100 the total amounts provisionally allocated to particular heads of expenditure. The Committee of Supply debates usually last between seven and ten days, and upon their conclusion a <b>Supply</b> <b>Bill</b> is passed. The enacted law is called a Supply Act.|$|E
50|$|Charges for MWA {{water for}} {{residential}} users range from 8.50-14.45 baht per m3 depending on usage. These rates have evidently been unchanged since December 1999. MWA does not add waste water charges to water <b>supply</b> <b>bills,</b> despite clear evidence from international experience {{that this is}} best practice. Critics claim this exacerbates Thailand's water pollution problems for want of adequate funding.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on the area, the {{consumer}} may have two electricity meters, one for normal supply ("Anytime") {{and one for}} the load-managed supply ("Controlled"), with Controlled <b>supply</b> <b>billed</b> at a lower rate per kilowatt-hour than Anytime supply. For those with load-managed supply but only a single meter, electricity is billed at the [...] "Composite" [...] rate, priced between Anytime and Controlled.|$|R
50|$|The Octennial Act reinvigorated the Commons, {{both with}} newly elected reformers and with MPs made more active by the {{prospect}} of imminent re-election. Changes included more assertiveness over <b>supply</b> <b>bills</b> and Poynings' Law, easing the penal laws, and securing the Constitution of 1782. There were unsuccessful attempts to shorten the maximum duration, in 1773 by Sir William Parsons and in 1777 by Sir Edward Newenham.|$|R
25|$|Charles Merz, of the Merz & McLellan {{consulting}} partnership, {{built the}} Neptune Bank Power Station near Newcastle upon Tyne in 1901, and by 1912 had developed into the largest integrated power system in Europe. In 1905 {{he tried to}} influence Parliament to unify the variety of voltages and frequencies in the country's electricity supply industry, {{but it was not}} until World War I that Parliament began to take this idea seriously, appointing him head of a Parliamentary Committee to address the problem. In 1916 Merz pointed out that the UK could use its small size to its advantage, by creating a dense distribution grid to feed its industries efficiently. His findings led to the Williamson Report of 1918, which in turn created the Electricity <b>Supply</b> <b>Bill</b> of 1919. The bill was the first step towards an integrated electricity system in the UK.|$|E
