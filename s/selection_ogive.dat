40|$|Assessment Review Committee (SARC) {{concluded}} that there were too few Fishery Observer sampled trips in which winter flounder were caught to adequately characterize the overall ratio of discards to landings in the commercial fishery. The Fishery Observer sample length frequency data, however, were judged adequate to help characterize the proportion discarded at length. In the SARC 21 assessment, commercial discards for 1985 to 1993 were estimated from length frequency data from NEFSC and the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries (MADMF) bottom trawl surveys, commercial port sampling of landings at length and Fishery Observer sampling of landings and discard at length. The method follows an approach described by Mayo et al. (1992). The year was divided into half year periods. Survey length frequency data (MADMF survey in spring and NEFSC in fall) were smoothed using a three point moving average, then filtered through a mesh <b>selection</b> <b>ogive</b> (Simpson 1989) for 4. 5 in mesh (1984 - 1989), 5 in mesh (1990 - 1992, fall 1993) or 5. 5 in mesh (spring, 1993). The 5. 5 in mesh selection curve was calculated using the 5 in curve adjusted to an L 50 for 5. 5 in mesh. The choice of mesh sizes was based on sizes used in the yellowtail assessment for southern New England (Rago et al. 1994) and comparison to length frequencies of commercial landings.

40|$|A method, {{described}} by Gulland (1961), for estimating {{the effects on}} fisheries of changes in gear selectivity is reviewed and applied to data of the major commercial fisheries of the Newfoundland Area (ICNAF Subarea 3). Methods of estimating the essential parameters are also briefly- described. The changes in gear considered are in reality increases in the mesh size of trawls, the other gear components remaining unchanged. [...] For assessment purposes the subarea has been divided into several regions, largely {{on the basis of}} a knowledge of the cod stocks, and the fisheries in them have been considered separately. Some evaluation of the effects of fishing on the cod and haddock stocks has been made, and for these fisheries both immediate and long-term assessments of increases in the mesh size of trawls have been computed. Also given are the effects of such mesh size changes on the landings by gears other than trawls. Because of the recent development of the redfish fisheries in most regions and of the scarcity of adequate data from the major redfish-producing countries, the assessments that can be made are restricted largely to the calculation of the immediate losses. [...] The assessments indicate that the mesh sizes required to produce the optimum long-term yields vary greatly between regions for the different species. Since two or more species are often present on the same fishing grounds and caught by trawlers, for practical reasons a uniform mesh-size regulation must be considered for the subarea as a whole. A 41 / 2 inch mesh size in trawls is shown to be the optimum for the cod and haddock fisheries considered together. Despite the lack of long-term assessments for the redfish fisheries, the available information suggests that long- term benefits are unlikely from any increase in mesh size, although an increase to 4 inches would result in only slight immediate losses for most regions. No long-term assessments were made for the flounder fishery, but cursory examination of <b>selection</b> <b>ogives</b> and length composition data indicates that an increase in mesh size to 6 inches would not affect the commercial landings. Since it is not practical to have different mesh, sizes throughout the subarea, it is concluded that a minimum mesh size of 41 / 2 inches might be a fair choice for the regulation of the trawl fisheries on all species...|$|R
