40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} usage of thin and {{high strength steel}} roof battens in the roof structures of low-rise buildings, recent cyclones and storms have shown that they prematurely fail at their <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> connections to the rafters or trusses due to the screw heads pulling through the batten bottom flanges. Such pull-through failures can lead to catastrophic failures of the entire roofing systems as observed during recent high wind events. Therefore a detailed experimental study consisting of both small scale and full scale tests was undertaken to investigate the pull-through failures of roof battens under wind uplift loading in relation to many critical parameters such as <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> tightening, roof batten geometry, batten thickness, steel grade, <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> head size and <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> location.

40|$|In recent times, the roofing systems made of {{thin and}} high {{strength}} steel roof sheeting and battens or purlins are predominantly used {{in the construction of}} low-rise buildings. However, such thin steel roofing systems continue to fail frequently at their <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> connections during high wind events such as storms and cyclones due to inadequate connection capacities. Localised pull-out failures occurring at the thin steel roof sheeting to batten or purlin connections have been the root cause for extensive loss of roofing systems under high wind uplift loads over many years. Such premature connection failures often cause partial or even complete loss of steel roofing systems and, thus allowing rainwater to cause severe damage to building contents. Therefore a detailed experimental study was conducted to investigate the pull-out failures occurring at the steel roof sheeting to batten or purlin connections. One hundred and eighty-seven small scale pull-out tests were conducted for this purpose using a range of <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> sizes and many thicknesses of thin steel roof battens and purlins. This paper presents the details of this experimental study and the pull-out capacity data obtained from the tests.

5000|$|Trade-off: {{solid wood}} versus {{particle}} board. Solid wood and plywood are durable and strong, but are more costly and offer less dimensional stability at manufacture than particle board. For cabinets and surface finishes that may sustain damage during long use, serviceability is a consideration.

If water reaches the core, particleboard especially will swell irreversibly (therefore it is never used in home sheathing applications, where oriented strand board OSB is used instead). Tolerances for the use of <b>screw</b> <b>fasteners</b> in particleboard are tighter than for solid wood or plywood, and screws often loosen over time if over-torqued. However, MDF and particle board are good choices where cabinets are well-constructed, will be cared-for, where service life is projected as intermediate, e.g., where the kitchen will be remodeled approximately every 15 years, or where the manufacturer can be relied upon to supply replacement components if needed.|$|E

Such roofing system damage was observed in recent cyclones due to premature failures of steel roof batten to rafter/truss connections.

Hence a series of small scale and full scale tests of roof battens was first conducted to study their pull-through failures. To further enhance the understanding gained from the experimental study and to predict the pull-through capacities {{of a wide range of}} roof battens, finite element models were developed and analysed using a suitable failure criterion. This paper first presents the applicability of the failure criterion for different roof batten geometries and <b>screw</b> <b>fastener</b> head sizes.

Past {{research}} on wind damage has shown that low cycle fatigue cracking of steel roof sheeting around the fastener holes has been {{the reason for the}} premature pull-through failures of roof claddings under fluctuating wind forces. Such a situation will be at its worst if the roof sheeting is already split at the fastener holes. An inspection of trapezoidal steel roofs has shown that roofing has been split in the transverse direction due to accidental or poor workmanship-caused overtightening of <b>screw</b> <b>fasteners.</b> Once split, even slightly, the roofing can only survive a few cycles of wind uplift loading.

40|$|Thin {{profiled}} steel {{roof sheeting}} and battens are increasingly {{used in the}} construction of roofing systems in buildings in Australia. Past wind damage investigations have shown that roof sheeting failures occurred frequently due to localized failures at their screw connections to battens.

Therefore a detailed investigation including both experimental and numerical studies was undertaken to investigate the pull-through failures of roof battens at their connections to rafter/truss. More than 300 small scale tests of battens and two full scale tests of roofing systems were undertaken to investigate the localized pull-through failure while finite element analyses (FEA) of tested battens were also undertaken.

40|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>fasteners</b> are {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} most important machine elements due to their outstanding characteristic to provide a high clamping force just with a simplified design. However, the loosen vibration is their inherent and inevitable fault. The friction locking approach is one of the basic locking fastener categories by enhancing the bearing load on the contact surface of thread by applying a locking force on an antiloosening nut. This locking force may cause more severe deformation in the nut. The contact stress distribution on the nut would be changed and that can cause the variation of the friction torque for the bolt joint. However, there exists no established design calculation procedure that accounts for the rotation deformation and its stiffness of the antiloosening nut under the locking force. The main objective of the work is to develop an analytical solution to the rotation deformation problem encountered in the antiloosening nut. The proposed model is supported by comparison with numerical finite element analysis of different sizes of joint elements and different applied forces...|$|E
