40|$|The {{correlation}} between meteorological data {{collected at the}} optical wide-field patrol network (OWL-Net) Station No. 1 and <b>the</b> <b>seeing</b> of satellite optical observation data was analyzed. Meteorological data and satellite optical observation data from June 2014 to November 2015 were analyzed. The analyzed meteorological data were the outdoor air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and cloud index data, and the analyzed satellite optical observation data were <b>the</b> <b>seeing</b> full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) data. The annual meteorological pattern for Mongolia was analyzed by collecting meteorological data over four seasons, with data collection beginning after the installation and initial set-up of the OWL-Net Station No. 1 in Mongolia. A comparison of the meteorological data and <b>the</b> <b>seeing</b> of <b>the</b> satellite optical observation data showed that <b>the</b> <b>seeing</b> degrades as <b>the</b> wind strength increases and as the cloud cover decreases. This finding is explained by the bias effect, which {{is caused by the}} fact that the number of images taken on the less cloudy days was relatively small. <b>The</b> <b>seeing</b> FWHM showed no clear correlation with either temperature or relative humidity...|$|R

5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> {{outcome of the}} battle hung in the balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of}} the allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E

Although Brother Justin shares traits with Father Coughlin, an Irish Catholic priest who broadcast his sermons over the radio in the 1930s, the writers never tried to retell that particular story.|$|E
