5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be used to determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe <b>specific</b> <b>action,</b> but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing as}} Jodie, the game {{includes}} interactive objects {{marked with a}} white dot, which can be interacted with by tilting the controller stick in its direction. If Jodie must perform a <b>specific</b> <b>action,</b> icons pop {{up on the screen}} to prompt the player to press and/or hold certain controller buttons. Conversation prompts float in the air, defaulting to a certain choice if too much time passes before selection. During action sequences, like chases or hand-to-hand combat, the cinematography moves into slow motion whilst Jodie performs the physical manoeuvre; during this time, the player must determine the direction Jodie is moving and push the controller stick in that direction to complete the action. Other sequences require real-time stealth, which has the player sneak Jodie through environments while coordinating certain actions with Aiden. Failing certain action sequences will alter the course of a chapter (and sometimes later chapters) and in some cases lead to the death of a non-playable character.|$|E
5000|$|In {{this book}} Merchant {{describes}} three forms of control: control of <b>specific</b> <b>actions,</b> control of results {{and control of}} personnel. When knowledge of which <b>specific</b> <b>actions</b> are desirable is excellent, {{it is always a}} good thing to control <b>specific</b> <b>actions.</b> When the ability to measure results on important performance dimensions is high, it is always a good thing to control results. When {{it is difficult to know}} which <b>specific</b> <b>actions</b> are desirable and when it is difficult as well to measure the results, the optimal control is the personnel control.|$|R

5|$|McCann was {{the first}} member of the 10th Battalion to be awarded the Military Cross, and was also the first unit officer to receive an award in the field for any <b>specific</b> <b>action.</b> The wound to his head had {{severely}} fractured his skull, but he remained at his post until he had reported the situation to the commanding officer of the 9th Battalion. He was evacuated to hospital in England, and his award of the Military Cross was reported in the Adelaide Advertiser newspaper on 29 September along with a photograph and brief details of his service. After he had recovered sufficiently, he attended an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 4 October where he received his Military Cross from King George V. On the same day, a fellow 10th Battalion officer, Arthur Blackburn, received his Victoria Cross for his own actions at Pozières that closely followed those of McCann. McCann was medically classified to be returned to Australia on a hospital ship, but avoided these orders and returned to his battalion in France in November. On his return, he was placed in command of B Company. In February 1917 he was evacuated suffering from illness, and after recovering was sent to a training school for a month. He rejoined the battalion in March.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{marked as}} {{allies of the}} Turks in the Peloponnese, Jewish {{settlements}} were also massacred by Greek revolutionaries; Steve Bowman argues that the tragedy {{may have been more}} a side-effect of the butchering of the Turks of Tripolis, the last Ottoman stronghold in the South, where the Jews had taken refuge from the fighting, than a <b>specific</b> <b>action</b> against Jews as such. Many Jews around Greece and throughout Europe were supporters of the Greek revolt, using their resources to loan substantial amounts to the newly formed Greek government. In turn, the success of the Greek Revolution was to stimulate the incipient stirrings of Jewish nationalism, later called Zionism.|$|E
25|$|Noted American {{folk music}} {{archivist}} and collector Alan Lomax first {{attracted the attention}} of the Security Service when it was noted that he had made contact with the Romanian press attaché in London while he was working on a series of folk music broadcasts for the BBC in 1952. Correspondence ensued with the American authorities as to Lomax' suspected membership of the Communist Party, though no positive proof is found on this file. The Service took the view that Lomax' work compiling his collections of world folk music gave him a legitimate reason to contact the attaché, and that while his views (as demonstrated by his choice of songs and singers) were undoubtedly left wing, {{there was no need for}} any <b>specific</b> <b>action</b> against him.|$|E

25|$|The general {{process for}} a typical {{courtship}} interaction begins when a male flies and lands near a perching female, who is most likely perched on a host plant, such as several species of the Passiflora genus. Once the male has landed, the male assumes a position next to the female with their heads together and with their bodies aligned at a 45-degree angle. At this time, the male engages in a <b>specific</b> <b>action</b> called the wing clap display in which the male continuously claps its wings open and closed. During this time, the antennae of the female are placed between the opening and closing wings. After the male ceases wing movement, the male butterfly will move into a position that facilitates genital contact with the female. The average duration of the copulation process including the wing clap display is approximately 11 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Each service {{attaches}} campaign/battle streamers, sometimes {{known as}} battle honours, for actions {{in which the}} service {{as a whole has}} taken part. These can either be war service streamers, which are in the colours of the appropriate campaign medal and have the name of the campaign embroidered; or unit citation streamers, which have the name of the action embroidered and signify that the unit's performance in a <b>specific</b> <b>action</b> has been worthy of special mention. Units are also permitted to wear streamers of overseas awards they may have been presented with. These streamers are in the colours of the appropriate medal ribbon. The streamers are 3ft × 2.75in. The Army, for instance, currently has 178 service streamers, embroidering the name of each battle on each, as does the Air Force. The Marine Corps and Navy instead embroider award devices onto streamers to consolidate them, having 62 and 34, respectively.|$|E

It is recommended that requests use clear, positive, concrete action language.|$|E

500|$|<b>Specific</b> <b>action</b> cues {{were scored}} {{on the piano}} down to each second of film. Noting how the film was set in the Caribbean and had a different, slower pace than Speed, Mancina gave the score a [...] "Jamaican/Latin feel" [...] by {{incorporating}} reggae music between action sequences. The reggae music was written to give the feel of being on vacation {{and serve as a}} love theme for the characters. Some themes from Speed were included in the score between sections of the newly written material. He wrote new themes for Annie and Alex because he felt the original themes written for Reeves' character would not work well with Patric. After viewing the scene where Geiger attaches leeches to his body to cleanse his blood, Mancina felt the scene was [...] "so gross" [...] that he wrote a [...] "slimy theme" [...] for the character, which is distinctively {{different from the rest of}} the music. He mixed the score at the same time the film was being edited, which meant the music had to be constantly re-edited into the film. During the scoring of Speed2, Mancina said in an interview that keeping up with the editing of the film was the [...] "hardest thing [...] ever done".|$|E
