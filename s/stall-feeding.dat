My spirits certainly, and my health I fancied, were beginning to sink under the noise, dirt, and unwholesome air of our Hamburg hotel. I left it on Sunday, Sept. 23rd. with a letter of introduction from the poet Klopstock, to the Amtmann of Ratzeburg. The Amtmann received me with kindness, and introduced me to the worthy pastor, who agreed to board and lodge me {{for any length of}} time not less than a month. The vehicle, in which I took my place, was considerably larger than an English stage-coach, to which it bore much the same proportion and rude resemblance, that an elephant's ear does to the human. Its top was composed of naked boards of different colours, and seeming to have been parts of different wainscots. Instead of windows there were leathern curtains with a little eye of glass in each: they perfectly answered the purpose of keeping out the prospect and letting in the cold. I could observe little, therefore, but the inns and farm-houses at which we stopped. They were all alike, except in size: one great room, like a barn, with a hay-loft over it, the straw and hay dangling in tufts through the boards which formed the ceiling of the room, and the floor of the loft. From this room, which is paved like a street, sometimes one, sometimes two smaller ones, are enclosed at one end. These are commonly floored. In the large room the cattle, pigs, poultry, men, women, and children, live in amicable community: yet there was an appearance of cleanliness and rustic comfort. One of these houses I measured. It was an hundred feet in length. The apartments were taken off from one corner. Between these and the stalls there was a small interspace, and here the breadth was forty-eight feet, but thirty-two where the stalls were; of course, the stalls were on each side eight feet in depth. The faces of the cows &c. were turned towards the room; indeed they were in it, so that they had at least the comfort of seeing each other's faces. <b>Stall-feeding</b> is universal in this part of Germany, a practice concerning which the agriculturist and the poet are likely to entertain opposite opinions--or at least, to have very different feelings. The wood-work of these buildings on the outside is left unplastered, as in old houses among us, and, being painted red and green, it cuts and tesselates the buildings very gaily. From within three miles of Hamburg almost to Molln, which is thirty miles from it, the country, as far as I could see it was a dead flat, only varied by woods. At Molln it became more beautiful. I observed a small lake nearly surrounded with groves, and a palace in view belonging to the King of Great Britain, and inhabited by the Inspector of the Forests. We were nearly the same time in travelling the thirty-five miles from Hamburg to Ratzeburg, as we had been in going from London to Yarmouth, one hundred and twenty-six miles.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{numerous}} government reports, China’s grasslands {{are suffering from}} serious overgrazing, leading to degradation and desertification.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study {{was carried out}} from July to September 1989 in Kaloleni Division, Coast Province, Kenya to estimate the prevalence of vector-transmitted diseases in small-holder dairy cattle and to identify the risk factors associated with different management systems. One hundred and thirty of the 157 herds with dairy cattle in Kaloleni Division were surveyed. These were from three agro-ecological zones (coconutÂ¯cassava, cashewnutÂ¯cassava and livestockÂ¯millet), comprised two management systems (<b>stall-feeding</b> and herded grazing) and were herds with either dairy cattle only or with Zebu and dairy cattle. A formal questionnaire sought answers to questions on cattle health and management practices. A total of 734 dairy and 205 Zebu cattle in 78 dairy and 52 mixed (dairy and Zebu) herds were sampled and screened for haemoparasites (Trypanosoma, Anaplasma, Babesia, and Theileria infections). Sera were tested for antibodies to Theileria parva, using the schizonts-antigen indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) test and to antibodies for Babesia bigemina and antigens to Anaplasma marginale by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Packed-cell volume (PCV) also was measured. Tick-control measures were practised by all except three of the farmers. Despite this, overall seroprevalence to T. parva was > 70 % suggesting either that control practices were not strictly implemented or they were ineffective. The seroprevalence of T. parva in adult cattle kept in <b>stall-feeding</b> systems in the coconutÂ¯cassava zone was significantly lower (57 Â± 8 % (S. E.)) than in herded-grazing systems (79 Â± 3 %) {{and there was no}} association between antibody prevalence and age of cattle in this zone. Antibody prevalences in cattle in the cashewnutÂ¯cassava and the drier livestockÂ¯millet zone increased with age. Cattle in herded-grazing systems had an overall lower seroprevalence of T. parva infection in the livestockÂ¯millet zone (45 Â± 6 %) than in the other two zones. Analysis was confined to the coconutÂ¯cassava zone for B. bigemina and to the coconutÂ¯cassava and cashewnutÂ¯cassava zones for A. marginale. Mean prevalences of B. bigemina were 40. 9 Â± 9 and 73 Â± 6 % for dairy cattle under <b>stall-feeding</b> and herded-grazing systems, respectively, and increased with age. Antigen prevalences of A. marginale were over 80 % in all age groups of cattle in the coconutÂ¯cassava and cashewnutÂ¯cassava zones. Overall trypanosome prevalence in cattle was < 1 %.

40|$|This {{research}} describes {{and analyses}} how smallholder crop livestock farmers in rural Ea Kar, Vietnam, {{were able to}} take advantage of the rising demand for meat in urban centres and transform cattle production from a traditional, extensive grazing system to a more intensive, stall-fed system that supplied quality meat to urban markets. The traditional grazing system produced low-quality animals that could only be sold for local consumption. Introduction of the concept of farm-grown fodder production enabled farmers to produce fatter animals, achieving higher sale prices, and reduce labour inputs by moving from grazing to <b>stall-feeding.</b> These benefits convinced farmers, traders and local government that smallholder cattle production could be a viable enterprise and so stimulated stakeholder interest. Within 10 years, the way that cattle were produced and marketed changed considerably. By 2010, more than 3, 000 smallholders had adopted farm-grown forages and <b>stall-feeding,</b> and many produced high-quality beef cattle. Traders had been able to develop access to urban markets as farmers were able to produce animals that satisfied the stringent quality requirements of urban markets. In addition to the underlying driver of strong market demand for quality meat, several factors contributed to this transition: (i) a convincing innovation – the use of farm-grown fodder – that provided immediate benefits to farmers and provided a vision for local stakeholders; (ii) a participatory, systems-oriented innovation process that emphasised capacity strengthening; (iii) a value chain approach that linked farmers and local traders to markets; (iv) the formation of a loosely structured coalition of local stakeholders that facilitated and managed the innovation process; and (v) technical support over a sufficiently long time period to allow innovation processes to become sustainable...|$|E

30|$|Traditionally, {{livestock}} {{has been}} an important source of livelihood in most of the villages. The villagers used to leave their cattle and buffaloes in the KNP for weeks and months. Since the entry of livestock into KNP for grazing was banned in the early 1980 s, villagers were forced to take cattle to grazing lands in neighboring Dholpur district, a long journey that has increasingly become difficult. The inaccessibility to grazing lands and fodder being a major factor, conjointly with other developments in the area such as increasing tourism, education, and exposure, there has been a paradigm shift in the preference of villagers towards other means of income than their traditional ones. Consequently, the dependency of the villages on livestock for income has become less. Bahnera (38.1 %) tops the list of villages leaving livestock. Naswaria (37.5 %) tops the list of those who are shifting towards livestock (Fig.  5) perhaps for the rising need of milk in the growing city and outskirts. This would also mean a shift in their practice of livestock rearing, from free ranging to <b>stall-feeding,</b> and consequent need for fetching fodder and feed from elsewhere, market or other sources. Furthermore, livestock occupies traditional importance in the socio-economic milieu of the bucolic life. Some villagers reportedly smuggle their cattle to the KNP through breaches in the boundary walls for grazing. Many of the villagers expressed their misgivings about the ban on grazing since they view grazing as their historical right.|$|E

Information was obtained from a survey of livestock feed and fodder collection and utilization from 316 randomly selected households distributed across four government-defined forest density classes, namely very dense forest, moderately dense forest, open forest and scrub. Households obtained feed and fodder for livestock from three sources, i. e. forest areas, non-forest areas and local markets. Daily feed consumption per adult cattle unit varied according to source, ranging from 9. 85 to 14. 70 kg from forest areas, 7. 40 to 11. 14 kg from non-forest areas, and less than 1 kg from local markets. The dependency of households on fodder for livestock differed significantly between households located in each forest density classes.

However, it is becoming clear that the dairy farmers are challenged and in the recent past, milk production has not kept up with the demand.

In endeavours to offer solutions and help the dairy farmers improve their production and become resilient, different stakeholders have advocated for adoption of milk and forage production-enhancing innovations by the dairy farmers. This study sought to establish the kind of innovations and adaptive measures carried out by the peri-urban dairy farmers in south eastern Kenya to improve their milk production and their significance to milk production. A sample of 150 farmers from the peri-urban environs of Wote and Machakos towns was used. A semi-structured questionnaire was used and data analysized using descriptive and inferential statistics.

40|$|A {{classification}} {{of the major}} ruminant livestock production systems in West Africa is proposed. The proposed typology has two major classes of systems-sole livestock and crop-livestock. The sole livestock class has two systems (rangeland-based and landless) and the crop-livestock class has three sub-classes (annual crop-livestock, tree-crop-livestock and irrigated/flooded cropland-livestock). Within the 3 crop-livestock subclasses 13 systems defined by the dominant crops are identified. The systems, including the specific roles of crops and livestock are described, their feed production potential is assessed, and the factors likely to be driving their evolution are discussed. The large majority of producers in these systems are poor and their land and animal holdings are small. Pastoral systems evolve in response to risks associated with uncertainty of rain {{and the demand for}} live animals in the highly populated and more urbanised wetter zones. Crop-livestock systems are more labour-intensive, in some cases they include animal traction, and are characterised by higher use of agricultural inputs such as fertilisers, pesticides and feed supplements. Landless, <b>stall-feeding</b> systems, which exist alongside or within other systems evolve primarily in response to demand for meat and are frequently associated with religious events. The proposed typology offers a framework for identifying Development priorities and research opportunities.

30|$|Chapter 3 {{defines the}} drivers clearly, {{highlights}} the declining traditional systems, and shows that recent interventions {{have not been}} successful. The chapter draws attention to urbanization as {{a link between the}} production and the consumption chains. Livestock production can be seen as natural activity and is less dependent on industrial investment. The economy of the West African region is still based on subsistence farming, with livestock providing both the economic and social capital as well as the source of draught power for agricultural farming. <b>Stall-feeding</b> is becoming more common in peri-urban areas, while in the rural areas the link between livestock and crop cultivation remains strong. The herders combine transhumance grazing with use of crop residue as livestock feed; this is made available through mutually beneficial social arrangements. The reliance on donor support and the weakening of local institutions has, however, undermined any expansion in livestock production. The encroachments by crop cultivators on grazing lands squeezed livestock into limited areas for grazing, with a resulting reduction in the biodiversity of the grazing lands. While repeating views that ascribe land degradation and desertification to over-grazing by livestock, the authors of the chapter admit that 'there seem[s] to be insufficient data on actual soil conditions and/or productivity to support findings of inexorable and inevitable degradation and serious nutrient depletion' (p. 38). The authors place the responsibility for the loss of pastoral land on the exclusion of pastoralists from decision-making. Thus, the decline in resources was not followed by improved state intervention; rather, concessions were made in a 'piecemeal' fashion (p. 39). Consequently, increased urbanization and growing consumer demand have led to the intensification of production. The authors conclude that 'despite the positive response from farmers and communities to meet the growing demand in animal products in the context of shrinking resource base, there has been a widening gap between demand and domestic supply of animal products' (p. 49), thus making the West African region a net importer of livestock products.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to gain insight into the {{household}} and farm economics of small-scale dairy farmers in Hanoi, and to obtain estimates of their costs per unit of output in milk production so as to gauge their potential for improvement and vulnerability to international competition. Costs of production are assessed using market prices and 'social' prices using a policy analysis matrix (PAM) approach. The study applies a method of economic analysis developed by the International Farm Comparison Network (IFCN) which is based on the concept of 'typical farms'. Three farm types were selected to represent typical farms in the region of Hanoi, Viet Nam. The farms were located in two villages near Hanoi (10 to 15 km away), benefiting from good market access. The farms kept two, four and five crossbred dairy cows and practiced <b>stall-feeding.</b> Each farm was analyzed in detail and assets, production costs, profits and other economic information are presented graphically and are described in the text. A policy analysis using the PAM methodology is carried out for each of the typical farms. Furthermore, a preliminary analysis of the dairy chain in Hanoi was conducted. Applying market prices, cost of milk production varies from 11. 5 to 17. 0 US$ per 100 kg energy corrected milk. The farm with four dairy cows has the lowest costs (11. 5 US$), which is mainly due to lower labour costs for family labour and lower costs for means of production. A set of PAM ratios shows that farm outputs are supported and inputs are taxed by 21. 5 and 20. 0 percent respectively. The net result is that all farms benefit significantly from current policies and market conditions and about 24 percent of the private returns of the farms come from external support. Public support for the farms ranges from 6. 0 US$/ 100 kg milk for the smallest to 9. 5 US$/ 100 kg milk to the largest farm. The high level of support clearly indicates a high degree of imperfection in the Vietnamese dairy market. Consequently, there should be potential for increasing productivity and competitiveness through policy measures. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|E

The literatures used here are 2 ̆ 2 British Farming 2 ̆ 2 written by Wilson and country reports of agriculture in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. The conclusion gained is the followings: that is; With the rises of corn- and livestock-prices and improvement of a means of communication such as the extention of railway under the economic prosperity at Victorian Era, in arable enterprise, drill-husbandry that consists of deep-plough, drill-plough and hoe-plough degelops, more fertilization is fostered by uses of purchased fertilizer and good, more dung, and land improvements by which it improves heavy soil and marsh lands are brought. As the result, alternative system of corn crops and fodder crops is general, and its crop very increases. The other hand, in livestock enterprise, with introduction of superior breeds of cattle and sheep such as Shorthorn, Hereford, Improved Leicester and Southdown and so on, -as for the process of improving breeds of livestock, as the supplementary section of this chapter, author examines the process of improving Jersey cattle that is one of Channel Island Breeds, as a case-, the improvement and evolution of the feeding methods of livestock that contains the advance of <b>stall-feeding,</b> more uses of turnip, grasses and purchased feed, and establishment of machines (of steam-engine) and implements of cooking those feed, is brought, consequently, livestok is increased both in quantity and quality.

40|$|Keywords: Dairy cows, Perennial ryegrass, Rumen fill, Clearance, Degradation, Grazing behaviour. In {{temperate}} environments, {{perennial ryegrass}} {{is the most}} widely used species for feeding dairy cows. That is because of its high productivity, palatability, digestibility and nutritive value. However, perennial ryegrass suffers from two main disadvantages: firstly, its unbalanced nutrient content in terms of crude protein (CP) and energy availability at rumen level and secondly, its low dry matter intake (DMI) by high producing dairy cows. In ruminant animals, DMI {{is a function of the}} balance between eating motivation, which is strongly related to palatability, on one hand and rumen capacity on the other. This thesis was divided into three parts: the first part aimed to investigate the possibility of improving pasture DMI by increasing rumen capacity. Rumen capacity is related to the rate of clearance (Kcl) of material from the rumen, which is the summation of both rates of degradation (kd) and passage (kp). Six varieties of perennial ryegrass were screened for their clearance and degradation rates using in vitro, in vivo and in situ techniques. The results suggested that there is a narrow range for selection with respect to clearance and degradation rate. The second part of this thesis aimed at investigating the possibility of improving pasture DMI by improving its palatability. Palatability is mainly a function of flavour and taste, which arise from certain compounds in the grass, especially water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC). High sugar grass varieties were fed to dairy cows in mid lactation. The results showed that feeding high sugar grass did not lead to an improved DMI and milk yield under both <b>stall-feeding</b> and grazing conditions. Moreover, milk composition in terms of fat, protein and lactose, rumen pH, fibre clearance and degradation rates were not influenced. However, rumen ammonia and milk urea concentrations were significantly reduced when feeding high sugar grass. The third part of this thesis aimed to investigate the role rumen fill and fermentation end products may play in signalling the termination of a grazing bout, especially the dusk grazing bout of dairy cows under continuous stocking. It was found that dairy cows interrupted the first two main grazing bouts at the morning and afternoon long before their maximal rumen capacity was reached. Moreover, rumen fill was always maximal at the time when the dusk grazing bout ceased indicating that rumen fill is more likely to play a major role in signalling the termination of the dusk grazing bout...|$|E

Because as in Chapter II, the factors affecting the development of Mixed Husbandry is examined England as a whole, Chapter III aims to point out its characteristics at the stage of individual farm management. Chapter IV supplements this study, for one of the characteristics of the agriculture under the Period of High Farming is more uses of purchased fertilizer than previous periods, and so in this case, it is very important what more uses of purchased fertilizer effect on the system of English farming. Though author feels sorry not to sum shortly those contents here, he remarks some points to be cleared through this study. Author places Norfolk Husbandry as Early Priod of the Development of Mixed Husbandry for the reason why Norfolk Husbandry at Agricultural Revolution Period is one of having certain peculiarity and regional limitation, and then, the factors that it extends to the whole of England and realizes higher productivity under the Period of High Farming is (i) in arable enterprise, the development of drill husbandry, more fertilization (by means of more dung and purchased fertilizer), and the evolution of land improvements (by pipe-draining and the mixing the soil), (ii) in livestock enterprise, the introduction of livestocks of superior breed as Shorthorn and Southdown and so on, and the improvement and development of the feeding methods of livestock (the evolution of <b>stall-feeding,</b> more uses of turnip, grasses and purchased feed such as oil-cake and linseed-cake, the establishment of the machines and implements of cooking those feed, and the erection of liquid manure tank), (iii) the rese of prices of corn and livestock, and the degelopment of means of communication which aspire those technical progress. Accordingly, under the presence of above mentioned economic and technical factors under the Period of High Farming, the extended reproduction function that contains 2 ̆ 2 introduction of turnip and clover→increase of livestock productivity→increase of dung→increase of arable productivity 2 ̆ 2 which is generally pointed as a characteristics attended to Norfolk Husbandry at Agricultural Revolution Period, is more completely, more extensively realized. 前稿においてはイギリス農業全体として混合農業の展開条件を考察したのであるが,本章では個別経営の段階における混合農業の経営・技術的特性を検討する. 個別経営事例の検討によって,その特性がより明確に浮きでると考えるからである. このばあい,Caird (1852) の 2 ̆ 2 English Agriculture in 1850 - 512 ̆ 2 を主要資料とする.

40|$|In this study, author {{deals with}} the factors {{affecting}} the development of Mixed Husbandry under the Period of High Farming, at {{the middle of the}} 19 th century, which has not been amply examined in the study of English agriculture in Japan. But this study is very important to gain clear knowledge about the developing process of English agriculture. Under the consideration of it, author divides English agriculture between 18 th and 19 th centruies into the following three periods from the viewpoint of the degree of the development of Mixed Husbandry. I. Early Period of the Development of Mixed Husbandry: the stage of Norfolk Husbandry having certain peculiarity and regional limitation at Agricultural Revelution Period. II. Period of Mixed Husbandry: the stage that the Mixed Husbandry extends to the whole of England and develops more highly under the Period of High Farming. III. Period of the Re-arrangement of Mixed Husbandry: the stage that the Mixed Husbandry is chiefly changed to Animal Husbandry at the Great Depression Period. And, then, author makes clear the economic and technical factors for developming from Early Period to Mixed Husbandry Period. In addition to this, author studies the relation between purchased fertilizer and the development of Mixed Husbandry. In the present paper (Study I), author examines the reason why Norfolk Husbandry at Agricultural Revolution Period is placed as Early Period of the Development of Mixed Husbandry through the examination of the useful literature as books written by Marshall, Kent and Young. With the advance of Industrial Revolution, the increase of wheat production is demanded, and Norfolk Husbandry becomes to be greatly noticed in England. For Norfolk Husbandry has the scientific rotation including turnip and clover in its system and has mutual relation between livestock enterprise and arable enterprise, so that higher crop is produced. However, that it is the Husbandry having certain peculiarity and regional limitation, author concludes from the following reasens; that is, i) the existence of Norfolk light soil easy for introducing turnip, and Early Enclosure and Early Development of large sized farm based of the system of field peculiar to East Anglia couties, ii) that turnip is cultivated by broadcasting and hand hoeing, and by cheaper skillful labourers than other counties, and iii) that many of the livestocks feeded is not superior breeds, but natives, the feeding method of them is not completely changed to <b>stall-feeding</b> in Norfolk, and the demand for animal foods rather decrease for higher price of wheat at Agricultural Revolution Period. Accordingly, though it is generally said that extended reproduction function that contains 2 ̆ 2 introduction of turnip and clover→increase of livestock productivity→increase of dung→increase of arable productivity 2 ̆ 2 characterizes the nature of Norfolk Husbandry, author concludes that it exists in Early Period of the Development of Mixed Husbandry. 本論では農業革命以後の,とくに穀物法撤廃以後のハイ･ファーミング期における混合農業(Mixed Husbandry) の展開を考察の対象にする. このばあい,混合農業とは岩片(1951) によると, 2 ̆ 2 穀物関税の廃止以後,実質賃銀が高まっていくにつれて,畜産食糧に対する需要が旺盛になったことは, 19 世紀の中葉までに輸栽式をいよいよ一般的ならしめたのであって,この経営方式は 19 世紀の 70 年代に最高潮に達したわけである. 英国で一般に混合農業(原文では混同農業である…筆者注) と呼ばれるこの方式は,経営に対しては穀物と養畜との収益のバランスのうえに成立した 2 ̆ 2 (岩片, 1951, 14 - 15 貢). その他の識者による混合農業の規定をみると, 2 ̆ 2 穀物と畜産との結合 2 ̆ 2,あるいは 2 ̆ 2 耕地と牧草地との結合 2 ̆ 2 (Levy, 1966,p. 59), 2 ̆ 2 ノーフォーク方式の原型に緬羊や肉牛などの肥育をバランスよく結合させた農法 2 ̆ 2 (小林, 1973, 59 頁), 2 ̆ 2 穀物と緬羊か牛かいずれか, あるいは双方の飼養を組合わせる方式, つまり,飼料作物と穀作物との輪作,耕地緬羊(arable herds) と畜舎内牛(yard-feeding cattle) を飼養するノーフォーク 4 圃輪栽式 2 ̆ 2 (Jones, 1962,p. 109) 等である. したがって,本論では混合農業をハイ･ファーミング期における経済的･技術的条件のもとで,別種部門と畜産部門とが補合･補完的に結合し,しかも穀物と家畜とが収益的にバランスよく結合した農業と理解する...|$|E
40|$|Climate-smart {{approaches}} have gained momentum in tropical, agricultural development. However, to date, {{few studies have}} examined whole-farm greenhouse gas (GHG) balances in smallholder crop-livestock systems. This study aimed to quantify GHG balances at farm-scale, identify GHG hotspots and assess mitigation options in coffee-dairy farms undergoing agricultural intensification in Central Kenya. In recent decades, decreasing farm size has forced the shift from extensive practices to zero-grazing systems and higher nitrogen (N) inputs. We hypothesised that different farm strategies and intensification levels determine the farm’s GHG balance. A farm typology was constructed through principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering from 125 farms surveyed. Four farm types were identified ranging relatively from small to large farms, low to high li- vestock intensities, and low to high N input rates. Whole-farm GHG balances were estimated using an adapted version of the Cool Farm Tool (CFT). Farms were found to be net sources of GHG, averaging from 4. 5 t CO 2 eq ha− 1 yr− 1 in less intensive farms to 12. 5 t CO 2 eq ha− 1 yr− 1 in high intensive farms. Within the farm GHG hotspots identified, methane (CH 4) from enteric fermentation processes accounted for 26 – 39 % of total farm GHG emissions; nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and CH 4 from manure management systems (MMS) for 26 – 38 %; soil background and fertilizer induced N 2 O emissions for 24 – 29 %; off-farm production of feeds and agrochemicals for 10 – 22 %; and crop residue management (CRM) for the remaining 1 – 3 %. Within the mitigation practices assessed, zero-grazing stalls already lowered the livestock maintenance energy requirements, reducing enteric fermentation emissions. <b>Stall-feeding,</b> however, brings the necessity-opportunity to manage the manure and our results showed that MMS can be a determining factor in the GHG balance. Increasing the frequency of manure collection from stalls in favour of solid storage systems can reduce N 2 O emissions by up to 75 %. Furthermore, dry manure storage reduced the CH 4 emissions of liquid slurry systems by more than 70 %. Further benefits in terms of carbon (C) sequestration were identified along farm types from manure and crop residues applications in soils (with averages of − 1. 3 to − 2. 3 t CO 2 eq ha− 1 yr− 1) and biomass growth in agroforestry systems (− 1. 2 to − 2 t CO 2 eq ha− 1 yr− 1). Together, soils and woody biomass offset 25 – 36 % of farm emissions. We conclude that reduced farm size and increased livestock density lead to higher emissions per unit area, though this in- crease is smoothed by larger negative fluxes in soils (by higher C inputs) and woody biomass (by higher tree densities) until a steady state is reached. Average yield-scaled emissions, or product carbon footprints (CFs), resulted in 1. 08 kg CO 2 eq kg coffee berry− 1, 0. 64 kg CO 2 eq kg maize− 1 and 1. 05 kg CO 2 eq kg milk− 1 on average. CFs did not always differ between farm types and intensification levels, meaning that increases in productivity were not higher than increases in GHG fluxes from intensification. This may be due to: 1) increases in productivity are the result of more processes other than N inputs; and/or 2) emissions from N inputs are overestimated by EFs and GHG calculators. Smallholders may benefit in the near future from climate initiatives and further field characterisation, models calibration and monitoring are required to overcome critical levels of uncertainty and provide more accurate estimations of GHG balances at farm-scale.

40|$|The study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} genotype and grainless diets under stall-fed (n= 72) conditions on the following parameters using the Afar, Central Highland goats, (CHG) and Long-eared Somali, (LES) goats. The diets varied in concentrate: roughage ratios. Diet 1 was a 50 : 50 ratio (8. 5 MJ ME/kg DM), Diet 2, 65 : 35 (9. 2 MJ ME/kg DM) and Diet 3 an 80 : 20 ratio (10 MJ ME/kg DM), respectively. The same genotypes reared under the extensive grazing systems were also evaluated. Intake, feed efficiency (FE) and rumen parameters Total DMI ranged between 2. 6 and 3. 0 % on a body weight basis and between 53. 5 and 62. 3 g per kg metabolic body weight. The LES had a higher (P 0. 05) FE. The mean concentration of NH 3 -N (39. 4 - 53. 7 mg/ 100 ml rumen fluid) was above the N requirements for optimal microbial activity. The mean pH was similar between diets and ranged from 6. 43 to 6. 63. Total VFA was depressed (P 0. 05) from 64. 5 to 65. 7, 17. 7 to 18. 8 and 10. 7 to 12. 8 %, respectively. The ratio of acetic: propionic was not affected by diet (P> 0. 05) and ranged from 3. 5 to 3. 81. The values for degradation constants were similar (P> 0. 05) between the diets. However, the hay DM and neutral detergent fibre were more degradable (P 0. 05) for most of carcass traits, at an average slaughter weight of 13. 8 kg. The genotypes had a mean hot carcass weight of 5. 9 kg and a dressing percentage (DP) on a slaughter body weight basis of 42. 8 %. The CHG had a 52 % higher (P 0. 05) chemical fat percentage. The composition of most muscle fatty acids was affected by genotype. The LES breed presented a beneficial ratio of n- 6 : n- 3 PUFA favorable to consumers’ health. The goats under the extensive system in general, were characterized by a lower carcass weight and poor carcass fat cover. Hence, to improve the carcass characteristics {{it is essential that}} grazing goats should be supplemented or stall-fed with locally available concentrates depending on the grazing resources of the agro-ecologies and the objectives of the goat farmers. Growth and carcass characteristics of stall-fed goats The LES breed had significantly higher growth rates (ADG), heavier pre-slaughter, slaughter, empty body weight (EBW) and carcass weights than the Afar and CHG goats. Effect of diet was also significant on ADG, but similar for carcass traits, except for DP on EBW basis and some non-carcass components. The DP on an EBW basis, was the highest (P< 0. 01) for Diet 1. <b>Stall-feeding</b> of the goats improved the mean carcass weight by 38 % over the initial slaughtered groups. Genotype affected the DP and it ranged from 42. 5 to 44. 6 % and 54. 3 to 55. 8 % on a slaughter weight and on EBW basis, respectively. The ultimate carcass pH was between 5. 61 and 5. 67 and chilling losses ranged from 2. 5 to 3. 1 %. The rib physical composition (fat and bone) differed between genotype and ranged from 72 - 73 %, 6. 9 - 10. 9 % and 17. 1 - 20. 2 % for muscle, fat and bone respectively. The findings indicate that breed differences were reflected in carcass characteristics. Meat quality of stall-fed goats Genotype significantly influenced the carcass fat and crude protein (CP) concentration, with the values ranging from 10. 3 to 14. 0 % and 19. 3 to 21. 1 %, respectively. The Afar and LES goats had higher fat concentration (P< 0. 001) compared to the CHG while the CP was higher (P< 0. 01; P< 0. 05) for the CHG. The effect of diet was significant on CP%, but was similar for fat concentration although Diet 3 tended to have a higher value. Cooking and drip loss differed (P< 0. 01, P< 0. 05) between genotypes and both traits increased with increased fatness. The effect of diet however, was similar for cooking and drip loss. Genotype and diet significantly influenced the composition of most muscle fatty acids. An interaction between genotype and diet was also exhibited on certain fatty acids. Compared to CHG, Afar and LES breeds had a higher PUFA, MUFA and UFA: SFA ratio, which are considered healthier for human consumption due to their lowering effect of cholesterol content. The relatively higher carcass fat, which is useful in reducing chilling loss and improves eating quality, the absence of C 12 : 0 and lower concentration of C 14 : 0, hypercholesterolemic, and higher C 18 : 1, hypocholesterolemic fatty acids, are some of the important traits observed in Ethiopian goats. These findings suggest that a potential exists in the use of Ethiopian goat breeds fed a grainless diet, for the production of meat with specific quality characteristics.
