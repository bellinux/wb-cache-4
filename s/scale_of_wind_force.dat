D., and the artist and landscape architect Adam Bobbette, whose recent projects engage the problems and ambiguities of the elemental and their attendant forms of composition, in relation to wind and fire, respectively. In both Shaw 2 ̆ 7 s curatorial project developed through her engagement with Sir Francis Beaufort 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>Force,</b> and Bobbette 2 ̆ 7 s project for {{a guide to the}} 2 ̆ 7 Combustible City 2 ̆ 7 of Manhattan, there is an attempt to relate the force of the elemental to the form of composition in the work of curation and artistic practice. The discussion will be moderated by Etienne Turpin, Ph. D., whose recent work also engages themes of the elemental, primarily through his study of the Anthropocene and its legibility in Northern Ontario, Canada. The panel will develop the theme of 2 ̆ 7 the elemental 2 ̆ 7 as an anticipation of and an analog to the pharmakon through an interrogation of the ambiguities, reversabilities, and elisions that the forces of the elemental make manifest. The goal of this panel is to discuss recent projects by Shaw and Bobbette that signal the strange yet productive force of elemental autoantonymics - those grandparents of the pharmakon - as they relate to current themes in aesthetics, urban ecology, and philosophy...|$|E
40|$|The GFDL-MOM, being {{designed}} for global scale modelling (#OMICRON#(100 km)), is tested {{for its ability}} to simulate mesoscale phenomena (#OMICRON#(10 km)) in shelf seas like the Baltic. The dynamics of the Baltic are mainly <b>forced</b> by <b>wind</b> and air pressure, typical time scales are 3 - 5 days. The typical spatial <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> <b>forced</b> processes like Kelvin waves, coastal jets, coastal upwelling and so on is the 1 st baroclinic Rossby radius (in the Baltic 2 - 7 km). It will be examined if the numerical model is able to describe these processes with their correct spatial and temporal behaviour. The influence of different parameters of the model as for example horizontal gridpoint distance or the parameterisation of mixing processes on the model results are examined. The high variability of the windinduced processes makes it difficult to compare model results and measurements. Thats why model results are compared with analytical calculations. It can be shown by this comparison that the model gives a good description of the characteristic processes if the horizontal grid spacing is less then 1 / 3 of the local 1 st baroclinic Rossby-Radius. In different model runs coastal processes are stimulated by suitable wind fields. Their characteristics (like spatial scale and progression velocity) agree with the results from analytical theory. Their temporal and spacial evolution agree with given measurements. The results of this article show that the chosen, for global questions designed model, is an appropriate tool for local studies of mesoscale processes. (orig.)

40|$|International audienceWe {{experimentally}} and numerically {{investigate the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> <b>forcing</b> on the spectral dynamics of Akhmediev breathers, a wave-type known {{to model the}} modulation instability. We develop the wind model to the same order in wave steepness as the higher order modification of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, {{also referred to as}} the Dysthe equation. This results in an asymmetric wind term in the higher order, in addition to the leading order <b>wind</b> <b>forcing</b> term. The derived model is in good agreement with laboratory experiments within the range of the facility’s length. We show that the leading order forcing term amplifies all frequencies equally and therefore induces only a broadening of the spectrum, while the asymmetric higher order term in the model enhances the higher frequencies more than the lower ones. Thus, the latter term induces a permanent upshift in the spectral mean. On the other hand, in contrast to the direct effect <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> <b>forcing,</b> <b>wind</b> can indirectly lead to frequency downshifts, due to dissipative effects such as wave breaking, or through the amplification of the intrinsic spectral asymmetry of the Dysthe equation.
