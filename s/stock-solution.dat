30|$|A {{solution}} of OTC (oxytetracycline hydrochloride, HPLC grade ≥  95  % purity, Sigma-Aldrich) was previously prepared at 240  mg L− 1 (<b>stock-solution)</b> in a buffer {{solution of}} sodium acetate (Synth)/acetic acid (Synth) at 0.1  mol L− 1 in ultrapure water (Milli-Q). The prepared working concentrations from the <b>stock-solution</b> were 120, 60, 30, 20, 10, and 5  mg L− 1, with a control solution of 0  mg L− 1 of OTC (buffer solution). A 10  mL aliquot of each solution {{was transferred to}} amber glass flask and, immediately, added to the soil mass to a final concentration of 5  g L− 1 of soil at OTC solution. The mixtures were shaken for 48  h, protected from light and at room temperature (25  °C), and after this period followed for chromatographic analysis, the results {{were used in the}} construction of the sorption isotherms.|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} and specific {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} combined with electrospray ionization (ESI) tandemmass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, operating in the positive ionization mode, for quantifying of amlodipine in humanplasma using tizanidine as internal standard (I. S.) was developed and validated. The analyte and I. S. were extracted bysimple one step liquid/liquid extraction {{with a mixture of}} diethylether/dichloromethane (70 / 30, v/v). The chromatographicseparation was performed on a C 18 analytical column under isocratic conditions using a mixture of 10 mM ammoniumformate/methanol/acetonitrile (30 / 50 / 20, v/v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1. 0 mL/min. Total chromatographic runtime was 5. 0 min. Detection was performed on a API 2000 QTRAP quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer via turboion spray ionization. Quantitation was performed using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode to study parent ®product ion transitions of m/z 409. 4 ® 238. 1 for amlodipine and m/z 254. 2 ® 44. 1 for I. S., respectively. The validation andstability studies were performed according to the Thai FDA guidance for assessment of bioequivalence study in Thailand. The results were within the accepted criteria as stated in the aforementioned guidance. Linearity in plasma was obtained overthe concentration range 0. 3 - 15. 0 ng/mL, with a coefficient of determination (r 2) of 0. 9993. Lower limit of quantification(LLOQ) was identifiable and reproducible at 0. 3 ng/mL. The within- and between-run precision values were below 10 %and the accuracy was ranged from 94. 87 to 102. 44 % at all three quality controls samples levels. The analyte was found tobe stable in plasma samples under three freeze-thaw cycles, long-term storage (3 months at - 20 oC), short-term storage (4 hours at room temperature), post-preparative and <b>stock-solution</b> stability. The robust and rapid LC-MS/MS method has beensuccessfully applied for routine assay to support bioequivalence or pharmacokinetics studies of amlodipine administeredas a single oral dose (10 mg tablet) to Thai healthy volunteers...|$|E
40|$|A TLC-densitometric {{method was}} used for the {{parallel}} quantification of rosmarinic acid (RA) and caffeic acid (CA) in crude extracts of Salvia species (Family Lamiaceae), obtained by ultrasonic extraction with 60 % methanol. The densitometric measurement was performed in fluorescent mode as it has been published earlier. The applicability of the method has been investigated mainly from the viewpoint of the starting material. Questions are discussed like, what kind of factors should be taken into account, if the drugs are to be characterized, and how the RA and CA contents of samples vary in the plants are discussed. The drugs (plant material) show great differences due to the time of harvest of time, to the organ composition of drugs, to the extraction and storage conditions of the <b>stock-solutions</b> prepared from them. The importance of these parameters is illustrated on Salvia species native to Hungary...|$|R
40|$|Most {{synthetic}} {{chemicals used}} to control phytoparasites are toxic to humans and animals, and can accumulate in the soil and in food plants. The bioactive potential of essential oils (EOs) has been recognized, albeit empirically, for centuries. In the present work, the nematicidal potential of EOs extracted from 16 Eucalyptus spp., six Thymus spp. and four Mentha spp., from the Portuguese flora, were assessed. EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation and identified by GC and GC-MS. EO/methanol <b>stock-solutions</b> were added to 50 - 100 mixed-stage B. xylophilus suspensions to attain 2 and 1 μl EO/ml of suspension final concentration. After 24 h in darkness, dead and live nematodes were counted. Assays were repeated, at least, 10 times in 2 series. Of all Eucalyptus spp. EOs, only the citronellal-rich (36 %) E. citriodora EO showed 97 % mortality, at 2 μl/ml. Thymus zygis, T. vulgaris and one chemotype of T. caespititius EOs revealed 100 % mortality at 2 and 1 μl/ml. T. zygis and T. vulgaris EOs were thymol-rich (≈ 50 %) and T. caespititius EO was carvacrol-rich (58 %). Mentha arvensis EO, dominated by piperitone oxide (56 %), also revealed {{to be an effective}} nematicide, showing 100 % mortality in both concentrations. Additional studies are being carried out to identify the most effective components from each oil.

40|$|The {{pinewood}} nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus {{is a highly}} pathogenic plant parasite that greatly affects pine forests. In Portugal, the most affected species is Pinus pinaster Aiton. Despite great efforts, since its fist detection in 1999, the PWN has spread through the country, including Madeira Island, having been recently detected in Spain [1, 2]. Containing this pest is {{of the utmost importance}} for European pine forest safeguard. Since most synthetic chemicals used to control phytoparasites are toxic to humans and animals, and can accumulate in the soil and in food plants [3], in the present work, the nematoxic potential of over 80 essential oils (EOs), isolated from the Portuguese flora, were assessed against the PWN. EOs were isolated by hydrodistillation and analysed by GC and GC-MS [3]. EOs hydrocarbon and oxygen-containing fractions were obtained as in [4]. Direct-contact assays, adapted from [3], were performed by adding EOs/methanol <b>stock-solutions</b> to 50 - 100 mixed-stage PWN suspensions. After 24 h in darkness, dead and live nematodes were counted under an inverted microscope. Assays were repeated at least 10 times in two series. Mortalities ≥ 96 % were obtained with 2 μL/mL of the EOs isolated from Cymbopogon citratus, Eucalyptus citriodora, Mentha arvensis, Origanum virens, Origanum vulgare, Ruta graveolens, Satureja montana, Syzygium aromaticum, Thymbra capitata, Thymus caespititius (carvacrol and/or thymol-rich), Thymus vulgaris and Thymus zygis. These EOs were further tested at 1, 0. 5 and 0. 25 μL/mL. Minimum lethal concentrations (LC 100) < 0. 4 μL/mL, were obtained for the 2 -undecanone-rich R. graveolens EO and the carvacrol and γ-terpinene-rich S. montana and T. capitata EOs. Assays with EO fractions revealed that the monoterpene-rich nematoxic EOs control PWN through their combined hydrocarbon and oxygen-containing fractions through additive and/or synergic relations. As complex mixtures of active components, EOs may prove to be effective nematoxic age nts...|$|R
