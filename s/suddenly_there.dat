25|$|<b>Suddenly</b> <b>there</b> was {{a series}} of ear-splitting explosions, as Fame dropped a pattern of 10 depth charges. The lights in U-353 went out and water entered forward and aft through the {{hydrophone}} shafts. The electric motors stopped working, {{all but one of the}} depth gauges broke, and the aft hydroplanes were put out of action. U-353 went deeper, almost out of control as water poured in through the stern torpedo tube causing her to lose trim. The U-boat blew her tanks and surfaced, and the captain ordered the crew to prepare to abandon ship.|$|E
25|$|The Rams {{were the}} first team in the NFL to play in Los Angeles (the 1926 Los Angeles Buccaneers were {{strictly}} a road team), {{but they were not}} the only professional football team to play its home games in the Coliseum between 1946 and 1949. The upstart All-America Football Conference had the Los Angeles Dons compete there as well. Reeves was taking a gamble that Los Angeles was ready for its own professional football team – and <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> were two in the City of Angels. Reeves was proven to be correct when the Rams played their first pre-season game against the Washington Redskins in front of a crowd of 95,000 fans. The team finished their first season in L.A. with a 6–4–1 record, second place behind the Chicago Bears. At {{the end of the season}} Walsh was fired as head coach. The Coliseum would be the home of the Rams for more than 30 years, but the facility was already over 20 years old on the day of the first kickoff.|$|E
25|$|Though now {{a private}} member, Harcourt still {{continued}} to assert his independent position, and his {{attacks on the}} government were no longer restrained by any deference to Liberal Imperialism. He actively intervened in 1899 and 1900, strongly condemning the government's financial policy and their attitude towards the Transvaal. Throughout the Second Boer War he lost no opportunity of criticising the South African developments in a pessimistic vein. A great parliamentary debater, he sprinkled his speeches with humour. From 1898 to 1900 he was conspicuous, both on the platform and in letters to The Times, in demanding active measures against Ritualism in the Church of England. However, his attitude in this was reflected in his political advocacy of disestablishment. In March 1904, just after he had announced his intention not to seek election again to parliament, he succeeded, {{by the death of}} his nephew, to the family estates at Nuneham. He found that the estate was in crisis, especially after having to pay the death duties he himself had introduced, and he died <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> in the same year.|$|E

500|$|A {{spaceship}} appears out {{of nowhere}} over Atlantis. John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) and his team discover that the ship is the Daedalus, which is strange as Stargate Command confirms that the Daedalus is actually two days away from Earth. Sheppard's team boards the new Daedalus and find it apparently abandoned with signs of battle damage. Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) views a log entry from the Daedalus commander, Colonel Sobel, who the team has never heard of before. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>there</b> is a power spike and the Daedalus disappears from above Atlantis, while {{from the perspective of}} Sheppard's team, Atlantis disappears. McKay finds that they have been propelled into a parallel universe by what he terms an [...] "alternate reality drive", and thus the Daedalus is actually from an alternate reality.|$|E
500|$|Harry later said: [...] "The newspapers, television, theatres {{and radio}} were all run {{by people of}} a {{different}} generation who {{had no idea of}} what youngsters wanted. For decades they had manipulated and controlled them. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>there</b> was an awareness of being young, and young people wanted their own styles and their own music, just at the time they were beginning to earn money, which gave them the spending power. Mersey Beat was their voice, it was a paper for them, crammed with photos and information about their own groups, which is why it also began to appeal to youngsters throughout Britain as its coverage extended to other areas." [...] Because of the employment situation in Liverpool at the time, The Daily Worker newspaper denounced the enthusiasm of younger people in Liverpool by saying [...] "The Mersey Sound is the sound of 30,000 people on the dole." ...|$|E

Angelessa grabs him and throws him out, but not before he can grab Tiger by her sore ribs, leaving her in even more pain.|$|R
500|$|British {{timing was}} good. The Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first {{artificial}} satellite, on 4 October 1957, {{came as a}} tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, <b>suddenly,</b> <b>there</b> was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action {{in response to the}} Sputnik crisis, officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend the relationship with Britain that had been damaged by the Suez Crisis. At the suggestion of Harold Caccia, the British Ambassador to the United States, Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources to meet the challenge. To do this, the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear cooperation needed to be relaxed. British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb. The trenchant opposition from the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy that had derailed previous attempts was absent. Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and were signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958. The 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed on 3 July, and was approved by Congress on 30 July. Macmillan called this [...] "the Great Prize".|$|E
500|$|Rakeysh {{said the}} {{following}} in a scriptwriter's conference {{conducted by the}} Film Writers Association in the year 2008, [...] "I was making a documentary called Mamooli Ram, on the missed revolution with Kamalesh Pandey. We were sitting in a small hotel room in Nanded, drinking. We started singing songs, and we both realised we liked similar songs. And so Rang De Basanti was born. He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted to do so much. But we really can't do anything and it {{was born out of}} anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. We had this amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, [...] "let's do The Young Guns of India". We were going to go on the floor, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> were a couple of film on Bhagat Singh made. But they came and went. Not because they were good or bad films, not because they were written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being judgmental about them. And this is very important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. And you had to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You know what, I think I've cracked it'." ...|$|E

Coward was more forthcoming in a later interview, stating: [...] "As the final approach started I became aware that there was no power ... <b>suddenly</b> <b>there</b> was nothing from any of the engines, and the plane started to glide." ...|$|E
