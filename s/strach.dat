40|$|Intradermal {{injection}} of pruritogens such as serotonin, histamine and compound 48 / 80 {{into the skin}} and then, {{the evaluation of the}} scratching behavior is the commonly used animal model to advance pruritic research and drug development. However, predictive validity of this model is poorly documented. There is a close interaction between itch and pain sensations with regard to mediation through an anatomically and functionally identical neuronal pathway. One approach is whether the existing animal model of itch differentiates itch or pain to show efficacy of clinically effective analgesic drugs as a back translation. In this study, we explored the effects of different group of analgesic drugs on serotonin and compound 48 / 80 -induced scratching behavior in Balb-C mice. Serotonin (25 μg) and compound 48 / 80 (100 μg) was injected intradermally in a volume of 50 μl into the rostral part of skin on the back of male mice and scratches were counted for a 30 -min observation period. Morphine (1, 3, 10 mg/kg), tramadol (20, 40, 80 mg/kg), cannabinoid agonist CP 55, 940 (0. 1, 0. 3, 1 mg/kg), paracetamol (100, 200, 300 mg/kg) and diclofenac (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) were given intraperitoneally 30 min prior to pruritogen injection. The analgesic drugs dose dependently blocked serotonin and compound 48 / 80 -induced <b>straching</b> behavior with exerting complete inhibition at certain doses. Our data suggests that intradermal pruritogen-induced scratching models may not discriminate pain and itch sensations and give false positive results when standard analgesic drugs are used...|$|R

He was known as <b>strach</b> tatarski (Tatar terror) and being a successful commander he brought 500 horsemen and 300 inantry to the army concentration before Kumejki in 1637. During the Kumejki campaign field hetman Mikołaj Potocki ordered Samuel's command to provoke the Cossack to abandon their positions and pursue him. Samuel completed his orders and thus helped achieve the victory over the more numerous rebels. In 1638 he again fought the Cossacks leading his own command, and gaining more military fame.|$|E

The substitution of canna <b>strach</b> affect in the texture of dodol, so it’s necessary to test the texture. The quality of food is also determined by the nutritional content, the proximate compotition testing of dodol canna is also required. The aim of the study was to know the effect of canna starch as a substitute of glutinous rice flour in making dodol. Completely randomized design was used, with four levels of canna starch substitution, were 0 %, 25 %, 50 %,and 75 % with three replications. Texture was measured with tensile strength test. Proximate composition including moisture, ash, protein, fat and carbohydrates were tested using by different method. The acceptance of the product was tested by untrained panelists. The results indicated that there was a significant effect of canna starch substitution on dodol texture. the higher the substitution of canna starch, the lower the texture of dodol. The highest of the texture of dodol was gave by 0 % substitution, followed by 25 %. Proximate compotition of dodol showed that there was an effect of canna starch substitution on protein on dodol. However, there was no effect on moisture, ash and fat contens. The highest acceptance of dodol gave by 0 % substitution, followed by 25 % substitution.
