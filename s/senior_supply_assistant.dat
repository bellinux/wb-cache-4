40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} {{technical}} risks faced by Dubai based large and medium size logistics supply chain companies (LSCC). Middle East {{is attempting to}} turn itself into a multimodal trans-shipment hub for transport, as manufactured goods production has moved from West to East. Thus Dubai port has become the hub, as great freight volumes now transit this region, which has created demand for additional warehousing facilities. As supply chains have lengthened, logistics executives are increasingly responsible for anticipating and eliminating {{a greater number of}} risks. The stakes are high: in the past five years, nearly three-fourths of companies experienced significant disruptions. Also the topic is very important in current context; however, there {{does not seem to be}} much work done in this area in Dubai, a place which is dominated by the LSCC. The findings are based on risk identification and risk analysis through exploratory and empirical survey using a sample size of 50 questionnaires, 7 in-depth interviews and a focus group meeting with <b>senior</b> <b>supply</b> chain executives. The study provides insights into the applicability of technical risks faced by logistics supply chain, Dubai, with respect to severity, degree, speed, amount of forewarning associated and duration of each risk.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a {{conceptual}} model that includes drivers of supply chain management (SCM) adoption and execution identified in the literature, provide a set of measurement scales that operationalise constructs within this model, empirically verify a hierarchical order of antecedents that affects the adoption and execution of SCM, and assist management by providing a focus on those SCM conditions and processes that need to be prioritised to increase successful SCM adoption and execution. Design: The conceptual model is tested empirically through a survey of 174 <b>senior</b> <b>supply</b> chain managers representing the biggest organisations within a central European country. Findings: Using structural equation modelling the hypothesised hierarchical order of three proposed antecedents are verified: ‘internal SCM conditions’ that affect ‘joint or external SCM conditions’ which in turn influences collaborative ‘SCM-related processes’. Firms that adopt these steps should enjoy a rigorous and appropriate road to the full execution of SCM. Research limitations: The survey results reflect the views of large organisations in a country-specific supply chain setting. Practical implications: The findings provide a hierarchical focus for financial, personnel and management initiatives to increase integration within a supply chain and improve competitiveness. Originality/value: The major contribution of this paper is that it provides empirical proof of the antecedents that affect the adoption and execution of SCM...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{supply chain}} risk {{management}} (SCRM) process {{is aimed at}} the implementation of strategies that assist in managing both daily and exceptional risks facing the supply chain through continuous risk assessment to reduce vulnerability and ensure continuity. Purpose: The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine whether the SCRM process enables supply chain resilience among grocery manufacturers in South Africa. The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) -manufacturing industry faces increased risk because of the nature of their products being perishable with a limited shelf life. Method: This study was conducted using a descriptive qualitative research design. Data were collected by means of 12 semi-structured interviews with <b>senior</b> <b>supply</b> chain practitioners within the South African grocery manufacturing industry. Findings: The study found that most firms informally implement SCRM processes of risk identification, assessment, mitigation and monitoring to mitigate disruptions. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the SCRM processes facilitate resilience among grocery manufacturers in South Africa. Conclusion: The managerial implications show that supply chain managers of grocery manufacturers should formalise the SCRM process and develop risk assessment scales to better prioritise risks in order to run a resilient supply chain. The research contributes to the supply chain management field by adding to the scarce literature relating to SCRM as an enabler of supply chain resilience in a South African context. </p...|$|R
