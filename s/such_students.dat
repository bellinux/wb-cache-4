25|$|An August 2009 study {{published}} in Megamot by Sorel Cahan of Hebrew University's School of Education demonstrated that the Israeli Education Ministry's budget for special assistance to students from low socioeconomic backgrounds severely discriminated against Arabs.

This {{was the result of}} the allocation method used â assistance funds were first divided between Arab and Jewish school systems, according to the number of students in each, and then allocated to needy students; however, due to the largest proportion of <b>such</b> <b>students</b> in the Arab system, they received less funds, per student, than Jewish students.
