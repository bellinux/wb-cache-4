30|$|Due to {{the smaller}} class <b>size,</b> <b>Track</b> B allowed for more {{one-on-one}} attention from the instructor as well as group work and class discussions. At times, {{students were able to}} work on in-class problems individually or with a classmate, while the instructor circulated the room assisting students as needed. More time was allotted for questions from students, as well as detailed explanations. Track B also provided students with a second opportunity to master the course content, which allowed for proper scaffolding leading to mastery of material. What transpired in Track B was more than simply a result of a smaller class size. Rather, this was a targeted reduction of class size for those students who were identified through the tests as needing additional intervention and remediation.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. South African companies, {{as well as}} {{international}} companies using South Africa as a base, that have reached an appropriate <b>size,</b> <b>track</b> record and capacity to consider expanding abroad often look at business opportunities in their neighbouring countries, specifically those that {{are members of the}} Southern African Development Corporation (SADC). The markets and business environment of the 15 members in the Community differ substantially amongst themselves, but each has some characteristics and business potential to recommend it to the expansion seeking SA corporation. This paper provides an exhaustive analysis of the SADC's economic environment and characteristics. As such, it makes sense for a South African company that produces high-technology products or services and sells in the business-to-business market space to explore markets in geographical proximity to itself. The existence of the SADC region as a trade block, its associated objectives to improve regional inter-trade and regional socio-economic stability and established infrastructure motivates the focus of this study. It is envisaged that further study could be suggested to identify and develop methods to ascertain market feasibility that could be applied to other countries in Africa and in the world market. According to Thompson (2006 b: 1), a business feasibility study can be defined as “a controlled process for identifying problems and opportunities, determining objectives, describing situations, defining successful outcomes and asssesing the range of costs and benefits associated with several alternatives for solving a problem. ” The identification, extraction, presentation and consolidation of lessons learnt could benefit new market entrants by identifying possible pitfalls before they embark on a market entry campaign. The study delves into the intricacies of doing business in emerging economies, doing business in Africa and doing business in SADC countries. The external and internal forces that could prove instrumental and decisive in the success of an organisation that seeks to measure market feasibility is examined, thus identifying key warning signs or hazards that would hamper feasibility before embarking on costly business plans and marketing campaigns. The study develops a proposed decision support matrix to determine market feasibility. This matrix could prove useful as a preliminary investigation tool for companies active in the sector and exploring the different geographical markets in question to base an initial business decision on, prior to investing in a business plan or more focused business intelligence...|$|E

40|$|Geometrical {{arguments}} {{suggest that}} pore-mediated nucleation happens in general in a two-step fashion, {{the first step}} being nucleation within the pore, the second being nucleation from the filled pore into solution [Page & Sear, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 65701 (2006) ]. The free energy barriers controlling the two steps of this process show opposite dependencies on pore size, implying that for given thermodynamic conditions there exists a pore size for which nucleation happens fastest. Here we show, within the two- and three-dimensional Ising lattice gas, that this preferred pore <b>size</b> <b>tracks</b> the <b>size</b> of the bulk critical nucleus, up to a numerical prefactor. This observation suggests a simple prescription for directing nucleation to certain locations within heterogeneous porous media. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{analysis}} was the influence of working parameters (working pressure and working speed) on +drop <b>tracks</b> <b>size</b> and changes in flow rate level from flat fan nozzle. New nozzles and nozzles after laboratory wear were tested. The influence of nozzles wear on +drop <b>tracks</b> <b>size</b> was examined. It was found that increase in liquid flow rate results in higher values of mean diameter of +drop track. Increase in working pressure or working speed cause decrease in +drop <b>tracks</b> <b>size</b> and reduce merging of drops on spray surface. Increase in wear degree was followed by increased coverage rate. This phenomenon is especially dangerous when using nozzles with considerable wear degree for agricultural spray since this poses ecological threat to environment...|$|R

40|$|A lepton {{collider}} in the multi-TeV range has {{the potential}} to measure the trilinear Higgs self-coupling constant λ_hhh via the W-fusion mode ℓ^+ℓ^- →ν_ℓν̅_ℓ h h. In this paper we do a generator-level study to explore how center-of-mass energy spread, cone <b>size,</b> <b>tracking</b> resolution, and collision energy range affect how precisely a muon collider can measure λ_hhh in comparison to an e^+e^- collider. The smaller spread in center-of-mass energy and higher energy range of a muon collider improve cross section while the larger cone required to reduce beam-induced background hinders detection of double-Higgs events. Our results motivate a more detailed study of a multi-TeV muon collider and innovative detector and analysis technologies required for background rejection and precision measurement.
