[...] Accordingly, the court set aside the second and third rezoning refusals as they did not comply with the law. The court ordered the municipality to reconsider the congregation's application. The congregation had argued that such as a remedy was inadequate because it argued that the municipality was likely to again refuse the application, though with proper reasons. However, the court rejected this argument because it implies that the congregation was entitled to a particular <b>substantive</b> <b>decision,</b> instead of merely to a fair process. Additionally, the court was unable to conclude on the facts whether or not the municipality was acting in bad faith in denying the congregation's second and third rezoning applications.|$|E

Another issue is that women are employed as mere helpers without any <b>substantive</b> <b>decision</b> making power within rural farming families, rather than entrepreneurs who {{should have access to}} credit. Legislation and local customs hinder women's access to and control of assets that can be deemed as collateral such as land or livestock, by lending institutions. It is less likely for a women to own land, even if their families own it, and they are also less likely to control land, even if they formally own it. [...] Moreover, since there is bias in control over assets, livestock which is of a high-value is usually owned by men, whereas women mostly own low-value animals such as poultry. Such a system works against women as it offers lower security through their low-value livestock, and proves to be a serious hindrance for women to access credit due to lack of security.

40|$|Arguing {{from the}} premise that {{personal}} injury plaintiffs and injury evidence do not taint proceedings by encouraging jurors to adjudicate based on emotion rather than evidence, this article reviews and challenges judicial attempts to constrain jurors 2 ̆ 7 emotive responses to an injured plaintiff in three areas of personal injury litigation: voir dire, admissibility of evidence, and restrictions on damages arguments and assessment. The judicial abhorrence of sympathy {{as a ground for}} <b>substantive</b> <b>decision</b> making during some phases of the trial clashes with judicial tolerance of the emotion during others, giving rise to a pattern of sympathy in, sympathy out where the propriety of empathic identification decreases as the trial action builds to a stage requiring jury deliberation. Numerous judicial constraints upon emotive identification prove to be unnatural or unworkable because they are grounded in a shallow understanding of emotion and its interpersonal propriety that directly contradicts the role of emotion in lay interpersonal relations. Yet, at the same time lay patterns of emotive response are brought into the adjudicative mix by the jury trial model, which relies upon the judgment of lay jurors who are asked to abandon their socio-cultural understandings of emotional response for a substitute logic of emotive form and content that directly contradicts their pre-existing lay socio-cultural practices. Moreover, although jurors are told that evidence, not empathy, is the proper basis for <b>substantive</b> <b>decision</b> making, the personal injury trial is framed within a lay conception of emotive identification. Jurors are picked {{on the basis of their}} potential to identify with the plaintiff, and asked to rely upon life experiences in adjudicating the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s claim.

40|$|Legislative {{avoidance}} of principled decisions on substantive questions, by transferring {{the decision making}} task to the executive branch, is a frequent scenario. The legislature does this by way of either express, or hidden delegation, i. e. by using ambiguous wording that {{on the face of}} it only requires interpretation, but which in fact requires a <b>substantive</b> <b>decision</b> on the matter at stake. The Israeli legislature resorted to the hidden delegation tactic in order to avoid the adoption of a <b>substantive</b> <b>decision</b> in the dispute over the question of: “who is a Jew” - a dispute that has divided Israeli society and World Jewry (especially its American component) since the establishment of the State of Israel. This article presents a complex analysis of the Israeli Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of this hidden delegation. The aim of the article is to enhance the American reader’s understanding of the various options available to the court while tackling the fundamental question of the Nondelegation Doctrine, and to offer a few new insights as to how this question should be resolved. As is well known, during the last few decades, the American Supreme Court has avoided applying the Nondelegation doctrine, even though it has never been officially overruled. One of the stratagems employed by the American Supreme Court to avoid applying the doctrine is the strategy of denying the existence of delegation, in reliance on the “double test” established in the Chevron case. I will indicate the similarity between this evasion tactic and the tactics used by the majority justices of the Israeli Supreme Court in the matter of who is a Jew. I will then briefly review the arguments offered by the doctrine’s opponents, and present a new, narrower version of the doctrine, which distinguishes between express delegation and hidden delegation, and only seeks to disqualify the latter. I will argue that this version of the doctrine [...] which was employed in Israel by one minority Justice – could even be acceptable to those American justices and scholars who for various reasons oppose the doctrine in its complete form...|$|E

The workshop {{was part of a}} European research project studying the advantages and limitations of different participatory methods {{in the context of the}} Water Framework Directive. It involved policy makers, scientists, business representatives, and citizens from different parts of the island. On the first day, participants worked to envision a sustainable development future for the island and its water resources. Discussion was inspired by four alternative water development scenarios prepared by the organizers. Participants' vision statements emphasized a diversified development path and balanced water solutions. On the second day, participants worked to plan the actions needed to realize their common vision. The SW turned out to be a good method to initiate a multipartner dialogue, to include new stakeholders in the water policy debate, and to a certain extent, to promote learning between participants. On the other hand, it did not appear well suited to resolve conflicts and aid decisions in the face of scientific complexity and uncertainty. SW seems to be a good method for the "upstream," preparatory, capacity-building tasks of a planning process but not for the production of <b>substantive</b> <b>decision</b> outputs such as consensual agreements or action plans.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the recent {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia in John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson will have an effect for State laws comparable to the effect the Engineers case had for Commonwealth laws. In each case the fundamental juridical status of the Australian constitutional order is changed. The implications of this for Australia-wide accruals of jurisdiction are discussed. It is often wrong to try to separate laws from the jurisdictions {{in which they are}} applied. So Pfeiffer's expansion of the juridical base of State laws ought to imply an expansion (ie accrual) of jurisdictions beyond their primary law area. This is of particular importance following the (partial) demise of the Australian cross-vesting scheme. The author {{argues that the}} scheme was misconceived as a co-operative scheme. Its true basis lay in Commonwealth co-ordination in a Commonwealth law area. The States did not federate to co-operate with the entity they created (Commonwealth); rather, they federated to give that entity power to co-ordinate certain matters (including jurisdictions). The common law as a law area is discussed, and two meanings of common law are identified: the ordinary common law (Pfeiffer's <b>substantive</b> <b>decision</b> about conflicts of laws in tort), and the underlying relations of law areas (Pfeiffer's implication).

At its heart, the analogy principally has been used to address the <b>substantive</b> <b>decision</b> making of judges. This Part will explain that there is more to the analogy than such a narrow decisional focus suggests. Part III builds on Part II.

It also explores how these non-decisional similarities can be useful in understanding the role of the judiciary in our constitutional system. Part IV of the Essay turns to the analogy as applied to decision making specifically. It is here that the debate has raged. Part IV argues that the analogy provides some important insight into the decisional role of judges. Part V returns to the broader theme of this symposium. It explains how the umpire analogy informs a consideration of the appropriate role of a judge in American constitutional democracy.

This collaborative research project explored family literacy participants ’ experiences in their program’s parent advisory council (PAC). The study shows that involvement in the PAC enhanced program effectiveness, increased learners ’ investment in the program, and fostered capacities that learners transferred to personal, educa-tional, and social domains.

Since staff members often maintain control over which decisions and changes learners can make, it is important to consider why particular decisions should be open or off-limits to student input and to commu-nicate this clearly to participants.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{challenges}} of evidence synthesis to inform healthcare decision making within public health. It encompasses both methodological advancement and practical application of existing synthesis methodology, using as an example - accidents prevention in children to illustrate application of the methods within a public health context. The thesis commences with a systematic review of NICE public health appraisals to identify the barriers to quantitative synthesis of evidence in public health. Then focusing on the prevention of unintentional poisonings in pre-school children, a series of network metaanalyses of the effectiveness evidence are conducted, demonstrating how complex synthesis methodology can be employed to help overcome some challenges of evidence synthesis in a identified in {{the review of the}} NICE public health appraisals. New synthesis methodology is then developed in which the standard network meta-analysis model is first extended to include a covariate for the baseline risk and then to a multiple outcome settings. Baseline risk is a proxy for unmeasured but important patient-level characteristics, which may be modifiers of the treatment effect in a meta-analysis. Thus adjusting for it can account for heterogeneity across different study populations and identify those more likely to benefit from the intervention. The multiple outcome models account for the dependency structure within the data which is important in a decision modelling context, as correlations between effect estimates on different outcomes may have implications for estimating the net benefit associated with treatment. Finally, a <b>substantive</b> <b>decision</b> analytic model is presented incorporating results from the network meta-analysis and application of the methodology developed to the poison prevention data. The analyses suggest that compared to usual care, more intensive home safety interventions are more effective in preventing medicinal poisonings in pre-school children but are unlikely to be cost-effective for the UK NHS unless policy makers are willing to pay upwards of £ 75, 000 for every QALY gained...|$|E
