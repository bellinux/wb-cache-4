40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} set of papers {{to come out of the}} portfolio of Regional Studies Association publications in recent years has concerned the exposure of the levels of hidden unemployment in many of the old industrial areas of Britain (see, for instance: 'Labour market adjustment in areas of chronic industrial decline: the case of the UK coalfields', Regional Studies 30 (7), 1997, 627 - 640). The authors of these papers, Christina Beatty and Stephen Fothergill, have generated a debate that has uncovered major implications for the way the regional problem is measured, perceived and tackled. Although these are important in terms of regional economic development strategies and policies, it remains to be seen how the failure to count the real levels of unemployment will impact on the review of regional policy Assisted Areas, the designation of European <b>Structural</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>areas</b> and the successful introduction of such initiatives as the New Deal and Welfare to Work. Underpinning and deepening the rigour of this approach to understanding the nature of the regional problem, in recent conferences of the Regional Studies Association Ross MacKay and others have been at the forefront of developing the intellectual treatment of this uniquely UK issue: the cataloguing of many of the long term unemployed as long term sick. In this issue of Debates and Reviews, Anne Green and John Sutherland build upon the work of Ross MacKay (in particular, his paper 'Work and non-work: a more difficult labour market', presented to the European Urban and Regional Research Network (EURRN) Regional Frontiers conference in Frankfurt Oder in September 1997) by considering a number of new dimensions of this area of research. Anne Green seeks to explore insights into unemployment and nonemployment in Europe using alternative measures, based on widely accepted definitions and data sets. In the second paper, John Sutherland reflects on the routes off the unemployment register in a particular but typical region. Together these contributions to the ongoing debate on the future of the welfare state and forms of state intervention raise significant questions for the range of policies and programmes currently being pursued in the UK. Given the ways and channels along which such approaches tend to be transferred within Europe, the relevance of the British treatment of those not in work within the state benefits system to the rest of the continent is pertinent. How the redundant miners of Poland or Germany, for example, are dealt with by their authorities may have profound implications for the balance of funding within and between countries in the European Union sphere. ...|$|R

The material is gathered from data found in state aid applications by enterprises located in industrially declining <b>areas</b> (European <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> Objective 2 <b>areas)</b> in the prefectures of Varsinais-Suomi and Päijät-Häme during 1995 - 96. The study focuses upon the characteristics of the applicant enterprises and the projects financed. It also includes performance measurements of different financing operations by the KTM. Furthermore, by building logistic regression models, it examines the factors that influence the KTM in deciding whether to finance or not a state aid application. Results indicate (a) that there are no clear differences between enterprises which receive aid and those which do not and (b) that each KTM office applies to some extent its own financing procedures. Recommendations based on this study include (1) the standardization of the selection methods of enterprises, (2) the better utilization of the databases, (3) the creation of a flexible and targeted system of state aid where final beneficiaries are clearly defined, (4) the creation of a follow-up system to measure and evaluate the impact of the state aid, (5) imposing restrictions as to how often the same enterprises can be granted aid and (6) the introduction of an alternative type of aid in the form of forgivable loans. process evaluation, business subsidies, EU <b>structural</b> <b>funds,</b> quantitative methods...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{and social}} {{cohesion}} between the EU Member States {{is one of}} the explicitly stated goals in the Treaty on European Union. The EU’s <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> {{as a part of the}} Union’s regional policies are a mechanism of conditional grants that provides co-financing for growth enhancing investments. Evidence on the effectiveness of the <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> is mixed. While Boldrin and Canova (2001) find no sign of a catch-up effect of regions receiving aid for the period of 1980 - 1996, Beugelsdijk and Eijffinger (2005) find a positive relationship between (lagged) <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> expenditure and GDP growth at the national level covering 1995 - 2001. De La Fuente (2002) points to the fact that the inclusion of conditioning variables might also play a crucial role for the results. Ederveen, deGroot and Nahuis (2002) find that <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> themselves have a negative impact on growth. However, the impact turns out to be significantly positive, when interacting variables measuring institutional quality are taken into account. Similarly, Esposti (2005) shows that additional policy measures (spending on CAP) can have significant counter-effects on the effectiveness of <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> expenditure. So far the federal structure of the EU Member States did not attract much attention when the effectiveness of the <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> is considered. Although the EU Commission requires the inclusion of regional authorities and stakeholders in the planning and implementation procedure of programs <b>funded</b> by <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds,</b> one should expect that the performance is better, where the sub-national authorities are more accustomed to pursuing economic policy and implementing programs. This should be the case in states with a higher degree of sub-national autonomy. Using panel-data for a sample of 13 EU Member States from 1960 - 1995 the effects of <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> on growth are analysed. Then a decentralization index by Stegarescu (2004) is introduced as an interacting variable in order to measure the degree of sub-national autonomy. This paper shows that increasing sub-national autonomy has a significantly positive impact on the effectiveness of the Union’s <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> expenditure. ...|$|R

(objective 3). The {{purpose of this study is}} to quantify the economic impacts of objective 1 interventions of the <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> for the period 2000 – 2006. The expenditures of the <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> for objective 2 and objective 3, the Cohesion Fund, the Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-accession (ISPA) and loans which are granted by the European Investment Bank (EIB) are not included in the analysis.
