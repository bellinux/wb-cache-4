5|$|In 1708, E. Hatton {{recorded}} the inscription below the clock as Ex hoc Momento pendat Eternitas in his New View of London {{and did not}} mention a figure above it. The date 1715 is shown on the clock-case in the 1717 volume of Vitruvius Britannicus, <b>so</b> <b>perhaps</b> indicates the clock had been replaced and the inscription changed to Sic transit gloria mundi as shown here.|$|E
5|$|In {{every other}} {{transaction}} of life no man's wits {{could be more}} regular than those of Smart, for this prevalence of one idea pertinaciously keeping the first place in his head had in no sense, except in what immediately related to itself, perverted his judgement at all; his opinions were unchanged as before, nor did he seem more likely to fall {{into a state of}} distraction than any other man; less <b>so,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> as he calmed every violent start of passion by prayer.|$|E
5|$|Tatwine was a Mercian by birth. His {{epigraph}} at Canterbury {{stated that}} when he died he was in old age, <b>so</b> <b>perhaps</b> he was born around 670. He became a monk at the monastery at Breedon-on-the-Hill in the present-day County of Leicestershire, and then abbot of that house. Through the influence of King Æthelbald he was appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury in 731 and was consecrated on 10 June 731. He {{was one of a}} number of Mercians who were appointed to Canterbury during the 730s and 740s. Apart from his consecration of the Bishops of Lindsey and Selsey in 733, Tatwine's period as archbishop appears to have been uneventful. He died in office on 30 July 734. Later considered a saint, his feast day is 30 July.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, <b>so</b> <b>perhaps</b> avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E
25|$|In {{this sense}} Metzinger's L'Oiseau bleu was a {{precursor}} in its genre, more <b>so</b> <b>perhaps</b> than his Le goûter (Tea Time) of 1911, La Femme au Cheval, 1911–12, or Dancer in a café (Danseuse) of 1912.|$|E
25|$|This {{account is}} the one {{currently}} accepted, {{but it is not}} certain that it is true. The viceroy was known for his affairs, <b>so</b> <b>perhaps</b> his reputation alone generated the rumors. At least one medical paper (see the fourth reference below) claims to have found evidence that the viceroy died of a stroke, presumably in his palace.|$|E

60|$|The Signor Grimaldi frowned. But, {{ashamed to}} permit {{himself to be}} {{disturbed}} by an allusion <b>so</b> vague, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>so</b> unpremeditated, and more especially coming as it did from so insignificant a source, his brow regained its expression of habitual composure.|$|R

25|$|In {{fact the}} fossilised skin of Carnotaurus (an abelisaurid and {{therefore}} not a coelurosaur) shows an unfeathered, reptile-like skin with rows of bumps. But an adult Carnotaurus weighed about 1 ton, and mammals of this size and larger have either very short hair or naked skins, <b>so</b> <b>perhaps</b> the skin of Carnotaurus tells us nothing about whether smaller non-coelurosaurid theropods had feathers.|$|E
25|$|If {{the narrator}} narrates from a {{deceased}} scholar, inquiring when he, the narrator in question, was born, {{when he met}} that scholar and where and then comparing the dates provided in his response to the recognized dates of that scholars death and travels. <b>So,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> the dates provided by the narrator may contradict the established dates, for example, claiming that he heard from a particular scholar after the recognized death of that scholar.|$|E
25|$|Suppiluliuma then recounts how {{the land}} of Ishuwa on the upper Euphrates had seceded {{in the time of}} his grandfather. Attempts to conquer it had failed. In the time of his father, other cities had rebelled. Suppiluliuma claims to have {{defeated}} them, but the survivors had fled to the territory of Ishuwa, that must have been part of Mitanni. A clause to return fugitives is part of many treaties between sovereign states and between rulers and vassal states, <b>so</b> <b>perhaps</b> the harbouring of fugitives by Ishuwa formed the pretext for the Hittite invasion.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps the Fermi paradox itself—or {{the alien}} {{equivalent}} of it—is {{the reason for}} any civilization to avoid contact with other civilizations, even if no other obstacles existed. From any one civilization's point of view, it would be unlikely {{for them to be}} the first ones to make first contact. Therefore, according to this reasoning, it is likely that previous civilizations faced fatal problems with first contact and doing so should be avoided. <b>So</b> <b>perhaps</b> every civilization keeps quiet because of the possibility that there is a real reason for others to do so.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} {{does not}} mention a third road wheel to fix the turning radius, {{but it is possible}} that such a wheel was present. No gears would have been attached to it, <b>so</b> <b>perhaps</b> the author of the description did not mention it because he did not realize that it was {{an important part of the}} mechanism. Putting such a wheel on the chariot and making it function properly would not have been difficult. It might have been attached to the pole to which the horses were harnessed. Stops would have been provided to limit the motions of the pole to left and right.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{given the}} factions and jealousies {{that arise in}} any court and that Hephaestion was supremely close to the {{greatest}} monarch the western world had yet seen, it is remarkable how little enmity he inspired. Arrian mentions a quarrel with Alexander's secretary Eumenes but, because of a missing page in the text, {{the greater part of}} the detail is missing, leaving only the conclusion that something persuaded Hephaestion, though against his will, to make up the quarrel. However, Plutarch, who wrote about Eumenes in his series of Parallel Lives, mentions that it was about lodgings and a flute-player, <b>so</b> <b>perhaps</b> this was an instance of some deeper antagonism breaking out into a quarrel over a triviality. What that antagonism might have been, {{it is not possible to}} know, but someone with the closeness to the king of a secretary might well have felt some jealousy for Hephaestion's even greater closeness.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{argue that}} Fairtrade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on {{increasing}} yields and quality. Economists state that, {{if this is}} indeed so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, <b>so</b> <b>perhaps</b> a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The Fairtrade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.|$|E
25|$|Since the cricket bat is {{wide and}} flat, while the {{baseball}} bat is narrow and round, {{on the whole}} cricket batsmen {{find it easier to}} hit and direct the ball than baseball batters, resulting in many more runs being scored in a cricket match. While bowlers can influence the ability of the batsmen to do <b>so,</b> <b>perhaps</b> the most famous episode being the Bodyline tactic, cricket batsmen can use a wider variety of batting strokes to direct the ball in many directions into a field which provides much more open space than in baseball. Keeping in mind, cricket batsmen are under no obligation to attempt to score a run after any stroke, but must strike balls to prevent them from hitting the wicket. Many strokes are in fact defensive in nature against a well-bowled ball and the quality of defensive batting is often the determining factor of a batsman's success over his career, especially in the longer forms of the game.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon's defeat {{was also}} {{somewhat}} mirrored by Hitler's failed invasion of Russia during World War II in 1941. Although, ironically, Hitler had studied Napoleon's battle tactics, he decided, against {{the advice of}} many of his top advisers, to invade Russia and break his pact with Stalin. He knew the invasion would have only one chance and if he failed, he would be fighting a war on two fronts (the Western Front consisting of the Western Allies and the Eastern Front which would consist of the Soviet Union) which also proved fatal in Napoleon's situation. In 1812, Napoleon had been campaigning in Spain as well as Russia and had failed in both. In 1941, Hitler had to split his army in order to conquer Russia and in doing <b>so,</b> <b>perhaps</b> lost the war solely on that point. After Stalin found out what had happened, he orchestrated the Battle of Moscow which, along with the notoriously cold Russian winter, stopped the German troops and finally pushed them back. Hitler would now be fighting on two fronts.|$|E

500|$|Davidson further {{compares to}} early {{attestations}} of the Irish goddesses Badb (Davidson {{points to the}} description of Badb from The Destruction of Da Choca's Hostel where Badb is wearing a dusky mantle, has a large mouth, is dark in color, and has gray hair falling over her shoulders, or, alternatively, [...] "as a red figure {{on the edge of}} the ford, washing the chariot of a king doomed to die") and The Morrígan.
