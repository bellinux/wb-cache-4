It has been suggested that, whilst Somerset might have been targeted by York, the latter too might have been intentionally slain by the Neville brothers. It was John who, after the battle, appears to have been responsible for the victorious Duke of York removing Sir William Skipwith from the household offices the latter held of the Duke.

Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.|$|E
40|$|Title: Business <b>Share</b> <b>in</b> Joint Ownership of Multiple Individuals The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse a {{business}} <b>share</b> <b>in</b> joint ownership of multiple individuals. This paper {{is composed of}} four parts, each of them dealing with a different variation of the business <b>share</b> <b>in</b> joint ownership. The first part of this work is concerned with a legal interpretation of Section 114 paragraph 3 of the Commercial Code which, inter alia, sets forth that one business share may be held by more than one person. It introduces basic terminology that will be used throughout the work. It concludes that there are three variations of the business <b>share</b> <b>in</b> joint ownership. The first of them is the business <b>share</b> <b>in</b> co-ownership under Section 114 paragraph 3 of the Commercial Code (joint business <b>share</b> <b>in</b> the stricter sense); the second is the business <b>share</b> <b>in</b> matrimonial (community) property pursuant to Section 143 paragraph 2 of the Civil Code; and the third is the business <b>share</b> <b>in</b> matrimonial (community) property under Section 114 paragraph 3 of the Commercial Code (joint business <b>share</b> <b>in</b> the broader sense). The second part deals with the joint business <b>share</b> <b>in</b> the stricter sense.
