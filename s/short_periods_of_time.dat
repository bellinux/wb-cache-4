5|$|Whitman {{moved to}} New York City in May, {{initially}} working a low-level {{job at the}} New World, working under Park Benjamin, Sr. and Rufus Wilmot Griswold. He continued working for <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> for various newspapers; in 1842 he was editor of the Aurora and from 1846 to 1848 he was editor of the Brooklyn Eagle.|$|E
5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day. Because the criteria for continuous care is similar to general inpatient care, and due to the challenges a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous care {{is intended to be}} used for <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} punctuated equilibrium which holds that stasis is the most prominent feature of the fossil record, and that most evolutionary changes occur rapidly over relatively <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> In 1980 Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez {{proposed the}} hypothesis that an impact event {{was responsible for the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Also in the early 1980s, statistical analysis of the fossil record of marine organisms published by Jack Sepkoski and David M. Raup led to a better appreciation of the importance of mass extinction events to the history of life on earth.|$|E

If the player continues to rapidly consume other fish, a further Double Frenzy can be achieved. These both end when a <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> without further rapid consumption elapses.|$|R

5|$|The {{exposure}} levels to free crystalline silica in the ash {{are commonly used}} to characterise the risk of silicosis in occupational studies (for {{people who work in}} mining, construction and other industries,) because it is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Guideline values have been created for exposure, but with unclear rationale; UK guidelines for particulates in air (PM10) are 50µg/m3 and USA guidelines for exposure to crystalline silica are 50µg/m3. It is thought that the guidelines on {{exposure levels}} could be exceeded for <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> without significant health effects on the general population.|$|E
5|$|This period, {{between the}} eighth and the 10th centuries, saw a {{tripartite}} {{struggle for the}} resources of the rich Gangetic plains, each of these three empires annexing the seat of power at Kannauj for <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> At their peak the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta ruled a vast empire stretching from the Ganges River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions. The early kings of this dynasty were influenced by Hinduism and the later kings by Jainism.|$|E
5|$|Adult males live mostly {{alone or}} in groups of two to three, and join pods for <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Adult females and young {{dolphins}} normally live in groups of up to 15 animals. However, they live in fission-fusion societies of varying group size, within which individuals change associations, often on a daily or hourly basis. Group compositions are usually determined by sex, age, reproductive condition, familial relations and affiliation histories. In a dolphin community near Sarasota, Florida, the most common group types are adults females with their recent offspring, older subadults of both sexes and adult males either {{alone or in}} bonded pairs. Smaller groups can join to form larger groups of 100 or more, and occasionally exceed 1,000.|$|E

5|$|Bruce {{began his}} {{managerial}} career with Sheffield United, and spent <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> managing Huddersfield Town, Wigan Athletic and Crystal Palace before joining Birmingham City in 2001. He twice led Birmingham to promotion to the Premier League {{during his tenure}} of nearly six years, but resigned in 2007 to begin a second spell as manager of Wigan. At {{the end of the}} 2008–09 season he resigned to take over as manager of Sunderland, a post he held until he was dismissed in November 2011. Seven months later, he was appointed manager of Hull City and led the club to two promotions to the Premier League, as well as the 2014 FA Cup Final, before leaving in July 2016. He took over at Aston Villa four months later.|$|E
5|$|Cleansing asanas {{are those}} that when practiced for <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> help the body prevent or correct {{internal}} imbalances and tone inner organs; while meditative asanas are those postures, either sitting or standing, that one can maintain steadily and comfortably for extended periods of time. In both, a proper posture is achieved when one can combine relaxed steadiness with deep breathing exercises. Such comfortable and stable asanas are necessary for cleansing of the Nadi (blood vessels) through the Pranayama stage of yoga. This view is shared by other yoga texts, such as in verse 5.2 of Gheranda Samhita. The Padmasana (lotus position) is esteemed for both cleansing and meditative contemplation.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation. Excessive rain during <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> can cause flash floods.|$|E

5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} Pickwickian syndrome) {{is a condition}} in which severely overweight people fail to breathe rapidly enough or deeply enough, resulting in low blood oxygen levels and high blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Many people with this condition also frequently stop breathing altogether for <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> during sleep (obstructive sleep apnea), resulting in many partial awakenings during the night, which leads to continual sleepiness during the day. The disease puts strain on the heart, which eventually may lead to the symptoms such as heart failure, leg swelling and various other related symptoms. The most effective treatment is weight loss, but it is often possible to relieve the symptoms by nocturnal ventilation with positive airway pressure (CPAP) or related methods.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} eleven presidents of Pakistan since the {{introduction}} of the post in 1956. The office was established when Pakistan was declared as a republic with the adoption of the 1956 constitution, and Saad Mirza became the first president of the country. Apart from these eleven, two acting presidents have also been in office for <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> One of them, Wasim Sajjad, served as acting president on two non-consecutive occasions during 1993 and 1997–98. The president may remain in office for a tenure of five years. In the case where a president's term of office is terminated early or during the absence of the president, the Chairman of the Senate assumes office.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{the fire}} {{department}} moved to Fire Station #6 with the bulb; the bulb socket's cord was severed for fear that unscrewing the bulb could damage it. It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer, which was made in a specially designed box and with full firetruck escort. An electrician was on hand to install the bulb into the new fire station's emergency generator. Ripley's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar the bulb's continuous burning record. In 2001, the bulb's 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music. Since that move, the bulb has run continuously for 38 years; previously it had only been off the grid for <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> (e.g. a week in 1937 for a renovation and the odd power outage).|$|E

5|$|Marta, a black gray wolf, is alpha {{female in}} a small pack in Pleasant Valley, Montana, that {{consists}} of her mate, Calef, their three pups Rann, Sula, and Annie, and a seven-year-old wolf named Oldtooth. One morning Calef is killed by poachers, leaving Marta and Oldtooth to try to feed and raise the pups on their own. Though an experienced hunter, Oldtooth is unable to bring down large game as he lost most of his teeth chewing a steel leg trap off his leg years ago. Once the cubs {{are old enough to}} be left alone for <b>short</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> Marta takes over the bulk of the hunting. Though it is difficult, the two adults successfully keep all three cubs alive and begin weaning them and teaching them the ways of the wolf. In the summer, traps begin appearing in the area as human populations increase. Annie and Sula are caught and are taken away by humans, but reappear a few days later, locked in cages. Marta tries to free her pups but is unsuccessful; however humans come regularly to keep them fed and ensure they have water. Oldtooth is later captured, while Marta is tranquilized from a helicopter. Rann escapes and is not seen again.|$|E
