60|$|Some {{months after}} I had started {{shooting}} I {{began to have}} trouble with my beloved gun, owing to a weakness it had developed in its lock--one of the infirmities incidental to age which the gunsmiths of Buenos Ayres {{were never able to}} cure effectually. Whenever it got bad I was permitted to put it into the cart sent to town periodically, to have it repaired, and would then go gunless for a week or ten days. On one of these occasions I one day saw a party of <b>shoveller</b> <b>duck</b> dibbling in a small rain-pool {{at the side of the}} plantation, within a dozen yards of the old moat which surrounded it. Ducks always appeared to be exceptionally tame and bold when I was without a gun, but the boldness of those shovellers was more than I could stand, and running to the house I got out the old blunderbuss, which I had never been forbidden to use, since no one had ever thought it possible that I should want to use such a monster of a gun. But I was desperate, and loading it for the first (and last) time, I went after those shovellers.|$|E
6000|$|My chief {{ambition}} was {{to shoot}} wild duck. My brother shot them in preference to anything else: {{they were so}} much esteemed {{and he was so}} much commended when he came in with a few in his bag that I looked on duck-shooting as the greatest thing I could go in for. Ducks were common enough with us and in great variety; I know not in what country more kinds are to be found. There were no fewer than five species of teal, the commonest a dark brown bird with black mottlings; another, very common, was pale grey, the plumage beautifully barred and pencilled with brown and black; then we had the blue-winged teal, a maroon-red duck which ranges from Patagonia to California; the ringed teal, with salmon-coloured breast and velvet-black collar; the Brazilian teal, a lovely olive-brown and velvet-black duck, with crimson beak and legs. There were two pintails, one of which was the most abundant species in the country; also a widgeon, a lake duck, a <b>shoveller</b> <b>duck,</b> with red plumage, grey head and neck, and blue wings; and two species of the long-legged whistling or tree duck. Another common species was the rosy-billed duck, now to be seen on ornamental waters in England; and occasionally we saw the wild Muscovy duck, called Royal duck by the natives, but it was a rare visitor so far south. We also had geese and swans: the upland geese from the Megellanic Straits that came to us in winter--that is to say, our winter from May to August. And there were two swans, the black-necked, which has black flesh and is unfit to eat, and the white or Coscoroba Swan, as good a table bird as there is in the world. And oddly enough this bird has been known to the natives as a [...] "goose" [...] since the discovery of America, and now after three centuries our scientific ornithologists have made the discovery that it is a link between the geese and swans, but is more goose than swan. It is a beautiful white bird, with bright red bill and legs, the wings tipped with black; and has a loud musical cry of three notes, the last prolonged note with a falling inflection.|$|E
5000|$|The Museum of Liverpool Life exhibit details six birds {{thought to}} have {{inspired}} the Liver bird.As well as the Golden Eagle and Cormorant, it lists the White-tailed Sea Eagle (emblem of the Earls of Derby) the Heron (for its resemblance to many later depictions of the Liver bird) the Spoonbill (from the Old English name, Lofflar, and pronounced [...] "Lever"), the <b>Shoveller</b> <b>Duck</b> (also previously called a Spoonbill, and therefore also called Lofflar/"Lever" [...] in past times) and the Manx Shearwater (commonly called the “Lyre”).|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the bird}} species spotted here in winter include greater flamingo, lesser flamingo, {{northern}} pintail, northern <b>shoveller</b> <b>ducks,</b> sandpipers, plovers, terns, gulls, osprey, painted stork, Asian openbill stork, glossy ibis, black-headed ibis, western reef egret, little egret, intermediate egret, great egret, greenshank, common redshank, spotted redshank, godwits, pied avocet, Eurasian curlew, spot-billed pelican, stints, peregrine falcon and common kestrel.|$|R
5000|$|Phillip Docton (1667-1743), whose {{parentage}} is unclear, {{the last}} in the male line of the Docton family of Docton, whose ledger stone survives in Hartland Church, formerly {{in a place of}} great honour within the communion rails. It is inscribed: [...] "A gentleman eminent for his strict honour and integrity". He married Elizabeth Herle (1680-1718), daughter of Nicholas Herle of Landue in Cornwall. The ledger stone displays the arms of Docton impaling Herle (Gules, a fess sable between three <b>shoveller</b> <b>ducks</b> proper).|$|R
60|$|My {{first attempt}} at duck-shooting was made at a pond not many minutes' walk from the house, where I found a pair of <b>shoveller</b> <b>ducks,</b> feeding in their usual way in the shallow water with head and neck immersed. Anxious not to fail in this first trial, I got down {{flat on the ground}} and crawled snake-fashion for a {{distance}} of fifty or sixty yards, until I was less than twenty yards from the birds, when I fired and killed one.|$|R
5000|$|The cap is {{decorated}} in repoussé with vegetal motifs, trumpet-spirals and bird heads, while the horns have [...] "boldly asymmetric" [...] engraved decoration including {{a human face}} and the single complete one terminates in a modelled bird head; {{it has been suggested}} that this represents specifically the head of a northern <b>shoveller</b> <b>duck.</b> This probably originally had coral eyes; the other horn lacks its tip. The cap has holes for the ears of the pony; the angle at which the cap is currently displayed, as in the photo here, is designed to show the decoration clearly, and corresponds to that the cap would have had with the horse bowing its head. The photos on the museum website show the normal angle when worn better, with the edges on the sides roughly parallel with the ground.|$|E

50|$|The Lakes are {{attracting}} {{increasing numbers}} of wildfowl during the winter, including mallard, Eurasian teal, northern <b>shoveller,</b> tufted <b>duck,</b> common pochard, gadwall and Eurasian wigeon. Eurasian oystercatcher have already bred and {{it is hoped that}} northern lapwing and common redshank will too.|$|R

50|$|Other birds {{recorded}} as sometimes occurring on the wetlands in relatively substantial numbers include black swans, Pacific black ducks, grey teals, Australian shelducks, Australasian <b>shovellers,</b> pink-eared <b>ducks,</b> hardheads, black-backed bitterns, Australian white ibises, hoary-headed grebes, Eurasian coots, sharp-tailed sandpipers, red-necked stints, marsh sandpipers, white-headed stilts, double-banded plovers, red-kneed dotterels, red-capped plovers and whiskered terns. Australian painted snipes {{have been recorded}} from Hird Swamp in the IBA.|$|R
50|$|The Ramsar-listed lakes, {{along with}} other nearby lakes have been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as a 384 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA) because they support over 1% of the world populations of Australian shelducks, chestnut teals and banded stilts and irregularly support over 1% of the world populations of freckled ducks, musk ducks, blue-billed ducks, black swans, Australasian <b>shovellers,</b> pink-eared <b>ducks,</b> hoary-headed grebes, straw-necked ibises, sharp-tailed sandpipers and white-headed stilts.|$|R
50|$|Currawinya National Park {{is part of}} {{the project}} to revive Australia's {{population}} of the bilby, which in the park is protected from dingos and cats. This part of Australia is generally dry and when flooded Lakes Wyara and Numalla are important habitats for birds, being home to 250,000 birds of 40 species including the rainbow bee-eater, Australasian <b>shoveller,</b> freckled <b>duck,</b> musk duck, black swan, silver gull, Australian pelican, great egret, and glossy ibis.|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} wading birds breed on the reserve, {{including}} oystercatcher, redshank, ringed plover, and little ringed plover. Significant numbers of golden plovers overwinter there. Ducks present in winter include {{significant numbers of}} pochard, <b>shoveller,</b> teal, tufted <b>duck</b> and wigeon.|$|R
5000|$|The lagoon and the {{adjacent}} marshes {{have been identified}} by BirdLife International as a 63 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA) because they regularly support over 1% of the world populations of black swans and pied oystercatchers. [...] Other waterbirds sometimes present on the lagoon in substantial numbers include Australian shelducks, chestnut teals, Australasian <b>shovellers,</b> musk <b>ducks,</b> black-faced and little pied cormorants, hoary-headed and great crested grebes, crested and Caspian terns, white-faced herons, masked lapwings, red-capped and double-banded plovers, and red-necked stints. It supports the largest flock of common greenshanks in Tasmania.|$|R
50|$|The Nath Sagar {{reservoir}} creates 30 {{island of}} various sizes in the shallow waters, with trees for roosting, this provides an ideal shelter for migratory birds. Close to the dam a bird sanctuary has been created which is home for many species of resident and migrant birds. Almost 200 species of birds {{can be found in}} this region, which includes more than 70 species of migratory birds. Out of these, 45 chief species are of international migration. Notable amongst migratory birds are cranes, flamingos, pintails, wigeons, <b>shovellers,</b> brahminy <b>ducks,</b> pochards, teals, godwits, shauces and glossy ibises.|$|R
5|$|The Bucklands Pool/Backwell Lake Local Nature Reserve, {{southeast}} of the town centre {{and close to the}} Nailsea and Backwell railway station, was constructed as a balancing pond in the mid-1970s, and has since become home to various wildfowl and dragonflies and a foraging area for bats. Bird species seen on the reserve include gadwall, <b>shoveller,</b> pochard, tufted <b>duck,</b> grey heron and mute swans.|$|R
50|$|Broadwater Lake {{is unusual}} in having {{a number of small}} islands. It is {{significant}} for its breeding wetland birds and over-wintering water birds. Wintering birds which are present in nationally important numbers are great crested grebes, cormorants, <b>shovellers</b> and tufted <b>ducks,</b> and the number of gadwalls is internationally significant. The River Colne is important for bats, particularly Daubentons. The area also has ancient woodland.|$|R
5|$|Wildlife abounds in the valley, {{particularly}} the water birds around {{the rivers and}} lakes, with Chew Valley Lake considered the third most important site in Britain for wintering wildfowl. In addition to the water birds including <b>ducks,</b> <b>shoveller</b> (Anas clypeata), gadwall (Anas strepera) and great crested grebes (Podiceps cristatus), {{a wide variety of}} other bird species can be seen. These range from small birds such as tits (Paridae) and wrens (Troglodytidae) to mistle thrush (Turdidae). Larger birds include woodpeckers (Picidae) and common buzzard (Buteo buteo).|$|R
50|$|Martnaham Loch is a SSSI for {{the western}} half of its area. The {{south-western}} end of the loch is bordered by mixed woodland. Martnaham has had some notable rarities recorded over the years, such as smew, ring-necked duck, black tern, lesser scaup and hobby. Autumn and winter feature visits from flocks of goldeneye, wigeon, pochard and teal. <b>Shoveller,</b> scaup, long-tailed <b>duck</b> and gadwall are commonly seen and glaucous, Iceland and Mediterranean gulls are occasional visitors. Greylag geese and whooper swans gather in the surrounding fields. Great crested and little grebe breed here. Oystercatcher, curlew, redshank, common sandpiper, whimbrel, ruff, green sandpiper, black-tailed godwit, wheatear and whinchat are regular visitors.|$|R
50|$|Studies of {{the effects}} of changes in the water level at the {{reservoir}} have resulted in the publishing of an ideal regime for such draw-downs to maximise the benefits to wildlife. As with many such studies, there are conflicting interests, since moulting ducks such as pochard, <b>shoveller</b> and tufted <b>duck</b> thrive in summers when the levels do not fluctuate much, whereas the larger draw-downs create better conditions for wading birds. The shallows are rejuvenated when a large draw-down occurs, and dabbling ducks such as teal are most numerous as the reservoir refills, while the population of diving ducks is at its largest a year after such a draw-down has occurred.|$|R
