Later he is grateful for the humanitarian assistance provided by the British but refuses an offer to defect to their army.|$|E

5|$|The {{shell of}} the object is so hard that even a boron nitride drill makes no impression, and when the attempt is made, {{vibrations}} cause severe distress in people around the object.

5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) {{the presence of a}} living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a <b>soldier</b> <b>is</b> not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E

5|$|Alien <b>Soldier</b> <b>is</b> a side-scrolling run and gun {{video game}} {{developed}} by Treasure {{and published by}} Sega for the Mega Drive. Retail copies were released in Japan and PAL territories while in North America it was only available exclusively via the Sega Channel cable service. The story follows a powerful being named Epsilon-Eagle, who after being nearly killed becomes determined to avenge his near death and save his planet. The character {{has a variety of}} weapons and moves that the player must master to complete the game. Many gameplay ideas are borrowed from Treasure's earlier Mega Drive release, Gunstar Heroes (1993). However, Alien Soldier puts an emphasis on challenging boss fights with short and easy levels serving as downtime in-between.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, Chief of Staff Brigadier General Dahir Adan Elmi {{announced}} that Somalia's Ministry of Defence began holding military training {{inside the country}} for the first time, with Somali instructors now teaching courses to units that joined the armed forces. He also indicated that SNA leaders had created new numbered units for the army, and that the soldiers were slated to have their respective name and unit placed on their uniform. Additionally, Elmi stated that the military had implemented a new biometric registration system, wherein each recently trained and armed <b>soldier</b> <b>is</b> photographed and fingerprinted. By the end of 2014, 17,000 national army soldiers and police officers had registered for the new biometric remuneration system. 13,829 SNA soldiers and 5,134 Somali Police Force officials were biometrically registered in the system as of May 2015.|$|E
5|$|The main {{literary}} {{sources for}} the 4th-century army are the Res Gestae (History) of Ammianus Marcellinus, whose surviving books cover the period 353 to 378. Marcellinus, himself a veteran <b>soldier,</b> <b>is</b> regarded by scholars as a reliable and valuable source. But he largely fails {{to remedy the deficiencies}} of the Notitia as regards army and unit strength or units in existence, as he is rarely specific about either. The third major source for the late army is the corpus of imperial decrees published in the East Roman empire in the 5th and 6th centuries: the Theodosian code (438) and the Corpus Iuris Civilis (528–39). These compilations of Roman laws dating from the 4th century contain numerous imperial decrees relating to all aspects of the regulation and administration of the late army.|$|E

5|$|The {{minimum age}} is 16 (after {{the end of}} GCSEs), {{although}} soldiers under 18 may not serve in operations. The maximum recruitment age was raised in January 2007 from 26 to 33years, and the maximum age for Army Reserve soldiers is higher. A soldier would traditionally enlist for a term of 22 years, although recently {{there has been a}} shift towards 12-year terms with a 22-year option. A <b>soldier</b> <b>is</b> not normally permitted to leave until they have served for at least four years, and must give 12 months' notice.|$|E
5|$|The {{premise of}} Alien <b>Soldier</b> <b>is</b> {{provided}} with a long text scroll {{at the start of}} the game. After the game has begun, it is not referred to again. In the year 2015, the A-Humans of A-Earth have created genetically engineered A-Humans capable of super intelligence and strength, as well as parasitic co-existence with machinery and animals, particularly humans. A terrorist organization known as Scarlet rose up within this race and sought to dominate the rest of the A-Humans and A-Earth by locking the planet down and keeping anyone else out. During the height of Scarlet's power, an assassination attempt on the group's leader, Epsilon-Eagle, was carried out by a special forces group. Scarlet fought back with their powers, and the battle somehow breached the space-time continuum. Epsilon was gravely injured and cast somewhere into the continuum.|$|E
5|$|The twin pylons rise to {{a height}} 30metres above the memorial's stone platform; one bears the maple leaf for Canada and the other the fleur-de-lis for France, and both symbolize the unity and {{sacrifice}} of the two countries. At {{the top of the}} pylons is a grouping of figures known collectively as the Chorus. The most senior figures represent Justice and Peace; Peace stands with a torch upraised, making it the highest point in the region. The pair is in a style similar to Allward's previously commissioned statues of Truth and Justice, located outside the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa. The remainder of the Chorus is located directly below the senior figures: Faith, Hope and Truth on the eastern pylon; and Honour, Charity and Knowledge on the western pylon. Around these figures are shields of Canada, Britain, and France. Large crosses adorn the outside of each pylon. The First World War battle honours of the Canadian regiments, and a dedicatory message to Canada's war dead in both French and English are located {{at the base of the}} pylons. The Spirit of Sacrifice is located at the base between the two pylons. In the display, a young dying <b>soldier</b> <b>is</b> gazing upward in a crucifixion-like pose, having thrown his torch to a comrade who holds it aloft behind him. In a lightly veiled reference to the poem In Flanders Fields by John McCrae, the torch is passed from one comrade to another in an effort to keep alive the memory of the war dead.|$|E
