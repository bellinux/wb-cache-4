5|$|On January 2, 2014, the Phillies and Comcast Sportsnet {{announced}} a 25-year, $2.5billion TV contract; although it averaged $100million a year, it was structured to begin below the average and end above it.

Although the remaining Phillies announcers were disappointed with the decision, they all returned for the season.

Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the <b>stairs</b> and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining <b>stairs</b> and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies.

40|$|Objective To examine using surface {{electromyography}} whether <b>stair</b> climbing with abdominal hollowing (AH) {{is better}} at facilitating local trunk muscle activity than <b>stair</b> climbing without AH. Methods Twenty healthy men with {{no history of}} low back pain participated in the study. Surface electrodes were attached to the multifidus (MF), lumbar erector spinae, thoracic erector spinae, transverse abdominus- internal oblique abdominals (TrA-IO), external oblique abdominals (EO), and the rectus abdominis. Amplitudes of electromyographic signals were measured during <b>stair</b> climbing. Study participants performed maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) for each muscle in various positions to normalize the surface electromyography data. Results AH during <b>stair</b> climbing resulted in significant increases in normalized MVCs in both MFs and TrA-IOs (p< 0. 05). Local trunk muscle/global trunk muscle ratios were higher during <b>stair</b> climbing with AH as compared with <b>stair</b> climbing without AH. Especially, right TrA-IO/EO and left TrA-IO/EO were significantly increased (p< 0. 05). Conclusion <b>Stair</b> climbing with AH activates local trunk stabilizing muscles better than <b>stair</b> climbing without AH. The findings suggest that AH during <b>stair</b> climbing contributes to trunk muscle activation and trunk stabilization...|$|R

40|$|<b>Stair</b> {{climbing}} is {{an ideal}} activity to promote in worksites due to its availability and associated health benefits. To date findings are equivocal regarding <b>stair</b> climbing intervention success in this setting, thus more research is needed. Chapter two of this thesis confirmed that a calorific expenditure message can increase <b>stair</b> climbing in a train station. Based on this finding, chapter three implemented a point-of-choice intervention using a longer calorific expenditure message in four buildings and successfully increased <b>stair</b> climbing. The inability to translate intervention success on public access staircases to the worksite setting {{is likely to be}} due the random availability of the lift. Consequently, chapter four examined the effect of lift availability on <b>stair</b> use, concluding that reduced lift availability increases <b>stair</b> use. Lift availability can rarely be modified however, so chapter five assessed whether a point-of-choice intervention using an aspirational climb Mt. Everest message can increase <b>stair</b> climbing. Whilst no increase in <b>stair</b> climbing was recorded during this intervention, the same calorific expenditure message as used in chapter three increased <b>stair</b> climbing in the same building. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the effectiveness of point-of-choice prompts using calorific expenditure messages in increasing <b>stair</b> climbing in the worksite setting.
