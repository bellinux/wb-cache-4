25|$|In 1973, Charlton debuted the Gothic romance title Haunted Love, {{but this}} same period saw the mass {{cancellation}} {{of almost all}} of Charlton's vast stable of traditional romance titles, including such long-running series as Sweethearts, Romantic Secrets, Romantic <b>Story,</b> <b>I</b> Love You, Teen-Age Love, Just Married, and Teen Confessions, all of which dated from the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|Larry Parks wrote, in a {{personal}} tribute to Jolson:Stepping into his shoes was, for me, a matter of endless study, observation, energetic concentration to obtain, perfectly if possible, a simulation {{of the kind of}} man he was.

25|$|Louisa Hamer, (Plaintiff), brought {{suit against}} Franklin Sidway, the {{executor}} {{of the estate}} of William E. <b>Story</b> <b>I,</b> (Defendant), for the sum of $5,000. On March 20, 1869, William E. Story had promised his nephew, William E. Story II, $5,000 if his nephew would abstain from drinking alcohol, using tobacco, swearing, and playing cards or billiards for money until the nephew reached 21 years of age. Story II accepted the promise of his uncle and did refrain from the prohibited acts until he turned the agreed-upon age of 21. After celebrating his 21st birthday on January 31, 1875, Story II wrote to his uncle and requested the promised $5,000. The uncle responded to his nephew in a letter dated February 6, 1875 in which he told his nephew that he would fulfill his promise. <b>Story</b> <b>I</b> also stated that he would prefer to wait until his nephew was older before actually handing over the (then) extremely large sum of money (according to an online inflation calculator, $5000 in 1890 would be worth approximately $130,000 in 2017). The elder Story also declared in his letter that the money owed to his nephew would accrue interest while he held it on his nephew's behalf. The younger Story consented to his uncle's wishes and agreed that the money would remain with his uncle until Story II became older. William E. <b>Story</b> <b>I</b> died on January 29, 1887 without having transferred any of the money owed to his nephew. Story II had meanwhile transferred the $5,000 financial interest to his wife; Story II's wife had later transferred this financial interest to Louisa Hamer on assignment. The elder Story's estate refused to grant Hamer the money, believing there was no binding contract {{due to a lack}} of consideration. As a result, Hamer sued the estate's executor, Franklin Sidway.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, I made {{a serious}} error in {{judgment}} and conducted {{myself in a}} way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the <b>story,</b> <b>I</b> used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E

25|$|In March 2011, Oz sent imprisoned former Tanzim leader Marwan Barghouti {{a copy of}} {{his book}} A Tale of Love and Darkness in Arabic {{translation}} with his personal dedication in Hebrew: “This story is our <b>story,</b> <b>I</b> hope you read it and understand us as we understand you, hoping to see you outside and in peace, yours, Amos Oz”. The gesture was criticized by members of rightist political parties, among them Likud MK Tzipi Hotovely. Assaf Harofeh Hospital canceled Oz's invitation to give the keynote speech at an awards ceremony for outstanding physicians in the wake of this incident.|$|E
25|$|Surely Bentley {{was right}} to be {{surprised}} at finding Faunus haunting the bower , a ghost crying in the cold of Paradise, and the lusts of Pan sacred even in comparison to Eden. There is a Vergilian quality in the lines, haunting indeed, a pathos not mentioned {{because it is the}} whole of the <b>story.</b> <b>I</b> suppose that in Satan determining to destroy the innocent happiness of Eden, for the highest political motives, without hatred, not without tears, we may find some echo of the Elizabethan fulness of life that Milton as a poet abandoned, and as a Puritan helped to destroy.|$|E
25|$|The {{murders and}} trial—"the biggest <b>story</b> <b>I</b> have ever seen", said the {{producer}} of NBC's Today—received extensive media coverage from the very beginning; at least one instant book was proposed two hours after the bodies were found, and scheduled to publish {{only a few weeks}} later. The Los Angeles Times covered the case on its front page for more than 300 days after the murders. The Big Three television networks' nightly news broadcasts gave more air time to the case than to the Bosnian War and the Oklahoma City bombing combined. The media outlets served an enthusiastic audience; one company put the loss of national productivity from employees following the case instead of working at $40billion. The Tonight Show with Jay Leno aired many skits on the trial, and the Dancing Itos—a troupe of dancers dressed as the judge—was a popular recurring segment.|$|E

500|$|... what is {{interesting}} about this film, perhaps, is the moment when it was made.

And {{it seemed to me that}} a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous <b>story.</b> <b>I</b> looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E

We were protecting our children -- the cars in the large empty lot we were running around -- from the aliens." [...] 1UP.com's Patrick Klepek said, [...] "Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem fails to capitalize on its gaming heritage, instead falling prey to the same substandard licensed schlock we're used to from the films." ...|$|E
