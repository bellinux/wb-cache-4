40|$|The {{structure}} comprises {{a support}} which is fitted underneath the bath tray {{so that only}} the top rim of the bath rests on the support, leaving an in between gap between support and bath. A <b>sound-absorbent</b> <b>material</b> is arranged so as to fill that gap. In the event that plastic or thin steel baths are used, spacer-pieces are positioned between {{the bottom of the}} bath and the support. The gap between the bath and support is kept as large as possible so that the <b>sound-absorbent</b> <b>material</b> not compressed when the bath is inserted. The sound-absorption material may consist of mineral or wood wool, foam or organic material and it may come in mat or panel form. It preferably encloses the whole of the bath's exterior. ADVANTAGE - Prevents noise from being transmitted from the bath to adjacent room areas...|$|E
40|$|Method {{measures}} acoustic {{properties of}} <b>sound-absorbent</b> <b>materials</b> and jet-nozzle system. Advantages of impulse method over other methods are that test time and complication are reduced. Results obtained from impulse method have been {{compared with those}} from existing methods, both experimental and theoretical, and show excellent agreement...|$|R
