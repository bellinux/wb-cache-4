40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of international legal framework on the pharmaceutical patent and <b>second</b> <b>medical</b> <b>use.</b> The provisions under the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights(“TRIPS”) Agreement generally focuses on the pharmaceutical patent {{in relation to the}} access to medicines and not specifically addressing issues on the medical innovation involving first and <b>second</b> <b>medical</b> <b>use.</b> Although Doha Declaration on the “TRIPS” Agreement and Public Health equally recognizes on the importance of medical innovation, the issue on medical innovation is not further analysed in relation to the <b>second</b> <b>medical</b> <b>use.</b> The provisions of the “TRIPS” Agreement open a flexible option to the member countries to exclude method of medical treatment from patentability. Although excluding method of medical treatment seems to be as a flexible option to countries to prevent evergreening patents, it further adds to the challenge of overlooking the importance of the <b>second</b> <b>medical</b> <b>use</b> type of patents. The author will also analyse another important international legal framework on the European Patent Convention (EPC) which emphasizes on the new uses of known substances. However, the Article 54 (5) of the EPC only impliedly recognizes first medical uses. The question on whether EPC recognizes <b>second</b> <b>medical</b> <b>use</b> is still ambiguous in the international legal framework not with standing its importance in the pharmaceutical and medical field...|$|E

40|$|The main Topic of this {{dissertation}} is to critically {{analyze the}} obligations of States’ parties to the TRIPS Agreement {{in relation to the}} extent of protection that they are bound to confer on first and <b>second</b> <b>medical</b> <b>use</b> patents. In this sense, the Viagra case illustrates the tensions between the national pharmaceutical industries of the States members of the Andean Community and a leading pharmaceutical company like Pfizer. The dissertation pretends to demonstrate that the decisions taken by the authorities in the Andean Region were consistent with the international minimum standards of IPRs as embodied in the TRIPS Agreement. The Viagra case is the most important series of administrative and judicial decisions concerning first and second use patents in the Andean region. It is composed of the administrative rulings of the member States national authorities of the Andean Community, by the administrative rulings of the Andean Community Secretariat and by the judicial decisions of the Andean Tribunal of Justice.  This case was elected as the topic of the dissertation because it doesn’t follow the international trend to expand the levels of patent protection, which has occurred in two ways. First, the scope of patentable subject- matter has been given an inclusive interpretation. Secondly, the restrictions on patentability have been narrowly interpreted.

Reintroduction of generic drugs by <b>second</b> <b>medical</b> <b>use</b> patents also contributes to cheaper and faster drug development processes. We screened, in silico, the Food and Drug Administration-approved generic drug database {{by means of the}} One-dimensional Drug Profile Matching (oDPM) method in order to find potential peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists. The PPARγ action of the selected generics was also investigated by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Materials and methods: The in silico oDPM method was used to determine the binding potency of 1, 255 generics to 149 proteins collected. In vitro PPARγ activation was determined by measuring fatty acid-binding protein 4 /adipocyte protein gene expression in a Mono Mac 6 cell line. The in vivo insulin sensitizing effect of the selected compound (nitazoxanide; 50 – 200 mg/kg/day over 8 days; n = 8) was established in type 2 diabetic rats by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamping. Results: After examining the closest neighbors of each of the reference set’s members and counting their most abundant neighbors, ten generic drugs were selected with oDPM. Among them, four enhanced fatty acid-binding protein/adipocyte protein gene expression in the Mono Mac 6 cell line, but only bromfenac and nitazoxanide showed dose-dependent actions. Induction by nitazoxanide was higher than by bromfenac. Nitazoxanide lowered fasting blood glucose levels and improved insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic rats. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the oDPM method can predict previously unknown therapeutic effects of generic drugs. Nitazoxanide can be the prototype chemical structure of the new generation of insulin sensitizers.

50|$|Searching {{for medical}} {{information}} on the Web is a challenging task for ordinary Internet users. Often, users are uncertain about their exact medical situations, are unfamiliar with medical terminology, and hence have difficulty in {{coming up with the}} right search keywords. An intelligent medical search engine is specifically designed to address this challenge. It uses several techniques to improve its usability and search result quality. First, it uses an interactive questionnaire-based query interface to guide users to provide the most important information about their situations. Users perform search by selecting symptoms and answering questions rather than by typing keyword queries. <b>Second,</b> it <b>uses</b> <b>medical</b> knowledge (e.g., diagnostic decision trees) to automatically form multiple queries from a user' answers to the questions. These queries are used to perform search simultaneously. Third, it provides various kinds of help functions. For instance, if a user has made incorrect selections, does not know which symptoms to select, or cannot answer a question, he or she can invoke the search engine's help functionality and describe his or her health situation there. Then he or she will see multiple lists of help information, e.g., one list for relevance of unselected symptoms, and another list for relevance of alternate responses (to his or her selections). The contents of those lists are ranked <b>using</b> <b>medical</b> knowledge and specially designed medical information retrieval techniques.|$|R
