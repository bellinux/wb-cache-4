5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is long. The nasal {{bones are}} short, with their back margin not {{extending}} beyond the lacrimal bones, {{which are in}} contact with both the maxillary and frontal bones. The zygomatic notch is moderately developed and the jugal bone is small, so that when seen from the side the maxillary and squamosal parts of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) overlap. Usually, the <b>suture</b> (<b>line</b> of fusion) between the frontal and the squamosal is continuous with that between the frontal and the parietal bone. In T.talamancae, the parietals usually extend {{from the roof of}} the braincase broadly on to the sides, but in T.bolivaris they are more commonly restricted to the roof.|$|E
25|$|Originating {{from within}} the bactritoid nautiloids, the ammonoid {{cephalopods}} {{first appeared in the}} Devonian (circa 400 million years ago) and became extinct {{at the close of the}} Cretaceous (66 Mya) along with the dinosaurs. The classification of ammonoids is based in part on the ornamentation and structure of the septa comprising their shells' gas chambers; by these and other characteristics we can divide subclass Ammonoidea into three orders and eight known suborders. While nearly all nautiloids show gently curving sutures, the ammonoid <b>suture</b> <b>line</b> (the intersection of the septum with the outer shell) is variably folded, forming saddles (or peaks) and lobes (or valleys).|$|E
500|$|Myxobolus cerebralis has a two-host {{life cycle}} {{involving}} a salmonid fish and a tubificid oligochaete. So far, the only worm {{known to be}} susceptible to M. cerebralis infection is Tubifex tubifex, though what scientists currently call T. tubifex {{may in fact be}} more than one species. [...] First, myxospores are ingested by tubificid worms. In the gut lumen of the worm, the spores extrude their polar capsules and attach to the gut epithelium by polar filaments. The shell valves then open along the <b>suture</b> <b>line</b> and the binucleate germ cell penetrates between the intestinal epithelial cells of the worm. This cell multiplies, producing many amoeboid cells by an asexual cell fission process called merogony. As a result of the multiplication process, the intercellular space of the epithelial cells in more than 10 neighbouring worm segments may become infected.|$|E

50|$|The holotype fossil has a flat to low spired shell with 6.25 whorls {{preserved}} and {{a diameter of}} 13.7 mm, though the adult whorls are not preserved. The spire is low, with the outer whorls being higher than the inner whorls, giving a sunken look to the shell center. Numerous fine <b>suture</b> <b>lines</b> curve across most of the shell, fading as the lines approach the keel. Each of the <b>suture</b> <b>lines</b> curve outward toward the aperture.|$|R
50|$|Caput succedaneum {{presents}} as a scalp swelling {{that extends}} across the midline and over <b>suture</b> <b>lines</b> and {{is associated with}} head molding. Caput succedaneum does not usually cause complications and usually resolves over the first few days.|$|R
2500|$|News of this {{groundbreaking}} {{story was}} circulated {{around the world}} by the Associated Press. Newsreels touted the event, greatly enhancing the status of Johns Hopkins and solidifying the reputation of Blalock, who had been regarded as a maverick up until that point by some in the Hopkins old guard. Thomas' contribution remained unacknowledged, both by Blalock and by Hopkins. Within a year, the operation known as the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt had been performed on more than 200 patients at Hopkins, with parents bringing their suffering children from thousands of miles away. Thomas's surgical techniques included one he developed in 1946 for improving circulation in patients whose great vessels (the aorta and the pulmonary artery) were transposed. A complex operation called an atrial septectomy, the procedure was executed so flawlessly by Thomas that Blalock, upon examining the nearly undetectable <b>suture</b> <b>line,</b> was prompted to remark, [...] "Vivien, this looks like something the Lord made". To the host of young surgeons Thomas trained during the 1940s, he became a figure of legend, the model of a dexterous and efficient cutting surgeon. [...] "Even if you'd never seen surgery before, you could do it because Vivien made it look so simple," [...] the renowned surgeon Denton Cooley told Washingtonian magazine in 1989. [...] "There wasn't a false move, not a wasted motion, when he operated." [...] Surgeons like Cooley, along with Alex Haller, Frank Spencer, Rowena Spencer, and others credited Thomas with teaching them the surgical technique that placed them at the forefront of medicine in the United States. Despite the deep respect Thomas was accorded by these surgeons and by the many black lab technicians he trained at Hopkins, he was not well paid. [...] He sometimes resorted to working as a bartender, often at Blalock's parties. This led to the peculiar circumstance of his serving drinks to people he had been teaching earlier in the day. Eventually, after negotiations on his behalf by Blalock, he became the highest paid technician at Johns Hopkins by 1946, and by far the highest paid African-American on the institution's rolls. Although Thomas never wrote or spoke publicly about his ongoing desire to return to college and obtain a medical degree, his widow, the late Clara Flanders Thomas, revealed in a 1987 interview with Washingtonian writer Katie McCabe that her husband had clung to the possibility of further education throughout the blue baby period and had only abandoned the idea with great reluctance. Mrs. Thomas stated that in 1947, Thomas had investigated the possibility of enrolling in college and pursuing his dream of becoming a doctor, but had been deterred by the inflexibility of Morgan State University, which refused to grant him credit for life experience and insisted that he fulfill the standard freshman requirements. Realizing that he would be 50 years old by the time he completed college and medical school, Thomas decided to give up the idea of further education.|$|E
50|$|When used in paleontology, suture {{can also}} refer to fossil exoskeletons, {{as in the}} <b>suture</b> <b>line,</b> a {{division}} on a trilobite between the free cheek and the fixed cheek; this <b>suture</b> <b>line</b> allowed the trilobite to perform ecdysis (the shedding of its skin).|$|E

5000|$|Stephanoceratoidea, {{formerly}} Stephanocerataceae, is a superfamily {{of middle}} Jurassic ammonoid cephalopods within the order Ammonitida containing diverse forms, generally with sharp ribbing and complex <b>suture</b> <b>lines.</b> Aptychi {{are believed to}} be mostly granular (Granulaptycus) or concentrially ribbed on the surface (Praestriaptychus) (Arkell et al. 1957) ...|$|R
50|$|The Notch of Rivinus {{is a small}} {{defect in}} the {{posterior}} edge of the bony annular tympanic ring. The defect is located just superior to the tympano-mastoid <b>suture</b> <b>line</b> in the posterior ear canal. Following identification of the spine of Henle {{it is possible to}} follow the tympano-mastoid <b>suture</b> <b>line</b> medially towards the annular ring. At this location the Chorda Tympani Nerve is often identified. Just superior to this the Notch of Rivinus can be seen and the neck of the malleus occupies the notch and often is the superior limit of a tympanomeatal flap.|$|E
5000|$|The genus name Papillifera means [...] "bearing papules", {{in other}} words having pimples, a {{reference}} to the small white shell structures along the <b>suture</b> <b>line.</b> The papules are very noticeable in the shells of individuals in this species.|$|E
50|$|These cephalopds, as {{the other}} species in the {{superfamily}} Psiloceratoidea, are usually characterized by mostly involute, oxyconic shells with narrow venter and compressed, lanceolate whorl section. The <b>suture</b> <b>line</b> is of ammonitic type. Ribbing is feeble, hardly functional and often absent.|$|E
5000|$|After a test {{series of}} over 300 patients, Dr. Barnett moved to St. Petersburg, Florida where {{he joined the}} staff of Palms of Pasadena Hospital, where he trained other {{surgeons}} to perform his continent intestinal reservoir procedure. With the assistance of Dr. James Pollack, the first BCIR Program was established. Both surgeons further enhanced the procedure {{to bring it to}} where it is today. These modifications included reconfiguring the pouch to decrease the number of <b>suture</b> <b>lines</b> from three to one (this allowed the pouch to heal faster and reduced the chance of developing fistulae); and creating a serosal patch over the <b>suture</b> <b>lines</b> which prevented leakage. [...] The end result of these developments has been a continent intestinal reservoir with minimal complications and satisfactory function.|$|R
40|$|The {{failure of}} reinnervation after cardiac {{transplantation}} {{is probably a}} consequence of scar formation at the <b>suture</b> <b>lines.</b> However, it must be established whether there are any intrinsic properties of the muscle that prevent reinnervation.

50|$|The vomer is a {{triangle}} shaped bone {{that forms the}} inferior and posterior portion of the nasal septum (www.emedicine.com/plastic/topic519.htm). A vomer flap {{is a type of}} palatoplasty surgery that uses the mucoperiosteal tissue of the vomer to cover a unilateral or bilateral cleft palate. This procedure can be used to reconstruct the nasal or oral surfaces by either raising the vomer or creating a flap. Surgical procedures can be combined according to type of clefting in order to ensure the best outcomes for the patient. Vomer flap surgery involves the <b>suture</b> <b>line</b> of the vomer bone which is an important site for midface growth. In this case, a <b>suture</b> <b>line</b> refers to boundary between two bony plates which eventually grow together as the child matures.|$|E
50|$|An {{inflammatory}} reaction {{can occur}} if a dermoid cyst is disrupted, and the cyst can recur {{if it is}} not completely excised. Sometimes complete excision is not practical if the cyst is in a dumbbell configuration, whereby it extends through a <b>suture</b> <b>line</b> in the skull.|$|E
50|$|Post {{operative}} bleeding {{can occur}} {{in the first few}} days after surgery. There may be moderate swelling anywhere from 1 to 5 days.

50|$|Genus {{is similar}} to Harpoceras, {{but it is more}} {{involute}} and its whorl section is more triangular. Greatest width is near umbilicus. Flat whorl sides are converging to a flat narrow venter. It has strong keel, but there might be also slight ventro-lateral keels. Falcoid ribs are strongly projecting near venter. <b>Suture</b> <b>line</b> is highly incised, ornate and has many auxiliary saddles.|$|E

50|$|Shells of Nannolytoceras species reach a {{diameter}} of about 46 - 75 mm. The shell is evolute, smooth, tubular to compressed, with a variable number of more or less regularly spaced deep constrictions. The very thin ribs crossing the ventral region are barely visible. Umbilicus is relatively large. The <b>suture</b> <b>line</b> is of ammonitic type. These cephalopods were fast-moving nektonic carnivores.|$|E

According to his observations, the abnormal cranial growth observed in persons with craniosynostosis occurs perpendicular to the involved calvarial sutures. Therefore, if a <b>suture</b> <b>line</b> is prematurely ossified, no growth is present in the direction perpendicular to that suture. Surgical treatment for craniosynostosis was initially advocated by Odilon Lannelongue in 1890.|$|E
