5|$|To {{the left}} of the 4th Grenadiers were the two squares of the 1st/ and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs who angled further to the west and had {{suffered}} more from artillery fire than the grenadiers. But as their advance mounted the ridge they found it apparently abandoned and covered with dead. Suddenly 1,500 British Foot Guards under Maitland who had been lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery rose and devastated them with point-blank volleys. The chasseurs deployed to answer the fire, but some 300 fell from the first volley, including Colonel Mallet and General Michel, and both battalion commanders. A bayonet charge by the Foot Guards then broke the leaderless squares, which fell back onto the following column. The 4th Chasseurs battalion, 800 strong, now came up onto the exposed battalions of British Foot Guards, who lost all cohesion and dashed back up the slope as a disorganized crowd with the chasseurs in pursuit. At the crest the chasseurs came upon the battery that had caused severe casualties on the 1st and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs. They opened fire and swept away the gunners. The left flank of their square now came under fire from a heavy formation of British skirmishers, which the chasseurs drove back. But the skirmishers were replaced by the 52nd Light Infantry, led by John Colborne, which wheeled in line onto the chasseurs' flank and poured a devastating fire into them. The chasseurs returned a very <b>sharp</b> <b>fire</b> which killed or wounded some 150 men of the 52nd. The 52nd then charged, and under this onslaught, the chasseurs broke.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Langen, {{observing the}} {{increased}} fury and obstinacy {{of the fight}} in Ligny, sent in the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment, and the 2nd of the 3rd Elbe Landwehr: he then took up a position, with {{the remainder of his}} brigade, near the Mill of Bussy, into which he threw the 2nd Battalion of the 23rd Regiment. The 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment, having formed two columns, rushed into the village, and, after crossing the stream, received a <b>sharp</b> <b>fire</b> from the windows of the houses on the opposite side. The left column of the battalion stormed a farm house, of which, after it had burst in the gates with hatchets, it gained possession, and thus protected the advance of the right column.|$|E
25|$|Sir Hugh Rose, on {{arriving}} at Poonch, sent Major Gall to the fort at Lohari. The fort and village of Lohari were situated in an extensive level plain. The fort itself was square and flanked by round towers at the corners. It had a ditch {{and a second}} line of works outside the ditch. A company of the 3rd Europeans crossed the open space between the village and fort without opposition and established themselves in a guard-house close to the ditch. The garrison of the fort paid no heed to the summons of surrender. Major Gall concluded that no option remained, after reconnaissance, but to open the third gate {{with a bag of}} gunpowder and carry the fort by storm. Twenty-five files of the 3rd Europeans, under Lieutenants Armstrong and Donne and Ensign Newport occupied the gateways as the storming party. Lieutenant Bonus, Bombay Engineers, under the cover of <b>sharp</b> <b>fire</b> from the 3rd Europeans, placed the powder-bag in front of the closed gate, and the firing party withdrew. The explosion occurred and the storming 3rd Europeans rushed in through the smoke and almost immediately met the enemy face to face. The stormers were assailed by a shower of stones and brickbats as well as by men who cut, stabbed and shot at them from the walls. Lieutenant Donne and Ensign Newport were severely wounded while fighting hand-to-hand, but beat off their assailants and retreated under bayonet protection. Lieutenant Rose now came opportunely to the front for a final charge and the 3rd Europeans, with some of the 25th Bombay Native Infantry, drove their foe before them and a bloody melee ensued. A last stand by the foe near the gateway was also crushed. The bugler private, Private Whirlpool, who made it through the gate first in the final charge, later received the Victoria Cross for his gallantry. The 3rd Bombay Europeans had a toll of 1 killed in action and 17 wounded.|$|E

60|$|On foot, from {{necessity}} or {{in deference}} to his dismounted commander or associates, his conduct was the same. He would stand like a rock in the open when officers and men alike had taken to cover; while men older in service and years, higher in rank and of unquestionable intrepidity, were loyally preserving behind {{the crest of a}} hill lives infinitely precious to their country, this fellow would stand, equally idle, on the ridge, facing {{in the direction of the}} <b>sharpest</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The sailors, {{furious at}} what they {{considered}} treachery, fetched a light that was burning in the captain's cabin, and without mercy ran through two or three unwounded men whom they found hiding among the fallen. It was soon clear that the reinforcement that had landed had completely turned the tables. Gradually the din rolled away from the neighbourhood of the storehouses, there was some <b>sharp</b> <b>firing</b> as the enemy fled towards the wood behind, and then all was quiet. Presently there was a shout in Mr. Hill's voice from the shore: ...|$|R
60|$|Then Sigurd {{went to his}} mother, {{and asked}} for the broken pieces of his father's blade, and gave them to Regin. And he {{hammered}} and wrought them into a new sword, so <b>sharp</b> that <b>fire</b> seemed to burn along its edges.|$|R
60|$|The rifles, {{both from}} the terrace and the {{platforms}} below, cracked out in rapid succession, and another rocket flew {{up into the air}} and burst. Before its light had faded out, each of the defenders had fired his four shots.

60|$|So far {{the bank}} had been left alone; but it was now its turn, and the mob poured down upon it. As they came up, a <b>sharp</b> <b>fire</b> broke out from every window, {{answered}} by a discharge of muskets and pistols from the crowd. Here men fell fast, but they had been worked up to such a pitch of excitement, and fanaticism, that the gaps were more than filled by fresh comers.|$|E
60|$|Beaujeu had {{intended}} to place his men in ambuscade at the ford, but, owing to various delays caused by the Indians, {{he was still a}} mile away from the ford when the British crossed.

The Indians raised their war whoop, and, spreading right and left among the trees, opened a <b>sharp</b> <b>fire</b> upon the British.|$|E

The first American soldier {{to step on}} the Cuban shore from this expedition was Lieutenant Crofton, Captain O’Connor with the first boatload having gone a longer route. A reef near the beach threw the men out, and they stumbled through the water up to their breasts. When they reached dry land they immediately went into the bush to form a picket-line. Two horses had been forced to swim ashore, when suddenly a rifle-shot, followed by continuous <b>sharp</b> <b>firing,</b> warned the men that the enemy had been in waiting.|$|R
60|$|During {{the night}} all of Lee's army withdrew within their intrenchments. On {{the morning of}} the 7th General Custer drove the enemy's cavalry from Catharpin Furnace to Todd's Tavern. Pickets and skirmishers were sent along our entire front to find the {{position}} of the enemy. Some went as far as {{a mile and a half}} before finding him. But Lee showed no disposition to come out of his Works. There was no battle during the day, and but little firing except in Warren's front; he being directed about noon to make a reconnoissance in force. This drew some <b>sharp</b> <b>firing,</b> but there was no attempt on the part of Lee to drive him back. This ended the Battle of the Wilderness.|$|R

60|$|In their march, the British were waylaid and {{harassed by}} Colonel Glover of Massachusetts, with his own, Reed's and Shepard's regiments of infantry.

60|$|Out on {{the main}} road leading to the {{principal}} bridge over the river the sun was boiling hot, and many a soldier felt more like seeking shelter and resting than like pushing forward with his heavy gun and other equipments. But General Lawton was here and there, encouraging every one, and they pushed on until a <b>sharp</b> <b>fire</b> between the enemy and the advance guard told that a running fight, and perhaps a regular battle, would soon be at hand.|$|E
6000|$|The sentry at once challenged, when Lieutenant Doubarsoff, the {{commander}} of the Czarevich, answered [...] "Friends."

But Lieutenant Doubarsoff succeeded in attaching his torpedo-chain to a rope hanging at the monitor's bows, and then rapidly backed his little vessel and fired the torpedo. A tremendous explosion; a column of water shot up into the air, and the launch was nearly swamped! A breach had, however, been made in the Hifse Rahman's bulwarks.|$|E

50|$|The Battle of Hiltersried {{took place}} on 21 September 1433 near the village Hiltersried in Bavaria. A Bavarian feudal army under Count Palatine John of Neumarkt took an {{expedition}} against in the Upper Palatinate against marauding Hussites and soundly defeated the Hussite section whose task was to ensure the protection for troops besieging Pilsen. The Hussites, who on that day were not expecting any attack, were totally surprised {{and did not have}} time to prepare to defend. After a <b>sharp</b> <b>firing</b> crossbows, the mounted knights attacked in wedge formation toward the entrance to the camp. At the same time the infantry attacked from the wings, binding part of the struggle of defenders. After the Hussite knighthood broke the defense and burst into the camp, the defense started the rout. Knights of the Palatinate took chase.|$|R
6000|$|The van of {{the advance}} {{had indeed been}} taken by surprise. It was {{composed}} of two companies of carpenters or pioneers to cut the road, and two flank companies of grenadiers to protect them. Suddenly the engineer who preceded them to mark out the road gave the alarm, [...] "French and Indians!" [...] A body of them was approaching rapidly. There was <b>sharp</b> <b>firing</b> on both sides at first. Several of the enemy fell; among them their leader; but a murderous fire broke out from among trees and a ravine on the right, and the woods resounded with unearthly whoops and yellings. The Indian rifle was at work, levelled by unseen hands. Most of the grenadiers {{and many of the}} pioneers were shot down. The survivors were driven in on the advance.|$|R
60|$|The skipper came on board, and {{immediately}} there commenced {{between him and}} the captain a <b>sharp</b> <b>fire</b> of questions and answers, which roused me from a slumber in which I had been indulging, and hurried me on deck. Here the face of things had changed. The hatches were off, and bales of goods were scattered about in all directions. Another small schooner had arrived, and the process of discharging the vessel was going rapidly forward. A boat was then dispatched to the factory with the packet-box and letter-bag, and soon after the Frances stood in for the shore.|$|E
60|$|Soon after {{daylight}} Peterborough {{gave the}} order to advance, and in the highest spirits, and in excellent order, the soldiers pushed up the hill toward the fort. Some irregular Spanish troops {{were the first to}} perceive them. These fired a hasty volley at the British troops as they ascended the crest and then retreated into the fort. Seizing their arms the garrison rushed to the ramparts and manned them in time to receive the assailants with a <b>sharp</b> <b>fire.</b> The grenadiers who formed the leading party did not hesitate for a moment, but leaped into the unfinished ditch, clambered up the outer rampart, and with pike and bayonet attacked the defenders.|$|E
60|$|Major Kincaid rode forward, to {{the edge}} of the steep slope that looked down to the town. He could see no one moving about. The Dervish trenches, about eighty yards away, {{appeared}} empty; and he was about to write a message to the General, saying that the place was deserted, when a <b>sharp</b> <b>fire</b> suddenly opened upon him. He turned to ride back to warn the General, but he was too late; for, at the same moment, Hunter with his staff galloped up {{to the edge}} of the slope, and was immediately saluted by a heavy volley; which, however, was fired so wildly that none of the party was hit.|$|E

60|$|Captain Noton {{placed his}} force in an enclosure, with a bank three feet high. His right flank was {{protected}} by the river; and a small tank, some sixty paces in front, was occupied by a strong picket. On his left, somewhat to the rear, was another tank, and at this the native levies were placed. The main position was held by the sepoys, with the two six-pounders. As the Burmese advanced, a <b>sharp</b> <b>fire</b> was opened upon them; but they availed themselves of every irregularity of the ground, and of cover of all kinds, and threw up shelter banks with such rapidity that the fire was, by no means, so effective as had been expected.|$|E
60|$|The Peoria took a {{position}} within short {{range of the}} fort to protect a landing or cover a retreat, and the small boats headed for the shore. They reached it five hundred yards east of the fort; the boats were beached, and their occupants cautiously scrambled toward the brush. But at almost the very moment they {{set foot on the}} sand, the fort and the entrenchments around it burst into flame, and shot and shell screamed about the little band of invaders. Captain Nunez was stepping from his boat when a shot struck him between the eyes and he went down dead. Chanler fell with a broken arm. The others safely gained a thicket and replied with a <b>sharp</b> <b>fire</b> directed at the entrenchments.|$|E
