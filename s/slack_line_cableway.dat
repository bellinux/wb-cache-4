40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if stability and proprioception scores improved on college-aged students using a <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> device. Methods: One group of 20 participants aged 18 - 23 from a Midwestern university performed a pre-test/post-test on a computerized posturography plate to determine Center of Pressure (CoP) and Limit of Stability (LoS) scores.   Participants performed three 20 - 30 minute sessions per week of balance and proprioceptive training using a Balance Bow for a period of four weeks. Data were analyzed (SPSS 21. 0) using a dependent t-test to determine if any changes occurred between pre- and post-test scores after four weeks.   Results: The analyses found no significance difference in Center of Pressure (CoP), normal stability eyes open (NSEO), normal stability eyes closed (NSEC), perturbed stability eyes open (PSEO), perturbed stability eyes closed (PSEC), or LoS forward (F), backward (B), or right (R) scores in college-aged participants. A significant difference was found in LoS left (L) and a notable trend towards significance was found in LoS R results. Conclusion: With the exception of LoS L stability scores, it was concluded that 12 sessions of 20 - 30 minutes, utilizing a <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> device, over a four week training period did not significantly improve stability and proprioceptive scores of the ankle in college-aged participants.

50|$|Catch {{and release}} is a {{practice}} within recreational fishing {{intended as a}} technique of conservation. After capture, the fish are unhooked {{and returned to the}} water. Often, a fast measurement and weighing of the fish is worthwhile. Using barbless hooks, it is often possible to release the fish without removing it from the water (a <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> is frequently sufficient).|$|R

50|$|During 2012, {{a version}} of this rig called the flying chod rig was made popular by Jim Shelley. Whereas on a normal chod rig the short hook length is held in place by a stop on the line, a flying chod does not use any form of stop: when a fish picks up the bait it can run freely. Jim Shelley used this {{technique}} in conjunction with <b>slack</b> <b>lines</b> and putting his rod tops in the air.|$|R
50|$|Reels for {{distance}} lines {{may have a}} locking mechanism, ratchet or adjustable drag to control deployment {{of the line and}} a winding handle to help keep <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> under control and rewind line.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of design {{challenges}} facing mooring systems of floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) platforms in an offshore environment. Some unique aspects of the FOWT industry should be considered when examining applicability of established offshore mooring practices. Important among these are: economy and cost effectiveness; light weight minimal platforms; and water depths ranging from 50 – 300 m. A lighter displacement platform in shallow water, supported by lines with light to moderate pre-tension can result in a higher probability of <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> events and hence snap loads during re-engagement. Such loads can result in shock on the line material and considerably reduce the fatigue life. Such events have the potential to occur in various sea states, and not necessarily limited to extreme conditions. These conditions will be dependent on structure resonant motions, which are influenced by wind loads and moments, wave conditions and mooring line properties. Model tests of typical concepts for FOWT reported in literature have shown occasional <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> episodes. This paper is a review of literature on snap load occurrence in marine applications, including lifting and lowering operations, ROV and diving bell operations. This paper presents a case study of a FOWT. Special focus is on mooring systems which are affected by impact load conditions. Criteria are reviewed and consequences are documented...|$|R
40|$|The {{black bream}} Acanthopagrus butcheri {{recreational}} fishery {{is the largest}} estuarine fishery in Victoria. This fishery is managed through legal-minimum length and daily bag limits. The success of this management strategy requires a high survival rate for released fish. Deep-hooking is known to reduce the chance of fish survival after recreational capture and release. This study investigated the potential to reduce deep-hooking {{and the number of}} under-size A. butcheri caught by varying angling gear and techniques. Three sizes of long shank hook (small [size 8], medium [size 4] and large [size 1 / 0]) and two angling techniques (<b>slack</b> <b>line</b> and tight line) were tested for their deep-hooking rates and selectivity characteristics. Increasing the hook size from small to large decreased the likelihood of deep-hooking by 6. 6 times (95 % CI 2. 3 – 16. 3 times). Fishing with a tight line instead of a <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> decreased the chance of deep-hooking by almost 100 % (95 % CI 0. 8 – 3. 6). Fishing with a large hook instead of a small hook significantly (F = 6. 71, df = 2, P = < 0. 001) increased the mean A. butcheri length, although this mean size increase was less than 1 cm. This study was able to identify angling gear and angling technique manipulations that reduced the rate of deep-hooking when targeting A. butcheri in Victorian estuaries. <br /...|$|R

6000|$|The boat shot ahead, and we {{were about}} to dart a second harpoon into the whale's side, when it took to [...] "sounding,"--which means, that it went {{straight}} down, head foremost, into the depths of the sea. At that moment Tom Lokins uttered a cry of mingled anger and disappointment. We all turned round and saw our shipmate standing with the <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> in his hand, and such an expression on his weather-beaten face, that I could scarce help laughing. The harpoon had not been well fixed; it had lost its hold, and the fish was now free! ...|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} other ropes were passed {{down to the}} squire. One he placed round his own waist; two others he fastened {{one on each side}} of the horse's girth. Then his friend lowered the bridle, and he managed to put it on the horse and attached a rope to it. The fishermen took the lines, and, paying out as they went so as to leave plenty of <b>slack</b> <b>line,</b> got on the rocks just above the little beach whereon, sheltered though it was, the seas broke heavily. There they waited, ready to pull the horse through the surf when he should have come close enough.|$|R
60|$|Scarcely had I {{said that}} when a smashing break in the water {{on the other side}} of the boat alarmed and further excited me. I did not see the fish. But I jumped up and bent over the stern to shove my rod deep into the water back of the propeller. I did this despite the {{certainty}} that the fish had broken loose. It was a wise move, for the rod was nearly pulled out of my hands. I lifted it, bent double, and began to wind furiously. So intent was I on the job of getting up the <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> that I scarcely looked up from the reel.|$|R
6000|$|Then we {{ran away}} from the fish, {{circling}} and letting out <b>slack</b> <b>line.</b> When {{we came to the}} end of the line we turned back a little, and with a big slack we took the risk of cutting the line and tying it on the other reel. We had just got this done when the line straightened tight! I wound in about twelve hundred feet of line and was tired and wet when I had gotten in all I could pull. This brought us to within a couple of hundred feet of our quarry. Also it brought us to five o'clock. Five hours!... I began to have queer sensations--aches, pains, tremblings, saggings. Likewise misgivings! ...|$|R
50|$|Emergency furling is {{fast and}} simple. When {{the sheets and}} halyard are let go, the sail will blow down wind, drop into the cradle of the topping lifts, while being steadied by the full battens.

For non-emergency furling, it is {{preferable}} to drop the sail with two crew so that the slackening lines can be hauled in and maintained in order. Alternatively, a single-handed sailor can lower the sail in stages and attend to the <b>slack</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
60|$|When I strolled {{around the}} pond in misty weather I was {{sometimes}} {{amused by the}} primitive mode which some ruder fisherman had adopted. He would perhaps have placed alder branches over the narrow holes in the ice, which were four or five rods apart and an equal distance from the shore, and having fastened {{the end of the}} line to a stick to prevent its being pulled through, have passed the <b>slack</b> <b>line</b> over a twig of the alder, a foot or more above the ice, and tied a dry oak leaf to it, which, being pulled down, would show when he had a bite. These alders loomed through the mist at regular intervals as you walked half way round the pond.|$|R
50|$|From the angler's standpoint, the {{delivery}} is a non-stop series of rhythmic strokes that jerk the lure by snapping <b>slack</b> <b>line.</b> This causes the lure to zigzag about 6 in to alternating sides without pause. The rod-tip must move further than six inches {{to overcome the}} line-slack, otherwise a short jerk would be unproductive. From the fish's standpoint, it's a frightened creature that's basically treading water {{with a lot of}} wasted motion. The success of walking the dog is partly because the lure never stops moving, making it difficult for bass to get a good look. In addition, the lure spends its time scooting back-and-forth with little meaningful forward progress, in other words, walking the dog offers deceptively slow coverage yet the lure is hard to identify.|$|R
60|$|Then we waded up-shore {{farther and}} began to fish. In just five minutes I had {{the same kind of}} strike, slight, almost imperceptible, vibrating, and I hooked a fish exactly as I had the first one. He was light of weight, but swift as a flash. I played him from where I stood. This time I essayed with all skill to keep a taut line. It was impossible. Now I felt his weight and again only a <b>slack</b> <b>line.</b> This fish, too, ran right to my feet, then in a boiling splash sheered away. But he could not go far.

He slid out, wrathfully wagging his bill, and left a seamy, foamy track behind him, finally to end that play with a splendid long leap. He was headed away from us now, with two hundred yards of line out, going hard and fast, {{and we had to}} follow him. We had a fine straightaway run to recover the line. This was a thrilling chase, and one, I think, we never would have had if R. C. had been using heavy tackle. The sailfish led us out half a mile before he sounded.|$|R

50|$|Fly reels, or fly casting reels, {{with a few}} exceptions, {{are really}} little more than line-storage devices. In use, a fly angler strips line off the reel {{with one hand while}} casting and {{manipulating}} the rod with the other. <b>Slack</b> <b>line</b> is picked up by rotating the reel spool. Even today, the vast majority of fly reels are manually operated, single-action reels of rather simple construction, with a simple click-pawl drag system. However, in recent years, more advanced fly reels have been developed for larger fish and more demanding conditions. These newer reels feature disc-type mechanical, adjustable drag systems to permit the use of lighter leaders and tippets, or to successfully capture fish that undertake long, powerful runs. Many newer fly reels have large arbors to increase the speed of the retrieve and to improve drag performance during long runs. In order to prevent corrosion, saltwater fly reels often use aluminum frames and spools or stainless steel components with sealed bearing and drive mechanisms.|$|R
