25|$|<b>Sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> (sometimes {{known as}} opinion mining or emotion AI) {{refers to the}} use of natural {{language}} processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. <b>Sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of a project whose {{objective}} has been to develop and deploy a sports equipment rental marketplace. Also we have developed an emotion and <b>sentiments</b> <b>analysis</b> system in comments for Wordpress based on Senpy. For deploying the marketplace, we have used the CMS Wordpress which has accelerated and facilitated many tasks. Several existing Wordpress plugins have been used to cover various functionalities. For the emotions and <b>sentiments</b> <b>analysis</b> system, a Wordpress plugin has been developed. Two versions of this plugin have been programmed. The first one can be downloaded from Wordpress's official plugin repository and the other one is specific for the marketplace. For carrying out the emotion and <b>sentiments</b> <b>analysis</b> we have used mainly Senpy. The Wordpress plugin lets the user to configure all of the Senpy's parameters for making the comments analysis. All this information is stored in Wordpress's database for later viewing. The user will be able to configure the comment's view. For the marketplace, the visualization system shows to each shop and to Kibiwoo's administrator an overview of the sentiments and emotions expressed by users on comments about their products. For this issue, we have used wpDataTables Wordpress plugin that uses Google Charts, HighCharts and Charts. js coding libraries for rendering data in charts and tables. Finally, several Schema. org's schemas have been used to add semantic information to the marketplace using Microdata. This way we improve the marketplace and its shops online visibility among search engines. As a result, this project will allow us to carry out an extensive analysis of the user's comments, being able to transmit this information to the stores in a user-friendly way s...|$|R

25|$|Except the {{difficulty}} of the <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> itself, applying <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> on reviews or feedback also face the challenge of spam and biased reviews. One direction of work is focused on evaluating the helpfulness of each review. Review or feedback poorly written are hardly helpful for recommender system. Besides, a review can be designed to hinder sales of a target product, thus be harmful to the recommender system even it is well written.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, the {{structure}} of sentiments and topics is fairly complex. Also, the problem of <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> is non-monotonic in respect to sentence extension and stop-word substitution (compare THEY would not let my dog stay in this hotel vs I would not let my dog stay in this hotel). To address this issue a number of rule-based and reasoning-based approaches have been applied to <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis,</b> including defeasible logic programming. Also, there is a number of tree traversal rules applied to syntactic parse tree to extract the topicality of sentiment in open domain setting.|$|E

30|$|From the {{literature}} review, Internet big data sources related to present capital markets research {{can be categorized}} into forum-type data, microblog-type data and search class data. Based on these data, researchers can build some more complicated variables to analyze traditional questions. With regards to research about investors’ sentiments based on Internet big data, the main methods of <b>sentiments</b> <b>analysis</b> include building an inventory of lexical categories, using dictionaries for analysis of lexical categories, and machine learning. Many studies analyze whether Internet big data can predict capital markets. but they reach no consistent conclusions, which {{might be due to}} sample and analysis methodlimitations.|$|R
25|$|One {{step towards}} this aim is {{accomplished}} in research. Several research teams in universities {{around the world}} currently focus on understanding the dynamics of sentiment in e-communities through <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis.</b> The CyberEmotions project, for instance, recently identified the role of negative emotions in driving social networks discussions.|$|E
25|$|Open source {{software}} tools deploy machine learning, statistics, and {{natural language processing}} techniques to automate <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> on large collections of texts, including web pages, online news, internet discussion groups, online reviews, web blogs, and social media. Knowledge-based systems, on the other hand, make use of publicly available resources, to extract the semantic and affective information associated with natural language concepts. <b>Sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> can also be performed on visual content, i.e., images and videos. One of the first approach in this direction is SentiBank utilizing an adjective noun pair representation of visual content. In addition, {{the vast majority of}} sentiment classification approaches rely on the bag-of-words model, which disregards context, grammar and even word order. Approaches that analyses the sentiment based on how words compose the meaning of longer phrases have shown better result, but they incur an additional annotation overhead.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Supervised {{methods of}} <b>sentiment</b> {{orientation}} <b>analysis</b> have got {{more and more}} attention for which don’t require labeled corpus and can be applied to different domains. However, traditional methods mostly consider single words which ignore the dependencies between the words of each other. To solve the problem, this paper presents an unsupervised method for <b>sentiment</b> orientation <b>analysis</b> on micro-blog based on dependency parsing and HDP model. Firstly, this method uses dependency parsing to filter the words in the corpus. Secondly, the HDP model is used to mine the implicit topics in the document. Then, a sentiment dictionary is used to calculate the sentiment distributions of the topics. Finally, the sentiment orientation of the whole micro-blog is obtained {{on the basis of the}} sentiment distributions of the topics. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively identify the sentiment orientation of micro-blog...|$|R

25|$|For a {{recommender}} system, <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> {{has been}} {{proven to be a}} valuable technique. A recommender system aims to predict the preference to an item of a target user. Mainstream recommender systems work on explicit data set. For example, collaborative filtering works on the rating matrix, and content-based filtering works on the meta-data of the items.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{to better}} fit market needs, {{evaluation}} of <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> {{has moved to}} more task-based measures, formulated together with representatives from PR agencies and market research professionals. The focus in e.g. the RepLab evaluation data set is less {{on the content of}} the text under consideration and more on the effect of the text in question on brand reputation.|$|E
25|$|It {{refers to}} {{determining}} the opinions or sentiments expressed on different features or aspects of entities, e.g., {{of a cell}} phone, a digital camera, or a bank. A feature or aspect is an attribute or component of an entity, e.g., the screen of a cell phone, the service for a restaurant, or the picture quality of a camera. The advantage of feature-based <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> is the possibility to capture nuances about objects of interest. Different features can generate different sentiment responses, for example a hotel can have a convenient location, but mediocre food. This problem involves several sub-problems, e.g., identifying relevant entities, extracting their features/aspects, and determining whether an opinion expressed on each feature/aspect is positive, negative or neutral. The automatic identification of features can be performed with syntactic methods, with topic modeling, or with deep learning. More detailed discussions about this level of <b>sentiment</b> <b>analysis</b> {{can be found in}} Liu's work.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} individual-level and contextual correlates of punitive attitudes in the United States. Prior {{research suggests that}} the demographic composition and economic conditions of geographic areas influence public support for punitive policies. Yet, these findings rest on assumptions about individual perceptions of minority groups as threatening. This work builds on the threat framework by measuring the concept of "perceived threat " and examining the association between aggregate social conditions, perceived threat and punitive <b>sentiments.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of newly collected data suggests that individual perceptions of African Americans as threatening to economic resources is a strong predictor of punitive attitudes. In addition, respondents residing in areas with higher unemployment rates and places that experienced a recent increase {{in the size of the}} African American population are more punitive. The latter effect is largely mediated by perceptions of African Americans as threatening to material resources for white respondents...|$|R
