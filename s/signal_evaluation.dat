In a recent study, the relative contributions of individual tooth components (enamel, crown dentin and root) to the total response of a whole tooth inside an L-band surface coil resonator was investigated. In the present work, the gamma-dose response curves were evaluated for different EPR <b>signal</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods, using 35 whole teeth with absorbed doses in the range 1 - 100 Gy. The paper reports on the first attempt to deconvolute the single composite L-band EPR line in components due to CO 2 - and native radicals. The L-band EPR spectrum of teeth could be approximated by combining powder-simulated spectra of orthorhombic and quasi-axial signals of the CO 2 - radical and an isotropic signal of the native radicals. Among the applied EPR <b>signal</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods, the evaluation by spectrum deconvolution. revealed the lowest detection limit for absorbed dose.
