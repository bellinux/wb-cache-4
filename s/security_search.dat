500|$|In contrast, a French poet at Mary's court, Pierre de Boscosel de Chastelard, was {{apparently}} besotted by Mary. In early 1563, he was discovered during a <b>security</b> <b>search</b> hidden underneath her bed, apparently planning to surprise {{her when she}} was alone and declare his love for her. Mary was horrified and banished him from Scotland. He ignored the edict, and two days later he forced his way into her chamber as she was about to disrobe. She reacted with fury and fear, and when Moray rushed into the room, in reaction to her cries for help, she shouted, [...] "Thrust your dagger into the villain!", which Moray refused to do, as Chastelard was already under restraint. Chastelard was tried for treason, and beheaded. Maitland claimed that Chastelard's ardour was feigned, and that he was part of a Huguenot plot to discredit Mary by tarnishing her reputation.|$|E
