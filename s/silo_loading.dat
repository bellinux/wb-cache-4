40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{eccentric}} discharge of bulk solids from silos can lead to pressure asymmetry which may have serious structural consequences. For steel silos, such pressure asymmetry is likely to lead to high local axial compressive stresses and consequently buckling failures of the silo. In existing <b>silo</b> <b>loading</b> codes, the pressure changes due to discharge eccentricity are represented by local pressure increases (or reductions) which are commonly referred to as patch loads, as the complexity of real eccentric discharge pressures has not been well understood. In general, the specification of patch loads to represent the effect of real eccentric discharge pressures has been done without a rigorous assessment of their structural consequences. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the results of a finite element investigation into the buckling strengths of steel silos subject to code-specified pressures for eccentric discharge. The study shows that although the patch loads specified in these codes vary greatly from one code to another and may have a great effect on the linear bifurcation load, their effect on buckling loads determined using more sophisticated buckling analyses with the effect of geometric non-linearity taken into account is small. Instead, the axisymmetric primary wall loads are shown to control the buckling loads. It can thus be concluded that the patch loads specified in existing <b>silo</b> <b>loading</b> codes are inadequate in representing the effect of discharge eccentricity if this effect is important in reality, when the specified loads are used in a non-linear buckling analysis. If this effect is as small as shown by the non-linear buckling loads presented in this paper, then this effect can be easily covered by a small increase in the primary wall loads which represents a much simpler approach.

40|$|Measurements {{show that}} silo wall {{pressures}} exhibit large fluctuations {{in time and}} space during discharge of the silo. This observation is important for the design of the silo wall because spatial pressure variations may impose substantial bending moments that otherwise may be small or vanishing due to the carrying ability of the membrane forces in the silo wall. Information about the stochastic properties of this pressure variation cannot be obtained from any existing continuum model for the silo medium flowing within the confinement of the silo walls. Therefore the modeling must presently be tied to statistical analysis of the empirical evidence combined with simple mechanical principles.

40|$|Os silos metálicos cilíndricos de chapa corrugada e cobertura cônica são as unidades mais utilizadas no Brasil para o armazenamento de produtos granulares. As principais ações variáveis que atuam sobre os silos são as pressões devidas aos produtos armazenados e ao vento, sendo esta ação crítica quando o silo se encontra vazio. Devido à grande eficiência estrutural da forma cilíndrica e à resistência elevada do aço, estas estruturas são leves e delgadas e, portanto, suscetíveis a perdas de estabilidade local e global e arrancamento. Com a finalidade de avaliar estes efeitos foram realizados estudos teóricos e experimentais sobre as ações do vento em silos. O trabalho foi desenvolvido com ensaios de modelos aerodinâmicos e aeroelásticos em um túnel de vento na Universidade de Cranfield, Inglaterra, com o objetivo de determinar os coeficientes aerodinâmicos no costado e na cobertura. Os resultados mostram que os valores dos coeficientes recomendados pela Norma Brasileira de vento, NBR 6123 (1990), são adequados para o costado. Para a cobertura cônica, como não são especificados pela NBR, são recomendados valores dos coeficientes aerodinâmicos determinados nos ensaios. Conclui-se também que a colocação externa das colunas é a favor da segurança e que o uso de anéis enrijecedores no costado é indicado e muito importante para a estabilidade local e global da estrutura do silo. The steel {{cylindrical}} silos made of {{corrugated sheets}} with conical roofs {{are the most}} used units to the storage of granular materials. The main <b>silo</b> <b>loads</b> are the pressures due to the stored material and to the wind, being this action the critical one when the silo is empty. Due to the high efficiency of the cylindrical form and to the high strength of the steel, these structures are thin and light-weight and, as a consequence, susceptible {{to the loss of}} local and global stability and to the pull out of the structure. With the aim to assess these effects related to the wind <b>loading</b> in <b>silos,</b> some theoretical and experimental studies were conducted. The work was carried out with aerodynamic and aeroelastic models tested in a boundary layer wind tunnel in the University of Cranfield, England, with the objective to determine the aerodynamic coefficients of the cylinder and the conical roof.

The coefficients to the conical roof are suggested based on our tests, considering that there are no values specified by the NBR.

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{characteristics}} of pulsating or cyclic flow of bulk solids during gravity discharge in bins and <b>silos.</b> The dynamic <b>load</b> phenomenon {{is often referred to}} as "silo quaking" and is known to occur in silos of various geometrical shapes, operating under different flow patterns. Examples include mass-flow, funnel-flow, expanded-flow, multi-outlet bins and bins operating under intermediate-flow. While silo quaking is often associated with tall bins, depending on the flow pattern, the problem can also be experienced in bins of squat proportions. The period of pulsations during flow is influenced by various factors, such as, particle size and size distribution, silo wall material and wall roughness, internal friction, moisture content and discharge flow rate. Of particular relevance is the influence of slip-stick effects during shear flow, and velocity at critical sections in the silo during discharge.

Both <b>silos</b> were <b>loaded</b> {{in one of the}} gondolas of the large diameter centrifuge facility (located at ESTEC) in which an apparent gravity up to 20 times the Earth’s gravity can be established. To simulate low gravity conditions, we submitted a horizontal monolayer of metallic beads to the centrifuge force of a small rotation device (located at University of Liege). The influences of both gravity and aperture size on the mass flow were analysed in these various conditions. For the three systems (cylindrical silo, the Hele-shaw silo and the monolayer of beads), we demonstrated that (i) the square root scaling of the gravity found by Beverloo is relevant and (ii) the critical aperture size below which the flow is jammed does not significantly increase with the apparent gravity. Moreover, we studied in more details the Hele-Shaw silo in high gravity because this configuration allowed to determine local properties of the flow {{at the level of the}} aperture. We measured the velocity profiles and the packing fraction profiles for the various aperture sizes and apparent high gravities. We demonstrate the existence of a slip length for the flow at the level of the aperture. This later fact seems to result from the geometrical configuration of the silo...|$|R
40|$|Silos {{generally}} work as {{storage structures}} between {{supply and demand}} for various goods, and their structural safety has long been {{of interest to the}} civil engineering profession. This is especially true for dynamically <b>loaded</b> <b>silos,</b> e. g., in case of seismic excitation. Particularly thin-walled cylindrical silos are highly vulnerable to seismic induced pressures, which can cause critical buckling phenomena of the silo shell. The analysis of silos can be carried out in two different ways. In the first, the seismic loading is modeled through statically equivalent loads acting on the shell. Alternatively, a time history analysis might be carried out, in which nonlinear phenomena due to the filling as well as the interaction between the shell and the granular material are taken into account. The paper presents a comparison of these approaches. The model used for the nonlinear time history analysis considers the granular material by means of the intergranular strain approach for hypoplasticity theory. The interaction effects between the granular material and the shell is represented by contact elements. Additionally, soil–structure interaction effects are taken into account...|$|R

This feature of loess is known as structural collapse, or hydro collapse, {{making it one of the}} meta-stable soils, which are very unfavourable in terms of foundation. During the construction of the silo, due to inadequate protection during the intense rainfall, partial saturation of the surface layers has occurred, which undermined the initial structure of the loess and caused additional settlements that were registered during the first filling of the silo. To assess the development of settlements in these changed circumstances, the settlement calculations were performed, based on the collapse potential, increase of moisture, wetting depth and available quantity of rainfall for given location according to data from the National Hydro Meteorological Institute. Prediction of the expected subsequent settlements was crucial for undertaking necessary measures in order to ensure the smooth functioning o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of particle size distribution on the mechanical properties of granular sulphur and its relation to silo blockage at South Pars Gas Complex Phases 2 & 3. Solid elemental sulphur is a relatively hard, friable crystalline material that tends to break up into smaller particles when subjected to force or stress of any magnitude. Conglomeration of the dust so produced clogs storage <b>silos,</b> making truck <b>loading</b> difficult. Grain size selection is based on the “friability value ” and “maximum entropy ” for granules in a static state. The model of the behavior of confined granular sulphur is based on the principle of continuum mechanics. Granules were formed by feeding liquid sulphur and water to a rotating granulation drum. Sample granules were classified into different size fractions (300 µm – 4. 75 mm) by sieve analysis, and friability tests were done by the Fines 28 -inch tumbler S 5 - 77 test. Friability and granule size data collected over four years were studied. The implication of field analysis and laboratory tests is that the granule size should be controlled during sulphur solidification while ensuring that only granular material with the correct mechanical characteristics is stored in the silo and shipped...|$|R

A number of failures have been recorded {{in the past few decades}} for steel liquid tanks and <b>silos</b> under wind <b>loading.</b> A steel conical tank vessel will have a relatively small thickness making it susceptible to buckling under wind loads especially when they are not fully-filled.

The tested tank configuration represents combined conical tanks where the cone is capped with a cylinder. In addition, the effect of terrain exposure and wind speed on the pressure values and wind forces is assessed. The mean and rms pressure coefficients are presented for different test cases in addition to the mean and rms total drag forces that are obtained by integrating the pressure coefficient over the tank model’s surface. It is found that the total mean and rms drag forces are highly-dependent on Reynolds number which is a function of wind speed and they have a maximum value at mid-height for the lower cylinder, at top for the conical part, and at bottom for the upper cylindrical part...|$|R
