Users have improvised ways to downgrade the firmware on the Zune device to older version that support Asian characters (V1 Zunes can be hacked to display Asian font). This is, however, not recommended by anyone, as future firmware versions contain significant improvements and added codec support.|$|E

25|$|Following {{its debut}} as a 1974 model, the sporty Laguna Type S-3 left the lineup briefly, then reappeared in January 1975. This time, it wore a rakishly slanted, urethane-covered aero-style nose {{designed}} for NASCAR (first use on a Chevrolet vehicle - later to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1983-88 Monte Carlo SS), louvered opera windows, {{and could be}} ordered with a vinyl half-roof.

25|$|In {{the pilot}} episode, {{and for the}} first season, Crockett pilots a Chris Craft Stinger 390 X - a 39-foot deep-v {{offshore}} racing boat. According to T. Rafael Cimino, marine director for Miami Vice, a total of five Stinger 390 Xs were used on the show. A white 390 X was selected for the pilot episode as it would show up better for the night scenes. For the other four Stingers, Chris-Craft showed the production crew a colour scheme that included the red - however, since Michael Mann decided that the colour red was to never <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show so a blue colour scheme was instead chosen. The Stingers used on the show were not free from Chris-Craft. In fact, the boats had some serious warranty issues. These issues caused the production team to switch to using Wellcraft 38 Scarab KVs {{for the remainder of the}} show. The Scarab 38 KVs were a 28-hued, twin 440-hp boat that sold for $130,000 in 1986.|$|E
500|$|Some American social critics, such as Laurence H. Shoup, {{argue that}} the Council on Foreign Relations is an [...] "imperial brain trust" [...] which has, for decades, played a central behind-the-scenes role in shaping U.S. foreign policy choices for the post-World War II {{international}} order and the Cold War by determining what options <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> agenda and what options do not even {{make it to the}} table; others, such as G. William Domhoff, argue that it is in fact a mere policy discussion forum which provides the business input to U.S. foreign policy planning. Domhoff argues that [...] "t has nearly 3,000 members, far too many for secret plans to be kept within the group. All the council does is sponsor discussion groups, debates and speakers. As far as being secretive, it issues annual reports and allows access to its historical archives." [...] However, all these critics agree that [...] "istorical studies of the CFR show that it has a very different role in the overall power structure than what is claimed by conspiracy theorists." ...|$|E

Both Ash and David J released solo albums during the Love and Rockets years; Murphy contributed backing vocals to David J's 1992 single [...] "Candy on the Cross".|$|E

[...] The route was paved when it {{was added to the}} primary highway system. [...] In 2002, more than [...] of low-traffic state highways, including Iowa91, were identified by the Iowa DOT because they primarily served local traffic. [...] Typically, when the DOT wished to transfer a road to a county or locality, both parties had to agree to terms and the DOT would have to either improve the road or give money to the other party to maintain the road. [...] However, with the significant mileage the DOT wished to turn over, the Iowa General Assembly passed a law which granted the DOT a one-time exemption from the transfer rules effective July 1, 2003. [...] Iowa91 was replaced by CRL14.|$|E

2500|$|Marinovich {{had serious}} {{substance}} abuse issues throughout his NFL career. During his rookie season, he increased his partying {{and drug use}} beyond marijuana, including taking pharmaceutical amphetamines before games. Because of his college arrest for cocaine possession, the NFL required him to submit to frequent drug tests. Marinovich passed the tests using friends' urine, but after using the urine of a teammate who had been drinking heavily, the test registered a blood alcohol content [...] four times the legal limit and caused the Raiders to force him into rehabilitation. The Raiders held an intervention for him after the season, and Marinovich spent 45 days at a rehab facility. In the 1992 season Marinovich shifted to using LSD after games, because it would not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drug test. His play suffered and his coaches complained he was not grasping the complex offense. He failed his second NFL drug test and went back into rehabilitation. In training camp before the 1993 season, Marinovich failed his third NFL drug test, this time for marijuana, and was suspended for the 1993 season. The Raiders released Marinovich on the final cutdown, choosing not to pay for Marinovich's salary while being suspended {{in the year before}} the salary cap would go into effect.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} signaling {{technology and}} subsequent enhancements {{used to control}} the trains was developed by Westinghouse. When revenue service began, [...] "ghost trains" [...] (or false occupancies), trains that <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> computer system as being {{in a specific place}} but don't physically exist, were common, and real trains could at times disappear from the system. This was the result of dew on the tracks and too low of a voltage (at 0.6 volts rather than the industry standard 15 volts) being passed through the rails for train detection. Under such circumstances, trains had to be operated manually and were restricted to a speed of [...] Enhancements were made to the train control system to address these [...] "ghost trains" [...] (or false occupancies). However, manual blocking— operators in a booth on the platform at alternate stations, with a telephone and red/green lights — that kept trains in stations until the train ahead had left its station were mandated for several years. This caused a great outcry in the press and led to a flurry of litigation between Westinghouse, the original controls contractor, and BART, as well as public battles between the state government (advised by University of California professor Dr. Bill Wattenburg), the federal government, and the district, but in time these problems were resolved and BART became a reliable service. Ghost trains persisted on the system as late as 2007, and while usually cleared quickly enough to avoid significant delay, they can occasionally cause an extended backup of manually operated trains in the system. In addition, the fare card system was easily hackable with equipment commonly found in universities, although most of these flaws have been fixed.|$|E
