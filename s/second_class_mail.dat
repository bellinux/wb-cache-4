In 1942, the periodical's <b>second</b> <b>class</b> <b>mailing</b> permit was revoked under the Espionage Act of 1917 {{as part of}} Attorney General Francis Biddle's efforts against [...] "vermin" [...] publications.

In August 1918 the publication was deprived {{of the right to}} receive first <b>class</b> <b>mail,</b> with all letters from subscribers and readers sent to the publication summarily returned to sender with the envelope stamped [...] "Mail to This Address Undeliverable Under Espionage Act." [...] The paper was twice raided by the U.S. Department of Justice and subscriber records were seized.|$|R
2500|$|The Leader, as an anti-war publication, {{drew the}} ire of the Wilson {{administration}} and its Postmaster General, Albert S. Burleson and in October 1917 had its <b>Second</b> <b>Class</b> <b>mailing</b> privileges revoked. In August 1918 the publication was deprived {{of the right to}} receive First <b>Class</b> <b>mail,</b> with all letters from subscribers and readers sent to the publication summarily returned to sender with the envelope stamped [...] "Mail to This Address Undeliverable Under Espionage Act." [...] Despite the attack, loyal Milwaukee readers and advertisers rallied around the paper with monetary donations and the publication survived the attack. Through it all, Work wrote extensively on anti-militarist themes including, according to his own testimony, four of the five editorials for which Victor Berger was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago in December 1918.|$|R

50|$|In the 1998, Brown traded The Western Star {{along with}} the Star Press in Springboro, Today's Express in Morrow, the Monroe Times, and the Miamisburg-West Carrollton News to The Thomson Corporation, a Canadian {{newspaper}} company known for the poor quality of its publications, in exchange for three daily papers, the Piqua Daily Call, the Xenia Daily Gazette, and the Greenville Daily Advocate. When the company decided to exit the newspaper business, Thomson sold The Western Star to Cox on September 1, 2000, though only after Thomson's original plans to sell the paper to Gannett, owner of The Cincinnati Enquirer, fell apart. From late 1991 to January 13, 2013, the paper issued a free Sunday edition, although for its last few years it contained exclusively advertising. Under Cox it surrendered its <b>second</b> <b>class</b> <b>mailing</b> permit, ceased its distribution {{in the southern part}} of Warren County, and began to be distributed free to homes in Lebanon and Turtlecreek Township.|$|R
25|$|On 1 January 2006, the Royal Mail {{lost its}} 350-year {{monopoly}} and the British postal market became fully open to competition. Competitors {{were allowed to}} collect and sort mail, and pass it to Royal Mail for delivery, a service known as downstream access. Royal Mail introduced pricing in proportion (PiP) for first and <b>second</b> <b>class</b> inland <b>mail,</b> whereby prices {{are affected by the}} size as well as weight of items. It also introduced an online postage service, allowing customers to pay for postage online.|$|R
50|$|With {{the end of}} the Civil War, {{the firm}} grew rapidly along the {{expanding}} railroads as they opened up the West, with the commencement of coast-to-coast continental rail service in 1869. Legislation passed by Congress required the railroads to transport newspapers and periodicals as <b>second</b> <b>class</b> bulk <b>mail</b> at a special low subsidized rate—one cent per pound for any distance between news agencies, so that a bundle of New York newspapers could be sent across the continent to Los Angeles for the same price that it could be shipped across the river to Newark—and ANC exploited the availability of cheap rail transport to expand their distribution network across the continent, so far ahead of the competition that they effectively shut any possible rivals out of the market, establishing their periodical depots by the hundreds in every city and large town on the rail system. At the same time, the number of periodicals being published in America was exploding: Frank Mott, in A History of American Magazines, estimates that the number of titles being published boomed from 700 at {{the end of the}} Civil War to 3300 in 1885.|$|R
50|$|A special PBM or Play by Mail mode was {{introduced}} in F1GP. Players would choose one of the drivers for the particular race and when their turn was up save the game onto floppy disk. The disk would then be sent via <b>second</b> <b>class</b> <b>mail</b> to other participants in the event to continue with their turn. This would again be saved and the disk mailed out to the next participant. The PBM mode could extend to include a full seasons championship.|$|E

Besides occasional letter columns, beginning with issue #19 (Aug. 15, 1972), prominent fans Don and Maggie Thompson began a monthly column, [...] "Beautiful Balloons." [...] A news column, [...] "What Now?" [...] by Murray Bishoff, was added with #26 (Dec. 1, 1972). These provided the editorial content required by the United States Postal Service to qualify for <b>second</b> <b>class</b> <b>mail</b> (along with paid subscriptions being instituted with issue #27, Jan. 1, 1973).|$|E
5000|$|The American Woman's League {{was created}} by the {{magazine}} publisher Edward Gardner Lewis in 1907. In part, it was a maneuver to lower postal rates by appealing to educational and social opportunities that would appeal to the emerging women's suffrage movement. His magazines, Woman's Magazine and the Woman's Farm Journal, had been denied second class postal rates because they were judged as advertisements and thus did not qualify for a lower rate as <b>second</b> <b>class</b> <b>mail.</b> Rather than magazine sales representatives making commissions, as was the common practice at the time, the payments went to form local women's [...] "Chapter Houses".|$|E

There was also an effort to decapitate the radical Hungarian labor movement through the jailing of its leaders, including Bérmunkás editor Károly Rotfischer, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison as a result of a prosecution set in motion by the United States Department of Justice.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{graphite}} {{lines were}} used exclusively on five stamps of the Wilding series from December 1957. They appear as {{one or two}} black lines printed vertically under the gum. The two lined stamps were to identify fully paid mail, which eventually became first class mail, while stamps with only one line paid the printed matter rate, or <b>second</b> <b>class</b> <b>mail</b> as it eventually became. On the two lined stamps, the bands are usually found widely spaced so that one appears at {{either side of the}} stamp, but they may also be found close together due to printing errors on the one and a half pence stamp. Several other errors of misplaced graphite lines are also known and not all are included in the Stanley Gibbons catalogue.|$|E

40|$|The British Post Office {{introduced}} {{two-tier pricing}} in the 1970 s. The basic {{idea was to}} differentiate First Class from <b>Second</b> <b>Class</b> <b>mail</b> according to service quality rather than content. Processing of <b>Second</b> <b>Class</b> <b>Mail</b> is deferred during peak periods, recognizing inter alia the added cost of meeting fixed service standards at such times. The introduction of two-tier pricing was a major breakthrough at the time, both from a practical {{as well as a}} theoretical point of view, and it has been employed successfully in varying forms by several other Post Offices (POs) since then. Crew, Kleindorfer and Smith (1990) (CKS) showed how two-tier pricing was related to the mainstream of the theory of peak-load pricing, which can be traced back at least to Boiteux (1949). CKS demonstrated that such servicedifferentiated pricing offered an efficient solution to the peak-load problem. In practice, the system of First Class and Second Class has continued basically unchanged from the original path-breaking idea of the 70 ’s, with some adjustments being made in the application, definition and measurement of service standards. In other areas of the postal sector, considerable change has taken place, not least in the continuation of the process of liberalization of postal markets worldwide and especially in the EU. In addition, POs are facing significant electronic competition, principally from the Internet, which was not envisaged a decade ago.

The article {{suggests}} that the closing order may be complete or may be partial. (It is actually somewhat unclear from the article which ban will be issued. The article starts by suggesting the ban will be complete, but then shifts to discussing a partial ban.) • A strict closing order will close almost everything—every business and places of amusement, including stores, saloons, churches, etc. • 614 new cases and 41 deaths have been reported over the weekend. • Doctors are reported too busy treating victims to file reports of new cases and deaths. • Nurses and doctors are sick.

Theater owners are already taking measures to disperse crowds. • Complaints are being raised that crowding in the street cars is the cause of the disease’s continued spread. It was noted that the Electric company is not running all of its available street cars and that its drivers are only working 6 hours a day. Alderman William Aldridge called for more effort to put additional street cars in service. • Police officers will receive shots of the flu vaccine. • Establishments that fail to enforce the ban on dancing may lose their liquor license.
