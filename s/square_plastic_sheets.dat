30|$|Food {{sources were}} used in order to study the first genus in {{discovering}} the resource, the recruitment dynamics and the behavioral dominance among the different genera (Fellers 1987; Savolainen and Vepsäläinen 1988; Andersen 1997; Morrison et al. 2000). Four different types of food were offered simultaneously on “a station” (a <b>square</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> of 20  cm × 20  cm): commercial canned tuna in oil, commercial canned corned meat, honey-water and raw lean beef in similar amounts (ca. 1  g). Within the square sheet, each food {{was placed in the}} center of each quarter (i.e. 10 × 10  cm). A total of 32 baits were placed on 8 stations during 70  min. Every 10  min (from T 0 [*]=[*]time 0  min to T 7 [*]=[*]time 70  min), a photo of each bait was taken (Canon EOS 400 D XTi, Canon EF 50 mm Compact macro lens); recordings and notes about the species visiting the baits were also made in parallel. Later in laboratory, the number of ants per species was counted per bait from the photos taken, in conjunction with ant samples taken from food bait stations.|$|R
40|$|A {{perforated}} 4. 6 m <b>square</b> sticky <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> {{placed under}} the canopy of a tree heavily populated with European chafers, Rhizotrogus majalis (Razoumowsky), consistently captured more beetles than a 15 -w blacklight survey trap. The same size sheet, operating with a bird shield under a sparsely populated tree that represented conditions encountered during survey operations, demonstrated detection capability {{equal to that of}} the light trap. Bird shields prevented trapping of birds. Lawn injury beneath the sheeting due to heat build-up was not serious. Results suggest that a sticky sheet is an alternative, less expensive, equally effective survey tool for detection of European chafer infestation...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a final {{documentation of}} the project whose goal is demonstrating manufacturability of soft lithography. Specifically, our target is creating micron scale patterns of resists on a 3 square inch, relatively large area in case of soft lithography, flexible substrate using microcontact printing in order to forming electronic circuit patterns for flexible displays. At first, the general principles and characteristics of soft lithography are reviewed {{in order to provide}} the snapshot of soft lithography technologies, and the key factors that affect the productivity and quality of microcontact printing are discussed because such factors should be understood in advanced to develop current lab-based microcontact printing science into plant manufacturing technology. We proposed a prototype for automated of microcontact printing process adopting a continuous reel-to-reel design, ideal for mass production, as well as printing-side-up design in order to minimize the distortion of relief features of PDMS stamp. The machine we created not only demonstrated the manufacturability of microcontact printing, our initial project goal, but also high scalability for mass production. The machine can print micron scale patterns on a 7 <b>square</b> inch <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet,</b> four times bigger than initial target area, at once. by Hyung-Jun Kim. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} various substrata on the {{settlement}} of a pearl oyster, Pinctada martensii, was evaluated. The settlement of the larvae in the experiments with four different color substrata was compared and showed that deep color <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> (red and blue) attracted significantly more larvae (P < 0. 05) than light color (green and yellow). In addition, the influence of biofilm substrata was {{compared with that of}} non-film substrata of smooth or rough texture. Number of settled larvae was highest on biofilmed <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets,</b> either rough or smooth, then rough <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> without film, the least recorded was on smooth <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> without biofilm. Substrates of <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> coated with tissue extracts of the same species appeared to attract larval settlement. The number of settled larvae on substrates with tissue extracts was significantly greater (P < 0. 05) than that on the control. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The effects of water, glycerol, methyl glucoside, ZnSO 4, epichlorohydrin, and glutaric dialdehyde on the {{mechanical}} properties of soy protein <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> were studied. The thermal transition temperatures and dynamic mechanical properties of soy protein plastics were also investigated. Depending on the moisture and glycerol contents, soy protein <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> displayed properties from rigid to soft. The glass transition temperatures of the sheets varied from ca. 27 to 508 C with moisture contents ranging from 26 to 2. 8 % and 30 parts of glycerol.

The b-transitions of soy protein <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> ranged from 233 to 2728 C depending on the moisture.

40|$|Thermoforming is {{a generic}} {{term for the}} {{manufacturing}} of plastic components through a vacuum or a pressure forming process. The first and most critical phase in thermoforming is sheet heating. For a thick-gage <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet,</b> the combination of conduction and radiation energy, which conducts and transmits into the sheet interior, controls the heating cycle time. In order to predict the formability of a thick-gage sheet and improve production efficiency, {{we need to know}} the internal temperature of the <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> during the heating phase in thermoforming. Unfortunately, the internal temperature of the sheet is impossible to measure directly. To overcome this problem, it is possible to use a soft-sensor technique, which uses the surface temperature of a <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> that can be measured by infrared sensors to estimate the internal temperature of the sheet. A soft sensor system was defined by using a finite difference equation. Experiments and simulations were performed to determine how well the soft sensor was able to predict the temperature distribution inside a <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet.</b> The sensitivities of some key parameters, e. g., material absorptivity, thermal diffusivity, view factor and oven air temperature, are analyzed and discussed...|$|R
