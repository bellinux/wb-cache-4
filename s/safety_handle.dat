50|$|The classic {{hand grenade}} design has a <b>safety</b> <b>handle</b> or lever (known in the US forces as the spoon) and a {{removable}} safety pin that prevents the handle from being released: the safety lever is spring-loaded, {{and once the}} safety pin is removed, the lever will release and ignite the detonator, then fall off. Thus, to use a grenade, the lever is grasped (to prevent release), then the pin is removed, and then the grenade is thrown, which releases the lever and ignites the detonator, triggering explosion. Some grenade types also have a safety clip to prevent the handle from coming off in transit.|$|E
40|$|This degree {{project is}} divided into two sub{{projects}}. Both of the projects are executed for Fogmaker, a company that specialises in designing and installing fire suppression systems in engine compartments. These projects are executed according to product development methods. The first subproject described in this report is about designing a handle for the transportation of a 35 kg weighing fire extinguisher. The handle functions as a safety seal and as a grip that makes it easier and safer to lift the fire extinguisher. A casted zinc T-handle is the best solution based on cost and AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) analysis. An FMECA (Failure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis) and a FEM (Finite Element Method) study have been performed to verify the design. A zinc prototype of the <b>safety</b> <b>handle</b> has been manufactured and is ready for testing. It is expected that 10. 000 handles will be produced every year once this prototype is approved by Fogmaker. The second subproject concerns a connection hub placed on a pressurized bottle. In order to make the fire suppression system more reliable this component needs to be redesigned. An external company with the required expertise in hydraulic systems will develop the connection hub in cooperation with Fogmaker, based on the conceptual designs described in this report. An FMECA of the new connection hub concept proves this redesign increases the safety of the system. The overlying subject of both of these projects is the safety of the fire suppression system. Thanks to the accomplishment of both project, the system has become safer and more reliable...|$|E

50|$|The Cabri G2 is a two-seat light {{helicopter}} with a three-bladed fully articulated {{main rotor}} and a Fenestron-type tail rotor. The main rotor {{is designed to}} enable flight within a wide envelope of weather conditions, while the composite rotor blades are damage-tolerant and have no set life span. The use of the Fenestron has been credited as having made the Cabri noticeably quieter than competing rotorcraft such as the Sikorsky S-300, {{in addition to its}} favourable <b>safety,</b> <b>handling,</b> and maneuverability attributes. The Cabri uses a skid landing gear arrangement; unusually, the skids are attached to the fuselage by elastomeric mounts rather than being directly bolted on to reduce ground resonance and provide greater articulation. The fuselage features a damage-resistant all-composite monocoque construction, reducing weight and maintenance requirements while increasing strength.|$|R
