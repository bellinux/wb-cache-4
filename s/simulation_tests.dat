40|$|As the {{development}} of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), software testing for WSN-based applications be-comes more and more important. <b>Simulation</b> <b>testing</b> is an important approach to WSN-based software testing, and TOSSIM is {{the most widely used}} <b>simulation</b> <b>testing</b> tool targeted at TinyOS which is the most popular operating system nowadays. However, <b>simulation</b> <b>testing</b> tools such as TOSSIM can not reveal program er-rors about communication detail or timing, and lack accurate power consumption model and even can not support power consumption estimation. In this paper, a hybrid testbed H-TOSSIM is proposed, which ex-tends TOSSIM with physical nodes. H-TOSSIM uses three physical nodes, of which, one shares the simu-lated environment with all virtual nodes to test the WSN program, and the other two bridge the real world and the simulated environment. H-TOSSIM combines the advantages of both the simulation in physical node and the <b>simulation</b> <b>testing</b> tools in WSN software testing. Through experiments, we show that H-TOSSIM really reveals program errors which the pure <b>simulation</b> <b>testing</b> can not capture, and can support power con-sumption estimation for large WSN with high accuracy and low hardware cost...|$|R

50|$|Recommended {{approaches}} {{to test for}} discriminant validity on the construct level are AVE-SE comparisons (Fornell & Larcker, 1981; note: hereby the measurement error-adjusted inter-construct correlations derived from the CFA model should be used rather than raw correlations derived from the data.) and {{the assessment of the}} HTMT ration (Henseler et al., 2014). <b>Simulation</b> <b>tests</b> reveal that the former performs poorly for variance-based structural equation models (SEM), e.g. PLS, but well for covariance-based SEM, e.g. Amos, and the latter performs well for both types of SEM. Voorhees et al. (2015) recommend combining both methods for covariance-based SEM with a HTMT cutoff of 0.85. A recommended approach to test for discriminant validity on the item level is exploratory factor analysis (EFA).|$|E

50|$|Two X-31s were built, {{with the}} first flying on October 11, 1990. Over 500 test flights were carried out between 1990 and 1995. The X-31 is a canard delta, a delta wing {{aircraft}} which uses canard foreplanes for primary pitch control, with secondary thrust-vectoring control. The canard delta had earlier been used on the Saab Viggen strike fighter, and has since become common on fighters such as the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale and Gripen which were all designed and flew several years before the X-31. The X-31 featured a cranked-delta wing (similar to the Saab J35 Draken and the F-16XL prototype), and fixed strakes along the aft fuselage, {{as well as a}} pair of movable computer-controlled canards to increase stability and maneuverability. There are no moveable horizontal tail surfaces, only the vertical fin with rudder. Pitch and yaw are controlled by the canard with the aid of the three paddles directing the exhaust (thrust vectoring). Eventually, <b>simulation</b> <b>tests</b> on one of the X-31s showed that flight would have been stable had the plane been designed without the vertical fin, because the thrust-vectoring nozzle provided sufficient yaw and pitch control.|$|E
