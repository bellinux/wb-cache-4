5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2007, UBS became the first Wall Street firm to announce a heavy loss in the subprime mortgage sector as the <b>subprime</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>crisis</b> began to develop. In May 2007, UBS announced the closure of its Dillon Read Capital Management (DRCM) division. Before that time, there was little understanding of the troubles at DRCM or the massive expansion of risk engineered by the investment banking division {{under the leadership of}} the newly placed CEO Huw Jenkins.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a report}} by the Diário de Notícias, Portugal had allowed {{considerable}} slippage in state-managed public works and inflated top management and head officer bonuses and wages in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010. Persistent and lasting recruitment policies boosted the number of redundant public servants. Risky credit, public debt creation, and European structural and cohesion funds were mismanaged across almost four decades. When the global crisis disrupted the markets and the world economy, together with the US <b>subprime</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>crisis</b> and the eurozone crisis, Portugal {{was one of the first}} economies to succumb, and was affected very deeply.|$|E
5|$|KFN was {{an early}} {{casualty}} of the <b>subprime</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>crisis</b> and in September 2007, Henry Kravis and George Roberts injected $270 million into the company. On February 20, 2008, KFN was once again forced to delay the repayment {{of billions of dollars}} of commercial paper, and began a new round of talks with creditors.

5|$|Lynch {{has been}} a member of the House Financial Services Committee since his first term. According to CQ, Lynch {{supported}} President George W. Bush's agenda one-third of the time, which was average for Democratic House members. For instance, he supported the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which addressed the <b>subprime</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>crisis,</b> but opposed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 which created the Troubled Asset Relief Program. He has supported President Barack Obama's economic agenda, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.|$|E
5|$|A win by McCain over Huckabee in South Carolina, and by Romney over McCain in childhood-home Michigan, set up {{a pivotal}} battle in the Florida primary. Romney campaigned intensively on {{economic}} issues and the burgeoning <b>subprime</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>crisis,</b> while McCain attacked Romney regarding Iraq policy and benefited from endorsements from Florida officeholders. McCain won a 5percentage point victory on January 29. Although many Republican officials were now lining up behind McCain, Romney persisted through the nationwide Super Tuesday contests on February 5. There he won primaries or caucuses in several states, but McCain won in more and in larger-population ones. Trailing McCain in delegates by a more than two-to-one margin, Romney announced {{the end of his}} campaign on February 7.|$|E

Three years earlier, Blair had announced that he would not be contesting a fourth successive general election as Labour Party leader if he won the 2005 general election. Brown initially had strong public support and plans for a quick general election were widely publicised, though never officially announced. On 18th February 2008, Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that the failing bank, Northern Rock, would be nationalised, supporting it with loans and guarantees of £50,000,000,000. The bank had been destabilised by the US <b>subprime</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>crisis</b> the previous year, and a private buyer of the bank could not be found.|$|E

5|$|On September 24, McCain {{said he was}} {{temporarily}} suspending his campaign activities, called on Obama to join him, and proposed delaying {{the first of the}} general election debates with Obama, in order to work on the proposed U.S. financial system bailout before Congress, which was targeted at addressing the <b>subprime</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>crisis</b> and liquidity crisis. McCain's intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement. After Obama declined McCain's suspension suggestion, McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26. On October 1, McCain voted in favor of a revised $700 billion rescue plan. Another debate was held on October 7; like the first one, polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it. A final presidential debate occurred on October 15.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a <b>subprime</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>crisis,</b> soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix has {{maintained}} a growth streak in recent years, growing by 24.2% before 2007. This made it the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, surpassed only by Las Vegas. In 2008, Squaw Peak, the second tallest mountain in the city, was renamed Piestewa Peak after Army Specialist Lori Ann Piestewa, an Arizonan and the first Native American woman to die in combat while serving in the U.S. military, {{as well as being}} the first American female casualty of the 2003 Iraq War. 2008 also saw Phoenix as one of the cities hardest hit by the <b>subprime</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>crisis,</b> and by early 2009 the median home price was $150,000, down from its $262,000 peak in 2007. Crime rates in Phoenix have gone down in recent years, and once troubled, decaying neighborhoods such as South Mountain, Alhambra, and Maryvale have recovered and stabilized. Recently, downtown Phoenix and the central core have experienced renewed interest and growth, resulting in numerous restaurants, stores, and businesses opening or relocating to central Phoenix.|$|E
