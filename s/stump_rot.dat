40|$|NYS IPM Type: Vegetables IPM Fact SheetBlack rot, {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, is considered the most serious disease of crucifer crops worldwide. This disease {{is also known as}} blight, black stem, black vein, stem rot, and <b>stump</b> <b>rot.</b> All crucifer crops are susceptible to black rot; radish and kale, however, are less easily infected. Plants that are not in the crucifer family are not susceptible. Yield can be affected in several ways: infected plants may die prematurely, heads may remain small, and quality may be reduced because of symptoms on the marketable part of the plant. Removing symptomatic leaves increases production costs. Soft rot may develop after black rot, further reducing quality and storage life...|$|E
40|$|In Western Australia, {{reports of}} <b>stump</b> <b>rot</b> and wind-throw losses in second {{rotation}} Eucalyptus globulus coppice plantations {{led to an}} investigation of the possible negative impacts of fungi colonising stumps. Surveys showed that a variety of fungi colonise stumps, but no geographic trends were apparent. As plantations are harvested at different times of the year, it was hypothesized that differences between plantations may be due to harvest times coinciding with different fungal fruiting and dispersal times. This was tested by harvesting fifteen trees at each season (spring-Oct 2006, summer-Jan 2007, autumn-May 2007, and winter-July 2007). Five of the trees were assigned as controls and only had wood samples analysed for the presence of fungi at the start and end of the experiment. The remaining ten trees were sampled for fungi at the time of harvest and 1, 4, 8 and 12 months after harvest. The aim was to observe seasonal differences in fungal community development within the outer sapwood and the inner discoloured central core. Presence of fungi was determined using molecular and classical cultural techniques. In the classical approach wood samples extracted from the stumps were plated on four different agar media to select for as wide variety of fungi as possible. The molecular approach used RFLP analysis of genes encoding rRNA to detect the presence of any fungi in the samples. Results from this investigation will be presented and discussed...|$|E
50|$|Kearny's Stump is {{a granite}} marker {{in the shape}} of a tree stump, located a few feet away from the memorial. The {{original}} tree stump was purported to be the spot where Kearny was killed, though he is now known to have died in a cornfield about 150 yd away (outside the bounds of the current-day park). The stump was however used as the origin of the survey used to define the memorial plot, so when the original <b>stump</b> <b>rotted</b> away it was replaced with a stone version.|$|R
40|$|In one cypress dome in the Everglades National Park, cypress knees seem {{to develop}} from {{vertical}} root loops that grow along and ramify into dead cypress stumps. Nearly all young root loops emerge {{close to a}} decaying stump. The proportion of these associations decreases as the diameter and presumed age of the loops increase.

40|$|Forest {{soils are}} profoundly {{influenced}} by the biomechanical {{as well as the}} chemical and biological effects of trees. Studies of biomechanical impacts have focused mainly on uprooting (treethrow), but this study shows that at least two other effects are significant: physical displacement of soil by root growth, and infilling of <b>stump</b> <b>rot</b> pits. Rocky soils in the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas were studied because they allow for the use of rock fragments as a tracer of displacement. Rock fragments displaced by tree growth (baumsteins) are ubiquitous here, and displacement shows characteristic differences between pines and hardwoods. Hardwoods promote primarily lat-eral displacement, with a higher probability of displaced rock fragments eventually falling into stump holes. Pine displacement has a significant vertical component associated with basal mounding, and a lower probability of baumstein deposition in stump holes. Obvious stump holes are relatively rare, but the high ratio of stumps and snags to uprooted trees indicates that standing dead trees, which would ultimately result in a stump hole, are quite common. This, plus the presence of numerous duff-filled depressions, suggests that such holes are filled rapidly. The presence of surface-derived rock fragments and thick litter and duff accumulations indicate {{that at least some of}} the fill is external, as opposed to soil detachment from the pit walls. The primary influence of stump holes, as reflected by rock fragment distributions, is localized subsurface stone accumulations that do not extend laterally. The total area affected by uprooting is larger than that of stump holes, despite the lower frequency, du...|$|E

40|$|These {{data are}} a part of a study of small mammal populations at Cedar Creek Forest, Anoka County, Minnesota. The live-trapping area of 5. 0 acres, with 81 traps spaced 52 feet apart, was in a tamarack-white cedar bog. The study {{extended}} over a period of 7 years (1949 - 1955). Trapping periods of five days (four nights) extended from early May to the first part of October. In all, there were 14, 580 trap-nights. A total of 428 voles were marked and weighed; data on 25 dead unmarked individuals are also included. A frequency index was calculated for each station. This index was arrived at by multiplying the number of individuals caught at a station by the number of years they occurred at that station. These indices were grouped and represented on a map. Clethrionomys occupied mostly the white cedar area with sparse to medium cover.

50|$|Fossils of Hylonomus {{have been}} found in the remains of fossilized club moss stumps in Joggins, Nova Scotia, Canada.

Small animals such as Hylonomus, seeking shelter, would enter and become trapped, starving to death. An alternative hypothesis is that the animals made their nests in the hollow tree stumps.Fossils of the basal pelycosaur Archaeothyris and the basal diapsid Petrolacosaurus are also found in the same region of Nova Scotia, although from a higher stratum, dated approximately 6 million years later.|$|R
