500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to <b>say</b> <b>our</b> final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst , who I adore, is still in charge I want him {{to be the one to}} oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud." [...] Windsor resumed filming on 21 March 2016.|$|E

2500|$|During his {{period in}} Milan, Montini was {{widely seen as}} a {{progressive}} member of the Catholic hierarchy. He reformed pastoral care, adopting new approaches. He used his authority {{to ensure that the}} liturgical reforms of Pius XII were carried out at the local level and employed innovative methods to reach the people of Milan. For example, huge posters announced throughout the city that 1,000 voices would speak to them from 10 to 24 November 1957. More than 500 priests and many bishops, cardinals and lay people delivered 7,000 sermons in the period not only in churches but in factories, meeting halls, houses, courtyards, schools, offices, military barracks, hospitals, hotels and other places, wherever people congregated. His goal was the re-introduction of faith to a city without much religion.

2500|$|Obama won the Iowa caucuses with 38% of the vote, over Edwards, 30%, and Clinton, 29%.

[...] The delegate count was virtually tied, but Clinton's surprising third-place finish in the popular vote damaged her image as the [...] "inevitable" [...] nominee.

Regulate with exquisite minuteness the cries of the baby in the cradle, the laughter of the hoop-trundling boy, the murmurrings of the toothless old man." [...] In the 1860s, the anti-trundling campaign was taken up by Charles Babbage, who blamed the boys for driving iron hoops under horses' legs, with the result that the rider is thrown and very often the horse breaks a leg. Babbage achieved a certain notoriety in this matter, being denounced in debate in Commons in 1864 for [...] "commencing a crusade against the popular game of tip-cat and the trundling of hoops." ...|$|E

[...] Band member Jesse [...] "Baby J." [...] Fiske questions the importance of assigning a specific style: [...] "We're not really an old-time band either. As long as we speak to someone, it doesn't really matter what the genre is." [...] The group largely performs original material, with a traditional feel. [...] As former member Shawn Galbraith, banjo player, puts it: [...] "We play original material provided by different members of the band.

[...] "I don't think many people would call us a traditional oldtime band," [...] states bandleader David Sickmen: [...] "I'd <b>say</b> <b>our</b> songs are about ninety percent originals.

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{treaties}} remains a matter of confusion, some of {{which seems to be}} deliberate.

The leading historian of North Dakota, Elwyn B.

Even as soon as 1899, Euro-Americans were characterizing the 1863 and 1864 Treaties of Old Crossing as [...] "ending the trouble" [...] caused by the Sioux Uprising. The official Red Lake County history tour guide still characterizes the treaty as a [...] "peace treaty", as does the centennial history of Red Lake County, the split-off portion of the original Polk County in which the Old Crossing now is located. Describing the monument erected in 1932 to commemorate the Old Crossing Treaty, it states: Here at the [...] "Old Crossing" [...] is a monument which commemorates a peace pact....As the descendants of these self-same Indians [...] pause in its shadow they may well <b>say</b> <b>our</b> forefathers kept their faith, and be proud that this was done.|$|E
