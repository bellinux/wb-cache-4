5|$|According to IndieWire in May 2017, Amblin Television and Warner Bros. Animation are in {{the early}} stages of {{developing}} a reboot of Animaniacs. The interest in the reboot was driven by a surge of popularity for the <b>show</b> <b>when</b> it was made available on Netflix in 2016, plus numerous successful projects that have revived interest in older shows, such as Fuller House.|$|E

5|$|As Jesus vs. Santa {{became more}} popular, Parker and Stone began talks of {{developing}} the short into a television series. Fox refused {{to pick up the}} series, not wanting to air a show that included the character Mr. Hankey, a talking piece of feces. The two then entered negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids <b>show.</b> <b>When</b> Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog watched the short, he commissioned for it to be developed into a series.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{stations}} were {{built for the}} first stage, and five for the second stage. The stations and the visual profile of {{the system as a}} whole are designed by the Bergen-based design groups Cubus and Fuggi Baggi Design, and Copenhagen-based Kontrapunkt. The stations of the first two stages are at street level, with facilities for buying tickets and dynamic displays that <b>show</b> <b>when</b> the next tram will arrive. The platforms have step-free access to the trams, allowing unhindered accessibility by wheelchairs and perambulators.|$|E
5|$|In , Farber, Ruggiero and Mistysyn {{were given}} regular roles, as were Andrea Lewis (Hazel Aden) and Stepto, who had held {{recurring}} roles {{since the first}} season. Mike Lobel (Jay Hogart), Deanna Casaluce (Alex Nuñez), Ephraim Ellis (Rick Murray) and John Bregar (Dylan Michalchuk) were introduced in recurring roles as new students.

5|$|Scottie cramp is an {{autosomal}} recessive hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's ability to walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only <b>show</b> <b>when</b> the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are pushed out to the side, the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing the dog to fall should they be moving at speed. The condition is not seizure related, and the dog remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{comedy series}} focuses on Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), the deputy {{director}} of the parks and recreation department of the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. The season consisted of six 22-minute episodes, all of which aired at 8:30p.m. on Thursdays. Daniels and Schur conceived the <b>show</b> <b>when</b> NBC officials asked Daniels to produce a spin-off of his comedy series The Office, on which Schur was a writer. During development, the creators decided the new show would be a stand-alone series, though it would share the mockumentary style of The Office. Like that show, Parks and Recreation encouraged improvisation among its cast members.|$|E
5|$|The {{show was}} {{produced}} during the 2010 NRL season (corresponding to {{winter in the}} Southern Hemisphere). In New South Wales and Queensland, (in which NRL is the dominant football code), The Matty Johns Show was broadcast on Thursdays at 7.30pm, two hours before The Footy Show. In all other states (in which the Australian Football League predominates), The Matty Johns Show may have been broadcast Thursdays at 7.30pm, or broadcast around midnight, after The AFL Footy <b>Show.</b> <b>When</b> broadcast at 7.30pm, the show followed long-running soap opera Home and Away.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of the soft tissue of temnospondyls. A block of sandstone, {{described}} in 2007 from the Early Carboniferous Mauch Chunk Formation of Pennsylvania, included impressions of the bodies of three temnospondyls. These impressions <b>show,</b> <b>when</b> alive, they had smooth skin, robust limbs with webbed feet, and a ridge of skin on their undersides. Trackways referable to small temnospondyls have also been found in Carboniferous and Permian rocks. The trackways, called batrachichni, are usually found in strata deposited around freshwater environments, suggesting the animals had some ties to the water.|$|E
5|$|When the play's {{success on}} Broadway was clear, Woods {{launched}} productions {{of the play}} in other cities, starting with San Francisco. It opened there at the Geary Theater on December 30, 1935, and ran for five weeks with Nedda Harrigan in the lead role. Harrigan stayed with the <b>show</b> <b>when</b> it moved to the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, where it opened on March 1, 1936. After the Broadway production closed, Woods started a road tour that included productions in Boston and Chicago.|$|E

5|$|After {{these changes}} were made, the test {{audience}} became more {{appreciative of the}} series, and GSN announced its development {{to the public at}} an upfront presentation in New York City on March 21, 2012 for the network's upcoming programming. By this time, a pilot episode had already been shot with American stand-up comedian and television personality Jeff Foxworthy performing the hosting duties for the <b>show.</b> <b>When</b> first asked if he was interested in hosting the show, Foxworthy was hesitant; he agreed to take on the role after learning that contestants would be playing for charity rather than on their own behalf. Casting for the series was held in various cities from May to June 2012. On July 7, 2012, GSN confirmed the show would premiere on August 23, 2012, alongside the premiere of Beat the Chefs.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{agreed to}} take on Weinstein, who decided to redevelop his Probe {{published}} short story into a script for the animated Star Trek. Cooper addressed the script to D.C. Fontana, who had recently left the <b>show.</b> <b>When</b> it arrived at the production office, it was forwarded to Fontana unread, who sent it back to Cooper as {{she had left the}} show. The script was subsequently resubmitted by Weinstein under his agent's name for the second season of the show. Producer Lou Scheimer contacted Weinstein and informed him that they wanted to purchase the script if the ending could be modified, which Weinstein agreed to. Weinstein was 19 at the time and staying in the dormitory at the University of Connecticut, and Scheimer was surprised to find out that Weinstein was so young.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} {{where the first}} series of Red or Black? aired, ITV gained a much larger {{audience}} share than {{it had in the}} week directly previous, where it had been beaten by BBC One on six out of seven nights. Despite this, reviews of the first series were universally negative, and additional criticism was leveled at the <b>show</b> <b>when</b> it was discovered that Nathan Hageman, the first winner of the £1m prize, had a criminal record. The Sun began a campaign calling for Hageman to return the money, but he was eventually allowed to keep it. It did, however, lead to ITV dropping three other contestants from the show, with at least one withdrawn because of their criminal record. This was also {{a major factor in the}} pre-recording of series 2.|$|E

Marge reveals that Kang is Maggie's real father and explains how it happened. Kang and Kodos demand that the Simpsons give Maggie to them, and Kang and Homer start to fight until they are taken on The Jerry Springer <b>Show.</b> <b>When</b> an audience member criticizes Kang, he vaporizes her, as well {{as the rest of the}} audience and the film crew. After leaving the studio, Kang and Kodos threaten to destroy every politician in Washington unless given Maggie. Marge and the Simpsons slyly imply that the aliens could not possibly destroy every politician, and they fly off to do so.|$|E
5|$|Stafford {{moved from}} New York to California in November 1946, {{continuing}} to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances {{on the show}} to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the <b>show</b> <b>when</b> it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested {{using some of the}} folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student. The annual Jo Stafford Prize for American Folklore was handled by the American Folklore Society, with the first prize of $250 awarded in 1949.|$|E
5|$|The twelve-minute sketch {{was written}} by Michael O'Donoghue who {{wanted to create a}} scene that would {{showcase}} the acting talents of John Belushi. O'Donoghue had been the one who had initially persuaded producer Lorne Michaels to hire Belushi for the new Saturday Night Live program. O'Donoghue and Belushi recognized that the original Star Trek series itself was not a ratings success during its initial run, but had become much more successful during syndication. Belushi enjoyed the Star Trek series and wanted the part of Captain Kirk. He demonstrated his intense desire to get the role by trimming his sideburns to closely resemble Kirk's facial appearance in the original series. They worked together on the sketch for thirty-days and scheduled it for the final episode of the 1976 season of the <b>show</b> <b>when</b> it would be hosted by Elliott Gould.|$|E
