2500|$|Gross-Enzersdorf(Vienna 22). Groß-Enzersdorf {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{complete}} walled circuits in Lower Austria, although the three gates were finally removed in 1886. The town was originally sited on the former Sachengang Island in the river Danube and is first mentioned in 870 as a 'Meierhof, – probably a royal manor – [...] that was held by the Engelschalk family. This passed to the Bishopric of Passau and in 1202 Groß-Enzersdorf came into the control of the Bishops of Freising. At this time a market is mentioned at Groß-Enzersdorf [...] A charter was granted to the town in 1396 and Bishop of Freising, Berthold of Wehningen, who was also at the time Chancellor of Austria, arranged for a wall to be built, completed in 1399. Builders who had previously been working on St Stephen’s cathedral in Vienna, were brought in and stone and building materials were transported from the Roman site at Carnuntum. During the assault on Vienna in 1529, the Turks conquered and devastated the town. [...] Subsequently, Croats were brought in to resettled the town. The town was again taken by the Turks at the second siege of Vienna in 1683. In the Thirty Years War Swedish cavalry looted and burned the town. In 1809 the town was taken by Napoleonic forces prior to the nearby battle of Aspern.The walls stand to about six metres with the crunulations still largely intact. The length of <b>standing</b> <b>wall</b> is about 2.2 kilometre and the wall varies in thickness from 90 to 160 centimetres. The walls have a row of putlog holes on the outside, below the crenellations, suggesting that a wood hoarding existed, The defences were surrounded by moat, which were partially waterfilled until the early 19th century. The layout of the defended area is irregular, suggesting that additional areas must have been taken in when the wall was built. [...] There is a round tower at the most northern point and the remains of a rectangular tower set into the wall on the NE.

There were also two other gatetowers, the Wittau on the E and the Raasdorf or Vienna gate on the NE.|$|E
60|$|Akim {{is divided}} into eastern and western. Mr. H. Ponsonby, when {{travelling}} through both regions, found the natives getting quantities of gold by digging holes eight to ten feet deep {{on either side of}} the forest-paths. He saw as much as three ounces taken up in less than half an hour. Around the capital of eastern Akim, Kyebi, or Chyebi, the land is also honeycombed with man-holes, making night-travel dangerous to the stranger. It requires a sharp eye to detect the deserted pits, two feet in diameter and 'sunk straight, as if they had been bored with huge augurs.' I have seen something of the kind in the water-meadows near Shoreham. The workman descends by foot-holes, and works with a hoe four to six inches long by two broad: when his calabash is filled it is drawn up by his companions. The earthquakes of April and July 1862 [Footnote: I happened to be at Akra during the convulsion of July 10. The commandant, Major (now Colonel) de Buvignes, and I set out for a stroll along the sands to the west. The morning was close and cloudy: what little breeze there was came from the south-west, under a leaden sky and over a leaden sea. At 8.10 A.M., as we were returning from the rocks about three-quarters of a mile off, there was a sudden rambling like a distant thunder-clap; the sands seemed to wave up and down as a shaken carpet, and we both staggered forwards. Others described the movement as rising and falling like the waters of a lagoon. I looked with apprehension at the sea; but the direction of the shock was apparently from west-north-west; and the line was too oblique to produce one of those awful earthquake-waves, seventy feet high, which have swept tall ships over the roofs of cities. We ran as fast as we could to the town, where everything was in the wildest confusion. The 'Big House' and Mr. John Hansen's were mere ruins; the Court-house had come to pieces, and the prison-cells yawned open. I distinctly saw that the rock-ledge under Akra, between Fort James and Crèvecoeur, had been upraised: canoes passed over what was now dry. A second shock at 8.20 A.M., and a third about 10.45, completed the destruction, split every <b>standing</b> <b>wall,</b> and shook down the three forts into ruinous heaps. Nor did the seismic movements cease till July 15, when I made my escape.|$|E

5000|$|Rosemarie Castoro (1939-2015) was an American {{artist who}} worked in drawing, painting, sculpture, and other mediums. She was {{associated}} with Minimalism, Conceptual art, and concrete poetry. Castoro was a pioneer of monochrome painting and abstraction. Movement {{of the human body}} through physical space was a recurring theme in her work. In the 1960s, she participated in several performances with Minimal Dance pioneer Yvonne Rainer and became involved with the study of choreography at the Pratt Institute. Castoro graduated from the Pratt Institute, Cum Laude, with a BFA in 1963. In the 1970s, Castoro developed a strong focus on sculpture. In 1971 she created a series of giant minimal sculptures called Free <b>Standing</b> <b>Wall</b> Pieces which encouraged performative interaction. The surfaces of the panels are treated with graphite, gesso and marble dust, thickly applied creating massive rough brush strokes. According to a statement made by her gallery representative, “she was acutely aware that women artists working in a formalist style milieu were not spared the gender-based dismissal of the time,” even while she remained “strictly dedicated to her non-representational abstract style of work.” ...|$|E

40|$|A {{computationally}} efficient, high-resolution {{numerical model}} of shallow flow hydrodynamics is described, based on boundary-fitted adaptive quadtree grids. The numerical model solves the two-dimensional non-linear shallow water equations {{by means of}} an explicit second-order MUSCL-Hancock Godunov-type finite volume scheme. Interface fluxes are evaluated using an HLLC approximate Riemann solver. The model is based on dynamically adaptive quadtree grids, with Cartesian cut cells used to improve the fit to curved boundaries. A ghost-cell immersed boundary method is used to update flow information in the smallest cut cells in order to overcome the time step restriction that would otherwise apply. The numerical model is validated for reflection of a surge wave at a <b>standing</b> <b>wall,</b> low Froude number potential flow past a circular cylinder, and the shock-like interaction between a bore and a circular cylinder. Excellent agreement is obtained between the numerical predictions using the present scheme with analytical solutions and other numerical results presented in the literature. It is demonstrated that the computational efficiency is greatly improved compared with solutions on a uniform structured grid implemented with cut cells. ...|$|E
