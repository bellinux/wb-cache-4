50|$|In March 1783, the Belgioso or Count de Belgioso Imperial East Indiaman was sailing from Liverpool {{en route}} to China when it sank in a storm at Kish Bank near Dublin Bay in the Irish Sea. The cargo of the Belgioso was valued at £150,000, with £30,000 in silver and lead. The <b>salvage</b> <b>terms</b> agreed to by the owners were that Spalding would keep one-fourth of all silver and lead {{recovered}} and one-half of all other cargo. Additionally, if Spalding failed to recover anything, his entire expense for the operation would be defrayed.|$|E
50|$|The law {{seeks to}} do what is fair to both the {{property}} owners and the salvors. The right to salvage may not necessarily arise out of an actual contract but is a legal liability arising out of the fact that property has been recovered. The property owner who had benefit of the salvor's efforts must make remuneration, regardless of whether he had formed a contract or not. The assumption here is that when faced with the loss of his vessel and cargo, a reasonable prudent owner would have accepted <b>salvage</b> <b>terms</b> offered, even if time did not permit such negotiations.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the years}} {{numerous}} {{studies have been done}} to compare these methods of blood <b>salvage</b> in <b>terms</b> of safety, patient outcomes, and cost effectiveness, often with equivocal or contradictory results.|$|R
2500|$|At a Time Warner stockholders' meeting, Heston castigated {{the company}} for {{releasing}} an Ice-T album which included a song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] about killing police officers. While filming The Savage, Heston was initiated by blood into the Miniconjou Lakota Nation, {{saying that he had}} no natural American Indian heritage, but elected to be [...] "Native American" [...] to <b>salvage</b> the <b>term</b> from exclusively referring to American Indians.|$|R
50|$|The game {{starts with}} the player trying to finish a term paper at G.U.E. Tech, a large MIT-like American university. The player has braved a {{snowstorm}} {{to travel to the}} school's computer lab to work on the report. The document is now mangled beyond repair, however; {{with the help of a}} hacker, the player finds that the file has been partially overwritten by the Department of Alchemy's files. Although the game begins as a quest to try to <b>salvage</b> the <b>term</b> paper, alarming events soon unfold, revealing a powerful evil within the school's depths.|$|R
50|$|In January 1945, Wilhelm left Potsdam for Oberstdorf for a {{treatment}} of his gall and liver problems. Cecilie fled in early February 1945 as the Red Army drew closer to Berlin, {{without being able}} to <b>salvage</b> much in <b>terms</b> of her possessions. At the end of the war, Cecilienhof was seized by the Soviets.|$|R
50|$|The term, {{and indeed}} the {{practice}} of, rescue archaeology is largely restricted to North America, South America, Western Europe, and East Asia, especially the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Korea, and Japan. Many European countries, such as, e.g., Germany, practice virtually no rescue excavation (though there is extensive research archaeology). The many rescue archaeology projects in the Middle East are generally <b>termed</b> <b>salvage</b> archaeology.|$|R
40|$|Adequate {{drainage}} of venous {{blood is}} the most critical part of successful free tissue transfer. We report a case of anterolateral thigh flap used for covering open communited tibial fracture. The flap was <b>salvaged</b> with short <b>term</b> augmentation of venous drainage with external shunt. The drainage was continued for six days. It was confirmed {{that there is no}} more congestion after blocking the catheter and then the drainage was discontinued on seventh day. The flap was successfully salvaged. This method has potential applications in multiple situations for successful salvage of free tissue transfer...|$|R
30|$|Performance {{standards}} in SMCRA (Sections  515 (b)(5) and (6)) require that all topsoil be <b>salvaged.</b> The <b>term</b> “soil” refers to all surface soil material {{to a depth}} of broken bedrock that can be removed with a dozer. Soil includes the O, A, E, B, C, and R soil horizons, and should include soil organic matter and plant materials. If the topsoil is less than 15  cm thick (6 inches) thick and a topsoil substitute has not been approved, regulations require the operator to remove the topsoil along with a suitable amount of unconsolidated material immediately below the topsoil (C horizon) and treat the mixture as topsoil. Topsoil should be redistributed immediately unless it is impractical, in which case it should be stockpiled, segregated, and protected. When redistributed, the soil must achieve “an approximately uniform, stable thickness,” although that thickness may be varied to meet revegetation goals; and should be consistent with the post-mining land use, contours, and drainage systems. The soil redistribution operation should prevent excess compaction.|$|R
40|$|Symptomatic {{failure of}} Silastic 1 {{implants}} at the hallux metatarsophalangeal joint {{can result in}} the challenging problem of instability which may be painful. There is often marked bone loss making reconstruction difficult. Arthrodesis sacrifices joint movement while excision arthroplasty shortens the ray and is less acceptable to active patients. We describe {{a case in which}} reconstruction was achieved by using a porous coated metatarsophalangeal hemiarthroplasty augmented with bone graft with good early results. This previously unreported technique may offer an additional surgical option for reconstruction, maintaining joint movement without compromising future arthrodesis or excision arthroplasty as <b>salvage</b> measures. Long <b>term</b> follow up is required to confirm the success of this technique...|$|R
40|$|Local {{control of}} nasopharyngeal {{carcinoma}} has substantially improved with advancing radiotherapy technology and appropriate combination with chemotherapy. However, when local recurrence occurs, {{this is one}} of the most difficult challenges. Aggressive treatment is indicated because long <b>term</b> <b>salvage</b> is achievable particularly for early recurrence, but high risk of complications is a serious concern. Treatment options include different methods of surgery and/or re-irradiation with/without chemotherapy. Available information in the literature is grossly inadequate; most reports compose of small series of highly selected patients with heterogeneous characteristics and treatment. No randomized trials have been performed to evaluate the therapeutic ratio of different treatment methods. This article reviews available treatment options, their therapeutic benefits and risks of complications; the objective is to provide information for developing treatment recommendations and suggestions for future improvement. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|In {{patients}} who have persistently detectable viral loads while taking ART, tests {{can be done to}} investigate whether there is drug resistance. Most commonly a genotype is sequenced which can be compared with databases of other HIV viral genotypes and resistance profiles to predict response to therapy. If there is extensive resistance a phenotypic test of a patient's virus against a range of drug concentrations can be performed, but is expensive and can take several weeks, so genotypes are generally preferred. Using information from a genotype or phenotype, a regimen of 3 drugs from at least 2 classes is constructed that will have the highest probability of suppressing the virus. If a regimen cannot be constructed from recommended first line agents it is <b>termed</b> <b>salvage</b> therapy, and when 6 or more drugs are needed it is termed mega-HAART.|$|R
