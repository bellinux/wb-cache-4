In each case, the weight of the ungulate prey is similar to the average newborn weight for that respective species, and most ungulates taken are about the same weight as the eagle. The taking of larger ungulates is exceptional but has been verified in several cases, and is most likely to happen in late winter or early spring, when other available prey is scarce and (in most of the range) eagles are not concerned with carrying prey to a nest. In Scotland, golden eagles have been confirmed to kill red deer calves up to [...] in mass and have been captured on film attacking an adult red deer but not carrying through with the hunt. Both adult and kid chamois and ibex have been confirmed as prey and, in some cases, have been forced off cliff edges to fall to their deaths, after which they can be consumed.

Unsuccessful attacks on both adult mule and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have been recently filmed but there is only a single account that mentions predation on an adult white-tailed deer.

Logging for timber and charcoal production are the most prominent threats, but locals are also known to hunt the kipunji due to its crop-destroying habits or simply as a food source.

5000|$|Most accipitrids usually hunt prey rather {{smaller than}} themselves. However, many accipitrids {{of almost all}} sizes have been {{recorded}} as capturing and then flying with prey of equal weight or even slightly heavier than themselves in their talons, a feat that requires great physical strength. Occasionally, an eagle or other raptor that kills prey considerably heavier than itself (too heavy for the raptor to carry and fly with) will then have to leave prey where they've killed and later return repeatedly to feed or dismember {{and bring to a}} perch or nest piece by piece. This has the advantage of providing a surplus of food but has the disadvantage of potentially attracting scavengers or other predators which can steal the kill or even attack the feeding accipitrid. Using this method, accipitrids such as the golden (Aquila chrysaetos), wedge-tailed (Aquila rapax), martial (Polemaetus bellicosus) and crowned eagles (<b>Stephanoaetus</b> <b>coronatus)</b> have successfully hunted ungulates, such as deer and antelope, and other large mammals (kangaroos and emus in the wedge-tailed) weighing more than 30 kg (66 lb), 7-8 times their own mass. More typical prey for these powerful booted eagle species weigh between 0.5 and 5 kg.|$|E
50|$|The {{martial eagle}} {{can be found}} in most of sub-Saharan Africa, {{wherever}} food is abundant and the environment favourable. With a total estimated distribution of about 26000 km2, it is fairly widely distributed in the continent, having a somewhat broader range than species like the crowned eagle (<b>Stephanoaetus</b> <b>coronatus)</b> and the Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii). Although never common, greater population densities do exist in southern Africa and in some parts of east Africa. Martial eagles tend to be rare and irregular in west Africa but are known to reside in Senegal, The Gambia and northern Guinea-Bissau, southern Mali and the northern portions of Ivory Coast and Ghana. From southern Niger and eastern Nigeria the species is distributed spottily through Chad, Sudan and the Central African Republic as well as the northern, eastern, and southern portions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In east Africa, they range from northwestern Somalia and Ethiopia more or less continuously south through Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and in southern Africa from Angola, Zambia, Malawi and southern Mozambique to South Africa. Some of the larger remaining populations are known to persist in Zimbabwe and South Africa. Generally, these birds are more abundant in protected areas such as Kruger National Park and Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park in South Africa, or Etosha National Park in Namibia.|$|E
50|$|Wading birds, even {{large and}} {{relatively}} slow-moving types {{such as the}} goliath heron (Ardea goliath), tend to be highly cautious about avoiding deep water in crocodile occupied wetlands whereas cormorants and waterfowl forage over deeper water and are easier for crocodiles to ambush, with Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca) and spur-winged geese (Plectropterus gambensis) recorded as being taken largely while flightless due to molting their flight feathers. On the contrary, there are several records of them capturing wading birds. Guggisberg (1972) saw multiple cases of predation on marabou storks (Leptoptilos crumenifer) and around Lake Turkana several may frequent heronries to pick off fledglings. In one case, a crocodile was filmed capturing a striated heron (Butorides striata) in mid-flight. Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) {{are known to be}} grabbed while they dive for fish as are possibly African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) while crowned eagles (<b>Stephanoaetus</b> <b>coronatus)</b> have reportedly been ambushed on land at carrion. Crocodiles are occasionally successful in grabbing passerines such as weaver birds, including the abundant red-billed quelea (Quelea quelea), and swallows, having been observed to breach the water and {{in a matter of seconds}} sweep off a branch full of birds with remarkable success. Larger land birds, such as bustards, guineafowl, ground hornbills (Bucorvus sp.) and ostriches (Struthio camelus), may be taken when they come to water to drink but like most birds are seldom harassed and a minor part of the diet.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{than these}} rare cases, larger {{birds of prey}} such eagles are not usually harassed by Verreaux's eagle-owl and are more aptly viewed as competitors. In fact, the martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), in most regards the largest eagle in Africa, is {{sometimes}} regarded as the diurnal ecological equivalent of the Verreaux's eagle-owl. The martial eagle has rather similar habitat preferences to the eagle-owl and has a similarly broad, opportunistic diet. At roughly 4200 g in average body mass, the martial eagle is roughly twice as heavy so Verreaux's eagle-owl and takes correspondingly large prey, its average prey weight range being 1000 to 5000 g and the eagles are capable of exceptionally taking prey up to nearly nine times their own weight, whereas quantitatively most of the eagle-owls prey does not exceed 1000 to 1500 g. Verreaux's eagle-owl are likely to give martial eagles a respectful amount of space during daytime {{and there are no}} records of the two species harassing one another. Another particularly large and aggressive eagle, the crowned eagle (<b>Stephanoaetus</b> <b>coronatus),</b> is largely a forest-dweller and so is less directly a diurnal equivalent. There a single recorded instance of an immature crowned eagle being aggressively displaced at night by an adult Verreaux's eagle-owl when it happen to encroach on the eagle-owl's territory but without bloodshed and eagle-owls would do well to avoid the exceptionally powerful eagle. Taken together, the Verreaux's, the Shelley's and the cape eagle-owls could be seen as nocturnally replacing the eagle species of martial, crowned and Verreaux's eagles in the respective habitats of savanna, forest and rocky areas but their increasingly diminishing size in comparison to the diurnal eagles means that, generally speaking, less large-bodied prey is likely to be attacked. [...] Despite its place {{near the top of the}} nocturnal avian food chain, in 2013 a remote wildlife camera videotaped a black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) attacking and killing a Verreaux's eagle owl at a watering hole. Similar rare successful attacks on great horned owls and Eurasian eagle-owls by smaller red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have been reported but in these cases the owls were mysteriously grounded in the horned owl and distracted by nesting into too-easily accessed sea cliffs in the eagle-owl. More often foxes are prey rather than predators for northern Bubo owls. Given that the Verreaux's eagle-owl is surprisingly bold about coming to their ground to, among other things capture beetles, feed on prey too large to carry in flight or, as is likely the case in the jackal attack, drink water, it is possible that the jackal was simply able to ambush an incautious eagle-owl rather than a grounded one.|$|E
50|$|The main {{method of}} {{predation}} used on ungulates is the “low flight with sustained grip attack”, which can take between {{a few seconds}} to at least 15 minutes to kill the prey. In studies, the average estimated weight of ungulate prey found in golden eagle nests varied between 2.5 kg and 5 kg, depending on the location and species involved. In each case, the weight of the ungulate prey is similar to the average newborn weight for that respective species, and most ungulates taken are about the same weight as the eagle. The taking of larger ungulates is exceptional but has been verified in several cases, and is most likely to happen in late winter or early spring, when other available prey is scarce and (in most of the range) eagles are not concerned with carrying prey to a nest. In Scotland, golden eagles have been confirmed to kill red deer calves up to 20 kg in mass and have been captured on film attacking an adult red deer but not carrying through with the hunt.

At a Mongolian nest, an apparently live-caught, dismembered adult Mongolian gazelle was observed. Adult pronghorns weighing 27 to 32 kg have been successfully attacked and killed. Unsuccessful attacks on both adult mule and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have been recently filmed but there is only a single account that mentions predation on an adult white-tailed deer. Adult roe deer, being relatively modestly sized, are possibly taken with some regularity unlike adults of other deer species. A handful of confirmed attacks on relatively large sheep, exceptionally including healthy adults, estimated to weigh around 52 to 70 kg have occurred in Scotland. One study in Finland found reindeer calves, of an estimated average weight of 12 kg, were routinely killed. Adult female reindeer weighing 60 to 70 kg have been killed in three cases in central Norway.

Females of this race of weigh from 68 to 90 kg Few records of predation on domestic cattle are known but a detailed examination of calf remains has shown that golden eagles in New Mexico, mainly wintering migrants, killed 12 and injured 61 weighing from 41 to 114 kg from 1987 to 1989. No other living bird of prey has been verified to kill prey as heavy as this, although wedge-tailed, martial (Polemaetus bellicosus) and crowned eagles (<b>Stephanoaetus</b> <b>coronatus)</b> have been confirmed to kill prey estimated to weigh up to 50 kg, 37 kg and 30 kg, respectively.|$|E

There were, however,striking regularities in the patterning of the calls given {{in response to these}} stimuli and different call combinations were strongly associated with each of the two predator types.

In playback experiments, males responded to leopard growls exclusively with a series of pyows and to eagle shrieks predominantly with hacks.

40|$|The African Crowned Eagle, <b>Stephanoaetus</b> <b>coronatus,</b> {{is a large}} raptor with a {{particularly}} long breeding cycle, even considering its size (Newton 1979). The incubation period is 49 – 51 days, the nestling period is 104 – 115 days {{and the length of}} the post-fledging period is contentious and varies considerably within its distribution in Africa (Steyn 1982). In some regions where the bird breeds biennially, this period is up to 350 days (Brown and Amadon 1989, Shultz 2002), whereas in other regions the post-fledging period is shorter as pairs bred annually, even for nine years in succession (Vernon 1984). The reason for this discrepancy has been ascribed to environmental quality and seasonal variability, and differences in the main prey base, densities and mortalities between populations (Newton 1979, Jarvis et al. 1980, Steyn 1982, Vernon 1984, Boshoff et al. 1994, Shultz 2002).

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the species composition of prey caught in the forest, savanna and emerging habitats in which African Crowned Eagles <b>Stephanoaetus</b> <b>coronatus</b> breed in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. At the 17 nest sites, the remains of 195 prey individuals were collected. The five dominant prey species caught were Rock Hyrax Procavia capensis, Vervet Monkey Chlorocebus pygerythrus, Blue Duiker Philantomba monticola, Greater Canerat Thryonomys swinderianus and Bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus. All of these species respond positively to urban expansion. Only eagles that nested inside protected areas were recorded preying on domestic animals. In terms of biomass, Bushbuck was one of the dominant taxa, and the remains of an estimated 28. 8 kg Bushbuck ram was found under a nest. The surprisingly high proportion of Rock Hyraxes and low proportion of Vervet Monkeys caught in emerging habitat may indicate that African Crowned Eagles nesting in this habitat are adapting to a more specialised feeding strategy compared with those nesting in habitats that are more natural. Future studies should investigate how and why prey proliferates in emerging habitats and examine the association between land uses and the diet of African Crowned Eagles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{predation}} pressure put on primates by diurnal {{birds of}} prey differs greatly between continents. Africa and South America have specialist raptors (e. g. crowned hawk-eagle <b>Stephanoaetus</b> <b>coronatus</b> and harpy eagle Harpia harpyja) whereas in Asia the only such spe-cialist’s (Philippine eagle Pithecophaga jefferyi) distribu-tion is largely allopatric with primates. The almost universal absence of polyspecific groups in Asia (common in Africa and South America) may indicate reduced predation pres-sure. As such there is almost no information on predation pressures on primates in Asia by raptors. Here we report successful predation of a juvenile banded langur Presbytis femoralis (* 2 kg) by a changeable hawk-eagle Spizaetus cirrhatus. The troop that was attacked displayed no signs of being alarmed, and no calls were made before the event. We argue that in insular Southeast Asia, especially, large Spizaetus hawk-eagles (* 2 kg) are significant predators of arboreal colobines. Using data on the relative size of sym-patric Spizaetus hawk-eagles and colobines we make pre-dictions on where geographically we can expect the highest predation pressure (Thai–Malay Peninsula) and which col-obines are least (Nasalis larvatus, Trachypithecus auratus, P. thomasi) and most (P. femoralis, T. cristatus) affected...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} behavioural features of many forest primates are the loud calls given by the adult males. Early observational studies repeatedly postulated that these calls function in intragroup spacing or intergroup avoidance. More recent field experiments with Diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana) of Ta Forest, Ivory Coast, have clearly shown that loud male calls function as predator alarm calls because calls reliably (1) label different predator classes and (2) convey semantic information about the predator type present. Here, I test the alarm call hypothesis another primate, the Campbell’s monkey (C. campbelli). Like Diana monkeys, male Campbell’s monkeys produce conspicuous loud calls to crowned hawk eagles (<b>Stephanoaetus</b> <b>coronatus)</b> and leopards (Panthera pardus), two of their main predators. Playback experiments showed that monkeys responded to the predator category represented by the different playback stimuli, regardless of whether they consisted of (1) vocalisations of the actual predators (crowned hawk eagle shrieks or leopard growls), (2) alarm calls to crowned hawk eagles or leopards given by other male Campbell’s monkeys or (3) alarm calls to crowned hawk eagles or leopards given by sympatric male Diana monkeys. These experiments provide further evidence that non-human primates have evolved the cognitive capacity to produce and respond to referential labels for external events...|$|E

At least 12 taxa were identified at a forest nest, of which 92. 1 % were neonate/juvenile. Bovids and procaviids represented 73. 7 % and 19. 6 % {{of the diet}} respectively whilst Samango Monkey (Cercopithecus albogularis), a common forest species, represented only 1. 7 % of prey items.

40|$|Syntactic rules allow {{a speaker}} to combine signals with {{existing}} meanings {{to create an}} infinite number of new meanings. Even though combinatory rules have also been found in some animal communication systems, they have never been clearly linked to concurrent changes in meaning. The present field experiment indicates that wild Diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana, may comprehend the semantic changes caused by a combinatory rule present in the natural communication of another primate, the Campbell's monkey, C. campbelli. Campbell's males give acoustically distinct alarm calls to leopards, Panthera pardus, and crowned-hawk eagles, <b>Stephanoaetus</b> <b>coronatus,</b> and Diana monkeys respond to these calls with their own corresponding alarm calls. However, in less dangerous situations, Campbell's males emit a pair of low, resounding 'boom' calls before their alarm calls. Playbacks of boom-introduced Campbell's alarm calls no longer elicited alarm calls in Diana monkeys, indicating that the booms have affected the semantic specificity of the subsequent alarm calls. When the booms preceded the alarm calls of Diana monkeys, however, they were no longer effective as semantic modifiers, indicating that they are meaningful only in conjunction with Campbell's alarm calls. I discuss the implications of these findings for the evolution of syntactic abilities. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Black-casqued {{hornbills}} (Ceratogymna atrata) forage {{in small}} flocks {{in the tropical}} forests of West Africa, often {{in the vicinity of}} primate groups, including Diana and Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus diana, C. campbelli). Previous work has shown that these monkey species produce acoustically distinct alarm calls to crowned eagles (<b>Stephanoaetus</b> <b>coronatus)</b> and leopards (Panthera pardus), two of their main predators. Black-casqued hornbills are highly vulnerable to crowned eagles, but not leopards, suggesting that individuals may respond differently to these two predators. We analysed the vocal response of these birds to field playbacks conducted on different monkey species in Taï National Park, Ivory Coast. We tested six stimuli, three of which related to the presence of a crowned eagle (eagle shrieks, Diana and Campbell's eagle alarm calls) and three to the presence of a leopard (leopard growls, Diana and Campbell's leopard alarm calls). Results showed that hornbills consistently distinguished between eagle- and leopard-related stimuli, suggesting that birds attended to the predator class associated with the various stimuli. Second, within eagle-related stimuli, hornbills responded more strongly to the actual predator vocalizations than the associated alarm calls. One interpretation of these data is that birds were sensitive to the precision of information concerning the location of the eagle. We discuss these results in light of previous data on hornbill behaviour and cognitive capacities...|$|E
40|$|Guereza colobus monkeys, Colobus guereza, produce acoustically {{conspicuous}} vocalizations, the roars, {{in response}} to their main predators, leopards, Panthera pardus, and crowned eagles, <b>Stephanoaetus</b> <b>coronatus.</b> Roaring alarm utterances generally consist of the same basic call types but differ in overall structural composition. Leopards trigger roaring alarms containing many roaring sequences {{of only a few}} calls each, while eagles trigger few sequences with many calls each. To investigate whether conspecifics extract meaning from these structural differences, we played back leopard and eagle alarm call sequences and compared the monkeys’ responses in terms of their locomotor, gaze and vocal behaviour with their responses to the corresponding predator vocalizations. Locomotor responses did not differ between playback conditions; movement was always towards the simulated caller with no clear patterns in the vertical plane. Gaze direction, however, was highly predator specific. When hearing leopard-related stimuli, monkeys {{were significantly more likely to}} scan the area beneath them than when hearing eagle-related stimuli, which caused more scanning above. Vocal response rates to conspecific alarms were generally low but comparable with rates to the corresponding predators. If monkeys called, however, they produced the matching call sequences. Overall, our results showed that Guerezas discriminated between predator alarm call sequences produced by unfamiliar conspecifics and responded to them in predator-specific ways. Since the sequences were composed of the same basic call types, we concluded that the monkeys attended to the compositional aspects of these utterances...|$|E
40|$|Diurnal raptors have {{declined}} significantly in western Africa since the 1960 s. To evaluate {{the impact of}} traditional medicine and bushmeat trade on raptors, we examined carcasses offered at markets at 67 sites (1 – 80 stands per site) in 12 countries in western Africa during 1990 – 2013. Black kiteMilvus migransand hooded vulture Necrosyrtes monachus together accounted for 41 % of 2, 646 carcasses comprising 52 species. Twenty-seven percent of carcasses were of species categorized as Near Threatened, Vulnerable or Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Common species were traded more frequently than rarer species, as were species with frequent scavenging behaviour (vs non-scavenging), generalist or savannah habitat use (vs forest), and an Afrotropical (vs Palearctic) breeding range. Large Afrotropical vultures were recorded in the highest absolute and relative numbers in Nigeria, whereas in Central Africa, palm-nut vultures Gypohierax angolensis were the most abundant vulture species. Estimates based on data extrapolation indicated that within West Africa 73 % of carcasses were traded in Nigeria, 21 % in Benin and 5 % elsewhere. Offtake per annum in West Africa {{was estimated to be}} 975 – 1, 462 hooded vultures, 356 – 534 palm-nut vultures, 188 – 282 Rüppell's griffons Gyps rueppellii, 154 – 231 African white-backed vultures Gyps africanus, 143 – 214 lappet-faced vultures Torgos tracheliotos, and 40 – 60 crowned eagles <b>Stephanoaetus</b> <b>coronatus.</b> This represents a sizeable proportion of regional populations, suggesting that trade is likely to be contributing significantly to declines. Stronger commitment is needed, especially by governments in Nigeria and Benin, to halt the trade in threatened raptors and prevent their extirpation...|$|E
40|$|The interrelationships between species composition, resource-use and availability, {{breeding}} and competition were studied in two hill habitat raptor communities in a conserved reserve and an unprotected communal land in Zimbabwe in 1995 and 1996. The conserved Lonestar Study Area (LSA) and the unprotected Communal Land Study area (CLSA) had 38 and 31 raptor species, high and normal diversities {{for the area}} sizes respectively. An estimated 147 pairs of 21 raptor species bred in 40 km² in the LSA compared to only 26 pairs of 22 raptor species per 40 km² in the CLSA. Six species (African Hawk Eagle Hieraaetus spilogaster, Black Eagle Aquila verreauxii, Crowned Eagle <b>Stephanoaetus</b> <b>coronatus,</b> Little Banded Goshawk Accipiter badius, Barn Owl Tyto alba,and Barred Owl Glancidium capense made up 69 % of breeding raptors in the LSA, while African Hawk Eagles, Little Banded Goshawks, Barn Owls and Barred Owls made up 58 % of the breeding raptors in the CLSA. The abundance of Black, Crowned and African Hawk Eagles in the LSA was linked to abundant hyrax, Heterohyrax brucei and Procavia capensis and juvenile bushbuck Tragelaphus prey, and the high reproduction rates of Natal Francolin Francolinus natalensis (0. 7 per ha when not breeding). Little Banded Goshawk and Barn Owl abundances were linked {{to their ability to}} change prey preferences according to prey availability. A fairly high rate of breeding attempts by eagles in the LSA in both years (60 - 76 % of all pairs per year) was probably also linked to prey abundance, Most breeding failures were predator related, and were more common in areas of relatively low nesting densities indicating lower parental vigilance there. High eagle breeding densities were associated with small mean territory sizes in the LSA (7. 7 - 10. 7 km² for the main eagle species). Eagles in the LSA usually nested closer to another eagle species than a conspecific, resulting in regular distributions of nests and no territory overlap within species. Differences in daily flight activity of eagles in both study areas, and in the onset of breeding between LSA eagles probably reduced interspecific aggression. Interspecific competition food and nest sites amongst LSA eagles was possibly lessened by slight ditferences in resource selection. Raptor resources were mostly unaffected by human activities in either study area during the study period. Differences in the raptor communities were probably as a result of natural habitat differences. The CLSA raptors potentially face resource loss through forest clearing and hunting. An expansion of the present CAMPFIRE program will protect the CLSA raptors. ...|$|E
