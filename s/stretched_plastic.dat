40|$|High tunnels are {{a form of}} {{protected}} agriculture that aids in season extension by creating a favorable microclimate using trapped solar heat. Tunnel structure {{is similar to a}} simple greenhouse, usually comprised of <b>stretched</b> <b>plastic</b> over a large ribbed frame. High tunnels are used extensively around the world for the production of high value crops. In 2010, the USDA-NRCS initiated a high tunnel funding program that aided in the erection of 4, 500 new high tunnels across the U. S. in 2010 and 2011. As high tunnel use continues to rise, basic research is needed in this production system to investigate its effectiveness and begin developing specialized IPM solutions to pest-related problems. This study involved production of three crops: tomato, broccoli, and cucumber in three high tunnels as well as three comparison field plots over the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. Season extension, yield, and fruit quality (size and marketability) were compared among traditional field plots and three different production systems within the tunnels: traditional black plastic mulch, containerized soilless production, and rockwool; however, the rockwool system was quickly abandoned after several failed attempts to maintain plant quality. Season extension was the most dramatic for tomatoes—fruit was harvested in the high tunnels more than two months before the field. Tomato size was also larger in the tunnels and there was a greater percentage of marketable fruit compared to the field. Conversely yield was not significantly different between production systems in the tunnel and the field for tomatoes. There {{was no significant difference in}} the broccoli or cucumber size between the high tunnel and the field; however, high tunnel yield was significantly greater for cucumbers and broccoli. There was no significant difference in the cucumber marketability, but broccoli marketability was significantly higher in the field. The containerized soilless production within the tunnel showed no significant advantages [...] decreased yields, smaller fruit, and lower fruit marketability. Pest density was also compared between the high tunnel and the field. Greenhouse pests were more prevalent in the high tunnels throughout the season. Common field pests such as hornworms and cucumber beetles were not significantly different between the high tunnel and the field; however the crucifer caterpillar complex including imported cabbageworms, diamond back moths, and cabbage loopers was significantly denser within the high tunnels. Multiple insecticide treatments were made in the high tunnels for various pests throughout the season. These results show that pest density is not significantly different in high tunnels compared to the field—implementing integrated pest management techniques is necessary in high tunnels just as it is in the field; however components may need optimized for this specialized form of production. Further research should aid in developing IPM decision making protocols for high tunnel producers. ...|$|E

This manuscript version is made available under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] this paper a modified multiplicative decomposition of the right stretch tensor is proposed and used for finite deformation elastoplastic analysis of hardening materials. The total symmetric right stretch tensor is decomposed into a symmetric elastic stretch tensor and a non-symmetric plastic deformation tensor. The plastic deformation tensor is further decomposed into an orthogonal transformation and a symmetric <b>plastic</b> <b>stretch</b> tensor. This <b>plastic</b> <b>stretch</b> tensor and its corresponding Hencky's plastic strain measure are then used {{for the evolution of}} the plastic internal variables. Furthermore, a new evolution equation for the back stress tensor is introduced based on the Hencky plastic strain. The proposed constitutive model is integrated on the Lagrangian axis of the <b>plastic</b> <b>stretch</b> tensor and does not make reference to any objective rate of stress. The classic problem of simple shear is solved using the proposed model. Results obtained for the problem of simple shear are identical to those of the self-consistent Eulerian rate model based on the logarithmic rate of stress. Furthermore, extension of the proposed model to the mixed nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening behaviour is presented. The model is used to predict the nonlinear hardening behaviour of SUS 304 stainless steel under fixed end finite torsional loading. Results obtained are in good agreement with the available experimental results reported for this material under fixed end finite torsional loading...|$|R

First, a unified computing model, {{which can be used}} to simulate the behaviour of beams under four loading scenarios that involve fire and explosion or impact, is constructed. The proposed technique allows complete transparency of the influence of the various parameters on the structural behaviour. Second, the effects of load level on critical temperature are analyzed for various static and explosion load ratios. Two cases of explosion and fire loading sequences are compared, it is shown that the critical temperature of the beam subjected to fire followed by an explosion is lower than that of the beam subjected to an explosion followed by fire. The influence of temperature on the p–i diagram is investigated, an iso-damage surface is introduced to distinguish safe and unsafe regions. Third, the limiting temperature criteria are further examined. That is, the first and second limiting temperatures can be determined when the dimensional catenary force is equal to zero or to one, which corresponds to the bending or <b>stretching</b> <b>plastic</b> hinge, respectively.|$|R

Depth and presence of effective refuge were recorded for each trap. To assess size-related changes in microhabitat use individuals of each species were classified in three size classes. The three species preferentially used bottom positions in the water column, though this behaviour was more evident in the case of Iberian loach. While large Iberian loach remained active at night Andalusian toothcarp and sand smelt were strongly diurnal, especially larger individuals. The three species showed a clear ontogenetic change in microhabitat pre- ferences towards deeper waters. Small Andalusian toothcarp and medium-sized Iberian loach used deeper microhabitat in the presence of refuge. Large Andalusian toothcarp consistently preferred exposed microhabitat at any time. Andalusian toothcarp using refuge were smaller at any time, while Iberian loach followed this pattern only at night. The differential vulnerability of these species to different predators (aerial and aquatic; diurnal and nocturnal) could explain the observed patterns in microhabitat use. Fish tended to co-occur in microhabitats either due to habitat characteristics independently of species or due to species independently of habitat. Andalusian toothcarp segregated spatio-temporally from sand smelt and Iberian loach, but these species occurred independently of each other. According to these co-occurrence patterns, Andalusian toothcarp would be more sensitive than Iberian loach or sand smelt to interspecificPeer reviewe...|$|R
