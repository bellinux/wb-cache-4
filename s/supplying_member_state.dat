The OLAF (or Office Europen de Lutte Anti-Fraude) has been charged by the European Union with protecting the interests of the European Union, to fighting fraud, corruption and any other irregular activity, including misconduct within the European Institutions, in an accountable, transparent and cost-effective manner. OLAF achieves its mission by conducting, in full independence, internal and external investigations.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} recent reforms of tax-benefit systems and a preliminary assessment of their impact on financial incentives to work and on labour <b>supply.</b> Many <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> have introduced policies to “make work pay” and have targeted low-wage workers {{with the aim of}} increasing their takehome pay. The labour market improvements observed over recent years are a sign that structural reforms have started to pay off. The reduction of disincentives to work and to hire, especially for the low-skilled, embedded in tax and benefit systems, a greater link with activation policies and a stronger reliance on preventive and targeted active labour market policies (ALMPs), and widespread wage moderation are all factors that have contributed to the structural improvement in the functioning of labour markets. Yet, despite these improvements, in view of the ageing of the population and rapid technological change, more progress is needed to further increase and maintain high levels of employment and participation rates, especially among female and older workers, and to reduce structural unemployment. <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> should continue along the line of reforms followed so far. The Commission has stressed the importance of a comprehensive strategy of labour market reforms ("flexicurity") that shift the focus from protection on the job to insurance in the market. These reforms would enable workers to move more smoothly from declining to expanding activities, thus easing tensions in the adjustment process, while ensuring adequate income support and responding to potential anxieties among European citizens. ...|$|R

Employment of RSE’s is modelled as an error correction mechanism with R&D expenditure as the explanatory variable.

The monitoring mechanism provides a means whereby the Commission can monitor progress towards this target on the basis of annual emission inventories <b>supplied</b> by the <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and national programmes which set out emission trajectories and policy measures to limit CO 2 or to increase sinks. It also requires <b>member</b> <b>states</b> to report inventories of other greenhouse gases. Under the monitoring mechanism each <b>member</b> <b>state</b> reports its greenhouse gas emissions by the 31 st of July each year. By each reporting deadline <b>member</b> <b>states</b> should <b>supply</b> inventories based on provisional data for the previous year and final data for the year previous to that. The first submission of provisional inventories in 1995 should also include data for the base year 1990. A review will be carried out under the responsibility of the European Commission. This report is also written to comply with the obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The inventory is compatible with the reporting requirements under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It contains a greenhouse gas emissions inventory for the years 1993 and 1994, together with a short description of how the internationally adopted IPCC Guidelines have been applied in the Netherlands. Temperature corrected carbon dioxide emissions in 1993 and emissions of methane and nitrous oxide were slightly higher than 1990. A dip in the economic development especially in the chemical industry sector prevented a further growth in emissions. Provisional data for 1994 suggest a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions due to the prosperous economic developments.

The European Union (EU) has thus balanced its commitment to biofuels as one option for meeting its renewable energy targets with sustainability criteria for economic operators <b>supplying</b> biofuels to <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> Seven voluntary “EU sustainability schemes” were approved in July, 2011 {{as a means to}} verify compliance. While mandated sustainability criteria have a strong environmental focus, a number of these voluntary schemes have social sustainability as a significant component of the requirements put forward for achieving certification. As several of these voluntary schemes are incipient, thereby limiting evidence on their effectiveness in practice, this analysis is based on a comparative analysis of the substantive content or ‘scope’ of these schemes and the likely procedural effectiveness of the same. Findings show that while some schemes have considerable coverage of social sustainability concerns, poor coverage of some critical issues, the presence of schemes lacking any social sustainability requirements, and gaps in procedural rules are likely to undermine the likelihood that social sustainability is achieved through these schemes or the EU sustainability policies lending credibility to them...|$|R
40|$|The context Biomass {{for energy}} plays a {{significant}} role in the EU renewable energy picture, with bioenergy expected to remain a key strategy for both the near and long term. Although biomass <b>supplies</b> within EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> are substantial, it will nonetheless be necessary to import significant volumes of fuel pellets and other forms of biomass in order to meet ambitious EU renewable energy targets. Given that the impetus for a shift toward renewable fuels is concern over levels of atmospheric carbon, it is essential that efforts to reduce fossil fuel use in the EU lead to lower levels of atmospheric carbon and do not result in increased carbon emissions. It is also important that forest sustainability in biomass supply regions not be threatened. A number of studies have examined the carbon implications of energy production from forest biomass. Conclusions are wide ranging, from those that claim carbon emissions stemming from energy production from trees can be worse than when burning coal, to determinations that wood-based bioenergy offers large carbon mitigation benefits. Examination of such studies reveals that outcomes are very heavily dependent upon underlying assumptions – assumptions that are sometimes unrealistic. Objectives and focu...|$|R

40|$|The Russo-Ukrainian gas {{conflict}} was a prolonged dispute between Russia Ukraine on {{issues in the}} gas {{relations between the two}} countries. This conflict has caused several supply disruptions in the supplies to the EU. The supply disruption of 2009 was the most {{in the history of the}} EU. The goal of this thesis has been to analyze if this conflict, has caused a change in EU’s approach to energy security, from an internal market perspective, to a security of supply perspective. The focus of the existing literature is, to a great extent, independently on either energy security, the conflict itself or EU’s energy policy. This thesis contributes with an analysis of the effect of this particular conflict on EU’s approach to energy security, through five causal mechanisms. These five mechanisms are; “The New World of Oil”, the Eastern enlargement, the return of Russia on the international scene, Gazprom’s goal of global domination and the changes in the European utility industry. To analyze the effects, liberal intergovernmentalism has been applied as the theoretical framework which has guided the analytical process. Rather than to test the theory by this particular case, LI has been applied to derive empirical implications for the use in the analysis. These implications, in combination with the five mechanisms, have guided the analysis. The data has been based on EU documents, documents published by national governments, company reports, organizational reports, news articles and scholarly contributions Based on the findings, the conclusion is that there was a change in approach towards security if supply by the turn of the new millennium, as a consequence of the changes in the world’s oil market. The Russo-Ukrainian gas conflict reinforced this trend. Based on the findings, it seems that the conflict did not happen in a vacuum, as s stand-alone event. Rather it may be seen as symptomatic for the wider changes in the world’s energy markets. For some <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> the {{conflict was}} a wake-up call, as EU’s economic assumptions were challenged.
