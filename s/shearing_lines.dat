40|$|We {{applied the}} method of {{detecting}} gust fronts and <b>shear</b> <b>lines</b> to the detection of the vortex {{in order to develop}} a simple technique for automatically detecting vortexes with Doppler velocity data obtained from a single Doppler radar. We calculated the velocity gradient along the range directions and along the azimuthal directions. If we recognize the shear pattern from the Doppler velocity field, a vortex (its location of the center and horizontal extent) will be detected. The analyses are performed on the Doppler velocity data of the cyclonic and the anticyclonic vortex close to Chitose Airport, Hokkaido, Japan on 22 September 1988. Rotational orientation and size are calculated by the conventional method for the analyses of a vortex and compared with the analyses by the vortex detection method. The diameter of the cyclonic vortex near 2, 500 m in height remained about 10 km. Since we applied {{the method of}} detecting gust fronts and <b>shear</b> <b>lines</b> to this technique, the vortex and gust front (<b>shear</b> <b>line)</b> are detected at the same time. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{season was}} above average despite an El Niño, which {{typically}} suppresses tropical cyclogenesis in the Atlantic Ocean while increasing {{activity in the}} eastern Pacific Ocean. The Atlantic upper tropospheric <b>shear</b> <b>line,</b> a semi-permanent feature that extended southeastward into the Caribbean Sea, which enhances outflow from disturbances, remained persistent throughout the season. However, the opposite periphery of the <b>shear</b> <b>line</b> inhibits the divergent outflow of a disturbance.

Additionally, an abnormally strong mid-tropospheric ridge replaced the further south than normal westerlies that deterred tropical cyclone formation in 1968. Five hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall, causing 535 deaths and $1.49 billion in damage; Tropical Depression Twenty-Nine also resulted in damage.|$|R
40|$|During March 2013 {{a series}} of polar lows {{originated}} in a high-vorticity (> 10 − 3 s− 1) shear zone that {{was associated with a}} prolonged marine cold-air outbreak over the Norwegian Sea. A detailed analysis of one shear-line polar low at {{the leading edge of the}} outbreak is presented using comprehensive observations from a well-instrumented aircraft, dropsondes, scatterometer and CloudSat data; and numerical modelling output from a convection-resolving configuration of the Met Office Unified Model. The maximum low-level wind gradient across the <b>shear</b> <b>line</b> was 25 m s− 1 over 50 km. High windsto the north and west were within the cold-air mass and were associated with large surface turbulent heat fluxes and convective clouds. Low wind speed to the south and east of the <b>shear</b> <b>line</b> were associated with low heat fluxes and a clear ‘eye’ in the polarlow. Shear-line meso-γ-scale instabilities merging into the polar low appeared important to its structure and development. The model captured the <b>shear</b> <b>line</b> and the polar low structure very well — in particular the strength of the horizontal shear and the mesoscale thermodynamic fields. The spatialstructure of convective cloud bands around the polar low wassimulated reasonably well, but the modelsignificantly underestimated the liquid water content and height of the cloud layers compared to the observations. Shear-line polar lows are relatively common, however this case is arguably the first to be examined with a wide range of in-situ and remote observations allied with numerical model output...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, it is elucidated {{that the}} total {{deformation}} (TD), defined as the square root of the sum of squared stretching deformation and squared shearing deformation, is an invariant independent of the coordinate system used. An idealized flow field is then constructed to demonstrate the confluence effect of a non-divergent and irrotational deformation field on moisture transport. To explore the characteristics and role of TD, one heavy rainfall case {{that occurred in the}} middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MRYR) over China, associated with a front with <b>shear</b> <b>line,</b> is analyzed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model output data. It is found that right before the occurrence of precipitation, the effect of the confluence induced by deformation on moisture transport provides a favorable condition for precipitation. During the precipitation, both location and orientation of the zone of large TD coincide with the confluent <b>shear</b> <b>line.</b> The rainbands are nearly parallel with, and located lightly to the south of the zones of large TD and the confluent <b>shear</b> <b>line.</b> The TD in the lower troposphere increases in value as precipitation persists. When TD approaches its maximal value, the next 6 -hour precipitation reaches its peak correspondingly. A tendency equation for TD is derived. The analysis of linear correlation and RMS difference between individual terms in the total deformation equation and the sum of the terms shows that the pressure gradient {{plays a major role in}} determining the local change of total deformation.

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the {{interaction}} between midlatitude and subtropical systems are investigated using a case study and a potential vorticity (PV) framework. Our case study occurred on 25 November 2009; Jeddah and other regions in Western Saudi Arabia were hit by heavy rainstorms. The analysis of absolute, relative, and potential vorticity implies the significance of the lower level dynamics in the initiation of this case of cyclogenesis. The impact of the severe convective weather process caused more than 90 millimeters of rain to fall in Jeddah in just four hours. The analysis indicates that the heavy rainfall was due to the existence of an upper level cold trough in the Eastern Mediterranean and a warm blocking high situated over southeasternSaudi Arabiaand theArabian Sea. In addition, an evident low level <b>shear</b> <b>line</b> set up in the northwest of Jeddah, and the southeast movement of the <b>shear</b> <b>line</b> caused dynamic lifting and unstable energy release over Jeddah. The water vapor transport occurred primarily below 700 hPa, and a low level jet transported the water vapor from the Red Sea to centralSaudi Arabia.
