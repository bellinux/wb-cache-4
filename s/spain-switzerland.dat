25|$|At the 2010 World Cup, Webb {{refereed}} three games, {{all with}} Cann and Mullarkey as his assistants. In the group stage, he refereed the <b>Spain–Switzerland</b> and Slovakia–Italy games, {{and then took}} charge of the Brazil–Chile match in the Round of 16. In those three games, he never showed a red card or awarded a penalty, but he did issue the second highest number of yellow cards in the tournament, an average of 5.67 bookings per game. With fourteen yellow cards in the final (one red card to John Heitinga – twice yellow), he easily broke the previous record of six for most cards in a World Cup final, set in 1986. Nine of these Final yellow cards came in the first 90 minutes. Webb's total of 31 yellow cards throughout the tournament came to an average of 7.75 per game.|$|E
