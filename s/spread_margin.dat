40|$|Non-muscle cells express {{multiple}} myosin-II motor proteins myosin IIA, myosin IIB and myosin IIC transcribed {{from different}} loci {{in the human}} genome. Due to a significant homology in their sequences, these ubiquitously expressed myosin II motor proteins {{are believed to have}} overlapping cellular functions, but the mechanistic details are not elucidated. The present study uncovered a mechanism that coordinates the distinctly localized myosin IIA and myosin IIB with unexpected opposite mechanical roles in maneuvering lamellipodia extension, a critical step in the initiation of cell invasion, spreading, and migration. Myosin IIB motor protein by localizing at the front drives lamellipodia extension during cell spreading. On the other hand, myosin IIA localizes next to myosin IIB and attenuates or retracts lamellipodia extension. Myosin IIA and IIB increase cell adhesion by regulating focal contacts formation in the <b>spreading</b> <b>margins</b> and central part of the spreading cell, respectively. Spreading cells expressing both myosin IIA and myosin IIB motor proteins display an organized actin network consisting of retrograde filaments, arcs and central filaments attached to focal contacts. This organized actin network especially arcs and focal contacts formation in the <b>spreading</b> <b>margins</b> were lost in myosin IIA cells. Surprisingly, myosin IIB cells displayed long parallel actin filaments connected to focal contacts in the <b>spreading</b> <b>margins.</b> Thus, with different roles in the regulation of the actin network and focal contacts formation, both myosin IIA and IIB determine the fate of lamellipodia extension during cell spreading...|$|R

50|$|Fixed annuities {{offer some}} sort of {{guaranteed}} rate of return {{over the life of}} the contract. In general such contracts are often positioned to be somewhat like bank CDs and offer a rate of return competitive with those of CDs of similar time frames. Many fixed annuities, however, do not have a fixed rate of return {{over the life of the}} contract, offering instead a guaranteed minimum rate and a first year introductory rate. The rate after the first year is often an amount that may be set at the insurance company's discretion subject, however, to the minimum amount (typically 3%). There are usually some provisions in the contract to allow a percentage of the interest and/or principal to be withdrawn early and without penalty (usually the interest earned in a 12-month period or 10%), unlike most CDs. Fixed annuities normally become fully liquid depending on the surrender schedule or upon the owner's death. Most equity index annuities are properly categorized as fixed annuities and their performance is typically tied to a stock market index (usually the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average). These products are guaranteed but are not as easy to understand as standard fixed annuities as there are usually caps, <b>spreads,</b> <b>margins,</b> and crediting methods that can reduce returns.

40|$|There is {{abundant}} evidence in bacteriological literature {{to show that}} a species may exhibit temporary changes in morphology in response to environmental conditions. Thus, with spore-form-ing species, sporulation may be inhibited on certain media and at high temperatures; cultivation under conditions slightly in-jurious to the normal type of cell may result in unusual morpho-logical appearances; and peculiar forms in old cultures originally described as aberrant involution forms have frequently been shown to be capable of active reproduction, their unusual ap-pearance being attributed to the changed conditions of the old medium. Growth and multiplication therefore are not restricted to the morphological form typical of the species. An interesting change in morphology is shown by a strain of a spore-forming rod when grown at low temperatures, and this is accompanied by a complete change in the naked eye appearance of the growth on a solid medium. This organism appears in gram-stained preparations to be a typical member of the Bacillus genus, and the morphology at its optimum temperature of 300 C. has been described in a previous paper (Allen, Appleby and Wolf, 1939).

Data acquired from British Geological Survey borehole 94 / 3, on the Rockall High, provides a high-resolution record of post-rift, Early to Mid-Eocene, subaqueous fan-delta development and sporadic volcanic activity, represented by pillow lavas, tuffs and subaerial lavas. This sequence correlates with the East Rockall Wedge, which is one of several prograding sediment wedges identified across the Rockall Plateau whose development was largely terminated in the mid-Lutetian. Linking the biostratigraphical data with the magnetic anomaly pattern in the adjacent ocean basin indicates that this switch-off in fan-delta sedimentation and volcanism was coincident with the change from a segmented/transform margin to a continuously <b>spreading</b> <b>margin</b> during chron C 21. However, late-stage easterly prograding sediment wedges developed on the Hatton High during late Mid- to Late Eocene times; these can only have been sourced from the Hatton High, which was developing as an anticline during this interval. This deformation occurred in response to Mid- to Late Eocene compression along the ocean margin, possibly associated with the reorganisation to oblique spreading in the Iceland Basin, which culminated {{at the end of the}} Eocene with the formation of the North Hatton Anticline, and the deformation (tilting) of these wedges. A series of intra-Eocene unconformities, of which the mid-Lutetian unconformity is the best example, has been traced from the Rockall Plateau to the Faroe–Shetland region and onto the Greenland conjugate margin bordering the early ocean basin. Whilst there appears to be some correlation with 3 rd order changes in eustatic sea level, it is clear from this study that tectonomagmatic processes related to changes in spreading directions between Greenland and Eurasia, and/or mantle thermal perturbations cannot be discounted...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on mortgage pricing and to measure the GST shifting ratio of Australian credit unions. Design/methodology/approach - Using the proprietary data from 79 credit unions in Australia, we perform multivariate regression analysis on the effect of the GST on mortgage effective yield <b>spreads</b> and interest <b>margins,</b> respectively. We also introduce a model that is used to measure the GST shifting ratio. Findings - We document that the introduction of the GST in July 2000 led to the substantial rise in mortgage costs charged by credit unions in the post-GST periods. Overall, the GST alone contributed to the increase of effective yield <b>spreads</b> and interest <b>margin</b> by 65. 3 and 70. 1 basis points, respectively. As measured by the GST-shifting ratio, credit unions passed more than twice of the GST rate. This suggests GST over-shifting, and it is generally consistent with tax over-shifting literature. Originality/value - This is the first time the GST shifting ratio has been robustly measured with the use of multivariate models on mortgage costs.
