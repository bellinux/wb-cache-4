50|$|The Autographic Register was {{an advance}} over use of {{separate}} forms and carbon paper as it guaranteed that the copy {{was made and}} kept the forms in relative alignment. A number of advancements were soon made, {{including the use of}} <b>sprocket-fed</b> paper, invented by Theodore Schirmer. This helped avoid slippage and misalignment of forms, allowing more copies to be produced simultaneously. In 1912 Schirmer founded the Standard Register Company in Dayton, Ohio.|$|E
50|$|Mattel {{produced}} an automatic firing cap weapon styled after the Thompson submachine gun. Pulling {{back on a}} slide, which simulated the charging handle of the real Thompson, prepared the gun for firing by tensioning a spring. When the trigger was pulled the spring power would drive the mechanism, firing a series of up to ten caps from a <b>sprocket-fed</b> roll. It was made initially for a Dick Tracy line of toys, then camouflaged for a Green Beret Guerilla Fighter line of weapons, then restyled again as a tie-in with the Planet of the Apes franchise.|$|E
