5|$|Singers {{and players}} admired Britten's conducting, and David Webster rated it highly enough {{to offer him}} the musical {{directorship}} of the Covent Garden Opera in 1952. Britten declined; he was not confident of his ability as a conductor and was reluctant to <b>spend</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time performing rather than composing. As a conductor, Britten's repertory included Purcell, Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Schubert, and occasional less characteristic choices including Schumann's Scenes from Goethe's Faust; Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius and Introduction and Allegro; Holst's Egdon Heath and short pieces by Percy Grainger.|$|E
5|$|Youth <b>spend</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant {{from what the}} youth may already know. The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This {{is followed by a}} period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E

25|$|The United Kingdom {{insisted on}} special {{status as a}} longstanding belligerent during the war, {{concerned}} {{that if it were}} treated equally with the devastated continental powers it would receive virtually no aid. The Americans were pushing the importance of free trade and European unity to form a bulwark against communism. The Truman administration, represented by William L. Clayton, promised the Europeans that they would be free to structure the plan themselves, but the administration also reminded the Europeans that implementation depended on the plan's passage through Congress. A majority of Congress members were committed to free trade and European integration, and were hesitant to <b>spend</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of the money on Germany. However, before the Marshall Plan was in effect, France, Austria, and Italy needed immediate aid. On December 17, 1947, the United States agreed to give $40 million to France, Austria, China, and Italy.|$|E
25|$|Soloveitchik's four step {{scholarly}} {{approach to}} learning has influenced many of his students. The approach {{can be traced back}} to the approach of the Gaon of Vilna. The first step is concentrating on the text. This follows the Vilna Gaon's approach of carefully amending the texts of both exoteric (the Talmud) and esoteric works (for instance, the Torat Kohanim, Tosefta, Avot de-Rabbi Natan, etc.). The second step is knowing the physical reality of the objects described. Third is the conceptual analysis proffered by Rishonim. At this point he introduces an important distinction between Rishonim, which are primary sources, and must be mastered, even if one has to struggle to understand them; and Achronim, which are secondary sources, which can be exploited (if you find good material, use it, but if you don't understand it, don't <b>spend</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time on it). The fourth and final step is sevarah, creating the intellectual framework underpinning the Torah.|$|E

2500|$|Gibson {{returned}} to baseball in 1981 after accepting a coaching job with Joe Torre, {{who was then}} manager of the New York Mets. Torre termed Gibson's position [...] "attitude coach", the first such title in Major League history. After Torre and his coaching staff were let go {{at the end of}} the 1981 season, Torre moved on to manage the Atlanta Braves in 1982, hiring Gibson as a pitching coach. The Braves proceeded to challenge for the National League pennant for the first time since 1969, ultimately losing to the Cardinals in the 1982 National League Championship Series. Gibson remained with Torre on the Braves' coaching staff until the end of the 1984 season. Gibson then took to hosting a pre- and postgame show for Cardinals baseball games on radio station KMOX from 1985 until 1989. Gibson also served as color commentator for baseball games on ESPN in 1990 but declined an option to continue the position over concerns he would have to <b>spend</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time away from his family. [...] In 1995, Gibson again served as pitching coach on a Torre-led staff, this time returning to the Cardinals.

2500|$|Another plan {{proposed}} by RTA in 1978 {{called for a}} 1.5-mile extension of the Green Line east to Interstate 271 along with exit ramps from the interstate highway to a 1,500-car parking garage attached to a new station. [...] The cost {{of the project was}} estimated at $29 million. [...] The proposal was assailed almost immediately by various elements in the community. [...] The Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency complained that the project would primarily benefit the more affluent parts of the community while its cost would be borne by residents of the entire county. [...] There were also arguments that the extension would only serve a low-population-density area, although the park-and-ride connection with the interstate highway provided a potential for increased ridership from throughout the eastern suburbs. [...] Ultimately, the RTA Board of Trustees voted unanimously that any extension of the Shaker Rapid Transit would be made only after improvements were made in other corridors to the southeast and the southwest and after a downtown distributor system was built. [...] The Board's refusal to commit funds for the extension was undoubtedly made because it had already announced plans to rebuild the entire Shaker Rapid Transit system, and it was unwise to <b>spend</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of its capital resources on just one segment of a county-wide transit system.|$|E
