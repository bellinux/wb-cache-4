40|$|The {{structural}} and electronic properties of Cu segregation in aluminum are {{studied in the}} framework of the density functional theory, within the projector augmented plane-wave method and both its local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA). We first studied Al–Cu interactions in bulk phase at low copper concentration (≤ 3. 12 %: at). We conclude to a tendency to the formation of a solid solution at T= 0 K. We moreover investigated surface alloy properties for varying compositions of a Cu doped Al layer in the (111) Al surface then buried in an (111) Al slab. Calculated segregation energies show unstable systems when Cu atoms are in the surface position (position 1). In the absence of ordering effects for Cu atoms in a layer (xCu= 1 / 9 and xCu= 1 / 3), the system is more stable when the doped layer is buried one layer under the surface (position 2), whereas for xCu= 1 / 2 to xCu= 1 (full monolayer), the doped layer is more accommodated when buried in the sub-sub-surface (position 3). First stage formation of GP 1 - and GP 2 -zones was finally modeled by doping (100) Al layers with Cu clusters in a (111) Al slab, in the surface then buried one and two layers under the surface. These multilayer clusters are more stable when buried one layer beneath the surface. Systems modeling GP 1 -zones are more stable than systems modeling GP 2 -zones. However the segregation of a full copper (100) monolayer in an (100) Al matrix shows a copper segregation deep in the bulk with a <b>segregation</b> <b>barrier.</b> Our results fit clearly into a picture of energetics and geometrical properties dominated by preferential tendency to Cu clustering close to the (111) Al surface...|$|E

Theory: The study builds on the theoretical framework by Acker (1990, 2006, 2012), who argues that seemingly gender-neutral organizations in fact are based on institutionalized gendered norms, embedded into the organizations’ structures and hierarchies. These gendered norms are based on the image of the ‘ideal-worker’ being a male as it builds on stereotypical masculine traits, and thus such structures contribute to the reproduction of gender inequality. Method: The study has been conducted by using a qualitative research design, collecting data based on 21 semi-structured interviews with females working in IT-professions. Result: The results confirm that the IT-sector is indeed based upon such stereotypical masculine traits as proposed by Acker, and that the perceived ideal-worker is constructed as male. Masculine skills and abilities are understood as so-called ‘tough skills’, while women are perceived as having ‘softer’ skill-sets. These gendered structures and assumptions create barriers for women both in- and outside the sector. As women are unable to identify with the ideal IT-worker concept, females are also less likely to opt for a career within IT. For the women who remain and work in the male-dominated IT industry, results further confirm that women unable to identify with the ideal-male worker also tend to detach from the stereotypicall...|$|R

We adhere to a policy of <b>segregation</b> and <b>barrier</b> nursing to manage patients with MRSA, and we actively pursue eradication of MRSA. We have evaluated our experiences of MRSA infection in our large adult CF centre. MethodA retrospective review of all MRSA-positive patients from 1998 to 2008 was undertaken. Isolates were subjected to molecular identification to elucidate possible patient-to-patient transmission events. Eradication attempts were scrutinised. ResultsWe have maintained a low incidence and prevalence (below 3 %) of MRSA within this large cohort. A total of 15 pulsotypes of MRSA were identified among the 24 isolates examined, epidemiological data suggested no patient–patient transmission. Based on 6 month follow-up data, successful eradication was achieved in 81 % patients. This includes those who had harboured infection for some time. Twenty-one (80. 8 %) required only one course of treatment, 3 (11. 6 %) patients required two different regimes and 2 (7. 5 %) required three courses to fully eradicate the organism. ConclusionStrict infection control procedures can control MRSA infection and keep the prevalence low in CF clinics. Eradication is achievable {{in the majority of}} patients even when significant time has lapsed from initial isolation.

40|$|Multiple-objective {{optimization}} {{is common}} in biological systems. In the mammalian olfactory system, each sensory neuron stochastically expresses {{only one out of}} up to thousands of olfactory receptor (OR) gene alleles; at organism level the types of expressed ORs need to be maximized. Existing models focus only on monoallele activation, and cannot explain recent observations in mutants, especially the reduced global diversity of expressed ORs in G 9 a/GLP knockouts. In this work we integrated existing information on OR expression, and constructed a comprehensive model that has all its components based on physical interactions. Analyzing the model reveals an evolutionarily optimized three-layer regulation mechanism, which includes zonal <b>segregation,</b> epigenetic <b>barrier</b> crossing coupled to a negative feedback loop that mechanistically differs from previous theoretical proposals, and a previously unidentified enhancer competition step. This model not only recapitulates monoallelic OR expression, but also elucidates how the olfactory system maximizes and maintains the diversity of OR expression, and has multiple predictions validated by existing experimental results. Through making analogy to a physical system with thermally activated barrier crossing and comparative reverse engineering analyses, the study reveals that the olfactory receptor selection system is optimally designed, and particularly underscores cooperativity and synergy as a general design principle for multi-objective optimization in biology.

Design/Methodology/ Approach: This study was conducted using qualitative face-to-face interviews. The interviews were conducted using only female participants, {{all of whom were}} over the age of 18 and gave written consent. A sample size of 7 was obtained across different positions of the organisational hierarchy and responsibility levels in order to gain a wide response. Findings: The research concludes that there are several cultural and industry barriers which exist and have a direct effect on the progression of women into positions of the managerial hierarchy within the Scottish banking and financial sector. Limitations: There were several limitations identified by the researcher prior to, and during the course of {{this research}}. Firstly access to participants became difficult, as the initial contact identified within the industry had an increased workload at the time of the research and was unable to aid with the identification of prospective participants. Secondly face-toface interviewing technique became difficult to implement due to the time constraints of the participants, therefore interviews had to be adapted to fit with the schedules of participants resulting in some being completed via e-mail.

Analysis on eight contiguous, vertical cliff-faces comprising both depositional-dip- and -strike-oriented segments provides field-validation and calibration of entire range of fluvial heterogeneity, where: 1) large-scale heterogeneity (10 ’s of m vertically and 100 ’s of m laterally) is associated with stacking of channelized fluvial sandbodies encased within coastal-plain fines, 2) intermediate-scale heterogeneity (1 ’s of m vertically and 10 ’s of m laterally) is related to type and distribution of architectural elements like bar-accretion and crevasse-splay units within individual sandbodies, and 3) small-scale heterogeneity (10 ’s of cm vertically and 1 ’s of m laterally) is attributed to facies spatial variability within individual architectural elements. At a reservoir-scale (∼ 6 km strike-transect), impact of these heterogeneities has resulted in potential stratigraphic compartmentalization in varied patterns and scales within and among three zones, which have similar lateral extents. Distinct vertical or lateral compartmentalization, contrasting net-to-gross pattern, width-constraint by either large- or intermediate-scale heterogeneity, disparity in communication between principal reservoir compartments by intermediate-scale heterogeneity, and reservoir-quality <b>segregation</b> to <b>barrier</b> styles rendered by small-scale heterogeneity are documented in an array of trends. These intriguing trends are challenging to correlate across the reservoir-scale dataset, contributing to multiple, analogous exploration and production uncertainties.

Gender based pay discrimination is small in the public sector. In contrast, it is quite high by international comparisons in the private sector and mainly takes place by paying a pure rent premium to men estimated at about 82 % of female pay, with a large proportion (35 % of female pay) attributable to <b>segregation</b> or entry <b>barriers</b> facing females in certain occupations. Quantile regression methods were further used to examine the distribution of wage premia across occupations and wage quantiles. The results show that public sector wage premia exist only at the lower level of the wage distribution and gender-based pay discrimination is highest in the private sector for the low wage quantiles of unskilled workers and higher wage groups in technical and managerial positions.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 61 - 67). The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the use of health care services and the barriers to access among low-income Latinas living in San Diego, California. Data were collected from nine focus groups with 46 participants. The Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations (BMVP) provided the theoretical framework for the study. Participants had a mean age of 32. 56 (SD 6. 5), 86 % reported Latino descent, 76. 1 % had no health insurance and 48. 8 % reported monthly incomes of less than $ 2000. Participants shared their experiences accessing and using health care services. As suggested by the BMVP, themes were organized into four categories: (1) Predisposing factors, (2) Enabling factors, (3) Need factors, and (4) Outcomes. A fifth category was added based on the literature and data to capture those methods used to maintain health despite limited resources, (5) Strategies to maintain health. The five themes were each subcategorized into positive and negative. The "positive" components included the predisposing, enabling, need factors and outcomes that encourage Latinas to seek health care services and the "negative" components were those factors that prevent or discourage Latinas from seeking health care services. The two categories from the BMVP with the most important constructs and themes for this study were the predisposing and enabling factors. In addition, the category of strategies to maintain health was important in understanding the practices used to access care and maintain health in the absence of resources. Participants identified immigration status, health beliefs, family, language and literacy, and gender as predisposing factors that influenced utilization of health care services. The most commonly mentioned enabling factors functioned negatively and prevented access to care. These included health insurance, cost of health care, perceived barriers to care, discrimination, and case managers. The strategies used to maintain health for both participants and their families included public programs, mobile clinics and health fairs, and home remedies. The findings support many of the constructs within the BMVP and suggest new ones that apply to low-income Latinas in San Diego. This study reveals that there are structural barriers to care, such as institutional racism, residential <b>segregation,</b> administrative <b>barriers,</b> and lack of access for those with few resources. Furthermore, this study provides suggestions for health care providers and those seeking to improve the health of low-income Latino populations...|$|R

40|$|Abridged) The {{observed}} {{presence of}} pure CO 2 ice in protostellar envelopes {{is attributed to}} thermally induced ice segregation, but a lack of quantitative experimental data has prevented its use as a temperature probe. Quantitative segregation studies are also needed to characterize diffusion in ices, which underpins all ice dynamics and ice chemistry. This study aims to quantify the <b>segregation</b> mechanism and <b>barriers</b> in different H 2 O:CO 2 and H 2 O:CO ice mixtures covering a range of astrophysically relevant ice thicknesses and mixture ratios. The ices are deposited at 16 - 50 K under (ultra-) high vacuum conditions. Segregation is then monitored at 23 - 70 K {{as a function of}} time, through infrared spectroscopy. Thin (8 - 37 ML) H 2 O:CO 2 /CO ice mixtures segregate sequentially through surface processes, followed by an order of magnitude slower bulk diffusion. Thicker ices (> 100 ML) segregate through a fast bulk process. The thick ices must therefore be either more porous or segregate through a different mechanism, e. g. a phase transition. The segregation dynamics of thin ices are reproduced qualitatively in Monte Carlo simulations of surface hopping and pair swapping. The experimentally determined surface-segregation rates for all mixture ratios follow the Ahrrenius law with a barrier of 1080 [190] K for H 2 O:CO 2 and 300 [100] K for H 2 O:CO mixtures. During low-mass star formation H 2 O:CO 2 segregation will be important already at 30 [5] K. Both surface and bulk segregation is proposed to be a general feature of ice mixtures when the average bond strengths of the mixture constituents in pure ice exceeds the average bond strength in the ice mixture.

40|$|Today, {{state of}} the art MOSFETs feature {{effective}} gate lengths of only a few tens of nanometers pushing the conventional MOSFET electronics towards nanoelectronics. The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) predicts the 18 nm node for the year 2018, that requires a physical gate length of 7 nm or less. It has been widely accepted that the path for the next decades is going to be far more demanding. This includes the introduction of new device concepts (e. g. nanowire or FinFETs), complex material engineering (e. g. III-V, strain engineering) and handling the variability of devices (e. g. random dopant fluctuation, line-edge roughness) as channels approach atomic scales. This thesis investigates the application of NWs as an alternative to conventional planar MOSFETs. For this the following imminent physical and material challenges are examined: i) fabrication and characterization of multi-gate MOSFETs employing top-down fabricated Si nanowire arrays, ii) adaption of strained Si as a high mobility channel material for NW-array MOSFETs, iii) the implementation of Ni silicide S/D contacts for reduced contact resistance and improved carrier injection and iv) transport of charges in single Si NWs during Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy. The multi-gate device architecture is an innovative transistor concept which includes double-gate MOSFETs, Fin-field effect transistors (FinFETs), -gated MOSFETs and gate-all-around MOSFETs. They represent a potential solution to the ongoing reduction of gate length and lower power supply in today's devices. Most of these devices are adapted on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates. By taking a closer look it is shown that {{it is not only the}} intrinsic smallness what makes a nanowire such an appealing and versatile structure, but also its very good electrostatic control of the gate. In order to further improve carrier mobility and by that the drive current, NW-array n-MOSFETs were fabricated on biaxially tensile strained SOI substrates. Lateral strain relaxation through patterning is employed to transform biaxial tensile strain into uniaxial tensile strain along and NWs. Similarly to the unstrained devices I-V characterization yields excellent electrostatic behavior of the devices. It was found that o_-currents of the NW array MOSFETs were independent on the channel orientation and the strain within channel. Low temperature I-V characterization of strained and unstrained NW array n-MOSFETs, at temperatures ranging from 4 K to 280 K, were performed. The inverse subthreshold swing, S(T), follows the theoretical predicted behavior perfectly. An increase of threshold voltage, Vth(T), with decreasing temperature was observed for strained and unstrained devices, respectively. Nickel-silicide contacts unite low extrinsic resistance and, in combination with dopant <b>segregation,</b> low Schottky <b>barrier</b> heights. For NWs, the silicidation speed decreases with increasing NW cross section, but no difference in silicidation speed of strained and unstrained SOI NWs was found. The results indicate volume diffusion of the silicide along the NWs during the silicidation process. Contact resistivities and the resistivities of doped Si NWs are presented as a function of As+ and BF 2 ion implantation dose and cross sectional area of NWs. Strained silicon NWs show lower resistivity for all doping concentrations due to their enhanced electron mobility compared to the unstrained case. Furthermore, Nickel silicide contacts were successfully implemented in NW-array p-MOSFETs. The silicidation of NWs suffered from a strong variation of the silicide segments in length. The fabricated devices showed ambipolar transfer characteristics, which is explained by a hybrid transistor type that includes conventional and SB-MOSFETs within one NW array, due to the variability of the silicided segment lengths. By introducing NiSi the S/D resistance was reduced compared to conventional NW-array p-MOSFETs. NiSi contacts showed an orientation dependence, resulting in lower S/D resistance for NWs compared to. As a consequence NW p-MOSFETs with channels featured drive currents higher than. Kelvin probe force microscopy is successfully applied to investigate unimplanted top-down fabricated Si NWs. The investigations focus on the question of how transport of majority carriers to the measurement position determines the probed KPFM bias. Measurements on implanted Si pads and unimplanted NWs show a correlation of the probed KPFM bias with the transport of majority carriers from the Al contact via the Si pad and into the Si NW. The built-in potential is successfully verified via the probed KPFM bias for equal-type doped junctions, and with the inversion-energy for different-type doping junctions. Additionally, the structural influence on the probed KPFM bias due to expanded vertical asymmetric electric dipoles is discussed...|$|R
