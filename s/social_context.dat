40|$|Despite {{the huge}} {{prospects}} of pervasive social computing and the extensive work in context-aware applications, so far very limited work {{has focused on}} socially-aware applications. The key requirements to develop such applications are modeling, managing and reasoning about users' <b>social</b> <b>contexts.</b> To fulfil these requirements, in this PhD research, we have made an attempt to model, manage and reason about <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> to aid the development of socially-aware applications. We study different types of <b>social</b> <b>contexts,</b> their use in various socially-aware applications and possible sources to acquire such <b>social</b> <b>contexts.</b> We will investigate existing context modeling and reasoning techniques and will propose an approach to modeling and reasoning about different types of <b>social</b> <b>contexts.</b> To aid the development of socially aware applications, we will provide a middleware platform for managing the acquisition, changes and provision of <b>social</b> <b>contexts...</b>|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, the {{implementation}} of marine protected areas (MPAs) offers opportunities for delivering fisheries and biodiversity management objectives. In Australia however, the primary function of an MPA is that of biodiversity conservation. Nonetheless, the management of Indigenous customary fisheries is one area where fisheries and biodiversity issues converge. This article examines the relationship between biodiversity and customary fisheries in an MPA context by investigation of the role and importance of Indigenous <b>social</b> <b>contexts.</b> Using case study examples from Australia, I explore the role of Indigenous <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> in two dimensions: (i) management of traditional fisheries and (ii) Indigenous contribution to fisheries within an MPA. Findings demonstrate two narratives concerning <b>social</b> <b>contexts,</b> one of recognition and the other concerning Indigenous involvement in management. I conclude with a survey of Indigenous management initiatives within MPAs. The article ends {{with a discussion of}} the utility of understanding <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> in any marine management endeavour, specifically other <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> within an MPA.

This repetition, a stylistic tool that resembles baroque writings, constructs a cyclical pattern in the novel which depicts the author's social views.

5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} ash particles. Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure, the concentration of ash in the air and the respirable ash fraction; the proportion of ash with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. The <b>social</b> <b>context</b> may also be important.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} question; {{what is the}} {{significance}} that a cross-section of New Zealand graphic designers placed on using knowledge of <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> to inform their practice? It reveals whether graphic designers in the research, drew on knowledge of <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> that arose from implicit knowledge, whether they relied on dedicated research to locate knowledge of <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> {{and the extent to}} which that knowledge of <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> was significant to their practice. The theoretical framework for the research was primarily based on Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts of habitus, social structure and practice, to find the degree to which knowledge of <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> came out of either a conscious process of enhancing cultural capital in designers’ day-to-day practice, or from dispositions inculcated over designers’ lifetimes through habitus at various levels. Bourdieu’s sociological perspectives are particularly applicable to this research, because of the way in which he places great emphasis on cultural knowledge as the basis of cultural investigation. The ethnographic research modelled on Bourdieu’s methods, in which empirical studies are essential to theoretical research, used conversation analysis in which the reflexivity of the interviewer contributed strongly to the collection of data. The research method was based on a series of seven case studies conducted with New Zealand graphic designers of varying backgrounds and working situations, between 2002 and 2003. The research investigated how they had acquired knowledge of <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> for practice and the importance that they placed on bringing this knowledge into their practice. The research group ranged from recent graduates to senior and accomplished graphic designers. Graphic designers showed the significance of knowing about <b>social</b> <b>contexts,</b> through the cultural capital that was important to their practice and to their positions in the graphic design field. This research has highlighted the difficulty that designers encountered, to varying degrees, in identifying how knowledge of <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> came into their practice or even how they had acquired this knowledge. Knowledge of <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> was shown to be derived from designers’ own social structures and the durable dispositions and practice relative to their background, from the habitus of the internal culture of a designer's firm, from within the wider field of graphic design practice and the changing dispositions arising from it and finally, from graphic designers’ external social worlds. This research suggests that contextual knowledge also needs to be brought into the teaching of graphic design, rather than being seen to arise implicitly in conceptualisation and studio practice...|$|R

5|$|In {{the stories}} he narrates, the Baron is shown as a calm, {{rational}} man, describing what he experiences with simple objectivity; absurd happenings elicit, at most, mild surprise from him, and he shows serious doubt about any unlikely events {{he has not}} witnessed himself. The resulting narrative effect is an ironic tone, encouraging skepticism in the reader and marked by a running undercurrent of subtle social satire. In addition to his fearlessness when hunting and fighting, he is suggested to be a debonair, polite gentleman given to moments of , with a scholarly penchant for knowledge, {{a tendency to be}} pedantically accurate about details in his stories, and a deep appreciation for food and drink of all kinds. The Baron also provides a solid geographical and <b>social</b> <b>context</b> for his narratives, peppering them with topical allusions and satire about recent events; indeed, many of the references in Raspe's original text are to historical incidents in the real-life Münchhausen's military career.|$|E
5|$|Alternative rock {{is a broad}} {{umbrella}} term {{consisting of}} music that differs greatly {{in terms of its}} sound, its <b>social</b> <b>context,</b> and its regional roots. By the end of the 1980s magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock, helping to define a number of distinct styles (and music scenes) such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and alternative hip hop. Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands representing them, such as Hüsker Dü and R.E.M., had even signed to major labels. But most alternative bands' commercial success was limited in comparison to other genres of rock and pop music at the time, and most acts remained signed to independent labels and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became successful.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Onora O'Neill, {{who studied}} under John Rawls at ￼Harvard University, is a {{contemporary}} Kantian ethicist who supports a Kantian approach {{to issues of}} social justice. O'Neill argues that a successful Kantian account of social justice must not rely on any unwarranted idealizations or assumption. She notes that philosophers have previously charged Kant with idealizing humans as autonomous beings, without any <b>social</b> <b>context</b> or life goals, though maintains that Kant's ethics can be read without such an idealization. O'Neill prefers Kant's conception of reason as practical and available {{to be used by}} humans, rather than as principles attached to every human being. Conceiving of reason as a tool to make decisions with means that the only thing able to restrain the principles we adopt is that they could be adopted by all. If we cannot will that everyone adopts a certain principle, then we cannot give them reasons to adopt it. To use reason, and to reason with other people, we must reject those principles that cannot be universally adopted. In this way, O'Neill reached Kant's formulation of universalisability without adopting an idealistic view of human autonomy. This model of universalisability does not require that we adopt all universalisable principles, but merely prohibits us from adopting those that are not.|$|E

40|$|Recently, <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> {{have been}} used with {{promising}} outcomes in developing social aware applications in different fields. However, a user's social information is distributed over different OSN, which is a challenge for developers wishing to collect this information.

This framework {{has the ability to}} acquire raw <b>social</b> <b>contexts</b> from Facebook; an ontology-based model designed for classifying, inferring, and storing <b>social</b> <b>contexts,</b> as a proof-of-concept. In addition, CommonFriends application has been developed that connects with the framework through API to notify users when any of the following scenarios happen: finding common friends, notifying the user of their distance from their friends, when they are within the same location, and suggesting a new friend with common interests. These features will demonstrates the applicability of the research approach. The performance of the mobile application has been evaluated using tester accounts under Facebook's testing environment...|$|R
