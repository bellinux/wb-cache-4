5000|$|The <b>short-tailed</b> <b>hawk</b> (Buteo brachyurus) is an American {{bird of prey}} in {{the family}} Accipitridae, which also {{includes}} the eagles and Old World vultures. As {{a member of the}} genus Buteo, it is not a true hawk and thus also referred to as a [...] "buteo" [...] or (outside North America) [...] "buzzard". The white-throated hawk (B. albigula) is a close relative and was formerly included in the species B. brachyurus.|$|E
50|$|The white-throated hawk is {{a rather}} small Buteo, 42 - 45 cm long. It lives in the Andes {{mountains}} of South America and ranges down to the coast in the O'Higgins region of Chile, preferring wooded areas. It {{is closely related to}} the more widely distributed <b>short-tailed</b> <b>hawk,</b> and was formerly considered conspecific with it. The white-throated hawk differs in having a longer tail and no dark morph. It also shows plumage differences such as brown streaks on the breast and belly, and a blackish tail with barely visible darker bands.|$|E
5000|$|Data demonstrating which species prey on Bachman's sparrow are lacking. However <b>short-tailed</b> <b>hawks</b> (Buteo brachyurus) 48 and {{possibly}} American kestrels (Falco sparverius) [...] prey on adult Bachman's sparrows. Species responsible for nest predation are not generally known. Evidence in two studies suggest mammalian predators. and snakes eat Bachman's sparrow nestlings.|$|R
50|$|Virtually all of North America's raptors take adult {{or young}} red-winged blackbirds, even barn owls, which usually only take small mammals, and {{northern}} saw-whet owls, which are scarcely {{larger than a}} male red-winged. Accipiter hawks are among their most prolific predators and, locally, {{they are one of}} the preferred prey species of <b>short-tailed</b> <b>hawks.</b> Crows, ravens, magpies and herons are occasionally predators of blackbird nests. Additional predators of blackbirds of all ages and their eggs include raccoons, mink, foxes and snakes, especially the rat snake. Marsh wrens destroy the eggs, at least sometimes drinking from them, and peck the nestlings to death.|$|R
500|$|The {{sheltered}} open {{waters of}} the bay and the outlying chain of keys provide resting areas for migrating birds on their way between North American, the Caribbean islands, and South America. Many southbound land birds stop in the fall at Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, {{just north of the}} park on Key Biscayne, before venturing across the open waters of Biscayne Bay. [...] Northbound spring migrants do likewise on Elliott Key. Most of the small passerine migrants are warblers, with ovenbirds, palm warblers, American redstarts, common yellowthroats, prairie warblers, worm-eating warblers and black-throated blue warblers accounting for the majority. Migrant raptors include <b>short-tailed</b> <b>hawks,</b> sharp-shinned hawks, merlins, peregrine falcons and swallow-tailed kites, while bald eagles and ospreys nest in the park. Both white-tailed and red-tailed tropicbirds are seen in the park, as are American flamingos, with some of the latter probably escaped captive birds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>short-tailed</b> <b>hawk</b> is {{uncommon}} {{and local}} {{in most of}} its range. It is quite difficult to detect unless in flight, since it is often concealed while perched by dense canopy or with only the head showing (unlike most Buteo hawks which generally prefer prominent perches). Due {{to the fact that}} it is believed to be regularly overlooked in the field, no comprehensive population surveys have occurred for the species. However, due to its wide extent of occurrence, it is not considered threatened by the IUCN. Sightings of soaring short-tailed hawks are fairly frequent within their range.|$|E
50|$|The {{large stick}} nest is {{built in a}} tree, at a height ranging from 2.5 to 30 m. In Florida, the bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) is a popular nesting tree of the <b>short-tailed</b> <b>hawk.</b> The nest is bulky, {{measuring}} 60 - 70 cm wide and 30 cm deep. Its 1-3 eggs per clutch are white, usually with dark spots and blotches. The nesting season is January through June in Florida and is possibly similar in the tropics. Incubation occurs over 34 days with no known details of their fledgling period. In Florida, American crows {{have been known to}} consume eggs of this species.|$|E
50|$|Short-tailed hawks {{breed in}} the {{tropical}} and subtropical Americas from southeastern Brazil and northern Argentina north through Central America to the mountains of the Mexico-Arizona border area, {{as well as in}} southern Florida, United States. This species is generally found below 4500 ft ASL and most common below 2500 ft. It is replaced by the white-throated hawk (B. albigula) in the Andes of southern Colombia and south to central Argentina and Chile; the <b>short-tailed</b> <b>hawk</b> is found in the Cordillera Central and Cordillera Occidental of Colombia, while B. albigula occurs south of these locales. As far as is known, B. brachyurus is a year-round resident except that most of the Florida population migrates in winter to the southern tip of the state, including the Keys. It is somewhat habitat adaptable but only passes areas with dense human populations when foraging. The species may be found in wooded savannah, patchy woodlands near water, cypress swamps, mangrove swamps or high pine-oak woodlands. In the tropics, it is most common in lowland foothills.|$|E
50|$|Painted {{buntings}} {{are mostly}} monogamous and are solitary or in pairs during the breeding season, but sometimes exhibit polygyny. The breeding season begins in late April and lasts through to early August, with activity peaking mid-May through to mid-July. The male arrives {{about a week}} before the female and starts to establish a small territory. The nest is typically hidden in low, dense vegetation and is built by the females and woven into the surrounding vegetation for strength. Each brood contains three or four gray-white eggs, often spotted with brown, which are incubated for around 10 days until the altricial young are hatched. The female alone cares for the young. The hatchlings are brooded for approximately 12 to 14 days and then fledge at that time. About 30 days after the first eggs hatch, the female painted bunting usually lays a second brood. Nests are often parasitized by cowbirds. Common predators at the nest of eggs, young, and brooding females are large snakes, including coachwhip snakes, eastern kingsnakes, eastern racers and black rat snakes. Bird-hunting raptors, including <b>short-tailed</b> <b>hawks,</b> Accipiter hawks, and even the small passerine loggerhead shrike, may hunt painted buntings, including the conspicuous breeding-plumaged male. The painted bunting can live to over 10 years of age, though most wild buntings probably live barely half that long.|$|R
50|$|The {{broad-winged hawk}} is a {{relatively}} small Buteo, with a body size from 32 to 44 cm in length and weighing anywhere from 265 to 560 g. The tail is relatively short, measuring 14.5 - 19 cm in length. The tarsus measures from 5.6 to 6.6 cm. As in most raptors, females are slightly larger than males. Broad-winged hawks have relatively short and broad wings, pointed at the end, which have a tapered appearance unique to the species. The wingspan can range from 74 to 100 cm, with the extended wing bone (standard measurement) measuring 22.7 - 30 cm. Adults' bodies are a dark brown with a white belly and chest containing horizontal barring. Their tail can be a dark grey-black with white lines along the middle, base and tip. The young hawks have a slightly different colouring with more white and longitudinal barring instead of horizontal barring. There {{are two types of}} colouration: a dark morph with fewer white areas and a light morph that is more pale overall. The light morph of this bird is most likely {{to be confused with the}} red-shouldered hawk, but they have a longer, more heavily barred tail and wings with a solid rufous colour in the adult which are usually distinctive. Rare dark morphs are a darker brown on both upperparts and underparts. Dark-morph <b>short-tailed</b> <b>hawks</b> are similar but are whitish under the tail with a single subterminal band.|$|R
50|$|Florida scrub jays {{are one of}} the few {{cooperative}} {{breeding birds}} in North America. Fledgling Florida scrub jays remain in their parents' habitat for several years and help to rear young, watch for predators (such as <b>short-tailed</b> or Accipiter <b>hawks),</b> and defend territory against neighboring Florida scrub jay family groups. These families can range in size from 2 to 8.|$|R
5000|$|In Florida, it eats mainly smaller birds. The <b>short-tailed</b> <b>hawk</b> hunts from soaring flight, {{often at}} the borders between wooded and open areas. A {{frequent}} maneuver is [...] "kiting" [...] - coming to a stop, the bird heads into the wind, with its wings held stationary. It typically attacks prey with a nearly vertical swoop, sometimes pausing and then continuing downward in a [...] "stair-step" [...] manner. Typical prey ranges from a New World warbler (Parulidae) to a bobwhite (Colinus) in size. In Florida, icterids—namely the red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), the common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula), the boat-tailed grackle (Quiscalus major) and the eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna)—make {{up the bulk of}} the prey. In one case, 95% of a single hawk's prey selection was found to consist of red-winged blackbirds. Hunting success is apparently relatively low. In one study, 30 hours of observation showed that only 12 of 107 hunting attempts (or around 11%) were successfully. There are isolated records of short-tails preying on sharp-shinned hawks (Accipiter striatus) and American kestrels (Falco sparverius). Among tropical populations, they are several records of this species regularly taking frogs (especially tree frogs), lizards, large insects such as wasps and locusts. Such prey, which serves merely as alternate foods for Florida populations, apparently provides a much larger proportion of the diet in tropical populations. In all parts of the range, they occasionally supplement their diet with smallish mammals, principally small rodents such as mice, rats and bats. Among the heaviest prey recorded are young common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and similar small monkeys; these do not seem to form an important prey item however, and are only snatched when the opportunity presents itself. They are primarily an aerial predator, taking most prey by swooping down to trees or the ground. Rarely, they have been recorded still hunting from a perch.|$|E
5000|$|All Buteo {{species are}} {{to some extent}} {{opportunistic}} {{when it comes to}} hunting, and prey on almost any type of small animal as it becomes available to them. However, most have a strong preference for small mammals, mostly rodents. Rodents of almost every family in the world are somewhere preyed upon by Buteo species. Since many rodents are primarily nocturnal, most buteos mainly hunt rodents that may be partially active during the day, which can include squirrels and chipmunks, voles, and gerbils. More nocturnal varieties are hunted opportunistically and may be to be caught in the first or last few hours of light. Other smallish mammals, such as shrews, moles, pikas, bats, and weasels, tend to be minor secondary prey, although can locally be significant for individual species. Larger mammals, such as rabbits, hares, and marmots, including even adult specimens weighing as much as 2 to 3 kg, may be hunted by the heaviest and strongest species, such as ferruginous, red-tailed and white-tailed hawks. Birds are taken occasionally, as well. Small to mid-sized birds, i.e. passerines, woodpeckers, waterfowl, pigeons, and gamebirds, are most often taken. However, since the adults of most smaller birds can successfully outmaneuver and evade buteos in flight, much avian prey is taken in the nestling or fledgling stages or adult birds if they are previously injured. An exception is the <b>short-tailed</b> <b>hawk,</b> which is a relatively small and agile species and is locally a small bird-hunting specialist. Other prey may include snakes, lizards, frogs, salamanders, fish, and even various invertebrates, especially beetles. In several Buteo species found in more tropical regions, such as the roadside hawk or gray-lined hawk, reptiles and amphibians may come to locally dominate the diet. Swainson's hawk, despite its somewhat large size, is something of exceptional insect-feeding specialist and may rely almost fully on crickets and dragonflies when wintering in southern South America. Carrion is eaten occasionally by most species, but is almost always secondary to live prey. The importance of carrion in the Old World [...] "buzzard" [...] species is relatively higher since these often seem slower and less active predators than their equivalents in the Americas. Most Buteo species seem to prefer to ambush prey by pouncing down to the ground directly from a perch. The secondary approach in many is that prey is spotted from a great distance while soaring and is set down upon while circling down to the ground.|$|E
30|$|The {{abundance}} {{recorded with}} the roadside point transect method (9.38 ind[*]·[*][10  km 2] − 1 [*]·[*]h− 1) was around 2.5 {{times higher than}} that recorded with the roadside strip transect method (3.55 ind[*]·[*][10  km 2] − 1 [*]·[*]h− 1) (p[*]=[*] 0.05) (Table  1). All species showed higher abundances when surveyed by roadside point transects than roadside strip transects (Table  1). Results for the ordinary abundance (number of individuals/transect) were similar in both cases. All but four species (Roadside Hawk, <b>Short-tailed</b> <b>Hawk,</b> Yellow-headed Caracara, and American Kestrel) had higher ordinary abundances recorded on roadside point transects (Table  1).|$|E
30|$|The {{coastal plain}} and altitudinal grasslands {{supported}} quite different raptor assemblages. Although the regions exhibited similar richness values, most species were more abundant on the altitudinal grasslands. Relief, habitat availability, anthropogenic occupation, {{and the level}} of disturbance differ between these regions, and species-habitat relationships could explain differences in assemblage compositions (Zilio et al. 2012). On altitudinal grasslands, patches of natural grassland are surrounded by forest remnants, resulting in a mosaic-like landscape. Hence, the assemblage included both forest raptors and large grassland raptors (Petersen et al. 2011; Zilio et al. 2012). Half of the species recorded only on the altitudinal grasslands, the King Vulture and <b>Short-tailed</b> <b>Hawk,</b> are typically associated with forests, while the other two, the Crowned Eagle and Black-chested Buzzard-eagle, are characterized as open-woodland and grassland species (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In contrast, raptors related to wet habitats (e.g., marshes, swamps, and rice fields) were more common on the coastal plain (Albuquerque et al. 1986; Zilio et al. 2012). For example, the Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture and Snail Kite inhabit wet savannahs, marshes, and rice fields (Belton 1984; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). These two species were only recorded on the coastal plain.|$|E
