5000|$|... “Some {{political}} {{gay rights}} activists and “fundamentalists” are {{skeptical about the}} way the idea and the ball are turned into a lifestyle and are diluted, but nobody speaks up to voice criticism.” Gery Keszler is well aware of the delicate balancing act between the fun factor, which in turn attracts people and companies, creates publicity and, eventually, collects as much in donations as possible, and the message to be conveyed. For instance, only journalists who have reported not only about celebrities but also about HIV and AIDS are accredited again. Sometimes it is criticized+ that by now also certain conservative and/or right-wing politicians show up as guests or announce to attend the Ball. Keszler believes that a ball against discrimination should not discriminate against anyone. If these people manage to <b>secure</b> <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> and believe they would enjoy the event, they will certainly not be stopped from attending it. And Keszler regards their potential plan of ganging up and making “all well” again as naïve.|$|E

Entry was not encouraged by the government, and in fact no foreigners were permitted. This {{made it all the}} more appealing to him, and by trickery he <b>secured</b> <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> for passage on a government boat, with professors en route there to service the small educational system the Japanese maintained on the island. His exploration of this region permitted him to record on film some of the rites of the tribes of headhunters still living in the remote mountain areas. This seven-month effort produced a remarkable film shown at the Explorers Club. The visit also permitted him to <b>secure</b> <b>a</b> collection of treasured artifacts relating to the lives of these people and produced a lecture series on the subject.|$|R

Like most of his teammates, he had problems at the batting plate, as {{he was unable to}} hit for consistency during the pool rounds, though he had a crucial RBI single equalizer against Chinese Taipei {{in the bottom of the}} 8th of that game. Sakamoto seems to regain his batting sense alongside his teammates in the 16-4 mulling of the Netherlands that qualifies Team Japan to the semi-finals, hitting 2-5 in the game including a grand slam in the top of the 7th that gave Japan a more than 10 run lead needed to end the game early via mercy rule, <b>securing</b> <b>an</b> early <b>ticket</b> to the semis. Unfortunately, they lost their semi-final match against Puerto Rico 3-1, thus finishing third and losing their two-time defending championship streak.|$|R

W 3 C XML Protocol Working Group {{has been developing}} standard techniques such as Web Services Description Language (WSDL), simple object access protocol (SOAP), universal description discovery and integration (UDDI). However, at this stage, there is no standard technique for access control in M-services. This paper describes <b>a</b> <b>secure</b> and flexible access control scheme and protocol for M-services based on role based access control (RBAC). The access control architecture involves a Trusted Credential Center (TCC), a Trusted Authentication and Registration Center (TARC) and <b>a</b> <b>secure</b> <b>ticket</b> based mechanism for service access. Users and service providers register with the TARC and are authenticated. Based on this, tickets are issued by the TCC to users. Tickets carry authorization information needed for the requested services. In particular, {{we are able to}} specify access control polices based on roles. The protocols between the various entities in the model are protected using appropriate security mechanisms such as signatures which are used to verify correctness of the requested service, as well as to direct billing information to the appropriate user. Our architecture supports efficient authentication of users and service providers over different domains and provides <b>a</b> <b>secure</b> access model for services to users. Our model is also able to support anonymity of users. Only the TARC is able to identify misbehaving users. We believe that the proposed architecture forms a good basis for achieving <b>a</b> <b>secure</b> and flexible M-service system...|$|R
