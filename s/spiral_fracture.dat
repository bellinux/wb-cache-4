25|$|Bone {{fracture}}s, {{such as a}} toddler's fracture (<b>spiral</b> <b>fracture</b> of the shin bone), {{can also}} cause pain and limp, but are uncommon around the hip joint. Soft tissue injuries can be evident when bruises are present. Muscle or ligament injuries can be contracted during heavy physical activity —however, {{it is important not}} to miss a slipped upper femoral epiphysis. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease) typically occurs in children aged 4–8, and is also more common in boys. There may be an effusion on ultrasound, similar to transient synovitis.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Spiral</b> <b>{{fractures}}</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} common fractures seen in nonaccidental injury. With radiographic evidence for the mechanism of injury, the physician is more capable of identifying any inconsistencies in the history. OBJECTIVES: To detail and differentiate the fracture patterns created by rotation forces in different directions. To determine the reliability of that recognition method applied to standard radiographs. METHODS: Twenty rabbit femurs were fractured using a torque transducer and imaged using standard anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs. The ability of pediatric, orthopaedic, emergency department, and radiology doctors to correctly predict the mechanism of force required to produce the fracture was assessed before and after being given the findings of this study. RESULTS: The radiographic propagation of the <b>spiral</b> <b>fractures</b> was consistent and followed 6 simple principles. There was a statistically significant difference in the numbers of correctly diagnosed radiographs by these doctors before and after the explanation of our findings (chi 2 = 14. 06; df = 1; P = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: The direction of the torsional force producing <b>spiral</b> <b>fractures</b> can be determined from characteristic features on routine anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs. Determining the direction of the torsional force on radiographs does not always seem to be intuitive. These derived 6 principles will be a useful aid to physicians who manage pediatric <b>spiral</b> <b>fractures</b> where nonaccidental injury is being considered...|$|R
50|$|During the 1930s, the Kandahar binding was introduced, {{which could}} be locked down at the heel for the {{downhill}} portions. The Kandahar remained in widespread use until the 1960s. As more skiers took up the sport, especially in the 1950s, broken legs became common. Dr. Richard Spademan saw 150 <b>spiral</b> <b>fractures</b> pass through his emergency department near Squaw Valley in three days, an event {{that led to the}} development of the Spademan binding. By the early 1950s, several safety bindings were on the market that allowed the ski to come off when the ski twisted to the side. This helped reduce the incidence of <b>spiral</b> <b>fractures.</b>|$|R

50|$|Humerus {{fractures}} usually occur after physical trauma, falls, excess physical stress, or pathological conditions. Proximal humerus fractures {{most often}} occur among elderly patients with osteoporosis who fall on an outstretched arm. Less frequently, proximal fractures occur from motor vehicle accidents, gunshots, and violent muscle contractions from an electric shock or seizure. Other {{risk factors for}} proximal fractures include having a low bone mineral density, having impaired vision and balance, and tobacco smoking. A stress fracture of the proximal and shaft regions can occur after an excessive amount of throwing, such as pitching in baseball. Middle fractures are usually caused by either physical trauma or falls. Physical trauma to the humerus shaft tends to produce transverse fractures whereas falls tend to produce <b>spiral</b> <b>fractures.</b> Metastatic breast cancer may also cause fractures in the humerus shaft. Long <b>spiral</b> <b>fractures</b> of the shaft that are present in children may indicate physical abuse. Distal fractures usually occur {{as a result of}} physical trauma to the elbow region. If the elbow is bent during the trauma, then the olecranon is driven upward, producing a T- or Y-shaped fracture or displacing one of the condyles. Falls that produce humerus fractures among the elderly are usually accompanied by a preexisting risk factor for bone fracture, such as osteoporosis, a low bone density, or vitamin B deficiency.|$|R

5000|$|Fractures of the humerus are {{classified}} {{based on the}} location of the fracture and then by the type of fracture. There are three locations that humerus fractures occur: at the proximal location, which is the top of the humerus near the shoulder, in the middle, which is at the shaft of the humerus, and the distal location, which is the bottom of the humerus near the elbow. Proximal fractures {{are classified}} into one of four types of fractures based on the displacement of the greater tubercle, the lesser tubercle, the surgical neck, and the anatomical neck, which are the four parts of the proximal humerus, with fracture displacement being defined as at least one centimeter of separation or an angulation greater than 45 degrees. One-part fractures involve no displacement of any parts of the humerus, two-part fractures have one part displaced relative to the other three; three-part fractures have two displaced fragments, and four-part fractures have all fragments displaced from each other. Fractures of the humerus shaft are subdivided into transverse <b>fractures,</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>fractures,</b> [...] "butterfly" [...] fractures, which are a combination of transverse and <b>spiral</b> <b>fractures,</b> and pathological fractures, which are fractures caused by medical conditions. Distal fractures are split between supracondylar fractures, which are transverse fractures above the two condyles {{at the bottom of the}} humerus, and intercondylar fractures, which involve a T- or Y-shaped fracture that splits the condyles.|$|R

30|$|Pierce et al. [7] {{have the}} only series {{currently}} published that examines {{the incidence of}} femur fractures and falls down stairs. Their series evaluated femur fractures that were due to a reported fall down stairs (either solo or in a caretaker’s arms), and evaluated a plausibility model to check whether they could identify cases of nonaccidental trauma. In their subgroup of caretaker falls, this mechanism most commonly caused buckle fractures, followed by transverse/short oblique fractures. They examined the energy absorbed by the patients during falls and noted that the greater number of stairs in the fall correlated to the fracture pattern type, noting that <b>spiral</b> <b>fractures</b> were associated with falls from 1 to 3 steps and buckle fractures with falls from 4 to 15 steps. In our study, we saw an even distribution of <b>spiral</b> and buckle <b>fractures</b> that {{may be associated with}} the variability in fall heights that were observed in our patient population.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Twenty-one {{patients}} with fractures {{of the bones}} of the hand were treated by open reduction and internal fixation with compression screws. The firm fixation allowed range-of-motion exercises in most pa tients to be begun on the third postoperative day. On follow-up mild restriction in digital motion was seen in only one patient, and significant disturbance in joint function was not encountered. In spite of these advan tages, the method is indicated in only a small percen tage of such fractures. Usually traditional methods of open reduction and internal fixation are preferred when an open procedure is needed. However, oblique and <b>spiral</b> <b>fractures</b> of the proximal phalanx, some fractures with large single articular fragments particu laxly involving the proximal interphalangeal joint, an...|$|R
50|$|The {{major problem}} with these {{bindings}} is {{they did not}} release {{in the case of}} an accident. In particular, if the forward tip of the ski rotated to the side, the force was transmitted through the length of the ski to the boot, forming a huge moment arm. Even small forces could produce torques able to break the ankle or knee, and <b>spiral</b> <b>fractures</b> of the calf were common. This was not as much of an issue in cross-country where the heel was relatively free to move, but in downhill use when the cable was clipped down this was a serious concern. In the 1950s it was estimated that a skier had a 1% chance of suffering an injury on any given day, and that 10% of skiers would suffer a fracture over a single season.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: First, to {{evaluate}} humeral fracture patterns created by torque and transverse force, {{to test the}} breaking force required and evaluate maximum force applied by volunteers; second, to apply {{the results of these}} experiments and review relevant literature to three clinical cases of <b>spiral</b> humeral shaft <b>fracture</b> during police arrest with contradicting statements of the involved persons. Material and Methods: The study consisted of {{a review of the literature}} as well as an experimental model study. Controlled torque force and direct force was applied to a set of artificial and human humerus bones. In addition, maximum force was measured in 33 healthy volunteers. Fracture thresholds were compared using t-test. Results: Torque forces result in <b>spiral</b> <b>fractures,</b> direct force results in transverse fractures of both artificial and human bones. The threshold level for fractures was significantly lower in human bones than in artificial bones. Maximum force was higher in male than in female volunteers. Nevertheless, all volunteers achieved sufficient force to fracture both artificial and human bones. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that the humerus fracture in all three clinical cases occurred as a result of torque forces to the arm. Since there were no lesions to the adjacent joints (shoulder, elbow), the injury mechanism concurs with the situation of a resisted arrest. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
