Homer pulls them to safety just in time, and he is suddenly filled with a new reason to live: to place a <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> at the dangerous intersection. After successfully petitioning the city council, Homer embarks on a public safety crusade that involves placing speed bumps and warning signs throughout the town.|$|E
5|$|WSDOT is {{studying}} several different proposed {{changes to the}} SR224 / SR225 intersection to improve traffic flow. Several proposals have been introduced to alleviate the situation, including replacing the <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> at the intersection with a traffic light, reconfiguring the intersection and the off ramp from I-82, and implementing several options featuring roundabouts. WSDOT favors the roundabout options and estimates costs will range between $2 and $7.4million to construct.|$|E

5|$|At {{the western}} end of the tunnel, Highway58 emerges as a divided highway in Thorold. It meets an {{interchange}} with Pine Street; the eastbound on-ramp from Pine Street features a <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> and no merging lane prior to entering the Thorold Tunnel. West of Pine Street, the route passes beneath a Trillium Railway line and curves slightly southwest. It encounters an interchange with Collier Street, gradually curving to the northwest and passing beneath Richmond Street. Highway58 ends at a complicated interchange with both St. Davids Road as well as Highway406 {{on the edge of the}} Niagara Escarpment.|$|E
5|$|SR 11 {{continues}} {{north toward}} Ashtabula, meeting interchanges for SR 82 and an access {{road to the}} Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport. Urban areas transition back into rural areas here. It later intersects SR 305 and SR 5 at diamond interchanges near Cortland. The route then enters Ashtabula County, and travels in a straight line, passing through US 322, a rest area, US 6, and SR 307. Mostly forests and fields are between the highway. The route slowly bends northwest, and meets I-90 at a cloverleaf interchange. The route crosses over Ashtabula River, and bypasses Ashtabula. It ends at SR 531, part of the Lake Erie Circle Tour, at a <b>stop</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E

2500|$|More recently, Georgia Traffic Engineer Martin Bretherton Jr. {{reviewed}} over 70 {{technical papers}} {{to find that}} multi-way <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> do not typically control traffic speeds, and can create a variety of problems, including liability issues, traffic noise, pollution, enforcement problems and poor stop compliance when drivers feel that the signs have no justification. Fifteen studies found that unwarranted multi-way stops actually increased speed away from intersections as motorists try to make up lost time spent at [...] "unnecessary" [...] <b>stop</b> <b>signs.</b> Multi-way <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> impose high vehicle operating costs, longer than needed travel times, excessive fuel consumption and increased vehicle emissions.|$|R
5|$|Mulder goes {{to visit}} Madame Zirinka again, who {{tells him that}} the planets come into {{alignment}} like this only once every 84 years, and additional alignments will cause anyone born on January 12, 1979 (Margi and Terri's birthdate) {{to have all the}} energy in the cosmos focused on them. Margi goes to see Scott alone but an angry Terri arrives. The two argue with each other and end up accidentally killing Scott. Margi goes to Mulder, telling him that Terri is responsible for the murders, while Terri goes to see Scully and tells her the opposite. The agents call each other and bring both girls to the police station, where the place starts shaking and all the guns go off on their own. Mulder locks the girls in a room together and their power goes away once the clock ticks midnight. When the town mob and Detective White finally see Terri and Margi as the culprits, Spitz claims it was the work of Satan, oblivious to the cosmic alignment's energy. Mulder and Scully drive home, arguing again over directions; when Scully defiantly runs a <b>stop</b> <b>sign,</b> Mulder notifies her but she tells him to shut up, which he does.|$|E
25|$|The already-widespread {{use of the}} MUTCD <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> {{became law}} in the United States in 1966. In 1968, this sign {{was adopted by the}} Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals as part of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's effort to {{standardize}} road travel across borders. The Convention specifies that 'stop' be written in English or the national language and allows an alternative circular yellow sign. Many European countries are party to the Convention. English-speaking countries, the exception being India, are not party to the Convention but usually use the red octagonal <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> per their own standards, like the MUTCD. Even in countries not associated with either standard mentioned above, the red octagonal <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> is often used. Unique types of stop signs may still be observed in countries like Japan.|$|E

25|$|A <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> is {{a traffic}} sign, usually erected at road {{junctions}} {{such as a}} four-way intersection, that instructs drivers to stop and then to proceed only if the way ahead is clear. The idea of placing stop signs at road junctions was first conceived in 1890 when William Phelps Eno of Saugatuck, Connecticut proposed and devised {{the first set of}} traffic laws in an article published in Rider and Driver. However, the first use of stop signs did not appear until 1915 when officials in Detroit, Michigan installed a <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> with black letters on a white background. Throughout the years and with many alterations made to the <b>stop</b> <b>sign,</b> the current version with white block-lettering on a red background that is used in the United States as well as emulated in many other countries around the world today, did not come into use until the Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted the design in 1975.|$|E
25|$|About 5:38am EST, while {{operating}} the motorcoach southbound in a left-hand HOV lane of I-75 in the Atlanta metropolitan area, the driver accidentally entered a left exit ramp, which ended abruptly at an elevated T-junction {{marked by a}} <b>stop</b> <b>sign.</b> When it {{reached the top of}} the ramp and the <b>stop</b> <b>sign,</b> the bus was traveling at highway speed. The driver lost control of the bus, which slid sideways into a concrete bridge wall and chain-link security fence, then fell 19 feet, landing on its left side across the interstate highway below. Twenty-nine passengers survived the crash, while seven occupants were killed.|$|E
