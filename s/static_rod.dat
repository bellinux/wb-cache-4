40|$|AbstractSubtle {{regional}} differences in microglial phenotype {{exist in the}} adult mouse brain. We investigated whether these differences were amplified during ageing and following systemic challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We studied microglial morphology and phenotype in young (4 mo) and aged (21 mo) C 57 /BL 6 mice using immunohistochemistry and quantified the expression levels of surface molecules on microglia in white and grey matter along the rostral-caudal neuraxis. We detected significant regional, age dependent differences in microglial phenotypes, with the microglia of white matter and caudal areas of the CNS exhibiting greater upregulation of CD 11 b, CD 68, CD 11 c, F 4 / 80 and FcγRI than grey matter and rostral CNS areas. Upregulation of CD 11 c with age was restricted to the white matter, as was the appearance of multinucleated giant cells. Systemic LPS caused a subtle upregulation of FcγRI after 24 h, but the other markers examined were not affected. Burrowing behaviour and <b>static</b> <b>rod</b> assays {{were used to assess}} hippocampal and cerebellar integrity. Aged mice exhibited exaggerated and prolonged burrowing deficits following systemic LPS injection, while {{in the absence of an}} inflammatory challenge aged mice performed significantly worse than young mice in the <b>static</b> <b>rod</b> test.

40|$|Mice are {{increasingly}} being used in behavioral neuroscience, largely replacing rats as the behaviorist's animal of choice. Before aspects of behavior such as emotionality or cognition can be assessed, however, {{it is vital to}} determine whether the motor capabilities of e. g. a mutant or lesioned mouse allow such an assessment. Performance on a maze task requiring strength and coordination, such as the Morris water maze, might well be impaired in a mouse by motor, rather than cognitive, impairments, so it is essential to selectively dissect the latter from the former. For example, sensorimotor impairments caused by NMDA antagonists have been shown to impair water maze performance 2. Motor coordination has traditionally been assessed in mice and rats by the rotarod test, in which the animal is placed on a horizontal rod that rotates about its long axis; the animal must walk forwards to remain upright and not fall off. Both set speed and accelerating versions of the rotarod are available. The other three tests described in this article (horizontal bar, <b>static</b> <b>rods</b> and parallel bars) all measure coordination on static apparatus. The horizontal bar also requires strength for adequate performance, particularly of the forelimbs as the mouse initially grips the bar just with the front paws. Adult rats do not perform well on tests such as the <b>static</b> <b>rods</b> and parallel bars (personal observations); they appear less well coordinated than mice. I have only tested male rats, however, and male mice seem generally less well coordinated than females. Mice appear to have a highe...|$|R

40|$|Inspired by Kirchhoff’s kinetic analogy, {{the special}} Cosserat theory of rods is formulatedin the {{language}} of Lagrangian mechanics. A <b>static</b> <b>rod</b> corresponds to an abstract Lagrangian system where the energy density takes {{the role of the}} Lagrangian function. The equilibrium equations are derived from a variational principle. Noether’s theorem relates their first integrals to frame-indifference, isotropy and uniformity. These properties can be formulated in terms of Lie group symmetries. The rotational degrees of freedom, present in the geometrically exact beam theory, are represented in terms of orthonormal director triads. To reduce the number of unknowns, Lagrange multipliers associated with the orthonormality constraints are eliminated using null-space matrices. This is done both in the continuous and in the discrete setting. The discrete equilibrium equations are used to compute discrete rod configurations, where different types of boundary conditions can be handled...|$|E

Here, we report the generation of the first humanized ataxin- 3 knock-in mouse model (Ki 91), which provides insights into the neuronal and glial pathology of SCA 3 /MJD. First, mutant ataxin- 3 accumulated in cell nuclei across the Ki 91 brain, showing diffused immunostaining and forming intranuclear inclusions. The humanized allele revealed expansion and contraction of CAG repeats in intergenerational transmissions. CAG mutation also exhibited age-dependent tissue-specific expansion, which was most prominent in the cerebellum, pons and testes of Ki 91 animals. Moreover, Ki 91 mice displayed neuroinflammatory processes, showing astrogliosis in the cerebellar white matter and the substantia nigra that paralleled the transcriptional deregulation of Serpina 3 n, a molecular sign of neurodegeneration and brain damage. Simultaneously, the cerebellar Purkinje cells in Ki 91 mice showed neurodegeneration, a pronounced decrease in Calbindin D- 28 k immunoreactivity and a mild decrease in cell number, thereby modeling the degeneration of the cerebellum observed in SCA 3. Moreover, these molecular and cellular neuropathologies were accompanied by late behavioral deficits in motor coordination observed in rotarod and <b>static</b> <b>rod</b> tests in heterozygous Ki 91 animals. In summary, we created an ataxin- 3 knock-in mouse model that combines the molecular and behavioral disease phenotypes with the genetic features of SCA 3. This model will be very useful for studying the pathogenesis and responses to therapy of SCA 3 /MJD and other polyQ disorders...|$|E

40|$|Behavioural testing {{can reveal}} effects in scrapie-infected mice long before overt {{clinical}} signs appear (Betmouni et al., 1999, Psychobiology, 27, 63 - 71). These effects may be partly attributable to an early, atypical inflammatory {{response in the}} brain (Betmouni et al., 1996, Neuroscience, 74, 1 - 5). The present study replicated and extended these findings, and examined the effect of chronic treatment with dapsone. This anti-inflammatory compound {{has been reported to}} delay disease onset in a rat model of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (Manuelidis et al., 1998, Lancet, 352, 456). Although the doses {{used in the present study}} were higher than those of Manuelidis et al. (1998), no attenuation of the disease was seen in either behavioural or subsequent histological tests. Burrowing, i. e. displacing food pellets from a tube in the home cage, decreased from around week 12 in scrapie-infected mice, as did consumption of palatable glucose solution. Concurrently, ambulation in an open field increased, as did rearing at around week 17. Spontaneous alternation was impaired around this time. Around 18 weeks, motor performance on an inverted screen, horizontal bar, rotating <b>rod</b> and <b>static</b> <b>rods</b> decreased. Nest construction was impaired at 20 weeks. Overt clinical signs (reduction in mobility, hunched posture, poor coat condition, bladder enlargement) only occurred after week 20, when the mice were prepared for histology. The ME 7 scrapie-infected mice thus showed a characteristic complex of neurological and behavioural changes during the course of the disease that were not ameliorated by dapsone.

40|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS) is {{a genetic}} disorder {{arising from the}} presence of a third copy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa 21). Recently, O'Doherty et al. [An aneuploid mouse strain carrying human chromosome 21 with Down syndrome phenotypes. Science 309 (2005) 2033 – 2037] generated a trans-species aneuploid mouse line (Tc 1) that carries an almost complete Hsa 21. The Tc 1 mouse is the most complete animal model for DS currently available. Tc 1 mice show many features that relate to human DS, including alterations in memory, synaptic plasticity, cerebellar neuronal number, heart development and mandible size. Because motor deficits {{are one of the most}} frequently occurring features of DS, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of motor behaviour in cerebellum-dependent learning tasks that require high motor coordination and balance. In addition, basic electrophysiological properties of cerebellar circuitry and synaptic plasticity have been investigated. Our results reveal that, compared with controls, Tc 1 mice exhibit a higher spontaneous locomotor activity, a reduced ability to habituate to their environments, a different gait and major deficits on several measures of motor coordination and balance in the rota rod and <b>static</b> <b>rod</b> tests. Moreover, cerebellar long-term depression is essentially normal in Tc 1 mice, with only a slight difference in time course. Our observations provide further evidence that support the validity of the Tc 1 mouse as a model for DS, which will help us to provide insights into the causal factors responsible for motor deficits observed in persons with DS...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{attempts}} {{to clarify the}} between-subjects variability exhibited in both segmental stabilisation strategies and their subordinated or associated sensory contribution. Previous data have emphasised close relationships between the interindividual variability in both the visual control of posture and the spatial visual perception. In this study, we focused on the possible relationships that might link perceptual visual field dependence-independence and the visual contribution to segmental stabilisation strategies. Visual field dependent (FD) and field independent (FI) subjects were {{selected on the basis}} of their extreme score in a <b>static</b> <b>rod</b> and frame test where an estimation of the subjective vertical was required. In the postural test, the subjects stood in the sharpened Romberg position in darkness or under normal or stroboscopic illumination, in front of either a vertical or a tilted frame. Strategies of segmental stabilisation of the head, shoulders and hip in the roll plane were analysed by means of their anchoring index (AI). Our hypothesis was that FD subjects might use mainly visual cues for calibrating not only their spatial perception but also their strategies of segmental stabilisation. In the case of visual cue disturbances, a greater visual dependency to the strategies of segmental stabilisation in FD subjects should be validated by observing more systematic "en bloc" functioning (i. e. negative AI) between two adjacent segments. The main results are the following: 1. Strategies of segmental stabilisation differed between both groups and differences were amplified with the deprivation of either total vision and/or static visual cues. 2. In the absence of total vision and/or static visual cues, FD subjects have shown an increased efficiency of the hip stabilisation in space strategy and an "en bloc" operation of the shoulder-hip unit (whole trunk). The last "en bloc" operation was extended to the whole head-trunk unit in darkness, associated with a hip stabilisation in space. 3. The FI subjects have adopted neither a strategy of segmental stabilisation in space nor on the underlying segment, whatever the body segment considered and the visual condition. Thus, in this group, head, shoulder and hip moved independently from each other during stance control, roughly without taking into account the visual condition. The results, emphasising a differential weighting of sensory input involved in both perceptual and postural control, are discussed in terms of the differential choice and/or ability to select the adequate frame of reference common to both cognitive and motor spatial activities. We assumed that a motor-somesthetics "neglect" or a lack of mastering of these inputs/outputs rather than a mere visual dependence in FD subjects would generate these interindividual differences in both spatial perception and postural balance. This proprioceptive "neglect" is assumed to lead FD subjects to sensory reweighting, whereas proprioceptive dominance would lead FI subjects to a greater ability in selecting the adequate frame of reference in the case of intersensory disturbances. Finally, this study also provides evidence for a new interpretation of the visual field dependence-independence dimension in both spatial perception and postural control...|$|E

40|$|Two {{problems}} {{in the study of}} elastic filaments are considered. First, a reliable numerical algorithm is developed that candetermine the shape of a <b>static</b> elastic <b>rod</b> under a variety ofconditions. In this algorithm the governing equations are writtenentirely in terms of local coordinates and are discretized usingfinite differences. The algorithm has two significant advantages:firstly, it can be implemented {{for a wide variety of}} the boundaryconditions and, secondly, it enables the user to work with generalconstitutive relationships with only minor changes to thealgorithm. In the second problem a model is presented describingthe dynamics of an elastic tube conveying a fluid. First weanalyze instabilities that are present in a straight rod or tubeunder tension subject to increasing twist in the absence of afluid. As the twist is increased beyond a critical value, thefilament undergoes a twist-to-writhe bifurcation. A multiplescales expansion is used to derive nonlinear amplitude equationsto examine the dynamics of the elastic rod beyond the bifurcationthreshold. This problem is then reinvestigated for an elastic tubeconveying a fluid to study the effect of fluid flow on thetwist-to-writhe instability. A linear stability analysisdemonstrates that for an infinite rod the twist-to-writhethreshold is lowered by the presence of a fluid flow. Amplitudeequations are then derived from which the delay of bifurcation dueto finite tube length is determined. It is shown that the delayedbifurcation threshold depends delicately on the length of the tubeand that it can be either raised or lowered relative to thefluid-free case. The amplitude equations derived for the case of aconstant average fluid flux are compared to the case where theflux depends on the curvature. In this latter case it is shownthat inclusion of curvature results in small changes in some ofthe coefficients in the amplitude equations and has only a smalleffect on the post-bifurcation dynamics...|$|R

Transgenic mice (R 6 / 1 line), expressing a CAG repeat encoding an expanded polyglutamine tract in the N-terminus of the huntingtin protein, closely model HD. We have previously shown that environmental enrichment of these HD mice delays the onset of motor deficits. Furthermore, wheel running initiated in adulthood ameliorates the rear-paw clasping motor sign, but not an accelerating rotarod deficit. Results We have now {{examined the effects of}} enhanced physical activity via wheel running, commenced at a juvenile age (4 weeks), with respect to the onset of various behavioral deficits and their neuropathological correlates in R 6 / 1 HD mice. HD mice housed post-weaning with running wheels only, to enhance voluntary physical exercise, have delayed onset of a motor co-ordination deficit on the <b>static</b> horizontal <b>rod,</b> as well as rear-paw clasping, although the accelerating rotarod deficit remains unaffected. Both wheel running and environmental enrichment rescued HD-induced abnormal habituation of locomotor activity and exploratory behavior in the open field. We have found that neither environment enrichment nor wheel running ameliorates the shrinkage of the striatum and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in HD mice, nor the overall decrease in brain weight, measured at 9 months of age. At this age, the density of ubiquitinated protein aggregates in the striatum and ACC is also not significantly ameliorated by environmental enrichment or wheel running. Conclusion These results indicate that enhanced voluntary physical activity, commenced at an early presymptomatic stage, contributes to the positive effects of environmental enrichment. However, sensory and cognitive stimulation, as well as motor stimulation not associated with running, may constitute major components of the therapeutic benefits associated with enrichment. Comparison of different environmental manipulations, performed in specific time windows, can identify critical periods for the induction of neuroprotective 'brain reserve' in animal models of HD and related neurodegenerative diseases. </p...|$|R

When it was first discovered that genes can be controlled by DNA elements located many kilobases away from the transcribed gene itself, such "enhancers " {{were thought to be}} entry sites for regulatory proteins.

Now we know that the two polymerases are locked together in a rigid replication machine and that the DNA template for the lagging strand loops out from the twin polymerases. Because of the enormous length of DNA, textbooks have also generally depicted the chromosome as stationary and the replication machinery as a kind of locomotive chugging along the DNA track.

We showed that by considering the mechanical effects of highly elastic axial deformation, the model accuracy is increased up to 6 %. The proposed model predicts experimental results with 6 %- 8 % (4 - 6 mm) mean error for the Ritz-Galerkin method in static cases and 16 %- 20 % (12 - 14 mm) mean error for the Ritz method in dynamic cases, in planar and general three-dimensional motions.
