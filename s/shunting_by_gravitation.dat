5000|$|The term g-force is {{technically}} incorrect {{as it is}} a measure of acceleration, not force. While acceleration is a vector quantity, g-force accelerations ("g-forces" [...] for short) are often expressed as a scalar, with positive g-forces pointing downward (indicating upward acceleration), and negative g-forces pointing upward. Thus, a g-force is a vector acceleration. It is an acceleration that must be produced by a mechanical force, and cannot be produced <b>by</b> simple <b>gravitation.</b> Objects acted upon only <b>by</b> <b>gravitation,</b> experience (or [...] "feel") no g-force, and are weightless.|$|R
40|$|Within the RSJ model we {{performed}} an analytical and numerical investigation of SQUID cells {{consisting of two}} Josephson junctions <b>shunted</b> <b>by</b> an extremely small inductance leading to strong coupling of the elements. Contrary to the well-known behavior of cells <b>shunted</b> <b>by</b> a high inductance voltage phases of the junctions are locked with very small phase difference for almost all values of external flux. Only for external flux {{in the vicinity of}} half a flux quantum phase difference rises rapidly to π. Comment: 11 pages, LaTeX, report JENA-FKS- 94 -...|$|R

It {{turns out that}} the stability condition is affected <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> through the equilibrium values only. Comment: 5 page...|$|R
50|$|The {{momentum}} compaction or momentum compaction {{factor is}} a measure for the momentum dependence of the recirculation path length for an object that is bound in cyclic motion (closed orbit). It {{is used in the}} calculation of particle paths in circular particle accelerators (like synchrotrons), and for astronomical objects that are bound <b>by</b> <b>gravitation.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kain Grinder: Kain is the {{balanced}} {{character of the}} roster, his tribe was <b>shunted</b> <b>by</b> the forces of Damud. He boasts excellent reach and priority with his sword. Kain possesses no apparent weaknesses. He uses ice/water magic.|$|R
50|$|In 1883 {{the first}} of several red brick water towers were built to supply the growing town with water. Water was pumped out of the river and into the top of the tower by a {{wood-fired}} steam engine, and then flowed <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> to surrounding businesses and private residences. Many of these towers can still be seen around town.|$|R
50|$|A {{star system}} or stellar {{system is a}} small number of stars that orbit each other, bound by {{gravitational}} attraction. A large number of stars bound <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> is generally called a star cluster or galaxy, although, broadly speaking, they are also star systems. Star systems are {{not to be confused with}} planetary systems, which include planets and similar bodies.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive's {{cylinders}} were mounted {{outside the}} frame and were lubricated <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> from two tallow cups, attached to the smokebox sides immediately above the steam chests. The feedwater pumps, attached {{to the back of}} the spectacle plate, were operated from the piston crossheads. The locomotive used wooden brake blocks which were driver-operated by a hand brake in the cab.|$|R
40|$|A superconducting microbridge {{small enough}} to exhibit the Josephson effect has been <b>shunted</b> <b>by</b> a large {{external}} capacitance. Surprisingly little capacitive hysteresis is observed in its I-V characteristic. Prominent subgap structures are seen. The resistively shunted junction (RSJ) model fails to explain the observations...|$|R
50|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway 0-4-0T {{locomotives}} {{were two}} small 0-4-0T locomotives built for <b>shunting</b> <b>by</b> the Bristol and Exeter Railway. On 1 January 1876 the Bristol and Exeter Railway was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway, {{after which the}} locomotives were given new numbers.|$|R
50|$|Once {{delivered}} to the station, coal was <b>shunted</b> <b>by</b> locomotives. Croydon B had a fleet of three shunting locomotives, all built by Peckett and Sons with the works numbers No.2103, No.2104 and No.2105. These three steam locomotives were superseded by diesels in the 1960s.|$|R
6000|$|Is it {{not also}} strange {{that in a}} {{treatise}} entering into so high mathematical analysis as that from which I quote, the false word 'swing,' expressing the action of a body liable to continuous arrest <b>by</b> <b>gravitation,</b> should be employed to signify the oscillation, wholly unaffected by gravity, of substance in which the motion once originated, may cease only with {{the essence of the}} body? ...|$|R
40|$|Rabbits {{were exposed}} to single maximum endurable {{stresses}} of cranio-caudal direction, hypokinesia for periods of one to eight weeks, and hypokinesia followed <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> stresses. The stresses caused dilatation of vessels, greater sinuosity, and occasional ruptures of the walls and extravasation. The greater part of the capillaries were dilated; the greatest part constricted. In hypokinesia there was an increasing atrophy of the testes. Significant results are reported...|$|R
30|$|Theoretical {{limitations}} of the study are a) documentation of pulmonary <b>shunt</b> <b>by</b> means of pulmonary catheterization was not implemented in the study design, b) fundamental differences of tetrapod vertebrates compared to humans regarding prone or supine position in lung injury models have not been described in literature.|$|R
5000|$|Approximately 20 {{platform}} {{cars were}} [...] "brought onto the road," [...] which operated <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> {{in one direction}} and by horse-power in the other. The ascent between the canal and the quarries was about 400 ft. The loaded trains moved downwards, [...] "checked in their movements only by the brakes," [...] and were drawn back by horses which were carried along on the train for use on the return trip.|$|R
50|$|Station pilots have {{recently}} been phased out in the UK as the majority of passenger trains are formed with multiple units or have a Driving Van Trailer {{at the opposite end}} to the locomotive; the few locomotive-hauled passenger trains are <b>shunted</b> <b>by</b> the train engine rather than a dedicated station pilot.|$|R
5000|$|Forces can {{be either}} placed {{directly}} by the user or produced <b>by</b> adding <b>gravitation,</b> Coulomb force or other effects.|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{somewhat}} well described {{example of a}} topopolis in the novel Matter by Iain M. Banks. This particular topopolis looped its system star many times in various braidings, housing trillions of sapient residents. The topopolis was so massive that stray gases from the system collected within the major spacing within the braids <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> alone, producing a slight atmosphere between the strands, described by the author as a [...] "haze".|$|R
25|$|The {{magnitude}} and sign of both those parameters {{are controlled by}} the base current : since both base-collector and base-emitter junctions are inversely biased in the quiescent state, the equivalent circuit of the base input is simply a current generator <b>shunted</b> <b>by</b> base-emitter and base-collector junction capacitances and is therefore not analyzed in what follows.|$|R
40|$|A Lagrangian {{formalism}} is used {{to derive}} the Hamiltonian for a λ/ 4 resonator <b>shunted</b> <b>by</b> a current-biased Josephson junction. The eigenstates and the quantum dynamics of the system are analyzed numerically, and we show that the system can function as an efficient detector of weak incident microwave fields.

40|$|We treated seromas {{developing}} in two patients {{in relation to}} left-sided modified Blalock-Taussig <b>shunts</b> <b>by</b> reattaching the original graft to the descending aorta. We postulate that seromas may develop {{because of the large}} area of contact between the graft and blood. Shortening the length of the Gore-Tex graft may therefore be a feasible treatment. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
25|$|In general relativity, this {{remaining}} precession, {{or change}} of {{orientation of the}} orbital ellipse within its orbital plane, is explained <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> being mediated <b>by</b> the curvature of spacetime. Einstein showed that general relativity agrees closely with the observed amount of perihelion shift. This was a powerful factor motivating the adoption of general relativity. Recently, Friedman and Steiner obtained the observed perihelion shift and explained its origin without curving spacetime using the relativistic Newtonian dynamics model.|$|R
60|$|Oak was an {{intensely}} humane man: indeed, his humanity often tore in pieces any politic intentions of his which bordered on strategy, {{and carried him}} on as <b>by</b> <b>gravitation.</b> A shadow in his life had always been that his flock ended in mutton--that a day came and found every shepherd an arrant traitor to his defenseless sheep. His first feeling now was one of pity for the untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their unborn lambs.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a series of tests of {{agreement}} between three types of N-body simulations: PM, P 3 M, and Tree codes. We find good agreement in both the individual and the statistical properties only on scales larger than the mean interparticle separation. As a result, we question most numerical results at and below below galaxy scales, either concerning primordial dark matter or baryonic matter coupled to it <b>by</b> <b>gravitation.</b> Subject headings: cosmology:miscellaneous–gravitation–hydrodynamics– methods: numerical–dark matter 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a scalar-tensor theory of gravitation with the scalar source being the {{trace of the}} stress-energy tensor of the scalar field itself and matter. We obtain {{an example of a}} numerical solution of the cosmological equations which shows that under some special choice of the scalar parameters, there exists a slow-roll regime in which the modern values of the Hubble and deceleration parameters may be obtained.

5000|$|On 17 August 1843 {{the tube}} was {{exhausted}} {{for the first}} time, and the following day a trial run was made. On Saturday 19 August the line was opened to the public. [...] In service a typical speed of 30 mph was attained; return to Kingstown was <b>by</b> <b>gravitation</b> down the gradient, and slower. By March 1844, 35 train movements operated daily, and 4,500 passengers a week travelled on the line, mostly simply for the novelty.|$|R
