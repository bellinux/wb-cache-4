40|$|Compliance with {{occupational}} {{health and safety}} (OHS) regulation requires a significant commitment in terms of time, money and personnel which is potentially difficult for many organisations who are struggling to survive in the current economic climate. The study initially evaluated the levels of OHS awareness and knowledge and established the OHS administrative burdens in small, medium and large organisations in Ireland. This was done by means of a questionnaire distributed to organisations nationally. The questionnaire identified that the completion of risk assessments, safety statements and OHS training were the most significant OHS administrative burdens in participating organisations. Online or electronic applications were identified by 88 % of participants (n= 180) as the preferred method of completion of OHS administrative activities. <b>Small</b> <b>organisations</b> (1 - 49 employees) have been identified as having greater difficulties with OHS legislative compliance than medium (50 - 249 employees) and large organisations (250 + employees). The responses obtained in the initial questionnaire (n= 205) were used to develop an online tool, namely SME Safety, to assist in addressing the administrative burden posed by OHS regulation, specifically in <b>small</b> <b>organisations.</b> A four month trial of the online tool, SME Safety, took place in 77 <b>small</b> <b>organisations</b> across Ireland. Questionnaires were distributed to the organisations before and after the trial. The final responses indicated that the participants’ awareness of their OHS legal responsibilities, the risk assessment process and safety statements contents had increased significantly. Participants indicated that they would be more willing to allocate time and money to OHS following the trial of SME Safety and that they felt significantly more positive towards OHS. The findings highlight the potential value of an online OHS information tool, specifically tailored to <b>small</b> <b>organisations,</b> as a <b>means</b> of addressing the administrative burden of OHS regulation...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of feed-in tariffs and renewable heat incentives in the UK {{has provided a}} new financial incentive for the installation of micro-generation, but so far there has been limited research on its uptake in <b>small</b> <b>organisations.</b> Our research starts to fill that gap by presenting a unique case study of the Camden Climate Change Alliance (CCCA) of <b>small</b> <b>organisations</b> to explore the perceived barriers and incentives to installation among members. We assess how micro-generation is viewed {{in the context of}} wider environmental measures to discover that ‘green marketing’ provides a strong incentive while upfront costs remain the primary barrier. Participants in the study prioritise energy efficiency over micro-generation due to shorter paybacks, which leads us to propose an Energy Hierarchy Framework model as a useful tool towards the adoption of micro-generation in SMEs and other <b>small</b> <b>organisations.</b> The CCCA is successful at enabling <b>small</b> <b>organisations</b> to participate in environmental management by offering free workshops, audits and events. As a large proportion of UK carbon emissions derive from <b>small</b> <b>organisations,</b> reductions could be achieved through the setting up of similar climate change alliances by local authorities {{in other areas of the}} country...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of organisations {{in the construction}} industry are <b>small</b> <b>organisations,</b> how ever their safety performance is still far behind their larger counterparts. Therefore, it is important to focus on improving safety performance of <b>small</b> <b>organisations</b> so that the overall industry performance may be improved. Using a questionnaire survey, this research collected data from construction organisations based in New South Wales, Australia. Data analysis results have identified key barriers faced by <b>small</b> <b>organisations</b> when implementing safety. These barriers include the use of lowest bid price to evaluate tender submissions, lack of safety commitment from construction clients, and fierce competition. The analysis results have also revealed potential strategies for overcoming the barriers, such as including safety as an indicator in tender evaluation, more effective safety regulation enforcement by inspection and linking safety performance with insurance premium and licencing system, and subsidising safety training for <b>small</b> <b>organisations.</b> Improving safety performance in this sector cannot be done in isolation.

40|$|Efforts to {{improving}} {{safety in the}} construction industry have mainly been adopted by large organisations. As a result, these organisations have managed to substantially improve their safety performance. The construction industry, however, is dominated by <b>small</b> <b>organisations.</b> These organisations are facing difficulties to implement safety and, as a result, their safety performance is worse than their larger counterparts. Due to their large proportion {{in the construction industry}}, a small improvement among <b>small</b> <b>organisations</b> should have considerable impacts on the overall safety performance of the industry. This research aims to identify potential strategies to improve safety in <b>small</b> <b>organisations</b> {{in the context of the}} Australian construction industry. A questionnaire was developed based on a list of barriers and strategies identified from the existing literature. The questionnaire was then distributed to construction practitioners in Australia, particularly those working in <b>small</b> construction <b>organisations,</b> to obtain the perceived importance of each barrier and strategy. Open-ended questions were also included allowing the respondents to add additional barriers and strategies. Many perceived that external environmental factors are the key barriers that hinder safety implementation in <b>small</b> <b>organisations.</b> Improving safety, therefore, requires the support from influential stakeholders in the industry. Clients should consider safety as one of the key project objectives and include safety as one of the criteria in tendering. The government and regulatory bodies need to enforce safety regulations effectively and subsidise safety training for qualified <b>small</b> <b>organisations.</b> Safety performance should also be linked to insurance premium and licencing system in the construction industry. Finally, existing mandatory safety training needs to be evaluated and revised, while safety compliance for <b>small</b> <b>organisations</b> should be simplified and made practical...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{construction}} industry {{has always been}} considered {{as one of the}} most dangerous industrial sectors. Large organisations have demonstrated good safety performance because they have the resources and leverage to develop and implement robust safety management systems. However, safety among <b>small</b> <b>organisations</b> is still far behind their larger counterparts and this issue is crucial because the majority of organisations in the {{construction industry}} are <b>small</b> <b>organisations.</b> Therefore, it is important to focus improvement efforts on safety performance of <b>small</b> <b>organisations</b> so that the overall industry performance may be improved. Using a questionnaire survey, this research collected data from construction organisations based in New South Wales, Australia. Data analysis results have identified key barriers faced by <b>small</b> <b>organisations</b> when implementing safety. These barriers include the use of lowest bid price to evaluate tender submissions, lack of safety commitment from construction clients, and fierce competition.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is threefold: first, to examine the job embeddedness (JE) -turnover {{intentions}} relationship in large and small organisations; second, to investigate how employee perceptions of each dimension of JE may differ in large and small organisations; and third, to determine if work group cohesion moderates the JE-turnover intentions relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Using a short form of the original JE questionnaire, data were collected from 549 employees in organisations located in four major business centres in South Africa. Participants were from organisations in diverse industries. Findings: JE predicted turnover intentions in large organisations, but not in <b>small</b> <b>organisations.</b> Contrary to expectations, employees in <b>small</b> <b>organisations</b> perceived that they would sacrifice more benefits than employees in large organisations if they were to quit. Results suggest that work group cohesion moderates the JE-turnover intentions relationship. Research limitations/implications: Further research is needed to determine how JE operates in different size organisations and in urban and rural <b>small</b> <b>organisations.</b> Practical implications: In <b>small</b> <b>organisations,</b> building group cohesion and persuasively communicating benefits of working in a <b>small</b> <b>organisation</b> can help to embed employees. Originality/value: This study responds to calls for further JE research in a wider range of national contexts. It contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the three dimensions of JE by investigating how employee perceptions of each dimension differ in large and <b>small</b> <b>organisations.</b> The study also responds to appeals for research that examines moderators of the JE-turnover relationship by exploring work group cohesion as a potential moderator...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} Closed Access. Small firms {{contribute}} significantly to the UK economy, but most research into learning and work features the experience of large organisations. This paper focuses on learning and work in <b>small</b> <b>organisations.</b> An interpretive framework relating to organisational learning {{is derived from the}} literature. Data on learning in <b>small</b> <b>organisations</b> that internationalise are analysed to assess the extent to which models of organisational learning are applicable to the context and challenges they face. This paper suggests that the large firm model of learning is inappropriate. The distinctive culture and communication systems of small firms require different approaches to the acquisition, transmission and interpretation of knowledge. Tacit knowledge, developed through informal learning, is a priority and learning through local business networks is more important than participation in formal programmes. Advocacy of HRD practices based on conventional theories of organisational learning, therefore, may hinder rather than encourage performance in <b>small</b> <b>organisations...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} software process improvement, intended for <b>small,</b> growing <b>organisations.</b> The publically available models, e. g. CMM, are not adequate for <b>small</b> <b>organisations.</b> One {{reason is that the}} number of roles proposed exceeds the number of employees. Another reason is that the responsibilities and tasks proposed are too many and rigorous, at least, in very <b>small</b> <b>organisations</b> with only a few employees. Neither is that kind of rigour needed if it is easy to get oversight of the activities because of the easy communication and organisational structure. The model described in this paper is a modified CMM, called "Dynamic CMM", applicable from the very start of an organisation and at the same time, supporting the quality and improvement activities while the organisation grows. The work behind the model is part of the research project QMSE (Quality Management for Small Enterprises), conducted at Ume University and financially supported by NUTEK.
