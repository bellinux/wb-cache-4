5|$|Blake {{decided to}} compose his score {{to match the}} key of the Schubert Mass, {{in order for the}} music to {{continue}} seamlessly. However, during the recording <b>session</b> <b>with</b> his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, he found that the Schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat, and he had to ask the players to tune flat to match his intended key.|$|E

5|$|After being {{signed by}} Mercury Records, the New York Dolls {{released}} their self-titled debut album in 1973 to poor sales. Although it was praised by critics, {{the band was}} not satisfied with producer Todd Rundgren's sound for the album and had disagreements with him before choosing not to retain him. Songwriting and production partners Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were originally enlisted to produce their next album, while the band's guitarist Johnny Thunders wanted to produce it himself. However, Leiber and Stoller withdrew shortly before recording was to begin. The group held a single <b>session</b> <b>with</b> Mercury A executive Paul Nelson at Media Sound Recording Studios, where they recorded 14 songs, {{most of which were}} covers.|$|E
5|$|As a mark {{of respect}} QPR {{postponed}} their upcoming game with Burnley, a team who in turn replaced it with an open training <b>session</b> <b>with</b> proceeds going to the charity of QPR's choice. QPR also decided to retire the number 31 shirt in memory of Jones, who wore that shirt during his career. In their league game against Southampton on 1 September 2007, all of the QPR players carried Jones' name {{on the back of}} their shirts as {{a mark of}} respect. Ten days later, in the England U19 friendly against Belarus at Meadow Lane in Nottingham, a minute's applause was held before the match.|$|E

5|$|Discussed in ArticleVIII, the {{judiciary}} {{was separated from}} the two other branches of the government, and was to be served by elective judges. Courts of first instance existed in each voivodeship and were in constant <b>session,</b> <b>with</b> judges elected by the regional sejmik assemblies. Appellate tribunals were established for the provinces, based on the reformed Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal. The Sejm elected from its deputies the judges for the Sejm court, a precursor to the modern State Tribunal of Poland. Referendary courts were established in each province to hear the cases of the peasantry. Municipal courts, described in the law on towns, complemented this system.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} timed runs in Q2, Lewis Hamilton was seven-tenths {{of a second}} quicker than {{teammate}} Rosberg, while the Ferrari cars split the pair to place provisional second and third. Nevertheless, both Mercedes drivers did not go out again. Sebastian Vettel set a second timed lap to improve his time, now {{a little more than}} a tenth behind Hamilton. Many drivers only set one timed lap towards the end of the <b>session,</b> <b>with</b> Pastor Maldonado, Felipe Nasr, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Daniil Kvyat unable to move on into Q3, while Ricciardo did not set a time, leaving him fifteenth for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{discussed}} the song at length in a 1987 interview for Musician magazine, {{during which he}} recalls that his mother developed a brain tumour late in 1969 but then recovered for seven months. After hearing of the initial diagnosis in September 1969, Harrison cancelled a recording <b>session</b> <b>with</b> Apple Records artist Jackie Lomax to see her; author Peter Doggett comments that, because {{of the severity of}} this news, Harrison would later have no recollection of how he heard of John Lennon's decision to leave the Beatles, on 20 September.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} {{practice}} session on Saturday morning, Hamilton managed to beat Ferrari, with the Englishman ahead of second-placed Massa by 0.063 seconds. Hamilton {{and the two}} Ferraris completed the top three, but Alonso was again down in eighth, having missed nearly {{the whole of the}} <b>session</b> <b>with</b> a faulty brake sensor. The Renaults sparked a return to form with Heikki Kovalainen and Giancarlo Fisichella fourth and fifth, both ahead of rivals BMW, who were sixth and fifteenth respectively.|$|E
5|$|Initial weather {{forecasts}} predicted rain for the Thursday qualifying sessions, but {{it failed}} to materialise. The teams had two full sessions of clear but hot and humid conditions. Nick Tandy's Porsche led the <b>session</b> <b>with</b> a three minutes and 18.862 seconds lap, but remained in third position on the provisional grid. Audi No. 7 {{was the only other}} car to put in an improved lap time amongst the top ten cars. TDS Racing was the fastest LMP2 car in the <b>session</b> <b>with</b> a three minutes and 40.441 seconds yet still over two seconds behind the pole time of KCMG. The LMGTE categories also remained much the same, as Aston Martin still occupied the top four qualifying positions. Twice the session was stopped for heavy accidents, first for the No. 55 AF Corse Ferrari of Duncan Cameron who became stuck in a gravel trap for about fifteen minutes. The second stoppage occurred when Jan Magnussen suffered a mechanical failure in his No. 63 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R and hit the barriers twice in the Porsche Curves. Repairs to the barriers forced the cancellation of the remainder of the session, although half an hour was added to the final qualifying session. Magnussen was transported to the track's medical centre for a check-up and later released by the race organiser's medical staff. The Corvette was unable to be repaired and the team was forced to withdraw from the race because they did not bring a spare chassis to Le Mans.|$|E
