5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had <b>simply</b> <b>said</b> she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E
25|$|Hopkins {{would later}} explain his comments, {{saying that it}} was not meant to be taken as a racial slur or a {{reflection}} of his feelings on white fighters, but <b>simply</b> <b>said</b> to create some hype for his fight with Calzaghe.|$|E
500|$|He {{listed the}} address of his {{personal}} web page announcing the discovery as /~mbrown/planetlila and in the chaos following {{the controversy over the}} discovery of Haumea, forgot to change it. Rather than needlessly anger more of his fellow astronomers, he <b>simply</b> <b>said</b> that the webpage had been named for his daughter and dropped [...] "Lila" [...] from consideration.|$|E

500|$|Simmons and Layfield reunited for {{one night}} only for Raw 1000 on July 23, 2012, when they {{provided}} protection for Lita during her brief match with Heath Slater. Layfield attacked Slater with a Clothesline from Hell, and after the match, Simmons <b>simply</b> <b>said</b> his trademark catchphrase, [...] "Damn" [...] (in commentary Jerry [...] "The King" [...] Lawler giddily speculated that it [...] "may {{have been the best}} one that JBL has ever delivered").|$|E
500|$|Wise's {{main source}} of {{diversion}} during this period was funerals; she seldom missed a visit to any funeral held {{in or near the}} town, whether she had known the deceased or not. When questioned, she <b>simply</b> <b>said</b> that she liked funerals. Albert Wise died suddenly in 1923, leaving his wife a 40-year-old widow with four children. Her odd behavior and fixation on funerals became more noticeable, [...] and she began not only attending funerals, but openly crying and lamenting at them, no matter who had died.|$|E
500|$|Chance {{died at age}} 48. Some sources <b>simply</b> <b>said</b> that he {{died after}} a [...] "long illness", while others {{attributed}} it to heart disease brought on by severe spasms of bronchial asthma. He was survived by his wife, mother, sister, and three brothers. Chance was interred in the Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, Los Angeles. His death was greatly mourned, and his funeral received widespread publicity in Los Angeles and Chicago. Among his pallbearers were Powers and race car driver Barney Oldfield. His estate was valued at $170,000 ($2.35 million today).|$|E

500|$|Chikafusa likely used Kamakura period Kokinshū commentaries such as {{the extant}} , which speculates that one of Komachi's poems was left for Narihira after a tryst. The Bishamondō-bon Kokinshū-chū in turn likely worked from a then-common belief that fictional Tales of Ise was a genuine {{historical}} work detailing the actual events in Narihira's life (see above). Kamakura period commentaries on The Tales of Ise therefore tried to insert the names of real women where the original text <b>simply</b> <b>said</b> [...] "a woman", and thus inserted Ono no Komachi into several passages of the text.|$|E
500|$|Slezak {{said that}} the vocals on [...] "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)" [...] were [...] "fantastic" [...] and graded the song an [...] Flandez called the Troubletones [...] "fine, fierce and fabulous", though Chaney wrote that the {{rendition}} was [...] "a fairly routine take". Chaney and Slezak both wondered about the extra girls in the number, but Lynch <b>simply</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Nice {{to get a little}} Troubletones action separate from (but still part of) the New Directions". Lynch's grade was a [...] "B", in part because Mercedes's voice [...] "seemed strangely buried".|$|E
500|$|Brazilian {{newspapers}} {{greeted the}} result with headlines such as [...] "The Biggest Shame in History" [...] (Lance!), a [...] "Historical humiliation" [...] (Folha de S.Paulo) and [...] "Brazil is slain" [...] (O Globo). German paper Bild heralded the [...] "7–1 Madness" [...] by the [...] "Lightning DFB team". The French L'Équipe <b>simply</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Le Désastre" [...] (The Disaster). Writing for Sky Sports, Matthew Stanger described {{the game as}} the [...] "ultimate embarrassment", while Miguel Delaney of ESPN referred to the match as the Mineirazo, echoing the term invented for the event by the South American Spanish language press.|$|E

500|$|The first {{mention in}} the Great St Bernard Hospice {{archives}} of a dog was in 1707 which <b>simply</b> <b>said</b> [...] "A dog was buried by us." [...] The dogs {{are thought to have}} been introduced to the monastery as watchdogs at some point between 1660 and 1670. Old skulls from the collection of the Natural History Museum of Bern show that at least two types of dog lived at the hospice. By 1800, the year that Barry was born, it was known that a special kind of dog was being used for rescue work in the pass. This general variety of dog was known as a Küherhund, or cowherd's dog.|$|E
500|$|Trenchard {{arrived in}} India in late 1893, joining his {{regiment}} at Sialkot in the Punjab. [...] Not long after his arrival, Trenchard was {{called upon to}} make a speech at a mess dinner night. [...] It was common practice for the youngest subaltern {{to make such a}} speech and Trenchard was expected to cover several highlights of the Royal Scots Fusiliers' history. [...] Instead, he <b>simply</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I am deeply proud to belong to this great regiment", followed by [...] "I hope one day I shall live to command it." [...] His 'speech' was received with hoots of incredulous laughter, although some appreciated his nerve.|$|E
500|$|In April 2007, {{nearly a}} year after Croyle was drafted, Chiefs {{starting}} quarterback Trent Green {{was traded to the}} Miami Dolphins. In the months prior to the trade agreement, Green had stated that he was being treated unfairly {{on and off the field}} and that the pre-season quarterback competition was [...] "weighted" [...] towards Croyle. Head coach Herman Edwards, who was emphasizing a [...] "youth movement" [...] on the team's roster at the time, voiced his displeasure with Green's outspoken comments and <b>simply</b> <b>said</b> that he was [...] "trying to create competition." [...] Edwards indicated throughout the off-season that the Chiefs' starting quarterback position was up for grabs.|$|E

500|$|Perry {{thoroughly}} enjoyed {{what he was}} doing, {{saying in}} a 1989 interview, [...] "I {{got a kick out}} of live television. The spontaneity was the fun of it." [...] Spontaneity and the ability to be himself came in handy for swimmer/actress Esther Williams' guest appearance of March 16, 1957. A wardrobe malfunction meant that viewers were seeing more of Esther than 1950s television considered to be in good taste; more live show mishaps followed. At the show's end, Williams was swimming in a pool specially constructed on the set for her appearance. Como <b>simply</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Goodnight, folks," [...] and leaped, fully clothed, into the swimming pool.|$|E
500|$|Ono began visiting and telephoning Lennon's home and, {{when his}} wife asked him for an explanation, Lennon {{explained}} that Ono {{was only trying to}} obtain money for her [...] "avant-garde bullshit". While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album, after which, he said, they [...] "made love at dawn." [...] When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who <b>simply</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Oh, hi." [...] Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968, a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of Queen Victoria in 1901, the new Queen, Alexandra, insisted on {{replacing}} Helena as President of the Army Nursing Service. This {{gave rise to a}} further breach between the royal ladies, with King Edward VII caught in the middle between his sister and his wife. Lady Roberts, a courtier, wrote to a friend: [...] "matters were sometimes very difficult and not always pleasant." [...] However, in accordance with rank, Helena agreed to resign in Alexandra's favour, and she retained presidency of the Army Nursing Reserve. Though thought to be merely an artefact created by society ladies, Helena exercised an efficient and autocratic regime—"if anyone ventures to disagree with Her Royal Highness she has <b>simply</b> <b>said,</b> 'It is my wish, that is sufficient.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Bessell further {{maintained}} that in January 1969 Thorpe {{called him to}} a meeting together with Holmes, and that again Thorpe put forward suggestions for eliminating Scott. These were dismissed as impractical or ridiculous by Bessell and Holmes, who nevertheless agreed to give the matter further consideration. They hoped, said Bessell, that if they stalled, Thorpe would see the absurdity of his murder scheme and abandon it. Holmes, who largely confirmed Bessell's account of the meeting, later justified this decision {{on the grounds that}} [...] "if we had <b>simply</b> <b>said</b> no, he might have gone elsewhere—and that might have led to an even greater disaster." [...] According to Bessell and Holmes, discussions of the plan ended in May 1969, after the surprising news of Scott's wedding that month.|$|E
500|$|When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for {{the only}} time in my life I was discourteous, which I regret to this day. I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it." [...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he <b>simply</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E
500|$|After dismissing a {{few more}} {{questions}} as [...] "unimportant", the 18-year-old giggled childishly and said he [...] "needed a lawyer". Lamb's conversation with the doctor continued incoherently, with Lamb [...] "leaping from topic to topic", in Yaworsky's words. The young man continued to rise and pace around the room as the interview went on; {{he spoke in a}} casual, off-hand manner, giving non-specific answers to the doctor's questions and describing people especially vaguely. When asked about his parents, he <b>simply</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I don't remember." [...] Yaworsky then inquired where his mother was, leading the boy to laugh as he replied, [...] "I don't remember. Somewhere." [...] When the doctor finally asked directly about the night of the shootings, Lamb said that he could not recall shooting anybody and that all he remembered was going home in a taxi, then being awoken by his uncle shaking him.|$|E
