40|$|The {{most crucial}} segment of our {{population}} {{from the point of}} view of the quality of our future generation is today’s girls who are just on the threshold of marriage and motherhood. These girls are our future home maker. Their attainments and competence will be the major determinants of the health and nutrition of children of the next generation. The health condition of these girls needs more attention. Todays Girl’s are getting educated and for their education they have to leave their <b>homes</b> and <b>stay</b> in hostels or rented rooms. This results in change in the surroundings and diet leading to stress and nutritional deficiencies. So it was thought interesting to compare the diet or nutritional status of girl students <b>staying</b> away from <b>home</b> <b>likes</b> in hostels or rented rooms with their hemoglobin. Change in the diet during vacations was also correlated with change in hemoglobin percentage. The objectives of the present study was to estimate the hemoglobin percentage of girls in different conditions that is before and after vacation, before and after exam, before then correlate with their diet and comparing with the diet of girls in different groups that is girls in hostel, residing at rooms and <b>staying</b> at <b>home.</b> The results will be correlated with diet and accordingly recommendation count be given to the hostel authorities for the improvement of food quality. The girls will also be made aware of importance of proper nutrition and its effects on ability to concentrate on studies...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. How do {{increasing}} {{levels of}} education affect parents’ decisions to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> with their children? When children are born parents {{make the decision to}} <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> and raise them or to continue at their jobs in the labor force. Parents need to be informed to make the best choice for their family. The choice to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> with the children or work in the labor market is based on the perceived value a family puts on a parent <b>staying</b> <b>home.</b> Some of the duties of a typical stay-home parent include cooking, cleaning, laundering, childcare, and driving. Using three {{levels of education}} including high school, college, and professional school graduates an income will be established that parents may use {{to determine whether or not}} they should <b>stay</b> <b>home.</b> Opportunity cost, market equivalents of services, and reservation wage will all be used to determine at what level parents will <b>stay</b> <b>home.</b> Financially, if a parent makes more than the average salary of someone performing the average household tasks, they should choose to enter the labor force once again. Otherwise it is beneficial to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> and raise the child and forgo the potential market wage...|$|R
40|$|Access to paid {{sick days}} (PSD) differs by {{workplace}} size, race/ethnicity, gender, and {{income in the}} United States. It is not known to what extent decisions to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> from work when sick with infectious illnesses such as influenza depend on PSD access, and whether access impacts certain demographic groups more than others. We examined demographic and workplace characteristics (including access to PSD) associated with employees' decisions to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> from work for their own or a child's illness. Linking the 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) consolidated data file to the medical conditions file, we used multivariate Poisson regression models with robust variance estimates to identify factors associated with missed work for an employee's own or a child's illness/injury, influenza-like-illness (ILI), and influenza. Controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, education, and income, access to PSD {{was associated with a}} higher probability of <b>staying</b> <b>home</b> for an employee's own illness/injury, ILI, or influenza, and for a child's illness/injury. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with a lower prevalence of <b>staying</b> <b>home</b> for the employee's own or a child's illness compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Access to PSD was associated with a significantly greater increase in the probability of <b>staying</b> <b>home</b> among Hispanics than among non-Hispanic Whites. Women had a significantly higher probability of <b>staying</b> <b>home</b> for their child's illness compared to men, suggesting that women remain the primary caregivers for ill children. Our results indicate that PSD access is important to encourage employees to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> from work when sick with ILI or influenza. Also, PSD access may be important to enable stay-at-home behavior among Hispanics. We conclude that access to PSD is likely to reduce the spread of disease in workplaces by increasing the rate at which sick employees <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> from work, and reduce the economic burden of <b>staying</b> <b>home</b> on minorities, women, and families...|$|R

40|$|This study {{compared}} the gender roles {{and attitudes toward}} women‟s and men‟s social roles of <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> fathers and employed fathers recruited on the Internet. The relationship between gender roles and attitudes toward women‟s and men‟s social roles on reasons for becoming a <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> father were also investigated. It was predicted that <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> fathers would endorse more traditionally feminine characteristics for themselves and would have more nontraditional attitudes toward men‟s and women‟s social roles than employed fathers. In addition, {{it was predicted that}} fathers who choose to <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> for practical reasons (i. e. lost job) would be more traditional in their gender role attitudes than fathers who choose to <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> for other reasons (i. e. really wanted to care for the children). Although <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> and employed fathers reported having similar feminine and masculine characteristics, <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> fathers reported having less traditional gender role attitudes than employed fathers. Biosocial theory (Eagly & Wood, 1999) suggests that <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> fathers may have less traditional attitudes about gender roles because the gender role they are acting out is a non-traditional role for men. <b>Stay</b> at <b>home</b> fathers reported that they really wanted to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> with their children more than any other reason, whereas the least reported reason for choosing to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> was having a child with special needs. Contrary to a prediction based on evolutionary psychology, <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> and employed fathers also reported that their children resembled them to the same degree. The results of this study will contribute further information about a group of fathers that have been under-studied and may also provide helpful information to support groups for <b>stay</b> at <b>home</b> and employed fathers.
