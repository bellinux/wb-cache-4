40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{reports have}} {{indicated}} {{an excess of}} leukaemia in Broome County, New York, particularly in the Town of Union. Surveillance of cancer incidence data indicates that {{a large proportion of}} these cases occurred among males ages 65 <b>and</b> older. <b>Shoe</b> <b>and</b> <b>boot</b> manufacturing has been the largest single industry in this area throughout much of the past century. Occupational studies from Europe suggest a link between leukaemia and employment in the <b>shoe</b> <b>and</b> <b>boot</b> manufacturing industry. However, researchers have not found a positive association between leukaemia and employment in the shoe industry among workers in the United States. Methods A matched case-control study was conducted to investigate the association between leukaemia incidence among males 65 and older and employment in the <b>shoe</b> <b>and</b> <b>boot</b> manufacturing industry. Thirty-six cases of leukaemia occurring between 1981 – 1990; among males age 65 and older; residing in the town of Union met the study case criteria. Death certificates were obtained for each of the cases. These were matched to death certificates of 144 controls on date of death and date of birth +/- 1 year. Death certificates were then examined to determine the employer and occupation of each study subject. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine the risk of leukaemia among those working in the industry. Results The risk of both leukaemia (OR = 1. 47; 95 % CI 0. 70, 3. 09) and acute myeloid leukaemia (OR = 1. 19; 95 % CI 0. 33, 4. 28) were elevated among those employed in the <b>shoe</b> <b>and</b> <b>boot</b> manufacturing industry, however neither was statistically significant. Conclusion The results, though suggestive of an association between leukaemia and employment in the <b>shoe</b> <b>and</b> <b>boot</b> manufacturing industry, were not statistically conclusive due mainly to limited study power. Several additional limitations may also have prevented the observance of more conclusive findings. Better exposure assessment, information on length of exposure and types of job held, control of confounding factors and information on chemicals used by this company would strengthen any future investigation. </p...|$|R
