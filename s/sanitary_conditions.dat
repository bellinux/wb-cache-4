40|$|Indices to {{the state}} of health or <b>sanitary</b> <b>condition</b> of a {{community}} are of the utmost importance to all, and especially so to those who are responsible for local sanitary provisions; and hence it is often asked, how far is the general death-rate of any year to be relied upon as a test of either the health or <b>sanitary</b> <b>condition</b> of any place or country ? I shall this evening try to demonstrate that the general death-rate of any one place, though in itself due to a combination of many complex causes, may, nevertheless, be used as a fairly reliable local index to health and <b>sanitary</b> <b>condition,</b> although a most faulty index as regards the comparative health or the <b>sanitary</b> <b>condition</b> of different localities...|$|R
