In soilless production system, {{many types of}} growing media or substrates such as rockwool, perlite, vermiculite and peat {{have been used to}} grow many kinds of crops. Alternative substrates that are cheaper and locally available such as coconut fibres and burnt paddy husks should be used as alternative media. The main objective {{of the study was to}} determine the most suitable organic growth substrate for cultivation of ginger using fertigation technique.

40|$|Liquid organic {{fertilisers}} allow growers {{to abandon}} the use of conventional de novo (mined or synthesised) fertilisers without major technological adaptions to the cultivation system. In prior experiments the conversion by aerobic substrate born bacteria of ammonium into nitrate was plant growth limiting. To improve the formulation of a commercial liquid organic fertiliser by increasing the nitrate concentration, a simple bench scale moving bed bioreactor of 20 L volume was constructed and used in continuous mode. The objective was to convert 80 % {{or more of the}} organic N present in the original liquid organic fertiliser into nitrate. In the bioreactor we used naturally occurring aerobic nitrifying soil bacteria. Bacterial material from a soil sample was multiplied in vitro in selective media. The bioreactor was inoculated with ammonia and nitrite oxidising bacteria. Bacteria were maintained on a bio-carrier with a high specific surface area and a low specific mass. The bioreactor was aerated from below which allowed the bio-carrier to float and <b>fertiliser</b> <b>solution</b> could freely reach all bacterial mass. After initial inoculation, bacteria established themselves on the bio-carrier over a three week period after which accumulation of nitrite ended and stable production of nitrate as an only product of nitrification started. The nitrate production was monitored for several months during which it produced continuously. The bioreactor was supplied with <b>fertiliser</b> <b>solution</b> containing 6 mmol L- 1 (total N, no nitrate). Over 90 % of nitrogen supplied was converted to nitrate. Influent hydraulic retention time in the bioreactor was around 12. 5 h. In conclusion, in line continuous conversion of liquid organic-N fertiliser into nitrate can be achieved for over 90 % by a simple and reliable technique. The technique may be used by growers supported by the fertiliser industry or may be scaled to pre-treat commercial liquid organic fertilisers before marketing...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} the anthropogenic emissions of non-CO 2 greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide. In this paper, a review is presented of the agriculture related sources of methane and nitrous oxide, and of the main strategies for mitigation. The rumen {{is the most important}} source of methane production, especially in cattle husbandry. Less, but still substantial, amounts of methane are produced from cattle manures. In pig and poultry husbandry, most methane originates from manures. The main sources of nitrous oxide are: nitrogen fertilisers, land applied animal manure, and urine deposited by grazing animals. Most effective mitigation strategies for methane comprise a source approach, i. e. changing animals¿ diets towards greater efficiencies. Methane emissions, however, can also be effectively reduced by optimal use of the gas produced from manures, e. g. for energy production. Frequent and complete manure removal from animal housing, combined with on-farm biogas production is an example of an integrated on-farm <b>solution.</b> Reduced <b>fertiliser</b> nitrogen input, optimal fertiliser form, adding nitrification inhibitors, land drainage management, and reduced land compaction by restricted grazing are the best ways to mitigate nitrous oxide emissions from farm land, whereas, management of bedding material and solid manure reduce nitrous oxide emissions from housing and storage. Other than for methane, mitigation measures for nitrous oxide interact with other important environmental issues, like reduction of nitrate leaching and ammonia emission. Mitigation strategies for reduction of the greenhouse gases should also minimize pollution swapping...|$|R
40|$|Mineral {{elements}} in soil solutions {{are thought to}} be the precursor of the formation of reactive minerals, which {{play an important role in}} global carbon (C) cycling. However, information regarding the regulation of mineral elements release in soil is scarce. Here, we examined the long-term (i. e., 23 yrs) effects of fertilisation practices on Fe minerals in a red soil in Southern China. The results from chemical analysis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that long-term swine manure (M) treatment released greater amounts of minerals into soil <b>solutions</b> than chemical <b>fertilisers</b> (NPK) treatment, and Fe played a dominant role in the preservation of dissolved organic C. Furthermore, Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge fine structure spectroscopy demonstrated that reactive Fe minerals were mainly composed of less crystalline ferrihydrite in the M-treated soil and more crystalline goethite in the NPK-treated soil. In conclusion, this study reported spectroscopic evidence of the improvement of reactive Femineral content in the M-treated soil colloids when compared to NPK-treated soil colloids...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Tomatoes {{were grown}} {{in a plastic}} {{greenhouse}} under 2 irrigation programmes and four N-fertiliser concentrations (0, 100, 150 and 200 mg N l- 1) of irrigation water. P and K concentrations were kept constant at 30 and 200 mg l- 1, respectively, for all N treatments. A drip irrigation system with single laterals centred between the plant rows, spaced 50 cm apart was used for irrigation {{as well as for}} feeding <b>fertiliser</b> <b>solution</b> (i. e. fertigation) during the experiment. Tensiometers, installed in 3 replicates at 45 cm soil depth and centred mid-way between 2 plants in rows, were used for irrigation scheduling. Two irrigation programmes, controlled through continuous monitoring of root-zone soil-water tension, were used as irrigation treatments. In one of the treatments, irrigation scheduling was based on a maximum soil-water tension of 50 kPa during the entire season. In the second treatment, soil-water tension to initiate irrigation was initially high (70 kPa), until fruit stetting, and it fell down to 50 kPa, later in the season. 15 N labelled urea was used in one of the N-concentration treatments (150 mg N l- 1) to estimate tomato N-fertiliser recovery. The results showed that tomato yield was not influenced significantly by irrigation treatments, although the irrigation treatment of low soil-water tension (£ 50 kPa), maintained throughout the season, gave higher yield. Exposing tomatoes to high soil water stress during the early growth stage, first 70 kPa then dropping to 50 kPa, promotes proportionally higher uptake of soil N, and thus reduces the recovery of applied N-fertiliser. However, when low soil water tension (£ 50 kPa) was maintained throughout the season, N-fertiliser recovery was 22. 4 % higher compared with when high soil water-tension prevailed until mid season. As for the effects of N concentration of the feeding solution, tomatoes showed a statistically significant (P £ 0. 05) fruit...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{the carbon}} stocks under {{different}} soil water and nutrient conditions were studied in Eucalyptus globulus Labill. {{stands in a}} field experiment, at O ´ bidos (central Portugal). The treatments were irrigation plus a complete <b>fertiliser</b> <b>solution</b> to simulate ‘near optimal’ nutrition (IF), irrigation only (I), and fertilisers added to rain-fed plots (F). The control (C) received neither water nor fertilisers (except a small amount at planting). The production of biomass (aboveground), the litterfall and the soil chemical composition were evaluated regularly during the experiment. Root biomass was estimated {{at the end of}} the experiment. Carbon in biomass, litterfall and soil, increased significantly when water and/or nutrients were supplied, in comparison to the control. The amount of carbon accumulated in the system, 6 years after planting, was 8. 22, 10. 22, 11. 23 and 13. 76 kg C m 2 in the control, F, I and IF treatments, respectively. The increase of carbon in the system during the same period was 5. 86, 7. 86, 8. 87 and 11. 40 kg C m 2 in the control, F, I and IF treatments, respectively. This rise in carbon resulted from the accumulation of long-lived woody biomass, which represented between 77. 7 (in IF) and 82. 9 % (in the control) of the total rise in carbon. Although water was the main limiting factor for biomass accumulation, the allocation of carbon to the soil was mainly related to nutrient supply, irrespective of water availability. The amount of carbon stored belowground, i. e. soil and forest floor, plus stumps and roots, reached 4. 2, 4. 7, 4. 8 and 6. 3 kg C m 2 in the control, F, I and IF treatments, respectively. The increase in C in the mineral soil regarding the initial state was, in the same order as above, 0. 21, 0. 75, 0. 58 and 1. 21 kg C m 2. These values were 3. 6, 9. 6, 6. 6 and 10. 6 % of the C accumulated in the whole system, during the experimental period...|$|R
40|$|Trace element {{deficiencies}} {{represent an}} ongoing limitation to agricultural productivity in Southern Australia {{and in many}} regions of the world. Trace element deficiencies are commonly encountered on alkaline and calcareous soils due to their high metal adsorption and fixation capacities. Chelating agents, such as EDTA, {{have been used to}} reduce fertiliser fixation in these soils and increase trace element transport to the rhizosphere. However, EDTA, which is the most commonly used chelating agent, can be relatively ineffective on alkaline soils and may have negative environmental implications due to its long-term persistence. This study has identified two novel sequestering agents for use on alkaline and calcareous soils. The novel products differ significantly from EDTA in terms of their structure and functionality. For example, rhamnolipid is synthesised by Pseudomonas bacteria, is nontoxic, biodegradable and forms a lipophilic complex with cationic metal ions. The other chelating agent, polyethylenimine (PEl) can complex up to 4 times more metal (g Cu(II) /g ligand) than EDTA, which has important implications for chelate application rates and the cost effectiveness of chelate use. In solution culture experiments, rhamnolipid and PEl facilitated Zn absorption into the root symplast; the kinetic rate of Zn absorption was greater than that of ZnC 12 alone. On alkaline and calcareous soils the novel products were significantly (PO. 05) more effective Zn sources than EDTA or the SO 24 -salt. EDTA increased the concentration of Zn in soil solution. However, this did not translate to increased Zn uptake by canola plants. This was not surprising as EDT A inhibited Zn absorption by roots in the solution culture experiments. Radioisotope experiments showed that rhamnolipid and PEl increased Zn adsorption to the soils solid phase. However, PEl increased the size of the total Zn labile pool (P O. 05) increase the total size of the Zn labile pool in either soil, but significantly (PO. 05) increase Zn absorption by live leaf tissue. Therefore, there was no discemable relationship between the Kc/w of <b>fertiliser</b> <b>solutions</b> and Zn permeability. This body of work has important implications for future fertiliser development, the cost effectiveness of chelate use and the treatment of micronutrient deficiencies on alkaline soils in the world today.

40|$|This {{research}} has been directed at furthering the utilization of crude glycerol oversupply formed as a by-product from the biodiesel manufacturing process. Phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups is a synthetic route that was investigated for the conversion of glycerol into a glycerol-phosphate (GPE) ester mixture. The process investigated for the synthesis of a GPE product was based on phosphorylation reaction procedures that were previously reported in the literature. The reaction to convert glycerol into a GPE mixture has been thoroughly investigated and the hydrogen chloride gas formed as a reaction by-product has been optimized. The chemical properties of GPE have been studied and discussed together with a mass balance of the overall glycerol phosphorylation process. The phosphate groups contained in polyhydric phosphate molecules have a potential chelating effect on cations. There are several cations that may be chelated by the phosphate ester group of polyhydric phosphate molecules. These cations include ammonium (NH 4 +), Potassium (K+), Calcium (Ca 2 +) etc, which are essential as nutrients in plant fertilizer formulations. This {{research has}} investigated {{the use of a}} GPE synthesized from glycerol in the laboratory and the use thereof as a phosphorus containing base in the formulation and evaluation of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK) containing fertilizer solution, Ammonium-Potassium-Glycerol-Phosphate (APGP) fertilizer solution. The APGP fertilizer solution has further been evaluated by growing two week old tomato seedlings under controlled conditions. The performance of the APGP <b>fertiliser</b> <b>solution</b> has been evaluated using design of experiments by comparison with traditionally used liquidAmmonium-Potassium-Phosphate inorganic fertilizer. This fertilizer solution has been prepared in similar manner as APGP formulation with the difference between them being the source of phosphorus. The results have been evaluated using statistic analysis where {{a significant difference between the}} evaluated fertilizer formulations was found. The comparative study of these formulations was monitored by the observed plant weights. A blank treatment was used as a control to determine if a significant difference among these formulations was observed. Anova single factor and t-Test methods (Two-Samples assumed of equal variances) are statistical models that were applied to interpret the observed experimental data with respect to wet and dry weighed masses of tomato seedlings. These methods indicated a confirmed conclusion that there was a significant difference between APPO 4 solution and APGP solution. The observed data have shown that the APPO 4 solution provided significantly better fertigation performance than APGP solution. Consequently, further investigation has been conducted to determine the cause of the poorer performance of the APGP solution. The further study of the APGP fertilizer solution included nutrient stability testing, biological analysis and other observed physical changes of the APGP solution over time. Biological results have revealed the presence of a Fusarium fungus species that has grown and is suspended in APGP fertilizer solution. This microbe species has been observed to play a vital role in consuming fertilizer nutrients. In addition, the observed abnormal plant growth and nutrient decomposition of the APGP formulation has been proposed to be mostly a result of the pathogenicity of the fusarium fungi species that was suspended in the APGP solution. Further work has been proposed in which the effect of such biological contamination is eliminated through adequate sterilization procedures and the APGP formulation re-evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Although Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae) is {{the major}} vector of dengue, Aedes albopictus (Stegomyia albopicta) Skuse has also been implicated in dengue outbreaks. These species are also vectors of the {{increasingly}} prevalent chikungunya virus. Larval surveys of natural and artificial containers in a small rural community in Manufahi, Timor-Leste over the past 3 years in wet and dry seasons (See Chapter 4) have found Ae. albopictus to be common, but Ae. aegypti was not detected, although this species is present in some other parts of Timor-Leste. Ovitraps (mosquito egg traps) {{have been widely used}} in monitoring Aedes mosquitoes, and lethal or autocidal ovitraps have been used as components of dengue control programs. Enhancing ovitraps with attractants or oviposition stimulants improves their efficacy, as does placing them in locations where they will be most likely to be detected by gravid females. Inexpensive, non-toxic, autocidal ovitraps constructed from recycled materials were used to compare known oviposition attractants or stimulants, singly and in combination. The attractants were: (a) a compound found in Aedes eggs (dodecanoic acid); (b) components of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium-based (NPK) fertilizer, and (c) infusions of discarded cigarette butts. A solution of ammonium phosphate and potassium nitrate received significantly more Ae. albopictus eggs than water only (control). Dodecanoic acid and cigarette butt infusions did not receive significantly more eggs than the control; however, they attracted various other Diptera and many non-culicid larvae developed in ovitraps in which these substances were used; thus, the presence of eggs or larvae of other species may have deterred Aedes oviposition. Significantly more Aedes eggs were found in ovitraps under vegetation than in ovitraps placed inside houses or against external walls. Clear-sided ovitraps in which black mesh was placed over a black ring floating on the water surface collected significantly fewer eggs than black ovitraps with identically placed mesh and rings. Responses of gravid Ae. aegypti to various attractants were assessed by oviposition choice experiments in the laboratory, using single caged mosquitoes. Response was evaluated by comparison of egg counts, and in some cases by assessment of modification of the skip oviposition tendency. Significantly more eggs were laid in cups containing a commercial NPK fertiliser, combined ammonium phosphate and potassium nitrate solution (20 mg/L N), or dilute pepper infusion than in cups containing water only. Fewer eggs were laid in cups containing ammonium phosphate or potassium nitrate or ammonium sulphate solutions (20 mg/L N) than in cups containing a combination of ammonium phosphate and potassium nitrate. No eggs were laid in cups containing concentrated pepper infusion. Approximately 14 % of females did not exhibit skip oviposition at baseline. NPK solution, a <b>solution</b> of NPK <b>fertiliser</b> and pepper infusion modified the skip oviposition tendency to some extent. To be effective, ovitraps should be at least as attractive to gravid females as alternative natural or artificial oviposition sites. In the wet season, larval Ae. albopictus are frequently found in rainwater-filled broken coconut shells and experiments were conducted to assess factors affecting their attractiveness as oviposition sites. In field experiments, coconut shells containing Stage 3 and 4 larval Armigeres received significantly fewer eggs than coconut shells without larval Armigeres. Ar. malayi and Ar. milnensis had not previously been recorded in Timor-Leste, until this field study...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{relationship between}} riparian arachnids and aquatic insect productivity was assessed in forest streams throughout the central South Island of New Zealand. Initially, a {{survey was conducted}} of thirty seven, first-third order forest streams. Streams were selected to represent a range of benthic invertebrate standing crops (as a surrogate measure of "productivity") from Banks Peninsula streams with relatively high benthic invertebrate densities to acid mine drainage streams near Reefton that were almost devoid of aquatic life. At each site benthic invertebrate densities and biomass were measured in riffle habitats and adjacent gravel bars were sampled for terrestrial invertebrates. At a sub-set of 16 sites, a 20 metre longitudinal web-building spider survey was conducted along each bank of the stream. As an additional component, a 20 metre transect starting at the stream margin and running perpendicularly into the forest was used to survey the density of web-building spiders with increasing distance from the stream. Results from the survey of in-situ stream insect biomass and gravel bar invertebrates showed a strong relationship between aquatic insect biomass and the biomass of riparian arachnids (R 2 = 0. 42, P < 0. 001) having accounted for potentially confounding factors such as stream size, elevation, substrate and disturbance. The 20 metre longitudinal survey showed that streams with the highest in-situ insect biomass had significantly higher densities of web-building spiders along their banks (R 2 = 0. 28, P < 0. 05), having accounted for potential confounding variables of elevation, habitat architecture and stream and channel width. The stream to forest survey showed a strong exponential decay in web-building spider densities with increasing distance from the stream (R 2 = 0. 96, P < 0. 0001). Regardless of stream productivity web-building spiders were most abundant at the stream margins and rapidly declined to very low densities 20 metres from the stream. In order to further test the relationship between riparian web-building spider densities and stream insect productivity, a stream fertilization experiment was conducted on six first-second order streams in the Maimai experimental catchment, Reefton. Three streams were enriched {{by the addition of}} a <b>fertiliser</b> <b>solution</b> mainly consisting of sodium nitrate for seven months, and the other three streams were used as controls. Water chemistry, benthic invertebrate communities, emerging aquatic adults, and the densities of web-building spiders along the stream corridor and in the forest were monitored in three seasons (spring, summer and autumn) {{over the course of the}} nutrient-addition. By the end of the experiment, conductivity was significantly higher in nutrient-addition streams than in the control streams (F = 80. 5, P < 0. 001), but chlorophyll concentrations showed no significant differences between treatments. Both benthic mayfly densities (F = 6. 15, P < 0. 05) and the biomass of adult aquatic dipterans (Chironomidae, Simuliidae) (F = 9. 25, P < 0. 01) were significantly higher in nutrient-addition streams in the last sampling round. Spiders recorded from intercept traps indicated that by the end of the experiment spider activity was significantly higher within 2. 5 metres of the nutrient-addition streams (F = 5. 70, P < 0. 01). However, seasonal densities of web-building spiders along the stream margin and in the forest decreased with no significant differences observed between nutrient-addition and control streams. The results from these studies indicate that adult insects emerging from streams represent an important source of prey that could influence the biomass and abundance of riparian arachnids. Additionally, the results imply that stream productivity and size could mediate the strength of the interaction between riparian and stream habitats. Moreover, feedback mechanisms present in both systems could have implications for such interactions. The elevated densities of web-building spiders observed at the stream margin led to the proposal of the "Highway Robber" hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that such higher densities of spiders are the result of increased insect activity along the stream corridor: the emergence of adult aquatic insects was predicted to vary less over temporal and spatial scales than that of terrestrial insects due to the poorly synchronized life histories in many New Zealand stream insects. I conclude by suggesting that there are numerous anthropocentric perturbations such as loss of heterogeneity, introduced species, pollution and habitat degradation that could undermine and decouple the intimate linkages between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems...|$|R
