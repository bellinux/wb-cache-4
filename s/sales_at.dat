5|$|Fluorite mining, which {{supplies}} most global fluorine, {{peaked in}} 1989 when 5.6 {{million metric tons}} of ore were extracted.

Blechman, Assistant Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, testified that the US reductions in foreign arms transfers had actually encouraged other nations and increased worldwide arms <b>sales.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, there was considerable pressure to provide a suitable aircraft for Taiwan.|$|E

Voorhis also opposed dominance of big business in the war effort. Congress, for the most part, ignored Voorhis's pleas.|$|E
