25|$|Opened in 1951 as {{a school}} for {{visually}} impaired pupils, Exhall Grange was the first school to cater exclusively for partially <b>sighted</b> <b>children.</b> It later widened its remit to include pupils with other disabilities, and became a grammar school in 1960. Under the stewardship {{of one of its}} best known headmasters, George Marshall OBE, the school gained an international reputation for the quality of its education, while Marshall himself became a leading expert on the education and welfare of visually impaired people. Marshall's successor, Richard Bignell, steered the school towards a more comprehensive approach to education, and as a visually impaired person himself championed the use of computers as an aid to learning.|$|E
25|$|Exhall Grange School was {{established}} in 1951 {{on the site of}} a former Second World War army base, and began life with twelve pupils. The school originally specialised in teaching pupils with visual impairment, and was the first purpose-built school for partially <b>sighted</b> <b>children</b> to be opened in the United Kingdom. Among its features was specially designed lighting to help pupils read and navigate their way around more easily. The school later began to extend its facilities and to enrol students with other disabilities, while in 1960 a grammar school department was added to enable disabled students from across the United Kingdom to attain a grammar school level of education. It was, for many years, predominantly a boarding school with pupils attending from across the United Kingdom, and it was regarded as being among the best in its field.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{was born}} on February 19, 1846 at his family's home on Friend's Run, near Franklin in Pendleton County, Virginia (now West Virginia). His father, Colonel Jacob F. Johnson, was a {{prominent}} citizen of the county and served in the West Virginia Legislature from 1872 to 1873. Johnson's grandfather, James Johnson, represented Pendleton County in the Virginia General Assembly {{and was a member}} of the 1829 Virginia Constitutional Convention. Like his elder brother James, Johnson was born with severe visual impairment which became total blindness several years after his birth. His affluent parents were determined to prepare Johnson and his brother for the challenges of life by providing them with the opportunities afforded to <b>sighted</b> <b>children,</b> arranging for their sons to receive a good education and [...] "proper instruction" [...] and teaching them self-sufficiency. Johnson's father employed a governess to instruct him and his brother at home, and James was taught to read from books using braille.|$|E

[...] The free program offers free books and kits to promote literacy among blind children of preschool and early elementary age. The dots in this program are very important and parallel with the literacy requirements of a <b>sighted</b> <b>child</b> learning their ABCs. It also helps grab a blind child's interest {{in the same way}} that a picture book encourages literacy for a <b>sighted</b> <b>child.</b>|$|R

500|$|James (Howard's brother) {{enrolled}} at the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind in Staunton in 1848 at age ten, completing his coursework there in 1855. After his graduation Johnson's father urged James to become a teacher, and at age 17 he taught a summer school on the South Fork South Branch Potomac River. James was also Howard's primary instructor, preparing him for higher education. Johnson followed in his brother's footsteps two years later, enrolling at the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind at age eleven. Although he studied there for four years, the school closed after the 1861 outbreak of the American Civil War and {{he was unable to}} complete his education there. At Staunton, teachers and acquaintances acknowledged Johnson's [...] "remarkably rapid" [...] progress in his studies. His studies were otherwise uninterrupted during the war; he attended a common school in Franklin, and was taught by James with <b>sighted</b> <b>children.</b> Johnson could not read text, and his lessons were read to him by his classmates.|$|E

50|$|The book Drawing and the Blind: Perceptions to Touch, by Jonathan Harchick, {{focuses on}} {{the ways in which}} the blind, both young and old, can {{perceive}} pictures and 3D objects. According to Harchick, visually impaired people are able to feel a 3D object and then create a drawing of the object that can be easily recognized by a sighted individual. Harchick likens the drawings of the average blind-since-birth person to those of a <b>sighted</b> <b>child.</b> He notices that blind children are much more willing to attempt to draw than blind adults who have no prior experience. Kennedy discusses the fact that the blind can perceive a drawing made of raised lines, as well as 3D objects that have shape and form.|$|R

50|$|Joseph Cutter and Lilli Nielsen, {{pioneers in}} {{research}} {{on the development of}} blind and multiple-handicapped children, have begun to introduce new research on mobility in blind infants in children. Cutter's book, Independent Movement and Travel in Blind Children, recommends a cane to be introduced as early as possible, so that the blind child learns to use it and move around naturally and organically, the same way a <b>sighted</b> <b>child</b> learns to walk. A longer cane, between nose and chin height, is recommended to compensate for a child's more immature grasp and tendency to hold the handle of the cane by the side instead of out in front. Mature cane technique should not be expected from a child, and style and technique can be refined as the child gets older.|$|R
50|$|With sight, {{much of what}} {{is learned}} by a child is learned through {{imitation}} of others, where as a visually impaired child needs very planned instruction directed at the development of postponed imitation. A visually impaired infant may jabber and imitate words sooner than a <b>sighted</b> <b>child,</b> but may show delay when combining words to say themselves, the child may tend to initiate few questions and their use of adjectives is infrequent. Normally the child's sensory experiences are not readily coded into language and this may cause them to store phrases and sentences in their memory and repeat them out of context. The language of the blind child does not seem to mirror their developing knowledge of the world, but rather their knowledge of the language of others.|$|R

50|$|Having {{taught at}} Stockingford County School in Nuneaton, in 1951 Marshall {{was one of}} the founders of Exhall Grange School, a {{boarding}} school based near Coventry, and the first purpose-built school for partially <b>sighted</b> <b>children</b> to be opened in the United Kingdom. He served as Deputy Headmaster from 1951 to 1953, then became Headmaster in 1953, a job he held until his retirement in 1981. He was the first of two headteachers of the school to have been Deputy Head before becoming the actual, when the preceder left; the other being the current Head, Christine Marshall. During his time at the school Marshall earned a national and international reputation as a campaigner for people with visual impairment, and a leading expert on the education of partially <b>sighted</b> <b>children.</b> His work includes developing prototype models of equipment, notably low vision aids, to help children with limited vision to read printed text, which were subsequently adopted by manufacturers. He was also regarded as a leading expert on matters relating to visual disability and eye conditions, publishing three books and over 40 pamphlets relating to the subject, explaining them in simple terms after identifying a need for parents with visually impaired children to have access to more information about their eye condition.|$|E
50|$|George Harold Marshall OBE (17 June 1916 - 4 October 1984) was a British schoolteacher, head master, author, {{academic}} and campaigner, internationally recognised {{for his work}} in the fields of education and assistive technology for children with visual disabilities. Marshall started Exhall Grange, Britain's first school to cater specifically for partially <b>sighted</b> <b>children</b> in 1951, becoming the third and was its head master from 1953 until he retired in 1981, making him to date the longest-serving person to hold that position.

By admitting able-bodied (and underprivileged) students, the school creates a unique atmosphere for the disabled students where they can mingle, interact and help each other. This helps develop their social skills and confidence. The school houses more than 500 students.|$|R
