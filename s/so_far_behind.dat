In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the agglutinin reactions in typhoid fever, leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the antibody response in typhoid, even though he was technically supposed to pursuing pathology as part of his obligations to the hospital.

The test, the first in which all teams used their 2009 cars, had BMW Sauber leading the times while Brawn GP finished fourth.

By 1996, Barbie's share had increased to 30%, estimated by Mattel to be worth £100m per year including licensing deals, and Sindy's share had only climbed to eight percent. Sindy's popularity had also been overtaken during that period by Polly Pocket. One explanation for the large variation in market share is the unpopular Americanisation of the Sindy doll in the mid-1980s. The Sindy doll was still available to retailers during this period, but had to be ordered in bulk from the Hong Kong manufacturer.|$|E

[...] Wright disagreed with this recollection, stating that the band had agreed to record only through the spring and early summer, and that he had no idea they were <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>behind</b> schedule.

[...] Waters, however, insisted that Wright leave, or he would refuse to release The Wall. Several days later, worried about their financial situation, and the failing interpersonal relationships within the band, Wright quit. News of his departure was kept from the music press.
