50|$|The first movement, 107 bars {{long and}} in common time, {{begins with a}} strong triple-playing of a C major chord. In typical sonata form, the work {{presents}} its main theme, and develops upon it. Toward the middle <b>section</b> (<b>bar</b> 40), the work drops down in tone to a darker, more ominous version of the main theme, before picking {{back up to the}} light C major chord.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} section, {{the left hand}} accompanies with a bass line written out in {{repeated}} quarter notes, in bars 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. This repeated note motif also appears in the first bar of the second <b>section</b> (<b>bar</b> 17, two Ds and a C), and, slightly altered, in bars 22 and 23. In the second section, Bach changes the mood slightly by introducing a few appoggiaturas (bars 19 and 20) and trills (bars 29-30).|$|E
50|$|There {{is a brief}} {{developmental}} <b>section</b> (<b>bar</b> 69) {{that includes}} modulation on the primary theme as well as inversions of the oboe lament. There is a recapitulation of all three themes (bar 93) though the orchestration is different, with the former violin theme (primary theme) now appearing in the horn and subsequently in the woodwinds. The second theme is recapitulated in its entirety in the tonic followed by a very short reappearance of the third theme.|$|E
5000|$|The final A {{section is}} a {{shortened}} {{repeat of the}} first one. In the last seven bars a most beautiful effect is produced by the repeated use of the chord of the Neapolitan sixth to delay the final cadence and especially by the [...] "unexpected gleaming" [...] of A major (bar 49) in the E-flat minor cadence. This A major enchantingly reflects the E major of the middle <b>section</b> (<b>bar</b> 24). The piece closes with a Picardy third, in E-flat major.|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>section</b> (<b>bars</b> 1-12), a Dorian mode melody sung by the soprano and alto {{voices in}} unison, which is {{accompanied}} by a counterpoint of the first and second violins, ends on [...] "autem crucis". The second <b>section</b> (<b>bars</b> 13-21), a fugato, modulates to B-flat major and ends on bars 20-21 in forte on [...] "exaltavit illum". The third <b>section</b> (<b>bars</b> 22-31), sustained by the strings and the trombones, ends in a climax in A-flat major on [...] "dedit illi nomen". The fourth <b>section</b> (<b>bars</b> 31-61) begins in pianissimo and in successive entries of the eight voices - from the lowest till the highest vocal parts - establishing a [...] "pyramid" [...] of sound based on a A-flat pedal tone, which leads the a further climax in C major. It is followed on bar 38 by a second [...] "pyramid", which follows the same procedure and ends in D major. The coda on [...] "quod est super" [...] begins on bar 45 with a third [...] "pyramid", which is charged with a greater dramatic effect, and ends on bars 51-53 with an a cappella climax in D minor. The second part of the coda (bars 53-61), sung a cappella, which is a clear quotation of the coda of the Kyrie of the Mass in E minor, ends in pianissimo in D major.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} <b>section</b> (<b>bars</b> 73-119) {{is formed}} of four parts. In the first tersely scored part, bars 73-89, the first subject is heard modulating through different minor keys {{with an almost}} constant stream of semiquavers running through the three parts.|$|R
5000|$|The C <b>section</b> (<b>bars</b> 137-177) {{contains}} [...] "one of {{the most}} dramatic showcases for the basset clarinet in the entire concerto, featuring spectacular leaps, together with dialog between soprano and baritone registers." [...] Starting in F Minor, this section eventually modulates back to A Major.|$|R
5000|$|This {{variation}} is a slow, gentle and richly decorated sarabande in [...] time. Most of the melody is written out using thirty-second notes, and ornamented {{with a few}} appoggiaturas (more frequent in the second section) and a few mordents. Throughout the piece, the melody is in one voice, and in bars 16 and 24 an interesting effect is produced {{by the use of}} an additional voice. Here are bars 15 and 16, the ending of the first <b>section</b> (<b>bar</b> 24 exhibits a similar pattern): ...|$|E
50|$|Where {{there is}} limited {{clearance}} such as in tunnels, the overhead wire may be replaced by rigid overhead rail. An early example was in the tunnels of the Baltimore Belt Line, where a ∏ <b>section</b> <b>bar</b> (fabricated from three strips of iron and mounted on wood) was used, with the brass contact running inside the groove. When the overhead line {{was raised in the}} Simplon Tunnel to accommodate taller rolling stock a rail was used. A rigid overhead rail may also be used in places where tensioning the wires is impractical, for example on moveable bridges. Short overhead conductor rails are also installed at tram stops as for the Combino Supra.|$|E
50|$|ECAE {{is unique}} because {{significant}} cold {{work can be}} accomplished without reduction in the cross sectional area of the deformed workpiece. In conventional deformation processes like rolling, forging, extrusion, and drawing, strain is introduced by reduction in the cross sectional area. ECAE produces significant deformation strain without reducing the cross sectional area. This is accomplished by extruding the work piece around a corner. For example, a square cross <b>section</b> <b>bar</b> of metal is forced through a channel with a 90 degree angle. The {{cross section of the}} channel is equal on entry and exit. The complex deformation of the metal as it flows around the corner produces very high strain. Because the cross section remains the same, a work piece can be extruded multiple times with each pass introducing additional strain.|$|E

50|$|The final <b>section</b> (<b>bars</b> 55-77) is a reprise of {{the opening}} theme, but with several modulations {{embedded}} within the final bars, all underpinned by a dominant pedal point. The tonic appears only very briefly in this final section and is not fully re-established until bar 69, which is effectively the coda.|$|R
50|$|Some {{sections}} {{of the rest of}} the route are of lower standard than that of those further east. Some traffic leaves for major holiday destinations such as Caernarfon or the Llŷn Peninsula, though much continues on to the port of Holyhead. As such part of the route is not classed as clearway and has two at grade junctions (roundabouts), Penmaenmawr (Junction 16) and Llanfairfechan (Junction 15). The Bangor bypass, in which the road previously terminated and became the A5 regains high standards and is such through the Anglesey <b>section,</b> <b>bar</b> the Britannia Bridge, which is a single carriageway deck above the North Wales Coast railway over the Menai Strait. In 2007 the Welsh Assembly Government undertook a consultation to determine which of four options would be preferred for a second crossing. This section intersects with the A487 towards Caernarfon, and the west coast of North Wales.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} {{opens with}} descending octaves [...] - [...] {{the first half}} of the fugato theme [...] - [...] under statements of the triplet theme which is its second half, in imitation between piano and cello. This leads to C minor, to an inverted statement of the fugue, to another episode-like <b>section</b> (<b>bar</b> 95, based on a part of the fugal opening first heard in bar 16; if this is not a fugue it is indeed very like) and after a brief section again in fugal imitation to a tense and tension-gaining section in true sonata style (bars 105 - 114, returning us to E minor, again based on the bar 16 figure) and a return to the main key, the second theme instead of the first, in triplets. After a repeat of the second theme, the opening fugato (what one calls a fugal section that's part of a larger movement rather than itself a fugue) returns, quoted in its entirety but staying in E minor rather than modulating to G, leading to the Più Presto coda.|$|E
50|$|Busy-sounding (but quiet) strings {{begin the}} final Allegro con spirito, again in sonata form. A loud section breaks in {{unexpectedly}} in bar 23 {{with the full}} orchestra. As the excitement appears to fade away, violins introduce a new subject in A major marked largamente (to be played broadly). The wind instruments repeat this until it develops into a climax. Bar 155 of the movement repeats the symphony's first subject again, but instead of the joyful outburst heard earlier, Brahms introduces the movement's development section. A mid-movement tranquillo <b>section</b> (<b>bar</b> 206, and reappearing in the coda) elaborates earlier material and slows down the movement to allow a buildup of energy into the recapitulation. The first theme comes in again (bar 244) and the familiar orchestral forte is played. The second theme also reappears in the tonic key. Towards {{the end of the}} symphony, descending chords and a mazy run of notes by various instruments of the orchestra (bars 395 to 412) sound out the second theme again but this time drowned out in a blaze of brass instruments as the symphony ends in a triumphant mood.|$|E
5000|$|The final <b>section</b> (<b>bars</b> 61-95) {{is a brief}} {{restatement}} of {{the opening}} theme with the transition into the coda beginning at bar 71. The coda proper begins at bar 75. Bar 89 onwards contains parallel motion in both hands played forte and leading directly into the final arpeggiated cadences played fortissimo.|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{the quality and}} its improvement of friction welded joints between a rectangular <b>section</b> <b>bar</b> and a circular <b>section</b> <b>bar.</b> Three kinds of rectangular section bars with different aspect ratio {{were used for the}} experiment. The rectangular section bars and circular section bars were joined by using a continuous drive(brake type) friction welding machine with an electromagnetic clutch in order to prevent a braking deformation during rotation stop. 　The low heat input friction welding method (LHI method) was used for joining. 　　The following conclusions were given. 　　(1) The first phase of the friction stage was composed of wear and seizure stages. 　This result was similar to the join of circular section bars of same diameter. 　　(2) When the areas of the weld faying surfaces were same each other，the initial torque and the elapsed time for initial torque hardly changed in spite of the aspect ratios of rectangular section bars. 　　(3) The welded joints obtained only the first stage (up to initial torque) had 100 ％ joint efficiency， but fractures occurred between the welded interface and base metal. When small aspcct ratios of rectangular section bars and a circular <b>section</b> <b>bar</b> were welded， several joints fractured at the base metal although they had a little defect in the welded interface. 　　(4) When the joints were made by the LHI method in Ar atmosphere， the welded joints had 100 ％ joint efficiency, but fractures occurred between the welded interface and base metal. 　　(5) The welded joints had 100 ％joint efficiency and fractured at the base metal when the joints were made by the LHI method with adding forge pressure (improving LHI method). 　On the other hand，most of the welded joints made by the conventional method with forge pressure had fractures occurred between the welded interface and base metal. 　　(6) The improving LHI method has more advantages than those welded by the conventional method,I. e. ，less burn-off,less burr and less deformation of welded interface area. As a conclusion，it was clarincd that the improving LHI method is the most effective friction welding method for rectangular section bars and circular section bars...|$|E
40|$|Extrusion of {{aluminium}} alloys is a complex process which depends {{on the characteristics of}} the material and on a process parameters (initial billet temperature, extrusion ratio, friction at the interfaces, die geometry etc.). The right choice of these parameters is fundamental to avoid surface damage of the extruded. One of the most important factors is the temperature profile. In the present work, a neural network has been implemented for optimizing the aluminium extrusion process, by determining the temperature profile of a Al 6060 alloy (UNI 9006 / 1) at the exit of the die. Parameters such as heating conicity at the entry of the die, permanence time in the induction heater and extrusion ratio have been varied. A three-layer neural network with back propagation (BP) algorithm has been trained with the experimental data from the industrial process. The experimental data refer to five different section bars, characterized by a specific extrusion ratio. For every <b>section</b> <b>bar</b> there is an optimal initial temperature profile of the billet, realized in the induction heater. The temperature has been controlled by five thermocouples allocated inside the induction heater to regular intervals. By means of optical pyrometry the instantaneous temperatures at the exit of the induction heater and of the die have been measured. It has been found that the temperature profile on the <b>section</b> <b>bar,</b> predicted by the neural network, closely agree whit experimental values. This indicates that the neural networks can be successfully used to predict the evolution of the extrusion process thus to control it...|$|E
