40|$|An image {{analysis}} method for real-time <b>surface</b> <b>blemish</b> detection using passive imagery and fuzzy set concepts is described. The method develops an internal knowledge representation for <b>surface</b> <b>blemish</b> characteristics {{on the basis}} of experience, thus facilitating autonomous learning based upon positive and negative exemplars. The method incorporates fuzzy set concepts in the learning subsystem and image segmentation algorithms, thereby mimicking human visual perception. This enables a generic solution for color image segmentation. This method has been applied in the development of ARIES (Autonomous Robotic Inspection Experimental System), designed to inspect DOE warehouse waste storage drums for rust. In this project, the ARIES vision system is used to acquire drum surface images under controlled conditions and subsequently perform visual inspection leading to the classification of the drum as acceptable or suspect...|$|E

40|$|AbstractForming limit {{diagrams}} (FLD's) {{are used}} to evaluate the workability of metal sheets. FLD's provide the failure locus at which plastic instability occurs and localized necking develops (commonly designated as the forming limit curve - FLC), and the failure loci at the onset of fracture by tension (FFL) or by in-plane shear (SFFL). The interest of metal formers in controlling localized necking is understandable because the consequence of plastic instability is an undesirable <b>surface</b> <b>blemish</b> in components. However, because under certain loading conditions fracture can precede necking in sheet metal forming processes, there is a growing interest in characterizing the forming limits by necking and fracture in the FLD's.

40|$|Advanced {{manufacturing}} techniques enable ultra-precision surfaces to be fabricated {{with various}} complicated and large-area structures. For instance, the cost-effectiveness of Roll-to-Roll (R 2 R) manufacturing {{technology has been}} widely demonstrated in industries making high volume as well as large-area foil products and flexible electronics. Evaluation of these fine surfaces by an expensive trial-and-error approach is unadvisable due to the high scrap rate. Therefore quality control using in-line metrology of the functional surface {{plays an important role}} in the success of employing R 2 R technology by enabling a high product yield whilst guaranteeing high performance and a long lifespan of these multi-layer products. This thesis presents an environmentally robust line-scan dispersive interferometry (LSDI) technique that is suitable for applications in in-line surface inspection. Obtaining a surface profile in a single shot allows this interferometer to minimise the effect of external perturbations and environmental noise. Additionally, it eliminates the mechanical scanning and has an extended axial measurement range without the 2 π phase ambiguity problem by dispersing the output of the spectrometer onto the camera. Benefiting from high-speed camera, general-purpose graphics processing unit and multi-core processor computing technology, the LSDI can achieve high dynamic measurement with a high signal-to-noise ratio and is effective for use on the shop floor. Two proof-of-concept prototypes aimed at different applications are implemented. The cylindrical lens based prototype has a large lateral range up to 6 mm and can be used for characterisation of additively manufactured surface texture, surface form and <b>surface</b> <b>blemish.</b> The second prototype using a 4 X microscope objective with a diffraction limited lateral resolution (4 µm) is aiming at characterisation of surface roughness, micro-scale defects, and other imperfections of the ultra-precision surfaces. System design, implementation, fringe analysis algorithms and system calibrations are presented in detail in this thesis. Their performances are evaluated experimentally by measuring several standard step heights as well as Al 2 O 3 coated polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) films. The measurement results acquired using both prototypes and a commercial available instrument (Talysurf CCI 3000) align with each other acceptably. This shows that the developed metrology sensors may potentially be applied to production lines such as R 2 R surface inspection where only defects present on the surface are concerned in terms of quality assurance. Implementation of these prototypes offers an attractive solution to improve manufacturing processing and reliability for the products in ultra-highprecision engineering...|$|E

40|$|Gypsum {{efflorescence}} (GE) on ceramic brick masonry {{is on the}} rise, {{with more}} buildings being affected every year by this <b>surface</b> <b>blemish.</b> Regardless of GE’s aesthetic impact only, this problem constitutes a considerable threat for the ceramic brick industry. Even though GE has been recognized for more than 3 decades (Chwast et al. 2015), a method for its assessment nor {{a solution to the}} problem is available. Salt crystallisation tests are widely applied to porous materials, however when adapted to GE reproduction they fail (Franke and Grabau 1998), or take too much time (Bowler and Winter 1997). The main aim of this study is hence to develop an effective test method which allows investigating factors responsible for the recent GE occurrences. Such method should reproduce GE within a reasonable period of time as well as be versatile. It should thus be easily adapted for testing (i) brick and cement as GE sources, (ii) effect of brick transport properties and (iii) mortar admixtures as potential factors triggering its abundant formation (Chwast et al. 2015). The method is developed based on a wick test, where a porous material (transport medium) is placed in a dish with a test solution (salts source). During the test (35 °C, 20 % RH) evaporation takes place solely over the brick core’s (transport medium) top surface, resulting in a continuous flow of salt solution and salts crystallisation. Our first trials have confirmed that a basic wick test does not result in gypsum deposition over the surface, but rather within or under, forming subflorescence instead. The method was hence modified to simulate rain episodes, by interrupting the wick process with frequent wetting steps. Effectively, this wick-wetting yields a considerable GE formation. The brick core is connected to the setups lid with a sealant. It is of great importance to cautiously choose the sealant type, as the commonly used silicones may greatly interfere with the gypsum crystallisation process, inducing formation of abundant crusts. It was hence decided to seal the setups with a hot-melt solvent-free sealant. Additionally, the brick core samples are subjected to a leaching procedure prior to the test. This treatment reduces the undesirable interference of salts originating from the brick cores. The brick cores’ surfaces are frequently photographed and the pictures are afterwards subjected to an image analysis procedure, allowing quantifying the efflorescence extent and its development tendency. The applied tests have revealed a complex nature of the GE problem. Both bricks and masonry mortar may contain GE sources. While these may be directly available in bricks, in mortar the GE source is formed upon carbonation. Nevertheless, GE source presence itself is not sufficient to yield abundant deposits as observed under field conditions, as gypsum exhibits an intrinsic pore clogging tendency, limiting the possible GE extent. This tendency can be overcome in presence of surface active mortar admixtures, which in turn can be deactivated when bound in a cement matrix. Bowler, G. K., and N. B.

Potatoes cooked in a microwave oven without pricking the skin might split open due to built up internal pressure from unvented steam. It takes between one and two hours to bake a large potato in a conventional oven at 200 C. Microwaving takes from six to twelve minutes depending on oven power and potato size, but does not generally produce a crisp skin. Some recipes call for use of both a microwave and a conventional oven, with the microwave being used to vent most of the steam prior to the cooking process.|$|R
5000|$|Sweet {{potatoes}} {{are susceptible to}} a number of fungi, bacteria and viruses.

These are responsible for 78% of sweet potato infections in Bangladesh. The pest of greatest concern for farmers is the sweet potato weevil (Cylas spp.). This can enter the tuber prior to harvesting and proliferate in storage and has been known to cause up to 50% loss in yields. Simple techniques can be used to minimize the threat of the sweet potato weevil. It has been shown that storage of the potatoes in temperatures under 20 C can kill up to 89.5% of weevils in an infected crop. Dipping of tubers in hot water also been shown as an effective intervention to control infestations [...] Damage to tuber by physical and physiological means can increase chance of pathological infection and pests.|$|R

40|$|Background: Two {{economic}} factors make watermelon worthy of consideration as a feedstock for ethanol biofuel production. First, about 20 % of each annual watermelon crop {{is left in}} the field because of <b>surface</b> <b>blemishes</b> or because they are misshapen; currently these are lost to growers {{as a source of}} revenue. Second, the neutraceutical value of lycopene and L-citrulline obtained from watermelon is at a threshold whereby watermelon could serve as starting material to extract and manufacture these products. Processing of watermelons to produce lycopene and L-citrulline, yields a waste stream of watermelon juice at the rate of over 500 L/t of watermelons.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine if organic apple growers could minimize losses to summer diseases on apples by using cultural management strategies and/or regular sprays of liquid lime sulfur (LLS). LLS is an OMRI-approved fungicide. Diseases of concern were black rot, flyspeck, and sooty blotch. The latter two diseases appear as dark-colored blemishes on apple fruit <b>surfaces.</b> Although these <b>blemishes</b> do not directly impact edibility, apple with these <b>surface</b> <b>blemishes</b> are not acceptable to fresh fruit buyers. Black rot is a fruit decay that makes fruit inedible, and fruit with black rot can add off-flavors if they are use for juice. During 2010, field trials {{were conducted}} in a Jonamac orchard at the Geneva Experiment Station and in a block containing the cultivars Royal Court and Cameo at the Hudson Valley Lab in Highland. Trees in replicated plots received either cultural controls alone, treatment with LLS alone, {{or a combination of}} cultural controls and LLS treatments. Cultural controls included removal of fruitlet mummies that can harbor black rot inoculum and hand-thinning of fruit in June followed by light summer pruning to enhance rapid drying following rains and dews and to allow improved spray coverage. Apples were harvested at commercial maturity and evaluated for disease. Both LLS and cultural controls reduced disease incidence and severity of sooty blotch and flyspeck at both test locations, and both approaches reduced the incidence of black rot at Geneva. Neither LLS, cultural controls, nor the combination of the two approaches were consistently effective against black rot in the Hudson Valley where hot humid summers favor this disease. At Geneva, fruit treated with LLS alone or in combination with cultural controls had no more summer diseases than fruit treated with conventional fungicides. However, conventional fungicide programs generally out-performed LLS against summer diseases in the Hudson Valley. This experiment verifies that LLS sprays can be used to control flyspeck and sooty blotch on organic apple farms, but neither LLS nor the cultural controls that we tested will control black rot on cultivars such as Royal Court that are highly susceptible to this disease...|$|R
40|$|In {{order for}} olives of the Manzanilla variety to be {{produced}} as Spanish-style, they require a previous storage period before their alkaline treatment with NaOH.

The objectives of this work were to investigate, at industrial scale, different alternatives to the holding period; specifically, the use of low-concentration alkaline solutions before the real alkaline treatment, and the use of alkaline solutions at low temperatures for this alkaline treatment. Basic parameters of the fermentative processes carried out in every treatment were monitored, and commercial quality of the final product was ascertained. The results indicate that both modifications are alternatives to the traditional treatment, and the products obtained applying these modifications have the same or higher quality than those obtained by the traditional process.

This system {{has been found to be}} useful for the development of image processing commands and algorithms to solve image processing problems. An image capture subsystem based around a 576 x 385 element frame transfer charge coupled device is described. This system has a variable integration time, giving it considerable flexibility over more conventional cameras. The properties of the RANK filter are described. The usefulness of this nonlinear filter is demonstrated by its performance on a number of common image processing tasks. The edge detection properties of RANGE filters, which are the difference between the outputs of two RANK filters, are discussed. This family of filters has considerable flexibility in the type of output response obtained, but was found to be slightly more sensitive to noise than the commonly used SOBEL filter. A new iterative solution to the Fourier phase retrieval problem is described. This solution is less efficient than current solutions, but does prove the optimality of an operation common to existing iterative methods of solution. An approach to developing algorithms to solve image processing problems is described. The various commands that may be used at each stage are discussed. Although this approach does not say which command should be used when, it does provide a guide. The algorithms developed for three applications are presented. These are: the calibration of a photoelastic material used in the measurement of the foot-ground pressure pattern of a standing person; the measurement of areas within stem disk growth rings; and the detection of <b>surface</b> <b>blemishes</b> of kiwifruit being graded for export...|$|R

Apple fruit were harvested in Fraiburgo (SC), São Joaquim (SC) and Vacaria (RS). Data on firmness, starch index (SI), soluble solid content (SS), titratable acidity (TA), size and grades (external appearance) of apple fruit were submitted to linear and nonlinear regression analyses. Each fruit was graded by analysis of external qualities (color and <b>surface</b> <b>blemishes)</b> following Brazilian legal standards. At apples industry, the harvest period extended from 3 rd to 15 th week {{of the year for}} ‘Gala’ and from 10 th to 22 nd week of the year for ‘Fuji’ apples, although approximately 70 % of total production for ‘Gala’ and ‘Fuji’ apples was harvested in a period of 4 and 6 weeks, respectively. Average maturity of 11 years varied from the 1 st to the last week of harvest as follows: ‘Gala’ apples: 17. 9 to 14. 2 pounds (firmness), 4. 0 to 6. 1 (SI), 12. 2 to 13. 1 % (SS) and 5. 7 to 3. 9 meq 100 mL- 1 (TA). ‘Fuji’ apples: 17. 1 to 14. 3 pounds (firmness), 3. 9 to 6. 4 (SI), 12. 9 to 14. 4 % (SS), 6. 2 to 3. 8 meq 100 mL- 1 (TA).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with machine vision including its application {{to the task of}} detecting <b>surface</b> <b>blemishes</b> and shape defects in kiwifruit at a rate of four fruit per second. Existing machine vision technology is subject to the twin constraints of large data volumes and restricted processing time. Two approaches to this problem are explored: the use of large processing power, and the reduction of the data volume. The provision of large processing power is achieved through the use of networks containing large numbers of micro-processors. The establishment of a Transputer Image Processing System (TIPS) has provided a test facility for the development of algorithms on a multitransputer system. In particular, distributed versions of the convex hull algorithm and of algorithms for image translation and rotation have been developed. The establishment of TIPS required the development of a shell to provide protection against deadlock and to provide a satisfactory environment for software development. The network topology is a significant factor in the system performance, and a particular network, the degree four chordal ring network, is proposed as a suitable network for transputer-based systems. The manner in which image processing operations map onto a multi-processor is also investigated. The alternative approach to a practical machine vision system is to decrease the volume of image data. This can be achieved using pyramidal vision, and the approach explored in this thesis uses a rank-based technique for the formation of each subsequent layer of the pyramid. In particular, a rank of one or two results in darker blemishes being emphasized relative to their surroundings. As a consequence, the volume of image data required to preserve blemish information is very much reduced. Another aspect of machine vision is lighting, and the problem of determining the optimum form of lighting for blemish detection on kiwifruit is explored. A machine vision system based on a combination of pyramidal vision and multi-transputer networks is proposed...|$|R

A minimum level of ~ 400 mg N/L (~ 15 μmol/ml amino nitrogen) in watermelon juice was required to achieve maximal fermentation rates when it was employed as the sole nitrogen source for the fermentation. Fermentation at pH 5 produced the highest rate of fermentation for the yeast system that was employed. Utilizing watermelon juice as diluent, supplemental feedstock, and nitrogen source for fermentation of processed sugar or molasses allowed complete fermentation of up to 25 % (w/v) sugar concentration at pH 3 (0. 41 to 0. 46 g ethanol per g sugar) or up to 35 % (w/v) sugar concentration at pH 5 with a conversion to 0. 36 to 0. 41 g ethanol per g sugar. Conclusion Although watermelon juice would have to be concentrated 2. 5 - to 3 -fold to serve as the sole feedstock for ethanol biofuel production, the results of this investigation indicate that watermelon juice, either as whole juice fermented on-site or as a waste stream from neutraceutical production, could easily integrate with other more concentrated feedstocks where it could serve as diluent, supplemental feedstock, and nitrogen supplement. </p...|$|R

This research explores automated visual inspection of surface defects in a light-emitting diode (LED) chip. Commonly found on chip <b>surface</b> are water-spot <b>blemishes</b> which impair the appearance and functionality of LEDs. Automated inspection of water-spot defects {{is difficult because}} they have a semi-opaque appearance and a low intensity contrast with the rough exterior of the LED chip. Moreover, the defect may fall across two different background textures, which further increases detection difficulties. The one-level Haar wavelet transform is first used to decompose a chip image and extract four wavelet characteristics. Then, wavelet-based principal component analysis (WPCA) and Hotelling statistic (WHS) approaches are respectively applied to integrate the multiple wavelet characteristics. Finally, the principal component analysis of WPCA and the Hotelling control limit of WHS individually judge the existence of defects. Experimental results show that the proposed WPCA method achieves detection rates of above 93. 8 % and false alarm rates of below 3. 6 %, and outperforms other methods. A valid computer-aided visual defect inspection system is contributed to help meet the quality control needs of LED chip manufacturers...|$|R
