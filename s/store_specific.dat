50|$|A {{combination}} {{action is}} a system designed to <b>store</b> <b>specific</b> organ registrations to be recalled instantaneously by the player while they are playing. It usually consists of several numbered pistons (buttons) situated {{in the space between}} the manuals at the organ console. The pistons control either the stops of the whole organ (in which case they are called general pistons or generals) or the stops of a particular division (in which case they are called divisional pistons or divisionals). Each piston is programmed by the organist with a particular registration to be activated when it is pressed. This allows the organist to change registrations on the fly, without the assistance of a registrant.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to shipping quickly, preparing for busy shopping seasons requires retailers {{to stock up}} on product ahead of time. For most retailers, the Christmas shopping season is the busiest of the year. Ahead of this time, a distribution center might double the amount of inventory on hand and then draw this level down through the shopping season. This strategy is especially important for imported items. With lead times measured in weeks or months, stocking these products in a distribution center is often the only way to maintain in-stocks at the store. New seasons, holidays, or special promotions may also prompt a retailer to <b>store</b> <b>specific</b> items prior to a large rollout or demand forecast.|$|E

5000|$|Research with amnesia {{patients}} {{suggests the}} [...] "Dual Factor approach" [...] {{may be the}} most accurate model. A series of experiments with amnesiac patients support the idea that AGL involves both abstract concepts and concrete exemplars. Amnesiacs were able to classify stimuli as [...] "grammatical" [...] vs. [...] "randomly constructed" [...] just as well as participants in the control group. While able to successfully complete the task, amnesiacs were not able to explicitly recall grammatical [...] "chunks" [...] of the letter sequence while the control group was able to explicitly recall them. When performing the task with the same grammar rules but a different sequence of letters than those that they were previously tested on, both amnesiacs and the control group were able to complete the task (although performance was better when the task was completed using the same set of letters used for training). The results of the experiment support the dual factor approach to artificial grammar learning in that people use abstract information to learn rules for grammars and use concrete, exemplar-specific memory for chunks. Since the amnesiacs were unable to <b>store</b> <b>specific</b> [...] "chunks" [...] in memory, they completed the task using an abstract set of rules. The control group was able to store these specific chunks in memory and (as evidenced by recall) did store these examples in memory for later reference.|$|E

40|$|Switched’: a {{singular}} case of store switching Purpose: To investigate {{the levels of}} store-switching for main food shopping consequent on a change in operator for a major superstore. To account for differences amongst switchers and non-switchers and to confirm/reject previous research findings. Design/methodology/approach: A two-phase random household postal survey on main food shopping behaviour was conducted in a central Scottish city. The two phases, separated by one year, bracketed the change of a main food store from Safeway to Morrisons. A proportion of respondent households in the two phases (45 %) was common and represents matched subjects, allowing investigation of switching behaviour. Findings: The aggregate switching rate is higher (27. 4 %) than found in previous UK research, despite the locational/accessibility component being held constant. No aggregate differences between switchers/non-switchers on socio-economic or demographic grounds were found, confirming previous US research. The high level of switching is ascribed to a re-evaluation of store choices/attributes consequent on the store changeover, confirming {{the notion of a}} ‘trigger ’ mechanism. Practical implications: The research has implications for competition authorities, other policy makers and retailers. It reveals the transient nature of a component of store loyalty and the <b>store</b> <b>specific</b> nature of store switching behaviour. Policy makers need to understand the baseline or natural switching rate amongst retailers generally and specifically in their area.

40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{the most}} common way to {{programmatically}} access Topic Maps data {{is the use of}} a Topic Maps API, like TMAPI. Another approach, besides the use of a query language like TMQL, is the encapsulation of the Topic Maps related code in domain-specific model classes. This concept is similar to object-relational mapping (ORM) which encapsulates access to a relational database inside the model classes. These techniques decouple the data <b>store</b> <b>specific</b> code from the business logic. For ORM, there are several prevalent design patterns, most notable the Active Record pattern by Fowler. For Topic Maps, no such pattern is established. This paper introduces Active Topic Maps, a pattern for Topic Maps – object mapping, the domain-specific language ActiveTMML to define such a mapping, and a prototypical implementation, called ActiveTM. ActiveTM is based on Ruby Topic Maps and also supports the generation of web-forms based on ActiveTMML definitions. This full-featured software stack greatly improves the development productivity of Topic Maps based portals compared to other solutions. ...|$|E

The abstract syntax tree is an essential data structures of (generated) programming environments. It enables the user of the environment to perform edit actions in a syntax directed way.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of coexistence of transmitters and of receptor-receptor interactions have increased {{our understanding of}} the integrative processes regulating synaptic homeostasis and synaptic plasticity. Depending upon the ionotropic or metabotropic characteristics of the cotransmitter, it may be mainly involved in synaptic homeostasis or synaptic plasticity, respectively. A chemical trace of the postsynaptic activity can be obtained because of the plasticity of the receptor molecules. Thus, the heuristic hypothesis is introduced that islands of receptors located on postsynaptic membranes of local circuits can be formed by means of receptor-receptor interactions favouring ordered electrotonic sequences in the local circuits. This hypothesis has been named the receptor mosaic hypothesis of the engram. The islands or clusters of receptors can then <b>store</b> <b>specific</b> and complex information and when activated by the transmitters they may induce unique changes in ion permeability and cell metabolism which, at the local circuit level, can mimic exactly a previous electrotonic sequence. They can therefore represent {{at least part of the}} engram. This hypothesis is introduced against the background of the possible existence of different types of encodings of memory...|$|E
