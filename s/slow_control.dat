40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{analyze the}} effect of clock slew in {{subthreshold}} circuits. Specifically, we address the issue that variations in clock slew at the register control can cause serious timing violations. We show that clock slew variations can cause frequency targets to deviate {{by as much as}} 28 % from the design goals. Based on these observations, we recognize the importance of clock <b>slew</b> <b>control</b> in subthreshold circuits. We propose a systematic approach to design the clock tree for subthreshold circuits to reduce the clock slew variations while minimizing the energy dissipation in the tree. The combined approach, including the wire sizing and dynamic nodal capacitance control, can achieve better <b>slew</b> <b>control</b> (and better timing control) at lower energy in subthreshold circuits.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} a maze-routing-based clock tree routing {{algorithm}} integrated with buffer insertion, buffer sizing, and topology generation that {{is able to}} consider general buffer insertion locations. While previous work on buffered clock tree synthesis restricts potential buffer locations on merge nodes in the clock tree topology, our proposed algorithm has more freedom and thus achieves more robust <b>slew</b> <b>control.</b> Buffer insertion along routing paths had been mostly avoided previously due {{to the difficulty of}} maintaining a low skew under such aggressive buffer insertion. We developed an accurate timing analysis engine for delay and slew estimations and a balanced routing scheme for better skew reduction during clock tree synthesis. As a result, we can perform aggressive buffer insertion and maintain accurate delay in-formation and low skew. Buffer sizing is also guided by its performance for <b>slew</b> <b>control.</b> Experiments show that our synthesis results not only honor the slew constraints but also maintain reasonable skew...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—New {{control system}} aspects are {{introduced}} {{for the design}} of <b>slow</b> <b>control</b> systems for physical experiments. Mainly, they are based on a comprehensive usage of XML technologies. A second paradigm for future control systems is the consequent usage of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Main aspect of all (hardware and software) system components is the use throughout of standards for interfaces, protocols and architecture. In particular, the software is based on the unifying XML specifications XSchema, XPath, XQuery, XLink and OPC XML. A first application of these technologies is the KATRIN <b>Slow</b> <b>Control</b> System (KSC) of a neutrino experiment at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. Main characteristic of KSC is its homogeneous structure with its code being spread over several sub-systems. Implications of this distributed method are system stability, independence of sub-systems and fast and comfortable maintenance...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose-: Moderate {{hypothermia}} {{has been}} found to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP) significantly in patients who have severe middle cerebral artery infarction. However, during passive rewarming, ICP continuously rises and some patients suffer transtentorial herniation. Methods-: We investigated the question of whether slower rewarming leads to slower increase in ICP and slower decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Furthermore, we studied feasibility of <b>slow,</b> <b>controlled</b> rewarming. ICP, CPP, and core body temperature were monitored continuously. Achievement of rewarming protocol was assessed by hit rate of temperature target intervals. Side effects of hypothermia were assessed. Results-: Rates of change of both ICP and CPP were correlated significantly with increase in temperature (ICP r = 0. 62, P = 0. 002; CPP r =- 0. 50, P = 0. 017). In feasibility analysis of 13 controlled rewarmed patients, hit rate of temperature target intervals was 63 % (median; range 48 % to 81 %); hit rate within the target interval or below was 79 % (median; range 62 % to 94 %). Conclusions-: <b>Slow,</b> <b>controlled</b> rewarming is feasible and may be used for ICP and CPP control after moderate hypothermia for space-occupying infarction...|$|R
