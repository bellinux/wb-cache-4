40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> indoor positioning using visible light systems. The directional detector array we use {{is comprised of}} a number of receiving elements, each consisting of an aperture and a photo diode, which are arranged to offer good angular diversity, and can be implemented within a compact receiver structure ref 1. The receiving elements receive the light from a number of white LEDs, which are typically attached to the ceiling, and which act as anchors. In order to get an indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> received signal <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different <b>LEDs,</b> we average <b>the</b> received signals over time. The relative signal strengths in the different receiving elements do not only provide information on the distance between <b>the</b> <b>LEDs</b> and <b>the</b> detector array, but also about <b>the</b> angle-of-arrival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light. By combining <b>the</b> information <b>of</b> <b>the</b> receiving elements, <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detector can be estimated. In order to assess <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> positioning algorithms based on this approach, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound on the position accuracy.

40|$|<b>The</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basal {{transcription}} factor TFIIE {{was investigated in}} RNA polymerase II transcription reactions reconstituted with purified proteins.

We propose that on negatively supercoiled templates TFIIE can facilitate promoter melting...|$|R
50|$|Infrared light {{makes up}} <b>the</b> {{invisible}} section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electromagnetic spectrum. This light, also classified as heat, transmits signals between the {{transmitter and receiver}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remote system. Telecommand systems usually include a physical remote, which contains four key parts: buttons, integrated circuit, button contacts, and a light-emitting diode. When the buttons on a remote are pressed they touch and close their corresponding contacts below them within the remote. This completes the necessary circuit on the circuit board along with a change in electrical resistance, which is detected by the integrated circuit. Based on the change in electrical resistance, the integrated circuit distinguishes which button was pushed and sends a corresponding binary code to <b>the</b> light-emitting diode (<b>LED)</b> usually located at <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remote. To transfer {{the information from the}} remote to <b>the</b> receiver, <b>the</b> <b>LED</b> turns <b>the</b> electrical signals into an invisible beam of infrared light that corresponds with the binary code and sends this light to the receiver. The receiver then detects the light signal via a photodiode and it is transformed into an electrical signal for the command and is sent to the receiver’s integrated circuit/microprocessor to process and complete <b>the</b> command. <b>The</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transmitting <b>LED</b> can vary and determines the required positioning accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remote in relevance to the receiver. Infrared remotes have a maximum range of approximately 30 feet and require the remote control or transmitter and receiver to be within a line of sight.|$|R
50|$|The viaduct {{was built}} as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Haven, Middletown and Willimantic Railroad's line from New Haven to Willimantic, forming {{part of a}} more or less direct route between Boston and New York City. <b>The</b> {{directness}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route required the railroad to cross several deep ravines, including that of Flat Brook, southeast of East Hampton, via high-level bridges; this one would be named after Charles A. Rapallo, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railroad's directors. When Edward W. Serrell, then <b>the</b> Chief Engineer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railroad, set out to design the high iron bridge that would span the valley in about 1870, bridges constructed completely from wrought iron were still a very new technology. Despite Serrell's experience and high reputation as a bridge builder, {{he was not able to}} work out precisely what shape the bridge members should take, and their design was subcontracted to the Phoenix Iron Works, which was to build the bridge. While the structure was originally intended to carry a double track, Serrell's apprehensions about <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge <b>led</b> him to reduce it to a single track before completion. Serrell was apparently discharged as Chief Engineer by <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge's completion in 1873, when he wrote to the Connecticut railroad commissioners expressing his apprehension over the design and construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iron bridges on the line, including the Rapallo and Lyman Viaducts.

40|$|<b>The</b> Sea <b>of</b> Okhotsk is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main regions <b>of</b> {{pinniped}} {{distribution in}} the Russian Far East. There are 7 species <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pinnipeds living: 2 species (Steller sea lion and northern fur seal) are represented by the Otariidae family and 5 species (bearded seal, ringed seal, spotted seal, harbor seal and ribbon seal) are members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Phocidae family. In <b>the</b> second part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last century, all species of true seals, except harbor seals, were <b>the</b> objects <b>of</b> harvest, and were caught year round. Consequently, these species were studied as well. However, in 1994 shipbased harvests of ice seals in <b>the</b> Sea <b>of</b> Okhotsk ended, resulting in a reduced level <b>of</b> study. <b>The</b> main species for harvest in <b>the</b> Sea <b>of</b> Okhotsk was ringed seal, annual catches of which reached almost 100, 000 individuals in certain years. <b>The</b> catch quantity <b>of</b> other pinnipeds was also impressive (Table 1). The most intensive harvest began in 1955, when the Far East fishing fleet flotilla was developed. <b>The</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harvest <b>led</b> to a rapid decline in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> seals. For example, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> ringed seals in <b>the</b> Sea <b>of</b> Okhotsk dropped from 1 million to 600, 000 from the mid- 1950 s to the mid- 1960 s.

40|$|RBS (Rosat Bright Source) 0490 is a cataclysmic {{variable}} star (CV) with unusually strong emission lines. <b>The</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emission lines <b>led</b> to {{a suggestion that}} the object is intrinsically faint and correspondingly nearby (∼ 33 pc), which, if true, would strongly affect estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CV space density.

A Bayesian procedure gives a very uncertain distance estimate of d ∼ 300 pc, and the small parallax alone implies d> 133 pc (at two standard deviations). The mean V magnitude is 17. 4, which implies MV = 10. 9 − 5 log(d/ 200 pc), neglecting extinction. At 200 pc, the space velocity would be over 90 km s − 1 {{with respect to the}} LSR.

5000|$|In 1970 <b>The</b> Supreme Court <b>of</b> Canada was {{concerned}} with exclusionary discretion within the judicial system. In R. v.

Exclusion <b>of</b> evidence on <b>the</b> ground that, although its probative value was unquestionable, it was obtained by methods which the judge considers to be unfair, {{has nothing to do with}} his duty to secure a fair trial for the accused." [...] The sole discretion to exclude evidence is based on <b>the</b> weighing <b>of</b> prejudicial value and probative value. Where the material evidence is being considered for exclusion: [...] "...a judge must determine <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence based on reliability and <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inference it <b>led</b> to, against <b>the</b> cost presented by such evidence, including things as diverse as <b>the</b> practicalities <b>of</b> its presentation, <b>the</b> fairness to the parties and to witnesses, and the potentially distorting effect the evidence can have on <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case."
