40|$|Much {{attention}} {{has been devoted to}} understanding the evolution of elaborate male ornaments and how they may signal male quality. However, the evolution of multicomponent sexual signals remains poorly understood, and past research on this type of signaling has been largely theoretical. <b>Satin</b> <b>bowerbirds,</b> Ptilonorhynchus violaceus, are polygynous, are sexually dichromatic, and construct sexually selected display structures (bowers) : a model system for investigating the evolution and signal function of multiple sexual signals. We studied the interrelationship between bower features, plumage coloration, and indicators of male quality in this species. To do this, we located the bowers of male <b>satin</b> <b>bowerbirds</b> in rainforest in Queensland, Australia, and quantified bower quality. We captured the male bower owners and used reflectance spectrometry to objectively measure the plumage coloration of several body regions. We measured various indicators of male health and condition, including the intensity of infection from ectoparasites and blood parasites. Bower quality and male ultraviolet plumage coloration were significantly correlated. By using multiple regression analyses, we show that bower quality predicts ectoparasite load and body size, whereas ultraviolet plumage coloration predicts the intensity of infection from blood parasites, feather growth rate, and body size. Our findings support the multiple messages hypothesis of multicomponent signals: Female <b>satin</b> <b>bowerbirds</b> should assess both male and bower features to choose the highest quality mates.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{focussed}} {{on the relationship}} between female choice and the multiple exaggerated sexual traits of males. However, {{little is known about the}} ability of males to actively enhance specific components of their display in response to the loss of one component. We investigated the capacity of male <b>satin</b> <b>bowerbirds</b> (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus) to respond to the loss of one of their sexual signals by performing an experiment in which we removed decorations at their bowers. We found that males compensated for decoration loss by increasing bower construction behaviour and decreasing their latency to bower painting. These results are novel because they suggest that males can assess the quality of their own display and make decisions about how to augment their displays. We discuss these results in the context of previous studies of mate choice in <b>satin</b> <b>bowerbirds,</b> as both of the supplementary behaviours we observed are known correlates of male mating success...|$|R
40|$|The mating {{success of}} male <b>Satin</b> <b>Bowerbirds</b> Ptilonorhynchus violaceus {{is known to}} {{correlate}} with the numbers of decoration objects present at their bowers.

We found (a) rates of visiting bowers by adult females and immature individuals were correlated with the number of marked objects at those bowers within but not between areas, (b) the rate of stealing objects was higher in the area at which the average number of objects at bowers was lowest and (c) bower destruction increased relative to stealing in the area where the average number of objects was highest.

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether {{variation in}} structural plumage coloration in <b>satin</b> <b>bowerbirds,</b> Ptilonorhynchus violaceus, could reveal {{the intensity of}} infection from parasites, as predicted from models of parasite-mediated sexual selection (PMSS). To do this, we captured adult male, female, and juvenile male <b>satin</b> <b>bowerbirds</b> in Queensland, Australia, and objectively measured individual plumage reflectance from four body regions using a spectrometer. We quantified both ectoparasite load {{and the intensity of}} infection from blood parasites. In iridescent blue adult males, plumage reflectance is unimodal, with a single peak in the ultraviolet, while in greenish females and juveniles, plumage reflectance is bimodal, with peaks in both the ultraviolet and green portions of the spectrum. In adult males, the intensity of infection from blood parasites was best predicted by plumage brightness (total reflectance), with brighter males having fewer parasites. Similarly, juvenile males exhibiting greater UV chroma (proportion of reflectance in the UV) had fewer blood parasites. Our findings support a key prediction of PMSS models and provide the first evidence that a structural colour ornament can signal the intensity of infection from blood parasites...|$|R

40|$|Males in many {{bird species}} mimic the vocalizations {{of other species}} during sexual displays, but the {{evolutionary}} and functional significance of interspecific vocal mimicry is unclear.

40|$|Models {{of sexual}} {{selection}} suggest that females benefit from assessing male display traits {{to choose their}} mates, but {{little is known about}} how individual females use particular male traits in mate choice. Here I show age-specific use of male display traits by female <b>satin</b> <b>bowerbirds.</b> Male <b>satin</b> <b>bowerbirds</b> build specialized stick structures - bowers - for courtship and copulation, and decorate their bowers with objects collected from the environment. When a female arrives at a bower for courtship, males produce intense behavioral displays that can threaten females. Using a decoration augmentation experiment, I find that young females emphasize blue decorations in mate choice decisions, while old females emphasize male display intensity. These variable preferences support a novel hypothesis for the evolution of multiple male display traits. I find that age-specific preferences reflect age-related differences in female tolerance for intense male displays: young females do not tolerate high-intensity displays and are frequently startled during courtship, while old females actively solicit high-intensity displays, and are rarely startled by these displays. I find that the presence of blue decorations calms females, especially young females, though the reason for the calming effect remains unclear. I find age-related improvement in females' abilities to discriminate among males in mate choice resulting in young females choosing males with higher parasite loads than those males chosen by old females. Finally, I find that juvenile males assess the quality of adult male tutors' displays when deciding which adult males to visit for male-male courtship - the behavioral context in which young males learn their displays. This finding supports a novel hypothesis for display trait learning, and shows that juvenile males have evolved preferences used in tutor choice that parallel female mate choice preferences. Overall, my work shows that (i) multiple male display traits may evolve via variable female preferences, (ii) variable female preferences may reflect interactions between female psychology and the male display traits available for assessment, and (iii) preferences for exaggerated male display traits may be shared by both sexes, but expressed in sex-specific roles...|$|R
