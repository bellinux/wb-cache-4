5|$|Coulter's plan {{to attack}} on August 28 {{had to be}} postponed. Major General Kim Hong Il, the ROK I Corps commander, {{told him he could}} not attack, that there were too many {{casualties}} and the South Korean were exhausted. The NK 5th Division above P'ohang-dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back. On the 28th, the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division, at a time he deemed favorable, advised South Korean Brigadier General Kim Suk Won, the division commander, to counterattack, but Kim refused to do so. The next day Kim <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> move his command post out of P'ohang-dong. The KMAG adviser replied that the KMAG group was going to stay in P'ohang-dong. Upon hearing that, Kim became hysterical but decided to stay for the time being to avoid loss of face. That day, August 28, Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK Army, and meant also for the South Korean Minister of Defense, Shin Sung-mo. He called on the ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter, and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible, counterattacking as necessary to prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their gains.|$|E

25|$|On October 10, 2001, boxing trainer Eddie Futch {{died at age}} 90. Tim Smith of the New York Daily News remembered an {{encounter}} with the trainer in an article. One of the last times I saw Futch was before the Floyd Mayweather Jr.–Diego Corrales junior lightweight title bout in Vegas. Futch {{was talking about how}} much he admired Mayweather's style, how Mayweather was such a beautiful boxer, able to slip along the ropes and avoid punches. Corrales <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> neutralize Mayweather's hand speed by hitting Mayweather on the arms. 'I guess he thinks he's going to stand there and let him hit him on the arms all night,' said Futch, who correctly predicted that Mayweather would completely dismantle Corrales in a defensive masterpiece. Futch had a way of cutting to the heart of a matter. I don't know anyone in boxing who won't miss him. I don't know anyone in boxing that can take his place.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, late {{at night}} on Tuesday, May 7, a 45-year-old black man named Herbert Thomas was flagged down by a {{hitchhiker}} in Kilgore. The man said that he needed a ride to Henderson because his mother was seriously ill and offered $5. Thomas {{said that he would}} not have given the man a ride but felt like he needed to because the man told such a sad story. When they neared Henderson, the man pulled out a pistol and told Thomas to keep driving or he would kill him like the five people he killed in Texarkana, mentioning Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker by name. The man told Thomas that he was not done killing and was planning on killing more. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> return to Texarkana and kill Martin's father. The suspect apparently did not know that Martin's father was already dead. The man then made Thomas stop in Lufkin and told him to drive back to Kilgore and that if he followed him, he would trail him and kill him. The man stole back the $5 as well as an additional $3. Thomas drove back to Kilgore and reported the incident to the police. Thomas described the man as being 5'8, about 130pounds, approximately 27 or 28 years old, with red hair and wore khaki trousers and a GI jacket.|$|E

500|$|Jury {{selection}} {{began on}} February 4. Defense attorneys questioned the first potential jury group of 38 people. They chose two jurors {{on the first}} day of the selection hearing for Cisneros' and Garza's trial. Martínez was no longer part of the proceedings since she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to murder on February 1, and agreed to testify for the prosecution against Cisneros and Garza. According to state law, a defendant cannot be sentenced based on the statement of an alleged accomplice. While interviewing the rest of the potential jurors, each defense attorney struck two potential jurors as did the state. Two others were disqualified, but this did not affect the total number of strikes allowed. Each defendant was allowed eight strikes, and the prosecution sixteen for the two defendants. On February 7, two more jurors were selected, bringing the total to four of the twelve jurors required, plus two alternate jurors. The judge <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> analyze whether he should drop Martínez' capital murder charge since she had pleaded guilty to conspiracy the [...] week before. On February 11, the defense attorneys were half way through the jury selection after selecting a total of seven. On February 16, nine jurors had been selected, but the total number of strikes was reduced after 25 jurors were struck because they had pre-conceived opinions of the defendants. The defense had used 10 strikes between them and had only six left. The prosecution, on the other hand, had eight strikes left. By February 23, eleven jurors had been selected. Only two open spots were available for jurors, one being an alternate.|$|E
