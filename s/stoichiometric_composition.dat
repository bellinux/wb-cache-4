50|$|Hydrocarbon {{polymers}} shrink during pyrolysis, {{and upon}} outgassing form carbon with an amorphous, glass-like structure, which by additional heat treatment {{can be changed}} to a more graphite-like structure. Other special polymers, where some carbon atoms are replaced by silicon atoms, the so-called polycarbosilanes, yield amorphous silicon carbide of more or less <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>composition.</b> A large variety of such SiC-, SiNC-, or SiBNC-producing precursors already exist and more are being developed. To manufacture a CMC material, the fibre preform is infiltrated with the chosen polymer. Subsequent curing and pyrolysis yield a highly porous matrix, which is undesirable for most applications. Further cycles of polymer infiltration and pyrolysis are performed until the final and desired quality is achieved. Usually five to eight cycles are necessary.The process is called liquid polymer infiltration (LPI), or polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP). Here also a porosity of about 15% is common due to the shrinking of the polymer. The porosity is reduced after every cycle.|$|E
50|$|Electron {{microscopy}} studies {{demonstrated that}} thermal antiphase boundaries (APBs) form during cooling through the ordering temperatures, as ordered domains nucleate at different centers within the crystal lattice {{and are often}} {{out of step with}} each other where they meet. The anti-phase domains grow as the alloy is annealed. There are two types of APBs corresponding to the B2 and L21 types of ordering. APBs also form between dislocations if the alloy is deformed. At the APB the manganese atoms will be closer than in the bulk of the alloy and, for non-stoichiometric alloys with an excess of copper (e.g. Cu2.2MnAl0.8), an antiferromagnetic layer forms on every thermal APB. These antiferromagnetic layers completely supersede the normal magnetic domain structure and stay with the APBs if they are grown by annealing the alloy. This significantly modifies the magnetic properties of the non-stoichiometric alloy relative to the stoichiometric alloy which has a normal domain structure. Presumably this phenomenon is related to the fact that pure manganese is an antiferromagnet although it is not clear why the effect is not observed in the stoichiometric alloy. Similar effects occur at APBs in the ferromagnetic alloy MnAl at its <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>composition.</b>|$|E

40|$|The present investigation, {{which forms}} {{part of a}} general {{programme}} of research into the effects of departures from the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>composition</b> on the physical and mechanical properties of ceramic compounds, is concerned with the defect structure of non-stoichiometric rutile. The physical properties of rutile, with particular reference to the effects of departure from the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>composition,</b> have been briefly reviewed. The development and design of an apparatus, incorporating a sensitive microbalance, capable of measuring departures from the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>composition</b> in rutile at low pressures of oxygen and at temperatures up to a maximum of 1300 ^oC is described in detail. The defect structure of non-stoichiometric rutile has been shown to alter as departure from the ideal composition increases. It is concluded that at small departures from the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>composition</b> free anion vacancies are present, whereas at large departures the vacancies cluster on planes of the 100, 101 and 110 types, which subsequently collapse by displacement of ½ forming interstitial cations. The departures from <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>composition</b> which have been observed in high-purity rutile are very small - much smaller than those previously reported in the literature. Larger departures found to occur in impure rutile can be attributed directly to electronic effects associated with impurity atoms.
