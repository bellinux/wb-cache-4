Application of such device in  electric drives of crane travel mechanisms where {{there is no need to}} carry out a technological speed regulation, allows to make soft starting, soft braking and accurate <b>stoppage</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electric drive at the cost of  squirrel-cage induction motor transition to retarded speed prior to stoppage which is ensured by quasi-frequency motor control. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Fans are {{probably}} the simplest types of rotating machinery. In many industries the <b>stoppage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fan used for creating a forced draft would cause a complete plant shutdown. This paper uses root cause analysis for finding out {{the reason for the}} failure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forced draft fan based on a study conducted in a petrochemical industry. This force drought fan is used for supplying air from atmosphere to the boiler. The boilers is used for producing the steam required for the entire plant and also for generating most of the Power required for the plant to run. <b>As</b> failure <b>of</b> the boiler is critical problem, it was found out that vibration was the cause for it and vibration in turn caused bearing failure. In order to reduce vibration levels within the fan setup, some improvements are suggested...|$|R

6000|$|In much of {{his work}} Needham was {{associated}} with Buffon, {{and the results of}} their experiments fitted in admirably with the great French naturalist's hypothesis of [...] "organic molecules," [...] according to which, life is the indefeasible property of certain indestructible molecules of matter, which exist in all living things, and have inherent activities by which they are distinguished from not living matter. Each individual living organism is formed by their temporary combination. They stand to it in the relation of the particles <b>of</b> water to <b>a</b> cascade, or a whirlpool; or to a mould, into which the water is poured. The form of the organism is thus determined by the reaction between external conditions and the inherent activities of the organic molecules of which it is composed; and, as the <b>stoppage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> whirlpool destroys nothing but a form, and leaves the molecules of the water, with all their inherent activities intact, so what we call the death and putrefaction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> animal, or <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plant, is merely the breaking up of the form, or manner of association, of its constituent organic molecules, which are then set free as infusorial animalcules.|$|R
40|$|The {{controllability}} {{problem for}} nonlinear control systems with one-dimensional {{control of the}} form dx/dt=a(x) +B(x) β(x,u) is considered, where a(x) is an n-dimensional vector function, B(x) is an (n× m) -matrix, and β(x,u) is an m-dimensional vector function. Under certain conditions we reduce such system to <b>a</b> system consisting <b>of</b> m subsystems; in each subsystem all equations are linear except of the last one. We use the controllability function method to give sufficient conditions for controllability of the considered system. We propose an approach for construction of controls which transfer an arbitrary initial point to the rest point in a certain finite time. Each such control is constructed as <b>a</b> concatenation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finite number <b>of</b> positional controls (we call it a stepwise synthesis control). On each step of our approach we choose a new synthesis control. Our approach essentially uses nonlinearity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> system {{with respect to a}} control.
