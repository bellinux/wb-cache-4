40|$|Better {{feedback}} {{principles for}} the utility bills in South Africa {{need to be}} developed. Utility providers {{might be able to}} "nudge" consumers towards more desirable consumption patterns by delivering simpler and better feedback informed by applied behavioural sciences. Two sets of controlled experiments were conducted with over 1, 500 subjects to identify bill design strategies that could overcome two major barriers to effective consumption feedback: • the complexity of the utility bill, especially with regards to tariff calculations, and • consumer's declining mindfulness of utility consumption between billing moments. The "Utility Bill Redesign" experiment, using a randomised control trial, investigates how improving billing feedback design increases consumer's understanding of energy usage and costs. More than 1, 300 participants are randomly assigned to different treatment groups and receive one of nine redesigned utility bills or the current standard bill. Thereafter, participant's understanding of the bill they received is tested through a questionnaire. We find that restructuring the bill in a logical order and displaying the amount of electricity consumed in each tariff block with separate bar graphs is a successful way to increase consumer understanding of the bill, especially with regards to the <b>step</b> <b>tariff.</b> Further, the results clearly show that consumers are unable to make sense of a utility bill that is not in their home language, even when adding utility specific symbols. We conclude that significant low-cost improvements can be made to utility bills to increase consumer comprehension. In the "Attention Redirection" experiment, participants are assigned to different treatment groups and are given an online task that requires daily attention and effort in order to maximise pay-offs. We find that daily SMS reminders significantly redirect attention to the daily task. A blank graph, given to participants {{at the beginning of the}} experiment to assist them in self-managing their behaviour, has no effect on task adherence. The results illustrate how inattention routinely leads to sub-optimal behaviour in a specific task area and the resulting welfare loss. A purely bill-based strategy is rendered unsuccessful...|$|E
50|$|The {{reform process}} was {{initiated}} in 2000 {{shortly after the}} first management contract covering the capital Yerevan was signed. As a first <b>step,</b> water <b>tariffs</b> were increased. Then the utility in charge of Yerevan, and which was assisted by the private company under the management contract, was transformed from a government department subject to civil service rules to a publicly owned commercially oriented joint stock company. In 2002 a new Water Code was passed {{as the centerpiece of}} the reform process. A powerful State Committee for Water Economy (SCWE) was created as the main decision-making body for sector policies, except for tariff reviews. The next year an autonomous regulatory agency, the Public Services Regulatory Commission, was set up to review requests for tariff adjustments on the basis of objective criteria. These reforms were an important element in securing the benefits achieved in the sector. The first two years of the management contract in Yerevan prior to the reforms had been challenging, characterized by suspicion and even hostility {{between the government and the}} private company. After the reforms were implemented, the situation improved.|$|R
40|$|Governments in Northeast Asia have {{undertaken}} numerous unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral <b>steps</b> to reduce <b>tariffs</b> and quotas in manufacturing and service sectors. These same governments have, however, been extremely reluctant to dismantle regulatory restrictions segmenting national markets {{and raising the}} cost of air cargo and air passenger transport. This paper evaluates reasons why liberalization and integration of aviation markets in Northeast Asia have proceeded so slowly and gauges prospects for future reform. It argues that a Northeast Asia Transportation Area (NATA) {{be incorporated into the}} proposed South Korea-Japan and South Korea-Japan-China free trade areas. Regional negotiations over liberalization and integration of national aviation markets should, however, be coupled with multilateral talks within the World Trade Organization framework. ...|$|R
40|$|BC Hydro is an {{electric}} utility with a service area covering over 95 % {{of the province}} of British Columbia in Canada. Power Smart is BC Hydro?s demand-side-management (DSM) division. Power Smart develops, operates and manages various DSM programs for residential, commercial and industrial customers. The Power Smart Partners Program (PSP) is the premier demand-side management program for BC Hydro?s large commercial and industrial non-transmission class customers. It is a direct energy acquisition program {{that is based on}} a partnering approach with BC Hydro?s business customers. A customer that commits to being a Power Smart Partner gains access to financial support and assistance with the identification and implementation of electricity savings projects. A direct financial incentive is provided to lower customers? funding requirements and to improve the payback and/or investment criteria for energy efficiency projects. Projects are evaluated against established criteria set forth by BC Hydro. Projects which prove to be the most cost-effective on a $/kWh basis receive funds. For transmission-voltage customers, BC Hydro has recently implemented a new tariff designed to encourage energy reduction. The new tariff is an inclining block tariff and is known as the Stepped Rate. The customer?s consumption is compared against their Customer Baseline Load (CBL). The first 90 % of the customer?s consumption is billed at a Tier 1 rate. The remaining consumption is billed at a Tier 2 rate, approximately two times the Tier 1 rate. There are mechanisms in place to adjust the customer?s CBL to account for activities such as customer-funded demand-side-management projects and customer plant expansion projects. This paper will discuss BC Hydro?s M&V program in terms of the process, operations and M&V results to date for the PSP. In addition, the paper will discuss the new <b>Stepped</b> Rate <b>tariff</b> intricacies in terms of CBL setting, CBL adjustments and transmission customer Impact Study guideline requirements...|$|R
