40|$|Most mammals have dichromatic {{colour vision}} {{based on two}} {{different}} types of cones: a short-wavelength-sensitive cone and a long-wavelength-sensitive cone. Comparing the signal from two cone types gives rise to a one-dimensional chromatic space when brightness is excluded. The so-called ‘neutral point’ refers to the wavelength that the animal cannot distinguish from achromatic light such as white or grey because it stimulates both cone types equally. The question is: how do dichromats perceive their chromatic space? Do they experience a continuous <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>colours</b> or does the neutral point divide their chromatic space into two colour categories, i. e. into colours of either short or long wavelengths? We trained horses to different colour combinations in a two-choice behavioural experiment and tested their responses to the training and test colours. The horses chose colours according to their similarity/relationship to rewarded and unrewarded training colours. There was no evidence for a categorical boundary at the neutral point or elsewhere. This study suggests that dichromats perceive their chromatic space as a continuous <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>colours,</b> treating the colour at the neutral point as any other colour they can distinguish...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project has two goals. One {{is to understand}} the third dimension <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> describing the extent of chromatic contents such as saturation, vividness, chromaticness and colourfulness, which are less widely used than the other dimensions, e. g. lightness and hue. With that in mind, the first aim of this work is to derive new models that may serve {{as an alternative to}} the third-dimension <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> appearance on the basis of colorimetric values. The second goal is to develop important scales, blackness and whiteness. They are widely used because of the popularity of the NCS system. To achieve the first goal, a psychophysical experiment for scaling 15 attributes (Korean corresponding words of “bright”, “light-heavy”, “active-passive”, “fresh-stale”, “clean-dirty”, “clear”, “boring”, “natural-not natural”, “warm-cool”, “intense-weak”, “saturated”, “vivid-dull”, “distinct-indistinct”, “full-thin” and “striking”) using the NCS colour samples was carried out with Korean observers. Each sample was presented in a viewing cabinet in a darkened room. Naive observers were asked to scale each sample using a categorical judgement method. From the results, two scales widely used to represent the third dimension were identified: saturation and vividness. The same samples were assessed by British observers using these two scales. There was a great similarity between the results of the British and Korean observers. Subsequently, more samples were included to scale not only the new third dimension scales (saturation and vividness) but also whiteness and blackness scales. In total, 120 samples were scaled for saturation, vividness and whiteness experiments, and 110 samples were scaled for a blackness experiment. Four sets of models were developed for each <b>of</b> the three <b>colour</b> spaces (CIELAB, CIECAM 02 and CAM 02 -UCS). Type one was based on the ellipsoid equation. Type two was based on the hue-dependent model proposed by Adams (called “the hue-based model”). Each of the above two types was used to fit the present experimental (Cho) data and the NCS data, which were measured using a spectrophotometer. In total, 39 models were developed. The newly developed models were tested using the Cho and NCS datasets. The models that were based on the present visual data were tested using the NCS data. Similarly, the models developed from the NCS data were tested using the present visual data. The results showed that both types of models predicted visual data well. This means that the two sets of data showed good agreement. It is also proposed that the four scales (saturation, vividness, blackness and whiteness) based on CIECAM 02 developed here are highly reliable...|$|R
