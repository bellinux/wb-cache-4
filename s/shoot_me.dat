25|$|From {{the outset}} TV3 {{relied heavily on}} {{importing}} programming from other countries. Prior to the channel's launch TV3 signed agreements with big US broadcasters to air first rights of Sex and the City, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, JAG, , The Net, South Park and Just <b>Shoot</b> <b>Me!.</b> TV3 has also relied on imports from the UK and Australia. In its early days the channel aired two popular UK dramas, Family Affairs (broadcast 18 months after Channel 5) and EastEnders (broadcast with advertising simultaneously with BBC One), and also the short-lived Australian soap Breakers and the US soap Sunset Beach.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 2000s, NBC's {{fortunes}} started to take a rapid turn for the worse. That year, NBC's longstanding ratings lead ended as CBS (which had languished in the ratings after losing the NFL) overtook it for first place. In 2001, CBS chose to move its hit reality series Survivor to serve as the anchor of its Thursday night lineup. Its success was taken as a suggestion that NBC's nearly two decades of dominance on Thursday nights could be broken; even so, the strength of Friends, Will & Grace, ER and Just <b>Shoot</b> <b>Me!</b> (the latter of which saw its highest viewership following its move to that night in the 2000–01 season) helped the network continue to lead the Thursday ratings. Overall, NBC retook its first place lead that year, and spent much of the next four years (with the exception of the 2002–03 season, when it was briefly jumped again by CBS for first) in the top spot.|$|E

25|$|From {{the early}} 1970s, Forbes divided his {{energies}} between cinema, television, theatre and writing. In 1972, Forbes started {{work on the}} documentary, Elton John and Bernie Taupin Say Goodbye Norma Jean and Other Things (1973), which chronicled {{the life of the}} young Elton John and Bernie Taupin. The project took Forbes a full year to complete, and provided a behind-the-scenes look at the writing and recording of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, including interviews with John, Taupin and band members, including Nigel Olsson and Dee Murray, as well as John's mother, Sheila, DJM label head Dick James and son Stephen, and footage of John's Hollywood Bowl concert in 1973. (Some of the footage was licensed for the Eagle Vision Classic Albums series Goodbye Yellow Brick Road documentary.) During the filming, Forbes formed a close friendship with John and Taupin, which led him to do other work with them, including photography on the Don't <b>Shoot</b> <b>Me</b> I'm Only the Piano Player and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album sleeves. ITV transmitted the documentary in the UK on 4 December 1973 (in the US, ABC screened it) shortly after completion, and was later briefly issued on VHS.|$|E

500|$|In {{her first}} appearance, Laura San Giacomo plays Harmony Chase, {{a woman who}} hires Keith to {{investigate}} her cheating husband. The two were both series regulars on the NBC sitcom Just <b>Shoot</b> <b>Me!.</b> The two actors had maintained a close friendship after their sitcom was cancelled, and when Rob Thomas brought up a romantic storyline for Keith to Colantoni, he suggested Giacomo for the role. Giacomo accepted the role, later stating, [...] "It {{was kind of a}} no-brainer situation for me. I love Rico, love working with him, and it was just as much fun as I thought it would be." [...] In addition to sharing in-jokes about Just <b>Shoot</b> <b>Me!</b> while on set, Colantoni also remembered what a good actress he thought she was in their earlier days. After the first appearance, both Colantoni and Giacomo lobbied for more storylines together. Thomas was open to the possibility, saying, [...] "I wouldn't hesitate to go back to this, because I was really happy with how it played out." [...] Giacomo would go on to appear on three episodes of the show.|$|E
500|$|... "Charlie Don't Surf" [...] {{featured}} several notable guest stars, including Matt Czuchry, Ryan Eggold, and San Giacomo, {{who plays}} Harmony Chase, a romantic interest for Keith. Actor Enrico Colantoni, who plays Keith, wanted San Giacomo {{to play the}} role of Harmony because of the actors' ongoing friendship since their show Just <b>Shoot</b> <b>Me!</b> Both actors enjoyed the guest appearance so much that they lobbied the show's production team to continue the characters' romantic storyline in the future. The episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics.|$|E

He saw [...] "10 heavily armed men" [...] approaching, later identified as police agents, when the three passengers exited the car, and the taxi driver was ordered at gunpoint to exit the vehicle.

500|$|At {{the motel}} room, Selena and Saldívar began arguing. Motel guests complained about loud noises coming from Saldívar's room. They said they heard two women arguing about {{business}} matters. Selena told Saldívar {{she could no}} longer be trusted, and demanded Saldívar return her financial papers. Selena then dumped Saldívar's satchel containing bank statements onto the bed and saw the gun. At 11:48a.m. (CST), Saldívar pointed it at Selena. As Selena tried to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the lower right shoulder, severing an artery and causing a massive loss of blood. Trinidad Espinoza, the hotel's maintenance man, reported hearing a [...] "loud bang", which he likened to a car engine misfiring. Selena was critically wounded; she ran towards the lobby, leaving a trail of blood [...] long. She was seen clutching her chest screaming, [...] "Help me! Help me! I've been shot!"; Saldívar was still chasing after her, pointing the gun at her, and calling her a [...] "bitch". According to Carlos Morales, who was waiting outside the motel, he heard screaming and saw Selena running towards him. She grabbed Morales and screamed, [...] "they'll <b>shoot</b> <b>me</b> again". Selena collapsed on the floor at 11:49a.m. (CST) as hotel general manager Barbara Schultz telephoned the emergency services. The singer identified Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Shawna Vela and hotel sales manager Ruben DeLeon tried to stop the flow of blood. Selena's condition began to deteriorate rapidly as motel staff attended to her. Selena screamed at the staff, telling them, [...] "lock the door, she'll <b>shoot</b> <b>me</b> again". DeLeon tried to talk to Selena but noticed she was beginning to lose consciousness; he said she was moaning and moving less often. DeLeon noticed Selena's eyes had rolled back and that she went limp.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{decision}} to expand its programming to Thursday and Friday nights, UPN picked up six original series. Mercy Point {{was one of two}} science fiction television shows picked up by UPN – [...] the second being the time travel-themed Seven Days. Scott D. Pierce of Deseret News described the network's choice of two science-fiction dramas and two 19th century programs (The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer and Legacy) as showing [...] "a definite bent toward the unusual". Prior to its premiere, the show was promoted through its inclusion of Joe Morton in a starring role. Although Callaway envisioned Mercy Point as a companion to Star Trek: Voyager, UPN paired the Star Trek installment with Seven Days instead. Mercy Point was initially broadcast on Tuesday nights at 9pmEST, following the sitcoms Moesha and Clueless. The Moesha and Clueless block was held over from the previous year. Entertainment Weeklys Dan Snierson noted that Mercy Point faced tough competition from other shows in the same time slot, primarily Just <b>Shoot</b> <b>Me!,</b> Spin City, and Felicity. The series carried a TV-PGparental rating, meaning that it was judged as [...] "unsuitable for young children".|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the movie Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken. The movie The Bloodening is a parody of the 1960 film Village of the Damned. The sequence showing the children taking the equipment to build their radio transmitter is a recreation of a sequence from the short comedy films Our Gang, featuring similar music and a dog, with Milhouse dressed like Our Gang character Alfalfa. The review Marge reads of Talk to the Hand [...] "The writing snaps, crackles and pops" [...] was how Variety reviewed the sitcom Just <b>Shoot</b> <b>Me!</b> when it first aired in 1997.

500|$|In 1876 {{hostilities}} {{broke out}} with the Bapedi people under Sekhukhune. Burgers had told the Acting President Piet Joubert not {{to fight a war}} in his absence, so the Transvaal government did little to combat the Bapedi raids. On his return Burgers resolved to send a commando against Sekhukhune; he called on Kruger to lead the column, but much to his surprise the erstwhile Commandant-General refused. Burgers unsuccessfully asked Joubert to head the commando, then approached Kruger twice more, but to no avail. Kruger was convinced that God would cause any military expedition organised by Burgers to fail—particularly if the President rode with the commando, which he was determined to do. [...] "I cannot lead the commando if you come", Kruger said, [...] "for, with your merry evenings in laager and your Sunday dances, the enemy will even <b>shoot</b> <b>me</b> behind the wall; for God's blessing will not rest on your expedition." [...] Burgers, who had no military experience, led the commando himself after several other prospective generals rebuffed him. After being routed by Sekhukhune, he hired a group of [...] "volunteers" [...] under the German Conrad von Schlickmann to defend the country, paying for this by levying a special tax. The war ended, but Burgers became extremely unpopular among his electorate.|$|E
