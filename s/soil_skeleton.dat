25|$|A {{state of}} 'soil liquefaction' {{occurs when the}} {{effective}} stress of soil is reduced to essentially zero, which corresponds to a complete loss of shear strength. This may be initiated by either monotonic loading (e.g. single sudden occurrence {{of a change in}} stress – examples include an increase in load on an embankment or sudden loss of toe support) or cyclic loading (e.g. repeated change in stress condition – examples include wave loading or earthquake shaking). In both cases a soil in a saturated loose state, and one which may generate significant pore water pressure on a change in load are the most likely to liquefy. This is because a loose soil has the tendency to compress when sheared, generating large excess porewater pressure as load is transferred from the <b>soil</b> <b>skeleton</b> to adjacent pore water during undrained loading. As pore water pressure rises a progressive loss of strength of the soil occurs as effective stress is reduced.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt is {{considered}} {{that the long}} term settlement of clay deposits, known as secondary consolidation, is caused by clay viscosity. In this paper, the viscous property of clayey soils is examined from two viewpoints: one is temperature {{and the other is}} the effect of the strain rate. To investigate these effects, a special constant rate of strain (CRS) loading test, in which the strain rate is changed during the test, was carried out at temperatures of 10 and 50 °C on reconstituted clay samples. Under the normal strain rate, such as the order of 10 − 6 s− 1, well-known temperature effects on the consolidation behavior were confirmed. That is, the high temperature condition leads to increased hydraulic conductivity due to the reduction in the viscosity of pore water at higher temperatures. It is also observed that the yield consolidation stress decreases with increasing temperature due to the viscous properties of <b>soil</b> <b>skeletons.</b> However, it is found that with higher temperature and smaller strain rates, the clay specimen does not follow conventional viscous behavior, like the Isotache model, but the gradient of stress–strain curve considerably decreases. The reason for different behavior from the Isotache model may be attributed {{to the creation of a}} new structure to resist the external deformation, under high temperature and a slow strain rate...|$|R

50|$|At {{the height}} of the past {{glaciation}} (about 10,000 years ago), the land was 'pushed' down by the weight of the ice (isostatic depression). All of the ground-up rock was deposited in the surrounding ocean, which had penetrated significantly inland. The loose deposition of the silt and clay particles in the marine environment, allowed an unusual flocculation to take place. Essentially, this formed a strongly bonded <b>soil</b> <b>skeleton,</b> which was 'glued' by highly mobile sea-salt ions.|$|E
50|$|At this point, {{there was}} only the {{formation}} of very strong marine clay, which is found {{all over the world and}} highly stable, but with its own unique geotechnical problems. When the glaciers retreated, the land mass rose (post-glacial rebound), the clay was exposed, and formed the soil mass for new vegetation. The rainwater in these northern countries was quite aggressive to these clays, perhaps because it was softer (containing less calcium), or the higher silt content allowed more rainwater and snowmelt to penetrate. The final result was that the ionic 'glue' of the clay was weakened, to give a weak, loose <b>soil</b> <b>skeleton,</b> enclosing significant amounts of water (high sensitivity with high moisture content).|$|E

30|$|Under normal {{conditions}} in Northern European medieval cemeteries only the bones are preserved; the decayed soft tissue is now normally {{part of the}} <b>soil</b> surrounding the <b>skeleton.</b> However, {{it seems that the}} Hg which was originally present in the soft tissue is now often still in-place and preserved in the soil.

The most likely explanation for Hg still being in-place in a situation where so many other compounds and elements have been dissipated by diagenesis is that Hg with its high affinity of S very soon ended up as HgS, which is very stable indeed in the geochemical environment [4].

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} bonded or cemented soils {{within the framework of}} hardening plasticity. The model is based on the concepts that (1) the strength of a cemented soil can be considered to be made up of two components, the usual strength of the <b>soil</b> <b>skeleton</b> and the strength of cementation bonds; and (2) the deformation of the soil is associated with the component of stresses on the <b>soil</b> <b>skeleton</b> (excluding the bonds), as in a reconstituted soil, whereas the cement bonds offer additional resistance at any given strain level. The overall response of the soil under loading can be visualized as two stiffnesses acting in parallel for the given unit strain. Separate stress-strain relations are defined for the two components and they are then combined to give the overall response. The stress-strain relationship for the <b>soil</b> <b>skeleton</b> component is described here using the modified Cam-clay model. A simple model within the elastoplastic framework is proposed for the "cemented" component. The cemented component incorporates strain softening.

40|$|Energy {{foundations}} (or geothermal foundations) {{are becoming}} more popular as an energy-saving and environmentally-friendly technology. By fully utilizing the steady ground temperature and the thermal properties of concrete, buildings can be heated and cooled through energy foundations with heat pumps at very low cost. Although some observations have been obtained from full-scale field tests and centrifuge-scale tests, there are still issues that are not well understood {{with respect to the}} complex interactions among temperature change, induced effective stress, and pore fluid flow in partially saturated soils. In order to investigate soil-structure interaction between energy foundations and partially saturated soil under non-isothermal condition, the thesis develops a fully coupled thermo-poro-mechanical (TPM) finite element (FE) model with both nonlinear elastic, and temperature- and suction-dependent elasto-plastic solid skeleton constitutive models implemented. Based on the mixture theory of porous media and fundamental laws of continuum mechanics, governing equations are formulated to account for the coupled processes involving the mechanical response, multiphase pore fluid flow, and heat transfer. Constitutive relations consist of the effective stress concept, Fourier 2 ̆ 7 s law, as well as Darcy 2 ̆ 7 s law and Fick 2 ̆ 7 s law for pore liquid and gas flow. The elasto-plastic constitutive model for the <b>soil</b> solid <b>skeleton</b> is based on a critical state soil mechanics framework. The constitutive parameters are mostly fitted with experimental data. The TPM model is formulated under small strain and axisymmetric condition, and implemented within the finite element method (FEM). We then simulate a series of energy foundation centrifuge experiments conducted at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Good agreement is obtained between the experimental observations and modeling results. Another novelty and challenge of the thesis is to develop a double-noded zero-thickness TPM cohesive interface element (CIE) model with elastoplasticity for fractured geomaterials under saturated or partially saturated condition. The advantage of TPM CIE is to take account of various jumps within the fracture with respect to tangential and normal displacements, pore liquid and gas pressure, as well as temperature. Both pre-existing fracture and developing fracture can be analyzed by choosing appropriate constitutive models. With CIE implemented at the soil-foundation interface, we are able to capture the plastic failure process of energy foundations due to the loss of side shear resistance. We can also apply the TPM CIE to better understand the generation of fractures involving coupled processes in other applications involving mudstone/shale, such as hydraulic fracturing, and reservoir storage of CO 2 or nuclear waste...|$|R

It was believed {{that it would not be}} possible to recover any remaining bones from the battle field area, in modern times, as they would have disappeared due to the acidic <b>soil.</b> However, a <b>skeleton</b> that was found in a medieval cemetery, and originally thought to be associated with the 13th-century Battle of Lewes turned out to be contemporary with the Norman invasion. Skeleton 180 had sustained six fatal sword cuts to the back of the skull and was one of five skeletons that had suffered violent trauma. Skeleton 180 was one of 123 remains found in a medieval cemetery belonging to the Hospital of St Nicholas, which was run by monks from Lewes Priory. Many of the excavated skeletons exhibited the tell tale signs of a range of diseases common in that era, including leprosy, but only Skeleton 180 had died from head injuries. The reason why historians had originally thought that skeleton 180 was involved in the battle of Lewes is because the hospital was situated at the epicentre of the conflict. What had puzzled archaeologists though, was that most of the victims of the battle had been buried in mass grave pits dug next to the battle itself; these pits had been discovered by road builders in the 19th century. Analysis now continues on the other remains found, at the site of the hospital, to try and build up a more accurate picture of who the individuals were.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} o f {{this body}} o f {{research was to}} analyse selected archaeological human bones from the Ballyhanna assemblage {{in order to establish}} the paleodiet consumed by the Medieval population of Ballyhanna. However, before it was possible to analyse for elements which were indicative of diet, it was necessary to establish the extent o f preservation/diagenesis experienced by the skeletons in a burial environment. It is essential that the skeletons have undergone very little diagenetic alteration in a burial environment. This is necessary from the point o f view that should the biogenic elemental concentrations experience little or no alteration, only then would it be possible to assign dietary signatures. A number of different analyses were conducted in order to establish the degree of preservation/diagenesis experienced by the selected Ballyhanna articulate (complete or almost complete) <b>skeletons.</b> <b>Soil</b> samples from the Ballyhanna cemetery (both burial and non-burial) were tested for pH levels. The average soil pH for the soil which was in contact with the skeletons was 7. 57 ± 0. 30. The average soil pH for the non-burial soil was 7. 62 ± 0. 19. According to Lindsay (1979) soil with a pH of 6. 5 or greater will result in the preservation of adult skeletons. The Ballyhanna assemblage was very well preserved. The pH determined for both types of soil was indicative of an alkaline pH. This indicates that bone preservation would have occurred as opposed to bone disintegration should the soil pH have been acidic. Before any bone or soil samples were analysed, it was necessary to validate the analytical method implemented in order to establish that the methods used were suitable for the purpose intended. The following parameters were assessed: Specificity, Detection Limits, Quantitation limits, Sensitivity, Linearity, Precision and Accuracy in order to ensure the method used was suitable. Rare earth elemental (REE) analyses was conducted in order to establish the incorporation of exogenous ions during the burial process. Rare earth elements lanthanum, cerium, praeosydium, neodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, dymium, holmium, erbium, terbium, thulium, ytterbium and lutetium were analysed. EUtimately, based on £REE concentrations (8. 332 ± 6. 2 ppm; n= 38) it was confirmed that the femurs from the Ballyhanna cemetery were quite well preserved. Multi-elemental analysis o f the bones was conducted in order to establish whether or not the elemental concentrations in bones were reflective of biogenic concentrations.

For this purpose, total of 36 sampling plots made of 1 m 2 size cages with of {{with the help}} of wire fences were established at 1900, 2000 and 2200 m altitudes. Vegetation samples taken from these cages were first identified and classified into botanical composition and then their fresh and dry forage yield were estimated along with their grazing capacity. In addition, total of 72 undisturbed and disturbed soil samples taken from 0 - 20 cm depth were analyzed for permeability, bulk density, content of fine particles and <b>soil</b> <b>skeleton,</b> root amount, texture, particle density, porosity, organic matter (OM) and soil pH. According to the estimated results, the mean fresh forage yield was determined as 647. 22 kg/da, the mean dry forage yield was estimated to be 196. 67 kg/da. It was determined that the botanical composition was made up of % 46. 16 poaceae (gramineae), % 14. 36 leguminosae (fabaceae) and % 39. 45 other families and showed some significant differences among the elevation gradients. In addition, some properties of soils including OM, bulk density, the contents of fine particles, <b>soil</b> <b>skeleton</b> and porosity displayed significant differences between the altitudes in the pasturelands. Finally, the results of the correlation analyses revealed that some of the soil properties played significantly important roles on shaping the botanical composition of the pasturelands...|$|E
