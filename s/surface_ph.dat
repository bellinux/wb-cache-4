Materials and Methods: The study was carried out in two phases. In Phase I, the <b>surface</b> tension and <b>pH</b> of five vehicles (distilled water, saline, anesthetic solution, chlorhexidine, and glycerin) were evaluated using a Du Nuoy Tensiometer and a pH Meter. In Phase II, a predetermined amount of calcium hydroxide was mixed with the individual vehicles and the <b>surface</b> tension and <b>pH</b> was determined. In each group, seven samples were evaluated. Results: Among the individual vehicles, chlorhexidine had the least surface tension values (39. 8 &#x 002 B; 1. 1 dynes/cm). Among the various calcium hydroxide mixtures, calcium hydroxide with chlorhexidine showed the least surface tension values (36. 4 &#x 002 B; 1. 1 dynes/cm). All the vehicles showed an acidic pH ranging from 5 to 6. 5. There was a significant increase in the pH values with the addition of calcium hydroxide to the respective vehicles. The calcium hydroxide mixtures had an alkaline pH ranging from 9 to 11. 5; the highest pH was observed for calcium hydroxide mixed with distilled water and saline (11. 5 &#x 002 B; 0. 2).

40|$|Abstract. Effect of {{activating}} {{device on}} the property of tap water was studied by <b>surface</b> tensiometer and <b>pH</b> meter. The {{results showed that the}} surface tension of tap water activated by the device reduced and pH value increased. The variations of <b>surface</b> tension and <b>pH</b> value are connected with flow rates. The larger flow rate, the less variation of <b>surface</b> tension and <b>pH</b> value when at the same cycle time, however, the more variation of <b>surface</b> tension and <b>pH</b> value when at the same activating time. Activated by the device, 17 O NMR half width of tap water reduced from 70. 79 Hz at the inlet to 60. 87 Hz at the outlet. Reduction of surface tension were caused by hydrogen bonds in water clusters which were weakened or broken by far-infrared radiation of functional ceramic ball and galvanic cell action of copper-zinc alloy.

5000|$|Ocean <b>surface</b> <b>pH</b> is {{estimated}} to have decreased from about 8.25 to 8.14 {{since the beginning of}} the industrial era, and a further drop of 0.3-0.4 units is expected. This drop has made it so the amount of hydrogen ions have increased by 30%. Before the industrial age the conditions for calcium carbonate production were typically stable in surface waters since the carbonate ion is at supersaturated concentrations. However, as the ionic concentration falls, carbonate becomes under-saturated, making calcium carbonate structures vulnerable to dissolution. Corals experience reduced calcification or enhanced dissolution when exposed to elevated [...] This causes the skeletons of the corals to weaken, or even not be made at all.|$|E
5000|$|This type of {{amendment}} creates {{acidic conditions}} (pH less than 7) in the litter, resulting in {{more of the}} ammoniacal nitrogen being temporarily retained as ammonium rather than ammonia. Ammonium is a highly reactive ion that bonds with sulfates, nitrates and phosphates to form ammonium salts that improve the nutrient value of litter when land applied as fertilizer. The acidity also creates unfavorable environment for urolytic bacteria reducing the production of enzymes that contribute to ammonia formation, resulting in reduced ammonia production. Urolytic bacteria have a pH optimum of approximately 8.3 and litter amendments lower the litter <b>surface</b> <b>pH</b> to below 4.0 {{for a short period}} of time, usually between 3-5 days depending on the litter amendment. There are several different types of acidifiers, such as alum, acidified liquid alum, sodium bisulfate, ferric sulfate, and sulfuric acid, that have been used by the poultry industry. These products vary in effectiveness as the pH is raised by the activity of the poultry within a couple of weeks. The combination of using litter amendments and poultry house ventilation provides a healthy and comfortable rearing environment. Controlling volatilized ammonia in poultry and livestock rearing environments is critical to maintaining a high level of animal health, well-being and efficient live performance. Most of these products are regulated by DOT and HAZMAT and physical properties for the different products rang from mild irritant to corrosive. Most litter acidifiers are corrosive but when applied according to manufacturers instructions are safe and effective. [...] Sodium bisulfate has been considered generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA.|$|E

The surfaces chosen are bare Si/SiO(2) wafers and Si/SiO(2) wafers covered with concanavalin A (ConA), jacalin (Jac), polystyrene (PS), or poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) films. Adsorption experiments at pH 7. 2 and pH 3 onto all surfaces revealed that (i) adsorption of DENV particles took place only onto ConA under pH 7. 2, because of specific recognition between glycans on DENV surface and ConA binding site; (ii) DENV particles did not attach {{to any of the}} <b>surfaces</b> at <b>pH</b> 3, suggesting the presence of positive charges on DENV <b>surface</b> at this <b>pH,</b> which repel the positively charged lectin surfaces; (iii) SHA particles are positively charged at pH 7. 2 and pH 3 because they adhered to negatively charged <b>surfaces</b> at <b>pH</b> 7. 2 and repelled positively charged layers at pH 3; and (iv) SHA particles carry polar groups on the surface because they attached to silanol <b>surfaces</b> at <b>pH</b> 3 and avoided hydrophobic PS films at pH 3 and pH 7. 2. The adsorption behavior of Eprot at pH 7. 2 revealed affinity for ConA > Jac > PSS > PS approximate to bare Si/SiO(2) layers. These findings indicate that selectivity of the Eprot adsorption is higher when it is part of virus structure than when it is free in solution. The correlation between surface energy values determined by means of contact angle measurements and DENV, SHA, or Eprot adsorption behavior was used to understand the intermolecular forces at the interfaces. A direct correlation was not found because the contributions from surface energy were probably surpassed by specific contributions.

During the time taken for the study transmural potential difference only changed by 1 - 2 mV. Serosal <b>surface</b> <b>pH</b> changed with buffer pH, suggesting that the maintained <b>surface</b> <b>pH</b> is a property of the mucosal surface only.

Values for the midgut were approximately 6. 5, yet the distal ileum gave values of 7. 3, which was marginally more alkaline than the buffer. These results agree with the known acidification phenomenon in the jejunum and the alkalinisation process in the ileum. No difference in <b>surface</b> <b>pH</b> was detected when bicarbonate buffer was used, nor when glucose {{was included in the}} buffer.

The aim of our paper is to investigate the carbonate chemistry dynamics of the <b>surface</b> water using <b>pH</b> and ancillary data. The main processes controlling the pH distribution along the ship's transect, and their relative importance, were determined using a statistical approach. The study highlights the impact of biological activity, temperature and riverine inputs on the carbonate chemistry dynamics of the shelf seas surface water. For this summer cruise, the biological activity formed the main control of the pH distribution along the cruise transect. Variations in chlorophyll and nutrients explained 29 % of the pH variance along the full transect and as much as 68 % in the northern part of the transect. In contrast, the temperature distribution explained ca. 50 % of the pH variation in the Skagerrak region. Riverine inputs were evidenced by high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels in the Strait of Moyle (northern Irish Sea) and the southern North Sea with consequent remineralisation processes and a reduction in pH.

Based on the study of surface sediments (multi-cores) retrieved along a depth transect on the Sierra Leone Rise (Eastern Equatorial Atlantic), we document the decrease of B/Ca and Mg/Ca of Globigerinoides sacculifer shells with increasing water depth and dissolution. This effect of dissolution on B/Ca may potentially represent a severe bias for paleo-pH reconstructions using this species. Samples of G. sacculifer were analyzed independently at two laboratories for B/Ca and Mg/Ca.

Observations suggest that this leached layer has a di-calcium phosphate (CaHPO 4) composition and that it controls the apparent solubility of FAP.
