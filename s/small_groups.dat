40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{importance}} of <b>small</b> <b>group</b> activity {{has recently been}} emphasized in the gifted education in science because of the increased needs to foster the human resources that could explore through the communication and collaboration. In this study, we investigated {{the characteristics of the}} verbal interaction according to the learning styles of the gifted-students in science in the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> activity and examined how learning style affected the interaction within a group in order to seek an effective grouping strategy. The competition, cooperative, and dependent students with learning style in the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 1 and the cooperative, cooperative, dependent students in the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 2 were assigned by the 6 science high school stu-dents. The analyses of the results revealed that the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 1 showed the asymmetric interaction of the low level, whereas the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 2 showed the symmetric interaction of the high level. In other words, the frequencies of in-depth interaction in the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 2 were higher than those in the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 1, and also students in the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 2 were equally involve...|$|R

SGB was founded in 1970 by William Fawcett Hill during the heyday of the study of small groups; it was the resource for prac-titioners and researchers from many disciplines who were interested in studying <b>small</b> <b>group</b> processes and behaviors, particularly using observational coding schemes and other techniques that captured in vivo group behaviors. IJSGR was founded by Rick Kettner-Polley; he recognized that some of the best <b>small</b> <b>group</b> research was taking place around the world, and there was no good publication source that brought this work together. The merger of SGB and IJSGR built on the strengths of both; as a result, SGR remains intentionall...|$|R

40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>group</b> {{leadership}} self-efficacy is {{conceptualized as}} an individual?s {{degree of confidence}} in his/her ability to successfully assume {{a leadership role in}} a <b>small</b> <b>group.</b> The task specificity of self-efficacy and the conceptualization of leadership as context bound informs the need for a <b>small</b> <b>group</b> leadership self-efficacy measure that is a superior operationalization of the specified construct than extant measures of leadership self-efficacy in the context of <b>small</b> <b>group</b> leadership. Consequently, {{the purposes of this study}} were: (a) to develop a psychometrically sound self-report measure of <b>small</b> <b>group</b> leadership self-efficacy and establish its underlying structure through factor analytic procedures, and (b) to present preliminary validity evidence for the measure. In order to develop a representative item pool for the posited <b>small</b> <b>group</b> leadership self-efficacy dimensions, relevant theory was reviewed and extant literature was surveyed, with special attention to factor analytic studies. Using the data of 568 undergraduate students collected online, Study 1 investigated the factor structure of the initial 101 -item measure. This resulted in the refinement and reduction of the initial measure to a 32 -item measure, consisting of 5 dimensions. However, in Study 2, factor analyzing data collected from 296 undergraduate students who completed only the 32 items retained in Study 1 and the item-to-category sorts of 7 independent judges resulted in the confirmation of a second-order <b>small</b> <b>group</b> leadership self-efficacy factor structure with 2 dimensions (initiating structure and consideration) consisting of 23 items that best captured the content domain of the construct. The final 23 -item measure of <b>small</b> <b>group</b> leadership self-efficacy was embedded into a nomological network where its relationships with four variables of interest was tested and results revealed that previous <b>small</b> <b>group</b> leadership experience, valence of previous <b>small</b> <b>group</b> leadership experience, and subjective vitality are correlates of <b>small</b> <b>group</b> leadership self-efficacy. The results of the present work have both theoretical and practical implications. An outcome of this study is a psychometrically sound measure of <b>small</b> <b>group</b> leadership self-efficacy which has the potential for high utility in both applied and scientific settings. These implications as well as possible directions for future research are identified and discussed...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE TEACHERS’ USE, OR NON-USE, OF <b>SMALL</b> <b>GROUP</b> DISCUSSION by JULIANNE SNIDER August 2016 Advisor: Dr. Karen Feathers Major: Reading, Language, and Literature Degree: Doctor of Education This {{qualitative}} study explored teacher answers to one question: What factors influence teachers’ decisions to use, or not use, <b>small</b> <b>group</b> discussion. Research supports {{a variety of}} <b>small</b> <b>group</b> discussion approaches to meet a range of curricular goals. Despite the philosophical move to student-centered discussion approaches, and research supporting <b>small</b> <b>group</b> discussion as an effective literacy approach, teacher led whole class discussion continues as the dominant approach. An online teacher survey about teacher use of discussion generated fifteen teachers, grades two through eight, who were interviewed to gather data on their perspectives about student discussion. Three themes emerged from the interview data: (1) Teachers’ perspectives about their philosophy of education differed between teachers who used <b>small</b> <b>group</b> discussion and whole class discussion, (2) Teacher’s talk about students differed between teachers who used <b>small</b> <b>group</b> discussion and whole class discussion, and (3) Teachers’ talk about the teacher’s role or purpose differed between teachers who used <b>small</b> <b>group</b> discussion and whole class discussion. Based on the findings, the implications suggest that teachers who are successful at implementing <b>small</b> <b>group</b> discussion have reading related advanced degrees, they have adopted constructivist philosophies, perhaps through their advanced degrees in reading, and they benefit from administrative and collegial support. Without the reading education and the philosophy to support student-centered approaches, teacher comments revealed that even when school-wide literacy programs, designed to engage students in <b>small</b> <b>group</b> discussion, were implemented, teachers manipulated the program activities to fit their teacher-led style...|$|R
