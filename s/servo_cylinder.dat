30|$|The <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder</b> is the {{executive}} component of a hydraulic servo system. Its performance directly affects overall system control accuracy under both dynamic and static conditions [1 – 3]. When an overloaded horizontal <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder</b> articulates an output curve force, a partial load {{is placed on the}} piston rod based on the installation and load characteristics [1, 4, 5], creating friction between the piston rod and guide sleeve, which can lead to leakage and scuffing of the cylinder bore.

30|$|The {{amplitude}} attenuation and {{the phase}} lag {{can be used}} to evaluate the force control accuracy and response speed respectively, yet the two sensitivity indexes plus-minus characteristics of some parameters are not the same. The two sensitivity indexes plus–minus characteristics of α 1, α 5 and α 14 is opposite, when these three parameters increase, the amplitude attenuation increases and the phase lag decreases. The two performance indexes plus–minus characteristics of α 8 is opposite under some working conditions but the same under the other working conditions. Qualitatively speaking, the effective piston area of <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder</b> increasing enlarges the output force, which improves the system performance based on the force equilibrium equation, but the effective piston area of <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder</b> increasing enlarges the compressible oil volume of the <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which delays the pressure building time and has negative effects on the system performance.

40|$|Hydraulic differential, {{electric}} <b>servo</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{are strongly}} non-linear, coupled multivariable electromechanical tools applicable for driving e. g. manipulators. Besides saturation-type nonlinearities discontinous ones originating from the {{friction between the}} cylinder and the piston and the hydrodynamic properties {{of the flow of}} the working fluid are present in such systems. Though they have considerable advantages in comparison with electric ones in several applications their traditional PID control have to cope with the problem of instabilities and dificulties in finding the proper setting of their feedback gains. These parameters significantly depend on the actual pose of the robot arm and the temperature of the hydraulic oil varying during operation. To widen their applicability both disturbance rejection based, and partial flatness principle based approaches requiring the accurate model of the system and measurement of the disturbances and their time-derivatives were proposed. For getting rid of needing this accurate set of information an adaptive approach working with a hectic learning phase and an acceptable regime of “tuned ” operation was also proposed.

30|$|When an {{output curve}} {{force is applied}} to a {{horizontal}} <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder</b> with a heavy load, the piston rod bears a dynamic partial load based on the installation and load characteristics, which significantly affects the frequency response and control accuracy of the <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Based on this partial load, increased friction can lead to cylinder bore scuffing, leakage, lack of output power, or even system failure. In this paper, a novel asymmetric static-pressure support structure is proposed based on the principle of hydrostatic support. The radial component force of a dynamic partial load is balanced by cooperation between the support oil cushion of the variable hydraulic pressure support structure, oil cushion of the supportive force, and the damper. Adaptive control of the <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder</b> piston rod, guide sleeve, and piston, as well as the cylinder oil film friction between lubricated surfaces is achieved. In this paper, theoretical design and analysis of the traditional hydrostatic bearing structure and novel structure are presented.

However, such designs only solve sealing problems for hydraulic cylinders and cannot solve the partial load problem for servo cylinders.

30|$|Yet {{sensitivity}} analysis {{has a few}} applications in hydraulic system. Vilenus [18] applied trajectory {{sensitivity analysis}} to the valve-controlled cylinder system of the logging machine and the mathematical model of this system was simplified to fifth order model where the servo valve flow-pressure nonlinearity and dead zone nonlinearity were taken into consideration. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of ten main parameters containing viscous damping coefficient, conversion mass, internal leakage coefficient of <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder,</b> effective piston area of <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder,</b> effective bulk modulus, servo valve gain, nature frequency of servo valve, damping ratio of servo valve, conversion coefficient and system supply oil pressure is obtained with parameters change 1 % under single working condition. The sensitivity analysis {{results indicated that the}} sensitivity of piston rod area of the <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder,</b> servo valve gain, conversion flow coefficient and system supply oil pressure is large and that of viscous damping coefficient, internal leakage coefficient of the servo valve, damping ratio of servo vale and nature frequency of the servo valve is relatively small under the same working condition. Furthermore, Farasat et al. [19] founded the fourth order linear mathematical model of the valve-controlled cylinder position control system where the servo valve flow-pressure nonlinearity is linearized partially. The sensitivity of other parameters, such as servo valve torque motor constant, servo valve area constant, orifice opening of metering valve, system return oil pressure, supply oil volume, return oil volume and input signal voltage, is given with parameters change 1 % under single working condition by four sensitivity evaluation methods including VILENUS method, revised VILENUS method, Entirety index method and Individual characteristics method. The analysis results indicated that the sensitivity of effective piston area of <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder,</b> flow coefficient, conversion mass and input signal voltage is relatively small. Kong et al. [20 – 22] first established the fifth linear order mathematical model for the hydraulic drive unit of quadruped robot and derived the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis. Aimed at the imprecise conclusion of sensitivity analysis obtained from the linear model, some nonlinear models are also established. Besides, the sensitivity mathematical expressions with nonlinear and time-varied parameters are derived under the trotting gait working conditions. Kong et al. [23] derived the mathematical model of the second order trajectory sensitivity analysis based on the mathematical model of the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis. Therefore, the situation where the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis accuracy of some parameters is not high is improved. Then the experimental verification is conducted.|$|E

30|$|From Figure  13, one can {{see that}} under the same {{conditions}} as those described above, the conventional hydrostatic symmetrical support structure must provide a much greater force when the horizontal articulated <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder</b> is reciprocating. A maximum of 250 % of a given load force is required in response, which is not achievable for this structure. Furthermore, over the entire movement, the direct force fluctuation in the piston rod and guide sleeve is very large, reaching a maximum value of 232 N, which {{is much higher than}} the maximum value for the asymmetric hydrostatic support structure design proposed in this paper. From Figure  11, {{one can see}} that the response to the maximum eccentric load of 2000 N for the proposed system is less than 10 % of that value. The asymmetric static-pressure support structure proposed in this paper can effectively overcome the issues of wear, leakage, and insufficient output force caused by the weight and external load characteristics of a heavy-duty <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder</b> with a horizontal hinged installation. From Figure  12, one can see that the direct maximum force between the piston rod and guide sleeve is 50 pN for the proposed structure.

40|$|The bi-axial fatigue {{loading of}} wind energy {{converter}} rotor blades at various frequencies was tested at Fraunhofer IWES in November 2010. The loading method used to oscillate the blade {{will be discussed}} in this paper. More wind energy converter rotor blades will be tested for fatigue life in the future due to the ongoing optimization process within an increasing industry. State-of-the-art tests are made by oscillating the blade separately in flap and edge eingenfrequency for 1 to 5 Â· 10 e 6 cycles. With this method, a constant amplitude test is performed in flap and edge direction separately. Because the eigenfrequencies of the blade cannot be changed, the testing time is set to the load cycle number needed for the test divided by the eigenfrequency for each direction. The test time needed might easily exceed five months. One idea of reducing the testing time but keeping or maybe improving the quality of the test, is to move the blade in a bi-axial oscillation in flap and edge direction at the same time, which should reduce the testing time by a factor of two. The bi-axial blade tests performed in November 2010 at the Fraunhofer IWES within the "Better Blade" project showed that a bi-axial loading of a rotor blade in or near both eigenfrequencies can be performed with two <b>servo</b> hydraulic <b>cylinders</b> directly attached to the blade. It was shown that the movement of the blade is well predictable throughout the test and that there is no measurable disturbance, for example due to higher eigenfrequencies. The different options how to move the blade in a bi-axial way are discussed in this paper. How these loadings affect the material of the different blade structures is not a major topic. Future work will contain the calculation of the damage applied to various blade structures by loading the blade with the different bi-axial movements. Then a comparison with the damage calculated by the numerical turbine simulation should be performed...|$|R

The parameters of hydraulic <b>cylinders,</b> <b>servo</b> valves, hydraulic supply power and gravity balance system are designed and optimized in detail. To improve synchronization and tracking control precision, a hybrid control strategy is proposed. The cross-coupled control using a novel based on sliding mode control based on adaptive reaching law (ASMC), which can adaptively tune the parameters of sliding mode control (SMC), is proposed to reduce the synchronization error. To improve the tracking performance, the observer-based inverse control scheme combining the feed-forward inverse model controller and disturbance observer is proposed. The system model is identified applying the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm and then the feed-forward inverse controller is designed based on zero phase error tracking controller (ZPETC) technique. To compensate disturbance and model errors, disturbance observer is used cooperating with the designed inverse controller. The combination of the novel ASMC cross-coupled controller and proposed observer-based inverse controller can improve the control precision noticeably. The dual-shaking table experiment system is built and various experiments are performed.

40|$|Servo {{pneumatic}} and / or hydraulic drives {{are widely}} used in modern engineering and process control. The efficiency of using pneumatic / hydraulic drives depends on their parameters and characteristics. To select the optimal drive parameters, various methods are used, based on finding the minimum of the target (target or criteria) function. The objective {{of this paper was}} to apply one crucial criterion (target function) that provides determination of optimal parameters of the pneumatic / hydraulic drive with the translational motion of the end-effector as well as its use in the synthesis of the <b>servo</b> pneumatic <b>cylinder.</b> The article shows the form of the target function representing a set of drive parameters that do not have direct relationships with each other in a dimensionless form for the pneumatic / hydraulic drive with the translational motion of the end-effector. To calculate the parameters of the servo drive close to the optimal ones, a two-criteria LPτ search was used. As criteria, were used the decisive criterion - the proposed target function, and the power developed by the actuator of the pneumatic / hydraulic drive, which were presented in a dimensionless form. It is shown that the criterion for solution optimality is the minimum distance of the selected point in the space of the normalized criteria from the origin. This point was determined. In addition to the proposed criteria, non-formalised requirements were taken into account: actual and mass-produced components of drive, in terms of which its parameters close to the optimal ones were determined, and the maximum relative error of the obtained useful power value of the servo pneumatic drive was estimated. The paper presents design features of two types of the servo pneumatic drive created, taking into account the proposed target function, implemented according to the schemes "hidden" and "spaced apart". The experimental static characteristic of the servo pneumatic drive is presented. Based on the results the following conclusions were drawn. The proposed target function can be used in the synthesis of servo pneumatic / hydraulic drives with translational motion of the end-effector using genetic algorithms. The useful power of the pneumatic cylinder, obtained during its synthesis, differs from the optimal value by 1. 92 %. Tests of the prototype of this pneumatic cylinder confirm that its use is expedient. </p...|$|R

30|$|In a <b>servo</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the oil seal between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the oil seal edges of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and oil edge sealing, the oil chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and oil seal changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|E
