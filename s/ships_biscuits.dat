50|$|The Invercauld {{was under}} the command of Captain George Dalgarno and was bound from Melbourne to Callao in ballast with a total of 25 crew. She struck the Auckland Islands at 2 am on 11 May 1864, broke up and was totally {{destroyed}} in a short amount of time. The crew all struggled towards a small cove nearby and nineteen of the twenty-five crew managed to get ashore. Crew members Middleton and Wilson and four others drowned. All of the rest were hurt in some way and had no shoes. The survivors spent the night onshore and then at daybreak investigated the scene of the wreck and came away with only some few pounds of <b>ships</b> <b>biscuits</b> and salted pork. They found the bodies of the drowned crew and stripped them of their clothing but were unable to bury them.|$|E
5000|$|The Dean {{was noted}} for his {{knowledge}} of several European languages, and had invited Miss Phillpotts and the brother who was accompanying her to visit him, and {{to stay at the}} house overnight. After a long ride, in which lunch was somehow omitted, they arrived at about three oclock and greeted the Dean in the Icelandic language. The Dean replied in fluent English, begging them to use their own language, since it was so many years since he had had the pleasure of hearing or using it. They then entered a large room filled with books and with current numbers of the more important European journals. The Dean had many questions and comments on a great range of subjects and held their interest although both were hungry and longing for tea. This however continued until about 7 pm, when the Deans daughter, a girl about sixteen years old, announced that supper was ready, and they all adjourned to a neighbouring room where plates and mugs were laid out on a long and otherwise bare table. Their host then placed a piece of dried fish on each plate, while the daughter poured sour milk into each mug. The only other amenity was in the presence of hard <b>ships</b> <b>biscuits.</b> Her brother managed with some appearance of success, but Miss Phillpotts, without tools or strong teeth, could make no impression on either fish or biscuits, so she passed one of the latter to her brother surreptitiously, hoping he could break it for her. This he did to the satisfaction of a large dog under the table, who snapped it up from his hand as he was passing it back to her. At this point the Dean noticed the untouched fish, and remarking that it was too hard he carried it in his hands to an adjoining room, beat it on an anvil with a hammer and returned with a handful of shreds which he placed on her plate. With this assistance and with the sour milk, which she found very distasteful, she managed to secure some sustenance. After this rather scant meal conversation was resumed until about ten oclock, when they pleaded fatigue and begged leave to retire. The room assigned to Miss Phillpotts was at ground level. Piles of back numbers of journals and magazines were on the floor, leaving only narrow paths where the bed and the wash-stand could be approached. Alas, the bed was infested by vermin which, on speedy investigation, seemed to emerge from layers of old suits spread beneath the mattress. Sleep being impossible, she climbed through the window to seek an adjoining barn or outhouse, but its door was locked and the Deans voice from within called, [...] "Whos there?", so she retreated hastily and spent the next hours huddled outside her bedroom window. Soon after daybreak she re-entered the room, desiring to have a wash, but while she was doing this a knock came on her door. She called, [...] "Dont come in," [...] but the door opened and in walked a pony, which approached, gave her a deliberate (and painful) kick with one of his front legs and then walked calmly away. The Dean was already sitting at his desk when she entered his study soon after 7 am. When she told him of the extraordinary behaviour of his pony he laughed and said, [...] "Oh, thats a little way he has; he was only saying good morning!" [...] Shortly after, her brother arrived, explaining that he had been to the stream in the vicinity hoping to catch some fish for breakfast, but had had no success. While he was speaking the pony walked in, and before Miss Phillpotts could warn him, gave her brother the same playful kick which she had herself received in the bedroom; the same explanation followed from the Dean. By that time breakfast was announced. This proved to be a repetition of the supper of the previous day and equally incapable of satisfying their hunger, so they resolved to make their excuses as soon as possible and to seek accommodation, or at least a meal, at the nearest farmhouse which might be thirty miles away. So they departed...|$|E

5000|$|Hardtack (or hard tack) is {{a simple}} type of biscuit or cracker, made from flour, water, and {{sometimes}} salt. Hardtack is inexpensive and long-lasting. It is used for sustenance {{in the absence of}} perishable foods, commonly during long sea voyages, land migrations, and military campaigns. The name derives from the British sailor slang for food, [...] "tack". It is known by other names such as brewis (possibly a cognate with [...] "brose"), cabin bread, pilot bread, sea biscuit, sea bread (as rations for sailors), <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuit,</b> or <b>ship</b> <b>biscuit,</b> or pejoratively as [...] "dog biscuits", [...] "molar breakers", [...] "sheet iron", [...] "tooth dullers", or [...] "worm castles". Australian and New Zealand military personnel knew them with some sarcasm as ANZAC wafers (not to be confused with Anzac biscuit).|$|R
50|$|A water biscuit {{or water}} cracker {{is a type}} of biscuit or cracker. Water {{biscuits}} are baked using only flour and water, without shortening or other fats usually used in biscuit production. They are thin, hard and brittle, and usually served with cheese or wine. Originally produced in the 19th century as a version of the <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuit,</b> water biscuits continue to be popular in the United Kingdom, with the leading brands (Carr's and Jacob's) selling over seventy million packets a year.|$|R

50|$|These {{biscuits}} {{were created}} as a <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuit,</b> for long sea voyages by Venetian ships. Being very dry, these biscuits maintain their consistency for a long duration, when properly stored in the distinctive yellow tin boxes {{in which they are}} traditionally sold. Their preparation, which is long and laborious, has two acts of leavening and double baking.|$|R
60|$|We have {{referred}} to breakfast, but the meal spread before the castaways hardly merits that name, for it consisted of only a small slice of pork to each; {{a few pieces of}} <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuit</b> that Slag had discovered in his pockets; and a cup of water drawn from the pond which had accumulated in a hollow of the tarpaulin during the night.|$|R
5000|$|Crackers are eaten {{on their}} own or can {{accompany}} other food items, such as cheese or meat slices; dips; or soft spreads such as jam, butter, or peanut butter. Bland or mild crackers are sometimes used as a palate cleanser in food product testing or flavor testing, between samples. A precedent for the modern cracker can be found in nautical <b>ship</b> <b>biscuits,</b> military hardtack, and sacramental bread.|$|R

50|$|Musciame was a basic {{element of}} the diet of Ligurian seamen, who ate it with <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuit</b> {{softened}} with sea-water and vinegar, accompanied by vegetables. It is eaten very thinly sliced; it may be simply seasoned with olive oil, or served on slices of tomato, or accompanied by boiled beans and onion. If the meat is particularly hard it {{may need to be}} softened by soaking in cold water for a few hours.|$|R
50|$|Nineteenth-century sailors made lobscouse by boiling salted meat, {{onions and}} pepper, with <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuit</b> used to thicken the dish.

Scouse is a stew, similar to Lancashire hotpot, usually of mutton, lamb (often neck) or beef with vegetables, typically potatoes, carrots and onions. It is commonly served with pickled beetroot or cabbage and bread.|$|R

6000|$|Captain Truck {{said little}} to his {{passengers}} concerning this adventure; {{but when he}} had lighted a cigar, and was discussing the matter with his chief-mate, he told the latter there was [...] "just one minute when {{he would not have}} given a <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuit</b> for both vessels, nor much more for their cargoes.

50|$|In 1829 {{he invented}} steam-powered {{machinery}} for making <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuits</b> that were stamped into hexagonal shapes, thereby ensuring {{that there was}} no waste. This process speeded up the production process and substantially reduced its costs. Other government departments copied the invention, saving the British taxpayer a great deal of money. As a reward Grant was given a £2,000 grant by parliament and received a medal from the French king, Louis Philippe, and a gold medal from the Society of Arts in London.|$|R

60|$|Breakfast was not {{a tempting}} meal. The {{biscuits}} were, indeed, as good as <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuits</b> ever are, and when moistened with sea water formed a comparatively pleasant as well as strengthening food; but the barrel of pork was raw; they had no means of cooking it, and had not yet experienced those pangs of hunger which induce men to luxuriate in anything that will allay the craving. They therefore breakfasted chiefly on biscuit, merely making an attempt, with wry faces, to swallow a little pork.|$|R
60|$|The {{worst of}} it was also {{that we had a}} little food, a few hard <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuits,</b> which we had saved up for a purpose, namely, to feed Maqueda. This was how we managed it.

Then we would all pretend to eat also, saying how much we felt refreshed by the food and how we longed for more, smacking our lips and biting on a piece of wood so that she could not help hearing us.|$|R

50|$|Forty of Cartagena's mutineers {{were sentenced}} to death, though Magellan {{immediately}} commuted the sentences and permitted the men {{to return to their}} previous stations within a few days and to serve in chains for a period of a few days. Stronger action was required against the ringleader Cartagena, but Magellan was reluctant to execute a close relative of Fonseca. Instead, on August 24 1520 Cartagena and another conspirator, the priest Pedro Sánchez de la Reina, were given a small supply of <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuits</b> and drinking water and then marooned on an island off the Patagonian coast. Neither was heard from again.|$|R
50|$|On the Board, each Commissioner had {{responsibility}} for a key area of victualling activity: the Brewhouse department, the Cutting House department, the Dry Goods department, Cooperage, Hoytaking and Stores. There were seven Commissioners; the aforementioned six, plus the Chairman (who had direct oversight of the Cash department). The Victualling Board proceeded to build breweries, slaughterhouses, mills and bakeries near to the Royal Navy Dockyards to provide beer, salted meat, <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuits,</b> etc under its own quality control. In 1725, the Victualling Commissioners, the Navy Board, the Sick and Hurt Commissioners and the Navy Pay Office all moved into new accommodation in Somerset House.|$|R
50|$|Nüzül was {{designed}} as a form of requisitioning from farms, to feed Ottoman armed forces; large quantities of food were needed to support Ottoman armies in the field. Flour was a major constituent in the 16th-17th century. Producers were expected to deliver nüzül to the required destination, and were not paid for this. Nüzül was supervised by the local kadis, an official who acted as both a judge and a tax-collector; Ottoman central government determined the kadi's jurisdiction, and set the levels of taxes to be collected - they were even required to arrange supplies of <b>ship</b> <b>biscuit,</b> in parallel with nüzül provision.|$|R
50|$|Faced with a {{constant}} {{threat to its}} maritime possessions, Venice {{had little choice but}} to maintain a standing fleet of dozens of galleys on a war footing in peacetime, bolstered in times of actual war by over a hundred galleys held in reserve. To oversee the efficient supply and administration of such a force required an extensive organisational effort, leading to the creation of the office of the Magistrato alla Milizia da Mar (Commissioner of naval forces) responsible for the construction and maintenance of ships and cannon, provision of <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuits</b> and other <b>ship's</b> stores, weapons and gunpowder, recruitment of crews and the management of finances.|$|R
2500|$|A cracker {{is a type}} of biscuit that {{developed}} from military hardtack and nautical <b>ship</b> <b>biscuits.</b> Crackers are now usually eaten with soup, or topped with cheese, caviar, or other delicacies. The holes in crackers are called [...] "docking" [...] holes as a means to stop air pockets from forming in the cracker while baking. Crackers trace their origin to the year 1792 when John Pearson of Newburyport, Massachusetts invented a cracker-like bread product from just flour and water that he called [...] "pilot bread". An immediate success with sailors because of its shelf life, it also became distinctly known as a hardtack or sea biscuit for long voyages away from home while at sea.|$|R
50|$|In 1824, James married Elizabeth Masters (1799 - 1867). The {{couple had}} eight children. By 1857, {{two of his}} late-teenage sons had {{announced}} {{that they were not}} going to join the family tea import business. James wanted them in a complementary trade and proposed that they start a biscuit business. After founding the business, the two sons quickly decided on a different course (one died in his early 20s; the other emigrated to North America). As a consequence James needed someone to run the biscuit business. One of his nieces, Hannah Peek, had recently married George Hender Frean, a miller and <b>ship</b> <b>biscuit</b> maker in Devon, so James wrote to George asking him to manage the new biscuit business.|$|R
5000|$|Salted {{meat and}} fish are {{a staple of}} the diet in North Africa, Southern China, Scandinavia, coastal Russia, and in the Arctic. Salted meat was {{a staple of the}} mariner's diet in the Age of Sail. It was stored in barrels, and often had to last for months spent out of sight of land. The basic Royal Navy diet {{consisted}} of salted beef, salted pork, <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuit,</b> and oatmeal, supplemented with smaller quantities of peas, cheese and butter. [...] Even in 1938, Eric Newby found the diet on the tall ship Moshulu to consist almost entirely of salted meat. Moshulu's lack of refrigeration left little choice as the ship made voyages which could exceed 100 days passage between ports.|$|R
60|$|After {{sitting in}} a half-sleeping {{condition}} for some time, he aroused himself, and crept with considerable difficulty to the bow to procure the blanket which had covered {{the two men who}} had just perished. A corner of the blanket had caught on the end of one of the floor-planks. In disengaging it Dominick chanced to raise the plank which was loose, and observed something like a bundle lying underneath. Curiosity prompted him to examine it. He found that it was wrapped in canvas, and carefully tied with cord. Opening it he discovered to his surprise and intense joy that it contained some <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuit,</b> a piece of boiled pork, and a flask of water.|$|R
60|$|My {{treasure}} {{was so much}} admired that I {{was afraid}} it would be ravished from me, and I hid it {{in all sorts of}} places, like a magpie with a stolen spoon. I never went on deck without taking it with me for safe keeping. I never woke in the morning without burrowing under my mattress {{to see if it was}} safe, and never turned in for the night without seeing that I was prepared for shipwreck by having my life-preserver handy and half-a-dozen <b>ship</b> <b>biscuits,</b> a bottle of water, and the precious box lashed firmly together, for with that dearly bought watch I was resolved to sink or swim, live or die.|$|R
60|$|Mark now arose, {{and found}} himself sensibly {{improved}} by his night's rest, the washing, and the nourishment received, little as the last had been. His {{first step was to}} empty the tumbler, bread and all. Then he took another bath, the last doing quite as much good, he fancied, as his breakfast. All that day, the young man managed his case with the same self-denial and prudence, consuming a <b>ship's</b> <b>biscuit</b> {{in the course of the}} next twenty-four hours, and taking two or three glasses of the wine, mixed with water and sweetened with sugar. In the afternoon he endeavoured to shave, but the first effort convinced him he was getting well too fast.|$|R
