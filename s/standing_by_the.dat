5|$|In 2010, {{after leading}} the {{division}} <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of April, the Mets again began to struggle. The Mets would not hold first place {{at any point}} after May 1, although they came close in mid-June. By {{the end of the}} season the Mets had finished 18 games behind the first place Phillies. For its part, Philadelphia was mainly engaged in a fierce division race with the Atlanta Braves, trailing them as late in the season as September 6. However, Philadelphia would surge at the end of the month and once again be crowned division champs. 2010 ultimately served as a disappointment for the Mets–Phillies rivalry.|$|E

At Tabgha on the Sea of Galilee, Zahir built five fountains, one of which remained <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 19th century. That remaining fountain was the largest {{of its kind in}} Galilee. In {{the village of}} I'billin, Zahir's brother Yusuf built fortifications and a mosque. The I'billin fortress was later used as the headquarters of Aqil Agha, the 19th century semi-autonomous Arab sheikh of Galilee.|$|E

5|$|Racial {{violence}} {{at the time}} was common throughout the nation, manifested as individual incidents of extra-legal actions, or attacks on entire communities. Lynchings reached a peak around the start of the 20th century as southern states were disenfranchising black voters and imposing white supremacy; white supremacists used it as a means of social control throughout the South. In 1866 Florida, as did many Southern states, passed laws called Black Codes disenfranchising black citizens. Although these were quickly overturned, and black citizens enjoyed a brief period of improved social <b>standing,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century black political influence was virtually nil. The white Democrat-dominated legislature passed a poll tax in 1885, which largely served to disenfranchise all poor voters. Losing political power, black voters suffered a deterioration of their legal and political rights in the years following. Without the right to vote, they were excluded as jurors and could not run for office, effectively excluding them from the political process. The United States as a whole was experiencing rapid social changes: an influx of European immigrants, industrialization and the growth of cities, and political experimentation in the North. In the South, black Americans grew increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of economic opportunity and status as second-class citizens.|$|E

500|$|In the {{illustration}} of Peter <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> locked door, the verbal narrative describes the scene without the flippancy {{evident in the}} moment of the sieve. The inability to overcome obstacles is presented in the verbal narrative with objective matter-of-factness and the statement, [...] "Peter began to cry" [...] is offered without irony or attitude, thus drawing the reader closer to Peter’s emotions and plight. The illustration depicts an unclothed Peter standing upright against the door, one foot upon the other with a tear running from his eye. Without his clothes, Peter is only a small, wild animal but his tears, his emotions, and his human posture intensifies the reader’s identification with him. Here, verbal narrative and illustration work in harmony rather than in disharmony. Scott suggests Potter’s tale has encouraged many generations of children to [...] "self-indulgence, disobedience, transgression of social boundaries and ethics, and assertion of their wild, unpredictable nature against the constrictions of civilized living." ...|$|E

He sometimes spoke aloud to unseen presences, and at least once he flew into a violent rage when the question of Ted's paternity was raised. Bundy described his grandmother as a timid and obedient woman who periodically underwent electroconvulsive therapy for depression and feared leaving their house toward the end of her life.

500|$|Located nearby at Jin Shui Kopitiam ("kopitiam" [...] means [...] "coffeeshop" [...] in Hokkien) is a stall selling Sungei Road laksa, a local spicy {{noodle soup}} that {{originated}} from Peranakan culture. The Sungei Road laksa legacy {{was started in}} 1956 when a Hainanese friend of Wong, Ah Tong, gave Wong and his brother Wong Yew Poh, his secret recipe for laksa on account of their long-standing friendship. The Wong brothers set up a push-cart stall to sell their laksa and the response to their recipe was overwhelming. It was sold with the thick bee hoon (Chinese noodle) cut up and served only with a spoon, without chopsticks, topped with cockles, bean sprouts and home-made fried fish cakes in distinctive chicken motif bowls. Customers ate it while <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> roadside and it cost only 20 cents a bowl back then. By day, they sold along Johor Road and by night, off Sungei Road. Today, the brothers have since lost contact with Ah Tong, but their children still serve the traditional recipe, using charcoal fire to keep his gravy constantly warm to maintain its distinctive flavour. It is regarded among the best laksa stalls in Singapore by many food reviewers.|$|E
500|$|A cruiser {{reported}} aircraft {{detected by}} R.D.F {{on the port}} bow of the convoy and Ledbury was taken through the convoy {{to get to the}} engaged side; but a heavy and sustained attack by Junkers 88s dive bombing developed when the destroyer was still in between the two columns. The attack became increasingly indefensible; two ships were hit, one exploded, the other remained afloat but both were creating a huge mass of burning petrol on the water. Torpedo planes were now sighted on the starboard bow very close, but the light was failing quickly. Ledbury engaged the torpedo planes, but one delivered a very good attack, dropping two torpedoes. Another ship exploded, and Captain Hill assumed that [...] was torpedoed at this time. Ledbury called Manchester to make sure that she was <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> damaged ships; the destroyer sighted six ships out in the darkness steaming on various courses, mostly in a north or north-western direction.

Ledbury then returned to Ohio intending to take her in tow, but the tanker reported that she could steam with her steering aft but had no compass. The destroyer switched on a brighter stern light and told the tanker to follow her to Malta. Ledbury informed stragglers of the presence of a minefield near Zembra, while she also contacted [...] that the survivors from the damaged ships had not been picked up and that she was going on with the tanker. It seemed to the crew that a very long time had passed before the ships were clear of the glare of the burning ships.

500|$|After the fiasco at the bar, Mulder and Scully meet. She sadly tells Mulder {{that she}} does not think he and Fletcher can be {{returned}} to their own bodies. However, soon after that, the warp caused by the alien craft begins to snap back and repair the natural order of the universe. Grodin, realizing that everything will be fixed naturally, gathers up Lana Chee and the pilot. Scully and Fletcher arrive at Fletcher’s home, and see Mulder <b>standing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> moving truck. Joanne Fletcher berates Mulder about Scully but he insists that he and Fletcher have swapped bodies. Fletcher goes to help Joanne move a chair and confesses that Mulder is telling the truth. He tells her enough of their past to convince her he is Morris Fletcher. Jeff Smoodge and a group of troops appear at Fletcher's home and detain Mulder, Fletcher, Scully and the flight data recorder in their car. Grodin explains that he is restoring everything and that he reversed the body-swap between the pilot and the old Hopi woman. The warp passes over them and the past few days are rewritten. Mulder and Fletcher are restored to their own bodies and returned to the moment when Fletcher’s troops pulled them over on the highway. This time no ship passes overhead and Mulder and Scully leave uneventfully. After Mulder and Scully leave the highway near area 51, Scully calls from FBI headquarters to tell Mulder that they have escaped reprimand from Director Kersh for going to Nevada. Scully opens her desk drawer to place a file inside and finds the penny and dime that were fused together from the event at the gas station in her desk drawer indicating that while some things have reversed themselves, not everything has. [...] Mulder enters his apartment and finds that Morris Fletcher has completely reorganized and cleaned his apartment and both Mulder and Scully are left to puzzle over their recollection of events.|$|E
