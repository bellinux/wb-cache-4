This circulation net has a big importance, it’s the way of direct communication between the specific site of the skin and the lymph cells found inside the lymph node and the systematic tissues.The epidermis antigens are connected with some cells of the skin. Among them there are the APC, antigen presenting cells (Langerhans, dentritic and cutaneous). They capture the antigen, they process it and they present it on their surface as being associated with the MHC-II. Keratinocytes produce TNFα and IL-1 which act on the Langerhans cells, inducing an increase of the expression of histocompatibility complex and cytokine secretion. Moreover, they induce their migration from the skin to the paracortical areas of the lymph nodes. Once there, these cells can provide the necessary stimulus for the lymphocytes T, who will proliferate and express the cutaneous receptor recruitment and to various chemo attractants that promote the accumulation of dermal micro vascular endothelial cells of inflamed skin to finally enter the skin tissue.Once the activated lymphocytes arrive, they get in contact with the antigen, they proliferate and develop their effector functions in order to neutralize or eliminate the pathogen. The Langerhans cells promote and permit the start of the cellular immune response of lymphocytes through the skin and are recruited from the peripheral blood. Antigen presentation may occur in peripheral lymphoid tissues.|$|E

Analysis on tensile properties of <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolled samples showed for an ultralow C grade and a low C grade a decreasing trend of the yield strength down to a minimum, followed by progressive rising values with increasing rolling elongation. This trend was related to changes of the tensile curve shape, leading to a transition from discontinuous to continuous yielding. A zinc-coated mild steel grade featured a tensile curve with a knee at transition from elastic to plastic regime. Accordingly, the change in yield strength with increasing <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> elongation followed a linear trend. Microstructural and crystallographic information supplied by EBSD analyses suggested that the plastic strain induced by <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolling originated a fairly homogeneous deformation field even on grains directly exposed on the strip surface.

40|$|The common {{grades of}} steel used in roll forming are: hot rolled carbon steel, high {{strength}} low alloy and recovery annealed cold rolled sheet. These steels {{are prone to}} ageing and are often skin passed and/or roller leveled to eliminate ageing as it can lead to problems in forming. In roll forming, shape defects such as bow, twist and camber are considered to be related to very small plastic strains in the longitudinal direction and hence knowledge of the material properties in the elastic plastic transition range is necessary if the process is to be modelled accurately. Previous studies with aluminium have indicated that <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolling can lead to residual stresses in the strip. In this work, the study was extended to aged carbon steel and to the effect of roller leveling on both aged material and strip that had been given a light cold rolling to simulate a <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> treatment.

Recent investigations have shown that residual stresses change the material behavior close to the yield in a bending test. So, residual stresses introduced during prior steel processing operations may affect the roll forming process, and therefore {{they need to be}} included in roll forming simulations to achieve improved model accuracy. Measuring the residual stress profile experimentally is time consuming and has limited accuracy while analytical models that are available require detailed information about the pre-processing conditions that is generally not available for roll forming materials.

Thereafter, the semi-finished part is manufactured to a component by sheet metal forming operations like deep drawing. During such process chains, a strong evolution of the microstructure and the resulting mechanical properties can be observed. Due to the occurring finite plastic deformations and the accompanied increase in dislocation density during the cold rolling process, the grain structure is extremely deformed and the orientations of the grains are changed. In contrast to hot-rolled metals, the cold-rolled material shows recrystallization by temperature rise. The recrystallization processes are required to adjust the mechanical behaviour of the annealed material. For process optimization, it is essential to understand the combined process of cold-rolling and annealing: i. e. how the microstructure like the grain orientations evolves and also how that influences the mechanical behaviour. Only detailed knowledge about the microstructural evolution enables to find the optimal design of such process chains.

In the present study, the surface defect was characterized by visual inspection, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopic analysis to understand the source and mechanism of the defect. In the visual inspection, these peculiar surface appearances were observed in fuel tank at three distinct locations. The SEM examination exhibited two distinct regions {{on the surface}} apart from the normal galvanized surface: (1) galvannealed, (2) mixture of galvanized and galvannealed texture.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} {{of the effect of}} plastic deformation on the calculated excess loss component (anomalous-loss) supports the concept of loss separation. Magnetic losses and Barkhausen noise of nonoriented electrical steel sheets were measured on Epstein strips taken from a single coil of 0. 8 % Si nonoriented electrical steel. Sheets were extracted in the annealed condition, without any <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> and with a grain size of 18 mu m. This material was cold rolled in order to obtain sets of samples with true strain from 2 % up to 29 %. X-ray diffraction was used to estimate the dislocation density. The analysis of magnetic properties was performed by Barkhausen noise measurements and also by analyzing the hysteresis loops obtained from Epstein frame measurements for different inductions and different frequencies (including the quasi-static regime for hysteresis loss measurements). These data allowed us to observe that most of the well known total loss increase with plastic deformation is due to an increase in the hysteresis loss component, while excess loss decreases to become negligible. This behavior can be explained if it is assumed that the plastic deformation lead to {{an increase in the number}} of domain walls per unit volume, thereby decreasing the excess loss.

40|$|The {{process chain}} for sheet metals after casting to produce {{components}} made of semi-finished products {{is complex and}} the resulting mechanical properties of the produced material depend strongly {{on the evolution of}} the microstructure. After casting, a typical process chain consists of hot rolling, cold rolling, annealing, <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> rolling, and sheet metal forming. In order to represent the microstructure evolution in an adequate way, a multiscale modeling concept is applied for the process steps cold rolling, annealing, and sheet metal forming. In this Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) concept, the strong microstructure evolution during the production of semi-finished products is modeled by using crystal plasticity for the representation of the cold rolling process and a cellular automaton is incorporated to model the annealing procedure. In both cases, only the microstructure in an adequate unit cell is considered. For sheet metal forming, the whole component has to be simulated together with the interaction between workpiece and the forming tools in order to solve technological problems like springback. For this purpose, classical macroscopic plasticity models have been applied. To connect the different length scales of the modeling approaches, a scale transition on the basis of numerical homogenization is introduced for the determination of the mechanical properties like the multi-axial yield behavior. These information are required to virtually determine the type of the macroscopic plasticity model, the material parameters of the plasticity model, and to simulate sheet metal forming processes. In the article, the different modeling approaches are compared step by step with experimental investigations in order to prove the predictability of each modeling technique...|$|E
40|$|The {{metal strip}} used in roll forming {{has often been}} preprocessed by (tension or roller) {{leveling}} or by skin-pass rolling, and as a consequence, may contain residual stresses. These stresses are not well observed by the tensile test, but could {{have a significant effect}} on the bending and springback behavior. With the advent of improved process design techniques for roll forming, including advanced finite element techniques, the need for precise material property data has become important. The major deformation mode of roll forming is that of bending combined with unloading and reverse bending, and hence property data derived from bend tests could be more relevant than that from tensile testing. This work presents a numerical study on the effect of skin passing on the material behavior of stainless steel strip in pure bending and tension. A two dimensional (2 -D) numerical model was developed using Abaqus Explicit to analyze the affect of skin passing on the residual stress profile across a section for various working conditions. The deformed meshes and their final stress fields were then imported as pre-defined fields into Abaqus Standard, and the post-skin passing material behavior in pure bending was determined. The results show that a residual stress profile is introduced into the steel strip during skin passing, and that its shape and stress level depend on the overall thickness reduction as well as the number of rolling passes used in the skin passing process. The material behavior in bending and the amount of springback changed significantly depending on the <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{indirect}} rnatrix converter {{has been}} the subject to investigation for some time. One of the favorable features of this con verter is the absence of a de-link capacitar, which allows for the construction of compact converters capable of operating at adverse atmospheric conditions such as extreme temperatures and pressures. These features have been explored extensively and are the main reasons why the matrix converters family has been investigated for decades. The indirect matrix converter features an easy to implement and secure commutation technique, the de-link zero current commutation. Moreover, the conventional indirect matrix converter has bidirectional power flow capabilities and it can be designed to have small sized reactive elements in its input filter. These characteristics make the matrix converter a suitable technology for high efficiency converters for specific applications such as military, aerospace, wind turbine generator system, external elevators for building construction and <b>skin</b> <b>pass</b> mill, where these advantages make up for the additional cost of an indirect matrix converter compared to conventional converters. This converter uses complex pulse width modulation and space vector modulation schemes to achieve the goal of unity displacement power factor and sinusoidal output current. Thanks to technological advances, fast and powerful microprocessors are used for the control and modulation of power converters. To deal with the high processing power needed for these microprocessors, some research has shown the positive potential of model-based predictive control techniques in many power electronics applications. While there are a few challenges to the predictive control method, it has been demonstrated as an appealing alternative to power converters control because its concepts are very intuitive and easy to understand, and it can be applied {{to a wide variety of}} systems. In addition, it may involve multiple variable systems and non-linear constraints, making it an easy controller to implement, especially since it is open to modifications and extensions for specific applications. Predictive current control can be described as a particular case of model-based predictive control which takes into account the inherent discrete nature of the switching states of the power converter and the digital implementation. JVIost of predictive current control methods applied in matrix converters take into consideration the output current regulation and the reactive power minimization on the input side, obtaining input currents in phase with their respective phase voltages. However, this cannot ensure that they present a sinusoidal waveform, especially when harmonic distortion in the source voltage or strong resonances on the input filter are present. To enhance the quality of the source current, in this document is illustrate how the predictive current control can be applied to an indirect matrix converter and how both source and load currents waveforms can be controlled...|$|E
