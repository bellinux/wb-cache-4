25|$|In a December 15, 2016 {{interview}} by NPR journalist <b>Steve</b> <b>Inskeep,</b> Obama said the U.S. government {{would respond to}} Russia via overt and covert methods, in order to send an unambiguous symbol {{to the world that}} any such interference would have harsh consequences. He added that motive behind the Russian operation could better be determined after completion of the intelligence report he ordered. Obama emphasized that Russian efforts caused more harm to Clinton than to Trump during the campaign. At a press conference the following day, he highlighted his September 2016 admonition to Putin to cease engaging in cyberwarfare against the U.S. Obama explained that the U.S. did not publicly reciprocate against Russia's actions due to a fear such choices would appear partisan. President Obama minimized conflict between his administration and the Trump transition, stressing cyber warfare against the U.S. should be a bipartisan issue.|$|E
