40|$|Burned magnesia-chromite bricks are the {{standard}} product for {{the lining of}} furnaces in lead industry, where the short service life is a great problem. Used sintered magnesia-chromite brick sample from short rotary furnace lining, sent by a secondary lead manufacturer, showed parallel cracks to the hot face due to <b>structural</b> <b>spalling</b> damage. The refractory infiltrated region and slag interface were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive spectroscopy analyzer, and X-ray diffraction powder analysis. Crucible corrosion test was performed to evaluate the influence of slag attack. The {{results showed that the}} <b>structural</b> <b>spalling</b> was due to strong Pb-infiltration of the refractory microstructure by bath components of the furnace (metallic lead and lead sulphite) during the reduction process and that the slag infiltration had little contribution due to the good resistance of the magnesia-chromite bricks to FeO rich slag attack...|$|E
40|$|Refractories play a {{vital role}} in {{slagging}} gasifier on-line availability and profitability for the next clean power generation system. A recent survey of gasifier users by USDOE indicated that a longer service life of refractories is the highest need among gasifier operators. Currently, Cr 2 O 3 based refractories, the best of commercially available materials for use in slagging gasifiers, last between 3 and 24 months. Researchers at Albany Research Center (ARC) have identified <b>structural</b> <b>spalling,</b> caused by slag penetration, as one of the major failure mechanisms of Cr 2 O 3 refractories through postmortem analysis. New Cr 2 O 3 refractories with phosphate additives have been developed by ARC to decrease slag penetration and thus <b>structural</b> <b>spalling.</b> Laboratory physical property tests indicated that ARC developed refractories are superior to other commercial bricks. One of the ARC developed phosphate containing refractories has been installed in a slagging gasifier. Preliminary results of the performance of this refractory in the gasifier will be reported along with research to develop non-chromia refractories...|$|E
40|$|Iron {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} resources that can be found in the lithosphere; 90 % of all metal ores extracted are iron ore. Many steps are included in the extraction from iron ore to metallic iron, where the processes vary between different producers. Iron ore pellets, are a prepared burden material for ironmaking in the blast furnace. Such pellets are commonly sintered in a grate-kiln furnace system, where the kiln usually is insulated with mullite containing bricks. Different mechanisms wear these bricks and they need to be replaced regularly and this causes production stops. The slag present in the kiln consists of ~ 95 % hematite, alkali-, alkaline earth- and other oxides, mainly from pellets that have disintegrated and adheres in chunks on the bricks. This study is focusing on the interaction between refractories and slags that occurs in kilns during the sintering process in the iron ore pellet production. Results are shown from lab scale experiments, and from samples collected in industrial furnaces, commonly called rotary kilns. Slag/brick compatibility tests were performed in a laboratory furnace at various temperatures, holding times and atmospheres. Slag collected from a production kiln and three commercial bricks, in powder or solid form, were used. Deliberate additions of alkali species were included in order to evaluate their influence. XRD, DSC, TG and in-situ mass spectrometry confirm that addition of alkali dissolves the mullite in the bricks, and forms the phase nepheline (Na 2 O•Al 2 O 3 • 2 SiO 2), which disintegrate to an amorphous phase at elevated temperature. QEMSCAN were used to view mineralogical mappings of different chemical phases by field image scans. It was found that when alkali penetrates the surface of the brick, besides formation of nepheline, phases as kalsilite (K 2 O•Al 2 O 3 • 2 SiO 2), leucite (K 2 O•Al 2 O 3 • 4 SiO 2) and potassium â-alumina (K 2 O• 11 Al 2 O 3) are formed. Also seen is that potassium penetrates deeper, and in larger amounts than sodium in the lining material. Formations of alkali containing phases as the feldspathoid minerals kalsilite and nepheline are coupled to an expansion in the lining material, observed by dilatometry, causing <b>structural</b> <b>spalling</b> observed as cracks in some of the slag/brick compatibility tests. Grains of hematite with sizes between 50 - 100 ìm stay on the original surface of the brick, while micrometer sized hematite migrates through the dissolved brick by capillary infiltration and diffusion, and nucleates in needle formations deeper in the lining material. We propose a wear mechanism of the bricks in an iron ore pellet producing kiln that involves these chemical reactions in combination with erosion by the continuously flowing slag.

40|$|This {{preliminary}} {{paper is}} {{a progress report}} on an analytical investigation into the implications of explosive spalling on the fire performance of reinforced concrete structural elements and whole structures. This study does not attempt to predict whether spalling will occur. For accurate prediction of the occurrence of spalling a complete and fully coupled hygro-thermal-mechanical (HTM) analysis is required, as described by {{a comprehensive review of}} current research into the parameters and mechanisms that influence spalling, including a review of physical spalling criteria. This paper describes the <b>structural</b> performance of <b>spalled</b> concrete elements, using finite element analysis where spalling is modelled by removing layers of concrete when a set of spalling criteria are met. The method is presented using a case study of a simply supported reinforced concrete beam, where the analytical results indicate that spalling invariably triggers an early failure (well short of the required FRR rating) of a beam exposed to the standard fire...|$|R
30|$|Structural fire {{design of}} modern {{reinforced}} and prestressed concrete structures {{relies on the}} assumption that the concrete will not spall during fire. This assumption is based largely on data from large-scale standard fire tests of concrete elements tested in isolation in furnaces during the past 60 to 70 years. However, there is legitimate concern (Kelly and Purkiss 2008) that modern concrete structures, which incorporate concrete mixes with considerably higher concrete strengths, are more susceptible to spalling than was historically the case. Whilst preliminary guidance on the means by which spalling can be addressed by designers is available in the structural Eurocodes (CEN 2004), research is badly needed to understand the respective roles of the various factors which are known to increase a concrete’s propensity for spalling during fire (e.g. high strength, high stress, high moisture, low permeability, small amounts of bonded reinforcement, use of silica fume, rapid heating, etc.) (ArupFire 2005 Bailey and Khoury 2011), such that defensible preventative actions can be taken. For instance, more specific and defensible guidance is needed on the requirement to add a certain amount of polypropylene fibers to the concrete mix to prevent spalling. Interactions in real structures have the potential to significantly influence development of spalling in a fire, so large-scale tests under natural fires are needed to truly understand the propensity for, and the <b>structural</b> consequences of, <b>spalling</b> in real concrete structures.|$|R
40|$|Iron {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} resources in the lithosphere; 90 % of all metal ores extracted are based on iron. Many steps are included in the extraction of iron from ore, with extraction processes varying among different producers. Iron ore pellets are a prepared burden material for ironmaking in the blast furnace or by direct reduction. Such pellets can be sintered in a grate-kiln furnace system, in which the kiln is usually lined with mullite-containing bricks. These bricks degrade by various mechanisms, and need to be replaced regularly, which causes expensive production stops. Materials deposit in chunks on the lining in the kiln. These deposits comprise ~ 95 % hematite with oxides of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and others, which originate mainly from pellets that have disintegrated, but also from fly-ash from the burner fuel used to heat the kiln. This study investigated the interaction of deposit materials with refractory lining bricks in kilns during the sintering process in iron ore pellet production. Results are obtained from laboratory scale experiments, and from samples collected from industrial kilns, both in-situ and during production stops. Refractory/deposit compatibility tests were performed in a laboratory furnace at various temperatures, for different holding times, and in a number of atmospheres. Deposit materials collected from three commercial lining bricks in production kilns were analysed in both powder and solid forms. Deliberate additions of alkali species (carbonates of potassium and sodium) were made in order to evaluate their influence on degradation mechanisms. Analysis using scanning electron microscopy, QEMSCAN (quantitative evaluation of minerals by scanning electron microscopy), x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry and in-situ mass spectrometry confirmed that alkali additions in the deposit materials dissolve mullite in the liner bricks, which accelerates degradation. Phases such as nepheline (Na 2 O·Al 2 O 3 · 2 SiO 2), kalsilite (K 2 O·Al 2 O 3 · 2 SiO 2), leucite (K 2 O·Al 2 O 3 · 4 SiO 2) and potassium β-alumina (K 2 O· 11 Al 2 O 3) were formed. Moreover, it was observed that potassium penetrates deeper into the lining material, and in larger amounts, than sodium, both on the laboratory scale and in industrial furnaces. Formations of alkalicontaining phases such as the feldspathoid minerals kalsilite and nepheline are coupled with an expansion in the lining material, observed by dilatometry, which causes <b>structural</b> <b>spalling</b> that appears as cracks in some of the refractory/deposit compatibility tests. Grains of hematite with sizes between 50 - 100 μm remain on the original surface of the brick, whereas micrometer-scale hematite migrates through capillary infiltration (in pores, brick joints and cracks) and diffusion, and appears in finer grains deeper in the lining material. The degradation mechanisms of the bricks in an iron ore pellet producing kiln are shown to involve these chemical reactions in combination with thermomechanical stresses. Recommendations are given regarding the choice of materials, the design of refractory liners in the kilns to extend the time between production stops necessary for repair.

40|$|Most gasifiers are {{operated}} for refining, chemical production, {{and power}} generation. They are also considered a possible future source of H 2 for future power systems under consideration. A gasifier fulfills these roles by {{acting as a}} containment vessel to react carbon-containing raw materials with oxygen and water using fluidized-bed, moving-bed, or entrained-flow systems to produce CO and H 2, along with other gaseous by-products including CO 2, CH 4, SOx, HS, and/or NOx. The gasification process provides the opportunity to produce energy more efficiently and with less environmental impact than more conventional combustion processes. Because of these advantages, gasification is viewed {{as one of the}} key processes in the U. S. Department of Energy?s vision of an advanced power system for the 21 st Century. However, issues with both the reliability and the economics of gasifier operation will have to be resolved before gasification will be widely adopted by the power industry. Central to both enhanced reliability and economics is the development of materials with longer service lives in gasifier systems that can provide extended periods of continuous, trouble-free gasifier operation. The focus of the Advanced Refractories for Gasification project at the Albany Research Center (ARC) is to develop improved refractory liner materials capable of withstanding the harsh, high-temperature environment created by the gasification reaction. Current generation refractory liners in slagging gasifiers are typically replaced every 3 to 18 months at costs ranging up to $ 1, 000, 000 or more, depending upon the size of the gasification vessel. Compounding materials and installation costs are the lost-opportunity costs for the time that the gasifier is off-line for refractory repair/exchange. The goal of this project is to develop new refractory materials or to extend the service life of refractory liner materials currently used to at least 3 years. Post-mortem analyses of refractory brick removed from slagging commercial gasifiers and of laboratory produced refractory materials has indicated that slag corrosion and <b>structural</b> <b>spalling</b> are the primary causes of refractory failure. Historically, refractory materials with chrome oxide content as high as 90 pct have been found necessary to achieve the best refractory service life. To meet project goals, an improved high chrome oxide refractory material containing phosphate additions was developed at ARC, produced commercially, and is undergoing gasifier plant trials. Early laboratory tests on the high chrome oxide material suggested that phosphate additions could double the service life of currently available high chromium oxide refractories, translating into a potential savings {{of millions of dollars in}} annual gasifier operating costs, as well a significant increase in gasifier on-line availability. The ARC is also researching the potential of no-chrome/low-chrome oxide refractory materials for use in gasifiers. Some of the driving forces for no-chrome/low-chrome oxide refractories include the high cost and manufacturing difficulties of chrome oxide refractories and the fact that they have not met the performance requirements of commercial gasifiers. Development of no/low chrome oxide refractories is taking place through an examination of historical research, through the evaluation of thermodynamics, and through the evaluation of phase diagram information. This work has been followed by cup tests in the laboratory to evaluate slag/refractory interactions. Preliminary results of plant trials and the results of ARC efforts to develop no-chrome/low chrome refractory materials will be presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{by-products}} of coke dissolution in iron {{are primarily}} calcium aluminate minerals known as coke ash. These minerals are unreactive with the iron bath and can therefore deposit onto the blast furnace hearth refractories when they form below the iron-slag interface. This study {{was focused on}} understanding the interactions between these coke ash minerals and blast furnace hearth refractories. Improved understanding of these interactions may have implications for the campaign life of the blast furnace hearth refractory materials. It {{was found that the}} aluminosilicate refractory followed the linear rate law and the alumina carbon refractory corresponded to the logarithmic rate law. Thermodynamic modelling was conducted and compared with the spot analysis results and micrographs to determine the phases likely to have formed. It was found that the formation of gehlenite (Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7) and anorthite (CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8) were more likely in the reactions with the aluminosilicate refractory due to the higher silicon content in the refractory. This corresponds with the observation of this refractory following the linear rate law which is typical of a material which forms a non-protective reaction layer with high porosity or forms liquid phase reaction products. The rates of reaction were found to follow an Arrhenius relationship, demonstrating temperature dependence for the reactions between both hearth refractories and the calcium aluminates. The reaction rate was also observed to increase with the calcium content as predicted by Fick’s 1 st law of Diffusion. The Kirkendall effect was demonstrated via an inert wire test indicating net mass transport of material into the refractory materials from the calcium aluminates. This suggests that the active species responsible for most the reactions observed was the calcium ion. Detailed analysis using thermodynamic data was carried out to determine the possible reactions between the calcium aluminates and the refractory minerals. The formation of low liquidus temperature phases (anorthite and gehlenite) and the possible formation of liquid oxide phase were determined to increase the rate of refractory wear and limit the ability of the refractories to form a protective reaction layer. The formation of grossite (CaAl 4 O 7) and hibonite (CaAl 2 O 19) was found to make the refractory more susceptible to <b>structural</b> and thermal <b>spalling</b> due to the increased stress in the reaction layer cause by the volume change and variation in thermal expansion coefficients of the reaction products...|$|R
40|$|Maintaining {{structural}} stability {{is an integral}} component of building fire safety. Stability must be ensured to provide adequate time for safe egress of the buildings occupants, fire fighting operations and property protection. Structural fire engineering endeavours to design structures to withstand the effects of fire {{in order to achieve}} this objective. The behaviour of reinforced concrete in fire is not as well understood as other construction materials, such as steel. This is in part due to the complexity of concrete material behaviour and also due to concrete’s reputation of superior fire performance. Concrete technology is, however, continually evolving; structures are increasingly slender, more highly stressed and have higher compressive strengths. A more robust understanding of concrete’s behaviour in fire will enable predictions of the implications of changing concrete technology and also help to properly quantify the fire safety risk associated with concrete structures. A fundamental key to understanding structural fire performance is the relationship between the thermal environment induced by the fire and the structure. Significant thermal variation has been found experimentally to exist within fire compartments. Despite this the design of structures for fire almost universally assumes the compartment thermal environment to be homogeneous. In this thesis the implications of compartment fire non-uniformity for concrete structural behaviour is investigated to assess the validity of the uniform compartment temperature assumption. The investigation is conducted using numerical tools; a detailed review of the necessary background knowledge, material modelling of reinforced concrete, finite element modelling of reinforced concrete structures and compartment fire thermal variation is included. The behaviour of a two-way spanning reinforced concrete slab is used as a structural benchmark. The membrane behaviour exhibited by two-way spanning RC slabs at high temperatures has been previously studied under uniform thermal conditions. They therefore are an ideal benchmark for identifying the influence of non-uniform thermal environments for behaviour. The relationship between gas phase temperature variation and concrete thermal expansion behaviour, which is fundamental to understanding concrete high temperature structural behaviour, is first investigated. These preliminary studies provide the necessary fundamental understanding to identify the influence of gas phase temperature variation upon the membrane behaviour of reinforced concrete slabs. The individual influences of spatial and temporal variation upon slab membrane behaviour are investigated and the behaviour under non-uniform thermal variation contrasted with uniform thermal exposure behaviour. The influence of spatial variation of temperature is found to be strongly dependent upon the structural slenderness ratio. The tensile membrane action of slender slabs is particularly susceptible to the distorted slab deflection profiles induced by spatial variation of gas temperature. Conversely the compressive membrane behaviour of stocky slabs is found to be insensitive to the deformation effects induced by spatial variation of temperature. The influence upon slender slabs is demonstrated under a range of temporal variations indicating that the thermal response of concrete is sufficiently fast to be sensitive to realistically varying distributions of temperature. Contrasting behaviour induced by uniform and non-uniform thermal exposures indicates that uniform temperature assumptions provide both conservative and unconservative predictions of behaviour. The accuracy of the uniform temperature assumptions was also found to be dependent upon the type of fire, for example, fast hot and short cool fires. Additionally, the sensitivity of structural performance to deformations caused by spatial variation of temperature demonstrated in this thesis challenges the purely strength based focus of traditional <b>structural</b> fire engineering. <b>Spalling</b> is an important feature of concrete’s high temperature behaviour which is not currently explicitly addressed in design. The incorporation of <b>spalling</b> into <b>structural</b> analysis is not, however, straightforward. The influence of spalling upon behaviour has therefore been dealt with separately. A spalling design framework is developed to incorporate the effects of <b>spalling</b> into a <b>structural</b> analysis. Application of the framework to case studies demonstrates the potential for spalling to critically undermine the structural performance of concrete in fire. It also demonstrates how the framework can be used to quantify the effects of spalling and therefore account for these in the structural fire design addressing spalling risk in a rational manner.
