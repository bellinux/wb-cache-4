They rode on the outside of the <b>selector</b> <b>sleeve,</b> not on the shaft itself. The output shaft of the gearbox had all five gears splined to it and in constant mesh with the other gears. On the outside of the <b>selector</b> <b>sleeve</b> was a ring of dogs, which could engage one gear at a time as the sleeve was slid {{back and forth}} through the gear cluster. The faces of these dogs were not flush, but were slightly offset, so that they engaged one by one.|$|E

It {{is assumed that}} all bodies of the system can rotate completely {{independently of one another}} and perform rotational motion about the same axis under the action of external and internal loads. The direct dynamics synchronization problem for the contacting triple-body system is stated and the algorithm of the solution of the problem is presented. To determine the synchronization time the transcendental equation is derived. The torques between contacting interfaces are determined by solving two integral equations. Finally, by knowing synchronization time and the torques between contacting interfaces, the rotational motion of the system during synchronization process is determined by integration of the governing equations with prescribed initial conditions. It was shown that the solution of the direct dynamics problem is not unique and the synchronizing torques can be subject to optimization. The obtained results are applied for a generic synchronizer mechanism of manual transmission systems. Assuming that the drag torque, the vehicle resistance torque, the control torque applied to the <b>selector</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and the synchronizing torques at the contacting interfaces are substantially constant during synchronization the solution of the direct dynamics synchronization problem for a generic synchronizer is obtained in analytical form.

40|$|Manual {{transmissions}} {{for passenger}} {{cars and trucks}} are equipped with synchronizer mechanisms. A synchronizer mechanism as {{a key component of}} a transmission system must be able to prevent transmission gears from shocking, reduce the noise and it has a great impact on driving comfort and transmission efficiency. Gear shifting improvement with respect to smooth, quick and energy efficient synchronizerâ€™s performance is still an important issue for automotive industry. A synchronization process comprises several phases within which presynchronization, main synchronization, pre-engagement and engagement phases can be recognized. Aiming an understanding of internal dynamics and existing possibilities for optimization of synchronization processes in transmission systems during the main synchronization phase an engineering model of a generic synchronizer mechanism is proposed. The synchronizer mechanism is modeled by a contacting triple-body system consisting of the <b>selector</b> <b>sleeve,</b> the blocker ring and the gearwheel. The algorithm has developed to solve the direct dynamics synchronization problem for the generic synchronizer mechanism. By using the developed algorithm the rotational motion of the contacting triple-body system and the synchronizing torques between contacting interfaces are determined for given vehicle resistance torque, the drag torque, and the control torque applied to the <b>selector</b> <b>sleeve</b> that all together satisfy the equations of motion and guarantee synchronization of the rotational speeds of the sleeve, the blocker ring and the gearwheel for the final time. It is shown that the solution to the direct dynamics synchronization problem for the generic synchronizer mechanism is not unique and it allows formulation different optimization problems. Mathematical statement of multi-objective Pareto optimal control problem for synchronizer mechanism is given. Within the proposed model of the generic synchronizer mechanism the time-comfort Pareto optimal control problem is considered. Assuming that the resistance torque on the synchronizer owing to the vehicle inertia, the drag torque, and the synchronizing torques at the contacting interfaces are substantially constant during the main phase of a synchronization process, the solution to the time-comfort Pareto optimal control problem has been obtained. It was shown that there exist the external control torque (or shift force) applied to the <b>selector</b> <b>sleeve</b> such that the synchronization of rotational speeds of the sleeve, the blocker ring and the gearwheel is guaranteed and the synchronization process is optimal both with respect to minimal possible synchronization time as well as lowest possible inertial load acting on the synchronizer mechanism. Analysis of the obtained Pareto solution is presented...|$|E
2500|$|As in the divided-multiple {{telephone}} switchboard arrangements {{with which it}} served until it replaced them, the panel system consisted of an originating section and a terminating section, connected by a line circuit. A subscriber's line had two appearances in a local office, one on the originating side, {{and one on the}} terminating side. The line circuit consisted of a line relay on the originating side to indicate that a customer had gone off-hook, and a cutoff relay to keep the line relay from interfering with an established connection. [...] The cutoff relay was controlled by a sleeve lead that, as with the multiple switchboard, could be activated by either the incoming section or the outgoing. [...] The final <b>selector</b> performed a <b>sleeve</b> test to detect a busy line when a subscriber was called.|$|R
40|$|An {{engineering}} {{model of a}} generic synchronizer is considered. The generic synchronizer is modeled consisting of the <b>selector</b> <b>sleeve</b> with engaging teeth and frictional cone, the synchronizing ring with blocker and the gearwheel with engaging teeth. It is assumed that for the sleeve and synchronizing ring translational and rotational motions are feasible, for the gearwheel only rotational motion is feasible. The motion of the generic synchronizer is performed under the external and internal loads. The external loads comprise the vehicle resistance torque and the control force applied to the sleeve and the drag torque due to the clutch. The internal loads comprise the forces and torques arises due to interaction between the sleeve, the synchronizing ring, the gearwheel as well as oil splash during the synchronization process. A feasible synchronization process of a generic synchronizer is divided into four main phases: pre-synchronization, main synchronization, blocker transition (indexing for the ring), and engagement. Pre-synchronization and blocker transition are further divided into several sub-phases. The generic synchronizer is fully parametrized and together with description of all phases constitutes kinematics of synchronization process in question. Due {{to the nature of}} synchronization process in transmission system a motion of a synchronizer mechanism is subjected to unilateral or/and bilateral constraints imposed on generalized coordinates or/and generalized velocities of the synchronizer. Constrained Lagrangian Formalism (CLF) has been proposed as an approach for developing mathematical and computational models of a generic synchronizer dynamics. The CLF gives possibility to formulate direct dynamics, semi-inverse dynamics and inverse dynamics problems for a generic synchronizer in unified and efficient way. It is shown that CLF can be promising and useful for advanced dynamic analysis of the existing synchronizer mechanisms and to design novel optimized ones. In the present report mathematical and computational models of a generic synchronizer with five degrees of freedom have been developed using CLF. Application of CLF on the modelling of the synchronization process gives system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE). Analysis of the generic synchronizer performance diagrams has shown that the CLF based model is able to predict the synchronization process characteristics reasonably well. The developed model has been validated by using measurement data from test rig at CV AB Scania. Performance of the generic synchronizer is also analyzed in case of driveline vibrations. Sensitivity analysis of the synchronizer mechanism performance with respect to cone angle, coefficient of friction, maximum value of shift force and rate of applying shift force has been done. Next, the developed models will be used to get further insight into synchronizer design and its performance diagrams with aid of global sensitivity analysis and Pareto optimization...|$|E
