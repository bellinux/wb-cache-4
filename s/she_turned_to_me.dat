500|$|His wife, {{a native}} of the former Soviet Union who had no {{memories}} or expectations like his, saw things with fresh eyes. [...] "She's a nurse and goes between floors at hospitals. At one point <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at some princess fair or something and said, 'This is worse than working the psych [...] at the hospital.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Havins and Riegel {{described}} what went into taping the moment Bianca discovers that her child {{is alive and}} Babe's deception. [...] "It was crazy!" [...] said Riegel of the [...] "grueling" [...] day. [...] "It was insane, in fact. [...] and I were on the set from 9 a.m. to like 7:30 at night, {{just the two of}} us." [...] Havins agreed and relayed, [...] "It was so intense to tape. It was a long, long day, a 12-hour tape day." [...] They were warned by All My Children executives that the episode would be [...] "especially" [...] demanding. [...] "I don't think they've ever handed that much material to just two actresses before, so they wanted us to be prepared," [...] said Riegel. [...] "It was the most dialogue I've ever had in my entire life. To the point where several weeks before they gave me the script, our producer, Julie , sat us down and said to us, 'This is just so important.,'" [...] added Havins. [...] "And <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'We're almost nervous because it's so much material. If it's too much, let us know.' It was that dialogue-heavy." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> impulsively. Her {{face had}} lost its hard look.|$|E
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> find <b>me</b> {{beside her}} in misfortune.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>to</b> <b>me</b> anxiously. I suppose I {{was very}} flushed with {{excitement}} and surprise.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> obey <b>me</b> like {{a little}} child, and the next I knew of it had stopped in the very doorway.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> with {{an abrupt}} {{recovery}} of her customary manner.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with a swift movement, {{her eyes}} filled with tears.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with a {{very bright}} smile and gave me her hand.|$|E
60|$|After the {{compliments}} on both sides, my landlord, as I {{now call}} him, told her very handsomely what a benefactor I {{had been to}} her family, by redeeming him {{from the hands of}} villains; and <b>she,</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> thanked me in the most obliging manner, and with a modest graceful way of speech, such as I cannot describe, and which indeed I did not think the Spaniards, who are said to be so haughty, had been acquainted with.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Georgina was {{the first}} to break the silence. 'After all, my dear,' <b>she</b> murmured, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'there was a deal of sound English {{common-sense}} about Dogberry!' ...|$|R
60|$|When the saleswoman {{named the}} amount the {{disappointed}} girl began heroically {{to remove the}} jacket. As she laid it aside <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> instinctively <b>to</b> <b>me</b> for sympathy.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bundercombe {{stared at}} him. She said nothing; {{expression}} was sufficient. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|At that <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> another mood coming like {{a gust of}} wind on the Chesapeake.|$|E
60|$|We {{stood there}} in silence for several long minutes. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with a little sigh.|$|E
40|$|The beige phone, greasy {{from being}} handled {{dozens of times}} each day, begins to ring. "Hello. Counseling and Student Development," I hear the student helper cheerfully say. It's {{too early in the}} morning to be cheerful. "Okay, I'll tell her. " <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> "Excuse me, Mika, " the student helper says a moment later from the {{cluttered}} receptionist's table. Thoughts broken, I look at the darkly tanned girl with artificially highlighted hair. "That was Kyle. He's running a little late, but he'll be here in a few minutes. ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} James More, who nodded, and at that, like a trained soldier, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> go with <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The girl {{wrenched}} at the handle, and I {{noticed by}} the creaking {{of the bureau}} how strong, {{in spite of her}} slenderness, she was. The lock would not yield, and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> imperiously <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Don't waste a moment, but smash that drawer in!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Perhaps {{something}} in my face had spoken the sympathy which I could not wholly suppress.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as though}} in protest, but my face gave her no encouragement. She rose wearily to her feet.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with {{a little}} smile of apology. There was a new look in her face too. She spoke gravely.|$|E
60|$|They {{were glad}} enough to slink {{off into the}} {{darkness}} before those scornful eyes. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> once more <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> then <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{and began}} {{explaining}} {{the circumstances under}} which she had discovered her loss. I suggested that the missing things should be well searched for first, and then, if nothing came of that, that I should go for the constable, and place the matter under his direction.|$|R
6000|$|The {{facts in}} the {{following}} case came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> by letter from a young lady {{who lives in the}} beautiful city of San Jos√©; she is perfectly unknown <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and simply signs herself [...] "Aurelia Maria," [...] which may possibly be a fictitious name. But no matter, the poor girl is almost heartbroken by the misfortunes she has undergone, and so confused by the conflicting counsels of misguided friends and insidious enemies that she does not know what course to pursue in order to extricate herself from the web of difficulties in which she seems almost hopelessly involved. In this dilemma <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> for help, and supplicates for my guidance and instruction with a moving eloquence that would touch the heart of a statue. Hear her sad story: ...|$|R
60|$|Laura {{was near}} enough to hear the last word, softly as he whispered it. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{with a look of}} terror.|$|E
60|$|When he {{had gone}} off Aunt Julia sat {{perfectly}} still for a long time, and then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Her eyes shone queerly.|$|E
60|$|She was {{standing}} stock {{still staring at}} the pastry she was making. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{and there was a}} curious smile about her lips.|$|E
60|$|I {{kissed her}} cheek as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I think I {{would have gone}} through {{a great deal to}} kiss her cheek. But I felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and that it was worth nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is perhaps}} best to explain {{everything}} to him before we start. I {{was about to tell}} you, Mr. Ritchie," [...] <b>she</b> continued, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "that Auguste has given no hint in his note of Mr. Temple's presence in Louisiana. And yet you told me that they were to have come here together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must {{let me know}} you, {{and know}} you well," [...] said she. [...] "Your uncle and aunt are quite old acquaintances of mine, and though you cannot {{remember}} me, I have held you in my arms when you were an infant.

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{and gave}} me her hand. I kissed it in silence. [...] "You may go on," [...] she said, facing the Sergeant again as {{steadily}} as ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no. Not {{the least}} occasion." [...] <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "I suppose {{you are too}} tired to go out again, after your walk on the hills?" [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "She made no answer, but {{walked to}} the fireplace, dropped the letter in a bed of writhing blue flame and watched it burn to white ashes. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I declare," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{her eyes}} glistening with tears of merriment, [...] "this is {{the funniest thing}} I ever saw. Why, you have {{actually}} separated those poor lovers for life, and crushed every hope in the properest way. And then all the rest about commerce! I wouldn't have believed you could do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|The instant <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> thank <b>me,</b> I stood {{rooted to}} the spot. There was the {{original}} of the photographic portrait in the dressing-case! there was my husband's mother, standing face <b>to</b> face with <b>me!</b> I recognized the quaint little gray curls, the gentle, genial expression, the mole {{at the corner of}} the mouth. No mistake was possible. His mother herself! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why quarrel at all?" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Mr. Ducaine," [...] <b>she</b> added, <b>turning</b> coolly <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "I {{trust you}} have {{remembered that the}} Prince is my father's guest." ...|$|R
