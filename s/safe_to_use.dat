The frequency of this adverse effect was under 1% and not significantly higher than found with placebo. A review of the available data carried out in 2008 indicated that bupropion is <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> in people {{with a variety of}} serious cardiac conditions.|$|E
5|$|Commanded by Captain Roderick Dew, {{the ship}} was {{initially}} assigned to the Channel Fleet where she spent three months as temporary flagship before she {{was transferred to the}} Mediterranean in 1868. Lord Clyde made one cruise with the Mediterranean Fleet during which she fractured her steel mainyard in a squall. Her engines continued to deteriorate and they were condemned as no longer <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> by the fleet engineer when she arrived in Naples. The ship was sent to the Malta Dockyard under sail for repair, but they could only make temporary repairs that would enable her to reach home.|$|E

The “Environmental Meister Programme” certification focuses on environment and health, but not on a specific field of production, which is quite unique. This system guarantees that certain products are <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tetracyclines are teratogens {{due to the}} {{likelihood}} of causing teeth discolouration in the fetus as they develop in infancy. For this same reason, tetracyclines are contraindicated for use in children under 8 years of age. Some adults also experience teeth discoloration (mild grey hue) after use. They are, however, <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> in the first 18 weeks of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone {{has been}} {{prescribed}} {{and used in}} over 10million pregnancies worldwide. There have been no harmful effects exhibited due {{to the use of}} dydrogesterone while pregnant. Dydrogesterone is <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> during pregnancy only when prescribed and indicated by a medical practitioner. Studies have not shown any incidence of decreased fertility due to dydrogesterone at therapeutic dose. The Ames test found no evidence of any potential mutagenic or toxicity properties.|$|E

25|$|After the {{insulation}} period, the soap is firm {{enough to be}} removed from the mold and cut into bars. At this time, it is <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the soap, since saponification is in essence complete. However, cold-process soaps are typically cured and hardened on a drying rack for 2–6 weeks before use. During this cure period, trace amounts of residual lye are consumed by saponification and excess water evaporates.|$|E
25|$|Even in {{the cold}} soap making process, some heat is usually required; the {{temperature}} is usually raised to a point sufficient to ensure complete melting of the fat being used. The batch may also be kept warm for some time after mixing to ensure the alkali (hydroxide) is completely used up. This soap is <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> after about 12–48 hours, but is not at its peak quality for use for several weeks.|$|E
25|$|A Royal New Zealand Air Force C-130 Hercules plane brought 42 urban {{search and}} rescue {{personnel}} and three sniffer dogs from the North Island to Christchurch {{the day of the}} quake, to help check for people buried in the rubble and determine which buildings are <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> There were a large number of police and engineers present in the disaster areas. The New Zealand Army deployed personnel upon the request of the Christchurch mayor. Eighty police officers from Auckland were dispatched to Christchurch to assist with general duties there.|$|E

50|$|However, with {{non-locking}} carabiner it is <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{the knot}} with carabiner gate opening facing down (opposite {{to what is}} shown in the picture). This decreases the risk of self-unclipping: at maximum, one twist goes off. Otherwise, the whole knot may fail.|$|R
25|$|The whip {{usually has}} a stock of 6 feet (1.8 m), with a lash of 56 feet (1.51.8 m) (although some are longer). The whip is light, easy to handle, and well balanced. It is not <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a riding or driving whip for longeing {{because they are}} too short to reach the horse without {{bringing}} the handler {{close enough to the}} horse's hindquarters to risk being kicked by the horse. The longe whip is used as an encouragement to the horse but never as a punishment.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} {{controversy over the}} earliest age at which it is clinically, morally, and legally <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> GnRH analogues, and for how long. The sixth edition of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health's Standards of Care permit it from Tanner stage 2 but do not allow the addition of hormones until age 16, which could be five or more years later. Sex steroids have important functions {{in addition to their}} role in puberty, and some skeletal changes (such as increased height) that may be considered masculine are not hindered by GnRH analogues.|$|E
25|$|Immunocontraception {{is one of}} the few {{alternatives}} to lethal methods for the direct control of wildlife populations. While there was research into the use of hormonal contraception for wildlife control as early as the 1950s that produced pharmacologically effective products, they all proved to be ineffective for wildlife control for a variety of practical reasons. Field trials of immunocontraception in wildlife, on the other hand, established that contraceptive vaccines could be delivered remotely by capture gun, were <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> in pregnant animals, were reversible, and induced long-lasting infertility, overcoming these practical limitations.|$|E
50|$|Baculovirus is {{normally}} used for production of glycoproteins, although the glycosylations {{may be different}} from those found in vertebrates. In general, it is <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> than mammalian virus as it has a limited host range and does not infect vertebrates without modifications.|$|R
50|$|AIBN is <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> than benzoyl {{peroxide}} (another radical initiator) because {{the risk of}} explosion is far less. However, it is still considered as an explosive compound, decomposing above 65 °C. A respirator dust mask, protective gloves and safety glasses are recommended.|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} Chavacano {{speakers}} (especially older Caviteño or Zamboangueño speakers) who {{would tend to}} say 'mana' for 'maga'. 'Mana' is accepted and quite common, especially among older speakers, but when in doubt, the modifier 'maga' to pluralize nouns is <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b>|$|R
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{abdominal}} cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. More {{serious side effects}} may include Clostridium difficile colitis, liver problems, prolonged QT, and allergic reactions. It is generally safe in those who are allergic to penicillin. Erythromycin {{also appears to be}} <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> during pregnancy. While generally regarded as safe during breastfeeding its use by the mother during {{the first two weeks of}} life may increase the risk of pyloric stenosis in the baby. This risk also applies if taken directly by the baby during this age. It is in the macrolide family and works by decreasing bacterial protein production.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} with {{intravenous}} use include sleepiness, muscle twitching, confusion, changes in vision, numbness, tingling, and vomiting. It can cause low {{blood pressure and}} an irregular heart rate. There are concerns that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. It appears to be generally safe for use in pregnancy. A lower dose may be required in those with liver problems. It is generally <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> in those allergic to tetracaine or benzocaine. Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic medication of the class Ib type. Lidocaine works by blocking sodium channels and thus decreasing the rate of contractions of the heart. When used locally as a numbing agent, local neurons cannot signal the brain.|$|E
25|$|During normal use, a UDDT {{is just as}} {{hygienic}} and <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> as {{any other}} type of toilet. However, health aspects need to be considered during removal and emptying of the urine and feces containers of a UDDT. These health risks during emptying of the feces vault or container are significantly lower when compared to emptying the pit of pit latrines or the buckets of some types of dry toilets without urine diversion. However, the health risks are somewhat higher when compared to a flush toilet where the user does not have to carry out any emptying or maintenance tasks at the household level unless the flush toilet plugs, back-flows or otherwise experiences operating problems.|$|E
25|$|Being {{much smaller}} than a normal table saw, they are {{substantially}} <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> when cutting very small pieces.

50|$|BCl3 is an {{aggressive}} reagent that can form hydrogen chloride upon exposure to moisture or alcohols. The dimethyl sulfide adduct (BCl3SMe2), {{which is a}} solid, is much <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> when possible, but H2O will destroy the BCl3 portion while leaving dimethyl sulfide in solution.|$|R
25|$|Antifreeze {{products}} for automotive use containing propylene glycol {{in place of}} ethylene glycol are available. They are generally considered <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> as propylene glycol does not taste as good and is converted in the body to lactic acid, a normal product of metabolism and exercise.|$|R
