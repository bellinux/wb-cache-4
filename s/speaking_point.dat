60|$|Captain Wilson, {{hot with}} the {{combined}} effects {{of exercise and}} wrath, continued the pursuit, but the pause to say sweet nothings to the second in command was fatal to his success. He had often before had occasion to comment ruefully upon {{the pace of the}} quarry, and especially at such times when he felt that he had strung his courage almost up to <b>speaking</b> <b>point.</b> To-day he was {{just in time to see}} her vanish into the front garden of a small house, upon the door of which she knocked with expressive vigor. She disappeared into the house just as he reached the gate.|$|E
60|$|And here {{it has to}} be {{told that}} {{although}} Trafford knew that Marjorie had been spending too much money, he still had no idea of just how much money she had spent. She was doing her utmost to come to an understanding with him, and at the same time--I don't explain it, I don't excuse it--she was keeping back her bills from him, keeping back urgent second and third and fourth demands, that she had no cheque-book now to stave off even by the most partial satisfaction. It kept her awake at nights, that catastrophic explanation, that all unsuspected by Trafford hung over their attempts at mutual elucidation; it kept her awake but she could not bring it to the <b>speaking</b> <b>point,</b> and she clung, in spite of her own intelligence, to a persuasion that after they had got something really settled and defined then it would be time enough to broach the particulars of this second divergence....|$|E

40|$|As an {{important}} step and technical nodus of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image applications, image match is {{an important}} {{process in which the}} corresponding relations of pixel points between many SAR images can be got. Usually, the accuracy of image match directly affects the next operations of SAR images. Nowadays, image match methods can be mainly divided into two kinds: one is based on region and the other one on characteristic. The former usually uses normalization cross-correlation as a matching measure, so these methods aren’t good enough to meet the requirements of SAR images or multisensor image match. And the latter mainly uses common characteristics from two images to make image match. Generally <b>speaking,</b> <b>point</b> characteristics are affected by noises much more. Given the coherent speckle noises of SAR images, it is better to make image match using edge or outline characteristics. Considering these problems, a new match method and flow of SAR image pairs based on edge detection and “virtual epipolar ” are proposed and researched in this paper. First of all, a new edge detector, combined by Canny operator and Ratio operator, is used to generate edge information. In order to improve the matching speed and quantitatively analyze the results, some edge points with more obvious characteristics are obtained by Moravec operator which can be regarded as a base points set. Next, in order to find the corresponding points faster, a search strategy based on “virtual epipolar ” is proposed and established. In the third step, using edge information combined with gray-level information of the image as the matching measure, the corresponding points are searched along the “virtual epipolar ” line. To get rid of the wrong corresponding points, a quadratic polynomial method is used. At last, experiments have been conducted on airborne SAR image pairs with 1 m resolution in Chengdu, China. As a result, the match method based on edge detection and “virtual epipolar ” line studied in this paper is feasible, and the matching accuracy and velocity have improved much more than some other methods. 1...|$|E

Mr. Clifford was a good shot, and shaken though he was, at this supreme moment his skill did not fail him. The man was struck somewhere, for he staggered about and fell; then slowly picked himself up, and began to hobble back towards his companions, who, when they met him, stopped a minute {{to give him some}} kind of assistance.|$|R
