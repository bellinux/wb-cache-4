5|$|Carriage and {{shipment}} of {{some kinds of}} lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when <b>short-circuited,</b> leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway. Most consumer lithium batteries have built-in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident, or are otherwise designed to limit short-circuit currents. Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.|$|E
5|$|The comb-line filter {{is similar}} to the {{interdigital}} filter in that it lends itself to mechanical assembly in a metal case without dielectric support. In the case of the comb-line, all the lines are <b>short-circuited</b> at the same end rather than alternate ends. The other ends are terminated in capacitors to ground, and the design is consequently classified as semi-lumped. The chief advantage of this design is that the upper stopband can be made very wide, that is, free of spurious passbands at all frequencies of interest.|$|E
5|$|Interdigital {{filters are}} {{another form of}} coupled-line filter. Each section of line is about λ/4 in length and is {{terminated}} in a short-circuit at one end only, the other end being left open-circuit. The end which is <b>short-circuited</b> alternates on each line section. This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies, but also particularly lends itself to a mechanical assembly of lines fixed inside a metal case. The lines can be either circular rods or rectangular bars, and interfacing to a coaxial format line is easy. As with the parallel-coupled line filter, {{the advantage of a}} mechanical arrangement that does not require insulators for support is that dielectric losses are eliminated. The spacing requirement between lines is not as stringent as in the parallel line structure; as such, higher fractional bandwidths can be achieved, and Q values as low as 1.4 are possible.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} <b>short-circuit</b> oscillations {{in power}} lines. <b>Short-circuit</b> currents generate electromagnetic {{forces on the}} conductors, exciting <b>short-circuit</b> oscillations. Since the <b>short-circuit</b> periods are very short, the <b>short-circuit</b> forces in single conductor overhead lines are usually low {{because of the large}} phase spacing. However these forces may have considerable impact on distribution lines due to the change in phase spacing during <b>short-circuit</b> occurrences. For bundle conductor lines, the <b>short-circuit</b> forces between subconductors are significantly higher due to the small distance between them. Methods for estimating the compressive forces on bundle conductor spacers or spacer dampers are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This work {{consists}} of two major parts - theoretical and practical. The theoretical part describes the course of <b>short-circuit</b> current in time, its components, characteristic values, and various types of <b>short-circuits</b> that may occur in electrification network. The theoretical part also describes the method of symmetrical components, its principles, fundamental relations and its use for handling the <b>short-circuit</b> current in electrification network, especially the asymmetrical <b>short-circuits.</b> The last theoretical section following the method of symmetrical components shows a summary of formulas used to calculate substitute <b>short-circuit</b> impedances in various elements of electrification network.

Despite this setback, the Christmas Candle was widely considered a success, and the Easton Area Christmas Committee signed a charter on December 17, 1951, tasking itself with organizing a yearly holiday program revolving around the Christmas Candle. The candle was assembled again every Christmas season until 1961, with ceremonies generally including holiday decorations, Christmas carols, refreshments, appearances by Santa Claus and other forms of entertainment. The Easton Area Christmas Committee was responsible for raising the funds and encouraging the civic interest necessary to keep the program active.|$|E
5|$|Some common {{structures}} {{are shown in}} figures 3 and 4, along with their lumped-element counterparts. These lumped-element approximations {{are not to be}} taken as equivalent circuits but rather as a guide to the behaviour of the distributed elements over a certain frequency range. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show a short-circuit and open-circuit stub, respectively. When the stub length is λ/4, these behave, respectively, as anti-resonators and resonators and are therefore useful, respectively, as elements in band-pass and band-stop filters. Figure 3(c) shows a <b>short-circuited</b> line coupled to the main line. This also behaves as a resonator, but is commonly used in low-pass filter applications with the resonant frequency well outside the band of interest. Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show coupled line structures which are both useful in band-pass filters. The structures of figures 3(c) and 3(e) have equivalent circuits involving stubs placed in series with the line. Such a topology is straightforward to implement in open-wire circuits but not with a planar technology. These two {{structures are}} therefore useful for implementing an equivalent series element.|$|E
25|$|The {{rectification}} {{action is}} due to a thin coating of aluminum hydroxide on the aluminum electrode, formed by first applying a strong current to the cell to build up the coating. The rectification process is temperature-sensitive, and for best efficiency should not operate above 86°F (30°C). There is also a breakdown voltage where the coating is penetrated and the cell is <b>short-circuited.</b> Electrochemical methods are often more fragile than mechanical methods, and can be sensitive to usage variations, which can drastically change or completely disrupt the rectification processes.|$|E

25|$|The {{brushless}} wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed (BWRSDF) {{machine is}} the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology (i.e., both ports independently excited with no <b>short-circuited</b> port). The dual ported transformer circuit topology {{is known to be}} unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set. If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set, the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable. Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated.|$|E

25|$|The voltage at the {{terminals}} {{generated by}} the dielectric absorption may possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit. For sensitive analog circuits such as sample and hold circuits, integrators, charge amplifiers or high-quality audio circuits, Class-1 ceramic or polypropylene capacitors instead of Class-2 ceramic capacitors, polyester film capacitors or electrolytic capacitors are used. For most electronic circuits, particularly filtering applications, the small dielectric absorption voltage has no influence on the proper electrical function of the circuit. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte which are not built into a circuit, the dielectric absorption voltage generated can be a personnel safety risk. The voltage can be quite substantial, for example 50V for 400V electrolytic capacitors, and can cause damages to semiconductor devices, or cause sparks during installation in the circuit. Larger aluminum electrolytic capacitors and high-voltage power capacitors are transported and delivered <b>short-circuited</b> to dissipate this unwanted and possibly dangerous energy.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} several notable power outages in Auckland. The five-week-long 1998 Auckland power crisis blacked out much of the CBD after a cascade failure {{occurred}} on four underground cables in Mercury Energy's sub-transmission network. The 2006 Auckland Blackout interrupted supply to the CBD and many inner suburbs after an earth wire shackle at Transpower's Otahuhu substation broke and <b>short-circuited</b> the lines supplying the inner city. In 2009, much of the northern and western suburbs, {{as well as all}} of Northland, experienced a blackout when a forklift accidentally came into contact with the Otahuhu to Henderson 220kV line, the only major line supplying the region. Transpower spent $1.25billion in the early 2010s reinforcing the supply into and across Auckland, including a 400kV-capable transmission line from the Waikato River to Brownhill substation (operated at 220kV initially), and 220kV underground cables between Brownhill and Pakuranga, and between Pakuranga and Albany via the CBD. These reduced the Auckland Region's reliance on Otahuhu substation and northern and western Auckland's reliance on the Otahuhu to Henderson line.|$|E
25|$|A major {{controversy}} over the August 4 agreement erupted the day after it was signed. An African American sheet metal worker, Gilbert Foster, began work, which led to rumors that white workers would strike in protest. Despite an emergency meeting by federal and city officials with leaders of Sheet Metal Workers Local 65, 14 white sheet metal workers walked off the job on August 6. The workers argued that Foster was not a union-accredited sheet metal worker, and that union rules required him to work for at least seven days to prove his skills. Paul Ristau, business agent for Local 65, agreed that Foster had not yet become a union member, but said his application was being processed. The UFM threatened to picket if Foster was not employed, so A. Nabakowski Co., the sheet metal contractor, offered to keep Foster {{on the job and}} pay him if he reported to work. The following day, Nabakowski paid Foster to sit in a trailer. Local 65 ordered its men back to work, and 11 of them did so (under protest) on August 7. Foster himself agreed to perform whatever non-work, makework, or sheet metal work the company wanted, which <b>short-circuited</b> the UFM's demand that he work solely on sheet metal projects.|$|E
3000|$|To {{improve the}} {{accuracy}} of fault location system, several <b>short-circuit</b> tests need [...] to be conducted before being brought into service in autotransformer (AT) feeding systems for high-speed railways in China. However, no systematic algorithm yet exists to evaluate {{the consistency of the}} current distribution of <b>short-circuit</b> tests. A methodology is proposed in this paper to address this problem. Based on Kirchhoff’s current law and the generalized method of symmetrical components, the current deviations of the AT feeding systems are analysed and then normalized with the <b>short-circuit</b> current as they vary greatly with systems and <b>short-circuit</b> sites. It is also found that the <b>short-circuit</b> current varies with the calculation methods, and its unbiased standard deviation also reflects the consistency of the <b>short-circuit</b> test. The mean and maximum of the current deviations, as well as the unbiased standard deviation of the <b>short-circuit</b> current, show the consistency of the <b>short-circuit</b> test from different aspects, although the last two items are highly relevant. Therefore, a unified evaluation index is defined as the sum of the three items, and then applied in two case studies to test its performance. The results show that, the proposed index can clearly distinguish the consistency of the <b>short-circuit</b> tests and may be used to sort the <b>short-circuit</b> tests for fault location systems. Besides, some <b>short-circuit</b> tests may have very poor consistency indices, and thus are not applicable to the tuning of fault location systems. In the authors’ opinion, the determination of the threshold of the proposed index needs further investigation.|$|R
