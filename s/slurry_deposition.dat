40|$|The {{behaviour}} of cohesionless soils {{is known}} to be influenced by the method of reconstitution. It is generally accepted in the literature that different reconstitution methods produce samples of varying fabric and thus samples of varying behaviour. Very little evidence has been presented to validate this statement. The main aim of this is thesis is firstly to observe the fabric of in situ and reconstituted gold tailings samples and secondly to investigate the difference in behaviour between these samples at the same state. The investigation focused on testing in situ and reconstituted gold tailings samples obtained from 3 positions on a tailings dam; pond, middle beach and upper beach. Laboratory reconstitution methods included moist tamping and <b>slurry</b> <b>deposition.</b> Fabric analysis involved the use of SEM images to classify the observed differences in the fabric of the undisturbed and reconstituted gold tailings samples. A particle interaction model based on the observed fabric was postulated to explain the differences or similarities in behaviour. The scope of behaviour investigated included sedimentation, collapse and swell, consolidation and compressibility, creep, stiffness and shear behaviour. The fabric analysis indicates that differences in the fabric of undisturbed and reconstituted gold tailings samples are visible. Moist tamping produces an aggregated fabric while <b>slurry</b> <b>deposition</b> yields a homogeneous fabric {{similar to that of the}} undisturbed samples. Comparison of behaviour indicates that neither moist tamping nor <b>slurry</b> <b>deposition</b> can replicate the behaviour of the undisturbed sample fully. Consolidation and compression is a function of the fabric while friction angle is independent of the fabric. Available shear strength and liquifaction potential is also affected by the preparation method and the resulting fabric. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Different {{specimen}} {{preparation methods}} such as moist tamping, dry funnel deposition, <b>slurry</b> <b>deposition,</b> dry air pluviation {{have been reported in}} the literature to investigate the undrained behavior of silty sands. Similarly, different means have been used to densify the soils prepared with such methods. However, the influence of the densification technique, utilized within a particular deposition method, on undrained behavior (e. g. change in initial peak deviator stress and instability angle) was not known. Therefore, a new densification technique is developed for the dry funnel deposition method, which avoids tamping, vibrating or mold tapping. This new method of densification is thought to create a much consistent soil fabric for different amounts of densification than other specimen densification techniques. The experimental results show that the change in undrained behavior with increasing density produced by densification is much less pronounced when compared to the other densification methods reported in the literature. Prior research efforts regarding the effect of non plastic silts on the liquefaction behavior of sands mainly focused on the influence of fines content, confining stress, and depositional techniques. However, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the influence of fines content on the undrained behavior of silty sands. Strain-controlled monotonic undrained triaxial compression tests were performed on a single base sand mixed with three different essentially nonplastic silts.

40|$|Industrial {{settling}} slurries often {{consist of}} particles of very different sizes; the {{particle size distribution}} may cover sizes which differ with two orders of magnitude. A broad particle size distribution affects parameters of <b>slurry</b> flow including <b>deposition</b> limit velocity. We present experimental results of the deposition limit velocity collected during a comprehensive experimental campaign testing slurry flows composed of solids of different fractions in the GIW Hydraulic Laboratory in 2016. Four narrow graded fractions (carrier fluid, pseudo-homogeneous, heterogeneous, and stratified) were tested in permutations from the individual components to the complete mixture at various concentrations. The primary experiments were carried out in a 203 -mm pipe, and selected corresponding experiments were repeated in a 103 -mm pipe. The experimental results show that interactions among components affect the resulting deposition limit velocity in flows of broadly graded settling slurries. The effect of particle size distribution on the deposition limit velocity is not benign.

40|$|In {{dredging}} works, fines are {{encountered in}} different ways. Fines {{can be produced}} during the cutting of rocks or {{can be found in}} natural deposited sand. The presence of fines in sand soil is generally recognized as problem in geotechnical engineering. It is believed that fines in a sand increases soil compressibility and tendency to creep. Also it is often assumed that the strength, stiffness, hydraulic conductivity and liquefaction potential of a soil increases with increasing fines content. Therefore, during tender phase of reclamation works, it is always recommended that the soil should contain minimum amount of fines 10 % of fines. It has been recognized that the availability of soils which have small amount of 10 % of fines is very rare. In most of projects soil with maximum amount of fines above 10 % are encountered. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the mechanical behavior of sand soil with different amount of fines. The main interest is on the compressibility of sandy soils. The compressibility of sandy soil is investigated and their results are shown. A series of oedometer test for saturated silt sand mixtures is presented. During testing the following material were used River Maas sand and crushed sand, artificial silt (crushed quartz) and Belgium silt. The mixture were created by mixing River Maas sand and crushed sand with either artificial silt or Belgium silt as percentage of dry mass. Sand silt mixtures with fines contents of 7 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, 30 %, and 50 %. The samples were prepared in different initial relative densities using <b>slurry</b> <b>deposition</b> methods. In oedometer the mixtures were loaded in interval of 3. 5, 6. 9, 13. 9, 34. 6, 69. 8, 138. 5, 277. 1, 554. 2 and 1108. 3 kPa. Result shows that, the coefficient of consolidation of sand silt mixture increases with fines content from 7 % and reaches the peak value at 15 % then the coefficient of consolidation decreases with increase of fines contents. The compression index of silt sand mixtures decreases with increase on fines contents from 7 % to 30 % and then increases with increase of fines contents. The value of compression index for fines contents of 15 to 30 % is low due to its highest packing density. The secondary compression on artificial silt sand mixture is very low it is between 0. 001 - 0. 004 but for Belgium silt sand the secondary compression is significantly higher. The difference in secondary compression is due to their difference in mineralogical composition and grain size and shape. It can be conclude that the presence of fines on sand does not increase the compression and secondary compression of the sand but it is improving it. Therefore for mixtures with fines content above 10 % between 15 to 35 % are useful for reclamation activities because of their low primary compression and low secondary compression.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the behaviour of newly deposited soil is important because of its direct applications in fields such as harbour siltation and storage of dredge slurries. In coastal regions the dominant mode for deposition of fine-grained cohesive material is through flocculation- the electrostatic aggregation of mud particles. The present study focuses on the measurement of both flocculation conditions and bed properties, towards the {{understanding of}} the influence of the former on the latter. A computerised laboratory setup, complete from sedimentation and flocculation to the long term consolidation allows each of these processes to be observed in instrumented perspex columns without the many variables present in an estuary. The bed deposition rates resemble those found in natural estuaries, and therefore this technique is a much improved method for examining natural processes than the method of <b>slurry</b> <b>deposition,</b> which is normally employed in soil mechanics. An image acquisition and analysis system has been designed specifically for this work. Image sequences are analysed in real time to give information about the dimensions and concentration of the particles, and the particle velocities. Floc sizes increase as the particle concentration increases in the column. Increasing the concentration further leads to an overall hindering of the sedimentation rate and breakup of the flocs. Images of beds formed through slow sedimentation clearly show aggregate features that are not present in slurry experiments. From low to medium sedimentation rates the bed height, normalised by the mass of sediment in the bed, increases. From medium to high rates of sedimentation, however, the normalised bed heights decrease. Overall slurry experiments have lower bed heights than slowly deposited experiments. Image analysis of the bed surface (top 0. 5 mm) has revealed that aggregates which are present immediately after deposition are broken down over tens of hours. The ISIS instrument has been modified to gather information about the resistance to erosion of the beds. A bed is more easily eroded after it has had a long period of consolidation. X-ray density measurements and imaging techniques are used to link the strength of the bed to biological factors. X-ray bulk density and pore pressure measurements allow calculations of void ratio, porosity, and effective stress. Bender element apparatus has been constructed to measure shear stiffness of the soil, and bed strength measurements are made using a shear vane. It is found that variations in the sedimentation conditions have significant effects on bed density and on void ratio. These effects continue to be visible in the consolidated bed, even after an order of magnitude increase in the total vertical bed stress (equivalent to the range of metres of overburden pressure). The variations in the bed structure can have profound effects on bed strength. Methods to compare floc measurements to bed measurements are complicated by the inherent variation in floc data. Possible techniques include the use of solids volume fraction, fractal dimension and intrinsic sediment properties. The usefulness of each of these is assessed. It is suggested that it is the frequency at which the bed is bombarded by flocs, and not the properties of the flocs themselves, that largely determines the bed properties.

40|$|Liquefaction {{of sandy}} soil has been {{observed}} to cause significant damage to infrastructure during major earthquakes. Historical cases of liquefaction have typically occurred in sands containing some portion of fines particles, which are defined as 75 μm or smaller in diameter. The effects of fines on the undrained behaviour of sand are not however fully understood, and this study therefore attempts to quantify these effects through the undrained testing of sand mixed with non-plastic fines sourced from Christchurch, New Zealand. The experimental program carried out during this study consisted of undrained monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests performed on three different mixtures of sand and fines: the Fitzgerald Bridge mixture (FBM), and two Pinnacles Sand mixtures (PSM 1 and PSM 2). The fines content of each host sand was systematically varied up {{to a maximum of}} 30 %, with all test specimens being reconstituted using moist tamping deposition. The undrained test results from the FBM soils were interpreted using a range of different measures of initial state. When using void ratio and relative density, the addition of fines to the FBM sand caused more contractive behaviour for both monotonic and cyclic loadings. This resulted in lower strengths at the steady state of deformation, and lower liquefaction resistances. When the intergranular void ratio was used for the interpretation, the effect of additional fines was to cause less contractive response in the sand. The state parameter and state index were also used to interpret the undrained cyclic test results – these measures suggested that additional fines caused less contractive sand behaviour, the opposite to that observed when using the void ratio. This highlighted the dependency on the parameter chosen as a basis for the response comparison when determining the effects of fines, and pointed out a need to identify a measure that normalizes such effects. Based on the FBM undrained test results and interpretations, the equivalent granular void ratio, e*, was identified from the literature as a measure of initial state that normalizes the effects of fines on the undrained behaviour of sand up to a fines content of 30 %. This is done through a parameter within the e* definition termed the fines influence factor, b, which quantifies the effects of fines from a value of zero (no effect) to one (same effect as sand particles). The value of b was also determined to be different when interpreting the steady state lines (bSSL) and cyclic resistance curves (bCR) respectively for a given mixture of sand and fines. The steady state lines and cyclic resistance curves of the FBM soils {{and a number of other}} sand-fines mixtures sourced from the literature were subsequently interpreted using the equivalent granular void ratio concept, with bSSL and bCR values being back-calculated from the respective test data sets. Based on these interpretations, it was concluded that e* was conceptually a useful parameter for characterizing and quantifying the effects of fines on the undrained behaviour of sand, assuming the fines influence factor value could be derived. To allow prediction of the fines influence factor values, bSSL and bCR were correlated with material and depositional properties of the presented sand-fines mixtures. It was found that as the size of the fines particles relative to the sand particles became smaller, the values of bSSL and bCR reduced, indicating lower effect of fines. The same trend was also observed as the angularity of the sand particles increased. The depositional method was found to influence the value of bCR, due to the sensitivity of cyclic loading to initial soil fabric. This led to bSSL being used as a reference for the effect of fines, with specimens prepared by moist tamping having bCR > bSSL, and specimens prepared by <b>slurry</b> <b>deposition</b> having bCR < bSSL. Finally the correlations of the fines influence factor values with material and depositional properties were used to define the simplified estimation method – a procedure capable of predicting the approximate steady state lines and cyclic resistance curves of a sand as the non-plastic fines content is increased up to 30 %. The method was critically reviewed based on the undrained test results of the PSM 1 and PSM 2 soils. This review suggested the method could accurately predict undrained response curves as the fines content was raised, based on the PSM 1 test results. It also however identified some key issues with the method, such as the inability to accurately predict the responses of highly non-uniform soils, a lack of consideration for the entire particle size distribution of a soil, and the fact the errors in the prediction of bSSL carry through into the prediction of bCR. Lastly some areas of further investigation relating to the method were highlighted, including the need to verify the method through testing of sandy soils sourced from outside the Christchurch area, and the need to correlate the value of bCR with additional soil fabrics / depositional methods...|$|E

The physical characteristics for the printed cathodes were evaluated using SEM and EDS techniques to determine the morphology of the cathodes as printed. Several polymers were evaluated to identify applicability for a printed separator. In order {{to allow for the}} resulting printed separator to remain porous, an aerogel material was added to the printing <b>slurry</b> before <b>deposition.</b> The materials were evaluated for rheological properties and printing results to identify an optimal material for a printable separator. The polypropylene/polyethylene material identified as a suitable printed separator was printed directly onto printed cathodes and electrochemical and physical evaluations were conducted on the resulting battery material to determine ability to cycle and rate capability. The printed cathode and separator exhibited up to 60 mAh/g capacity. An optimal ratio between the polymer binder and the aerogel porous component was established based upon testing in a 2032 coin cell using liquid electrolytes. The ratio of binder to aerogel which exhibited the highest electrochemical performance in a full cell was predicted to have the lowest performance. This unexpected relationship was explored based upon impedance measurements of the cells. The performance of these battery components printed using the robocasting technique was compared to current alternative technologies. The resulting comparison indicates that printed battery constituents using the robocasting technique is a viable method for developing printed lithium battery systems which exhibit similar performance to alternative techniques. Additionally, the robocasting technique for battery development allows for printing of battery materials in nearly any geometry in both planar and three dimensional systems depending on the application needs.

30|$|Transportation of solids {{in form of}} {{slurries}} {{has become}} one of the most important unit operations in industries across several disciplines. In fact, the need is more pronounced in industries that are very important for human survival such as food processing, pharmaceuticals and energy (coal, oil and gas). A lot of work has been done in the past 30  years in understanding the factors affecting the deposition velocity of solids in slurries. Experimental observation and theoretical predictions pointed to mixture velocity and solid/fluid properties especially rheology of the resulting slurry to be the most important factors that dramatically affect particle motion and patterning. This paper presents a critical deposition velocity model and a “stability flow map” for complex rheology <b>slurries.</b> The critical <b>deposition</b> model utilizes a more robust generalized two-parameter rheology model to account for any given slurry rheology. The “stability flow map” demarcates the different flow patterns that may be observed at different mixture velocities and rheologies. On this map, the homogeneous slurries are predicted at low rheology and high mixture velocity, whereas heterogeneous slurries (with a concentration gradient) predicted at high rheology (yield stress effects). Sensitivity analysis was conducted on critical Reynolds number, particle density, carrier fluid density, generalized flow behavior index and pipe diameter. It was observed that increase in shear thinning behavior, particle density, pipe diameter and particle diameter led to a decrease in the laminar region and an increased unstable region. The model showed good performance when tested on glass and stainless steel beads test data available in open literature. Preliminary simulation with this map may help engineers select flowline size and carrier fluid rheology for a given type of solid particle.|$|R

40|$|Photovoltaic {{technology}} has been realized as a suitable renewable power source for the fulfillment of increasing world energy consumption with least impact on the environment. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is one such photovoltaic technology which has gained {{a great deal of}} attention due to the low manufacturing cost compared to the conventional Si-based solar cell technologies. Fabrication of DSSCs on flexible substrates enables manufacturing solar cells using cost-effective and speedy roll-to-roll processing systems and also makes the device flexible and light-weight. However, polymer-based DSSCs set restrictions to their materials and fabrication processes. In this thesis, fabrication of DSSCs on flexible polymer substrates have been extensively studied concentrating on the factors related to the <b>slurry</b> preparation, <b>deposition</b> of films and processing of electrodes to improve the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of the device. Initially, mechanically-stable, well adhered TiO 2 films based on nanocrystalline P- 25 TiO 2 slurries were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated plastic substrates using ball milling as a part of the processing stage, without the need for binders or high temperature annealing. The strength of the TiO 2 films was examined by a novel nanoscratch technique which was developed to assess inter-particle adhesion. Interfacial and photovoltaic properties of flexible dye sensitized solar cells with a ruthenium dye involving two tetra-butyl ammonium carboxylate groups (N- 719) were studied. The maximum power conversion efficiency of 4. 2 % is obtained under illumination of 100 mWcm- 2, for the electrodes fabricated using 20 hour milled slurry and shorter or longer milling times were found to be less optimal. During the second stage of this work, binder-free titania pastes with high viscosity were developed for the preparation of improved quality electrodes for dye sensitized solar cells on plastic substrates. Rheological behavior of ethanol based titania pastes with the addition of ammonia, hydrochloric acid and water was investigated. The change in the viscosity is correlated with the measured zeta potential of the colloidal titania pastes. Improved inter-particle connectivity and hence better solar cell performance was found for the pastes containing acid or water. However, no such improvements were seen for the pastes containing ammonia. Maximum light to electrical energy conversion efficiencies of 4. 9 % and 5. 0 % were obtained for the plastic based dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated using water and acid-added slurries respectively. Thirdly, chemically-sintered, mesoporous ZnO electrodes with improved interparticle connectivity were prepared in the absence of any organic binders, using ammonia as the sole reagent to encourage interparticle connectivity. The reaction with ammonium hydroxide was found to increase the connections between ZnO grains by forming nanorods like a structure. The enhancement of adhesion among ZnO grains was evaluated from nano-scratch technique. Two different xanthene dyes were used to sensitize ZnO electrodes. The photo-voltage of 657 mV, fill-factor of 73 % and photo-current of 4. 1 mAcm- 2 with the maximum light to-electrical energy conversion efficiency of 2. 0 % were obtained for plastic based ZnO|Mercurochrome|electrolyte solar cell under 100 mWcm- 2 light intensity. One of the biggest challenges for DSSCs on plastic substrates is the difficulty in making good quality nano porous TiO 2 films with both good mechanical stability and high electrical conductivity. Cold isostatic pressing (CIP) is a powder compaction technique that applies an isostatic pressure to a powder sample in all directions. It is particularly suitable for making thin films on plastic substrates and even on non-flat surfaces. During the final stage of this work, cold isostatically-pressed nanocrytalline TiO 2 electrodes with excellent mechanical robustness are prepared on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrates in the absence of organic binders, and without heat treatment. The morphology and the physical properties of the TiO 2 films prepared by the CIP method were found to be very compatible with requirements for fabricating flexible DSSCs on plastics. This room-temperature processing technique has led to an important technical breakthrough in producing high efficiency flexible DSSCs. Devices fabricated on ITO/PEN films by this method using standard P- 25 TiO 2 films with a Ru-complex sensitizer yielded a maximum IPCE of 72 % at the wavelength of 530 nm and showed high conversion efficiencies of 6. 3 % and 7. 4 % for incident light intensities of 100 and 15 mWcm- 2, respectively, which are the highest power conversion efficiencies achieved so far for any DSSC on a polymer substrate using the widely-used, commercially-available P- 25 TiO 2 powder...|$|R
40|$|As {{consumers}} have become proactive {{in health and}} medical issues, sales of healthy foods have recorded higher growth rate. Therefore, the concept of everyday foods containing ingredients with defined health benefits will significantly influence the types of new foods developed. New Zealanders are among the world's largest consumers of honey, propolis, and other bee products. Further, confirmation of antibacterial properties of a unique NZ honey, manuka honey, has increased its price manifolds. A market research study indicated that potential exists for a familiar confectionery with nutraceutical properties. As a result, jellybeans with added functional properties were developed. Flavour, texture, antibacterial properties, and price were the important attributes to consumers. Lemon flavour was identified as the most acceptable flavour. Jellybeans containing 'active' manuka honey, propolis, were developed using bench top facilities available at the Massey University. The antibacterial properties of manuka honey {{were found to be}} stable at 85 ° C for an hour, and for propolis they were stable at 95 ° C for 2 hours. In the literature, no procedure was found for testing the antibacterial properties of confectionery products. A 3 -step method was developed for the removal of the interfering substances other than sugar, reduction of sugar, and final estimation of antibacterial properties. This gives extract, largely free of interfering substances and antibacterial components in a measurable quantity. The product and process were optimized by Response Surface Methodology (Echip). Using TAXT 2 for testing the texture, prototypes were screened down to suitable 8 formulations. Cost was then used as a screening factor to determine the prototypes for sensory testing. Eight prototypes were evaluated with a trained panel as well as consumer panel. External (PREFMAP) and internal preference mapping (MDPREF) was used to interpret the data collected from these two panels. No consensus was reached for the most preferred product. Further, cluster analysis was performed on the results of MDPREF to understand preferences of specific consumers. The study indicated that about half the consumer panel did not have marked differences in liking for the various jellybean prototypes. The product that was preferred by second largest cluster {{and at the same time}} well liked by the largest cluster was therefore selected for commercial trial. The product was low in hardness, chewiness, and denseness. The most preferred product was made from 9. 2 % starch, 5 % gelatin, 10. 2 % honey, 1. 8 % propolis extract, 20 % sugar, and 42 % corn syrup. At deposition in the starch the product had 71 - 72 % dissolved solids. The optimized product formulation was scaled up at Cadbury's Confectionery Limited, Auckland. The jellybeans were processed in a Terbraak static cooker. The slurry was cooked to 135 - 140 ° C and was then rapidly cooled under vacuum to 95 ° C. Total solids of slurry were kept at 65 - 66 % due to about 5 % moisture evaporation in the plant to get final dissolved solids at 71 - 72 % before deposition in starch. The antibacterial components and lemon flavour was added to the <b>slurry</b> before <b>deposition.</b> The <b>slurry</b> was taken out of the starch at 12 - 14 % moisture and soft panned. The jellybeans were found to have antibacterial properties. The commercially produced developed product was tested with 51 consumers using a Central Location Test (CLT). The developed product had an overall liking comparable to the commercially available jellybeans. About 69 % of the panelists showed their willingness to buy this product. The Home Use Test (HUT) held over 8 weeks verified the results of CLT. In HUT 66 % of the consumers liked this unique idea and showed preference over the currently available product. About 65 % showed willingness to replace the current product. HUT provided validity of the results from CLT and liking of the product did not drop over time (p> 0. 05) and to the repeated exposure. The results also indicated that immediate use response (Week- 0, CLT) for the consumer acceptance could be used as a valid predictor of the extended use responses (Week - 8, HUT). As the product's overall liking score is very high (7. 5), it is ready for a launch. However, minor changes in the attributes may be considered after market trial. The developed product has antibacterial properties, which were tested by a method developed during the study. As the product offers lot of potential, a food company has shown interest to market this product...|$|R
