25|$|I {{remember}} {{as a child}} {{that she had a}} drinking problem. She had difficulty coping with {{the ups and downs of}} the business… As a child, I thought, 'She has a drinking problem and she's an alcoholic.' That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, <b>seeing</b> <b>your</b> mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E
500|$|Cassandra Jardine, a Daily Telegraph contributor, {{opined that}} Essjay was [...] "hooked on 'Wiki crack'—devotees' jargon for {{the thrill of}} <b>seeing</b> <b>your</b> efforts debated." [...] She further {{observed}} that [...] "Essjay has provided a reminder that any given entry could {{have been written by}} someone as ignorant as ourselves. On the other hand, no one has taken issue with his edits, only his assumed persona, so perhaps the real lesson of this democratic medium is that college drop-outs might be as authoritative as professors." ...|$|E
500|$|Asche {{is married}} to Angela Albers, whom he presumably met in college at Nebraska. He {{is a fan of}} {{football}} and an ardent supporter of the Nebraska Cornhuskers; he routinely drives six hours to attend their home football games. He also [...] "appreciates the speed and violence of hockey"; conversely, he does not like basketball. During the offseason, he resides in O'Fallon, Missouri, which is barely over [...] from his birthplace of St. Charles, Missouri. According to his MLB.com biography, his hobbies include golfing, fishing, and completing crossword puzzles. In an interview, Asche said his favorite television show was Parks and Recreation, and his favorite food was chicken parmesan. He is close to his family, and noted that he started playing baseball around age five or six, with his first experience being playing in the back yard with his father and brother. When he was first called up to the major leagues, he noted, [...] "Emotions were crazy. Trying to hold back tears <b>seeing</b> <b>your</b> parents in the stands for the first time was tough, then playing on top of that made it a little crazy to start. But that is all part of it. I think the phone call I got to make to my parents the day I was called up was the most memorable part ..." ...|$|E

500|$|Wilson, Ted Danson, and Jean Smart {{completed}} the principal cast by January 2015. Wilson appeared as officer Lou Solverson, Danson as sheriff Hank Larsson, and Smart as Floyd Gerhardt, the matriarch of the Gerhardt crime family. Wilson's casting was unique {{because he was}} the only performer to portray an already established character; Keith Carradine played Lou for the show's first season, set 27 years after the events of season two. As such, Hawley did not want to take cues from Carradine because Lou was [...] "at a different point" [...] in his life, although Wilson analyzed Carradine's performance to a point. Wilson was persuaded by Fargo critical accolades and commercial success; the actor said: [...] "There have been several times that you’ve given your heart and soul to an independent film and more often than not it doesn’t match up to any commercial success or people <b>seeing</b> <b>your</b> film. So [...] were like, 'You need to do something that people see'." [...] Danson found learning the Minnesota accent difficult; to improve, he began practicing {{as soon as he was}} signed, often on set before filming began. Smart's role required an older look, which producers achieved by cutting and dyeing her hair, and Hawley gave the actress a book of paintings by Andrew Wyeth to explain her character.|$|E

2500|$|... {{people in}} Silicon Valley, {{who are not}} celebrities and who have no desire other than to build a great startup, a post on Valleywag comes as a huge shock. <b>Seeing</b> <b>your</b> {{marriage}} woes, DUI or employment termination up on a popular public website (permanently indexed by search engines) is simply more than they can handle.

6000|$|... "Who {{would believe}} me?" [...] he asked; [...] "though, indeed, who would question, <b>seeing</b> that <b>your</b> life is forfeit {{to me or}} any who can take it? Yet that {{is a matter of}} which the King's Justices shall judge." ...|$|R

2500|$|On September 25, 2013, Voltaire {{announced}} on his official blog, {{that he and}} his wife were to be divorced. Saying, quote, [...] "On October 1st of this year, my wife and I would be celebrating our 4th year wedding anniversary. Unfortunately, it's not to be. After nearly four years of marriage and a couple more of dating, we are parting ways. It saddens me so deeply that things didn't work out. It's been a difficult process for both of us to come to this decision, one that I really don't wish upon anyone. Nothing is worse than <b>seeing</b> <b>your</b> best friend in pain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Somewhat more iconoclastic {{views of}} the film and its content are {{occasionally}} expressed. In 1947, film critic Manny Farber wrote, [...] "To make his points [...] always takes an easy, simple-minded path that doesn't give much credit to the intelligence of the audience", and adds {{that there are only}} a [...] "few unsentimental moments here and there." [...] Wendell Jamieson, in a 2008 article for The New York Times which was generally positive in its analysis of the film, noted that far from being simply a sweet sentimental story, it [...] "is a terrifying, asphyxiating story about growing up and relinquishing your dreams, of <b>seeing</b> <b>your</b> father driven to the grave before his time, of living among bitter, small-minded people. It is a story of being trapped, of compromising, of watching others move ahead and away, of becoming so filled with rage that you verbally abuse your children, their teacher and your oppressively perfect wife." ...|$|E
2500|$|Călinescu saw Ranetti's verse as {{carried by}} his [...] "sufficient if amateurish culture", {{requiring}} {{of the reader}} [...] "a certain finesse". With his poetic debut as [...] "Dom Paladu", Ranetti parodied and impersonated George D. Pallade, the National Liberal Party politico, making abundant use of 1890s Bucharest slang. In his fictional avatar, Pallade appeared as [...] "a great carouser, something of a rube, and a lover of womenfolk". One such piece has Dom Paladu complaining about the arrival of autumn, which inevitably slows down his philandering—he expresses his wish to [...] "discuss matters of love with the ladies"—but not as socialists expect him to. Works in the genre include stanzas written in French for a Romanian public, translating Romanian idioms and proverbs in literal fashion. For instance, he referred to an insignificant loss as to a dommage en champignons (from the Romanian pagubă-n ciuperci, [...] "a waste of mushrooms"), and to a very unlikely situation as quand tu verrais ton chignon (când ți-oi vedea ceafa, [...] "when you'll be <b>seeing</b> <b>your</b> nape").|$|E

2500|$|Dickson {{approached}} the five original members of The Byrds {{in order to}} have them sign a letter of permission to authorize the release of these early recordings. [...] David Crosby was initially reluctant to sanction the release but he was eventually persuaded by his friend and singing partner, Graham Nash, who convinced Crosby of the musical worth and historical value of the recordings. [...] Dickson later recalled Nash's involvement during a 1977 interview: [...] "Graham Nash said that the songs were charming baby pictures. You have to get a little older before you can tolerate <b>seeing</b> <b>your</b> baby pictures out there. We were all babies once! Graham just charmed David's socks off." [...] With the permission of all five original members of the band secured, Together Records released the album in July 1969 {{with a great deal of}} publicity. [...] As a collection of previously unreleased demo recordings, Preflyte can be seen as one of the earliest examples of issuing outtakes by popular artists, a practice that is now commonplace in the reissue market.|$|E
