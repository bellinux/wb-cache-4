2500|$|On June 30, 1954, Farmer {{was able}} to win Rodgers and Beeson's {{approval}} for a new jurisdictional standard for the NLRB. [...] Under the new standard, a company {{would have to have}} interstate sales of at least $50,000 a year (double the Herzog Board's <b>standard),</b> <b>supply</b> interstate goods or services worth at least $100,000 (double the Herzog Board's standard), or provide trucking to interstate firms worth at least $100,000 a year (a new standard). Franchises of interstate companies would no longer fall under the Board's jurisdiction. In a series of cases in October 1954, the board applied its new jurisdictional standard, establishing new precedents that eliminated perhaps 25 percent of the NLRB's jurisdiction (although affected less than 10 percent of its caseload and just 1 percent of the number of employees covered). Describing the Board's actions to Sherman Adams (Eisenhower's White House Chief of Staff), Farmer said the NLRB had created a [...] "no man's land" [...] in which the law did not apply.|$|E

However, by the time that the next major electrification project, the West Coast Main Line (WCML), was underway, the decision had been taken to adopt 25 kV ac overhead as the <b>standard</b> <b>supply</b> system.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the start}} of the Internet revolution, {{electronic}} commerce was seen as a tool of disintermediation for cutting operating costs. The concept was that by allowing consumers to purchase products directly from producers via the Internet, the product delivery chain would be drastically shortened, thereby [...] "disintermediating" [...] the <b>standard</b> <b>supply</b> model middlemen. However, what largely happened was that new intermediaries appeared in the digital landscape (e.g., Amazon.com and eBay).|$|E
5000|$|Unlike <b>standard</b> <b>supply</b> chain {{management}} practices world-wide, some major concepts are not supported {{in the military}} domain. For example, the [...] "just-in-time" [...] (JIT) model emphasizes holding less (or no) inventory, whereas in military supply chains, due to {{the high costs of}} a stock-out (potentially placing lives in danger), keeping huge inventory is a more acceptable practice. Some examples of these are the ammunition dump and oil depot.|$|E
50|$|The correct {{supply voltage}} is communicated by the {{microprocessor}} to the VRM at startup via {{a number of}} bits called VID (voltage identification). In particular, the VRM initially provides a <b>standard</b> <b>supply</b> voltage to the VID logic, which {{is the part of}} the processor whose only aim is to then send the VID to the VRM. When the VRM has received the VID identifying the required supply voltage, it starts acting as a voltage regulator, providing the required constant voltage supply to the processor.|$|E

50|$|On a <b>standard</b> <b>supply</b> {{and demand}} diagram, {{consumer}} surplus {{is the area}} (triangular if the supply and demand curves are linear) above the equilibrium price of the good and below the demand curve. This {{reflects the fact that}} consumers would have been willing to buy a single unit of the good at a price higher than the equilibrium price, a second unit at a price below that but still above the equilibrium price, etc., yet they in fact pay just the equilibrium price for each unit they buy.|$|E
50|$|Stokmark is a {{simulation}} {{of the stock}} market. Up to eight players take turns to either buy or sell shares in a choice of four companies. As well as the price, players are given the price-to-earnings ratio and dividend yield. Prices change instantly when transactions are made (usually based on the <b>standard</b> <b>supply</b> and demand principle {{although there is a}} random element). After each round a news story is displayed which affects the value of certain shares. After every four rounds, players are awarded dividends on the shares they hold and are ranked on their total current value (of both cash and shares). The object of the game is to make the largest amount of profit.|$|E
50|$|Alfred Marshall was {{the first}} to develop the <b>standard</b> <b>supply</b> and demand graph demonstrating a number of {{fundamentals}} regarding supply and demand including the supply and demand curves, market equilibrium, the relationship between quantity and price in regards to supply and demand, the law of marginal utility, the law of diminishing returns, and the ideas of consumer and producer surpluses. This model is now used by economists in various forms using different variables to demonstrate several other economic principles. Marshall's model allowed a visual representation of complex economic fundamentals where before all the ideas and theories were only capable of being explained through words. These models are now critical throughout the study of economics because they allow a clear and concise representation of the fundamentals or theories being explained.|$|E

50|$|The usual {{economic}} analysis of externalities can be illustrated using a <b>standard</b> <b>supply</b> and demand diagram if the externality can be valued {{in terms of}} money. An extra supply or demand curve is added, as in the diagrams below. One of the curves is the private cost that consumers pay as individuals for additional quantities of the good, which in competitive markets, is the marginal private cost. The other curve is the true cost that {{society as a whole}} pays for production and consumption of increased production the good, or the marginal social cost. Similarly there might be two curves for the demand or benefit of the good. The social demand curve would reflect the benefit to society as a whole, while the normal demand curve reflects the benefit to consumers as individuals and is reflected as effective demand in the market.|$|E
50|$|Early in 1864, the {{commander}} of the Army of the Cumberland, Major General George H. Thomas, was seeking a light-weight, easy-to-haul and erect pontoon bridge to move his troops across unfordable rivers and streams. Knowing the limitations of the two systems used by the armies in the Western Theater, he had folding pontoons developed. A similar idea had been instigated by his predecessor William S. Rosecrans earlier in the war, but had not been adopted. Captain William E. Merrill, Thomas's chief engineer, improved on Rosecrans's prototype, making it lighter and stronger. He replaced the pins that held individual sections together with hinges so that the side frame sections folded together instead of separating. The new design yielded a portable boat that was lightweight, small enough to carry on a <b>standard</b> <b>supply</b> wagon, and easier to construct in the field. It was also strong enough to support horse-drawn artillery and fully loaded wagons.|$|E

Within a <b>standard</b> <b>supply</b> and demand framework, the capacity of medical schools is considered as an endogenous element within a complete structural system of the market for physicians' services. The parameters of the model are estimated using data from the postwar period.

The results of this exercise support the applicability of traditional economics to this sector of the economy. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A digital {{differential}} transmitter {{based on}} CMOS inverter worked up to 2. 8 Gbps at the supply voltage of 1 V with a 0. 18 μm CMOS process. By calibrating the output impedance of the transmitter, the impedance matching between the transmitter output and {{the transmission line}} is achieved. The PVT variations of pre-driver are compensated by the calibration of the rising-edge delay and falling-edge delay of the pre-driver outputs. The chip fabricated with a 0. 18 μm CMOS process, which uses the <b>standard</b> <b>supply</b> voltage of 1. 8 V, gives the highest data rate of 4 Gbps at the supply voltage of 1. 2 V. The proposed calibration schemes improve the eye opening with the voltage margin by 200 % and the timing margin b...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{mortgage loan}} demand in Argentina {{using a new}} survey administered in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area. It finds that recurring macro volatility and violation of financial property rights have increased demand for real estate as an investment, which in turn boosts housing prices and {{makes it more difficult}} for consumer households to meet minimum income requirements for obtaining a mortgage. Affordability thus seems to offer a better explanation than <b>standard</b> <b>supply</b> side constraints for the small size of the mortgage market in Argentina. Overall, the shallow mortgage market has not posed a major impediment to home ownership in Argentina and the small (and shrinking) mortgage market {{has more to do with}} lack of demand than credit supply constraints. ...|$|E
