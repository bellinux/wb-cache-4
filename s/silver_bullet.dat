5|$|In folklore, silver was {{commonly}} {{thought to}} have mystic powers: for example, a bullet cast from silver is often supposed in such folklore the only weapon that is effective against a werewolf, witch, or other monsters. From this the idiom of a <b>silver</b> <b>bullet</b> developed into figuratively referring to any simple solution with very high effectiveness or almost miraculous results, as in the widely discussed software engineering paper No <b>Silver</b> <b>Bullet.</b> Silver also has more negative cultural meanings: the idiom , referring to a reward for betrayal, references the bribe Judas Iscariot is said in the New Testament to have taken from Jewish leaders in Jerusalem to turn Jesus of Nazareth over to soldiers of the high priest Caiaphas.|$|E

25|$|This movie {{draws on}} {{elements}} of traditional folklore and fiction, {{such as the}} vulnerability of the werewolf to a <b>silver</b> <b>bullet</b> (as seen for instance in the legend of Beast of Gévaudan), though at the climax of the film the Wolf Man is actually dispatched with a silver-headed cane.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{vulnerability}} to the <b>silver</b> <b>bullet,</b> {{the full moon}} being {{the cause of the}} transformation only became part of the depiction of werewolves on a widespread basis in the twentieth century. The first movie to feature the transformative effect of the full moon was Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man in 1943.|$|E
25|$|Most modern fiction {{describes}} werewolves {{as vulnerable}} to silver weapons and highly resistant to other injuries. This feature appears in German folklore of the 19th century. The {{claim that the}} Beast of Gévaudan, an 18th-century wolf or wolf-like creature, was shot by a <b>silver</b> <b>bullet</b> {{appears to have been}} introduced by novelists retelling the story from 1935 onwards and not in earlier versions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>bullets</b> also act as {{a calling}} card for The Lone Ranger in his adventures. The masked man decided to use bullets forged from the {{precious}} metal {{as a symbol of}} justice, law and order, and to remind himself and others that life, like silver, has value and is not to be wasted or thrown away. In the 3rd episode, his friend, who will be making his bullets for him, mentions killing villains with the bullets and the Lone Ranger explains that he will not shoot to kill; he will let the law dispense justice. The <b>silver</b> <b>bullets</b> will be as symbols of justice. Whether he actually used <b>silver</b> <b>bullets</b> in his guns varies depending on story and medium. In the radio series, the Lone Ranger used only lead bullets as weapons, while the <b>silver</b> <b>bullets</b> were used symbolically. In the 1981 feature film, The Lone Ranger used <b>silver</b> <b>bullets</b> in his guns as he was told that silver was far more solid than lead slugs and provided a straighter shot. The Lone Ranger's usage of bullet made from valuable metal like silver is satirized in an episode of Robot Chicken where after expertly shooting a tin can in the air, the Ranger's sidekick Tonto laments that the amount of silver the Ranger thoughtlessly wasted could have bought enough food to feed Tonto's entire village for a year.|$|R

25|$|In 1811, Christophe proclaimed himself King Henri I in the North and {{commissioned}} several extraordinary buildings. He even {{created a}} nobility {{class in the}} fashion of European monarchies. Yet in 1820, weakened by illness and with a decreasing support for his authoritarian regime, he killed himself with a <b>silver</b> <b>bullet</b> rather than face a coup d'état. Immediately after, Pétion's successor, Boyer, reunited Haiti through diplomatic tactics, and ruled as president until his overthrow in 1843.|$|E
25|$|Between March and May 1978 Sweet {{extensively}} {{toured the}} US, as a support act for Bob Seger and the <b>Silver</b> <b>Bullet</b> Band. The tour included a disastrous date in Birmingham, Alabama on 3 May, during which visiting Capitol Records {{executives in the}} audience saw Brian Connolly give a drunken and incoherent performance that terminated early in the set with his collapse on stage, leaving {{the rest of the}} group to play on without him. The band returned briefly to Britain before resuming the second leg of their US tour in late May supporting other acts, including Foghat and Alice Cooper, finishing the US tour in early July 1978. Brian's alcoholism was steadily becoming a greater issue.|$|E
25|$|Oliver Cromwell laid siege to Clonmel in May 1650. The {{walls were}} {{eventually}} breached, but Hugh Dubh O'Neill, {{the commander of}} the town's garrison, inflicted heavy losses on the New Model Army when they tried to storm the breach. That night, O'Neill, deciding that further resistance was hopeless {{due to a lack of}} ammunition, led his soldiers and camp followers out of the town under cover of darkness. The story is told that Cromwell became suspicious of O'Neill's desperate situation when a <b>silver</b> <b>bullet</b> was discharged by the townspeople at his troops outside the walls. The following morning, 18 May 1650, mayor John White was able to surrender the town on good terms as Cromwell was still unaware of the garrison's escape just hours before. Although feeling deceived, he did not put the inhabitants 'to the sword' as occurred elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Different {{strains of}} Triticeae exist for {{different}} industrial applications; durum for pasta and food pastes, {{two types of}} barley for beer, bread wheats used in different areas with different growing conditions. Replacing these motifs is not a plausible task since a contamination of 0.02% wheat in a gluten-free diet {{is considered to be}} pathogenic and would require replacing the motifs in all known regional varieties—potentially thousands of genetic modifications. Class I and antibody responses are downstream of Class II recognition and are of little remedial value in change. The innate response peptide could be a <b>silver</b> <b>bullet,</b> assuming there is only one of these per protein and only a few genome loci with the protein. Unresolved questions relevant to a complete understanding of immune responses to gluten are: Why is the rate of late onset gluten sensitivity rapidly rising? Is this truly a wheat problem, or something that is being done to wheat, or to those who are eating wheat (for example, communicable diseases a trigger? Some individuals are susceptible by genetics (early onset), but many late onset cases could have different triggers because there is nothing genetically separating the 30 to 40% of people that could have Triticeae sensitivity from the ~1% that, in their lifetime, will have some level of this disease.|$|E
