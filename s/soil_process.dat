On urban sites where research interests may make a detailed examination of the earliest part of the record impractical, prehistoric or rudimentary human activity may go unrecorded, {{as opposed to an}} equivalent horizon on a rural site for which the study team's agenda is to look for prehistoric evidence. Chemical and <b>soil</b> <b>process</b> over time often obscure and cause decomposition of cultural materials, and thus a human-occupied layer may look natural. Additionally, early prehistoric tools were manufactured from natural materials, such as bone, stone and fiber; they do not stand out as clearly as metal, glass and plastic. The effect of decompositional processes is that the older an archaeological deposit is, the more it will appear similar to the underlying geology. For some archaeologists, a basic rule of thumb is [...] "the greater the contrast a context has with the natural, the younger it is." [...] Similarly, United States prehistoric archaeologists often rely on significantly diminished counts of lithic flake debitage to assess the excavation unit's trend toward natural stratigraphy. While a trend may be recognized, a stratum is not called natural or sterile, unless it is void of cultural materials.|$|E

As a step toward answering this question, we evaluated N cycling processes and aspects of their regulation on a climate gradient on Kohala Volcano, Hawaii, USA. The gradient extends from sites receiving 3, 000  mm/yr, and the pedology and dynamics of rock-derived nutrients in soils on the gradient are well understood. In particular, there is a <b>soil</b> <b>process</b> domain at intermediate rainfall within which ongoing weathering and biological uplift have enriched total and available pools of rock-derived nutrients substantially; sites at higher rainfall than this domain are acid and infertile {{as a consequence of}} depletion of rock-derived nutrients, while sites at lower rainfall are unproductive and subject to wind erosion. We found elevated rates of potential net N mineralization in the domain where rock-derived nutrients are enriched. Higher-rainfall sites have low rates of potential net N mineralization and high rates of microbial N immobilization, despite relatively high rates of gross N mineralization. Lower-rainfall sites have moderately low potential net N mineralization, relatively low rates of gross N mineralization, and rates of microbial N immobilization sufficient to sequester almost all the mineral N produced. Bulk soil δ 15 N also varied along the gradient, from + 4 ‰ at high rainfall sites to + 14 ‰ at low rainfall sites, indicating differences in the sources and dynamics of soil N.

Existing {{evidence suggests that}} functional diversity rather than species richness is relevant for soil functioning. However, the importance of functional diversity has rarely been assessed simultaneously at more than one trophic level, critically limiting the prediction of consequences {{of biodiversity}} loss for soil functioning. In a laboratory microcosm experiment, we tested the hypothesis that increasing functional dissimilarity of both litter-feeding soil fauna and litter mixtures interactively affects the rates of five different soil processes related to litter decomposition. We created trait-based functional dissimilarity gradients using five assemblages of two detritivore species and five mixtures of two plant litter species commonly found in Mediterranean shrubland ecosystems of southern France. With increasing drought periods predicted for Mediterranean ecosystems in the future, we additionally included two different watering frequencies to evaluate the impact of drought on soil processes and how drought interacts with functional dissimilarity. The different fauna assemblages and litter mixtures showed strong effects on litter mass loss, soil organic carbon and nitrogen leaching, {{as well as on}} soil microbial activities. Up to 20 % of the variation in response variables was explained by functional dissimilarity, suggesting an ecologically relevant impact of functional diversity on <b>soil</b> <b>process</b> rates. Detritivore functional dissimilarity tended to have stronger effects when combined with increasingly dissimilar litter mixtures, suggesting that trait dissimilarity interacts across trophic levels. Drought affected several soil processes but did not modify the relationships between functional dissimilarity and process rates.

Warming did not influence AOB diversity and function. Sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene fragments retrieved from DGGE gel revealed that they were all related to Nitrosospira-like sequences.

The indicators we measured included soil microbial biomass C/N/P and soil enzymatic activities of phosphatase (AP) disbounding organic phosphate, cellobiohydrolase (CBH), beta-glucocidase (BG), N-releasing enzyme N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) as well as soil respirations, during and after the treatments. It was found that the manipulated event induced a rapid shift in microbial biomass and activities, indicating a lower resistance of the underground process. However, the microbial and biochemical parameters saw rapid recovery after the event, which meant the <b>soil</b> <b>processes</b> enjoyed high resilience. The high responsiveness and lag-time effects of the soil indicators rendered new horizons for us to evaluate the interaction between the extremes and the ecosystem stability. Our study indicated that the once-in-a-century extreme drought induced very short term response in the <b>soil</b> biotic <b>process,</b> and the <b>soil</b> <b>processes</b> worked to buffer against such events under the observation period...|$|R

Seasonal and quasi- 3 -yr periodical interrelationships in the system ‘precipitation-groundwater depth- groundwater salinity- soil salinity’ are discussed. ...|$|R
