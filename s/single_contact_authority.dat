Trills may be realized as a <b>single</b> <b>contact,</b> like a flap, but are variable, whereas a flap {{is limited to}} a <b>single</b> <b>contact.</b> When a trill is brief and made with a <b>single</b> <b>contact</b> it is sometimes erroneously described as an (allophonic) flap, but a true flap is an active articulation whereas a trill is a passive articulation. That is, for a tap or flap the tongue makes an active gesture to contact the target place of articulation, whereas with a trill the contact is due to the vibration caused by the airstream rather than any active movement.|$|R
