40|$|Precomputed {{radiance}} transfer (PRT) captures realistic lighting {{effects from}} distant, low-frequency environmental lighting {{but has been}} limited to static models or precomputed sequences. We focus on PRT for local effects such as bumps, wrinkles, or other detailed features, but extend it to arbitrarily deformable models. Our approach applies zonal harmonics (ZH) which approximate spherical functions as sums of circularly symmetric Legendre polynomials around different axes. By spatially varying both the axes and coefficients of these basis functions, we can fit to spatially varying transfer signals. Compared to the spherical harmonic (SH) basis, the ZH basis yields a more compact approximation. More important, it can be trivially rotated whereas SH rotation is expensive and unsuited for dense per-vertex or per-pixel evaluation. This property allows, for the first time, PRT to be mapped onto deforming models which re-orient the local coordinate frame. We generate ZH transfer models by fitting to PRT signals simulated on meshes or simple parametric models for thin membranes and wrinkles. We show how shading with ZH transfer can be significantly accelerated by specializing to a given lighting environment. Finally, we demonstrate real-time rendering results with soft shadows, inter-reflections, and <b>subsurface</b> <b>scatter</b> on deforming models...|$|R

The original model can still be glimpsed briefly in the first film. Over Christmas 2001 the crew proceeded to reanimate all the previous shots accordingly within two months. Another problem was that the crew realized that the cast performed better in the versions of the film with Serkis. In the end, the CG Gollum was often animated on top of these scenes and Serkis would be painted out. Due to Gollum not being human, shots such as him crawling down a sheer cliff were shot with no live reference. Serkis also did motion-capture for the character which would drive the body of the model, whilst animators did all fingers and facial animation. Gino Acevedo supervised realistic skin tones, which for the first time used <b>subsurface</b> <b>scattering</b> shader, taking four hours per frame to render.

40|$|Microwave {{observations}} of soils at L- to X-band are commonly interpreted {{in terms of}} surface scattering. However, recent {{observations of}} the backscatter and the differential interferometric response indicate that <b>subsurface</b> volume <b>scattering</b> may often {{be more important than}} generally thought. The dependence of the subsurface backscatter and interferometric return on soil moisture remains poorly understood as most observations are indirect in that they are confounded with the surface contribution. Here, we aim to elucidate the impact of soil moisture on <b>subsurface</b> volume <b>scattering</b> by employing depth-resolved observations at C-band with a depth resolution of 5 – 10 cm, thus isolating the subsurface contribution. For the sandy soil analyzed in the experiment, the volumetric subsurface backscattered power is strongly affected by soil moisture (> 15 dB) : It appears to be governed by the local soil moisture content (local dielectric constant and its spatial variability) and the soil moisture content above (absorption). When the soil moisture changes, the observed interferometric response is consistent with the notion that the subsurface return is mainly governed by the changing optical path through the soil. By modeling and inverting this relation of the interferometric phase to soil moisture, we derive the first spatially continuous estimates of soil moisture profiles based on the clutter. These findings indicate the potential of depth-resolved observations to provide direct, spatially extensive information about the vertical variability of soil moisture, and to inform models of the subsurface response...|$|R

40|$|This paper compares four {{continental}} {{ice sheet}} radar altimeter retracking algorithms using airborne radar and laser altimeter data taken over the Greenland ice sheet in 1991. The refurbished Advanced Application Flight Experiment (AAFE) airborne radar altimeter has a large range window and stores the entire return waveform during flight. Once the return waveforms are retracked, or post-processed to obtain the most accurate altitude measurement possible, they are compared with the high-precision Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL) altimeter measurements. The AAFE waveforms show evidence of varying degrees of both surface and volume scattering from {{different regions of the}} Greenland ice sheet. The AOL laser altimeter, however, obtains a return only {{from the surface of the}} ice sheet. Retracking altimeter waveforms with a surface scattering model results in a good correlation with the laser measurements in the wet and dry-snow zones, but in the percolation region of the ice sheet, the deviation between the two data sets is large due to the effects of <b>subsurface</b> and volume <b>scattering.</b> The Martin et al model results in a lower bias than the surface scattering model, but still shows an increase in the noise level in the percolation zone. Using an Offset Center of Gravity algorithm to retrack altimeter waveforms results in measurements that are only slightly affected by <b>subsurface</b> and volume <b>scattering</b> and, despite a higher bias, this algorithm works well in all regions of the ice sheet. A cubic spline provides retracked altitudes that agree with AOL measurements over all regions of Greenland. This method is not sensitive to changes in the scattering mechanisms of the ice sheet and it has the lowest noise level and bias of all the retracking methods presented...|$|R
