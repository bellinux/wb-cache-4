He had {{acquired}} a tent of green cloth upon sticks, with a window of <b>soft</b> <b>glass</b> {{that could not be}} broken. All coveted the tent. It was three paces long and two wide. Among the covetous was an Officer of Artillery, in charge of a gun that shook mountains. It gave out a shell of ten maunds or more [eight hundred pounds]. But those who have never seen even a rivulet cannot imagine the Indus. He offered many rupees to purchase the tent. He would come at all hours increasing his offer. He overwhelmed the owner with talk about it." [...] [I heard them often, Sahib.] [...] "At last, and I heard this also, that tent-owner said to that Artillery Officer:--'I am wearied with your importunity. Destroy to-day a certain house that I shall show you, and I will give you the tent for a gift. Otherwise, have no more talk.' He showed him the roof of a certain white house which stood back three kos [six miles] in the enemy country, a little underneath a hill with woods on each side. Consider this, measuring three kos in your mind along the Amritsar Road. The Gunner Officer said:--'By God, I accept this bargain.' He issued orders and estimated the distance. I saw him going back and forth as swiftly as a lover. Then fire was delivered and at the fourth discharge the watchers through their glasses saw the house spring high and spread abroad and lie upon its face. It was as a tooth taken out by a barber. Seeing this, the Gunner Officer sprang into the tent and looked through the window and smiled because the tent was now his. But the enemy did not understand the reasons. There was a great gunfire all that night, as well as many enemy-regiments moving about. The prisoners taken afterwards told us their commanders were disturbed at the fall of the house, ascribing it to some great design on our part, so that their men had no rest for a week.

5000|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>glass</b> is {{sometimes}} useful because it melts at lower temperatures, however {{it does not}} react well to quick temperature changes like borosilicate glass does. <b>Soft</b> <b>glass</b> expands and contracts {{a lot more than}} hard glass when heated/cooled, and must be kept at an even temperature while working with it, especially if the piece being made has sections of varying thickness. If thin areas cool below the [...] "stress point", shrinking can cause a crack. Hard glass, or borosilicate, shrinks much less, so is more forgiving. Borosilicate is just like regular silicate glass (SiO2), but it has a more flexible molecular structure from being doped with boron.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{with the}} {{resurgence}} of lampworking as a technique to make handmade glass beads, borosilicate has become a popular material in many glass artists' studios. Borosilicate for beadmaking comes in thin, pencil-like rods. Northstar, Trautman Art Glass, Glass Alchemy and Momka's Glass are popular manufacturers, although there are other brands available. The metals used to color borosilicate glass, particularly silver, often create strikingly beautiful and unpredictable results when melted in an oxygen-gas torch flame. Because it is more shock-resistant and stronger than <b>soft</b> <b>glass,</b> borosilicate is particularly suited for pipe making, as well as sculpting figures and creating large beads.

Also, its working range is at higher temperatures than the <b>soft</b> <b>glasses,</b> requiring the use of oxygen/gas flames instead of air/gas. In addition to producing a hotter flame, the use of pure oxygen allows {{more control over the}} flame's oxidizing or reducing properties, which is necessary because some coloring chemicals in borosilicate glass react with any remaining oxygen in the flame either to produce the desired final color or to discolor if extra oxygen is present.|$|R

5000|$|Glass cutters are {{manufactured}} with wheels of varying diameters. [...] One {{of the most}} popular has a diameter of 5.5 mm ( [...] in).

5000|$|Generally, such fibers are {{constructed}} by the same methods as other optical fibers: first, one constructs a [...] "preform" [...] {{on the scale of}} centimeters in size, and then heats the preform and draws it down to a much smaller diameter (often nearly as small as a human hair), shrinking the preform cross section but (usually) maintaining the same features.

Controlled dispersion of nanoparticles in nanocomposites is often a critical requirement and has lead to evolution {{of a variety of}} strategies for regulating nanoparticle interactions and assembly. This work focuses on one such technique wherein the nanoparticle surfaces are densely tethered with polymer chains. Complete screening of the interparticle interactions and steric repulsion among the tethered chains thus results in repulsive and stable nanoparticles across a range of polymer molecular weights and chemistries and nanoparticle volume fraction. These nanoparticles are found to be ideal for studying polymer nanocomposites, and a phase diagram constructed on the basis of nanoparticle arrangements is presented. Tethered nanoparticles, in the limit small tethered polymer chains, also serve as model systems for studying the properties of soft nanoparticles. Well-dispersed suspensions of these soft nanoparticles in oligomers exhibit unique properties across the jamming transition, including anomalous structural and dynamic trends typically associated with complex molecular fluids.

Some [...] "neon" [...] tubes are made without phosphor coatings for some of the colors. Clear tubing filled with neon gas produces the ubiquitous yellowish orange color with the interior plasma column clearly visible, and is the cheapest and simplest tube to make. Traditional neon glasses in America over 20 years old are lead glass that are easy to soften in gas fires, but recent environmental and health concerns of the workers has prompted manufacturers to seek more environmentally safe special <b>soft</b> <b>glass</b> formulas. One of the vexing problems avoided this way is lead glass' tendency to burn into a black spot emitting lead fumes in a bending flame too rich in the fuel/oxygen mixture. Another traditional line of glasses was colored soda lime glasses coming in a myriad of glass color choices, which produce the highest quality, most hypnotically vibrant and saturated hues. Still more color choices are afforded in either coating, or not coating, these colored glasses with the various available exotic phosphors.|$|E
