A cyclic load representing a 20 tonne axle load was applied at 3 Hz for at least 3 million cycles, during which measurements of permanent and resilient vertical deflection were made. Certain interventions are found to result in lower rates of permanent settlement and different resilient ranges of movement.

40|$|In the Highlands of Ethiopia, {{soil erosion}} is a {{pressing}} challenge causing deterioration of soil quality including soil fertility. To overcome this problem, {{the government has}} been taking various sustainable land management (SLM) measures. This study was conducted in 2011 to investigate the long-term impacts of soil conservation on soil qualities and crop performance at Anjeni watershed in the central highlands of Ethiopia. Soil and crop samples were collected from the lower (deposition), middle and upper (loss) zones of the terraces at a depth of 30 cm. The test crops were maize (Zea mays) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Soil samples were also taken at toe slope, foot slope, back slope, <b>shoulder</b> <b>slope</b> and crest positions of the watershed from 0 - 30 cm soil depth to evaluate the status of soil qualities along the catena. Results of the study showed that soil pH, exchangeable cations, available phosphorus, sum of exchangeable bases and percent base saturation showed non-significant difference between the loss zone and deposition zones, whereas higher mean value of organic carbon, and total nitrogen were obtained at the deposition zone than the loss zone. For both testing crops, higher mean yields were found at deposition zones followed by the middle zones while the lowest value was obtained from the loss zones. Soil pH, exchangeable cations, available phosphorus, sum of exchangeable bases, percent base saturation, organic carbon and total nitrogen showed significant variation due to slope position differences. Toe slope position followed by crest slope position showed higher mean value of the parameters. The <b>shoulder</b> <b>slope</b> position had the lowest mean value for all parameters. From the results of the study, it was possible to conclude that soil conservation measures implemented at Anjeni watershed reduced soils erosion, improved soil qualities and increased crop yield. It is, therefore, possible to recommend the need for scaling up of results obtained from learning watersheds on soil conservation activities to the highlands of Ethiopia to improve the soil quality and livelihoods’ of the society. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of vegetative buffer strips in intercepting herbicides from surface runoff is well established. A sound buffer design should also facilitate rapid degradation of deposited herbicides {{before they have}} a chance to be released to surface and subsurface flow. Experimental plots were arranged in a split-plot design with three replications and a factorial combination of three land-use treatments with five landscape positions (summit, <b>shoulder</b> <b>slope,</b> back slope, foot slope, and toe slope). Land-use treatments included a contour grass buffer watershed, a contour tree-grass agroforestry buffer watershed, and a control watershed. Watershed areas ranged from 1. 65 to 4. 44 ha. All land-use treatments were in a corn-soybean minimum-till production system, and the vegetative buffers were contoured strips from the summit to toe slope positions. To evaluate microbial activities and herbicide degradation potential, â-glucosidase, dehydrogenase and fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activities were measured.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} road and habitat characteristics associated with black bear-vehicle collisions in Yosemite National Park and to suggest proper mitigations to reduce their occurrence. Black bear-vehicle collision data collected by Yosemite National Park staff between 1995 and 2011 were used to identify variables associated with collisions. Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping software was used to map and split Yosemite roads into 1 km segments. After measuring road and bear habitat-related variables along each road segment, logistic regression analyses showed that segments with collisions were associated with crossing sites, understory vegetation, curves, close proximity to meadows, and a flat outbound <b>shoulder</b> <b>slope.</b> GIS spatial pattern and hot spot analysis were then used to group segments by their relative frequency of collisions: zero, low, moderate, and high. Logistic regression analyses of those same road segments, now grouped by their collision frequency, showed that segments with high frequencies of collisions were associated with a lack of visibility, fewer crossing sites, high understory cover, steep shoulder slopes, and close proximity to human development and meadows. The findings of this study were used to suggest effective and appropriate mitigation strategies for reducing collisions between bears and vehicles...|$|E
40|$|At His Majesty the King of Thailand’s initiative, in 1993 the Department of Highways {{instructed}} its highway {{construction and}} maintenance units to plant vetiver grass {{on the slope}} areas of 113 highways for soil erosion prevention. Over 6. 5 million tillers have been planted, either in rows or in clump patterns in slopy areas, depending on the seriousness and the tendency of erosion. On road slopes where erosion is not severe, tiller planting is done in rows 1 to 2 m apart and in clumps with not more than 10 - 15 cm spacing. On slopes where erosion is severe, tiller planting is done in rows spaced not more than 50 cm and in clump spaced not more than 5 - 8 cm.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2004 Forests, {{soils and}} their {{relationships}} were studied along a toposequence over an elevation range from 161 meters to 213 meters near Smith Lake on the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus, Fairbanks, Alaska. Forest cover type and understory species composition change along the slope {{from top to}} bottom and are related to temperature and moisture. Aspen occurs on the ridge top. Paper birch grows best on the shoulder. White spruce, which has the greatest commercial value, is the only species present on all slope positions; it grows best on shoulder and back slopes. Black spruce dominates on the wet and cold top slope that has a thick organic layer. Organic horizon depth increases, whereas rooting depth decreases, along the toposequence from the <b>shoulder</b> <b>slope</b> to the top slope. Soil textures are mainly silt loam and fine sandy loam with slightly acidic reactions in the surface mineral horizons to calcareous reactions in subsoils.

The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate contour planting as a means to reduce soil erosion on steep slopes of the Columbia Plateau dryland wheat region. An exploratory field study was conducted on a Ritzville silt loam (coarsesilty, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haploxerolls) and 0 - 20 percent slopes. Planting was performed with a deep furrow drill on the contour to a depth of 20 cm.

A contouring algorithm was evaluated in which the direction of a tractor is determined by contour-based neural activity whereby neurons corresponding to regions of the terrain of similar height to that of the tractor’s current position receive the greatest excitatory input. The contour region, therefore, has the global effect of influencing the whole state space to attract the tractor in the right direction.

40|$|Abstract Background Clinicians who {{assess and}} treat {{patients}} for scoliosis typically use parameters {{that are all}} visible from the posterior view. Radiographs assess the internal spinal deformity, but do not directly evaluate body shape, either posterior or anterior. This is problematic, as the patient is most concerned {{about the way they}} appear in the mirror. An objective set of anterior measurements is needed to help quantify the anterior asymmetry that is present in scoliosis. Methods The design of this system of assessment was developed as a consensus of thinking from four points of view. A spine surgeon provided the musculoskeletal structural perspective. A plastic surgeon specializing in breast reconstruction provided the aesthetic and soft tissue perspective. A surface topography researcher provided the imaging perspective, and a scoliosis patient provided the self-perception and emotional perspective. Using an iterative process, a series of potential measurement parameters using surface topography measurements were considered, debated, and ultimately selected {{to be part of a}} system of measurement that provides an overall assessment of anterior trunk asymmetry. Results An anterior surface topography scan in the relaxed, standing position was taken of the scoliosis patient. The computer provides a 3 D topographical model that is used to complete measurements that can be combined to achieve an Anterior Aesthetic Deformity Score. Shoulder parameters, including shoulder height difference and <b>shoulder</b> <b>slope</b> difference, make up 40  % of the total score. Breast asymmetry, including nipple height difference and sternal notch-to-nipple distance, make up 30  % of the total score. Waist asymmetry makes up the final 30  % of the score, providing an objective and quantifiable measure of anterior trunk deformity. Conclusions These measurements provide an objective, systematic evaluation of anterior trunk asymmetry that can be used in the assessment of patients with scoliosis. Clinical research should now be done to validate this system and show that it is reproducible in a variety of settings and patients...|$|E
40|$|Erosion control {{planning}} {{and evaluation of}} spatially distributed erosion models require knowledge of rates of soil loss and sedimentation on different landscape elements and slope positions. A method for obtaining spatially distributed information on sediment movement employing rare earth element (REE) oxides was proposed. The performance of REEs as tracers was tested using a 4 by 4 meter laboratory plot with a silt loam soil and at 10 % slope. Five slope sections were labeled with REE oxides in a powder form. After a series of simulated rainfalls, erosion rates on different slope positions predicted from REE were within 4 to 40 % of the rates calculated using DEMs obtained by a laser scanner. The largest loss occurred on the upper-middle part of the slope. The tracer enrichment ratio was 1. 7. In the field experiment, 6 REEs were used to tag different morphological units of a 0. 68 ha watershed with a silt loam soil and an average gradient of 8 %. Background concentrations of REEs in the soil were characterized by a uniform spatial distribution with coefficient of variation of less than 7 %. To quantify the mean background value of REE in the soil with an allowable error of 5 % at a 95 % confidence level, 10 random, independent samples were needed. While the average soil loss on the watershed {{during the time of}} the experiment was 6. 1 t ha− 1, local rates varied between 46 t ha− 1 of loss to 50 t ha− 1 of soil gain due to deposition. While landscape elements with convergent flow experienced considerable deposition, these areas also had the greatest net soil loss, indicating a great turnover of sediment. The <b>shoulder</b> <b>slope</b> with lesser slope gradients remained relatively stable, and net deposition occurred on the toeslope area adjacent to the outlet of the watershed. The multiple REE tracing technique offers a simple and a precise way of tracing soil movement, identifying multiple sources and sinks of sediments, and determining net soil losses at various locations on the watershed. ...|$|E
40|$|Transition between slope {{positions}} (e. g., ridge, <b>shoulder</b> <b>slope,</b> back slope, foot slope, and valley) {{is often}} gradual. Quantification of spatial transitions or spatial gradations between slope positions {{can increase the}} accuracy of terrain parameterization for geographical or ecological modeling, especially for digital soil mapping at a fine scale. Current models for characterizing the spatial gradation of slope positions based on a gridded DEM either focus solely on the parameter space or depend on too many rules defined by topographic attributes, which makes such approaches impractical. The typical locations of a slope position contain {{the characteristics of the}} slope position in both parameter space and spatial context. Thus, the spatial gradation of slope positions can be quantified by comparing terrain characteristics (spatial and parametrical) of given locations to those at typical locations. Based on this idea, this paper proposes an approach to quantifying the spatial gradation of slope positions by using typical locations as prototypes. This approach includes two parts: the first is to extract the typical locations of each slope position and treat them as the prototypes of this position; and the second is to compute the similarity between a given location and the prototypes based on both local topographic attributes and spatial context. The new approach characterizes slope position gradation in both the attribute domain (i. e., parameter space) and the spatial domain (i. e., geographic space) in an easy and practicable way. Applications show that the new approach can quantitatively describe spatial gradations among a set of slope positions. Comparison of spatial gradation of A-horizon sand percentages with the quantified spatial gradation of slope positions indicates that the latter reflects slope processes, confirming the effectiveness of the approach. The comparison of a soil subgroup map of the study area with the maximum similarity map derived from the approach also suggests that the quantified spatial gradation of slope position can be used to aid geographical modeling such as digital soil mapping.
