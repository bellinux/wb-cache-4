5000|$|To {{save the}} {{prediction}} graph over flash memory with overheads (SRAM capacity) minimized, the subsequent LBA information of each regular node is saved at the <b>spare</b> <b>area</b> of the corresponding page. It is because that the <b>spare</b> <b>area</b> of a page in current implementations has unused space, and {{the reading of}} a page usually comes with the reading of its data and spare areas simultaneously. In such a way, the accessing of the subsequent LBA information of a regular node comes with no extra cost. Since a branch node {{has more than one}} subsequent LBA’s, the <b>spare</b> <b>area</b> of the corresponding page might not have enough free space to store the information. Thus, a branch table is maintained to save the subsequent LBA information of all branch nodes. The starting entry address of the branch table that corresponds to a branch node can be saved at the <b>spare</b> <b>area</b> of the corresponding page. The starting entry records the number of subsequent LBA’s of the branch node, and the subsequent LBA’s are stored in the entries following the starting entry. The branch table can be saved on flash memory. During the run time, the entire table can be loaded into SRAM for better performance. If there is not enough SRAM space, parts of the table can be loaded in an [...] fashion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{flash memory}} has many {{advantages}} such as low power consumption, strong shock resistance, fast I/O and non-volatility. And {{it is increasingly}} used in the mobile storage device. The YAFFS, one of the NAND flash file system, is widely used in the embedded device. However, the existing YAFFS takes long time to mount the file system because it scans whole <b>spare</b> <b>areas</b> in all pages of NAND flash memory. In order to solve this problem, we propose a new content-based flash file system using a mounting time reduction technique. The proposed method only scans partial <b>spare</b> <b>areas</b> of some special pages by using content-based block management.

50|$|There is {{no special}} {{procedure}} to initialize a YAFFS filesystem beyond simply erasing the flash memory. When a bad block is encountered, YAFFS follows the smart media scheme of marking the fifth byte of the block's <b>spare</b> <b>area.</b> Blocks marked as such remain unallocated from then on.|$|E
50|$|To write file data, YAFFS {{initially}} {{writes a}} whole page (chunk in YAFFS terminology) {{that describes the}} file metadata, such as timestamps, name, path, etc. The new file is assigned a unique object ID number; every data chunk within the file will contain this unique object ID within the <b>spare</b> <b>area.</b> YAFFS maintains a tree structure in RAM memory of the physical location of these chunks. When a chunk is no longer valid (the file is deleted, or parts of the file are overwritten), YAFFS marks a particular byte in the <b>spare</b> <b>area</b> of the chunk as ‘dirty’. When an entire block (32 pages) is marked as dirty, YAFFS can erase the block and reclaim the space. When the filesystem's free space is low, YAFFS consolidates a group of good pages onto a new block. YAFFS then reclaims the space used by dirty pages {{within each of the}} original blocks.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper proposes an {{innovative}} approach {{to cope with}} defects in SRAM bit-cell array. Traditional approaches use spare parts (rows, columns or blocks) to replace defective bit-cells. Instead of replacing defective bit-cells, we propose to operate the SRAM with reduced storage capacity whenever defective bit-cells are present. We implement this feature through a programmable combinational logic, called Scrambling Module (SM), which scrambles the memory addresses. The scrambling changes the addresses of the defective bit-cells, grouping them in an idle address zone located {{at the end of}} the memory address plan. The SM is described by using a mathematical formulation based on linear algebra. The proposed technique can be used in combination with traditional redundancy approaches using spare rows and/or columns. The effectiveness of three different SM is demonstrated, considering a 1 MBit SRAM. For a given level of defect tolerance, it is shown that our technique can reduce the amount of <b>spare</b> <b>area</b> by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, as the SM is implemented as an external block, it does not affect the maximum operation frequency of the SRAM. Instead, it affects the memory access delay...|$|E

30|$|IS {{has been}} {{described}} in various interstitial lung diseases, ARDS, pneumonia and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema [113 – 121]. Often, {{the location of the}} B-lines does not follow gravitational rules in many of these conditions. The pleural line may appear thickened and fragmented, some <b>spared</b> <b>areas</b> may be devoid of B-lines, and subpleural consolidations may be seen [113, 115, 117, 119, 134 – 136]. In other cases of pulmonary oedema from fluid overload and renal failure, the LUS findings will be similar to those of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema [114, 116, 120, 121, 134 – 136]. Hence, when IS is detected, supplementary focused echocardiography can be employed in order to establish whether the IS is of cardiogenic origin or not [121]. Even though LUS has a high sensitivity for the detection of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, CT still has a higher sensitivity for the detection of many of the conditions causing non-cardiogenic IS, especially interstitial lung disease. Hence a LUS with normal findings cannot be used to rule out conditions such as interstitial lung disease, and supplementary CT should still be considered since it has a pivotal role in diagnosing, staging and monitoring of these diseases [137].|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{development}} of flash memory technology, NAND flash has been widely used as a storage device in portable embedded systems, personal computers, and enterprise systems. However, flash memory is prone to performance degradation due to the long latency in flash program operations and flash erasure operations. One common technique for hiding long program latency {{is to use a}} temporal buffer to hold write data. Although DRAM is often used to implement the buffer because of its high performance and low bit cost, it is volatile; thus, that the data may be lost on power failure in the storage system. As a solution to this issue, recent operating systems frequently issue flush commands to force storage devices to permanently move data from the buffer into the non-volatile area. However, the excessive use of flush commands may worsen the write performance of the storage systems. In this paper, we propose two data loss recovery techniques that require fewer write operations to flash memory. These techniques remove unnecessary flash writes by storing storage metadata along with user data simultaneously by utilizing the <b>spare</b> <b>area</b> associated with each data page...|$|E
40|$|Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review {{discusses}} {{the role of}} chest ultrasound in diagnosis and management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) {{and the most recent}} technical progresses in this field. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinically, suspected ARDS can be easily confirmed by lung ultrasonography through the recognition of a typical pattern characterized by B-lines, <b>spared</b> <b>areas,</b> pleural line thickening, and subpleural consolidations. A visual score based on number and thickness of B-lines permits a semiquantitative evaluation of the amount of extravascular lung water and lung density. Recently, a quantitative lung ultrasound method has been proposed. The heart may be also involved in ARDS either primarily or by the application of positive pressure ventilation. The incidence of acute cor pulmonale during ARDS is, even if under protective ventilation, not negligible. The use of echocardiography combined with lung ultrasound is important for early detection of cor pulmonale, identification of the best ventilator strategy to preserve heart-to-lung interaction, and prediction of weaning success. SUMMARY: An ultrasound-integrated approach combining lung ultrasound and echocardiography should be recommended as a suitable technique to manage ARDS during diagnosis, mechanical ventilation setting, and weanin...|$|R

Aberrant levels of gephyrin, a post-synaptic receptor-stabilizing protein, could affect the inhibitory modulation of excitatory impulses. We assayed gephyrin protein in two brain areas susceptible to neuronal loss in AD, and in a <b>spared</b> <b>area,</b> in autopsy tissue from normal subjects (n = 15) and AD patients (n = 15). Quantification was by in-gel immunodetection against known concentrations of a recombinant truncated gephyrin standard. Gephyrin abundance was significantly reduced (P < 0. 01) in AD. Area-wise analysis showed that gephyrin levels were reduced in both spared and susceptible regions, indicating a global phenomenon. When samples were categorized on an index of pathological severity, gephyrin levels decreased with increasing severity until a moderate index was reached, and then increased, suggesting that higher gephyrin levels might compensate for excitotoxic damage in late stages of the disease. AD males showed a more pronounced reduction in gephyrin levels than AD females cf same-sex controls. A major splice variant of gephyrin was detected in all cases and in all three brain areas.
