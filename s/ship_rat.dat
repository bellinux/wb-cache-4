40|$|Summary: Poison {{was used}} at remote {{anchorages}} of southern Stewart Island {{in spring and}} summer of 1984 / 85 to reduce the likelihood of <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> (Rattus rattus), Norway rats (R. norvegicus) and kiore (R. exulans) boarding fishing boats heading for the Snares Islands. Poison baits were removed at successively slower rates, probably because poisoning had reduced rat numbers. The effectiveness of poisoning was tested by (i) live-capturing and tracking marked rats at a simulated anchorage near Halfmoon Bay, (ii) poisoning there as in southern Stewart Island, and (Hi) monitoring the survival and responses of the marked population. Population density approximated 2. 0 - 2. 5 <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> per hectare before poisoning. The minimum monthly home range of <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> averaged 0. 54 ha (mean range length 142 m), which is much larger than previously recorded for <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> in New Zealand. Neither Norway <b>rats</b> nor <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> were restricted to the shoreline or along creeks. Poisoning caused a 93 % reduction in an index of rat numbers in a 0. 69 ha poisoning zone over 16 days, and a 76 % reduction over the larger 10. 4 ha effective trapping area including the poison zone. Poisoning reduces the risk of rats boarding boats, and can protect endangered plants and animals on infested islands...|$|R

Norway rats were most common in subalpine shrubland and Pacific rats dominated in manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) shrubland.

Pacific rats showed a significant positive relationship with increasing amounts of the ground cover wire rush, (Empodisma minus). Reasons for the observed habitat use on Stewart Island could include physiological adaptation to cold and wet conditions in Norway rats; the avoidance of predation or inter-specific competition by Pacific rats; and possibly preference for more structurally complex vegetation types by <b>ship</b> <b>rats.</b> ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The kukupa or New Zealand pigeon (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) is {{gradually}} declining on the New Zealand mainland, due mostly to predation by introduced pest mammals including <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> (Rattus rattus) and brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). We {{report on a}} co-operative project between Maori landowners, the Department of Conservation, and Manaaki Whenua–Landcare Research researchers to restore a Northland kukupa population and to examine kukupa nesting success in relation to pest abundance. <b>Ship</b> <b>rats</b> and possums were targeted by trapping and poisoning throughout Motatau Forest (350 ha) from 1997 to 1999; only possums were targeted in 2000. All 13 kukupa nests located before pest control started in late 1997 failed at the egg stage, but all seven nests located in 1998 – 99 successfully fledged young when trapping and tracking indices of possums and <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> were less than 4 %. After pest control, counts of kukupa and some other bird species increased at Motatau compared with counts in a nearby non-treatment block, suggesting numbers of adult kukupa can be increased in small forest areas by intensive pest control. This increase is due at least partly to increased nest success. Evidence from time-lapse video cameras, sign remaining at nests, and nest success rates under different pest control regimes suggest both <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> and possums are important predators at kukupa nests. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

With warfarin-resistnat and non-resistant common rats, complete kills were obtained using a concentration of 0 - 0005 % for 2 days, or 0 - 001 % for 1 day: a 1 -day test at 0 - 0005 % killed 6 out of 10 and 17 out of 20 of the two types respectively. At 0 - 0005 % complete kills of resistant <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> were obtained after 2 days exposure and of resistant house mice after 1 day, but at 0 - 002 % for 2 days there was some survival. Non-resistant <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> and house mice were all killed after 2 days feeding on 0 - 002 % bait. In 2 -day palatability tests, R. norvegicus showed no significant aversion to the poison at 0 - 002 % and 100 % mortality was obtained. The poison was significantly unpalatable to R. rattus at 0 - 005 % and to M. musculus at 0 - 005 % and 0 - 002 %, although with the last species these concentrations gave complete kills. It is concluded that WBA 8119 has greater activity than other known anticoagulants against the three commensal species examined. The laboratory results suggest that concentrations between 0 - 0005 % and 0 - 002 % would be suitable for field use against common rats, and between 0 - 002 % and 0 - 005 % for <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> and house mice...|$|R

50|$|The {{breeding}} {{season of the}} Uvea parakeet is from August to January. The nests are located in natural cavities in native trees, with Syzygium and Mimusops accounting for 90% of nesting trees. Three (occasionally two) eggs are laid in these cavities and incubated for 21 days. The nestling period is around 43 days, {{with an average of}} around 1.5 chicks being fledged per nesting attempt. Fledging survival is lower, however, with around 0.75 chicks surviving a month after fledging. The main causes of chick mortality are starvation (most common in the smallest, weakest chick), brown goshawk predation and human collecting (for the pet trade). It once ranged across the other Loyalty Islands; attempts to reintroduce it to Lifou in 1925 and 1963 failed. One source reports that the reintroduced birds simply flew back to Uvea. Studies of potential nesting success on the two islands showed that future reintroductions to Lifou would fail unless the <b>ship</b> <b>rat</b> population is controlled. It is threatened by habitat loss and the pet trade. Around 30-50% of its habitat has been lost in the last thirty years. Collection for the pet trade not only reduces the number of birds but the collection method, which involves cutting trees open to get at the chicks, renders the nesting sites useless for future breeding attempts and lack of breeding cavities may be limiting the population. In the event that ship rats were to reach Uvea it would be at greater risk of extinction. The parakeet is listed in Appendix I of CITES and the IUCN considers the conservation status as endangered. This species is threatened because of low numbers, a limited home range and habitat loss. However, in recent years, community involvement in saving the species have contributed to significant gains in increasing the Ouvea parakeet population from an estimated 617 in 1993 to 2,090 in 2009.|$|E

Eighty-one ship rats {{were caught in}} an effective trapping area of 12. 4 ha. Extinction trapping gave an estimated density of 6. 7 rats ha- 1 (6. 5 - 7. 8 rats ha- 1, 95 % confidence intervals). A linear relationship existed between <b>ship</b> <b>rat</b> trapping and tracking rates. Estimating the density of mice was impossible because trapping rates increased rather than decreased during the experiment. Comparisons of density from tracking and trapping rates of mice may be confounded by interference by rats, but this requires further investigation. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E

40|$|Control {{operations}} for invasive <b>ship</b> <b>rats,</b> Rattus rattus, in New Zealand forests are often followed by increased house mouse, Mus musculus, detections suggesting rats suppress mice. A potential mechanism is intraguild predation, either by interference competition or as simple predatory behaviour. If aggression by rats towards mice is mainly competitive, it should include threat and display features associated with, for example, intraspecific fighting. If predatory, it should lack these features and {{be associated with}} feeding. In {{the first of two}} captive experiments we observed interactions between paired, live rodents, either side of a wire-mesh screen, and found that most rats were aggressive to mice. This aggression lacked threat and display characteristics typical of encounters with conspecifics and was rarely reciprocated by mice. In a second experiment, euthanized mice were drawn by a line through cages occupied by rats fed either a restricted or unrestricted diet. Rats of both groups attacked and restrained the euthanized mice, and all rats that interacted with the mice ate at least part of them, although food-restricted rats tended to eat more. As the aggressive response of <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> towards mice lacked threat and display features and was related to feeding, we conclude that it resembles predatory behaviour. Our findings provide {{a better understanding of the}} interactions between <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> and house mice, which hinder their management where they coexist as damaging invaders.

The most frequent prey were three introduced mammals (house mice Mus musculus, <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> Rattus rattus and rabbits Sylvilagus sp.) and the thin-billed prion Pachyptila belcheri (each season present on ca. 21 % of the analysed scats). These represent the Wrst systematic data on feral cat diet for the Falklands. A simple bioenergetics model suggests that cats could be eating {{in the region of}} 1, 500 – 11, 000 prions per season, representing < 1 % of the local adult and subadult population. Predation on other seabirds nesting on New Island (several penguin species, albatrosses and cormorants) was unimportant, {{with the possible exception of}} white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis, which nest locally in very small numbers.

Despite the importance of this event in the conservation history of New Zealand, and subsequent major advances in rodent eradication and biosecurity, the source and pathway of the rat {{invasion of}} Big South Cape Island has never been identified. Using modern molecular methods on contemporary and historical tissue samples, we identify the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype of ship rats (Rattus rattus) on Big South Cape Island and compare it to that of ship rats in the neighbouring regions of Stewart Island/Rakiura and southern New Zealand, all hypothesised as possible source sites for the invasion.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of an investigation into invertebrate predation by introduced small mammals and the population dynamics of the <b>ship</b> <b>rat</b> and stoat in lowland podocarp forest. The study area was Okarito Forest, South Westland, New Zealand. The invertebrate faunas of four study sites were compared using pitfall traps and found to be similar, justifying the assumption that small mammals trapped within any of these sites would have access to a similar range of invertebrate food items. Drainage was found {{to be the most important}} environmental variable influencing invertebrate distribution. Diet of the stoat, <b>ship</b> <b>rat</b> and possum were investigated using gut contents obtained from animals trapped between June 1994 and February 1995. The diet of stoats during 1994 / 95 included a much larger invertebrate component than expected (close to 50 % of volume). It is proposed that this is due to stoats switching to invertebrates in a year of low rat abundance. Stoats appeared to selectively consume freshwater crayfish and the weta, Gymnoplectron sp [...] Other invertebrates made up an insignificant part of stoat diet. Invertebrates predominated in <b>ship</b> <b>rat</b> diet. It is proposed that ship rats are not foraging in a particularly selective manner, but consume invertebrates in relation to size and availability. Invertebrates made up a small but significant part of possum diet. Large invertebrates were apparently preferred and possums were found to selectively consume large invertebrates in times of increased abundance or activity. As a result of a study of population dynamics, utilising trapping and autopsy information from previous years, a system very similar to that described for New Zealand's beech forests is proposed. In the majority of years Okarito Forest is thought to provide at best a marginal habitat for the <b>ship</b> <b>rat.</b> However a rimu mast year leads to increased rat abundance, which in turn results in increased stoat numbers. Data indicates that the trapping season of 1993 / 94 was a mast year and that of this study (1994 / 95) a crash year. Although this study does not provide enough data to determine the effects of predation on the invertebrate fauna, some general comments are made regarding invertebrate conservation and the effects of mammalian predation on the invertebrate fauna of mainland New Zealand...|$|E

Home ranges of six females and five males averaged 0. 86 ha in area and 174 minlength, with {{no significant difference}} in range area or length between males and females. There was substantial overlap in ranges between and within sexes. One adult male increased the size of his range more than four-fold in seven nights in late October, coinciding with the beginning of the breeding season. Some rats changed daytime den sites frequently and others used the same den for a number of consecutive days; rats were found sharing dens on many occasions. Most rats returned to previously-used dens after denning elsewhere. At night, rats spent most of their time active on or close to the ground. There are a number of important differences between our findings and those from other studies of <b>ship</b> <b>rats</b> in New Zealand; we suggest that the different times of year at which the studies were carried out are responsible for some of these differences.
