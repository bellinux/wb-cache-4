25|$|Swing {{moorings}} {{also known}} as simple or single-point moorings, are the simplest and most common kind of mooring. A swing mooring consists of a <b>single</b> <b>anchor</b> {{at the bottom of}} a waterway with a rode (a rope, cable, or chain) running to a float on the surface. The float allows a vessel to find the rode and connect to the anchor. These anchors are known as swing moorings because a vessel attached to this kind of mooring swings in a circle when the direction of wind or tide changes.|$|E
25|$|On 25 January 1824 Columbine wrecked on Sapientza Island, {{which is}} off the {{southern}} coast of the Peloponnese, {{near the city of}} Methóni. She had sailed from Corfu on 15 January and had arrived at the island on 19 January. Abbott initially went on shore to conduct a survey of the harbour and anchored her off Port Longue. On the night of the 24th, the weather worsened and her <b>single</b> <b>anchor</b> did not hold her securely, with the result that she drove onto a reef and foundered. All her crew survived, having clambered onto the rocks. The subsequent court martial reprimanded Abbott and the master, James Atkinson, for having used only one anchor and for not having prepared for the eventuality of bad weather.|$|E

The icebreakers were used to assist the raising and lowering of the SALM buoy and the beginning and end of the production season, and to support loading operations together with other icebreaking vessels until the ice conditions became too severe. The management of Smit Sibu was transferred to the Russian company FEMCO Management in 2006 and, after having been relieved by her sister ship, headed to Singapore for conversion to a dedicated stand-by vessel at Keppel Tuas shipyard. Her ownership was transferred to FEMCO in 2009 and she was given back her original name, Ikaluk, in 2012.|$|E

25|$|On the {{strength}} of his climbs in the Alps, Lafaille was invited on an expedition to Annapurna by Pierre Béghin, one of the leading French climbers of the day. The pair attempted the mountain's vast South Face following the monsoon season in October 1991 in Alpine style, with no Sherpa support, pre-stocked campsites or fixed ropes on the upper mountain. They had reached a height of 7,400 metres when bad weather forced them to descend. The pair made a series of abseils down the face, but due to their lightweight approach they had little protective equipment and were often forced to abseil from a <b>single</b> <b>anchor</b> to conserve equipment. On the fourth or fifth abseil, Beghin fell to his death when the single cam he was using as an anchor became dislodged from the rock. Beghin had been carrying most of the pair's technical equipment, including all the ropes, and Lafaille was left alone on the face, a vertical mile above safety.|$|E

500|$|On 4 February 1999, New Carissa {{was bound}} for the Port of Coos Bay {{to pick up a}} load of wood chips. The ship's crew was {{informed}} by the local bar pilots that weather conditions would prevent the ship (which was empty at the time) from entering Coos Bay harbor until the next morning. The captain ordered the ship to drop anchor [...] off the coast in order to ride out the storm. The crew used a <b>single</b> <b>anchor</b> to secure the ship. According to a United States Coast Guard review of the incident, the chain used was too short. The short chain and the weather conditions, including winds of , caused the ship to drag her anchor. Poor navigational techniques and inadequate watchkeeping led to the crew's failure to notice that the ship was moving. Once movement was detected, the crew attempted to raise anchor and maneuver away from the shore, but the weather and sea conditions made this difficult. By the time the anchor was raised, the ship had been pushed too close to the shore to recover.|$|E

The variation of the uplift factors Fc, Fq and Fy, due to the contributions of soil cohesion, surcharge pressure and unit weight, respectively, has been evaluated for different combinations of S/B and H/B. As compared to <b>single</b> isolated <b>anchor,</b> the group of two anchors generates significantly greater magnitude of Fc for Φ ≤ 20 ° especially with greater values of H/B and under fully bonded anchor-soil interface condition. The factor Fc attains almost the maximum value when the upper anchor plate is placed midway between ground surface and the lower anchor plate. The factors Fq and Fy, on the other hand, for a group of two anchors are found to remain almost equal to that of a <b>single</b> isolated <b>anchor</b> as long as the levels of the lower plate in the group and the <b>single</b> isolated <b>anchor</b> are kept the same...|$|R

Among the options for repairs with synthetic devices is anatomic reconstruction with a double tunnel in the clavicle {{as well as in}} the coracoid [5]. This technique allows the conoid and trapezoid ligaments to be emulated, and has shown biomechanical advantages [12], but there is also an increased risk of fracture of the clavicle during the construction of two tunnels and an increase in technical difficulty [5]. On the other hand, the isometric approach seeks to restore the anatomy of the conoid and trapezoid ligaments by using a <b>single</b> <b>anchoring</b> stitch in the coracoid at the midway point of the insertion of both ligaments.|$|R

Sail was shortened as we came in, and the ship made a flying moor; after which we lay as securely, at if actually in some basin wrought by art. It is my opinion, the vessel would have ridden out the hardest gale, or anything short of a hurricane, at <b>single</b> <b>anchor,</b> in that place.

60|$|A {{few hours}} later Mabel Dunham was on the bastion that {{overlooked}} {{the river and the}} lake, seemingly in deep thought. The evening was calm and soft, and the question had arisen whether the party for the Thousand Islands {{would be able to get}} out that night or not, on account of the total absence of wind. The stores, arms, and ammunition were already shipped, and even Mabel's effects were on board; but the small draft of men that was to go was still ashore, there being no apparent prospect of the cutter's getting under way. Jasper had warped the Scud out of the cove, and so far up the stream as to enable him to pass through the outlet of the river whenever he chose; but there he still lay, riding at <b>single</b> <b>anchor.</b> The drafted men were lounging about the shore of the cove, undecided whether or not to pull off.|$|E
60|$|The ship lay at a <b>single</b> <b>anchor,</b> well {{outside the}} pier of Leith, {{so that all}} we {{passengers}} must come to it by the means of skiffs. This was very little troublesome, {{for the reason that}} the day was a flat calm, very frosty and cloudy, and with a low shifting fog upon the water. The body of the vessel was thus quite hid as I drew near, but the tall spars of her stood high and bright in a sunshine like the flickering of a fire. She proved to be a very roomy, commodious merchant, but somewhat blunt in the bows, and loaden extraordinary deep with salt, salted salmon, and fine white linen stockings for the Dutch. Upon my coming on board, the captain welcomed me, one Sang (out of Lesmahago, I believe), a very hearty, friendly tarpauling of a man, but at the moment in rather of a bustle.

She was boarded by the castaways, breakfast was served, the baggage slung on board and piled in the waist, and all hands turned to upon the rigging. All day the work continued, the two crews rivalling each other in expense of strength. Dinner was served on deck, the officers messing aft under the slack of the spanker, the men fraternising forward. Trent appeared in excellent spirits, served out grog to all hands, opened a bottle of Cape wine for the after-table, and obliged his guests with many details {{of the life of}} a financier in Cardiff.

3000|$|Two anchors {{are placed}} in each column {{specimen}} and loaded in shear simultaneously. The test anchors were made from 19 -mm [¾-in.] diameter ASTM A 193 Grade B 7 threaded rods. The net shear area ([...] A_sa, [...] V) for the threaded rods was 2.2  cm 2 [0.334  in. 2]. Each test anchor, if fully developed, has an ultimate shear capacity ([...] V_u) of 117  kN [26.4 kips]. Two <b>single</b> <b>anchors,</b> one installed {{on each side of}} the RC column, were loaded simultaneously to eliminate the torsion to the column. The test anchor had an embedded length ([...] h_ef) of 203  mm [8  in.], and located at the middle of the column side faces. With this configuration, one anchor would have a front edge distance of 138  mm [5.4  in.] while the other 167  mm [6.6  in.], as shown in Fig.  3. This difference in the front edge distance was expected to create small behavioral difference because of the anchor shear reinforcement placed near the test anchors.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} plasma-mediated coatings, {{containing}} silver nanoparticles embedded in an organosilicon or silica-like matrix, were deposited onto stainless steel and chemically characterized. Their anti-adhesive properties were evaluated in vitro towards Escherichia coli by performing shear-flow induced detachment experiments. Increasing the wall shear stress facilitated E. coli cell detachment, {{irrespective of the}} coating characteristics. When nanosilver was incorporated, cell detachment was lower, {{probably due to the}} affinity of the embedded silver for biological components of the cell wall. The presence of methyl groups in the matrix network could also promote enhanced hydrophobic interactions. Within the population fraction remaining attached to the coating under increasing shear flow, different association phenotypes were observed, viz. progressively lying flat, moving laterally, remaining tethered, or rotating by a <b>single</b> <b>anchoring</b> point, until alignment with the flow direction. This re-orientation phenotype and its relation with detachment were dependent of the coating. The effects of such heterogeneities should be more deeply explored...|$|R

The land set bounds to its limits in a huge crescent, disappearing in distance towards the south-east and the north. Far {{as the eye could}} reach, nothing but forest was visible, not even a solitary sign of civilization breaking in upon the uniform and grand magnificence of nature.

The captain had no other business there than to take on board the wayfarers, and to renew his supply of fresh meat and vegetables; things of so familiar import on shore as to be seldom thought of until missed, but which swell into importance during a passage of a month's duration. Eve had employed her three days of probation quite usefully, having, {{with the exception of}} the two gentlemen, the officers of the vessel, and one other person, been in quiet possession of all the ample, not to say luxurious cabins. It is true, she had a female attendant; but to her she had been accustomed from childhood, and Nanny Sidley, as her quondam nurse and actual lady's-maid was termed, appeared so much a part of herself, that, while her absence would be missed almost as greatly as that of a limb, her presence was as much a matter of course as a hand or foot.

60|$|Thus far Mark {{had been}} working under a species of excitement, that was {{probably}} natural enough to his situation, but which wanted the coolness and discretion {{that are necessary to}} render our efforts the most profitable to ourselves, or to others. Now, that the feverish feeling which set him at work so early to make a provision against wants which, at the worst, were merely problematical, had subsided, Mark began to see that there remained many things to do, which were of even more pressing necessity than anything yet done. Among the first of these there was the perfect security of the ship. So long as she rode at a <b>single</b> <b>anchor,</b> she could not be considered as absolutely safe; for a shift of wind would cause her to swing against the 'sea-wall,' as he called the natural breakwater outside of her, where, if not absolutely wrecked, she might receive material damage. Prudence required, therefore, that the ship should be moored, as well as anchored. Nevertheless, there was a good deal of truth in what Mark had said touching the plants growing while he and Bob were busy at other matters; and this thought, of itself, formed a sufficient justification for what he had just done, much as it had been done under present excitement. As they under the shade of the royal, our mariners discussed these matters, and matured some plans for the future.|$|E

40|$|Soil anchors are {{commonly}} used as foundation systems for structures requiring uplift resistance such as transmission towers, or for structures requiring lateral resistance, such as sheet pile walls. Anchors commonly {{have more than one}} plate or bearing element and therefore there is a complex interaction between adjacent plates due to overlapping stress zones.
