50|$|Shuttle Kilns: {{this is a}} car-bottom kiln with a door on one or both ends. Burners are {{positioned}} top and bottom on each side, creating a turbulent circular air flow. This type of kiln is generally a multi-car design and is used for processing whitewares, technical ceramics and refractories in batches. Depending upon size and mass of ware, shuttle kilns may be equipped with car moving devices to transfer fired and unfired ware {{in and out of}} the kiln. Shuttle kilns can be either updraft or downdraft in design. A <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Kiln</b> derives its name from the fact that kiln cars can enter a <b>shuttle</b> <b>kiln</b> from either end of the kiln for processing, whereas a tunnel kiln has flow in only one direction.|$|E

The firing simulation research results can provide enterprises with an important basis of some numerical and theoretical analysis.

Production of 20 tons of coke in a small <b>shuttle</b> <b>kiln</b> is near completion which will provide experience for this design. Twenty tons of CTC continuous coke are being produced for testing at a General Motors` foundry. The production is approximately 75 percent complete. During this production, variables of the process are being studied to aid in design of a commercial coke plant. Raw material composition, blending, briquetting variables, and calcining heat profile are the major areas of interest. Western SynCoal Company produces a dried coal product from sub-bituminous coal. This upgraded product was evaluated for producing coke products by blending char from this coal product with the coal product along with suitable binders. The green briquettes were then calcined to produce coke. The resulting coke was judged to be usable {{as part of a}} cupola coke charge or as a fuel in cement kilns and sugar beet furnaces...|$|E
