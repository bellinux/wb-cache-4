5|$|Astronomers {{are searching}} for exoplanets of stars in {{globular}} <b>star</b> <b>clusters.</b>|$|E
5|$|No known {{globular}} clusters display active star formation, {{which is consistent}} with the view that {{globular clusters}} are typically the oldest objects in the Galaxy, and were among the first collections of stars to form. Very large regions of star formation known as super <b>star</b> <b>clusters,</b> such as Westerlund 1 in the Milky Way, may be the precursors of globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|A multi-star system {{consists}} {{of two or more}} gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> also exist. These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E

5000|$|There is some {{equivocation}} {{in the use}} of the identifiers NGC 2174 and NGC 2175. These {{may apply}} to the entire nebula, to its brightest knot, or to the <b>star</b> <b>cluster</b> it includes. Burnham's Celestial Handbook lists the entire nebula as 2174/2175 and does not mention the <b>star</b> <b>cluster.</b> [...] The NGC Project (working from the original descriptive notes) assigns NGC 2174 to the prominent knot at J2000 , [...] and NGC 2175 to the entire nebula, and by extension to the <b>star</b> <b>cluster.</b> [...] Simbad uses NGC 2174 for the nebula and NGC 2175 for the <b>star</b> <b>cluster.</b>|$|R

5|$|Ages for <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> can be {{estimated}} by comparing the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram for the cluster with theoretical models of stellar evolution. Using this technique, ages for the Pleiades of between 75 and 150 million years have been estimated. The wide spread in estimated ages {{is a result of}} uncertainties in stellar evolution models, which include factors such as convective overshoot, in which a convective zone within a star penetrates an otherwise non-convective zone, resulting in higher apparent ages.|$|E
5|$|In the Local Supercluster it is {{possible}} to see <b>star</b> <b>clusters,</b> and current telescopes could in principle observe faint individual stars in the Local Group (see Cepheids). However, outside the Local Supercluster of galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been observed. The only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years—ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way {{passes through}} much of Canis Minor, yet it has few deep-sky objects. William Herschel {{recorded}} four objects in his 1786 work Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars, including two he mistakenly believed were <b>star</b> <b>clusters.</b> NGC 2459 {{is a group of}} five thirteenth- and fourteenth-magnitude stars that appear to lie close together in the sky but are not related. A similar situation has occurred with NGC 2394, also in Canis Minor. This is a collection of fifteen unrelated stars of ninth-magnitude and fainter.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{supermassive black}} hole, a gaseous {{accretion}} disk and compact <b>star</b> <b>cluster</b> {{in the center}} of active galactic nuclei, as known today. So the activity of AGN can be represented as the result of interaction of these three subsystems. In this work we investigate the dynamical interaction of a central <b>star</b> <b>cluster</b> surrounding a supermassive black hole and a central accretion disk. The dissipative force acting on stars in the disk leads to an asymmetry in the phase space distribution of the central <b>star</b> <b>cluster</b> due to the rotating accretion disk. In our work we present some results of Stardisk model, where we see some changes in density and phase space of central <b>star</b> <b>cluster</b> due to influence of rotating gaseous accretion disk...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the dynamical {{evolution of a}} unique type of dark <b>star</b> <b>cluster</b> model in which {{the majority of the}} cluster mass at Hubble time is dominated by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). We analyzed results from about 2000 <b>star</b> <b>cluster</b> models (Survey Database I) simulated using the Monte-Carlo code MOCCA and identified these dark <b>star</b> <b>cluster</b> models. Taking one of these models, we apply the method of simulating realistic "mock observations" by utilizing the COCOA and SISCO codes to obtain the photometric and kinematic observational properties of the dark <b>star</b> <b>cluster</b> model at 12 Gyr. We find that the perplexing Galactic globular cluster NGC 6535 closely matches the observational photometric and kinematic properties of the dark <b>star</b> <b>cluster</b> model presented in this paper. Based on our analysis and currently observed properties of NGC 6535, we suggest that this globular cluster could potentially harbour an IMBH. If it exists, the presence of this IMBH can be detected robustly with proposed kinematic observations of NGC 6535. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables, Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} observe {{a variety of}} {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety of}} deep-sky objects such as <b>star</b> <b>clusters,</b> galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{astronomy}} {{is founded}} on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host <b>star</b> <b>clusters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Medieval Islamic astronomers gave Arabic {{names to}} many stars {{that are still}} used today and they invented {{numerous}} astronomical instruments that could compute {{the positions of the}} stars. They built the first large observatory research institutes, mainly for the purpose of producing Zij star catalogues. Among these, the Book of Fixed Stars (964) was written by the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, who observed a number of stars, <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> (including the Omicron Velorum and Brocchi's Clusters) and galaxies (including the Andromeda Galaxy). According to A. Zahoor, in the 11th century, the Persian polymath scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni described the Milky Way galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties of nebulous stars, and also gave the latitudes of various stars during a lunar eclipse in 1019.|$|E

5|$|The {{distances}} to <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> {{can be estimated}} by using a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram or colour–colour diagram to calibrate the absolute magnitudes of the stars, for example fitting the main sequence or identifying features such as a horizontal branch, and hence their distance from Earth. It is also necessary to know the amount of interstellar extinction to the cluster and this can be difficult in regions such as the Carina Nebula. A distance of 7,330light-years (2,250parsecs) has been determined from the calibration of O-type star luminosities in Trumpler 16. After determining an abnormal reddening correction to the extinction, the distance to both Trumpler 14 and Trumpler 16 has been measured at 9,500±1000light-years (2,900±300parsecs).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Woolley {{redirected}} the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research {{towards the}} study of stars and galaxies. It took time to get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the Prime Minister for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric photometry, using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed Cepheid variable stars, which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the Small Magellanic Cloud and, later, the Large Magellanic Cloud. They also examined the colours of <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> in the Small Cloud.|$|E
5|$|Under certain {{circumstances}} the disk, which {{can now be}} called protoplanetary, may {{give birth to a}} planetary system. Protoplanetary disks have been observed around a very high fraction of stars in young <b>star</b> <b>clusters.</b> They exist from the beginning of a star's formation, but at the earliest stages are unobservable due to the opacity of the surrounding envelope. The disk of a Class0 protostar is thought to be massive and hot. It is an accretion disk, which feeds the central protostar. The temperature can easily exceed 400K inside 5AU and 1,000K inside 1AU. The heating of the disk is primarily caused by the viscous dissipation of turbulence in it and by the infall of the gas from the nebula. The high temperature in the inner disk causes most of the volatile material—water, organics, and some rocks to evaporate, leaving only the most refractory elements like iron. The ice can survive only in the outer part of the disk.|$|E

5|$|The {{constellation}} {{does not}} lie on the galactic plane of the Milky Way, {{and there are no}} prominent <b>star</b> <b>clusters.</b> NGC 625 is a dwarf irregular galaxy of apparent magnitude 11.0 and lying some 12.7 million light years distant. Only 24000 light years in diameter, it is an outlying member of the Sculptor Group. NGC 625 is thought to have been involved in a collision and is experiencing a burst of active star formation. NGC 37 is a lenticular galaxy of apparent magnitude 14.66. It is approximately 42 kiloparsecs (137,000 light-years) in diameter and about 12.9 billion years old. Robert's Quartet (composed of the irregular galaxy NGC 87, and three spiral galaxies NGC 88, NGC 89 and NGC 92) is a group of four galaxies located around 160 million light-years away which {{are in the process of}} colliding and merging. They are within a circle of radius of 1.6 arcmin, corresponding to about 75,000 light-years. Located in the galaxy ESO 243-49 is HLX-1, an intermediate-mass black hole—the first one of its kind identified. It is thought to be a remnant of a dwarf galaxy that was absorbed in a collision with ESO 243-49. Before its discovery, this class of black hole was only hypothesized.|$|E
