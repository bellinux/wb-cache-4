5|$|Within <b>South</b> <b>Africa,</b> {{there was}} growing {{realisation}} among opponents of apartheid that sport {{could play a}} role in pressuring the government. During the 1950s, <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> competed freely in international competition; the governing bodies of the major international sports recognised only the official, all-white South African institutions. By the end of the decade, this began to change. Several non-white sporting organisations within <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> united and began to influence international opinion. The resulting pressure brought about the suspension of the all-white Football Association of <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> from FIFA—for two years from 1961, then after a brief reinstatement, again from 1964—which prevented <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> from participating in the 1966 World Cup. <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> was also excluded from international fencing in 1964. However, because neither fencing nor football was closely followed in white <b>South</b> <b>Africa,</b> the impact was limited. Suspension from the Olympics had a greater effect; another campaign from within <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> and the consequent change in international opinion resulted in <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> being barred from the 1964 Olympics and those that followed.|$|E

5|$|Before 1928 {{the only}} flag that had {{official}} {{status in the}} Union of <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> was the United Kingdom's Union Jack as <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> {{was part of the}} British Empire. The <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> Red Ensign was used as an unofficial flag. In 1925, discussion rose about creating a new flag for <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> as many descendants of Boers found the Union Jack unacceptable after the Boer War. In 1926 the Balfour Declaration granted <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> legislative autonomy, opening the possibility of a new flag. British settlers wanted the Union Jack in the new flag as part of the British Empire while the Afrikaners did not. A compromise was reached whereby the new flag would consist of the Prince's Flag as this was the first flag raised on <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> and a badge of the Union Jack in the centre with the flags of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. The Union Jack was mirrored in the new flag with the hoist on the right so that it did not take precedence over the others.|$|E

5|$|Controversy {{continued}} to flare in Britain {{and other countries}} regarding sporting links with <b>South</b> <b>Africa.</b> The <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> rugby team's 1969–70 tour of Britain and Ireland was accompanied by mass demonstrations against apartheid, including an attempt by a protester in London to hijack the South African team bus, and a demonstration in Dublin where people {{tried to stop the}} South Africans from reaching the match venue by lying {{down in the middle of}} the street. The <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> cricket team was due to tour England shortly afterwards, and the MCC remained keen for the series to go ahead. They cancelled the tour a week before the South Africans were due to arrive, following public protests and pressure from the UK government. Virulent anti-apartheid demonstrations in Australia during the <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> rugby team's 1971 tour led to soaring police costs, matches played behind fences and barbed wire, and a state of emergency in Queensland, all of which prompted the Australian Cricket Board to cancel the tour by the <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> cricket team that had been scheduled to follow.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the First World War, Rhodesia's white {{population}} was split between the Unionists, for amalgamation into the Union of <b>South</b> <b>Africa,</b> and the Responsible Government Association, for independence. While the RGA was led by Coghlan, the Union Party's leader was Herbert Longden, another lawyer from Bulawayo. Longden, like the British Government, believed Rhodesia lacked the population and resources for an independent state. For Britain, union with <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> would mean avoiding having to buy out the BSAC, leaving the burden on <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> instead. After the war, Coghlan noted that the new Secretary of State, Winston Churchill, was determined to achieve the amalgamation of Southern Rhodesia with <b>South</b> <b>Africa.</b> For its part, the BSAC encouraged the Unionists, expecting that it would get a better price for its assets from <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> than from Southern Rhodesia. Other major corporations were also pro union, since <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> would be able to provide cheap labour from the south. These interests controlled the local press and were thus highly influential in the debate. With General Smuts, a skillful statesman, also {{on the side of the}} Unionists, it seemed unlikely that Coghlan would dissuade the electorate from entering into the Union.|$|E

40|$|A Zambezia essay {{review on}} <b>South</b> <b>Africa's</b> foreign policy during {{minority}} {{rule in the}} 1970 's. <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> relations {{with the rest of}} the world have been a subject of more intense debate at the United Nations and the O.

Recent works on the subject* agree that <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> foreign policy is the direct product of the Republic’s internal race policies. The least satisfactory of these is Cockram’s examination of Vorster’s foreign policy. Unlike Barber and Vandenbosch, who analyse <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> foreign policy in the context of the world at large, Cockram does attempt to give a comprehensive outline of <b>South</b> <b>Africa’s</b> concern with its immediate neighbours in Southern Africa and other black African states in the continent at large...|$|R

5|$|Having {{finished}} his school career, Crawford joined the first MCC tour of <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> in the 1905–06 season.

The MCC was criticised by the press in both England and <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> for omitting many of the strongest players. As {{the youngest member of}} the team, Crawford was given the traditional role of writing press reports to be sent back home during the tour. When the team played in Worcester during the tour, the local press carried a report that Crawford planned to remain in <b>South</b> <b>Africa.</b> The 1906 Wisden carried the same story; in a comment on his success in 1905, it suggested that it was uncertain for how long he would play, and questioned whether, if he played Test cricket, he would do so for England or <b>South</b> <b>Africa.</b> The cricket historian Nigel Hart queries why Wisden mentioned South Africa; Crawford's only known connection came through his uncle, who had left <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> five years before.|$|E
