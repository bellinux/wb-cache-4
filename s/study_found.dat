5|$|Although the Australian/New Zealand <b>study</b> <b>found</b> {{that the}} F94L {{mutation}} was partially to significantly recessive in most traits, meaning cattle heterozygous for the mutation express less to {{significantly less than}} half of the effects noted for homozygous cattle, the Japanese <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that the meat and fat quantities in cattle heterozygous for the mutation were about midway between the two extremes.|$|E

50|$|Evidence for {{an effect}} in adults over 65 years old is unclear. Systematic reviews {{examining}} both randomized controlled and case control <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> {{a lack of}} high-quality evidence.

5|$|In many {{temperate}} regions, beavers play {{an essential}} hydrological role. When building their dams and lodges, beavers alter {{the paths of}} streams and rivers and allow {{for the creation of}} extensive wetland habitats. One <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that engineering by beavers leads to a 33 percent {{increase in the number of}} herbaceous plant species in riparian areas. Another <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that beavers increase wild salmon populations.|$|E
5|$|A 1997 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> lower protein {{polymorphism}} in Antilope {{in comparison}} with Antidorcas, Eudorcas and Gazella. This was attributed to a history of rapid evolution of an autapomorphic phenotype of Antilope. This might have been aided by a particularly strong selection of a few dominant males due to its lekking behaviour.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that {{sperm whales}} sleep in {{vertical}} postures {{just under the}} surface in passive shallow 'drift-dives', generally during the day, during which whales {{do not respond to}} passing vessels unless they are in contact, leading to the suggestion that whales possibly sleep during such dives.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{meta-analysis}} of case-control and cohort <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> limited evidence for {{an association between}} higher garlic consumption and reduced risk of prostate cancer, but the studies were suspected as having publication bias. A 2013 {{meta-analysis of}} epidemiological <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> garlic intake {{to be associated with}} decreased risk of prostate cancer.|$|R

5|$|A 2009 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that {{individuals}} {{with a history of}} concussions might demonstrate a decline in both physical and mental performance for longer than 30 years. Compared to their peers with no history of brain trauma, sufferers of concussion exhibited effects including loss of episodic memory and reduced muscle speed.|$|E
5|$|A 2013 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that p-Coumaric acid, {{which is}} {{normally}} present in honey, assists bees in detoxifying certain pesticides. Its absence in artificial nutrients fed to bees may therefore contribute to CCD.|$|E

5|$|A {{follow-up}} <b>study</b> <b>found</b> {{that the}} optimum duration for the deep safety stop under the experimental conditions was 2.5 minutes, with a shallow safety stop of 3 to 5 minutes. Longer safety stops at either depth did not further reduce PDDB.|$|E
25|$|While some substitutive pharmacotherapies {{may have}} promise, current {{evidence}} is insufficient to support their use. Some <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> that the abrupt substitution of substitutive pharmacotherapy was actually less effective than gradual dose reduction alone, and only three <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> benefits of adding either melatonin, paroxetine, or trazodone and valproate {{in conjunction with a}} gradual dose reduction.|$|R
25|$|A {{review of}} {{longitudinal}} <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> that measures of baseline subjective well-being constructs such as optimism and positive affect predicted longer-term health status and mortality. Conversely, {{a number of}} <b>studies</b> <b>found</b> that baseline depression predicted poorer longer-term health status and mortality. Baseline health may well have a causal influence on subjective well-being so causality is difficult to establish.|$|R

5|$|A natural form {{of large}} scale {{environmental}} shading/dimming {{has been identified}} that affected the 2006 northern hemisphere hurricane season.

5|$|As indicated, hospice is {{frequently}} under-utilized and often not {{taken advantage of}} until very late in a patient's illness.

5|$|During oral {{argument}} before the Court, Scalia asked more questions and made more comments {{than any other}} justice—and a 2005 <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that he provoked laughter more often {{than any of his}} colleagues did.
