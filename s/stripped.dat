40|$|Abstract. <b>Strip</b> {{casting process}} is {{possible}} to shorten for producing <b>strip.</b> <b>Strip</b> is produced from molten metal continuously and directly by <b>strip</b> casting process. Melt drag process {{is one of the}} single roll <b>strip</b> casting process. Melt drag process is simpler than general twin roll <b>strip</b> casting process. One of defect of cast <b>strip</b> is surface conditions, for example surface roughness. Cast <b>strip</b> surface roughness is larger than hot rolled <b>strip.</b> Large <b>strip</b> surface roughness is negative effect for cold rolling after <b>strip</b> casting or hot rolling. The aim of this study is improvement of cast <b>strip</b> surface roughness by melt drag process. We suggested vertical melt drag process. And investigations were operated such us producing conditions of Al-Si alloy <b>strip,</b> surface roughness of cast <b>strip</b> and microstructures...|$|R

5|$|Elsewhere, <b>Stripped</b> also {{garnered}} commercial success. In the United Kingdom, {{the album}} debuted at number 19, and peaked at number two there.

50|$|The {{merchandising}} <b>strip</b> {{known as}} the Clip <b>Strip</b> brand <b>strip</b> was invented in 1979 by Edward Spitaletta, who started the Clip <b>Strip</b> Corporation.

50|$|Similarly, {{reversal}} of strips’ vertices {{will result in}} the same set of triangles if the <b>strip</b> has an even number of vertices. (e.g. <b>strip</b> FEDCBA will represent the same triangles FED,ECD,DCB,CAB as the original <b>strip).</b> However, if a <b>strip</b> has odd an number of vertices then the reversed <b>strip</b> will represent triangles with opposite orientation. For example, {{reversal of}} a <b>strip</b> ABCDE will result in <b>strip</b> EDCBA which represents triangles EDC, DBC, CBA).|$|R
50|$|Full-page <b>strips</b> were {{eventually}} replaced by <b>strips</b> half that size. <b>Strips</b> such as The Phantom and Terry and the Pirates began appearing in a format of two <b>strips</b> to a page in full-size newspapers, {{such as the}} New Orleans Times Picayune, or with one <b>strip</b> on a tabloid page, as in the Chicago Sun-Times. When Sunday <b>strips</b> {{began to appear in}} more than one format, it became necessary for the cartoonist to allow for rearranged, cropped or dropped panels. During World War II, because of paper shortages, the size of Sunday <b>strips</b> began to shrink. After the war, <b>strips</b> continued to get smaller and smaller because of increased paper and printing costs. The last full-page comic <b>strip</b> was the Prince Valiant <b>strip</b> for 11 April 1971.|$|R

50|$|Colour <b>strips</b> {{as used in}} The Mail On Sunday {{were added}} from book 36 during 1984.

50|$|Newspaper comic <b>strips</b> {{come in two}} {{different}} types: daily <b>strips</b> and Sunday <b>strips.</b> Most newspaper comic <b>strips</b> are syndicated; a syndicate hires people to write and draw a <b>strip</b> and then distributes it to many newspapers for a fee. A few newspaper <b>strips</b> are exclusive to one newspaper. For example, the Pogo comic <b>strip</b> by Walt Kelly originally appeared only in the New York Star in 1948 and was not picked up for syndication until the following year.|$|R
50|$|Other {{analogous}} <b>strips</b> can {{be obtained}} by similarly joining <b>strips</b> with two or more half-twists in them instead of one. For example, a <b>strip</b> with three half-twists, when divided lengthwise, becomes a twisted <b>strip</b> tied in a trefoil knot. (If this knot is unravelled, the <b>strip</b> has eight half-twists.) A <b>strip</b> with N half-twists, when bisected, becomes a <b>strip</b> with N + 1 full twists. Giving it extra twists and reconnecting the ends produces figures called paradromic rings.|$|R
