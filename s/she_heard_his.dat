5|$|Scully awakens the {{following}} day, so Mulder {{is called to}} the hospital and sees her, where she indicates <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> voice while in her coma and is given her cross necklace. Scully tells him she doesn't remember anything after being kidnapped by Duane Barry. Later Scully asks one of the nurses if she can see Nurse Owens, as she wants to thank her, but the nurse tells Scully that no nurse named Owens works at the hospital.|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{was born}} to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce {{aircraft}} engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), a science technician, on 31 July 1965 in Yate, [...] Gloucestershire, England, [...] northeast of Bristol. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Dugald Campbell, was Scottish, born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was French, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War. Rowling originally believed he had won the Légion d'honneur during the war, as {{she said when she}} received it herself in 2009. She later discovered the truth when featured in an episode of the UK genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, in which she found out it was a different Louis Volant who won the Legion of Honour. When <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> story of bravery and discovered the croix de guerre was for [...] "ordinary" [...] soldiers like her grandfather, who had been a waiter, she stated the croix de guerre was [...] "better" [...] to her than the Legion of Honour.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011, Susan Hill {{from the}} Daily Star {{reported}} that Lynsey {{would become the}} next target of serial killer Silas Blissett. Hassan revealed that executive producer Paul Marquess brought her into his office {{to tell her that}} she would be involved in a [...] "really big storyline", which he outlined to her, leaving her really excited. The storyline began when Lynsey angered Silas, who then attacked her. Silas was scared off after Lynsey's screams alerted his grandson Riley Costello (Rob Norbury) to the situation. Hassan thought Lynsey's [...] "steeliness" [...] helped her break free from Silas. Lynsey realised Silas was the one who attacked her, after <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> voice which [...] "triggers a flashback" [...] to the moment of the attack. Hassan added that when nobody believed Lynsey, it [...] "makes her want to bring Silas down even more. She's determined to find the evidence she needs to expose him for what he is". Waugh, who plays Lynsey's best friend Cheryl, explained that everyone believes that Lynsey is crazy and has made up the allegations. Lynsey then turns to Cheryl for help and although she hates seeing her best friend in such a state, Cheryl believed Lynsey was just being paranoid.|$|E
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> only <b>his</b> {{footsteps}} {{upon the}} stairs, swift and stealthy. In the hall {{he turned and}} looked up at her. She was leaning over the banisters.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not if {{you don't}} wish it,' she replied; and <b>she</b> {{distinctly}} <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> sigh of relief. 'Peter,' she asked, {{trying to speak}} firmly, 'what are your exact feelings for me?' ...|$|R
60|$|Oh! if {{his mother}} {{could have seen}} her son, For she loved him, her darling son; If <b>she</b> could <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> dying prayer, It would ease her heart till she met him there.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> words, she saw {{the look}} and {{knew that she had}} failed.|$|E
60|$|As {{they went}} by, Lord Rotherby bared {{his head and}} bowed, as did his companion. Her ladyship smiled upon him, but Hortensia's eyes looked rigidly ahead, her face a stone. <b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> grace's insolent laugh as they passed on; <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> voice--nowise subdued, for {{he was a man}} who loved to let the world hear what he might have to say.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> breath come fast {{between his}} teeth, and she {{realized}} his state of excitement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if {{you don't}} wish it," [...] she replied; and <b>she</b> {{distinctly}} <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> sigh of relief. [...] "Peter," [...] she asked, {{trying to speak}} firmly, [...] "what are your exact feelings to [about] me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{perhaps only}} I who haven't. It was on Aunt Maud's trying again {{three days ago}} to see him that <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> at <b>his</b> house of his having gone. He had started I believe some days before." ...|$|R
60|$|Miriam was startled. <b>She</b> <b>heard</b> him putting <b>his</b> bicycle in {{the stable}} underneath, and talking to Jimmy, {{who had been a}} pit-horse, and who was seedy.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. <b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> quick breath {{through the}} darkness. His voice assumed its harsher tone.|$|E
60|$|At that he wavered, and <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> teeth sliding {{against each}} other, {{as if he}} could no longer clench them.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} pretty girl?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> friend ask, as she hurried away a little frightened towards the Queen's Road gate.|$|E
60|$|Fortunately for her, her {{guardian}} avoided {{rather than}} sought her company. She {{met him at}} meals and scarcely more often than that, and though <b>she</b> often <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> voice about the house, usually raised in anger or impatience, he was invariably silent and taciturn when she was present.|$|R
60|$|Grant {{brought him}} in and struck a light, then hurriedly left the room; and Flora came with him, fully dressed, when he reappeared. Edgar {{supposed}} <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> sharp inquiry at the door, and he noticed that her expression was strained. He threw the note on the table.|$|R
6000|$|When <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>his</b> mournful death Margery {{sat in her}} nursing- chair, gravely {{thinking}} for nearly ten minutes, to the total neglect of her infant in the cradle. Jim, {{from the other side}} of the fire- place, said: 'You are sorry enough for him, Margery. I am sure of that.' ...|$|R
60|$|As {{in a dream}} <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>His</b> Royal Highness ask for {{the name}} of the young actress who was soliciting alms for the poor of Paris.|$|E
60|$|At {{one moment}} she felt sure that Kennard {{had called to}} her by name. <b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> voice distinctly, raised {{as if in a}} despairing cry.|$|E
6000|$|... "I... I {{would not}} have you keep it," [...] she murmured. <b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> sharply indrawn breath, felt him leaning over her, and was filled with an unaccountable fear.|$|E
60|$|Lizzie was a {{peculiar}} girl. She had, indeed, permitted Kenneth {{to visit her}} as a lover; but she resolutely refused to accept him {{as long as his}} father continued adverse to the union. The moment, however, that <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>his</b> being cast off and disinherited, she agreed, with tears in her eyes, to marry him whenever he pleased.|$|R
60|$|The {{elevator}} {{had stopped}} running, so Josie {{climbed the stairs}} and went thoughtfully to her room. Kauffman had preceded her. <b>She</b> <b>heard</b> him drop <b>his</b> shoes heavily upon the floor as he undressed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle, I want to {{have some}} serious {{conversation}} with you, if you have time," [...] she said, coming out of a brown study, as if <b>she</b> had not <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> question.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} say you're--a chambermaid?" [...] That {{was the first}} {{question}} which Chaffanbrass asked, and Bridget Bolster gave a little start as <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> sharp, angry, disagreeable voice.|$|E
6000|$|She charmed {{him with}} the white witchcraft, [...] She charmed {{him with the}} black, But he turned his fair young face to the wall, [...] Till <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> heart-strings crack.|$|E
60|$|At this, Petru {{told her}} that he had another task to fulfil at the well of the Fairy of the Dawn, and Venus was still better pleased when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> tale.|$|E
50|$|Lennier {{did not act}} on his {{feelings}} due to her involvement with John Sheridan. Lennier did confess {{his feelings}} to her when he and Delenn were both trapped in hyperspace facing death, but Delenn, who had long known of his feelings for her, feigned that <b>she</b> hadn't <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> confession in order to spare him embarrassment.|$|R
6000|$|If Miss Heale {{could have}} watched Tom's {{face as he}} read, much more could <b>she</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> words as he finished, all jealousy would have passed from her mind: for as he read, the cynical smile grew sharper and sharper, forming a fit prelude for the [...] "Little fool!" [...] which was his only comment.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{told them}} {{the whole story of}} the attack, of his being carried away, and of his {{unexpected}} release; of the search that had been made for him and the arrest of eighteen of his assailants. Millicent grew pale as he continued, and burst into tears when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>his</b> being a prisoner {{in the hands of the}} Hindoos.|$|R
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} he held {{her in his arms}} at the gate, and <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> firm tread die in the dust of the road. The South had claimed him at last.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> words {{beneath his}} voice Somehow, and they {{produced}} pictures that dazzled her. Luminous shadows moved before her eyes, drifting across the gray background of her poor, starved, work-weary life.|$|E
60|$|Niaz {{was gone}} for three days, as often happened, and on the fourth night, after she had retired to her lonely bedroom, she felt sure <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> voice {{speaking}} low somewhere in the courtyard.|$|E
60|$|She leant yet lower towards Marcus and listened. He was not dead, for he breathed. More, <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> him stir <b>his</b> {{hand and}} thought {{that she could see}} it move upwards towards his wounded head. Then she drew back.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{scarcely}} <b>heard</b> <b>his</b> words. The room seemed wheeling {{round with}} her, the floor unsteady beneath her feet. The {{atmosphere of the}} place had suddenly become horrible,--the faint odor of burning leaves, the pictures, almost like caricatures, which mocked her from the walls, the grinning idols, the strangely shaped weapons in their cases of black oak. She faltered as she crossed the room, but recovered herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Git the hosses in, if {{you want}} to," [...] Creech called to her, and then as Lucy started off to where the mustangs grazed <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> him curse <b>his</b> son. [...] "Come back hyar! Leave the girl alone or I'll rap you one!" ...|$|R
