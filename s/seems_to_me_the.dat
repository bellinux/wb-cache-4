25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

2500|$|Historical {{accounts}} {{indicate the}} decision to use the atomic bombs was made in order to provoke a surrender of Japan by use of an awe-inspiring power. These observations have caused Michael Walzer to state the incident was an act of [...] "war terrorism: the effort to kill civilians in such large numbers that their government is forced to surrender. Hiroshima <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> classic case." ...|$|E

2500|$|Germany – In an {{interview}} with Der Spiegel, Marcel Kuhlmey, {{professor in the department}} of security management at the Berlin University of Economics and Law, a security expert, who asserted that what happened in Ferguson could never happen in Germany, stating that [...] "In the U.S., it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>the</b> police are far quicker to resort to guns.

2500|$|The poet/critic Randall Jarrell often praised Frost's {{poetry and}} wrote, [...] "Robert Frost, along with Stevens and Eliot, <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{greatest}} of the American poets of this century. Frost's virtues are extraordinary. No other living poet has written so well about {{the actions of}} ordinary men; his wonderful dramatic monologues or dramatic scenes {{come out of a}} knowledge of people that few poets have had, and they are written in a verse that uses, sometimes with absolute mastery, the rhythms of actual speech." [...] He also praised [...] "Frost's seriousness and honesty," [...] stating that Frost was particularly skilled at representing a wide range of human experience in his poems.|$|E
2500|$|Ecclesiastes {{has had a}} deep {{influence}} on Western literature. It contains several phrases that have resonated in British and American culture, and was quoted by Abraham Lincoln addressing Congress in 1862. American novelist Thomas Wolfe wrote: [...] "f all I have ever seen or learned, that book <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of man's life upon this earth—and also the highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth. I am not given to dogmatic judgments {{in the matter of}} literary creation, but if I had to make one I could say that Ecclesiastes is the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound." ...|$|E

2500|$|... s {{regards the}} Catholic Faith, [...] is a sterile land and very {{laborious}} to cultivate, where the Catholic Faith has very shallow roots, and with much labor little fruit is produced, and from little cause {{that which is}} planted and cultivated withers. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Faith can endure little time in these parts...And now, {{in the time of}} this plague, having tested the faith of those who come to confess, very few respond properly prior to the confession; thus we can be certain that, though preached to more than fifty years, if they were now left alone, if the Spanish nation were not to intercede, I am certain that in less than fifty years there would be no trace of the preaching which has been done for them.|$|E
2500|$|The December 1997 {{issue of}} The Comics Journal {{featured}} an extensive collection of testimonials to Peanuts. Over forty cartoonists, from mainstream newspaper cartoonists to underground, independent comic artists, shared {{reflections on the}} power and influence of Schulz' art. Gilbert Hernandez wrote [...] "Peanuts {{was and still is}} for me a revelation. It's mostly from Peanuts where I was inspired to create the village of Palomar in Love and Rockets. Schulz' characters, the humor, the insight... gush, gush, gush, bow, bow, bow, grovel, grovel, grovel..." [...] Tom Batiuk wrote: [...] "The influence of Charles Schulz on the craft of cartooning is so pervasive it is almost taken for granted." [...] Batiuk also described the depth of emotion in Peanuts: [...] "Just beneath the cheerful surface were vulnerabilities and anxieties that we all experienced, but were reluctant to acknowledge. By sharing those feelings with us, Schulz showed us a vital aspect of our common humanity, which is, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>the</b> ultimate goal of great art." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bakunin {{thought that}} [...] "Does it follow that I reject all {{authority}}? Far from {{me such a}} thought. In the matter of boots, I refer {{to the authority of}} the bootmaker; concerning houses, canals, or railroads, I consult that of the architect or the engineer. For such or such special knowledge I apply to such or such a savant. But I allow neither the bootmaker nor the architect nor savant to impose his authority upon me. I listen to them freely and with all the respect merited by their intelligence, their character, their knowledge, reserving always my incontestable right of criticism and censure. I do not content myself with consulting a single authority in any special branch; I consult several; I compare their opinions, and choose that which <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> soundest. But I recognise no infallible authority, even in special questions; consequently, whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such individual, I have no absolute faith in any person." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Carthaginians {{suffered}} heavy {{casualties and}} their field forces were virtually eliminated for some time. Some ancient authorities refrain from giving specific numbers, but others give figures between 30,000 and 40,000 {{for the men}} who were killed, and up to 5,000 for those taken alive. Almost all sources (except Cassius Dio) agree that the losses of the Romans were minimal. Polybius wrote: [...] "...it is not possible to find any other disaster which even if exaggerated could be compared with this, so much did it exceed in horror all previous events. Therefore of all the brilliant exploits performed by Scipio this <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> most splendid and most adventurous." [...] With one single strike Scipio was able {{to get rid of the}} Carthaginian blockade and to renew the offensive operations of the previous summer. What followed shortly afterwards was the battle of the Great Plains, which ended with another crushing defeat of Hasdrubal Gisgo and Syphax. Carthage had to recall its armies from Italy for a last decisive encounter that took place in 202 BC, and resulted in a final defeat and a peace treaty, ending the Second Punic War in 201 BC.|$|E
2500|$|Ecclesiastes {{has had a}} deep {{influence}} on Western literature. It contains several phrases that have resonated in British and American culture, such as [...] "eat, drink and be merry," [...] "nothing new under the sun," [...] "a time to be born and a time to die," [...] and [...] "vanity of vanities; all is vanity." [...] Abraham Lincoln quoted Ecclesiastes 1:4 in his address to the reconvening Congress on December 1, 1862, during the darkest hours of the American Civil War: [...] "'One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.'...Our strife pertains to ourselves—to the passing generations of men; and it can without convulsion be hushed forever {{with the passing of}} one generation." [...] American novelist Thomas Wolfe wrote: [...] "f all I have ever seen or learned, that book <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of man's life upon this earth—and also the highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth.
