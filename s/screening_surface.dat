50|$|High {{frequency}} {{vibrating screens}} {{are the most}} important screening machines primarily utilised in the mineral processing industry. They are used to separate feeds containing solid and crushed ores down to approximately 200μm in size, and are applicable to both perfectly wetted and dried feed. The frequency of the screen is mainly controlled by an electromagnetic vibrator which is mounted above and directly connected to the <b>screening</b> <b>surface.</b> Its high frequency characteristics differentiates it from a normal vibrating screen. The high frequency vibrating screens usually operates at an inclined angle, traditionally varying between 0 and 25 degrees and can go up to a maximum of 45 degrees. Besides, it should operate at a low stroke and has a frequency ranging from 1500 - 7200 RPM.|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} offered which yields the solar {{irradiation}} {{at the ground}} of a single-span greenhouse fitted with screens, {{in terms of the}} outside solar irradiation, the position of the sun, the optical properties of the cladding and screening surfaces, the geometry of the <b>screening</b> <b>surface</b> and orientation of the axis of the greenhouse. The model is mathematically exact. From the physical point of view it is founded on the assumption that both the cladding and the screening surfaces are fully diffusive and the radiation diffused through the atmosphere and by the ground is fully isotropic. The importance of the geometry and of the optical properties of the screen in blocking the admission of solar irradiation inside are indicated. It is found that the solar irradiation inside a greenhouse, with any given cladding material, with any orientation and fitted with shading screens, is mainly determined by the transmittance of the <b>screening</b> <b>surface</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} by its reflectance. The collected radiation increases with the transmittance of the <b>screening</b> <b>surface</b> and for a given transmittance, with the reflectance of both the bottom side and topside of the screen.

But the influence of these interactions on the screening process effects on both the efficiency {{and the value of}} the product (Soldinger 2000; Zhao et al. 2000; Jiao et al. 2006). We divide the screening process into four parts as follows: (1) looseness: the void space that occurs between particles which are rebounded by the sieve plate. A sufficient void space contributes to particle stratification (Zhang and Tong 2012). (2) Stratification: the ability of the fine particles to penetrate the coarse granules, when all particles are scattered. In other words, stratification relates to the ability of the fine particles to approach the <b>screening</b> <b>surface</b> (Xiao and Tong 2012). (3) Collision: once close to the <b>screening</b> <b>surface,</b> some particles impact the sieve wires and some pass through the sieve mesh. These particles that are near the mesh are referred to as the collision particles (Wei et al. 1999). (4) Penetration: the penetration rate is the fraction of the collision particles which penetrate the mesh. It has a direct effect on screening performance.|$|E

40|$|The neurotoxin ß-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is {{suspected}} {{to play a}} role in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Because BMAA seems to be produced by cyanobacteria, surface waters are screened for BMAA. However, reliable analysis of BMAA requires specialized and expensive equipment. In 2012, a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for determination of BMAA in surface waters was released. This kit could enable fast and relatively cheap screening of surface waters for BMAA. The objective of this study was to determine whether the BMAA ELISA kit was suitable for the determination of BMAA concentrations in surface waters. We hypothesised that the recovery of spiked samples was close to 100 % and that the results of unspiked sample analysis were comparable between ELISA and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. However, we found that recovery was higher than 100 % in most spiked samples, highest determined recovery was over 400 %. Furthermore, the ELISA gave a positive signal for nearly each tested sample while no BMAA could be detected by LC-MS/MS. We therefore conclude that in its current state, the kit is not suitable for <b>screening</b> <b>surface</b> waters for BMAA...|$|E

40|$|Modulation of voltage-dependent {{sodium and}} {{potassium}} currents by charged amphiphiles {{was investigated in}} cardiac ventricular myocytes using the patch-clamp technique. Negatively charged sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) increased amplitude of INa, whereas positively charged dodecyltrimethylammonium (DDTMA) decreased INa. Furthermore, SDS shifted the steady-state activation and inactivation of INa in the negative direction, whereas DDTMA shifted the curves in the opposite direction. These shifts provided {{an explanation for the}} changes in current amplitude. Activation and inactivation kinetics of INa were accelerated by SDS but slowed by DDTMA. These changes in both steady- state gating and kinetics of INa are consistent with a decrease of the intramembrane field by SDS and an increase of the field by DDTMA due to an alteration of surface potential after their insertion into the outer monolayer of the sarcolemma. The effect of SDS on the steady-state inactivation of INa was concentration dependent and partially reversed by <b>screening</b> <b>surface</b> charges with increased extracellular [Ca 2 +]. These amphiphiles also altered the activation of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK,del), producing a shift in the negative direction by SDS but in the positive direction by DDTMA. These results suggest that the insertion of charged amphiphiles into the cell membrane alters the behavior of voltage-dependent INa and IK,del by changing the surface charge density, and consequently the surface potential and implies, although indirectly, that the lipid surface charges are important to the voltage-dependent gating of these channels...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The study aims to {{identify}} the causes of premature destruction of concrete sleepers of one of Ukrainian producers. Methodology. Applied microstructural, fractographic, X-ray microanalysis revealed causes of transient corrosion processes in concrete. Findings. Subject of study in this work is a cement rock and concrete structure of prematurely shattered concrete sleepers. Another premature destruction of concrete sleepers was studied using the traditional method for Dnipropetrovsk National University of Railway Transport named after Academician V. Lazaryan (DNURT) that was patented in 2009. The conducted research showed: 1) a cement rock near the sand particles of high concentration of chlorine and alkali metals exceeding permissible in existing standards; 2) different grained cement crystals indicates excess {{of water in the}} concrete mixture; 3) the presence in the cement rock structure of wood fibers, which are due to the additional moisture absorption accelerate chemical reactions in the operated concrete sleepers; 4) speed of alkaline-silicic-acidic reaction in concrete sleepers is 5 microns per year; 5) availability of wood fibers indicates unsatisfactory purity of aggregates screening, including crushed stone; 6) chlorine ions further accelerate structural transformation reaction of cement. Originality. The paper found the rate of corrosion processes in concrete sleepers of Ukrainian producer. The influence on the corrosion rate of contamination of large aggregates of organic substances, including wood fibers was shown in the article. There were presented characteristic signs of accelerating corrosion processes as a result of excess of water and chlorine ions in the structure of cement rock. Practical value. Identifying the typical signs of premature destruction of concrete under rail foundations prevents massive failure of railway sleepers, which affects negatively the railway traffic safety.
