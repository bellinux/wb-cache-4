5|$|Nixon's {{career was}} {{frequently}} dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it. Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms, {{to the point}} where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred. He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls, slumped shoulders, and a furrowed, <b>sweaty</b> brow.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} new {{sketches}} were also added, including <b>Sweaty</b> Betty's Burger Bar and QCV' (Quite Cheap Value), a parody of the shopping channel QVC which saw Cawood and Suttie as fictitious presenters Hilary and Ursula, two garishly dressed middle aged women with a strong dislike for each other who would try to promote a useless product whilst making snide digs at each other underneath forced smiles and insincere laughter.|$|E
5|$|Then they disinterred the {{chieftain}} {{and gave}} him new clothes. In his grave, he received intoxicating drinks, fruits, and a stringed instrument. The chieftain was put into his bed with all his weapons and grave offerings around him. Then they had two horses run themselves <b>sweaty,</b> cut them to pieces, and threw the meat into the ship. Finally, they sacrificed a hen and a cock.|$|E

Navin, Jr. portrays a teenage boy in the cold open, Erik Holland has a brief bit as Diane's first customer, and Ron Frazier appears as a barfly who stands at the bar near Cliff (and who offers [...] "Ben Hur" [...] as his choice for the <b>sweatiest</b> movie ever made.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Personal Best {{garnered}} a 77% {{approval rating}} at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. It was {{noted for its}} physicality and forthright treatment of sensitive emotional issues. Roger Ebert gave the film four of a possible four stars and wrote: [...] "This is a very physical movie, one of the healthiest and <b>sweatiest</b> celebrations of physical exertion I can remember...It {{is filled with the}} uncertainties, risks, cares, and rewards of real life, and it considers its characters' hearts and minds, and sees their sexuality as an expression of their true feelings for each other." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{reacts with}} moisture {{on the skin}} and in the eyes, causing a burning sensation and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of the eyes. Effects usually include tears streaming from the eyes, profuse coughing, exceptional nasal discharge that is full of mucus, burning in the eyes, eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where <b>sweaty</b> and/or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Almost all of the immediate effects wear off within an hour (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although the feeling of burning and highly irritated skin may persist for hours. Affected clothing {{will need to be}} washed several times or thrown away.|$|E
5|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions {{has not yet been}} determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. The unit is mostly a redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the touchpad that is farther up the neck of the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a more accurate and responsive touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses, a more accurate strum bar, and a controller finish that makes it easier to handle with <b>sweaty</b> hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those from Rock Band and selected other rhythm games.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such {{references in}} the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; her hair was greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids, the actresses' hair was not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins a <b>sweaty</b> character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair {{and gave him a}} low parting to suggest baldness.|$|E

5|$|To {{create the}} {{character}} animations for the game, actors {{were placed in}} front of a gray background and performed the motions, which were recorded on videotape (using a broadcast-quality, $20,000 Sony camera instead of the standard Hi8 camera used for the original Mortal Kombat). The video capture footage was then processed into a computer, and the background was removed from selected frames to create sprites. Towards the end of the game's development, they opted to instead use a blue screen technique and processed the footage directly into the computer for a similar, simpler process. The actors were lightly sprayed with water to give them a <b>sweaty,</b> glistening appearance, while post-editing was done on the sprites afterward to highlight flesh tones and improve the visibility of muscles, which Tobias felt set the series apart from similar games using digitized graphics. Animations of Shang Tsung morphing into other characters were created by Midway's John Vogel using a computer, while hand-drawn animations were used for other parts of the game, such as the Fatalities. For animating Goro and Kintaro, clay sculptures were created by Tobias' friend Curt Chiarelli and then turned into 12-inch latex miniatures that were used for stop motion filming. Because of technical restrictions, the actors' costumes had to be simple and no acrobatic moves such as backflips could have been recorded; the hardest moves to perform were some of the jumping kicks.|$|E
25|$|Various anecdotes in Livy's {{history of}} Rome reflect the toga's {{symbolic}} value. In one, the patrician hero Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, retired from public life and clad (presumably) in tunic or loincloth, is ploughing his field when emissaries of the Senate arrive, {{and ask him}} to put on his toga. His wife fetches it and he puts it on. Then he is told that he has been appointed dictator. He promptly heads for Rome. Donning the toga transforms Cincinnatus from rustic, <b>sweaty</b> ploughman – though a gentleman nevertheless, of impeccable stock and reputation – into Rome's leading politician, eager to serve his country; a top-quality Roman. Rome's abundant public and private statuary reinforced the notion that all Rome's great men wore togas, and must always have done so.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} gameplay {{is based}} on that of Dead or Alive 3, with several changes. Like in the other games in the series, fights in Dead or Alive 5 are based on an interruption triangle system in which strikes (normal attacks) beat throws, throws beat holds (strike interception attacks), and holds beat strikes, all of such counterattacks causing extra damage. Tag team battles from the previous DOA games have been retained. The fights take place in interactive and now more highly-destructive arenas. The game's characters are rendered in much more realistic visual style {{than in the previous}} titles in the series, including new details such as the fighters getting <b>sweaty</b> and their clothes getting dirty during the fights, costume-specific breast physics and semi-transparent clothing.|$|E
50|$|A similar implement, {{the foot}} press or foot screw, {{consisted}} {{of a pair of}} horizontal iron plates slowly tightened around the bare foot by means of a crank mechanism to crush the bones. Although it was quite standard to line the lower plate with ribs to prevent the foot from popping out of the grip of the instrument as it became <b>sweatier,</b> a crueler variant of this device - typically encountered in Nuremberg, Germany - lined the upper plate with hundreds of sharp spikes. A version from Venice, sometimes called the foot screw or toe breaker, connected the crank mechanism to a drill that slowly mutilated the foot by boring a hole {{through the center of the}} instep as the press was tightened. The instrument was of sufficient power and cruelty to pulverize the tiniest of toe bones.|$|R
5000|$|Helmets provide {{important}} head protection. The use of helmets, {{in one form}} or another, is almost universal amongst all mountain bikers. The main three types are cross-country, rounded skateboarder style (nicknamed [...] "half shells" [...] or [...] "skate style") and full-face. Cross-country helmets tend to be light and well ventilated, and more comfortable to wear for long periods, especially while perspiring in hot weather. In XC competitions, most bikers use the usual road-racing style helmets, for their lightweight and aerodynamic qualities. Skateboard helmets are simpler and cheaper than other helmet types; provide greater coverage of the head and resist minor scrapes and knocks. Unlike road-biking helmets, skateboard helmets typically have a thicker, hard plastic shell which can take multiple impact before it needs to be replaced. The trade-off for this is that they tend to be much heavier and less ventilated (<b>sweatier),</b> therefore not suitable for endurance-based riding. Full-face helmets (BMX-style) provide the highest level of protection, being stronger again than skateboard style and including a jaw guard to protect the face. The weight is the main issue with this type, but today they are often reasonably well-ventilated and made of lightweight materials such as carbon fiber. (Full-face helmets with detachable chin-guards are available in some locations, but there are compromises to keep in mind with these designs.) As all helmets should meet minimum standards, SNELL B.95 (American Standard) BS EN 1078:1997 (European Standard), DOT or [...] "motorized ratings" [...] are making their way into the market. The choice of helmet often comes down to rider preference, likelihood of crashing, and on what features or properties of a helmet they place emphasis. Helmets are mandatory at competitive events and almost without exception at bike parks, most organisations also stipulate when and where full-face helmets must be used.|$|R

He wrote a lyric book, It Is Written, Baby (1997). With Moore, he composed and performed the score of the movie Bad Eggs (2003), for Mahony's short film Ray (2005). Graney contributed music to and played a small (musical) part in Stone (2004), a stage production of the 1960s British play.|$|E
25|$|The immortal souls {{that follow}} the gods most closely {{are able to}} just barely raise their chariots up to the rim and look out on reality. They see some things and miss others, {{having to deal with}} their horses; they rise and fall at varying times. Other souls, while {{straining}} to keep up, are unable to rise, and in noisy, <b>sweaty</b> discord they leave uninitiated, not having seen reality. Where they go after is then dependent on their own opinions, rather than the truth. Any soul that catches sight of any true thing is granted another circuit where it can see more; eventually, all souls fall back to earth. Those that have been initiated are put into varying human incarnations, depending on how much they have seen; those made into philosophers have seen the most, while kings, statesmen, doctors, prophets, poets, manual laborers, sophists, and tyrants follow respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} frame backpack {{is a recent}} innovation, invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, {{who went on to}} found Lowe Alpine and Lowepro, companies specializing in backpacks and other forms of carrying bags for various equipment. An internal-frame pack has a large fabric section around an {{internal frame}} composed of strips of either aluminum, titanium or plastic, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. A complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The internal frame permits the pack to fit closely to the wearer's back and minimizes shifting of the load, which is desirable when participating in activities that involve upper-body movement such as scrambling over rocky surfaces and skiing. However, the tight fit reduces ventilation, so these type of packs tend to be more <b>sweaty</b> than external frame packs. The internal construction also allows for a large storage compartment; a few lash points (including webbing loops and straps for sleeping bags and other large items) may be present, but as the frame is completely integrated, it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the pack. Internal frame packs originally suffered from smaller load capacity and less comfortable fit during steady walking, but newer models have improved greatly in these respects. In addition, because of their snug fit, the improved internal frame models have largely replaced external frame backpacks for many activities.|$|E

Plus, <b>sweaty</b> dancers in underground tunnels pulsing and writhing in sync to the music? Seems like as good a way as any to survive the apocalypse." [...] Willa Paskin of New York commented that Spears [...] "tries hard {{not to make the}} same mistakes as the inadvertently depressing 'Hold It Against Me.' There's more dancing — though it's still largely arm-related — and much, much more smiling." [...] The music video was nominated at the 2011 MuchMusic Video Awards in the category of International Video of the Year — Artist, but lost to Lady Gaga's [...] "Judas". It also received two nominations at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards in the categories of Best Pop Video and Best Choreography.

500|$|Goldstein was {{struggling}} with his former addiction during the filming of Gone Too Far. He held a crack-pipe during one episode. BJ Hickman, an intervention expert who appeared in two episodes, noticed Goldstein [...] "had a moment" [...] holding the crack pipe, and later {{felt the need to}} call his sponsor. Goldstein later said of the experience: [...] "I realized my palms were <b>sweaty</b> and I was like, wait a minute, this is not smart for me to be holding this." [...] In another episode, a police officer shows Goldstein confiscated drugs, including a bag of crack cocaine. Shortly thereafter, Goldstein leaves the building, informing the camera crew that he felt so tempted to consume the drugs that it was not safe for him to remain there.|$|E
500|$|Spin {{magazine}} {{described the}} Pixies' musical style as [...] "Surf music-meets-Stooges spikiness and oft-imitated stop/start and quiet/loud dynamics". Their music {{has also been}} pictured as [...] "an unorthodox marriage of surf music and punk rock, ... characterized by Black's bristling lyrics and hackle-raising caterwaul, Kim Deal's whispered harmonies and waspy basslines, Joey Santiago's fragile guitar, and the persistent flush of David Lovering's drums." [...] The band's music incorporates extreme dynamic shifts; Francis explained in 1991, [...] "Those are the two basic components of rock music... the dreamy side and the rockin' side. It's always been either <b>sweaty</b> or laid back and cool. We do try to be dynamic, but it's dumbo dynamics, because we don't {{know how to do}} anything else.

What is This? had finally disbanded, and Irons {{returned to}} the Chili Peppers in mid 1986 after Martinez was fired. Flea, Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained. Flea recalled that [...] "it began to seem ugly to me and not fun; our communication was not healthy". Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving {{the rest of the}} group to work on much of the album's material by themselves. The band lived in Detroit for a portion of the recording of the album, where Kiedis and Slovak indulged in heavy cocaine use. [...] When Slovak was under the influence, he would often wear brightly colored clothing and dance in a [...] "shuffling" [...] fashion, which became the inspiration for the song [...] "Skinny <b>Sweaty</b> Man" [...] from the band's next album. [...] After Kiedis completed a stint in rehab, he rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. Slovak felt a deep connection to the album; he reflected in his diary [...] "It was so fun. I'm so extremely proud of everybody's workit is at times genius." [...] Slovak was the subject of the songs [...] "Skinny <b>Sweaty</b> Man", [...] "Me and My Friends", & [...] "No Chump Love Sucker". He was nicknamed [...] "Slim Bob Billy", [...] "Slim", or [...] "Huckleberry", and throughout the albums Kiedis calls him by these nicknames before he starts a guitar solo.

She {{was drawn to the}} relatable qualities of her character: [...] "She was not some <b>sweaty,</b> tank-top-wearing, Uzi-carrying super woman". Robert Koehler of Variety found her [...] "increasingly impressive" [...] while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times asserted that [...] "she brings more presence and credibility to her role than is really expected; she acts without betraying the slightest awareness that she's inside a genre.

500|$|Brideshead Revisited was {{published}} in London in May 1945. Waugh had been convinced of the book's qualities, [...] "my first novel rather than my last". It was a tremendous success, bringing its author fame, fortune and literary status. Happy though he was with this outcome, Waugh's principal concern as the war ended was {{the fate of the}} large populations of Eastern European Catholics, betrayed (as he saw it) into the hands of Stalin's Soviet Union by the Allies. He now saw little difference in morality between the war's combatants and later described it as [...] "a <b>sweaty</b> tug-of-war between teams of indistinguishable louts". Although he took momentary pleasure from the defeat of Winston Churchill and his Conservatives in the 1945 general election, he saw the accession to power of the Labour Party as a triumph of barbarism and the onset of a new [...] "Dark Age".|$|E
500|$|Writing for Slant Magazine, Kyle Fowle spoke favorably of {{the track}} and opined that it [...] "pulses and swirls like <b>sweaty</b> bodies on the dance floor." [...] However, in a more mixed review, Jason Lipshutz from Billboard {{acknowledged}} that its production [...] "zig-zags impressively", while also suggesting that its chorus failed to leave the impact that the refrain for [...] "Wrecking Ball" [...] did. Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised {{the production of the}} song, writing, [...] "Mike WiLL steps outside of his 'thunderous' signature all over Bangerz; on Someone Else and Drive, he approaches EDM on his own pop-rap terms, asking Cyrus' 'Jolene' twang and jackhammer buzz to serve his complex arrangements, rather than dropping some 808s on top of a dustep drop. 'Drive', which I favor, has no grandiose drop, just a stubborn pulse that gives the song its appealing undercurrent of ugly, tightly coiled strength." ...|$|E
500|$|For scenes {{showing the}} {{exterior}} of the Nostromo, a [...] landing leg was constructed to give a sense of the ship's size. Ridley Scott was not convinced that it looked large enough, so he had his two young sons and the son of Derek Vanlint (the film's cinematographer) stand in for the regular actors, wearing smaller space suits to make the set-pieces seem larger. The same technique was used for the scene in which the crew members encounter the dead alien creature in the derelict spacecraft. The children nearly collapsed due to the heat of the suits; oxygen systems were eventually added to help the actors breathe. Four identical cats were used to portray Jones, the crew's pet. During filming, Sigourney Weaver discovered that she was allergic to the combination of cat hair and the glycerin placed on the actors' skin to make them appear <b>sweaty.</b> By removing the glycerin she was able to continue working with the cats.|$|E
500|$|Hogarth {{took his}} {{inspiration}} for the series from the classical satires of Horace and Juvenal, via their Augustan counterparts, particularly John Gay's [...] "Trivia" [...] and Jonathan Swift's [...] "A Description of a City Shower" [...] and [...] "A Description of the Morning". He took his artistic models from other series of the [...] "Times of Day", [...] "The Seasons" [...] and [...] "Ages of Man", such as those by Nicolas Poussin and Nicholas Lancret, and from pastoral scenes, but executed them with a twist by transferring them to the city. He also drew on the Flemish [...] "Times of Day" [...] style known as points du jour, in which the gods floated above pastoral scenes of idealised shepherds and shepherdesses, but in Hogarth's works the gods were recast as his central characters: the churchgoing lady, a frosty Aurora in Morning; the pie-girl, a pretty London Venus in Noon; the pregnant woman, a <b>sweaty</b> Diana in Evening; and the freemason, a drunken Pluto in Night.|$|E
