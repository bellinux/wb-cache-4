Objectives {{for this study}} were to (1) characterize <b>shock</b> effects in a complex polymineralic rock with a significant proportion of hydrous ferromagnesian minerals, both as a function of variable <b>shock</b> pressure and preshock temperature, and (2) to explore the effects of <b>shock</b> impedance contrast between component minerals on the respective abundances and distribution of these features. At any <b>shock</b> pressure, the order of decreasing intensity of <b>shock</b> metamorphic effects in component phases is: cordierite (Crd) biotite (Bt) plagioclase (Pl) K-feldspar (Kfs) quartz (Qtz) garnet (Grt) orthopyroxene (Opx). Samples <b>shocked</b> to pressures below 40 GPa (25 °C) were typically characterized by marked heterogeneous distribution of <b>shock</b> effects on both intragranular and intergranular scales. <b>Shock</b> heterogeneity is mainly attributed to <b>shock</b> impedance contrast between contiguous phases, and manifests as <b>shock</b> amplification locally where <b>shock</b> impedance contrast is greatest, and <b>shock</b> suppression where impedance contrast is least. The heterogeneous distribution of <b>shock</b> metamorphic effects in both experiments and natural rocks is a signature of extreme disequilibrium at the submillimeter scale.

50|$|Normal <b>shock</b> {{waves are}} <b>shock</b> waves that are {{perpendicular}} to the local flow direction.

Because a loss of energy occurs over the thin <b>shock</b> wave, the <b>shock</b> is considered non-isentropic and enthalpy increases across the <b>shock.</b> When analysing a normal <b>shock</b> wave, one-dimensional, steady, and adiabatic (stagnation temperature does not change across the <b>shock</b> wave) flow of a perfect gas is assumed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{capability}} to withstand non-contact underwater explosions (UNDEX) {{is an important}} aspect to be emphasized {{in the design of}} modern warships, and <b>shock</b> testing is one of the efficient methods to qualify the ability. A brief history on the research of <b>shock</b> testing of naval shipboard equipment as well as major means in evaluating anti-shock performance of warship equipment is introduced first in this paper. Three prevailing <b>shock</b> test methods: UNDEX testing, virtual <b>shock</b> trial and land-based test with <b>shock</b> test machines are presented with the focus on the advances in <b>shock</b> test machines in US and Europe. Comparison of current <b>shock</b> testing facilities is also given. Moreover, some new concepts of <b>shock</b> test machines are reviewed as well, and three major directions of the development of <b>shock</b> test machines are concluded. The first trend is that <b>shock</b> testing machines are required to generate positive and negative <b>shock</b> pulse to simulate real UNDEX environment made up of <b>shock</b> wave followed by bubble pulse and structural whipping. The second is that <b>shock</b> test machines can test heavy equipments, and the last is that <b>shock</b> pulses can be controlled and customized conveniently. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{boundary}} layer which is {{formed as a}} <b>shock</b> wave propagates down a <b>shock</b> tube causes both <b>shock</b> attenuation and <b>shock</b> curvature. Hartunian studied the curvature effect; however, as he points out, because of the singularities at {{the leading edge of the}} {{boundary layer}} his solution is not valid where the <b>shock</b> wave touches the tube wall. A detailed study is now made of the flow near the leading edge of this shock‐induced boundary layer for a weak <b>shock</b> wave. The leading‐edge flow can be divided into a shear layer near the wall, and into a free stream or <b>shock</b> region. By expanding the Navier—Stokes equations in the small parameter M 1 * — 1 and stretching the coordinates, simplified equations for the shear layer and <b>shock</b> region are obtained. The shear layer and <b>shock</b> region flows interact and it is found that the <b>shock</b> region must be a zone of non‐Hugoniot flow where the <b>shock</b> structure is two dimensional. An approximate solution of the <b>shock</b> shape is obtained by replacing the <b>shock</b> region by an oblique <b>shock</b> which is approximately matched to the shear layer...|$|R
