40|$|AbstractObjectives: Poststernotomy {{mediastinitis}} after cardiac {{operations is}} a nosocomial infection involving the mediastinal {{space and the}} sternum, with a high mortality rate mostly related to a late diagnosis. We investigated whether <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture</b> might facilitate and shorten the delay in the diagnosis of mediastinitis. Methods: Of 1024 patients undergoing sternotomy for cardiac surgery, <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture</b> was performed in a subgroup of 49 patients in whom mediastinitis was suspected. Results: <b>Sternal</b> <b>puncture</b> culture results were positive for all patients with true mediastinitis (n = 23) and negative in 24 of 26 patients without mediastinitis. In addition, <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture</b> allowed diagnosis of mediastinitis with a shorter delay (9 ± 5 days vs 13 ± 8 days, P =. 04) and caused {{a reduction in the}} length of mechanical ventilation (3 ± 4 days vs 10 ± 13 days, P =. 02) and stay {{in the intensive care unit}} (9 ± 7 days vs 18 ± 15 days, P =. 02) compared with that found in another group of patients (n = 20) operated on for true mediastinitis on the basis of the presence of classic, delayed, clinical signs. Conclusions: Our study shows that <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture</b> is a rapid and safe method to ensure the diagnosis of poststernotomy mediastinitis. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2003; 125 : 611 -...|$|E

40|$|Anaemias {{characterized}} by a macrocytic peri-pheral blood picture may be divided {{on the basis of}} <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture</b> findings into two main groups ac-cording to whether the marrow picture is megalo-blastic or normoblastic. A megaloblastic marrow picture, which is seen in its typical form in relapsed cases of Addisonian pernicious anaemia, may be recognized by the following features (see fig. 1) :-A high proportion of the red cell precursors are large cells with abundant dark-blue cytoplasm and large finely reticulated nuclei in which nucleolar remnants {{may or may not be}} present.

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility with <b>sternal</b> bone marrow <b>puncture</b> in chronic kidney disease (CKD) using only local anesthesia and check if the cytological analysis is helpful to determine the hematological status. We found that erythroid hypoplasia occurred only in terminal CKD patients, and that the bone marrows of dogs with CKD stages 2 and 3 were quantitatively similar to those of elderly dogs. All dogs tolerated the bone marrow puncture using only local anesthesia with lidocaine and bone marrow cytological evaluation may be a useful tool for hematopoietic evaluation of anemic dogs with CKD...|$|R

40|$|The sternal foramen is a {{well-known}} variant of the sternum that carries the risk of life-threatening complications like pneumothorax, injury to vital structures like pericardial and cardiac puncture during acupuncture. A foramen was found in one sternum during the routine bone study of bones of the bank which were secured in Department of Anatomy. It was oval shaped measuring 8. 75 mm × 7. 35 mm, present in lower one-third {{of the body of}} the sternum. Distance from a sternal angle was 68. 06 mm and 25. 26 mm from {{the lower end of the}} sternum. The sternal foramen is usually asymptomatic found incidentally on chest X-ray.

40|$|The needles most {{commonly}} used for obtaining bone marrow aspirates from the sternum are the Salah and Klima needles. They were designed in the 1930 s, and except for the introduction {{of different kinds of}} stops and guards there has been no change in their basic structure and design. These instruments are small, do not fit properly in the operator's hand, and the lack of a T-bar handle often makes them difficult to manoeuvre; their introduction into the sternum by twisting or rotary movement of the hand can be cumbersome. To overcome all of these disadvantages an instrument was designed which is larger, provides better grip, and offers improved maneuverability. The stilette of this aspiration needle has a domed handle which rests snugly in the operator's hand and affords operator comfort, while the specially shaped large T-bar handle at the proximal end of the needle provides adequate and firm grip and also ensures precise control during the <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture</b> procedure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The authors {{report a}} {{retrospective}} study of 15 patients with solitary vertebral plasmacytoma. 15 patients were considered {{in this study}} {{on the basis of}} the following characteristics: 1) histologically confirmed plasmacytoma following surgical removal; 2) existence of a single vertebral lesion, documented by skeletal and MRI scan; 3) no signs, at diagnosis of disseminated disease by blood laboratory test, urine analysis, <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture,</b> iliac bone marrow biopsy, a total-body CT scan. The clinical course of the patients has been analysed {{on the basis of the}} following factors: age, sex, length of clinical history before diagnosis, site, presence/absence of the M component. The M component is an electrophoretically homogeneous immunoglobin. The most significant factors for predicting development of multiple myeloma proved to be the presence /absence of the M component at diagnosis and, to a lesser degree, the age of the patient. In the light of other reports too, it would seem that the presence of the M component at diagnosis is a reflection of aggressive biological and clinical tumour behaviour...|$|E
40|$|IN {{the past}} decade the {{introduction}} and widespread application of sternal aspiration {{for the study of}} the living bone marrow have given the clinician a simple and practical method of studying hemopoiesis during life. This method of examining bone marrow has come into favor because of the ease of securing material and the great value of the information obtained. Bone marrow biopsy, although preferable to the simple aspiration method because the marrow architecture is preserved, is a surgical procedure requiring an operating room set-up and several days for the preparation of the material. <b>Sternal</b> <b>puncture,</b> on the other hand, is a simple bed-side procedure, easily tolerated by the patient, and in most instances it yields sufficient informa-tion for diagnosis. Occasionally repeated punctures may be necessary in a given case before a correct diagnosis can be made, but as a rule no ill ef-fects are caused patients by such repetitions. This ease of performance, the satisfactory material obtained, and the fact that the composition of the sternal marrow may be taken as representative of the whole mass of th...|$|E

Therefore, the DNA content of isolated bone marrow cell suspensions from 7 calves, 7 cows and 14 humans was assayed by flow cytometry, Bovine sternal bone marrow samples were collected within 30 min of death, and human marrow samples were collected by <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture</b> and aspiration.

30|$|Results: Among {{the twelve}} cases, there were as many men as women. Mean age was 47.2  years. An {{immunosuppression}} factor {{was found in}} 41.7 % cases. Clinically, all patients had fever. A deterioration of the general condition was observed in 9 cases. Tumor syndrome was found in 50 % of patients. Biologically, cytopenia was noted in 11 cases—bicytopenia in 7 cases and pancytopenia in 4 cases. Hepatic cytolysis was observed in 10 patients, hyperferritinemia in 11 cases and hypertriglyceridemia in 11 cases. Cytological examination of bone marrow confirmed hemophagocytosis in 9 cases (3 patients had refused <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture).</b> The causal infection was of bacterial origin in 58 % of cases—three cases of tuberculosis, one case of brucellosis, one case of rickettsial disease, one gram-negative bacilli septicemia and one staphylococcal septicemia. The viral origin was found in 5 patients— 2 cases of EBV infection, one case of CMV infection, one HSV infection in one case and one case of HIV infection associated with candidiasis. A specific etiological treatment was initiated in all patients, with a favorable outcome in 83 % of cases. However, we deplore two deaths. They were immunocompromised patients.|$|E
40|$|Sternal {{foramina}} {{may pose}} a great hazard during <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture,</b> due to inadvert-ent cardiac or great vessel injury. They {{can also be}} misinterpreted as osteolytic lesions in cross-sectional imaging of the sternum. On the other hand, variant xiphoid mor-phology such as bifid, duplicated, or trifurcated may be mistaken for fractures during imaging. The distribution of these anomalies differs between populations, but data from Africans is scarcely reported. This study therefore aimed to investigate the distri-bution and frequency of sternal foramina and variant xiphoid morphology in a Ken-yan population. Eighty formalin-fixed adult sterna (42 males [M], 38 females [F]) of age range 18 – 45 years were studied during dissection at the Department of Human Anatomy, University of Nairobi.

40|$|Most {{observations}} {{of the process of}} pyknosis, generally considered to be a reflection of nuclear degeneration, have been confined to morphological changes and little is known of the chemical alterations involved. A microspectrophotometric technique, with which quantitative measurements of cell constituents can be made, {{has been found to be}} applicable to a cytochemical study of pyknosis [...] in this case, the physiological pyknosis of erythropoiesis in which the primitive erythroblast nucleus shrinks, loses its delicate reticular structure, and becomes through successive stages the densely staining, clumped nucleus of the normoblast. Leuchtenberger (1), using a similar technique, followed the nucleoprotein changes attending nuclear pyknotic degeneration in mouse sarcoma 180. Thorell (2) studied the red cell maturation process cytochemically, but concerned himself primarily with cytoplasmic alterations. The present study had a threefold purpose: (1) to learn whether blood smears are measurable microspectrophotometrically; (2) to compare erythropoietic pyknosis with that accompanying necrosis; (3) to determine the fate of the red cell nucleus during maturation. Material and Methods Human bone marrow was obtained by <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture,</b> without anticoagulant. 1 The marrow was spread in as uniform a manner as possible on ordinary glass slides. These were then air-dried, fixed in absolute methyl alcohol for 3 to 5 minutes, and dried again. The slides were stained with Unna-Pappenheim's phenol-methyl green mixture for 45 minutes at 56 °C.

40|$|Point-of-care kits to {{concentrate}} bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are used clinically in horses. A maximal number of MSCs per ml of marrow aspirated might be desired prior {{to use of}} a point-of-care system {{to concentrate}} MSCs. Our objective was to test a method {{to increase the number}} of MSCs per ml of marrow collected. We collected 2 BM aspirates using 2 different collection techniques from 12 horses. The first collection technique was to aspirate BM from a single site without advancement of the biopsy needle. The second collection technique was to aspirate marrow from multiple sites within the same <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture</b> by advancing the needle 5 mm 3 times for BM aspiration from 4 sites. Numbers of MSCs in collected BM were assessed by total nucleated cell count (TNCC) of BM after aspiration, total Colony-Forming-Unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) assay, and total MSC number at each culture passage. The BM aspiration technique of 4 needle advancements during BM aspiration resulted in higher initial nucleated cell counts, more CFU-Fs, and more MSCs at the first passage. There were no differences in the number of MSCs at later passages. Multiple advancements of the BM needle during BM aspiration resulted in increased MSC concentration at the time of BM collection. If a point-of-care kit is used to concentrate MSCs, multiple advancements may result in higher MSC numbers in the BM concentrate after preparation by the point-of-care kit. For culture expanded MSCs beyond the first cell passage, the difference is of questionable clinical relevance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{tested the}} hypothesis, that intramyocardial {{injection}} of mononuclear bone marrow cells combined with {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) surgery improves tissue viability or function in infarct regions with non-viable myocardium as assessed by nuclear imaging techniques. Methods Thus far, 7 patients (60 ± 10 [SD] years) undergoing elective CABG surgery after a myocardial infarction were included in this study. Prior to sternotomy, bone marrow was harvested by <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture.</b> Mononuclear bone marrow cells were isolated by gradient centrifugation and resuspended in 2 ml volume of Hank's buffered salt solution. At the end of CABG surgery 10 injections of 0. 2 ml each were applied to the core area and borderzones of the infarct. Global and regional perfusion and viability were evaluated by ECG-gated 99 m Tc-tetrofosmin myocardial single-photon emission computed tomograph (SPECT) imaging and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in all study patients Results Non-viable segments indicating transmural defects were identified in 5 patients. Two patients {{were found to have}} non-transmural defects before surgery. Concomitant surgical revascularisation and bone marrow cell injection was performed in all patients without major complications. The median total injected mononuclear cell number was 7. 0 × 10 7 (range: 0. 8 – 20. 4). At 3 months 99 m Tc-tetrofosmin SPECT and 18 F-FDG-PET scanning showed in 5 patients (transmural defect n = 4; non-transmural defect n = 1) no change in myocardial viability and in two patients (transmural defect n = 1, non-transmural defect n = 1) enhanced myocardial viability by 75 %. Overall, global and regional LV ejection fraction was not significantly increased after surgery compared with the preoperative value. Conclusion In CABG surgery patients with non-viable segments the concurrent use of intramyocardial cell transfer did not show any clear improvement in tissue viability or function by means of non-invasive bioimaging techniques. </p...|$|E
40|$|The smear {{specimens}} of bone marrow and peripheral blood were stained with Prussian blue reaction technique for demonstration of iron, and were studied {{to determine the}} rates of occurrence of sideroblasts and siderocytes in them. The {{specimens of}} bone marrow had been obtained by <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture</b> from a total of 190 individuals including normal, healthy persons. At the same time, the specimens of bone marrow were made into sections, {{and the amount of}} stainable iron in each section was also determined and compared with one another. In normal, healthy individuals the rate of occurrence of sideroblasts ranged froim 9 to 57 per cent. The percentage was lowered in persons deficient in iron, while it was elevated in individuals with a surplus of iron or with disturbance of hemoglobin synthesis. Except in persons with infectious diseases, the amount of stainable iron in the section of bone marrow behaved in the same mariner as the rate of occurrence of sideroblasts. Persons with infectious diseases showed symptoms of iron deficiency clinically, and a small number of sideroblasts were detected in the smear specimens of bone marrow, though there was plenty of stainable iron in the sections of bone marrow. Persons who were free from iron deficiency and who had high degree of erythropoiesis, except those who had undergone splenectomy, were shown to have a greater number of siderocytes. This observation will show that siderocytes are young erythrocytes. It seemed that splenectomy caused disturbance of hemoglobin synthesis, so that stainable iron could be detected even in ripe erythrocytes of persons operated on. It was presumed that stainable iron to be detected in erythroblasts and reticulocytes would be located at mitochondria. This has not, however, been confirmed electron microscopically...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} of anemia with pregnancy is well recognized. In this country the anemia is commonly due to iron deficiencies and is hypochromic. In the tropics a macrocytic, hyperchromic anemia of pregnancy has attracted attention {{and has been}} the subject of many recent investigations. Its counterpart in the temperate climates, the macrocytic or so-called pernicious anemia of pregnancy, has been considered a relatively rare dyscrasia. ', The macrocytic anemia of pregnancy was first recognized over a century ago when Channing 2 reported ten fatal cases. In 1919 Osler 7 differentiated the so-called pernicious anemia of pregnancy from typical Addisonian anemia by pointing out that when recovery from the former disease took place it was permanent and the woman might escape it in subsequent pregnancies. In macrocytic anemia of pregnancy the peripheral blood picture may vgry from one identical with that of true pernicous anemia to one lacking all characteristic features of this anemia. 1 13 On the other hand, examination of the bone marrow reveals pictures identical with those found in true Addisonian pernicious anemia and clearly indicates that macrocytic anemia of pregnancy has for its immediate cause arrested maturation of the megaloblasts. The two features which may be relied upon for the certain diagnosis of macrocytic anemia of pregnancy are the appearance of megaloblasts in the peripheral blood and the finding of a megaloblastic change in the bone marrow. 1 If the peripheral blood picture is not diagnostic, bone marrow biopsy by means of <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture</b> is necessary or some cases will be missed. The following features serve to differentiate the macrocytic anemia of pregnancy from the true Addisonian pernicious anemia: the presence of free hydrochloric acid in gastric juice either without or after histamine injection, a lower frequency and the degree of macrocytosis an...|$|E
40|$|MALIGNANT {{cells have}} been found in the bone marrow by many workers but have usually been {{considered}} to occur only in cases of advanced malignancy, and particularly in those in whom there is radiological evidence of bone metastases, (Stoger, 1941; Franke, 1942). In consequence <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture</b> has been only rarely advocated as a diagnostic procedure in malignant disease. Recent advances in surgery and anaesthetics and the development of new techniques in radiotherapy and chemotherapy have made it important to assess patients who have a restricted primary growth from those with metastases. Sternal marrow examination by aspiration is now a simple procedure which may be undertaken without fear on out-patients and, in consequence, it was considered to be a possible method for searching for secondary spread. Although Reich in 1935 reported the finding of carcinoma cells in bone marrow aspiration in one patient the first large study was that of Rohr and Hegglin (1936) who in a series of patients with advanced malignant disease found 10 positive aspirations among 74 examined. Since this time many reports have appeared in the literature of the finding of malignant cells. These findings have however been largely made on patients with advanced disease and of the 338 positive marrows reported in the papers only 40 were found in patients with negative radiological findings (Pillers, 1955). Leitner (1949) has reviewed the main papers relating to this subject. In consequence further review here seems unnecessary. The present investigation was undertaken to find answers to the following problems. 1. What are the characteristics feature of malignant cells in the marrow and how may they be distinguished from other cells seen only rarely in marrow punctures. 2. Whether it is possible to find tumour cells in the sternal marrow in patients with clinically localised malignant tumours. 3. Whether there are any characteristic changes detectable in the bone marrow with malignant spread other than the finding of tumour cells. 4. To assess the value of sternal marrow examination in assessing the prognosis and deciding on the form of treatment to be given to patients with malignant disease...|$|E
40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1964. Bibliography: leaves [80]- 86. vi, 86 l mounted illusWhen {{working with}} a {{continuous}} line of human cells, it is particularly useful {{to be able to}} secure an adequate supply of normal primary tissue of the same kind. Thus genetic characteristics such as chromosome constitution and {{the presence or absence of}} certain enzymes can be compared in the primary and continuous cells. With such epithelioid lines as Chang liver (Chang, 1954) or the several lines derived from human marrow by <b>sternal</b> <b>puncture</b> (Szybalski, 1963), the securing of comparative primary tissue is troublesome. By contrast human amnion cells are easy to obtain in large quantities from normal placentae. The number of continuous lines of spontaneously altered human amnion cells that have been reported in the literature is surprisingly small. Only five are listed by Hayflick and Moorhead (1962) and only three have appeared with any frequency; the FL line (Fogh and Lund, 1957) the WISH amnion (Hayflick, 1961) and the Fernandez line (Fernandez, 1958). Not all of these are equally useful, e. g., one investigator (Loh, personal communication) has found the FL cell to be somewhat poor in cultural properties for virological studies. It is therefore believed that continuous lines of spontaneously altered human amnion cells with favorable growth characteristics and relatively minimal fastidious care can be extremely useful in studies of human genetics in vitro, and in other areas of inquiry. The purpose of this report is to describe in detail such a line of cells, the RA cell. A brief description could be given in a paragraph, relating the origin of the cells and stating the medium required for their cultivation. In fact, a considerable number of cell lines have appeared in the literature with little or no description. This occurrence seriously limits their usefulness, however. In this regard it is of interest that some recent studies of some well-known cell lines, using immunological and cytogenetic methods have yielded rather surprising results. Brand and Syverton (1962) found that 17 lines of cells supposedly derived from human, monkey, rabbit, swine, calf, hamster and duck tissues did in no case belong to the supposed species of origin but were either mouse or human cells. Several otherwise excellent genetic studies have appeared where the cell being used could simply no longer be identified (Lieberman and Ove, 1959, 1959 a). It is believed, therefore, that a more extensive description of the RA cell is justified. In addition to the merely descriptive material, experimental studies with the RA cell reported here indicate the cell can be very useful for several aspects of cell culture genetics, including cytogenetic, x-ray resistance and enzyme studies...|$|E
40|$|Haematology is {{a medical}} field. It is the study ofblood cells. It studies blood cells {{from the point of}} their morphology, {{quantity}} and function. The clinical haematology focuses on the irregularities in a patient´s blood and studies how the irregularitiesdiffer from the patient´s normal physiological condition. Due to this work haematology can help with diagnosis of other diseases. In haematology many investigative methods are used. One of them is aspiration and biopsy of bone marrow which is a hematopoietic tissue daily producing a large number of blood cells. Unless the formation of blood cells is sufficient enough, the disabled person may be at risk of their life. When the function of bone marrow is affected the patient may be impinged by serious infections, anemia risk or bleeding tendency. Bone marrow is examined for suspicion of haematological or oncology illnesses. Therefore, it has a very important rolein diagnosis of these. It is performed bya prolonged fever, mainly among the people who have a bad immune system. For blood collection are used investigative methodswhich consist ofaspiration and percutaneous bone marrow biopsy. These physical examinations provide some pieces of information about the condition and the ability of the blood cells´ production of bone marrow. Very important part of this physical examination is a specific nursing care. This bachelor´s thesis is focused on the specific nursing care of the patients who undergo the examinations of bone marrow. This thesis mainly includes the methods of bone marrow harvest, how the patients are informed about the examination of bone marrow,the patients´ nursing care after the operation and the role of a nurse at the haematological ward. The introduction of the theoretical part involves physiology of bone marrow and the study of haematology. The other parts discuss indication for bone marrow examination, haematological and oncological illnesses, bone marrow aspiration or percutaneous biopsy of bone marrow. The large part of the thesis deals with bone marrow aspiration, the process of the operation and the nursing care. It also focuses on percutaneous biopsy of marrow bone where the meaning of the examination and the process of bone marrow harvest operation are explained. At the end of the theoretical part a collection of hematopoietic stem cells from particular peripheral blood in mentioned. The aim of the bachelor thesis was to find out certain specifics of nursing care of the patients who undergo the examination of bone marrow. The following research questions were selected: What are the specifics of nursing care of the patients who undergo trepanobiopsy? What are the specifics of the patients who undergo aspiration (<b>sternal</b> <b>puncture)</b> ? What are a preparation and assistance of a nurse during the examination of bone marrow? Which roles does the nurse have during the examination of bone marrow? How are the patients informed about the bone marrowexamination? The practical part includes results from a quantitative survey which was a semi-structured interview. The resulting interviews were written and then were processed by a certified coding technique. The research group comprised six nurses working in the haematological ward and six patients who have undergone the examination of bone marrow. Regarding the gathered results, an information brochure was put forward {{as a part of the}} thesis (see Annex number 5) and was oriented especially at patients undergoing the bone marrow examination.
