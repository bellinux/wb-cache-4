40|$|I {{estimate}} the decomposition of {{total factor productivity}} (TFP) <b>shocks</b> by two sectors: (a) investment and (b) consumption.

I find that surprise <b>shocks</b> to investment sector drive recession in short run. In contrast, positive comovements in response to TFP news <b>shocks</b> to investment sector immediately trigger economic boom. A two-sector DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) model confirms that price rigidity of investment goods is a key factor to generate {{the responses to the}} sector-specific TFP surprise <b>shocks</b> and news <b>shocks</b> as the empirical response: high rigidity for the surprise <b>shocks</b> and low rigidity for the new <b>shocks.</b> This result suggests that the model should adjust with the degree of the price rigidity depending on the surprise <b>shocks</b> or the news <b>shocks...</b>|$|R

Whereas both <b>shocks</b> may raise the nominal interest rate on impact, the inflation and output responses of the two <b>shocks</b> are different.

5|$|Development of System <b>Shock</b> 2 {{began in}} 1997 when Looking Glass Studios {{approached}} Irrational Games {{with an idea}} to co-develop a new game. The development team were fans of System <b>Shock</b> and sought to create a similar game. Early story ideas were similar to the novella Heart of Darkness. In an early draft, the player was tasked with assassinating an insane commander on a starship. The original title of the game, according to its pitch document, was Junction Point. The philosophy of the design was to continue to develop {{the concept of a}} dungeon crawler, like , in a science fiction setting, the basis for System <b>Shock.</b> However, the press mistook System <b>Shock</b> to be closer to a Doom clone which was cited for poor financial success of System <b>Shock.</b> With Junction Point, the goal was to add in significant role-playing elements and a persistent storyline as to distance the game from Doom.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} expansionary technology <b>shocks</b> (<b>shocks</b> that increase labor productivity and factor inputs) as opposed to contractionary technology <b>shocks</b> (<b>shocks</b> that increase labor productivity, but decrease factor inputs). We estimate these two <b>shocks</b> jointly {{based on a minimum}} set of identifying restrictions in a structural VAR. We show that most of the business cycle variation of key macroeconomic variables such as output and consumption is driven by expansionary technology <b>shocks.</b> However, contractionary technology <b>shocks</b> are important to understand the variation in labor productivity and production inputs. In addition, these <b>shocks</b> trigger different reactions of certain variables, which can help explain why existing evidence on technology <b>shocks</b> does not deliver clear results. In a simple DSGE model with managerial technology, which is consistent with our identifying restrictions, we interpret contractionary technology <b>shocks</b> as process innovations and motivate the difference to expansionary technology <b>shocks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Price {{changes and}} output growth, {{both at the}} {{aggregate}} and the sectoral level, appear to be negatively correlated. At a basic level, this suggests that sectoral “supply ” <b>shocks</b> are more prevalent than sectoral “demand ” <b>shocks.</b> However, {{it is not clear}} what these sectoral price-output correlations mean once one thinks in terms of general equilibrium. To help us understand the implication of these price-output correlations, this paper examines a multi-sector dynamic general equilibrium model that includes sectoral technology <b>shocks</b> and sectoral demand <b>shocks,</b> as well as aggregate money growth <b>shocks.</b> We show that while a model driven solely by sectoral technology <b>shocks</b> can generate “plausible ” price-output correlations, “demand ” <b>shocks,</b> particularly sectoral demand <b>shocks,</b> are needed for the model to generate the sectoral price-output correlations observed in the data. We also show that technology <b>shocks</b> do not always look like “supply ” <b>shocks.</b> Positive technology <b>shocks</b> to sectors producing goods that are used for investment frequently result in increases in output and prices in other sectors while positive technology <b>shocks</b> to sectors producing goods that are used primarily as intermediate inputs look like supply <b>shocks</b> in other sector...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to examine {{asymmetry}} of <b>shocks</b> and structural differences between the Czech economy and the euro area. For this purpose I use a New Keynesian DSGE model of two economies. Structural differences are examined using the posterior distributions of structural parameters. Results suggest that prices are more sticky in the Czech economy, especially in the non-tradable sector, while wages are more sticky in the euro area. It seems that the ECB smooths less the interest rate and reacts more to the development in output and inflation than the Czech National Bank. It also seems that labor supply in the Czech economy is more elastic than labor supply in the euro area. Asymmetry of <b>shocks</b> is examined using correlations between smoothed <b>shocks</b> obtained from the estimation. The most asymmetric <b>shocks</b> are <b>shocks</b> in government expenditures, labor supply <b>shocks,</b> and productivity <b>shocks</b> in the tradable sector, while the most symmetric <b>shocks</b> are consumption preference <b>shocks,</b> monetary policy <b>shocks,</b> and investment efficiency <b>shocks...</b>|$|R
5|$|If the {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} falls below 90 mmHg {{within days of the}} injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure using a central venous catheter, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases of <b>shock.</b> Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury. The treatment for <b>shock</b> from blood loss (hypovolemic <b>shock)</b> is different from that for neurogenic <b>shock,</b> and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in <b>shock.</b> However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive the spinal cord of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} the longer-wavelength {{afterglow}} emission (ranging from X-ray through radio) that follows gamma-ray bursts is better understood. Any energy released by the explosion not radiated away in the burst itself {{takes the form of}} matter or energy moving outward at nearly the speed of light. As this matter collides with the surrounding interstellar gas, it creates a relativistic <b>shock</b> wave that then propagates forward into interstellar space. A second <b>shock</b> wave, the reverse <b>shock,</b> may propagate back into the ejected matter. Extremely energetic electrons within the <b>shock</b> wave are accelerated by strong local magnetic fields and radiate as synchrotron emission across most of the electromagnetic spectrum. This model has generally been successful in modeling the behavior of many observed afterglows at late times (generally, hours to days after the explosion), although there are difficulties explaining all features of the afterglow very shortly after the gamma-ray burst has occurred.|$|E
