500|$|Raoul Berger, in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, disagrees; {{the words}} of the statute were clear, and the only {{application}} that it could have was unjust. Statutory interpretation allows for the ignoring of unjust extraneous meanings, but what Coke did was nullify the statute as a whole, along with its main intention. John V. Orth, writing in the Constitutional Commentary, concurs: [...] "If that were <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> they not say so? Is it likely that the royal judges, confronting a case involving a statute that had necessarily passed both houses of parliament and received the royal assent, would lightly use the word 'void'?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Government {{efforts to}} lower {{subsidies}} to unprofitable enterprises and {{to shrink the}} money supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the Cuban peso to move {{from a peak of}} 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president Fidel Castro later admitted that many mistakes had been made, [...] "The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, but I would like to ask why we hadn’t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible. The Soviet Union had collapsed, oil was costing $40 a barrel, sugar prices were at basement levels, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> we not rationalize the industry?" [...] Living conditions in 1999 remained well below the 1989 level.|$|E

She also claims {{that she was}} only used for two-thirds of her contracted appearances. She said: [...] "In the 18 months I was in EastEnders, I had no impact. There was nothing that made people sit up and take notice of what Josie was doing. It was like they remembered I was around and threw me a line where I would slide into the bar and say, 'Hello, how are you' and then sit on a stool and say nothing {{for the rest of the}} episode. I came to feel that I was letting the black community down because my character was so empty. People of my own colour often accosted me in public and accused me of playing a token black. I was so little-used that they even wrote me cheques for episodes I never appeared in. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> they not use me? Why are they wasting the taxpayers' money? It was very dispiriting." ...|$|E
