40|$|We {{present a}} {{monolithic}} mechanical metamaterial comprising a periodic arrangement of <b>snapping</b> <b>units</b> with tunable tensile behavior. Under tension, the metamaterial undergoes a large extension caused by sequential snap-through instabilities, and exhibits a pattern switch from an undeformed wavy-shape to a diamond configuration. By means of experiments performed on 3 D printed prototypes, numerical simulations and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how the snapping architecture can be tuned {{to generate a}} range of nonlinear mechanical responses including monotonic, S-shaped, plateau and non-monotonic snap-through behavior. This work contributes {{to the development of}} design strategies that allow programming nonlinear mechanical responses in solids...|$|R
50|$|A common RTG {{application}} is spacecraft power supply. Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power (<b>SNAP)</b> <b>units</b> {{were used for}} probes that traveled far from the Sun rendering solar panels impractical. As such, they were used with Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Galileo, Ulysses, Cassini, New Horizons and the Mars Science Laboratory. RTGs were used to power the two Viking landers and for the scientific experiments left on the Moon by the crews of Apollo 12 through 17 (SNAP 27s). Because the Apollo 13 moon landing was aborted, its RTG rests in the South Pacific Ocean, {{in the vicinity of}} the Tonga Trench. RTGs were also used for the Nimbus, Transit and LES satellites. By comparison, only a few space vehicles have been launched using full-fledged nuclear reactors: the Soviet RORSAT series and the American SNAP-10A.|$|R
50|$|The first {{total failure}} was {{the launch of}} a Nimbus weather {{satellite}} on May 5, 1968 when the Thor veered off course shortly {{after the start of}} the pitch and roll program and was destroyed by Range Safety. This mission was noteworthy because the satellite carried a pair of isotopic power generators known as SNAP (Systems For Nuclear Auxiliary Power). As the possibility of a launch failure had been considered during their design, the power generators were equipped with a very sturdy casing to prevent their radioactive contents from escaping into the environment. After the destruction of Nimbus-B's launch vehicle, Navy crews began an extensive search for the SNAP generators. On September 27, the Nimbus satellite was located in 300 feet of water near the Santa Barbara Islands with the <b>SNAP</b> <b>units</b> nearby. They were successfully fished out of the ocean two weeks later and their protective casings found to be intact. The fuel inside them was taken out and reused in a subsequent Nimbus launch.|$|R

Knapp went on to create a hard rock group 'Hellzappopin' and a softer rock group 'Airwaves' (1976) still with Mark, Mary and newcomers Roo (second guitar)and Phil Hall (philthy).

The market is now reckoned to be worth over $ 20 billion a year. As with most other packaged goods, pharmaceuticals need reliable and speedy packaging solutions that deliver a combination of product protection, quality, tamper evidence, patient comfort and security needs. Constant innovations in the pharmaceuticals themselves such as, blow fill seal (BFS) vials, anti-counterfeit measures, plasma impulse chemical vapor deposition (PICVD) coating technology, <b>snap</b> off ampoules, <b>unit</b> dose vials, two-in-one prefilled vial design, prefilled syringes and child-resistant packs have a direct impact on the packaging.

Her father Jonathan, who {{dumpster}} dives as a hobby, gives her a Chinese music box as a gift. Clare is able to decipher one of the numerous inscriptions on the box as [...] "Seven Wishes." [...] She absent-mindedly wishes for Darcie, her tormentor and school bully, to [...] "rot," [...] at which point Darcie develops necrotizing fasciitis and is admitted into the ICU. That same day, Clare's dog Max dies in her house's crawlspace after seemingly being eaten alive by rats. Realizing that the box has the ability to grant wishes, Clare wishes for Paul, a classmate whom she has a crush on, to fall madly in love with her. Paul proceeds to dump his current girlfriend Lola and begins making obvious advances towards Clare. Meanwhile, Clare's wealthy uncle August dies after slipping in a bathtub and hitting his head. News reaches Jonathan, and Clare makes her third wish of all her uncle's wealth being transferred to her. Surely enough, Jonathan receives a phone call indicating that Clare has received everything, including her uncle's mansion.

40|$|The Swaziland HIV Incidence Measurement Survey 2 (SHIMS 2) was a household-based {{national}} survey conducted between August 2016 and March 2017 {{to measure the}} impact of Swaziland 2 ̆ 019 s national HIV response on HIV incidence and viral load suppression. SHIMS 2 offered household- based HIV counseling and testing with return of results and collected information about uptake of HIV care and treatment services. This is the second survey to estimate national HIV incidence and viral load suppression. Previous measurements were conducted in SHIMS 1 in 2011. SHIMS 2 was led by the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland (GKoS) through the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Central Statistical Office (CSO). The survey was conducted with funding from the U. S. President 2 ̆ 019 s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and through technical assistance and partnership with the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). SHIMS 2 was implemented by ICAP at Columbia University in collaboration with government entities, including the Health Research Unit, Swaziland Health Laboratory Services (SHLS), Swaziland National AIDS Program (<b>SNAP),</b> Health Promotion <b>Unit,</b> Environmental Health Department, and National Emergency Response Council on HIV/AIDS (NERCHA). GKoS local and international development partners participated in steering committees and task teams during study implementation. This project {{is supported by the}} U. S.
