5|$|In November 2004, Brass was {{dismissed}} after a home defeat to Forest Green Rovers, which left York fourth {{from the bottom}} of the table. His assistant Viv Busby took over as caretaker manager before former Derby County coach Billy McEwan was appointed in February 2005. Under McEwan, York avoided relegation to the Conference North, with a 17th-place finish in 2004–05. One-third into 2005–06, York were in second place but poor midseason results saw them <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> table. They pushed for the play-offs after six consecutive wins but finished in eighth place after faltering in the run-in. With 22 goals, Andy Bishop was the Conference National top scorer in 2005–06. Financial problems arose again; a loss of £150,000 was reported for the season, and there were problems meeting the first annual payment of £100,000 to the FSIF. McGill's company JM Packaging made a proposal to the ST to become majority shareholders, and would lend the club £650,000 to cover the current losses and meet the loan repayments for the next five years. ST members approved the proposal in June 2006, and JM Packaging became 75% shareholders, reducing the ST's previous 85% ownership to 25%. York made a good start to 2006–07, and were never out of the top five from early November 2006. They finished the season in fourth place and played Morecambe in the play-off semi-final; after drawing 0–0 at home in the first leg, they were beaten 2–1 at Christie Park in the second leg.|$|E
5|$|Kenseth {{remained}} the {{leader at the}} lap-149 restart; he was followed by Gordon. The fifth caution was deployed twelve laps later when Carpentier was squeezed towards the backstretch outside wall by Newman, causing Carpentier to <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> track and hit the inside wall. Ken Schrader was close by the incident but swerved to avoid damaging his car. During the caution, the leading drivers, including Kenseth, elected to make pit stops for tires. Gordon took the lead and maintained it at the lap-165 restart. Biffle and his teammate Kenseth drove alongside {{each other in a}} battle for second place on lap 166, until Biffle escaped and ran onto the apron on the next lap. Mayfield burst his right-front tire on lap 171, but no debris came off his car, avoiding the need for a caution. Six laps later, Biffle passed Kyle Busch to take fifth place. Riggs experienced oversteer in the fourth turn while running down the inside of Labonte; Franchitti ran into Riggs, causing the sixth caution on lap 179. All of the leaders, including Kenseth, elected to make pit stops for tires. Earnhardt led the field on the lap-183 restart; he was followed by Harvick and Edwards. Gordon moved into fifth place by lap 188. Harvick fell to fourth place when Edwards and Kenseth passed him.|$|E

25|$|Two years later, Premier League club Everton were {{beginning}} to <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> table. David Moyes, by then with Everton, remembered McBride's success with Preston and sought the forward's services. During McBride's three months with the club, he did not disappoint Moyes, scoring four goals in eight games, including his first game with the club, a 4–3 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. He made close friends during the short time with players such as Leon Osman (with whom he still plays soccer) and Richard Wright.|$|E
25|$|Whymper {{and party}} stayed {{an hour on}} the summit. Then they began their descent. Croz descended first, then Hadow, Hudson and Douglas, Taugwalder senior, Whymper with Taugwalder junior coming last. They climbed down with great care, only one man moving at a time. When they were barely an hour from the summit and were all on the rope, Hadow slipped and fell on Croz, who was in front of him. Croz, who was unprepared, was unable to {{withstand}} the shock; they both fell and pulled down Hudson and Douglas. On hearing Croz's shout, Whymper and Taugwalder clasped the rocks; they stood firm but the rope broke. Whymper saw them <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slope, trying with convulsive hands to stop themselves, and then falling from rock to rock and finally disappearing {{over the edge of the}} precipice.|$|E

25|$|A {{storm had}} come up and the seas had grown very heavy, with waves {{crashing}} over the bow. There was only one lifeboat on Wellington and Lieutenant Brown mustered all the men abreast of this except for the radio operator and three men on the pumps. It was his intention to remain with these four until all hope of saving the ship was gone, the other men meanwhile standing by in the lifeboat. One Seneca man and seven Wellington men were lowered with the boat, the others to <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> falls into the boat {{as soon as it}} reached the water. Fearful lest the boat be smashed against the ship by the heavy seas, one of Wellingtons men chopped the painter and the lifeboat with its eight men drifted away rapidly. They tried to row back, but inexperienced in a pulling boat, they were no match for the heavy seas and strong current.|$|E
25|$|Flavor {{delivery}} is extended throughout the mastication process by timed release of different flavor components {{due to the}} physical-chemical properties of many of chewing gum’s ingredients. Entropy is {{a key player in}} the process of flavor delivery; because some gum components are more soluble in saliva than gum base and because over time flavor components desire to increase their entropy by becoming dispersed in the less ordered system of the mouth than in the more ordered system of the gum bolus, flavor delivery occurs. During the first three to four minutes of the chew, bulking agents such as sugar or sorbitol and maltitol have the highest solubility and, therefore, are chewed out first. As these components dissolve in the consumers’ saliva and <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> esophagus, they are no longer retained in the gum base or perceived by the chewer. During the next phase of the chew in the four to six minute range, intense sweeteners and some acids are dissolved and chewed out. These components last slightly longer than the bulking agents because they have a slightly lower solubility. Next, encapsulated flavors are released during either 10-15 minute into the chew or after 30–45 minutes. Encapsulated flavors remain incorporated in the gum base longer because the molecules that they are encapsulated in are more easily held within the gum matrix. Finally, during the last phase of the chew, softeners such as corn syrup and glycerin and other textural modifiers are dissolved, resulting in a firming up of the gum {{and the end of the}} chew.|$|E
500|$|Westley was {{appointed}} manager of League One club Peterborough United on 21 September 2015. He was named as League One Manager of the Month for November 2015 after his team secured 12 points and 14 goals from four league games, which earned him praise for his side's open, attacking play. Despite lifting the [...] "Posh" [...] into the play-off places in January, {{a very poor}} run of form saw Peterborough <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> table and Westley was sacked by Peterborough on 23 April after a 2–0 defeat to Scunthorpe United at London Road left them 14th in the League One table.|$|E

500|$|Gather Together in My Name (1974) is {{a memoir}} by American writer and poet Maya Angelou. It {{is the second}} book in Angelou's series of seven autobiographies. [...] The book begins {{immediately}} following the events described in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, and follows Angelou, called Rita, from the ages of 17 to 19. Written three years after Caged Bird, the book [...] "depicts a single mother's <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> social ladder into poverty and crime." [...] The {{title of the book}} is taken from the Bible, but it also conveys how one black female lived in the white-dominated society of the U.S. following the Second World War.|$|E
500|$|As an {{increasing}} number of players from the FA Youth Cup winning team had established themselves in the first team, the press gave Palace the title of the [...] "Team of the Eighties". The Eagles began the 1979–80 season well and stayed unbeaten longer than any other club in the top flight. They also occupied first place in the top flight for the first and to date only time in the club's history when they demolished an excellent Ipswich Town side managed by Bobby Robson 4-1 at Selhurst Park. Sadly however the young starlets could not keep this form up, and a <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> table resulted in the Eagles finishing thirteenth, which at that point was the club's highest ever finish.|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics, which discuss escapism, are {{constructed}} {{in a way}} resemblant of nursery rhymes. During the chorus, Ellis-Bextor sings [...] "It's just my imagination / Running away / Girl's gotta have a little daydream / It's a secret escape / It's just my imagination / Running away / Don't worry baby, I'm here to stay". Considine highlighted [...] "I could tie up the bed sheets and <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> house / Be gone before the morning comes" [...] as lyrics exemplificative of Ellis-Bextor's [...] "artistic freedom" [...] in Wanderlust. Reviewing the song for Loud and Quiet, Stuart Stubbs wrote that it [...] "sees our protagonist pull herself out of squalor and onto a road of self discovery." [...] The song concludes with a short outro where Ellis-Bextor repeats the line [...] "Don't worry baby, I'm here to stay" [...] twice.|$|E

He does not wish to leave his command, but his friend, fireman Jack Allen, finally induces him to go on the promise that he, Jack, will call later. Perhaps one reason Jack is so accommodating is because he likes [...] sister. Jack pays ardent court to her, and the flame of their affection resists all of young Willie's efforts to put it out. He didn't really mean to try, but he assuredly poured cold water on Jack, for it was in the line of what he regarded as his duty." ...|$|E
500|$|Gneisenau {{was laid}} down on 3May 1935 at the Deutsche Werke in Kiel. She was {{launched}} on 8December 1936, and completed on 21May 1938. During her launch, the ship sustained minor damage to her stern; the chains slowing her <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slipway broke, {{and the ship}} drifted too far and became beached on the opposite shore. After her commissioning, Gneisenau spent {{the first year of}} her career conducting trials and training cruises in the Baltic Sea. The cruises revealed the wetness of the bow and bridge; in January 1939 her [...] "Atlantic bow" [...] was installed. Scharnhorst was laid down at the Kriegsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven, on 16May 1935. She was launched on 30June 1936 and completed on 7January 1939. In mid 1939, the ship conducted trials in the Baltic Sea; as with Gneisenau, the ship's low freeboard necessitated the installation of the [...] "Atlantic bow", which was completed in August 1939. During that refit, a large hangar for the ship's aircraft was added amidships. The ship emerged from the dockyard in October.|$|E
500|$|Gather Together in My Name, {{published}} in 1974, is Maya Angelou's second book in her series of seven autobiographies.

[...] In 1971, Angelou published her first volume of poetry, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), which became a bestseller and {{was nominated for a}} Pulitzer Prize. [...] It was Angelou's early practice to alternate a prose volume with a poetry volume. [...] In 1993, Angelou recited her poem [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961. Through the writing of this autobiography and her life stories in all of her books, Angelou became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. According to scholar Joanne Braxton, it made her [...] "without a doubt... America's most visible black woman autobiographer".|$|E

500|$|The Act next {{establishes}} a uniform duty towards all lawful visitors, thus abolishing {{the distinction between}} contractors, invitees and licensees. Section 2 provides that the occupier extend a [...] "common duty of care" [...] to all lawful visitors, although it keeps the low duty of care towards unlawful visitors such as trespassers. This duty is described as [...] "a duty to take such care as in all {{the circumstances of the}} case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there". The Act allows the occupier to set limits on where the visitor is allowed to go or how long they are allowed to be there, an extension of the common law judgment made by Scrutton LJ in The Calgarth , when he said that [...] "when you invite a person into your house to use the staircase, you do not invite him to <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> bannisters, you invite him to use the staircase in the ordinary way in which it is used".|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the cuts, McCall made a number of changes to his squad during the summer of 2009. His team started the 2009–10 season by going four games without scoring, until they {{recorded}} a 5–4 victory against Cheltenham Town. After the game, McCall said: [...] "That was the youngest, and certainly cheapest, team Bradford have put out {{for a long time and}} I’m really proud of them." [...] City continued by going ten games unbeaten and reached the area semi-finals of the Football League Trophy where they lost to Carlisle United, managed by McCall's friend Greg Abbott, but at the start of 2010 found themselves 16th in League Two and eight points off the play-offs after a run of five defeats in seven games. McCall laid down a challenge to his team to win three of their next four games, saying: [...] "The bottom line is that the players and me personally will get judged on results. And the results aren't good enough." [...] Despite the club's <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> table, he denied he would resign, but it was reported that two late goals from summer signing Gareth Evans to give City a late 2–1 away at Torquay United saved McCall from being sacked. However, defeat to Bury in the club's following fixture was McCall's last game as manager, with McCall saying after the game: [...] "It's time for somebody else to come in and take up the reins and hopefully do well." [...] He won a little more than one-third of his 133games in charge of City. McCall left by mutual consent.|$|E
500|$|Sebastian Vettel {{qualified}} on pole, {{his first}} since the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix. Heikki Kovalainen qualified sixteenth, {{the second time}} Caterham (and its predecessor, Team Lotus) advanced beyond the first qualifying period in dry conditions. [...] Vettel {{went on to win}} the race – becoming the fourth winner in as many races – after spending much of the race defending against Kimi Räikkönen. Having started eleventh, Räikkönen used an extra set of soft tyres to move up through the field. His team-mate, Romain Grosjean, finished third. Grosjean had initially shown the pace to challenge Vettel's lead, but unlike Räikkönen, he did not have an extra set of fresh tyres, and lost touch with the reigning World Champion after the first set of stops. Lewis Hamilton finished eighth, once again hampered by slow pit stops. He was later involved in an altercation with Nico Rosberg that saw Rosberg referred to the stewards for forcing Hamilton beyond the boundary of the circuit while defending his position, but he escaped without penalty. Hamilton went on to finish eighth, while team-mate Jenson Button was forced to retire two laps from the end of the race after reporting an unusual vibration from the differential. Daniel Ricciardo was involved in early contact that saw the Australian driver <b>slide</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> order from sixth at the start to fifteenth by the end of the race, having spent most of the Grand Prix caught behind Vitaly Petrov. Vettel's win gave him a four-point lead in the championship over Hamilton, while Mark Webber's fourth consecutive fourth place secured third overall. Red Bull Racing took the lead from McLaren in the World Constructors' Championship, while Lotus's double podium moved them into third overall.|$|E
