2500|$|The {{omission}} of commonly played {{songs such as}} [...] "Run to the Hills" [...] and [...] "The Trooper" [...] from the 2010 setlist led to some criticism, with the Calgary Herald suggesting that [...] "...striking a more even balance between that new material and the unsinkable, ironclad battleships of yesteryear, would have made an incredibly satisfying show that much greater". Speaking in defence of the band's choice of setlist, Mike Portnoy (then of Dream Theater) said: [...] "I can understand that fans {{want to hear the}} hits, but I can understand that Maiden don't want to be stuck playing the same songs {{for the rest of their}} lives. They put out new music <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to play the new music."

"Well, well, excuse me, Colonel! {{but there}} are some things that drop The tail-board out one's feelings; and the only way's to stop. <b>So</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to see the old man; ah, the rascals! do they, eh?

50|$|When Bounce {{started to}} {{practise}} together they knew pretty soon that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to do something}} more.

At that time they didn’t know that Bounce would last for seven years.|$|R

6000|$|But, {{for some}} reason or other, this {{generation}} {{does not seem to}} care to see God's strength; and those that are yet for to come seem likely to believe less and less in God's power--believe less and less that they are in Christ's kingdom, and that Christ is ruling over them and all the world. They have not faith in the Living Lord. But they must get back that faith, if they wish to keep that wealth and prosperity after which every one scrambles so greedily now-a-days; for those who forget God are treading, they and their children after them, not, as they fancy, the road to riches--they are treading the road to ruin. So it always was, so it always will be. Yet the majority of mankind will not see it, and the preacher must not expect to be believed when he says it. Nevertheless it is true. Those who forget that they are in Christ's kingdom, Christ does not go out of His way to punish them. They simply punish themselves. [...] They earn their own ruin by the very laws of human nature. They must find hope in something and strength in something; and if they will not see that God is their hope, they will hope to get rich as fast as possible, and make themselves safe so. If they will not see that God is their strength, they will find strength in cunning, in intrigue, in flattery of the strong and tyranny over the weak, and in making themselves strong <b>so.</b> <b>They</b> <b>want</b> a present help in trouble; and if they will not believe that God is a present help in trouble, they will try to help themselves out of their trouble by begging, lying, swindling, forging, and all those meannesses which fill our newspapers with shameful stories day by day, and which all arise simply out of want of faith in God.|$|E
6000|$|Hilda, on her part, {{worked hard}} and well {{for the success of}} Ernest's book as soon as it appeared. Nay, she even condescended (not being what Ernest himself would have {{described}} as an ethical unit) to practise a little gentle hypocrisy in suiting her recommendations of 'London's Shame' to the tastes and feelings of her various acquaintances. To her Radical Cabinet minister friend, she openly praised its outspoken zeal for the cause of the people, and its value as a wonderful storehouse of useful facts at first hand for political purposes in the increasingly important outlying Metropolitan boroughs. 'Just think, Sir Edmund,' she said, persuasively, 'how you could crush any Conservative candidate for Hackney or the Tower Hamlets out of that awful chapter on the East End match-makers;' while with the Duke, to whom she presented a marked copy as a sample of what our revolutionary thinkers were really coming to, she insisted rather upon its wicked interference with the natural rights of landlords, and its abominable insinuation (so subversive of all truly English ideas as to liberty and property) that they were bound not to poison their tenants by total neglect of sanitary precautions. 'If I were you, now,' she said to the Duke in the most seemingly simple-minded manner possible, 'I'd just quote those passages I've marked in pencil in the House to-night on the Small Urban Holdings Bill, and point out how the wave of Continental Socialism is at last invading England with its devastating flood.' And the Duke, who was a complacent, thick-headed, obstinate old gentleman, congenitally incapable of looking at any question from any other point of view whatsoever except that of his own order, fell headlong passively into Lady Hilda's cruel little trap, and murmured to himself as he rolled down luxuriously to the august society of his peers that evening, 'Tremendous clever girl, Hilda Tregellis, really. [...] "Wave of Continental Socialism at last invading England with its what-you-may-call-it flood," [...] she said, if I remember rightly. Capital sentence to end off one's speech with, I declare. Devizes'll positively wonder where I got it from. I'd no idea before that girl took such an intelligent interest in political questions. <b>So</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> their cottages whitewashed, do they? What'll they ask for next, I wonder? Do they think we're to be content at last with one and a-half per cent, upon the fee-simple value of our estates, I should like to know? Why, some of the places this writer-fellow talks about are on my own property in The Rookery--"one of the most noisome court-yards in all London," [...] he actually calls it. Whitewash their cottages, indeed! The lazy improvident creatures! They'll be asking us to put down encaustic tiles upon the floors next, and to paper their walls with Japanese leather or fashionable dados. Really, the general ignorance that prevails among the working classes as to the clearest principles of political economy is something absolutely appalling, absolutely appalling.' And his Grace scribbled a note in his memorandum-book of Hilda's ready-made peroration, for fear he should forget its precise wording before he began to give the House the benefit of his views that night upon the political economy of Small Urban Holdings.|$|E

5000|$|Moves {{management}} {{is a term}} used primarily with the non-profit sector in relationship to donor development.

50|$|The {{band was}} known for having an all-ages policy at almost every concert which it headlined. This meant that they would often choose to play at {{unconventional}} locations such as basements, Jaycee halls, and college auditoriums, {{rather than at the}} traditional 18+ or 21+ (alcohol-serving) music clubs. They did this because they frequented all-ages shows in Olympia as teens, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to let fans of any age attend their own gigs.|$|R
50|$|Band was in {{that time}} playing mostly local shows, which gave them {{motivation}} {{and they decided to}} move forward in more global way. The time between 2012 and 2013 was hard for the band because of changes on posts of singer. Alexandra has left band twice but in 2013 whe has been replaced by charming Raylyn Shayde. Anthology was still considered as young starting band, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to stop this by bringing new elements into their new album.|$|R

The UGCCWU had broken away from the United Mine Workers of America in September 1942, and won a charter from the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).

5000|$|In October 2004, the Maoists {{ordered the}} closure of all private schools in Sandhikharka, {{as well as the}} rest of Arghakhanchi District.

According to schoolchild Pratiba Acharya, [...] "Maoists thought that only rich people study in {{boarding}} schools like mine, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to close them." [...] Further, they destroyed schools who were operated by their enemies and those they disagreed with, after trying to change their curricula was to no avail. Many students were sent to public schools, which teach in Nepali. This posed two problems. For one thing, Nepali, though widely spoken and understood, is not invariably the mother tongue of all students in multilingual, multi-ethnic Nepal. In addition, private school students are accustomed to English as the primary medium of instruction.|$|E

According to Cuse, the plot twist had become a Lost characteristic <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to surprise the audience by having the Shannon-Boone relationship be sexual in nature. The idea for the two came from an observation that their bickering resembled an older married couple; to support this, they made the characters step-siblings as it had not yet been established what their sibling bond exactly was.|$|R

It was to have been named the Borneo or Galileo, to differentiate it with the previous LM003. The idea was taken to SZ Design, an offshoot of Zagato, but it never went past a few concept drawings that looked vaguely similar to a modern Range Rover.|$|R
