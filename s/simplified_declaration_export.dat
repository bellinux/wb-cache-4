This report has Värnamo {{municipality}} as principal and shall clarify what the estate owner in general and Värnamo municipality in particular {{need to know about}} this law. Another part {{that is going to be}} dealt with is how large the future need for energy experts in this field will be, and which competence that will be demanded for them. The work will in general deal with <b>simplified</b> energy <b>declarations</b> for apartment houses and public buildings, since these buildings are the first to be involved with energy declarations. The energy declaration will consist of a number of important components. • Energy power i. e. how much energy the building consume • If the ventilation control is done • If the radon measurement is carried out • Recommendations of measures to improve the energy power • Reference value to compare the buildings energy power against According to the law the declaration shall been made by an independent expert, which will need certain information for this. The estate owner will need to collect some of this information. To simplify the collection of information a model was developed that can be used by the estate owner. The model was tested on Trälleborgskolan in Värnamo. It worked well because energy statistics were available from Värnamo municipality estate department. Regarding the energy consumption monthly statistics were also available which was desirable. Some improvement can been made by correlate the heat consumption for a normal year. There will be an estimated need for about 500 - 1000 energy experts to work with energy declarations in the future. The requirements on these experts are apart from the right education, also a couple of years of experience from the energy business. This can be hard to fulfil for a newly examined engineer. This report focuses on the <b>simplified</b> energy <b>declaration.</b> In a couple of years when building will need to be inspected more thoroughly, there might be a need for more information to be collected.

International Trade in Goods and Services (FT- 990) series. These transactions, valued at less than $ 2, 500, do not legally require the filing of <b>export</b> <b>declarations.</b> As a result, they are often not captured in the administrative records data used to construct FT- 990 estimates. By comparing industry-level estimates created from the ASM to related FT- 990 estimates, this paper estimates that the undercounting of low-valued transactions in the FT- 990 export series increases by roughly $ 30 billion over the period of 1994 - 1997. It also finds that regression analysis provides little insight into the undercounting issue as results are primarily driven by industries whose contributions to total manufacturing exports are small.

Methodology/methodsThe methods of induction, deduction, analysis, synthesis, statistical observation and grouping have been used in the research process. The aim of the scientific work is to determine the principles for improving the statistical registration of commodity at the customs in Georgia. ResultsCountries of origin are not yet completely reflected in the cargo-customs declaration at the Georgian customs; the field ``means of transport at the border'' in the cargo-customs declaration is not filled in; data on estimated market value of the means of transport in the databases of Service Agency of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia is not complete; detailed coding of imported vehicles is carried out incorrectly; the <b>simplified</b> customs <b>declarations</b> are not completely filled in with reference to countries, 11 -digit item coding and value. In terms of registration, certain problems are caused by the fact that a sender and a country of final destination are not always filled out in the declaration. Problems exist in producing foreign trade price indices, the issue being that he information on foreign trade statistics is classified according to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System while price indices are calculated according to the classification of types of economic activity on the 4 -digit level; in filling in declarations there are frequent errors related to registration of commodity code, weight and additional units of measurement. ConclusionsEmpirical data related to production of Foreign Trade Statistics are characterized with certain errors, as a part of foreign trade operations remains unregistered.

Indeed, independently of any exchange-rate mechanism, the ratio of French to German exports in manufactured goods in current prices dropped by 3. 3 % on average per year between 2000 and 2003. Through a descriptive analysis, we attempt to identify the stylized facts behind Frances poorer trade results relatively to Germany. We base our analysis on OECD international trade statistics (STAN bilateral trade database). In particular, we consider Frances and Germanys <b>export</b> <b>declarations</b> by sector and by partner-country. France lost market shares with respect to Germany in the majority of the manufacturing sectors between 2000 and 2003. These losses were particularly pronounced in the technologically intensive sectors of machines and equipments and transports. Regarding the geographical destination of exports, France has lost market shares relatively to Germany with respect to their two principal partners, i. e. the Euro-zone and the United States.

This requires <b>export</b> <b>declarations</b> for fifteen nuclear activities listed in Annex I, according to the list of controlled items foreseen in Annex II, derived from the NSG Trigger list. The export control legal framework in the European Union is set by Council Regulation 428 / 2009, which sets out the general framework for EU-wide controls on exports, brokering and transit, and introduces controls on intangible technology transfers as foreseen by UN Security Council Resolution 1540. Enforcement by customs is ruled by the Community Customs Code and its recent security amendments, founded on the Commission Decision on establishment of common risk criteria and standards for security and safety risk analysis. This is applied since 1 January 2011, and introduces a strong legal mechanism for the equivalent application of customs controls and treatment of the legitimate trade (AEO) at the EU external borders. It is aimed towards identifying high-risk consignments / goods that could have serious implications on the security and safety of the EU and its citizens, and contains a set of common risk criteria to be applied in the Member States' automated risk analysis systems in order to continuously screen advance electronic cargo information for security and safety purposes.

40|$|With the Additional Protocol (AP) in force, the IAEA has {{strengthened}} {{tools to}} verify the absence of undeclared nuclear activities. The new state level approach being proposed by IAEA envisions an objective based and information driven safeguards approach further utilizing relevant information to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of safeguards. To this goal the IAEA makes extensive use of open source information. Here open source is broadly defined and any information that is neither classified nor proprietary. It includes, but is not limited to: media sources, government and non-governmental reports and analyses, commercial data, and scientific/technical literature. New sources taken into account include trade-related information. JRC has surveyed and catalogued open sources on import-export customs trade data and developed tools for their use in safeguards. Tests {{on the use of}} these data by the IAEA suggest safeguards relevance along the following lines: support the IAEA State evaluation process and improve understanding of a State’s nuclear programme. Verify import and <b>export</b> <b>declarations</b> made by States under Additional Protocols (APs) and Identifying indicators of activities to be safeguarded or to be declared under APs. In the field of open source monitoring, JRC is developing and operating a “Nuclear Security Media Monitor” (NSMM), which is a web-based multilingual news aggregation system that automatically collects news articles from pre-defined web sites. NSMM is a domain specific version of the general Europe Media Monitor (EMM) and monitors – additionally to the 2500 general web news sources targeted by EMM- more than 150 nuclear specific sites (including NGOs, academic, (inter-) governmental and scientific/technical sites). Filters remove articles not relevant to the nuclear domain and group them into various areas of interest, e. g. related to different steps of the nuclear fuel cycle or to relevant countries. NSMM has been established in a joint project with IAEA with the aim to streamline IAEA’s acquisition and analysis of open source information and develop the current information collection/newsletter production process to a more efficient system. The paper will illustrate what are the sources of trade data relevant for nonproliferation and the possible uses to inform verification activities and will present the main aspects of the NSMM also by illustrating some of the uses done internally at JRC.

40|$|In current days, {{separate}} compilation plays a {{very important}} role in the practical program development. As the name “separate compilation ” indicates, it allows that the program is split into several source files. Each of them is self-contained in the sense it describes the import signature which are assumed to be provided by other code fragment and its own <b>export</b> <b>declarations.</b> Each unit can be compiled independently and then linked together as a whole. [1] proposes such an simple but elegant framework to describe the semantics of separate compilation and linking. Given a code fragment with the explicit import interface called linkset, it is compiled to a self-contained entity called intra-checking and then compatible modules can be safely linked together called inter-checking. As for the SML language, many SML compilers support the so-called incremental recompilation system such as the SML/NJ [2] and MLKit[3]. In these compiler systems, the compilation of the source files must be compiled incrementally. The interface of each source file is inferred automatically by the compiler without the interference of programmer. But a weak point of such strategy is that compiler always needs to know the implementation which imposes a really inconvenient situation in practical development. Imagine the following scenario: A and B cooperates to develop a software system and B depends on A. Without the implementation of A, B cannot do any real development. This is a serious obstacle to apply SML language into large scale software development. The ML dialect, Ocaml proposes a solution for cut-off separate compilation[4]. In Objective Caml, compilation units are regarded as a basic unit to be independently compiled and linked later. And each can be seen as special cases of structures and signatures, and the relationship between the units can be explained easily in terms of the ML module system. We use the example given in [4] to illustrate. A compilation unit A comprises two files: implementation file A. ml, consisting a sequence of definitions, analogous to the inside of a struct [...] . end construct; interface file A. mli, which contains a sequence of specifications, analogous to the inside of a sig [...] . end construct. Both files define a structure named A as if the following definition was entered at top-level as follows: module A: sig (* contents of file A. mli *) end...|$|R
40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Master of Business Administration, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 46). A freight forwarder, forwarder, or forwarding agent is a person or company that organizes shipments for individuals or corporations to get goods from the manufacturer or producer to a market, customer or final point of distribution. Forwarders contract with a carrier to move the goods. A forwarder does not move the goods but acts as an expert in supply chain management. A forwarder contracts with carriers to move cargo ranging from raw agricultural products to manufactured goods. Information typically reviewed by a freight forwarder includes the commercial invoice, shipper's <b>export</b> <b>declaration,</b> bill of lading and other documents required by the carrier or country of export, import, and/or transhipment. Nowadays, the freight forwarding is not limited within the same geographical limit of any country. Due to globalization and free market economy, this industry is facing severe competition. As the competition among companies are rapidly increasing, many companies are trying to provide distinct services in terms of air freight forwarding, sea freight forwarding, customs brokerage, consolidation, logistics management, Off-Dock services, household removal, transportation and so on. Novo Cargo is totally committed to provide a total transportation services to their clients irrespective {{of the size of}} consignment. They plan, coordinate, supervise, document and monitor the entire movement system of consignment. As Freight forwarding and logistics service sector is gradually developing to be a huge service sector so I am glad {{to have an opportunity to}} work in Novo cargo Services Ltd. to explore their activities and build up an analytical insight regarding their services. As important freight forwarding and logistics services, Off-Dock offers entire item-wise package of service activities for handling the temporary empty/laden container storage, loading/unloading general export/import goods, and containers under custom clearance. It is an equivalent of a seaport located in the hinterland. Novo Cargo uses Esack depot as a part of Off-Dock facilities which is located adjacent to Chittagong port. Novo Cargo’s dynamic approach to household removal business is well supported by the concerned authorities in Bangladesh. The objective of the company is to deliver reliable, cost effective transportation and management of clients’ goods. Novo Cargo also offers other comprehensive services like air and sea freight, surface services, customs brokerages, cargo management, chartering, consolidation, warehousing and distribution, inland transportation and so on. SWOT, PEST and STP analysis of Novo Cargo are done here to identify its competitive advantage through analyzing its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, find out macro-environmental factors used in the environmental scanning and use the formula of segmentation, targeting and positioning for strategic marketing.
