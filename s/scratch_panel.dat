60|$|The {{kitchen window}} {{proved to be}} insecurely latched. Ukridge threw it open and we climbed in. The dog, hearing the noise, raced back along the passage and flung himself at the door, <b>scratching</b> at the <b>panels.</b> Ukridge listened with growing indignation.|$|R
50|$|Smelly Old History is {{a series}} of {{illustrated}} books published by Oxford University Press. The books contain <b>scratch</b> and sniff <b>panels</b> to provide the reader with an aroma of different smells through the ages. The series was written by Mary J. Dobson and has sold over a million copies around the world.|$|R
60|$|She swore a {{dozen times}} {{that she would not}} leave the Kincaid without her baby, and yet she {{remained}} clothed long past her usual hour for retiring, and her blankets were neatly rolled and bound with stout cord, when about midnight there came a stealthy <b>scratching</b> upon the <b>panels</b> of her door.|$|R
50|$|Sproxil’s service {{places a}} {{security}} label with a scratch-off panel on all protected products. Consumers <b>scratch</b> off the <b>panel</b> at {{point of purchase}} to reveal a unique one-time use code. This {{is a form of}} mass serialization. The code is sent via SMS or mobile app to a country-specific short code, and the consumer receives a reply almost instantly indicating that the product is genuine or suspicious. The company also has a 24/7 call center to provide support during the verification process and take in anonymous reports of suspicious counterfeiting activity.|$|R
5000|$|Coupon {{parking is}} a {{variation}} of pay and display {{without the use of}} machines; instead, the motorist purchases a booklet of coupons in advance from the authorities. To use a parking coupon, the motorist has to completely tear off tabs of the date and time, or <b>scratch</b> off <b>panels</b> on the date and time in which he/she leaves the vehicle. This process is similar to disc parking, except that a parking disc is reusable whereas a coupon can only be used once. In the Republic of Ireland, reusable free-parking discs are unknown and parking coupons are called [...] "parking discs". [...] The coupon is displayed on the dashboard or hung from the top of a door window facing the roadside. Multiple coupons are used if the parking time exceeds the allowance given for a single coupon, though this is not always permitted. The system is widely used in Singapore and Brazil, and in parts of some countries such as New Zealand, Malaysia, Austria, Ireland and Israel.|$|R
50|$|If rust {{is present}} on a body panel, the panel was damaged by a collision, or other damage is present, {{there are several}} options for repair: fix the damaged panel (minor damage), {{replacement}} (excessively damaged panels), or cutting out and replacing {{a portion of the}} panel (moderate damage - for many makes of vintage car, small partial patch panels are available and designed to be welded into place after the damaged portions are cut out). Although this may seem simple in principle, in practice it is highly skilled work. One of the highest skills in restoration is the use of the English Wheel or Wheeling Machine to fabricate complete compound curvature <b>panels</b> from <b>scratch.</b> Many <b>panels,</b> (especially if from different sources), may be a problem to fit together and need reshaping to fit together properly. Variation in panel size and shape and 'fettling' by skilled metalworkers on the factory production line to make panels fit well used to be common practice, especially with British and Italian sports cars. Even genuine New Old Stock factory panels may require panel beating skills to fit.|$|R
5000|$|The HTC Desire 820 is a {{mid range}} Android-based {{smartphone}} designed and manufactured by HTC aired and available from November 2014. It is the successor of HTC Desire 816. The smartphone features a 5.5-inch super LCD 2 display with a 1280x720 resolution. Unlike the <b>scratch</b> resistance glass <b>panel</b> of HTC Desire 816, it has Corning Gorilla Glass lll. Desire 820 supports full hd video recording and play back. It offers HTC Sense 6.5. Processor is a ( [...] 1.7 GHz quad core and quad core 1.0 GHz) Qualcomm Snapdragon 615, 64 bit 'ARM CORTEX A53'octa core {{system on a chip}} accompanied by standard 2.0 gb RAM, 16 gb internal memory, 128 gb external memory capacity and a non removable 2600 mAh battery. It {{also comes with}} a 13.0 MP rear-facing camera and 8 MP front-facing camera. The smartphone came with android version 5.01 and Android Marshmallow was released in 2016.|$|R
40|$|Protective {{coatings}} is used {{to enhance}} the corrosion resistance of buried pipelines. However, the effectiveness of epoxy-coatings may be compromised due to inadvertent presence of surface damage and coating disbondment. Additionally, the disbonded coated panels {{is expected to be}} less effective than that of <b>scratched</b> or un-defected <b>panels.</b> This research was designed to evaluate the coating performance of FBE and hybrid epoxy in simulated Arabian Gulf water and synthetic Sabkha. The influence of coating damage and disbondment on corrosion resistance was also investigated. Results of this research indicated a reduction in the adhesion bond between the coatings and substrate. The electrochemical impedance measurements demonstrated the need for an appropriate interpretation of results when this technique is used. The corrosion current density measurements indicated that both media are corrosive. Protective coatings under investigation did not show any blistering effect, loss of adhesion or color change under test conditions, thus reflecting their excellent corrosion resistance property...|$|R
5000|$|Also in this series, the [...] "Phoneplay" [...] {{game was}} introduced. An extra panel {{was added to}} the scratchcard. Players would ring a phone number and would give their details plus the number they {{revealed}} by <b>scratching</b> the extra <b>panel.</b> Those that wanted to enter had to do so by a set time on the Wednesday night after the show to be in the draw with a chance of being one of three players picked at random by the producers to play on the night. They would be rung back and would be on standby when the show would start. After the 5 players for next week would be drawn, Mooney would go to the [...] "Phoneplay" [...] booth and would introduce the three players. They would play over the phone. All {{they have to do is}} choose one of three slots, 'A', 'B' or 'C'. Two contain cash prizes between €1,000 and €2,500, and the other contains the star prize of a new car.|$|R
5000|$|The Richmond Driving Club {{was founded}} in 1838 by Lord Chesterfield. [...] It only lasted until 1845. It used to meet at Lord Chesterfield's house, and drive, in procession, to dinner at the Castle Hotel in Richmond. It was satirized by Robert Smith Surtees: Following his track succeeds a {{numerous}} band,Who vainly drive to work their fours-in-hand.For Richmond bound I view them passing by,Their hands unsteady, and their reins awry.Some <b>scratch</b> their <b>panels,</b> some their horses' knees [...] - Beaufort and Payne, I class you not with these;For who so smartly skins along the plainas Beaufort's Duke? What whip can equal Payne?No matter [...] - [...] dinner comes, when all are ableTo drive their coaches well about the table.Ricardo then can driving feats relate,And Batthyany swear he'd clear the gate;Till midnight closes o'er the festive scene,Then who so bold as ride with Angerstein?He who aloft can mark with unmoved nerveThe wheelers jibbing while the leaders swerve,And sit, al careless, 'mid the wordy warTo lose a pinch-pin, break a splinter-bar. Chaunt of Achilles The Duke of Beaufort, named in the poem, did {{take part in the}} processions, but was not actually a member of the RDC. Mr Angerstein, also named, was a particularly reckless driver, whose reputation led no-one to want to ride with him. An anecdote relates that on one occasion someone unwittingly climbed into Angerstein's carriage after dinner for the ride home. Angerstein, so excited that someone had actually chosen to ride with him, set off immediately, without waiting {{for the rest of the}} procession, and so suddenly that his passenger was thrown head-over-heels. The passenger, realizing whose carriage he had embarked upon, saying nothing jumped straight off.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{work has}} been {{conducted}} at International Automotive Components Group in Torslanda, Sweden. The company produces door panels, instrument panels, consoles and cockpits for the automotive industry. During the production of door panels, defects such as pressure marks and scratches emerge which results in scrap and rework. The objective of the thesis work was to identify the causes of pressure marks and scratches and also to suggest measures {{to reduce the amount}} of scrap and rework on door panels. Through observations, interviews and experiments, several causes leading to pressure marks and <b>scratches</b> on door <b>panels</b> were identified. Small pieces of plastics on fixtures, the operator's rough handling and specific process steps are the main causes that result in pressure marks and scratches. Pressure marks and scratches emerge at several places on the door panels during the production. To reduce the amount of pressure marks and scratches both short-term and long-term measures were suggested. Some of the measures are:  Use vacuum cleaners at some stations  Add padding on unpadded areas and edges  Make new instructions that emphasize to keep production stations clean and to avoid rough handling  Introduce workshops to engage operator...|$|R
