The book was edited by literary critic Christopher Ricks, Julie Nemrow and Lisa Nemrow, to offer variant versions of Dylan's songs, sourced from out-takes and live performances. A limited edition of 50 books, signed by Dylan, was priced at $5,000. [...] "It’s the biggest, most expensive book we’ve ever published, as far as I know," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan</b> Karp, Simon & Schuster’s president and publisher.|$|E
2500|$|The Randolph County Superior Court Minutes of March 20, 1807 recorded: [...] "The Grand Jury {{returned}} {{a bill to}} the Court against Jonathan Lewis for Murder & indorsed thereon a trial bill upon which the <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan</b> Lewis was arraigned, plead not guilty and put himself upon his country." [...] Witnesses for both sides were summoned and a trial date of October 26, 1807 was set in the Guilford County Superior Court. Jonathan was arrested on April 8 and locked in the Randolph County jail. A pre-trial hearing was held October 5 and he was indicted {{for the murder of}} Omi Wise, a single woman. On October 9, he escaped the jail and fled to parts unknown.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{argue that}} it will cause consumers, {{particularly}} those less wealthy and educated, to avoid needed and appropriate healthcare {{because of the cost}} burden and the inability to make informed, appropriate choices. [...] "Consumer-driven healthcare is badly named, because it's certainly not driven by consumers," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan</b> Oberlander. It is [...] "really just shifting the cost of healthcare onto the backs of the patients". People with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, will be hurt, because with a deductible of $3000 to $4000, such people {{will never be able to}} save anything in their savings accounts. [...] "Employers like it because they're going to save money," [...] but they're not going to fund these healthcare accounts adequately, he said. [...] "Conservatives tend to support consumer-driven healthcare. They believe, as do a fair number of health economists, that people use too much healthcare, and use too much healthcare of little value. If you move to high-deductible plans, people will think twice. If I have a sore throat, instead of going to my physician, I'll have a cup of tea instead." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "They {{always take}} us lightly," [...] <b>said</b> {{receiver}} <b>Jonathan</b> Makonnen, who had seven catches for 104 yards. [...] "They really don't respect us. They're a talented team, {{but they were}} kind of lackadaisical out there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, it's my innicent of a brother, sure enough," [...] <b>said</b> honest <b>Jonathan.</b> [...] "A fine {{trouble and}} cost {{he is to}} us, in th' eating and other things, but we must bear what's laid on us." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In {{addition}} to the significant capital investment, the SS&C project will further stimulate downtown redevelopment and create {{just the kind of}} high-paying, professional jobs our community needs as we head into the future," [...] <b>said</b> Mayor <b>Jonathan</b> Weinzapfel.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see horses, Lew. What do {{you make}} out?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan.</b> [...] "It's a bold {{manoeuvre}} for Indians unless they have a strong force." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{take two}} canoes, day after to-morrow," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan,</b> decisively, to Colonel Zane. [...] "Have you a rifle for Wetzel? The Delawares got his." ...|$|E
6000|$|What matters that, <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan,</b> [...] Whose blood {{began to}} freeze, [...] When {{there is one}} above whose eye [...] The deeds of {{darkness}} sees? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Them's the Canadians," [...] <b>Jonathan</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "The redskins never build shelters {{while on}} the war path. There are a heap of redskins about." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Jonathan</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I {{immediately}} realised {{what could}} be made using these home movies - a unique way of telling my father's extraordinary life story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Injuns all around; I guess I'd {{better be}} makin' tracks," [...] <b>Jonathan</b> <b>said</b> to himself, peering out to learn if Wetzel {{was still under}} cover.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, you do," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan</b> Stubbs, [...] "and if you'll {{come and}} dance I'll {{tell you about}} it. The Marchesa {{told me to take}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so to {{miss the}} race?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan</b> sulkily; [...] "I {{thank you for this}} good turn, good Master Jeremy; and hang me if I forget it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, we'll go," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan</b> Zane. [...] "I'll {{guide you}} to Fort Henry." [...] He lifted the pack, and led Nell and Jim {{out of the}} glade.|$|E
6000|$|... "See them maples an' {{chestnuts}} down thar," [...] <b>said</b> Wetzel when <b>Jonathan</b> {{had come}} up, pointing through {{an opening in}} the foliage. [...] "They've stopped fer some reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let them fire," [...] <b>Jonathan</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "It ain't {{every man}} as can shoot {{straight}} from a canoe going at racing pace. The more they fires the better. They will only fall further behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|Therefore Saul said unto Jahveh, the Elohim of Israel, Shew the [...] right. And Jonathan and Saul {{were taken}} by lot: but the people [...] escaped. And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan [...] my son. And Jonathan was taken. And Saul <b>said</b> to <b>Jonathan,</b> Tell [...] me what thou hast done.... And the people rescued Jonathan so [...] that he died not (1 Sam. xiv. 41-45).|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{came very}} near being a dead man," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan,</b> with grim humor. [...] "I {{got a long}} shot at him and killed his big white horse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw Col. Crawford {{burned at}} the stake. I did not see Dr. Knight. Maybe they murdered him before I reached the camp of the Delawares," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Conjuror Fall, t'other side of Casterbridge, {{that they}} used to call 'Wide-O', was a very good man when I was a boy," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan</b> Kail. [...] "But he's rotten as {{touchwood}} by now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] <b>said</b> he, when <b>Jonathan</b> had concluded, [...] "I {{hope that}} you may not have been made the victim of some foolish hoax. Let me see what it is she has confided to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give him another," [...] she <b>said,</b> looking <b>Jonathan</b> in the face; {{and when}} that had been done, {{she walked over to}} the chimney and flung the guilty piece into the reddest of the fire. Its base {{constituents}} began immediately to run; even as she watched it the disc crumbled, and the lineaments of the King became confused. Jonathan, who had followed close behind, beheld these changes from over her shoulder, and his face darkened sorely.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wondered}} what kept you so late," [...] Colonel Zane <b>said</b> to <b>Jonathan,</b> {{as he and}} his companion came up. [...] "You've fetched Mabel, and she's----". The good man could say no more. If he should live an hundred years on the border amid savage murderers, he would still be tender-hearted. Just now he believed the giant borderman by the side of Jonathan held a dead girl, one whom he had danced, when a child, upon his knee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan,</b> [...] "there came {{a strange}} man--a foreigner--who upon his part {{assaulted}} {{me with a}} pistol, with every intention of murdering me and thus obtaining possession of that same little trifle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "D'ye {{think that}} I'd {{forgotten}} you?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan,</b> {{with something like}} a groan; and thereupon his teeth clicked to, and he sat silent with the tankard {{in his hand and}} staring straight before him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} would. I might have lost my scalp tryin' {{to get you}} back home," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan,</b> {{beginning}} to hesitate. Plainly {{he did not know}} what to make of this remarkable young woman.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 March 2015, Jonathan conceded the {{election}} to challenger Muhammadu Buhari, who was sworn in to succeed him on 29 May 2015. <b>Jonathan</b> <b>said</b> in a statement he issued on 31 March 2015 that [...] "Nobody’s ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian." ...|$|R
500|$|Wilson stated, [...] "We didn't have {{a script}} that {{was ready to}} shoot {{on the first day}} of filming", while Pierce Brosnan said, [...] "We had a script that was not {{functioning}} in certain areas." [...] The Daily Mail reported on arguments between Spottiswoode and the producers with the former favouring the Petrie version, but the latter reinstating Feirstein to rewrite it two weeks before filming was due to begin. They also <b>said</b> that <b>Jonathan</b> Pryce and Teri Hatcher were unhappy with their new roles, causing further re-scripting.|$|R
500|$|... Douglas Durst's cousin Jonathan [...] "Jody" [...] Durst, {{with whom}} he {{currently}} shares a co-presidency of the company, {{is in the process}} of taking over the day-to-day operations as president. In an interview with The New York Times, <b>Jonathan</b> <b>said</b> that maintenance of the clock is planned [...] "for years to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "(1.) That {{the court}} shall revoke probate of the said alleged {{will of the}} <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan</b> Meeson, bearing date the 10th day of November, 1885, granted to the {{defendants}} on the 21st day of May, 1886.|$|E
6000|$|... "Old White Tail, if {{you were}} the last buck in the valley, I would not harm you," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan,</b> looking at the panting deer. [...] "You need have no farther fear of that pack of cowards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if this doesn't beat me! I thought I knew {{a little}} about deer," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Jonathan.</b> [...] "Tige, we will save this buck from those gray devils if it costs a leg. Steady now, old fellow, wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And <b>Jonathan</b> <b>said</b> unto David, O Lord God of Israel, when I {{have sounded}} my father about to-morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee; the Lord {{do so and}} much more to Jonathan.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Melinda Houston (The Sunday Age) <b>said</b> that <b>Jonathan</b> {{was one of}} {{the only}} ongoing gay roles on Australian television. [...] Debi Enker from The Age {{believed}} that the show [...] "dialled down the camp flamboyance of a cliched gay BFF" [...] in season two. Their colleague Frances Atkinson branded it a [...] "somewhat cliched role". But Melinda Houston was not impressed with [...] "the camp, promiscuous sidekick with an eagle eye for fashion". She questioned whether all gay men behaved like Jonathan and branded him the show's only [...] "irritant". While Jim Schembri branded him a [...] "critic-baiting" [...] character.|$|R
5000|$|... "We came up {{with the}} design, the {{expertise}} and about 60% of the materials were locally sourced. The engines, generators and navigation equipment came from outside. This {{is the beginning of the}} transformation and I believe in another 10 to 15 years, we can be thinking about starting a project to take Nigerians into the air," [...] <b>said</b> President Goodluck <b>Jonathan.</b>|$|R
