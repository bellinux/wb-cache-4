25|$|Currently {{there are}} two Poisson solvers {{implemented}} in BioMOCA based on the finite difference method. One uses the pre-conditioned Conjugate Gradient scheme (pCG) and is used by default. The later is borrowed from an APBS <b>solver,</b> which uses a V-multi-grid scheme. Other than the numerical approach to solve the Poisson equation, {{the main difference between}} the two solvers is on how they address the permittivity in the system. In the first <b>solver,</b> a dielectric value is assigned to each cell in the grid, while in the APBS <b>solver</b> the dielectric coefficients are defined on the grid nodes. As discussed earlier box integration method is used in the pCG <b>solver,</b> which allows us to treat the Poisson equation in the most accurate way. Even though a full multigrid <b>solver</b> based on box-integration method has been under development, there is a neat way to reuse the already exiting code and treat the ion channel systems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. State {{of the art}} Stochastic Local Search (SLS) <b>solvers</b> have {{difficulty}} in solving many CNF-encoded realistic SAT problems, apparently because {{they are unable to}} exploit hidden structure as well as systematic <b>solvers.</b> Recent work has shown that SLS <b>solvers</b> may benefit from a preprocessing phase borrowed from systematic SAT solving. In this paper, we report an extensive empirical examination of the impact of SAT preprocessing on the performance of contemporary SLS <b>solvers.</b> It emerges that all the examined <b>solvers</b> do indeed benefit from preprocessing, and the effect of each preprocessor is close to uniform across <b>solvers</b> and across problems. Our results suggest that SLS <b>solvers</b> need to be equipped with multiple preprocessors if they are ever to match the performance of systematic <b>solvers</b> on highly structured problems. ...|$|R
