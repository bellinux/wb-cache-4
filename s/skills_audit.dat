40|$|Changes in the United Kingdom higher {{education}} system {{have resulted in}} a lack of formative (i. e., student feedback) assessment: increased student numbers and reduced funding resulting in bigger classes with less tutor contact, as well as a more diverse set of student entrants with a wider set of skills resulting in a greater need for formative assessment.

For responses relating to possession/non-possession of skill the overall extent of change was 11. 96 %. Some questions achieved little or no discrimination between individuals. Exclusion of these questions increased the extent of change to 15. 33 %. The extent to which individual respondents changed between first and second testing ranged from 2 % up to 32 %. For some individuals the change was entirely {{in the direction of a}} reported skills gain, while for others the change reported was entirely a skills loss.

40|$|Today's design {{activities}} are usually conducted in teams of professionals who represent different design domains, e. g. architects and engineers. Within these teams clear and accurate communication {{of design and}} technical concepts and information is critical. A current trend is for the conduct and management of these teams to move towards working more in virtual environments. The use of high bandwidth Information and Communication Technologies (ICT's) is increasing and with this increase {{is the need to}} better understand those generic skills, such as communication, which contribute to the successful application of the ICT hardware and software. Communication skills have been identified as an important factor which may be affected in the transition from co-located team collaboration to the virtual environment. These issues usually manifest themselves in the ability of team members to use both visual and verbal forms of communication concurrently. Also of significance is the importance of "cues" in communication interactions during collaboration, this resulting in less effective achievement of shared understanding among team members. This paper reports on industry based research of both co-located and virtual teams involved in the activity of designing. It concentrates on the communication between team members.

Methods: ‘Kids in the Kitchen’ is a classroom-based program that engages students in preparing FV. Impact evaluation was conducted with students from Grade 1 (around 6 years old) and Grade 5 (around 11 years old) {{who participated in the}} program. A questionnaire was used to collect pre- and post-program data on knowledge, attitudes and consumption of FV, FV preparation skills and environmental supports for FV consumption. A <b>skill</b> <b>audit</b> was also conducted for Grade 1 students. Results: Study participants (n = 118) included 70 Grade 1 and 48 Grade 5 students. There was an increase in the median number of fruits correctly identified (from 14 to 16), tried (from 14 to 16) and liked (from 10. 5 to 12; P = 0. 0001 for all changes). The median number of vegetables correctly identified increased from 10 to 12 (P = 0. 0001), but there was no change in the number of vegetables tried or liked. The proportion of participants who rated their skills in using a knife to prepare FV as ‘not really that good’ decreased by 15 %, from 42 % to 27 % (P = 0. 04). Grade 1 participants’ skills in cutting, grating and peeling improved (P = 0. 0001 for all changes).

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Education, {{training}} and development plays {{a critical role}} in the socio-economic development of any nation. South Africa as a country is faced with ever growing challenges to produce the human resources (HR) that will contribute meaningfully to its economic stability and prosperity. In addition, for the Public Service to succeed in its mandate of providing effective and efficient service delivery for the citizens of the country, it needs to invest in {{training and}} development of its employees. For example, in terms of health services, a hospital is supposed to be comprised of multi skilled personnel so that it is able to deliver a package of health services to its population. In the Lehurutshe/Zeerust District Hospital Complex it is necessary to assess the skills of employees and develop them where necessary. Aims: To describe the levels of education and training of employees working in Lehurutshe/Zeerust Hospital Complex in 2011 and their future training needs to inform the skills development plan (SDP) for the Hospital Complex Methodology: A cross sectional study design based on a retrospective record review was used for this study.

40|$|Changes in {{business}} environments have challenged the competencies (technical knowledge, skills and attitudes) of professional accountants. Accounting professions have responded by developing competency frameworks. In 2008, the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) issued a draft competency framework encapsulating {{a broad range}} of knowledge, skills and attributes. The objective of the study reported on here was to determine training officers’ perceptions of the knowledge and skills requirements of entry-level trainee accountants. SAICA could consider {{the findings of this study}} in the finalisation of its competency framework. The study reveals that nearly three-quarters of all the topics in the current prescribed SAICA syllabus are considered to make at least an important contribution to the knowledge requirements of entry-level trainee accountants. Although more than half the management accounting topics prescribed in the SAICA syllabus are perceived as being only reasonably important, further statistical analysis revealed that TOPP (training outside public practice) training officers disagreed significantly with their TIPP (training inside public practice) counterparts on the importance of management accounting topics and perceived them to be at least important. Except for specialised topics, all other topics covering the remaining core subjects (Financial Accounting, Financial Management, Taxation and Auditing) were perceived to be important or even more than important by the respondents. The study demonstrates that there is a movement towards an expanded set of competencies beyond the technical knowledge typically taught to prospective CAs, and that there is evidence of a need for today’s entry-level trainee accountants to receive training in communication, analytical, interpersonal and computer skills.

40|$|It {{has always}} been {{challenging}} to develop appropriate and effective strategies for assessment of student learning. The move by professional bodies and universities to an outcomes focus has increased the challenge, and placed pressure on many traditional approaches to assessment. Portfolio assessment integrates with Project Based Learning (PBL) stratagems, and has improved student learning assessment in CQU engineering program PBL courses. A course is defined by three key components, which are linked to each other inextricably. The overarching component is the learning outcomes, which the student must demonstrate {{to succeed in the}} course. Linked to this is the content, which provides a vehicle for students to achieve the learning outcomes. The final component, and equally important, is assessment, which is the means by which the student demonstrates achievement of the learning outcomes. The linkage of Learning Outcomes and Assessment through content is of paramount importance to the success of any course and ultimately the entire program. The establishment of learning outcomes and the attendant content to enable their achievement is not difficult to achieve, however appropriate assessment is often very difficult to satisfactorily develop. Traditionally, formal examinations provided an assessment mechanism which yielded a quantifiable measure of the student’s performance. Students desire to determine “what will be on the exam” often clouds the learning process, resulting in a superficial learning that is quickly forgotten after the exam is over. Portfolio assessment thrusts the responsibility for the demonstration of the achievement onto students. Students are required to reflect on and ascertain what they need to demonstrate through the learning outcomes. Students are provided with a number of different opportunities for demonstrating the outcomes. These may include, amongst other things, formal <b>skills</b> <b>audits</b> (tests) which focus on specific core knowledge, but should include a need to delve significantly outside this to achieve higher grades. The challenging nature of the self discovery of knowledge and skills needed for that demonstration enhances the outcomes of the learning process for the student. Learning will tend to be broader, more integrated and more meaningful for the student...|$|R
