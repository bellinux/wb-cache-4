25|$|Every {{operation}} {{performed by}} a computer emits electromagnetic radiation and different operations emit radiation at different frequencies. In electromagnetic side-channel attacks, an attacker is only interested in a few frequencies at which encryption is occurring. Signal processing is responsible for isolating these frequencies from the vast multitude of extraneous radiation and noise. To isolate certain frequencies, a bandpass filter, which blocks frequencies outside of a given range, must {{be applied to the}} electromagnetic trace. Sometimes, the attacker does not know which frequencies encryption is performed at. In this case, the trace can be represented as a <b>spectrogram,</b> which can help determine which frequencies are most prevalent at different points of execution. Depending on the device being attacked and the level of noise, several filters may need to be applied.|$|E

40|$|National audienceMany {{audio signal}} {{processing}} algorithms {{rely on the}} estimation of magnitude or complex short-time Fourier transform (STFT) <b>spectrograms,</b> but usually do {{not take into account}} the necessity for the estimated <b>spectrograms</b> to be consistent, i. e., to correspond to the STFT of a real-valued time-domain signal. Consistency constraints were introduced in [1] and applied there to phase reconstruction from magnitude <b>spectrograms.</b> In this paper, we show how to use them to introduce penalty functions on the consistency of STFT <b>spectrograms</b> into the recently introduced complex non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) framework [2], which estimates recurring patterns in the observed magnitude spectra, their activations and their phases.

2500|$|FROG and {{autocorrelation}} {{share the}} idea of combining a pulse with itself in a nonlinear medium. [...] Since a nonlinear medium will only produce the desired signal when both pulses are present {{at the same time}} (i.e. “optical gating”), varying the delay between the pulse copies and measuring the signal at each delay gives a vague estimate of the pulse length. [...] Autocorrelators measure a pulse by measuring the intensity of the nonlinear signal field. [...] Estimating the pulse length requires assuming a pulse shape, and the phase of the pulse electric field cannot be measured at all. [...] FROG extends this idea by measuring the spectrum of the signal at each delay (hence “frequency-resolved”), instead of just the intensity. [...] This measurement creates a <b>spectrogram</b> of the pulse, which can be used to determine the complex electric field as a function of time or frequency as long as the nonlinearity of the medium is known.|$|E
2500|$|When the DFT is {{used for}} signal {{spectral}} analysis, the [...] sequence usually represents a finite set of uniformly spaced time-samples of some signal , where t represents time. [...] The conversion from continuous time to samples (discrete-time) changes the underlying Fourier transform of x(t) into a discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), which generally entails a type of distortion called aliasing. [...] Choice of an appropriate sample-rate (see Nyquist rate) {{is the key to}} minimizing that distortion. [...] Similarly, the conversion from a very long (or infinite) sequence to a manageable size entails a type of distortion called leakage, which is manifested as a loss of detail (a.k.a. resolution) in the DTFT. [...] Choice of an appropriate sub-sequence length is the primary key to minimizing that effect. [...] When the available data (and time to process it) is more than the amount needed to attain the desired frequency resolution, a standard technique is to perform multiple DFTs, for example to create a <b>spectrogram.</b> [...] If the desired result is a power spectrum and noise or randomness is present in the data, averaging the magnitude components of the multiple DFTs is a useful procedure to reduce the variance of the spectrum (also called a periodogram in this context); two examples of such techniques are the Welch method and the Bartlett method; the general subject of estimating the power spectrum of a noisy signal is called spectral estimation.|$|E
