Mike Leatherbee (Ph.D.(c) Stanford University) and Chuck Eesley (Stanford University Dept. of Management Science and Engineering) wrote Boulevard of broken behaviors: Cognitive and Behavioral effects of <b>Start-Up</b> <b>Chile.</b> They {{explored}} “socio-psychological mechanisms to stimulate entrepreneurial ecosystems” in public policies, taken as an example <b>Start-Up</b> <b>Chile.</b> “After a long time studying, we found {{that as a result of}} a forced social interaction between two socio-geographically distant groups (foreign and Chilean entrepreneurs), Chilean entrepreneurs significantly improved behaviors needed to discover innovative opportunities. Moreover, Chileans learned new strategies to undertake. In addition, they established valuable contacts with those foreigners, who after six months in Chile returned to the innovation poles from where they came. That is, the Chilean participants improved their behaviors, learn new strategies and built valuable social networks. In summary, increased its potential capacity” wrote Leatherbee at El Mercurio newspaper.|$|E

50|$|Retaining {{the best}} {{entrepreneurs}} and startups in Chile {{is always a}} challenge. SUP is considering ways to generate more incentives {{to stay in the}} country post program and provide a second phase of funding. “Creating the conditions to not only attract great talent, but also to encourage them to stay. This is our focus. Through greater access to capital funds we believe that this is possible”, says the Executive Director of SUP. That is why this year the program launched a follow on fund called <b>Start-Up</b> <b>Chile</b> SCALE, were Startups will receive up to 60 million Chilean pesos (around USD 100,000) to grow their businesses from Chile to the world.|$|E
50|$|Chile {{is full of}} entrepreneurs, {{but have}} always looked to build {{businesses}} at a local scale. However, after five years the program has shown that Chilean entrepreneurs are growing not only in numbers but are creating businesses at a global scale. “SUP transformed a group of science students from Universidad de Chile into global entrepreneurs and from a Chilean perspective that is extremely valuable. We entered with almost nothing to SUP and came out with an amazing MVP, users, a patent-pending technology. Six months after graduating from SUP, we got our second funding for 200K between a second CORFO funding and private investors” says Komal Dadlani, {{one of the founders}} of Lab4U, a mobile lab (<b>Start-UP</b> <b>Chile</b> generation 7th).

50|$|Today BASIC Initiative (www.basicinitiative.org and www.basicinitiative.com) is {{a service}} {{learning}} program which every year challenges students at various partner {{universities in the}} US, Latin America and Europe, and Asia to engage the problems of communities traditionally underserved by the design fields. Based on the pedagogical ideas of service learning and reflective practice, students have to date taken {{on the design of}} construction of more than 95 distinct projects in regions ranging from Southern India, Central Africa, Mexico and SE Asia to Native American communities in the US and Latin America. Among the multiple on-going public interest design programs that have emerged from this organization have been: The Design/Build Mexico Program; The American Indian Housing Initiative (AIHI in collaboration with Red Feather Development); Yaqui Single Mothers Housing Initiative (Hogar del Viento); The Ladakh Initiative (in collaboration with ARUP and the Druk White Lotus School); Katrina Furniture Project (KFP); and housing initiatives with teenage homelessness (OutsideIn, Portland, Oregon), Katrina Refugees (Houston with the Harpo Foundation, Mississippi with the Gulf Coast Community Design Center), and Latin America informal settlements with the governments of Argentina, Colombia, Haiti, Mexico and Uruguay).

40|$|Do {{business}} accelerators affect {{new venture}} performance? We {{investigate this question}} {{in the context of}} <b>Start-Up</b> <b>Chile,</b> an ecosystem accelerator. We focus on two treatment conditions typically found in business accelerators: basic services of funding and coworking space, and additional entrepreneurship schooling. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that schooling bundled with basic services can significantly increase new venture performance. In contrast, we find no evidence that basic services affect performance on their own. Our results are most relevant for ecosystem accelerators that attract young and early-stage businesses and suggest that entrepreneurial capital matters in new ventures...|$|E
40|$|Many {{billions of}} dollars each year are spent in pursuit of {{economic}} and social development goals. The field of program evaluation aims to measure the efficacy of these programs and allocate funds to achieve optimal results. However, current research on program design and evaluation tends to focus on determining causality through complex statistical methods, neglecting intermediate measures of data, such as network metrics. Similarly, research in computational social science has focused on generating hypotheses and validating theory rather than economic development applications. This thesis develops a novel technique for using computational social science to design and evaluate social and economic programs. A framework for program design and evaluation using network metrics is presented, along with two case studies that illustrate the use of this technique. In the first, we consider <b>Start-Up</b> <b>Chile,</b> an economic development program whose goal is to foster networks between Chileans and international entrepreneurs, using network metrics to evaluate its ability to facilitate connection between Chilean and non- Chilean entrepreneurs. Second, an agent-based model for designing entrepreneurial incubators is developed, with novel conclusions for more efficient design of economic development programs. </p...|$|E
