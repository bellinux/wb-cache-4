Although in vivo studies of senescence {{are in their}} infancy, evidence suggesting that <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> are a heterogeneous cell type is accumulating: senescence can be induced by different stressors, and <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> have varying degrees of genomic and epigenomic instability and different cell origins, contributing to their diversity. Two main classes of <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> have been identified: acute and chronic <b>senescent</b> <b>cells.</b> Acute <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> are generated during coordinated, beneficial biological processes characterized by a defined senescence trigger, transient senescent-cell signalling functions, and eventual senescent-cell clearance. In contrast, chronic <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> arise more slowly from cumulative, diverse stresses and are inefficiently eliminated, leading to their accumulation and deleterious effects through a secretory phenotype. <b>Senescent</b> <b>cells</b> {{have been identified in}} many tissues and organs, including the kidney.

A phagosome is {{formed by the}} fusion of the cell membrane around a microorganism or <b>senescent</b> <b>cell.</b> Phagosomes have membrane-bound proteins to recruit and fuse with lysosomes to form mature phagolysosomes. The lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) which kill and digest the pathogens. Phagosomes can also form in non-professional phagocytes, but they can only engulf a smaller range of particles, and do not contain ROS. The useful materials (e.g. amino acids) from the digested particles are moved into the cytosol, and waste is removed by exocytosis. Phagosome formation is crucial for tissue homeostasis and both innate and adaptive host defense against pathogens.|$|E

They found delayed <b>senescent</b> <b>cell</b> accumulation in mice with mutations that extend lifespan, {{as well as in}} mice that had their lifespan extended by food restriction. Later, Jan van Deursen and Darren Baker in collaboration with Andre Terzic at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., provided {{the first in}} vivo evidence for a causal link between cellular senescence and aging by preventing the accumulation of senescent cells in BubR1 progeroid mice. In the absence of senescent cells, the mice’s tissues showed a major improvement in the usual burden of age-related disorders. They did not develop cataracts, avoided the usual wasting of muscle with age. They retained the fat layers in the skin that usually thin out with age and, in people, cause wrinkling. Jan van Deursen, James Kirkland, Tamara Tchkonia, Nathan LeBrasseur, and Darren Baker at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., provided the first direct in vivo evidence that cellular senescence causes signs of aging by eliminating senescent cells from progeroid mice by introducing a drug-inducible suicide gene and then treating the mice with the drug to kill senescent cells selectively, as opposed to decreasing whole body p16. Another Mayo study led by James Kirkland in collaboration with Scripps and other groups demonstrated that senolytics, drugs that target senescent cells, enhance cardiac function and improve vascular reactivity in old mice, alleviate gait disturbance caused by radiation in mice, and delay frailty, neurological dysfunction, and osteoporosis in progeroid mice. Discovery of senolytic drugs was based on a hypothesis-driven approach: the investigators leveraged the observation that senescent cells are resistant to apoptosis to discover that pro-survival pathways are up-regulated in these cells. They demonstrated that these survival pathways are the [...] "Achilles heel" [...] of senescent cells using RNA interference approaches, including Bcl-2-, AKT-, p21-, and tyrosine kinase-related pathways. They then used drugs known to target the identified pathways and showed these drugs kill senescent cells by apoptosis in culture and decrease <b>senescent</b> <b>cell</b> burden in multiple tissues in vivo. Importantly, these drugs had long term effects after a single dose, consistent with removal of senescent cells, rather than a temporary effect requiring continued presence of the drugs. This was the first study to show that clearing senescent cells enhances function in chronologically aged mice.|$|E

Molecular analysis of <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> in tissue offers a special challenge {{since there are}} no cell surface markers for senescence which would let one use fluorescence-activated cell sorting as a method for separating out <b>senescent</b> <b>cells.</b> Methods We employed a novel laser capture microdissection (LCM) design to selectively harvest senescent and non-senescent annulus cells in paraffin-embedded tissue, and compared their gene expression with microarray analysis.

40|$|Cellular {{senescence}} is characterised by the irreversible {{arrest of}} proliferation, a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype and evasion of {{programmed cell death}} mechanisms. We report that senescence alters cellular iron acquisition and storage and also impedes iron-mediated <b>cell</b> death pathways. <b>Senescent</b> <b>cells,</b> regardless of stimuli (irradiation, replicative or oncogenic), accumulate vast amounts of intracellular iron (up to 30 -fold) with concomitant changes in the levels of iron homeostasis proteins. For instance, ferritin (iron storage) levels provided a robust biomarker of cellular senescence, for associated iron accumulation and for resistance to iron-induced toxicity. Cellular senescence preceded iron accumulation and was not perturbed by sustained iron chelation (deferiprone). Iron accumulation in <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> was driven by impaired ferritinophagy, a lysosomal process that promotes ferritin degradation and ferroptosis. Lysosomal dysfunction in <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> was confirmed through several markers, including the build-up of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC 3 -II) in autophagosomes. Impaired ferritin degradation explains the iron accumulation phenotype of <b>senescent</b> <b>cells,</b> whereby iron is effectively trapped in ferritin creating a perceived cellular deficiency. Accordingly, <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> were highly resistant to ferroptosis. Promoting ferritin degradation by using the autophagy activator rapamycin averted the iron accumulation phenotype of <b>senescent</b> <b>cells,</b> preventing the increase of TfR 1, ferritin and intracellular iron, but failed to re-sensitize these cells to ferroptosis.

Our data indicate that changes in band 3 structure during storage under blood bank conditions, as shown by immunoblot analysis, are not detectable as changes in expression of Diego antigens in intact cells. This makes it unlikely that immunological removal of erythrocytes after transfusion is mediated by reactions involving the Diego blood group system...|$|E
30|$|SA-β-gal {{activity}} was detected with a <b>senescent</b> <b>cell</b> staining kit (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) {{according to the}} manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the 40  mg/ml stock solution of 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) was prepared in the laboratory by dissolving the X-gal powder (Sigma Aldrich, USA) in N,N-dimethylformamide. Once prepared, it was stored at − 20  °C and used within a month, to ensure {{the accuracy of the}} assay.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cells {{that reach}} "Hayflick limit" of proliferation, known as <b>senescent</b> <b>cells,</b> possess a {{particular}} type of nuclear architecture. Human <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> are characterized by the presence of highly condensed senescent associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) that can be detected both by immunostaining for histone H 3 three-methylated at lysine 9 (H 3 K 9 me 3) and by DAPI counterstaining. METHODS: We have studied nuclear architecture in bovine <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> using a combination of immunofluorescence and 3 D fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: Analysis of heterochromatin distribution in bovine <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> using fluorescent in situ hybridization for pericentric chromosomal regions, immunostaining of H 3 K 9 me 3, centromeric proteins CENP A/B and DNA methylation showed a lower level of heterochromatin condensation as compared to young cells. No SAHF foci were observed. Instead, we observed fibrous ring-like or ribbon-like heterochromatin patterns that were undetectable with DAPI counterstaining. These heterochromatin fibers were associated with nucleoli. CONCLUSIONS: Constitutive heterochromatin in bovine <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> is organized in ring-like structures...|$|R
50|$|Although <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> can {{no longer}} replicate, they remain metabolically active and {{commonly}} adopt an immunogenic phenotype consisting of a pro-inflammatory secretome, the up-regulation of immune ligands, a pro-survival response, promiscuous gene expression (pGE) and stain positive for senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. The nucleus of <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> is characterized by senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) and DNA segments with chromatin alterations reinforcing senescence (DNA-SCARS). <b>Senescent</b> <b>cells</b> affect tumour suppression, wound healing and possibly embryonic/placental development and a pathological role in age-related diseases.|$|R
40|$|Senescent human diploid {{fibroblasts}} {{are unable}} to enter S phase in response to mitogenic stimulation. One of the key deficiencies in mitogen-stimulated <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> is their failure to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein, which acts as an inhibitor of entry into S phase in its unphosphorylated form. Recent data suggest that cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) regulated by G 1 cyclins (D type and E) {{are responsible for the}} primary phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein prior to the G 1 /S boundary. Surprisingly, we found 10 - to 15 -fold higher constitutive amounts of both cyclin E and cyclin D 1 in <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> compared to quiescent early-passage cells. Nevertheless, cyclin E-associated kinase activity in <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> was very low and did not increase significantly upon mitogenic stimulation even though cyclin E-Cdk 2 complexes were abundant. In contrast to early-passage cells in late G 1 phase, <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> contained mainly underphosphorylated cyclin E and proportionally more unphosphorylated and inactive Cdk 2, perhaps accounting for the low kinase activity. We also show {{that a majority of the}} Cdk 2 in <b>senescent</b> <b>cells,</b> but not in early-passage cells, was complexed with cyclin D 1. Cyclin D 1 -Cdk 2 complexes, severalfold enriched in <b>senescent</b> <b>cells,</b> contained exclusively unphosphorylated Cdk 2. Amounts of cyclin A, which ordinarily accumulates in S and G 2 phases, were extremely low in stimulated <b>senescent</b> <b>cells.</b> We suggest that the failure to activate cyclin E-Cdk 2 kinase activity in <b>senescent</b> <b>cells</b> may account for the inability of these cells to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein in late G 1 phase, which in turn may block the expression of late G 1 genes such as cyclin A that are required for entry into S phase...|$|R
