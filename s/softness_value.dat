As the virtual objects do {{not exist in the}} real world, we do not directly consider their physical properties but instead compute the human-perceived softness of the geometric shapes. We collect crowdsourced data where humans rank their perception of the softness of vertex pairs on virtual 3 D models. We then compute shape descriptors and use a learning to-rank approach to learn a softness measure mapping any vertex to a <b>softness</b> <b>value.</b> Finally, we demonstrate our framework with a variety of 3 D shapes...|$|E

To this end {{we have used a}} highly reliable optimization scheme at vanishing temperature while varying the wall separation over a representative range. Apart from the expected layered triangular and square structures (which are compatible with the three dimensional bulk fcc lattice), we {{have identified}} a cascade of highly complex intermediate structures. Taking benefit of the general scaling properties of inverse power potentials, we could identify [...] for a given <b>softness</b> <b>value</b> [...] one single master curve which relates the energy to the wall separation, irrespective of the density of the system.

The fully optimized complexes chloro(3 -thiapentane- 1, 5 -dithiolato) oxorhenium(V) and chloro(3 -thiapentane- 1, 5 -dithiolato) oxotechnetium(V) show geometries that compare favorably with the X-ray data. These structures were used {{as a starting point}} to investigate the relative stability of Tc(V) and Re(V) complexes with various ligands containing combinations of N, O, and S as chelating atoms and to evaluate the stabilizing/destabilizing influence of these N, O, and S combinations. For both Tc and Re complexes, the S content (number and position of S atoms) together with the presence of an oxygen as the central chelating atom turns out to be decisive in the stability of the tridentate complexes, the latter factor being strongly destabilizing and the former stabilizing. The stabilization sequences for both Tc and Re are shown to be identical in the gas phase and in aqueous solutions treated in a polarizable continuum model. The Re(V) complexes are found to be more stable than their Tc(V) analogues. All of the results are successfully interpreted in terms of the hard and soft acids and bases principle, applied at the local level. For this purpose, a <b>softness</b> <b>value</b> for Tc is obtained by interpolating softness trends in neighboring elements of rows 5 and 6 in the periodic table...|$|E

The energy parameter indicates BCPTI is a better electron donor than BTPTT in gas phase and the orbital parameter indicates BCPTI is also a better electron donor than BTPTT in liquid phase. In contrast to this, the energy parameter indicates BTPTT molecule has a better capability of accepting charge in gas phase and the orbital parameter indicates BTPTT molecule has also a better capability of accepting charge in liquid phase. The total electrophilicity indicates BCPTI is the strongest nucleophile in gas phase if energy parameter is applied and also is the strongest nucleophile in liquid phase if orbital parameter is applied. In contrast to this, BTPTT molecule is the strongest nucleophile in gas phase if orbital parameter is applied and also is the strongest nucleophile in liquid phase if energy parameter is applied.

Thermodynamic calculation demonstrated the stability of capecitabine and its modified derivatives (D 1 –D 4). Free energy and entropy estimation revealed relatively higher negative values, particularly for brominated and iodinated moieties (D 3 and D 4). The drug molecules were polar in nature confirmed by calculation of dipole moment. Frontier orbital calculations revealed increased hardness for the –CF 3 modified drug D 1 and increased softness for the iodinated drug D 4; moreover, <b>softness</b> <b>values</b> of the drugs, except fluorine, followed an increasing trend with the substitution of halogens of greater atomic radii. The –CF 3 modified ligand was found to possess the most negative binding energy value. Molecular docking, both flexible and rigid, exposed the free energies of binding for each ligand–TYMS interaction, when in each case the value obtained by rigid docking was found slightly more negative than that obtained by flexible docking.

30|$|The boat {{forms of}} {{donepezil}} and the modified derivatives {{were due to}} the change of conformations from chair to boat at the piperidine ring. Additional file 1 : Table S 1 describes the thermodynamic and electronic properties of the boat conformers Dʹ–Dʹ 5. Free energies of the boat molecules were slightly more negative compared to the chair counterparts. The dipole moments and <b>softness</b> <b>values</b> for the boat conformers had larger values than the corresponding chair conformers. For instance, dipole moment and <b>softness</b> <b>values</b> of the boat conformer of donepezil were 3.57 and 12.16 D respectively which are almost 1.0 and 0.40 D units larger than that of chair donepezil. The pattern of the changes of the electrical and thermodynamic parameters for the Dʹ–Dʹ 5 were identical to the D–D 5 counterparts, which was demonstrated by the increasing dipole moment and softness up to Dʹ 4 and a decrease for –CF 3 modified Dʹ 5. The most notable part regarding the boat conformers was that binding affinity {{for each of the}} molecules was 0.2 ‒ 1.0 Kcalmol− 1 more negative compared to the counterpart chair conformers. The most favorable boat ligands according to molecular docking were fluorinated and –CF 3 modified Dʹ 1 and Dʹ 5 forms with binding energies being − 12.6 and − 12.5 Kcalmol− 1 respectively. Comparison among the energy values has been shown in Table  3. Such binding affinity, however, was in less concordance when correlated with the non-covalent interactions found for (Dʹ–Dʹ 5)-AChE complexes. According to the binding site analysis, Donepezil at the boat conformer was found to form a few hydrophobic contacts and C‒H…O bonding with Trp 279, Arg 289 and His 440. The latter two amino acids were not involved at the contact sites involving any of the chair conformers and His 440 is one of the three amino acids of the catalytic-triad. Analysis of Dʹ 1, on the other hand, saw the formation of pi‒stacking interactions with Trp 84, Tyr 334 and Gly 335. The C‒H…pi bond distance at Tyr 334 was found to be 2.70 Å. Ligand Dʹ 5, on the other hand, showed stacking interactions with Trp 84, Phe 330, Phe 331 and Tyr 334; moreover, the F atoms formed a number of H‒bonds with Trp 84 and Gly 118. Details {{about the nature of the}} contact sites for the boat conformers Dʹ, Dʹ 1 and Dʹ 5 against AChE are given in Additional file 1 : Figure S 3. Dʹ 2 –Dʹ 4 showed some identical binding sites to that of their chair counterparts- stacking interactions with Trp 279, Phe 330 and Tyr 334 for example. In addition to that, some hydrophobic contacts and H‒bonding at Trp 8, Tyr 121 and Asp 285 were observed.|$|R

In this study, the selectivity of the methylation mechanism was analyzed computationally on the 2 '-OCbz- 3 '-NMeCbz derivative of azithromycin in vacuum and in DMF. We {{have shown that the}} methylation of the hydroxy group on C- 6 is energetically unfavorable compared to the other hydroxy groups in vacuum; the <b>softness</b> <b>values</b> further showed that the C- 6 anion is not reactive towards CH 3 I in the methylation mechanism. To understand the effect of the solvent on the methylation process, detailed molecular dynamics simulations were performed in DMF using the anions at the C- 4 ", C- 6, C- 11 and C- 12 positions. We find the conformations of the anions not to be affected by the presence of the solvent. The radial distribution functions of the solvent molecules around the O- of the anions demonstrate that DMF molecules cluster around the C- 6 anion. The relative strength of the anion-solvent interactions reveal that the solvent molecules provide the largest stabilization to the C- 6 anion and prevent the methylation at this position. The latter descriptor was found to be an important factor in explaining the experimentally observed selectivity towards the methylation of the C- 4 ", C- 6, C- 11 and C- 12 anions...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen bonding {{is among}} the most {{fundamental}} interactions in biology and chemistry, providing an extra stabilization of 1 - 40 kcal/mol to the molecular systems involved. This wide range of stabilization energy underlines the need for a general and comprehensive theory that will explain the formation of hydrogen bonds. While a simple electrostatic model is adequate to describe the bonding patterns in the weak and moderate hydrogen bond regimes, strong hydrogen bonds, on the other hand, require a more complete theory due to the appearance of covalent interactions. In this study, conceptual DFT tools such as local hardness, () and local softness, s(), have been used in order to get an alternative view on solving this hydrogen-bonding puzzle as described by Gilli et al. [J. Mol. Struct. 2000, 552, 1]. A series of both homonuclear and heteronuclear resonance-assisted hydrogen bonds of the types O-H···N, N-H···O, N-H···N, and O-H···O with strength varying from weak to very strong have been studied. First of all, PA and pKa values were calculated and correlated to the hydrogen bond energy. Then the electrostatic effects were examined as hard-hard interactions accessible through molecular electrostatic potential, natural population analysis (NPA) charge, and local hardness calculations. Finally, secondary soft-soft interaction effects were entered into the picture described by the local <b>softness</b> <b>values,</b> providing insight into the covalent character of the strong hydrogen bonds...|$|R

40|$|Past sensory {{experience}} can influence present perception. We studied {{the effect of}} adaptation in haptic softness perception. Participants compared two silicon rubber stimuli, a reference and a comparison stimulus, by indenting them simultaneously with the index fingers of their two hands and decided which one felt softer. In adaptation conditions the index finger that explored the reference stimulus had previously been adapted to another rubber stimulus. The adaptation stimulus was indented 5 times with a force of > 15 N, thus the two in-dex fingers had a different sensory past. In baseline conditions there was no previous adaptation. We measured the Points of Subjective Equality (PSEs) of one reference stimulus {{to a set of}} comparison stimuli. We used four different adaptation stimuli, one was harder, two were softer and one had approximately the same compliance as compared to the reference stimulus. PSEs shifted {{as a function of the}} compliance of the adaptation stimulus: the reference was per-ceived to be softer when the finger had been adapted to a harder stimulus and it was perceived to be harder after adaptation to a softer stimulus. We conclude that recent sensory experience causes a shift of haptically perceived softness away from the softness of the adaptation stimulus. The finding that perceived softness is susceptible to adaptation suggests that there might be neural chan-nels tuned to different <b>softness</b> <b>values</b> and <b>softness</b> is an independent primary perceptual quality.

40|$|At present, {{a plethora}} of {{techniques}} is available to study molecular systems and chemical reactions. In this light, ab initio many body techniques enable us, without any experimental input, to compute molecular energetics and {{a whole range of}} chemical properties. A twofold classification can be made, separating wave function based methods (such as Hartree-Fock) from density functional theory (DFT). In this thesis, the focus mainly lies on the density functional method, both from a conceptual as computational viewpoint - for the latter, one of the reasons being its excellent cost-to-performance ratio. The formulation of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems in 1964 provided the starting point for the fast development of fundamental DFT, yielding all basic ingredients for a complete many-body theory. In a next step, Kohn and Sham introduced orbitals within the formalism, paving the way to a breakthrough of DFT as an important computational tool within modern chemistry. In addition to these developments, much {{attention has been paid to}} the insights DFT can give into chemical reactivity. In particular, the density functional methodology provides an excellent framework to define a variety of well-known chemical concepts. In this thesis, the applicability of several fundamental DFT-based reactivity indicators has been tested for a variety of reactions occurring in diverse domains of chemistry. The chemical potential, global hardness and global softness are used to discuss the reactive behavior of one single molecule or a set of related molecules, providing reactivity sequences for the latter. The Fukui function is used as an intra-molecular descriptor, whereas the local softness can provide inter-molecular reactivity information about regio selectivity. In order to test the usefulness of the aforementioned properties, they are usually used in conjunction with well-known chemical principles such as the electronegativity equalization, the principle of maximum hardness and the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) principle. A validation of the results is obtained through comparison with ab initio thermodynamic and kinetic data. In general, DFT-based concepts have proven to be of great use in the interpretation of a variety of experimental and theoretical results. It remains nevertheless challenging to make predictions about their success or failure for specific types of interactions. In order to rely on the indicators as independent and/or predictive tools for the description of chemical reactivity, there is need for practical guidelines describing which indicators are suitable for a certain problem. The descriptors probe electronic interactions, however it is clear that they do not monitor other effects, such as steric contributions. Whenever the indicators are tested, their limitations must a priori be kept in mind. For instance, some of the reactions studied in this work exhibit high reaction barriers due to large steric hindrance effects between the two reactants and thus, the indicators are not expected to be successful. The largest group of applications concerns radical reactions. The majority of them occur during the formation of coke, which is a side process of thermal cracking of hydrocarbons. Radical systems are particularly interesting and challenging. However so far only a handful of papers examined and discussed their behavior using reactivity descriptors. In the specific case of hydrogen abstraction reactions at polyaromatic species by a methyl radical, accurate, reliable and yet affordable thermodynamic and kinetic data have been obtained. Other studied bimolecular radical reactions are addition reactions of radicals to small olefins and the initiation and first propagation steps within the polymerization process of polyethylene and poly(vinylchloride). Overall, it can be concluded that the radical Fukui function is capable of indicating the preferred site of reaction. This clearly indicates the importance of frontier orbital effects for this specific type of interaction. The local HSAB principle was also successfully applied, leading to correct reactivity sequences when related molecules were compared with each other. Hence the local softness is a suitable indicator for studying bimolecular radical reactions. This is in accordance with earlier suggestions and with the categorization of Klopman, as the larger radicals are characterized by high global <b>softness</b> <b>values.</b> Whereas the local viewpoint leads to satisfactory results, the global HSAB principle fails for some specific bimolecular radical reactions and is therefore not recommended. In addition to these bimolecular reactions, two examples of unimolecular radical cyclization reactions have also been studied. For these reactions, the Fukui function is used to describe the intra-molecular regio selectivity. However, the correct site of cyclization could not be indicated. Since these reactions correspond to a constrained charge transfer - the spin number remains constant, whereas the total number of electrons changes at a local level - the spin-polarized reactivity descriptors, and in particular the spin-polarized Fukui function has been tested and indeed, its usefulness is demonstrated. A second group of studied bimolecular reactions correspond to typical reactions occurring within zeolite catalysis. The small probe molecules are characterized as hard systems, and both polar and apolar representatives were chosen. The zeolite catalyst was modelled by a small 5 -tetrahedral cluster, and in addition to the traditional oxygen-bridged cluster the influence of amine substitution was tested. These reactions were difficult to describe using DFT-based reactivity descriptors. The global HSAB principle fails for the interactions with the polar molecules, as in these cases polarization effects - which are not included in the purely electron transfer process - are dominant. In contrast, the reactions between the zeolite clusters and the apolar molecules do follow the HSAB rule. From a local point of view, the complex mechanism of these concerted reactions, occurring simultaneously at the acid and basic site of the zeolite framework, could not be specified based on local descriptors. Multiple-site interactions in general remain a domain for further research. In addition, the local hardness might be more suitable to describe interactions with hard molecules, although at present the calculations remain troublesome and no practical scheme is presented yet. A final application concerns a unimolecular ionic cyclization reaction leading to the formation of a four-membered beta-lactam ring. This is an example in which competing pathways can take place because the formation of the more stable six-membered ring, instead of the strained four-membered ring, is initially expected. The anion reactant is a very soft species and the traditional local indicator, i. e. the Fukui function, succeeds in correctly predicting the preferred reaction path. Therefore the indicator adds to the unravelling of the origin of the experimentally observed cyclization preference. Moreover, extension to bimolecular reactions using this anion reactant also revealed the successful applicability of the local softness, as also these results were in correspondence with reaction barriers obtained at 0 Kelvin. In this thesis, one of the main advantages of using reactivity descriptors was accentuated, in particular their low computational cost. Not only do they solely require information from the reactants, but it was furthermore demonstrated that reactivity sequences are mainly independent of the level of theory used for geometry optimizations as well as for single-point energy calculations. An extended set of theoretical procedures, ranging from simple ab initio methods such as Hartree-Fock, over a very popular and successful functional, to the latest class of highly promising methods. The observation of level-of-theory independency for the calculation of the global descriptors is highly reassuring and adds to the reliability of DFT-based reactivity indicators. It must however be emphasized that overall the perturbative approach should be used complementary to information obtained from thermodynamics and kinetics...|$|R
