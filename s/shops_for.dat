5|$|By July 1789, revolutionary {{sentiment}} {{was rising}} in Paris. The Estates-General was convened in May {{and members of}} the Third Estate proclaimed the Tennis Court Oath in June, calling for the king to grant a written constitution. Violence between loyal royal forces, mutinous members of the royal Gardes Françaises and local crowds broke out at Vendôme on 12 July, leading to widespread fighting and the withdrawal of royal forces from the centre of Paris. Revolutionary crowds began to arm themselves during 13 July, looting royal stores, gunsmiths and armourers' <b>shops</b> <b>for</b> weapons and gunpowder.|$|E

40|$|A {{steady stream}} of {{research}} {{over the past few}} decades has focused on store and shopping mall patronage and consumers’ associated enjoyment of the shopping experience. Based on previous research, the sources of shopping enjoyment were identified as shopping to socialize, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> bargains, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> gratification, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> entertainment, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> others, <b>shopping</b> to browse, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> exercise and <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> sensory stimulation. The objective of this study was to investigate gender differences in the sources of shopping enjoyment. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires distributed at a large metropolitan shopping centre in the eastern suburbs of Pretoria. The findings indicate significant gender differences on all the sources of shopping enjoyment except ‘shopping for entertainment’. This study contributes to the current literature and provides valuable information to South African retailers, specifically with regard to marketing and promotional strategies aimed at male and female shoppers separately. Suggestions for future research are offered. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|The Trocadero sits in {{the area}} between Coventry Street, Great Windmill Street and Shaftesbury Avenue, with the main {{entrance}} on Coventry Street. The origins of the site {{can be traced back}} to 1744, when John Cartwright gave a 99-year lease on this land to Thomas Higginson, in order to construct a real tennis court. Higginson retained ownership of the court until 1761, after which it had a number of owners through to the 19th century. From the 1820s onwards, it was used as a music and exhibition hall. After the lease expired in 1842, ownership passed to John Musgrove, who sublet it to Robert Bignel. Bignel redesigned the premises as a number of assembly rooms called the Argyll Rooms. It acquired a notorious reputation for prostitution, and consequently closed in 1878. It re-opened four years later as the Trocadero Palace, a music hall. A group of shops were established on the site in 1889, and the entire development was sold to J. Lyon's & Co in 1895. Having been part of the Lyons restaurant complex and <b>shops</b> <b>for</b> much of the 20th century, it is now a shopping centre.|$|E
