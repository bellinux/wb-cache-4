5000|$|Mister Rogers went onstage {{to accept}} the award—and there, {{in front of all}} the soap opera stars and talk show sinceratrons, in front of all the jutting man-tanned jaws and jutting {{saltwater}} bosoms, he made his small bow and <b>said</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> [...] "All of us have special ones who have loved us into being. Would you just take, along with me, ten seconds to think {{of the people who have}} helped you become who you are. Ten seconds of silence."And then he lifted his wrist, looked at the audience, looked at his watch, and said, [...] "I'll watch the time." [...] There was, at first, a small whoop from the crowd, a giddy, strangled hiccup of laughter, as people realized that he wasn't kidding, that Mister Rogers was not some convenient eunuch, but rather a man, an authority figure who actually expected them to do what he asked. And so they did. One second, two seconds, three seconds—and now the jaws clenched, and the bosoms heaved, and the mascara ran, and the tears fell upon the beglittered gathering like rain leaking down a crystal chandelier. And Mister Rogers finally looked up from his watch and said softly [...] "May God be with you," [...] to all his vanquished children.|$|E
5000|$|The first track {{recorded}} {{was the old}} blues standard, [...] "Tin Pan Alley", {{which was}} done in one take. Hammond <b>said</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> talkback <b>microphone,</b> [...] "That's <b>the</b> best you'll ever get that song. That sounded wonderful." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> {{when playing}} as Chanel, the Cheetah with “pipes” ...|$|R
5000|$|Studio {{monitoring}} headphones (typicallly closed-shell, {{to prevent}} sound from [...] "leaking" [...] out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphones)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|In fact, {{one of the}} judges, Madame Rosa Alberghotti, a {{well-known}} opera singer, was dead set against awarding the title to Margaret because she had screamed an expletive <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone.</b> Mrs. McClay yelled at her to shut up. She further states that Margaret hadn't screamed <b>the</b> word <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> although her claims were easily disproven because the offending word was heard by the whole audience.|$|R
5000|$|... "His deep {{commitment}} to the music is always evident in his playing, as is his humor. In concert, he will occasionally put down his saxophone and simply make vocal sounds <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> <b>the</b> effect of which is often both humorous and musical." ...|$|R
5|$|Robert Ashley used audio {{feedback}} in his avant-garde piece The Wolfman (1964) {{by setting up}} a howl between <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> and loudspeaker and then singing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> in way that modulated the feedback with his voice.|$|R
50|$|The LaserScope {{received}} negative {{reviews for}} its poor microphone technology; users complained that saying anything <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> would cause <b>the</b> LaserScope to fire, including background noise.|$|R
5000|$|Obnoxious Microphone Guy, a very {{annoying}} man {{who attends}} parties and other events, will {{at some point}} steal <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> from <b>the</b> emcee (usually played by Jason Sudeikis) and obnoxiously scream [...] "WHAAAAAAAAAT!" [...] <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> before dropping it on the floor.|$|R
25|$|Most amateur digital modes are {{transmitted}} by inserting audio <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> input {{of a radio}} and using an analog scheme, such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or single-sideband modulation (SSB).|$|R
5000|$|In 1968 Opałka {{introduced}} to the process a tape recorder, speaking each number <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> as he painted it, and also began taking passport-style photographs of himself standing before the canvas after each day's work.|$|R
5000|$|Voice Calculation, {{which is}} similar to the Calculations puzzles. However, this puzzle {{requires}} the player to speak <b>the</b> correct answer <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> instead of write it on the touch screen, similar to the Stroop Test.|$|R
2500|$|The hosts end each episode {{with their}} catch phrase, [...] "Stay sexy and don't get murdered." [...] Hardstark then asks her cat [...] "Elvis, want a cookie?", and Elvis meows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> and <b>the</b> episode ends.|$|R
50|$|The sending {{loudness}} rating (SLR) {{is a measure}} of the loudness of the transmit audio sent through <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> of a communication device (for example, a mobile phone) It compares the Sound intensity of <b>the</b> sound waves <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> to <b>the</b> resulting audio signal. It is measured in dBV/Pa.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Principal Lewis {{appoints}} Steve to {{a position}} as a public announcer at Pearl Bailey High School, after Steve tricks <b>the</b> previous announcer <b>into</b> shouting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> whatever he says {{goes on in the}} school, claiming people always forget <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> is still on. Steve himself develops such a God complex (or as Principal Lewis calls it, [...] "getting drunk on the mike"), prompting his concerned friends to use <b>the</b> same <b>microphone</b> trick on him. Snot takes over the announcer position and abuses its power as well, and Barry swears directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> leading to Lewis kicking the entire group out of his office room. Principal Lewis, however, gets in trouble when he forgets <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> is on while vocally reminiscing about his shady days as a cocaine trafficker in Peru (first mentioned in [...] "Iced, Iced Babies").|$|R
40|$|Length: 4 : 40 min The speaker {{had told}} KH that she {{once had a}} very special dog. KH has {{prompted}} her to speak about that dog in Movima. This {{is the second time}} the speaker tells a story <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> (<b>the</b> first was "Loro"). Only the speaker and KH are present. The voices in the background come from the bar next door...|$|R
50|$|The single edit {{also had}} a {{slightly}} different mix of Miller's lead vocal on the song. On the album version, one can often hear Miller breathing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> as he begins singing a line. His breathing was mixed out of the single release.|$|R
50|$|In Monster Rancher DS and Monster Rancher DS 2, {{the system}} is revised to take {{advantage}} of the Nintendo DS's input devices. Monsters can be generated by speaking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> drawing figures on the bottom screen, or inserting a Game Boy Advance game cartridge <b>into</b> <b>the</b> second slot.|$|R
5000|$|Night of the Living Dead Boys is a 1981 live album by The Dead Boys. It was {{recorded}} in March 1979 at CBGB. Since Stiv Bators purposely did not sing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> at this show, the vocals were overdubbed later, causing mixed opinions on this album.|$|R
60|$|They {{began to}} breathe more easily. The {{invisible}} pilot had taken control smoothly, calmly. The ship {{was in good}} hands. Kramer spoke a few more words <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> and they swung again. Now they were moving back {{the way they had}} come, toward the moon.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the player}} {{confirms}} {{whether or not}} he or she can speak <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> Professor Kawashima will describe the first puzzle. If the player answered that they can speak, the game begins with a Stroop test; if the player cannot use <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> <b>the</b> game picks a random puzzle from the following: Calculations X 20, Word Memory, Connect Maze, Number Cruncher, and Speed Counting.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{challenge}} with doing live sound {{for individuals who}} are speaking at a conference is that, in comparison with professional singers, individuals who are invited to speak at a forum may not be familiar with how microphones work. Some individuals may accidentally point <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> towards a speaker or monitor speaker, which may cause audio feedback [...] "howls". In some cases, when an individual who is speaking does not speak enough directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> <b>the</b> audio engineer may ask the individual to wear a lavaliere microphone, which can be clipped onto a lapel.|$|R
50|$|It was {{approximately}} {{the size and}} shape of a standard American shoebox. It had a display of ten small lamp lights labeled with the digits 0 through 9 and an attached <b>microphone.</b> Speaking <b>the</b> name of <b>the</b> digit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> would cause <b>the</b> appropriate digit lamp to light.|$|R
5000|$|Wendigo {{appears as}} an early boss in the video game X2: Wolverine's Revenge voiced by Frank Welker. Among the game's unlockable cut scenes is a humorous out-of-continuity moment {{involving}} the Wendigo entering a recording studio (and having trouble due to its size) and delivering its sole line ("WEN-DI-GO!") <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the {{recording}} sessions, bass player Darryl Jones introduced Sting to his longtime idol Miles Davis. Sting was startled when Davis {{asked him if}} he could speak French, and since he did, Miles asked him to translate <b>the</b> Miranda warning <b>into</b> French and yell it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> against a backing track.|$|R
50|$|In Game 4 of the 2004 World Series, Villamán got {{so excited}} when pitcher Keith Foulke {{threw the ball}} to first base, sealing the Red Sox's 86-year curse-ending victory, that his voice cracked during the broadcast. ¡Boston gana! (Boston wins!) he screamed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> seven times, so loudly his voice became raspy.|$|R
50|$|The {{tracking}} {{of the parts}} was unorthodox in many ways ranging from drums recorded in alleyways on cassette tape recorders and then reprocessed through outboard gear to vocals being sung while moving round the room and brass performed by members of Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra directed to not play directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphones.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>microphones</b> detect pitch using {{digital signal}} processing, which {{analyses}} {{the frequency of}} the incoming signal via Fast Fourier transform. The frequency is then compared to stored information to evaluate if the note is correct. Regular singing segments do not feature speech recognition, and so humming <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> at <b>the</b> correct pitch will also score points. Rap sections use a combination of speech recognition and rhythm detection.|$|R
5000|$|... "Two {{turntables}} and a microphone" [...] is {{the basic}} concept of a DJ's equipment. This phrase describes turntables (phonographs) and a microphone connected to a mixer. The DJ uses the mixer's crossfader to fade between two songs playing on the turntables. Fading often includes beatmatching. Live hip hop music also often has an MC rapping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone.</b> In nightclubs <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> is usually used only for announcements.|$|R

50|$|Captions {{are created}} by a {{communications}} assistant using a computer with voice recognition software. The communications assistant listens to and revoices the hearing party's side of <b>the</b> conversation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> of a headset. A voice recognition program creates the captions and they are sent out to the captioned telephone where they are read by the user.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} {{directed}} by Hype Williams begins with Amel Larrieux and Bryce Wilson in a recording studio. Amel is singing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> whilst Bryce is producing behind the studio panel. In other scenes, Amel bops in front a city skyline. In between scenes are transitional shots, which feature either {{the face of}} Amel singing or Bryce nodding.|$|R
5000|$|It {{follows the}} {{attempts}} {{of a young}} male protagonist to impress a young woman, aided {{by a group of}} people known as the [...] "Rub Rabbits" [...] into completing a series of minigames related to the plot. These minigames are all controlled by the touch screen and microphone, and often involve tapping, scribbling, and blowing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone.</b>|$|R
500|$|Around this time, I {{would say}} {{something}} into a microphone onstage, and afterward [...] pull me aside and say, [...] "Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again." [...] He would misconstrue me talking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't {{have to be so}} fucking afraid anymore.|$|R
2500|$|From the {{perspective}} of the transmitter, the sound amounts to little more than somebody whistling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone.</b> However, <b>the</b> software rapidly shifts the phase of the audio signal between two states (hence the name [...] "phase-shift keying"), forming the character codes. These phase shifts serve the same function as the two tones used in traditional RTTY and similar systems.|$|R
