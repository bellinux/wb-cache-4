40|$|Observed and {{projected}} climatic changes demand for robust assessments of climate impacts on various environmental and anthropogenic systems. Empirical-statistical downscaling (ESD) methods coupled to output from climate model projections are promising tools to assess impacts at regional to local scale. ESD methods correct for common model deficiencies in accuracy (e. g. model biases) and scale (e. g. grid vs point scale). However, most ESD methods require long observational time series {{at the target}} sites, and this often restricts robust impact assessments to {{a small number of}} sites. This paper presents a method to generate robust climate model based scenarios for target sites with short and (or) sparse observational data coverage. The approach is based on the well-established quantile mapping method and incorporates two major steps: (1) climate model bias correction to the most representative station with long-term measurements and (2) spatial transfer of bias-corrected model data to represent target site characteristics. Both steps are carried out using the quantile mapping technique. The resulting output can serve as end user–tailored input for climate impact models. The method allows for multivariate and multi-model ensemble scenarios and additionally enables to approximately reconstruct data for non-measured periods. The method's applicability is validated using (1) long-term weather stations across the topographically and climatologically complex territory of Switzerland and (2) sparse data sets from Swiss permafrost research sites located in challenging conditions at high altitudes. It is shown that the two-step approach performs well and offers attractive quality, even for extreme target locations. Uncertainties, however, remain and primarily depend on (1) data availability and (2) the considered variable. The two-step approach itself involves large uncertainties when applied to <b>short</b> <b>reference</b> data <b>sets</b> or spatially heterogeneous variables (e. g. precipitation, wind speed). For temperature, results are promising even when using very short calibration periods...|$|R
40|$|Classification {{of objects}} is an {{important}} area {{in a variety of}} fields and applications. Many different methods are available to make a decision in those cases. The k-nearest neighbor rule (k-NN) is a well-known nonparametric decision procedure. Classification rules based on the k-NN have already been proposed and applied in diverse substantive areas. The editing k-NN proposed by Wilson would be an important one. In this rule, editing the <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> is first performed, every sample in the <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> is classified by using the k-NN rule and the set is formed by eliminating it from the <b>reference</b> <b>set.</b> All the samples mistakenly classified are then deleted from the <b>reference</b> <b>set.</b> Afterward, any input sample is classified using the k-NN rule and the edited <b>reference</b> <b>set.</b> Obviously, the editing k-nearest neighbors classifier (EK -NN) consists of the k-nearest neighbor classifier and an editing <b>reference</b> <b>set.</b> However, the editing <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> gained by this method is only a subset of the <b>reference</b> <b>set.</b> This may result in the loss of some important information and decline of classification accuracy. In this paper, we focus on modifying the editing <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> of EK -NN, the new editing set in our method consists of subsets of the <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> and testing set, such subsets are received by classifying every sample in the <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> and testing set by using the k-NN rule and removing misclassified samples from <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> and testing set, respectively. Advantages of our method are to reduce the loss of information and improve the recognition rate. Comparisons and analysis of the experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed algorithm...|$|R

Each ensemble member is given {{a subset of the}} training data. Using Wilson’s editing method, the ensemble member produces a reduced <b>reference</b> <b>set.</b> We explored several routes to make use of these <b>reference</b> <b>sets.</b> The results with 10 real and artificial data sets indicated that merging the <b>reference</b> <b>sets</b> and subsequent editing of the merged set provides the best trade-off between the error {{and the size of the}} resultant <b>reference</b> <b>set.</b> This approach can also handle large data sets because only small fractions of the data are edited at a time. ...|$|R

" Despite their inconsistent structure and lack of grammar, posts are full of useful information. This paper presents work on semi-automatically building tables of relational information, called "reference sets," by analyzing such posts directly. <b>Reference</b> <b>sets</b> {{can be applied to}} a number of tasks such as ontology maintenance and information extraction. Our reference-set construction method starts with just a small amount of background knowledge, and constructs tuples representing the entities in the posts to form a <b>reference</b> <b>set.</b> We also describe an extension to this approach for the special case where even this small amount of background knowledge is impossible to discover and use. To evaluate the utility of the machine-constructed <b>reference</b> <b>sets,</b> we compare them to manually constructed <b>reference</b> <b>sets</b> in the context of reference-set-based information extraction. Our results show the <b>reference</b> <b>sets</b> constructed by our method outperform manually constructed <b>reference</b> <b>sets.</b> We also compare the reference-set-based extraction approach using the machine-constructed <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> to supervised extraction approaches using generic features.

40|$|Previous work on {{information}} extraction from unstructured, ungrammatical text (e. g. classified ads) showed that exploiting {{a set of}} background knowledge, called a “reference set, ” greatly improves the precision and recall of the extractions. However, finding a source for this <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> is often difficult, if not impossible. Further, even if a source is found, it might not overlap well with the text for extraction. In this paper we present an approach to building the <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> directly from the text itself. Our approach eliminates the need to find the source for the <b>reference</b> <b>set,</b> and ensures better overlap between the text and <b>reference</b> <b>set.</b> Starting {{with a small amount}} of background knowledge, our technique constructs tuples representing the entities in the text to form a <b>reference</b> <b>set.</b> Our results show that our method outperforms manually constructed <b>reference</b> <b>sets,</b> since hand built <b>reference</b> <b>sets</b> may not overlap with the entities in the unstructured, ungrammatical text.

40|$|Abstract Background A widely-used {{approach}} for discovering functional and physical interactions among proteins involves phylogenetic profile comparisons (PPCs). Here, proteins with similar profiles are inferred to be functionally related {{under the assumption}} that proteins involved in the same metabolic pathway or cellular system are likely to have been co-inherited during evolution. Results Our experimentation with E. coli and yeast proteins with 16 different carefully composed <b>reference</b> <b>sets</b> of genomes revealed that the phyletic patterns of proteins in prokaryotes alone could be adequate enough to make reasonably accurate functional linkage predictions. A slight improvement in performance is observed on adding few eukaryotes into the <b>reference</b> <b>set,</b> but a noticeable drop-off in performance is observed with increased number of eukaryotes. Inclusion of most parasitic, pathogenic or vertebrate genomes and multiple strains of the same species into the <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> do not necessarily contribute to an improved sensitivity or accuracy. Interestingly, we also found that evolutionary histories of individual pathways have a significant affect on the performance of the PPC approach with respect to a particular <b>reference</b> <b>set.</b> For example, to accurately predict functional links in carbohydrate or lipid metabolism, a <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> solely composed of prokaryotic (or bacterial) genomes performed among the best compared to one composed of genomes from all three super-kingdoms; this is in contrast to predicting functional links in translation for which a <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> composed of prokaryotic (or bacterial) genomes performed the worst. We also demonstrate that the widely used random null model to quantify the statistical significance of profile similarity is incomplete, which could result in an increased number of false-positives. Conclusion Contrary to previous proposals, it is not merely the number of genomes but a careful selection of informative genomes in the <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> that influences the prediction accuracy of the PPC approach. We note that the predictive power of the PPC approach, especially in eukaryotes, is heavily influenced by the primary endosymbiosis and subsequent bacterial contributions. The over-representation of parasitic unicellular eukaryotes and vertebrates additionally make eukaryotes less useful in the <b>reference</b> <b>sets.</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>sets</b> composed of highly non-redundant set of genomes from all three super-kingdoms fare better with pathways showing considerable vertical inheritance and strong conservation (e. g. translation apparatus), while <b>reference</b> <b>sets</b> solely composed of prokaryotic genomes fare better for more variable pathways like carbohydrate metabolism. Differential performance of the PPC approach on various pathways, and a weak positive correlation between functional and profile similarities suggest that caution should be exercised while interpreting functional linkages inferred from genome-wide large-scale profile comparisons using a single <b>reference</b> <b>set.</b> </p...|$|R

Tracking subset {{relations}} between the contents containers on the heap is fundamental to modeling the semantics of many common programing idioms such as applying a function to a subset of objects and maintaining multiple views of {{the same set of}} objects. We introduce a relation, must <b>reference</b> <b>sets,</b> which subsumes the concept of must-aliasing and enables existing shape analysis techniques to efficiently and accurately model many types of containment properties without the use of explicit quantification or specialized logics for containers/sets. We extend an existing shape analysis to model the concept of <b>reference</b> <b>sets.</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>sets</b> allow the analysis to efficiently track a number of important relations (must-=, and must-⊆) between objects that are the targets of <b>sets</b> of <b>references</b> (variables or pointers). We show that shape analysis augmented with <b>reference</b> <b>set</b> information is able to precisely model sharing for a range of data structures in real programs that cannot be expressed using simple must-alias information. In contrast to more expressive proposals based on logic languages (e. g., extensions of first-order predicate logic with transitive closure or the use of a decision procedure for <b>sets),</b> <b>reference</b> <b>sets</b> can be efficiently tracked in a shape analyzer. ...|$|R
