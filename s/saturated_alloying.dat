40|$|When {{a liquid}} SiMn alloy is cooled, carbon is {{dissolved}} from the melt. The dissolved carbon either forms graphite or reacts with silicon from the melt to form SiC. The {{goal of this}} thesis has been to determine how temperature fluctuations affect the formation of SiC and graphite in the SiMn process. The focus of this thesis has been on dissolved carbon from the SiMn alloy due to cooling of the system, {{and the formation of}} graphite and SiC from this dissolution of carbon. The experiments conducted in this thesis is done with near constant silicon content, and temperature as the main variable in addition to carbon. The investigation was carried out by heating SiMn alloys several times, forming SiC and graphite. Carbon from the crucibles dissolved into the liquid SiMn alloy to reach equilibrium between carbon and silicon. This is equivalent to an industrial furnace where coke can dissolve carbon into the SiMn alloy, and thus form SiC or graphite. Accumulation of graphite and SiC is believed to be bad for furnace operations. SiC that forms in a Mn-Si-Fe-C <b>saturated</b> <b>alloy</b> can have an interface structure of granular, angular grains and as dendrites. When SiC accumulates in the Mn-Si-Fe-C system, clusters of SiC particles with intermediate SiMn metal can form. This study shows that SiC clusters is typically a decade larger than the average SiC particle. The SiC particles settles {{at the top of the}} melt when a cooling rate of 18 &# 176;C per minute is used. Graphite that forms in the Mn-Si-Fe-C system have an interface structure of flakes. When the carbon content of the liquid SiMn is high enough, nucleation of new graphite grains happens instead of grain growth. The graphite flakes did not settle, but remained evenly dispersed in the SiMn alloy. This may be due to high viscosity in the melt, high friction on the graphite flakes or the buoyancy can be fairly equal to the drag of the graphite particles. The rate of formation of SiC and graphite in Mn-Si-Fe-C <b>saturated</b> <b>alloys</b> is reduced slightly by each consecutive temperature cycle. This suggest that SiC and graphite formed during the first cycles only partly dissolve into the liquid SiMn alloy to reach equilibrium in the system. </p...|$|R

40|$|Thermodynamic {{properties}} of Ga-In eutectic <b>alloys</b> <b>saturated</b> with praseodymium were determined {{for the first}} time employing the electromotive force method. The equilibrium potentials of the Pr-In <b>alloys</b> <b>saturated</b> with praseodymium (8. 7 - 12. 1 mol. % Pr) and Pr-Ga-In alloys (containing 0. 0012 - 6. 71 mol. % Pr) were measured between 573 - 1073 K. Pr-In alloy containing solid PrIn 3 with known thermodynamic properties was used as the reference electrode when measuring the potentials of ternary Pr-In-Ga alloys. Activity, partial and excessive thermodynamic functions of praseodymium in alloys with indium and Ga-In eutectic were calculated. Activity (a), activity coefficients (γ) and solubility (X) of praseodymium in the studied temperature range can be expressed by the following equations: lgaα-Pr(In) = 4. 425 - 11965 /T ± 0. 026. lgα-Pr(Ga-In) = 5. 866 - 14766 /T ± 0. 190. lgγα-Pr(Ga-In) = 2. 351 - 9996 /T ± 0. 39. lgPr(Ga-In) = 3. 515 - 4770 /T ± 0. 20. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Thermostimulated gas {{evolution}} from zirconium <b>alloy</b> <b>saturated</b> by hydrogen E_ 125 versus deformation degree has been studied. Samples of zirconium {{were subjected to}} straining with relative lengthening 2, 5; 5, 0 and 10, 0 %, then they were saturated with hydrogen by electrolyte method at current density 0, 5 A/sm 2 during 4 hours. Or vice versa, they were first saturated with hydrogen being subjected to deformation afterwards. The deformation of alloy samples results in trap formation with different energies of hydrogen bond. In this case both bond energy and hydrogen quantity caught in traps depends on both deformation size and succession of «deformation-saturation» actions. The values of hydrogen bond energies in traps are estimated. Types of traps are defined...|$|R
40|$|The {{wettability}} {{of tungsten}} carbide by liquid binders with various carbon contents and infiltration of WC-WC grain boundaries in cemented carbide by such binders were examined. The wettability of tungsten carbide by the liquid Co-based binder is complete at low carbon contents and becomes incomplete when increasing the carbon content. The wettability of WC by the Co-based binder <b>alloy</b> <b>saturated</b> with carbon is relatively poor with a wetting angle of about 15 °. The well-known phenomenon of Co migration from carbide regions with high carbon contents into regions with low carbon contents is presumably caused mainly by {{the variance in}} capillary forces related to the different wettability rates of WC by liquid binders with various carbon contents. The Co-based binders with various carbon contents are found to have different behaviors with respect to infiltrating WC-WC grain boundaries in cemented carbides during sintering. WC-WC interfaces in a cemented carbide sample with a high carbon content do not comprise nm-thick Co interlayers. In contrast to that, {{the majority of the}} WC-WC interfaces in a cemented carbide sample with a low carbon content comprise continuous Co interlayers of the order of at least several nanometers in thickness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Accumulative Roll Bonding (ARB) is a {{technique}} of grain refinement by severe plastic deformation, which involves multiple repetitions of surface treatment, stacking, rolling, and cutting. The rolling with 50 % reduction in thickness bonds the sheets. After several cycles, ultrafine-grained (UFG) materials are produced. Since ARB enables the production of large amounts of UFG materials, its adoption into industrial practice is favoured. ARB has been successfully used for preparation of UFG sheets from different ingot cast aluminium alloys. Twin-roll casting (TRC) is a cost and energy effective method for manufacturing aluminium sheets. Fine particles and small grain size are intrinsic for TRC sheets making them good starting materials for ARB. The paper {{presents the results of}} a research aimed at investigating the feasibility of ARB processing of three TRC alloys, AA 8006, AA 8011 and AA 5754, at ambient temperature. The microstructure and properties of the ARB were investigated by means of light and transmission electron microscopy and hardness measurements. AA 8006 specimens were ARB processed without any problems. Sound sheets of AA 8011 alloy were also obtained even after 8 cycles of ARB. The AA 5754 alloy suffered from severe edge and notch cracking since the first cycle. The work hardening of AA 8006 <b>alloy</b> <b>saturated</b> after the 3 rd cycle, whereas the hardness of AA 5754 alloy increased steadily up to the 5 th cycle. Monotonous increase in strength up to 280 MPa was observed in the ARB processed AA 8011 alloy...|$|R
