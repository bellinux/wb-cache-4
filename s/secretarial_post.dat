50|$|The left-wing {{was afraid}} that a purge would {{be used by the}} right-wing to remove those that the latter did not like. Over 100 members were excluded. The Congress in 1981 was also the basis for a {{compromise}} between the factions in SSU. Bo Bernhardsson won the vote on the Federal <b>secretarial</b> <b>post.</b> Chairman Jan Nygren, who was re-elected, and Bernhardsson came after some mutual distrust, cooperated and fighting in the Federation calmed down. This solution was repeated at the 2005 congress when the president and secretary were taken from a separate wing in order to calm conflicts in the organization.|$|E
5000|$|... 2005 {{revealed}} serious {{errors in}} SSU's members register. A {{large number of}} people were in the register without having paid a membership fee. The police launched an investigation when they suspected benefit fraud because SSU received financial assistance based on its membership. Records were updated and to Congress, the Federal proposed that central members should exercise better control, so that districts could not systematic cheating. The police closed the investigation for benefit fraud because the crime could not be proved and SSU free from all. Also at the 2005 Congress, the Board tried to achieve organizational unity by allowing the two factions to share the board equally. The federal leadership was divided up so that the right-wing got the chair Anna Sjödin and left-wing union <b>secretarial</b> <b>post</b> Mattias Vepsä.|$|E

60|$|Two <b>secretarial</b> <b>posts</b> {{did indeed}} seem to offer {{themselves}} in which, at least, {{there was no}} specific exclusion of womanhood; one was under a Radical Member of Parliament, and the other under a Harley Street doctor, and both men declined her proffered services with the utmost civility and admiration and terror. There was also a curious interview at a big hotel with a middle-aged, white-powdered woman, all covered with jewels and reeking of scent, who wanted a Companion. She did not think Ann Veronica would do as her companion.|$|R
50|$|She {{was born}} in 1927 in Niranam, Alleppey as the {{daughter}} of Ottavelil O. A. George and Anna Paul. She was the granddaughter of Malayalam author Pailo Paul. She grew up in Calicut and completed her intermediate from Providence Women's College and bachelor's degree ftom Malabar Christian College in Calicut. In 1949 she obtained her master's in English literature from Madras University. She passed the civil services examination in 1950. Her first posting as a civil servant was in Madras State and reportedly chief minister C. Rajagopalachari was sceptical about giving a woman the charge of a district sub collector and instead offered her a post in the Secretariat. She did not comply and was eventually posted as the Sub Collector of Tirupattur in Madras State, becoming the first woman to do so. She was also the first Malayali woman to hold a <b>secretarial</b> <b>post</b> in the central government. She was awarded Padma Bhushan in 1989.|$|E
5000|$|In 1932, at the grandly titled [...] "first world congress" [...] of the International Red Aid (IRH - workers' welfare) organisation, Rubiner {{was elected}} to a senior <b>secretarial</b> <b>post</b> with IRH, [...] which she held between December 1932 and August 1933. [...] Later {{she moved to the}} Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) where between 1932 (or 1933) and 1935 she headed up a {{department}} in the Press section. [...] In the wake of the murder of Sergey Kirov at the end of 1934 the ECCI underwent a general [...] "personnel purge", and Rubiner {{was the subject of a}} denunciation from a cell within the ECCI criticising her [...] "insufficient vigilance", based on the assertion that she had numbered among her acquaintances ECCI colleagues identified as [...] "enemies of the people". The reprimand was soon cancelled by the relevant Moscow Committee control commission. [...] Through the Stalinist purges of the later 1930s, any surveillance to which Rubiner was subject seems to have been relatively benign. [...] In 1936 she acquired Soviet citizenship.|$|E
5000|$|Early in 1789, as plans {{went forward}} for {{establishing}} the new Congress under the recently ratified Constitution, a heated contest {{developed for the}} job of Senate Secretary. The obvious candidate was dapper sixty-year-old Charles Thomson, secretary of the soon-to-expire Continental Congress during its entire fifteen-year existence. But Thomson weakened his candidacy by telling friends that he had a different <b>secretarial</b> <b>post</b> in mind—one in George Washington's cabinet. As the March 1789 convening date of the Senate neared, however, Thomson realized that he had no chance of landing a cabinet appointment. Consequently, he decided he would indeed like to become the first Secretary of the Senate—as well as Secretary of the House and Secretary of the entire government. This would not be too taxing, he thought, because he expected to have an assistant who would [...] "do the ordinary business of the Senate, so that I may not be under the necessity of attending except on special occasions and when the great business of the Nation is under deliberation." [...] This expression of Thomson's lofty self-importance helps explain why he had attracted a more-than-usual number of enemies during his public career.|$|E

2500|$|In many Western societies, brewing {{has been}} seen as a [...] "man's domain"; however, ethnographic studies and archaeological records {{indicate}} that brewing alcohol was primary an activity engaged in by women, until the industrialization of brewing began. In some areas, the tradition stemmed from the fact that brewing was a by-product of gathering, while in others, it fell within the domain of baking. Beginning in the 18th century, women were increasingly barred from the business of brewing, except as barmaids or [...] "publicans", licensees running pubs. From the 19th century, few women were employed in brewing with the exceptions of labor for auxiliary functions, such as bottling and <b>secretarial</b> <b>posts.</b> In the 20th century, women began to work in a limited capacity in laboratories, but with few exceptions, like Susannah Oland of Canada, women were excluded from directing brewing operations. Professional woman brewers in Western society are also known as [...] "brewmasters", though before the trade became [...] "masculinized", they were referred to as [...] "brewsters".|$|R

After serving on the staff of Headquarters Training Command from August 1955 to May 1957, he took command of RAAF Base Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. At this time No.86 Wing, operating Douglas Dakotas and Convair 440 Metropolitains, was located at Canberra, in part to satisfy the Federal government's VIP transport needs. Steege was promoted to acting group captain in May 1958 (substantive two months later), before becoming a senior planner at the SEATO Military Planning Office, Bangkok, in December 1958. He returned to the Department of Air in December 1961, where he rose to Director of Plans. Promoted to air commodore, he was appointed Officer Commanding (OC) RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, in November 1964. Amberley was home to the RAAF's bomber headquarters, No.82 Wing, which operated English Electric Canberra jets. In May 1967, Steege became OC RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia. [...] The RAAF maintained two squadrons of fighters at Butterworth: No.75 Squadron flying Dassault Mirages, and also No.77 Squadron flying CAC Sabres until 1969, and the Mirage-equipped No.3 Squadron after that.

5000|$|Around 1930 Luise Kraushaar took a <b>secretarial</b> <b>post</b> {{with the}} Communist Party, working for Leo Roth, a party officer {{identified}} {{in some quarters}} as [...] "Viktor", with links to Moscow. [...] Roth is sometimes identified as an [...] "agent" [...] or a man responsible for [...] "special contacts", but his precise role remains shadowy. He is described in one source as the nationwide head of the German Communist Party's Industrial Reporting Agency (Betriebsberichterstattung / BB-Apparat). [...] Kraushaar's secretarial tasks involved [...] "special duties" [...] such as decoding encrypted messages, as well as typing up reports and lists of names. [...] A bizarre aspect of her career at this time was that she worked {{in a room that}} the party had rented for her in a large residential apartment in Berlin's respectable but otherwise unremarkable Friedenau quarter. [...] The apartment was home to two sisters, the elder of whom, Rosa Dukas, handled the rental of the room and the younger of whom, Helen Dukas, was employed as a secretary by one of Berlin's most famous residents, Albert Einstein. The sisters went out to work during the day, so that for most of the time she was working in it Kraushaar had the apartment to herself. [...] Both Luise Kraushaar and Leo Roth had their own keys to the apartment. [...] Work in the BB-Apparat also brought her into contact with , another Communist activist who would oppose the Nazi government and in the end was killed in 1938 while participating in the Spanish Civil War. [...] Kraushaar undertook secretarial work for Bahnik until she emigrated in early 1934, at which point her secretarial duties in Berlin were taken over by [...] who would be shot at Ravensbrück in 1944.|$|E

50|$|The {{historical}} records give little {{information on the}} early parts of Liu Xiangdao's career. Early in the reign of Emperor Taizong's son and successor Emperor Gaozong, Liu Xiangdao served successively as assistant {{to the head of}} the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng), assistant imperial censor, and assistant minister of civil service affairs, all mid-level posts in the imperial administration. In 657, he was made assistant {{to the head of the}} examination bureau (門下省, Menxia Sheng), but continued to be responsible for civil service affairs. As he saw faults in the civil service selection process, he submitted a petition to Emperor Gaozong to request changes, and in the excerpts quoted by the Old Book of Tang, he raised six points—that the civil selection process was selecting too many people who were not virtuous; that the people chosen were simply too numerous; that there was insufficient attention paid to selecting diligent students of Confucianism; that awards should be given to people who recommended new talent; that the officials should be given longer office terms so that they would have time to carry out their plans; and that as it currently student, the prominent clans' members were declining important <b>secretarial</b> <b>posts,</b> which they viewed to be below their social station, when such posts were actually quite important in efficient imperial government. Emperor Gaozong apparently initially took no action on this petition, but when the chancellor Du Zhenglun expressed similar sentiments in 658, he had Du and Liu draft proposals for revising the civil service system, but there were many oppositions to their suggestions from established officials, and the recommendations were not acted upon. Later that year, on account of Liu's participation in revising the regulations on imperial ceremonies, his title was upgraded to Marquess of Yangcheng.|$|R
