2500|$|Because Vee-Jay {{wanted to}} get as many copies of the record pressed as quickly as possible, it did not insist on {{uniformity}} from one pressing plant to another. As a result, a dizzying number of label variations exist. Some of these added a comma to the song title, rendering it as [...] "Please, Please Me". Additionally, some copies of the record were issued with a picture sleeve. Early promotional copies had a <b>special</b> <b>sleeve</b> proclaiming [...] "Please Please Me" [...] as [...] "The Record That Started Beatlemania". The text on the sleeve noted that the Beatles had just appeared on Paar's program and were scheduled to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show in February. This sleeve is considered to be extremely rare.|$|E

50|$|Conductive {{charging}} {{requires a}} physical {{connection between the}} electronic device's battery and the power supply. The need for a metal-to-metal connection between the charger and the device requiring charging {{is one of the}} main drawbacks of this method. To accomplish this without the use of physical cords connected to wall outlets, special attachments are made from electronic devices which are fitted with technology that can detect when the device makes connection with the power source, often a charging base. Conduction based wireless accessories may include changeable backs for cellular phones, <b>special</b> <b>sleeves</b> and attachable clips.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{called a}} [...] "two-man puppet" [...] or a [...] "live-hand puppet", the human-arm puppet {{is similar to}} a hand puppet but is larger and {{requires}} two puppeteers. One puppeteer places a hand inside the puppet's head and operates its head and mouth while putting her other arm into a glove and <b>special</b> <b>sleeve</b> attached to the puppet (the right arm if they are left handed and left arm if they are right handed). The second puppeteer puts her arm into a glove and <b>special</b> <b>sleeve</b> attached to the puppet in order to operate the other arm. This way, the puppet can perform hand gestures. This is a form of glove or hand puppetry and rod puppetry.|$|E

5000|$|Armanetti {{exhibited}} extreme self-confidence {{upon entering}} the Garden. However, he was quickly paralyzed by a nerve gas. His confidence was crushed, as he began realizing he might die and burn in Hell eternally, as a punishment for not being religious all these years. The shock of the experience unlocked his ability to emit electromagnetic radiation blasts and he managed to set himself free by burning the gas toxins in his body. Subsequently, he took on the nom de guerre [...] "Radian" [...] and designed a costume with <b>special</b> <b>sleeves,</b> which helped him focus his blasts more effectively.|$|R

50|$|By 1943, {{a special}} staff non-commissioned officer position, known as Stabsscharführer had {{been adopted by}} the Waffen-SS. This position, {{equivalent}} to an army Hauptfeldwebel, was denoted by a <b>special</b> <b>sleeve</b> insignia and was not an actual rank, but rather a title for the head SS non-commissioned officer of a particular combat unit. The rank of Sturmscharführer was also unique to the Waffen-SS {{as a type of}} regimental sergeant major.|$|E
5000|$|In Roman times, {{the place}} of the glove was taken by long sleeves (manicae) {{reaching}} to the hand, and in winter <b>special</b> <b>sleeves</b> of fur were worn. In Medieval Latin we find the word muffulae, defined by Du Cange as chirothecae pellitae et hibernae ("leather winter gloves"). He quotes from a cartulary of the year 817, of the issuing to monks of sheepskin coverings to be used during the winter. These may have been, as the Roman certainly were, separate coverings for each hand, although the cartulary cited also distinguishes the glove for summer from the muffulae for winter wear. The Old French moufle meant a thick glove or mitten, and from this the Dutch mof, Walloon mouffe, and thence English [...] "muff", are probably derived.|$|R

50|$|Casters used in {{and around}} {{furnaces}} and ovens must withstand extreme heat. General purpose casters cannot survive excessive heat because tread materials, lubricants and other critical components can fail. For example, at 200 degrees F, common resilient tread materials are at or above their functional temperature limits. High temperature casters employ special lubricants and materials that can withstand higher heat. Additionally, for very high temperatures, <b>special</b> <b>sleeve</b> bearings may be used that have no lubricant whatsoever.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} analysis of shortcomings {{and benefits of}} individual techniques for the capital repair of out-of-commission water wells of standard designs. The author considers the capital repair procedure of water well No 3 B of Zhodino ‘Severniy’ water supply point by means of installing a repair filter of smaller diameter inside the failed one, cushioning the tubular annulus with gravel. It is shown {{that this kind of}} repair can be considered a temporary arrangement inasmuch as the water well specific yield and service life period will reduce significantly. For prolongation of the useful life of the water wells, the paper suggests performing preliminary unloading of their filters. The study reveals that the well capital repair by means of extracting the old filter and exchanging it with a new one can be complicated by the column burst along the welding joints working in tension. The performed column strength test demonstrated the fact that the required heave might exceed the welding joint tolerant tensile force owing to considerable friction of the column against the ground. The author arrives at a design equation of the heave required for extracting the production column with the filter applying only the static force. In which they offer to determine frictional force of the mudded filter against the formation from calculating formulae of the supporting power of an augered pile working with pulling loads. For decreasing the heaves via reducing frictional loads of the mudded filter against the formation, an improved design of the water well has been introduced recognized as an invention with the filter capable of downward biasing. Such water well design allows at the filter mud fill in the first instance the entire filtering column to be biased (knocked) down inside a <b>special</b> <b>sleeve</b> placed lower the settler by applying external buffing force, and then only extracting the filtering column out of the well by decreased traction pull. The energy balance equation for vertical displacement of the water well pipe column results in the computation expression for the hammer striking part weight and its drop height during the capital repair of the water well of improved design.  </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Intermittent {{pneumatic}} compression (IPC) improves haemodynamics in {{peripheral arterial disease}} (PAD), but {{its effects}} on foot perfusion were scarcely studied. In severe PAD patients we measured the foot oxygenation changes evoked by a novel intermittent IPC device (GP), haemodynamics and compliance to the treatment. Reference values were obtained by a sequential foot-calf device (SFC). METHODS: Twenty ischemic limbs (Ankle-Brachial Index = 0. 5 +/- 0. 2) of 12 PAD patients (7 male, age: 74. 5 +/- 10. 8 y) with an interval of 48 +/- 2 hours received a 35 minute treatment in supine position with two IPC devices: i) a Gradient Pump (GP), which slowly inflates a single thigh <b>special</b> <b>sleeve</b> and ii) an SFC (ArtAssist(R), ACI Medical, San Marcos, CA, USA), which rapidly inflates two foot-calf sleeves. Main outcome measure: changes of oxygenated haemoglobin at foot (HbO 2 foot) by continuous near-infrared spectroscopy recording and quantified as area-under-curve (AUC) for periods of 5 minutes. Other measures: haemodynamics by echo-colour Doppler (time average velocity (TAV) and blood flow (BF) in the popliteal artery and in the femoral vein), patient compliance by a properly developed form. RESULTS: All patients completed the treatment with GP, 9 with SFC. HbO 2 foot during the working phase, considered as average value of the 5 minutes periods, increased with GP (AUC 458 +/- 600 to 1216 +/- 280) and decreased with SFC (AUC 231 +/- 946 to - 1088 +/- 346), significantly for most periods (P < 0. 05). The GP treatment was associated to significant haemodynamic changes from baseline to end of the treatment (TAV = 10. 2 +/- 3. 3 to 13. 5 +/- 5. 5 cm/sec, P = 0. 004; BF = 452. 0 +/- 187. 2 to 607. 9 +/- 237. 8 ml/sec, P = 0. 0001), not observed with SFC (TAV = 11. 2 +/- 3. 4 to 11. 8 +/- 4. 3 cm/sec; BF = 513. 8 +/- 203. 7 to 505. 9 +/- 166. 5 ml/min, P = n. s.). GP obtained a higher score of patient compliance (P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: A novel IPC thigh device, unlike a traditional SFC device, increased foot oxygenation in severe PAD, together with favourable haemodynamic response and high compliance to the treatment under the present experimental conditions...|$|E
