5|$|The <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> {{no longer}} an option {{and there is an}} unquenchable desire for greater devolution. Quite simply, the Scottish people want to be more {{directly}} and deeply involved in the decisions that affect them and the generations to come. It is with this uppermost in mind that today we launch The National, a daily newspaper that will fly a vibrant flag for independence and the right for Scots to govern themselves.|$|E
25|$|Many Palestinians {{believe the}} <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> {{threatened}} since right-wing Israelis have been challenging it with more force and frequency, asserting a religious right to pray there. Until Israel banned them, members of Murabitat, {{a group of}} women, cried 'Allah Akbar' at groups of Jewish visitors to remind them the Temple Mount was still in Muslim hands.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the bill, a {{statement}} from Taipei's Mainland Affairs Council and a resolution overwhelming passed by the ROC legislature stated that the <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> that the Republic of China is sovereign and independent. The statement and resolution were carefully worded to avoid disagreements between the pan-blue and pan-green coalition over whether the Republic of China has any residual sovereignty over Mainland China.|$|E

Mega Man then discovers that Wily was responsible for arresting Dr. Light, and that Light has fallen ill. Afterward, Mega Man's ally Proto Man comes in and warns the hero {{that it is a}} trap, stating that the seemingly ill scientist is an impostor used by Wily to make the initial news video. Mega Man then takes his chances with Wily, and while he is disabled when Wily's fortress comes down on him, Proto Man returns quickly to save him. In the end, Dr. Wily escapes, Dr. Light is freed, and the <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> restored. The eight Robot Masters are rebuilt and given new functions working alongside Light and his other robots.|$|E
500|$|The song's tone {{implies that}} the speaker feels {{powerless}} against the discrimination and racism that he encounters; despite this, by [...] "spreading the news" [...] of his poor treatment in a song, the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern African Americans and northern whites that the <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> deeply flawed and that something needs to change.|$|E

I want the joy that I {{used to get}} seeing Godzilla toss a tank without having to think there are guys in the tank… What I think is you could do nothing but echo the moment you're in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile the <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> {{and the safety of}} citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E

500|$|According to Rhonda Wilcox and J. P. Williams in [...] "What Do You Think? The X-Files, Liminality, and Gender Pleasure", [...] "Humbug" [...] {{is about}} [...] "difference, sex, and looking". Regarding The X-Files as a whole, {{they say that}} the {{relationship}} between Mulder and Scully is non-sexual and [...] "quasi-marital". Although sharing a degree of intimacy that allows them to share each other's space, they avoid a sexual or objectifying gaze: [...] "They look into each other's eyes and argue ideas, rather than gazing at each other's bodies." [...] This <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> challenged in this episode as the objectifying gaze is highlighted and deconstructed, although not between the partners themselves. According to Wilcox and Williams, a key scene involves Agent Scully and Lanny. When Lanny goes to wake Scully in her trailer one morning, he catches a glimpse of her breasts; she inadvertently exposes herself as she in turn catches sight of Lanny's uncovered parasitic twin; [...] "each gaze involves the objectification of difference". This objectification is emphasized by the fact that Scully's body is not normally revealed in this way.|$|E

2500|$|The third {{condition}} has especially {{caused a}} stir in Taiwan as the term [...] "indefinitely" [...] is open to interpretation.

2500|$|In addition, the {{situation}} can be confusing {{because of the}} different parties and the effort by many groups {{to deal with the}} controversy through a policy of deliberate ambiguity. [...] The political solution that is accepted by many of the current groups is the perspective of the status quo: to unofficially treat Taiwan as a state and at a minimum, to officially declare no support for the government of this state making a formal declaration of independence. What a formal declaration of independence would consist of is not clear. The <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> accepted in large part because it does not define the legal or future status of Taiwan, leaving each group to interpret {{the situation}} {{in a way that is}} politically acceptable to its members. [...] At the same time, a policy of status quo has been criticized as being dangerous precisely because different sides have different interpretations of what the <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is,</b> leading to the possibility of war through brinkmanship or miscalculation.|$|E

2500|$|Multiple {{opinion polls}} {{conducted}} in Taiwan {{have indicated that}} {{there is very little}} support for immediate unification on the PRC's terms or for an immediate declaration of independence. Polls have also consistently shown that a large majority of Taiwanese would support discussion of reunification only if the economic and political systems of {{the two sides of the}} straits were comparable. A majority of Taiwanese appear to support the [...] "status quo" [...] but there are different opinions in Taiwanese society, with the PRC, and in the international community over what the <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is.</b> A full 74 percent of the Taiwanese public agree that [...] "Taiwan is an independent sovereign country" ...|$|E
2500|$|Chaudhry {{also spoke}} {{in favour of}} {{bringing}} more ethnic Fijians into the economic mainstream. [...] He attacked {{what he called the}} [...] "divide and rule" [...] policies of Fiji's former British colonial rulers, saying that indigenous Fijians had been isolated from other communities and marginalized economically. This colonial legacy had remained the status quo in society, even since independence in 1970, he maintained. [...] "The <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> not good for the ordinary Fijians. It is good for the elites in society but not for the ordinary Fijians," [...] Chaudhry said. Positive discrimination programs would not achieve much without a dismantling of the traditional communal mindset, he said. He called for a more individualistic approach to society, based on incentives and appropriate training. [...] He did not believe that modernization would threaten the communal structure of Fijian society. [...] "No you can still fulfil your traditional obligations but the contradiction in the system between the communal approach and the free market approach needs to be addressed," [...] he said. He also insisted that culture could not be allowed to be stagnant.|$|E
2500|$|According to a June 2008 poll from a Taiwanese {{mainstream}} media TVBS, 58% {{of people living}} in Taiwan favor maintaining the status quo, 19% favors independence, and 8% favors unification.

The same poll also reveals that, in terms of self-identity, when the respondents are not told that a Taiwanese can also be a Chinese, 68% of the respondents identify themselves as [...] "Taiwanese" [...] while 18% would call themselves [...] "Chinese". However, when the respondents are told that duo identity is an option, 45% of the respondents identify themselves as [...] "Taiwanese only", 4% of the respondents call themselves [...] "Chinese only" [...] while 45% of the respondents call themselves [...] "both Taiwanese as well as Chinese". [...] Furthermore, when it comes to preference in which national identity to be used in international organizations, 54% of people in the survey indicated that they prefer [...] "Taiwan" [...] and only 25% of the people voted for [...] "Chinese Taipei".|$|E

2500|$|The castle {{gatehouse}} is in poor {{condition and}} {{has been added to}} English Heritage's Heritage at Risk register. The building has repeatedly been vandalised and is suffering the effects of the weather. The site is within the boundaries of the North York Moors National Park, and the National Park Authority, English Heritage and the site owner have collaborated to develop a plan to conserve the site. A report produced for the park authority in 2005 examined several options, including retaining the building as ruins but improving security by employing a custodian, converting the gatehouse into a liveable property for use as a house or holiday home, or establishing a local community group to help manage and maintain the site. The option of converting the gatehouse was recommended. The report concluded that [...] "retention of the <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> not felt to be an acceptable option, due to continuing damage through vandalism to the historic fabric and archaeology, together with the impaired public enjoyment and the uneconomic nature of future repairs and maintenance to the site." [...] English Heritage part-funded a feasibility study to assess the prospects of turning the gatehouse into a home. However, these plans fell through due to the collapse into administration of the Vivat Trust, which had proposed the conversion.|$|E
2500|$|The spell {{itself and}} its {{consequences}} are certainly less easy to work out effectively than {{was the case with}} the famous spell in The Sorcerer.... After this the fun soon becomes fast and furious — too furious to be in our judgment characteristic of the author's happiest manner. [...] There is certainly a good deal of drollery in Foggerty's interview with Malvina de Vere, and their friendly steps towards an action for breach of promise. [...] But there is almost too much of it, and there is certainly too much of the satire upon mad-doctors and their ways which occurs when Foggerty's friends believe him demented, and try to get a certificate to that effect from Dr. Lobb and Dr. Dobb. The climax, therefore, which is brought about when the hero takes a pill, summons the fairy once more, and brings matters back to their <b>status</b> <b>quo,</b> <b>is</b> very welcome, for towards the last the fun is felt to be flagging. [...] The mad dream has been almost too long as well as too elaborate in its absurdities. [...] This fault, if it be found to exist, can, of course, be readily remedied, as there seems no real need for the hero's false confession, à la Topsy, of a crime which he never committed.|$|E
2500|$|Defenses of wage {{labor and}} chattel {{slavery in the}} {{literature}} have linked the subjection of man to man with the subjection of man to nature; arguing that hierarchy and a social system's particular relations of production represent human nature and are no more coercive than the reality of life itself. According to this narrative, any well-intentioned attempt to fundamentally change the <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> naively utopian and will result in more oppressive conditions. Bosses {{in both of these}} long-lasting systems argued that their system created a lot of wealth and prosperity. In some sense, both did create jobs and their investment entailed risk. For example, slave owners risked losing money by buying chattel slaves who later became ill or died; while bosses risked losing money by hiring workers (wage slaves) to make products that didn't sell well on the market. Marginally, both chattel and wage slaves may become bosses; sometimes by working hard. It may be the [...] "rags to riches" [...] story which occasionally occurs in capitalism, or the [...] "slave to master" [...] story that occurred in places like colonial Brazil, where slaves could buy their own freedom and become business owners, self-employed, or slave owners themselves. Social mobility, or the hard work and risk that it may entail, are thus not considered to be a redeeming factor by critics of the concept of wage slavery.|$|E
