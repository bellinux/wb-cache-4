40|$|Abstract-With the {{development}} of reliable and inexpensive digital cameras, numerous individuals have reported capturing anomalous round-shaped (orbic) objects in photographs. These seemingly anomalous orbic images (AOIs) have sometimes been interpreted as reflecting "spirits, " "angels, " "light beings," "aliens, " and/or "UFOs. " We decided to determine whether we could (1) replicate capturing AOIs, and (2) investigate their possible mechanism(s). Approximately one thousand photographs were taken with five different digital cameras over multiple sessions under conditions that would purportedly increase the chance of observing AOIs. This included two "spiritual energy healers " performing various diagnostic and treatment procedures in a semi-dark room. More than two hundred photographs contained AOIs. Careful examination of the photographs revealed a plausible conventional optical mechanism that could explain most of the AOIs observed. The most common mechanisms involved are (I) stray reflections (often from the flash) from various shiny objects in the environment (mirrors, glass windows, doorknobs, furniture, metal art work) that are then doubly re-reflected off of lens surfaces and (2) diffraction from the flash reflecting off of dust and dirt particles near {{but not on the}} lens. Spiritual or other-worldly interpretations of "orbs " in photographs should only be considered under conditions in which all sources of <b>stray</b> <b>reflection</b> and diffraction have been eliminated from the environment...|$|E

40|$|Shack-Hartmann {{wavefront}} sensors (SH-WFS) {{have little}} sensitivity in depth and hence are unsuitable for microscopy and are limited for retinal imaging. We demonstrate the first direct Shack-Hartmann measurement of wavefront originating from a multiple-layer target, {{in the presence}} of significant <b>stray</b> <b>reflections</b> that render a standard SH-WFS inoperable. A coherence-gate SH-WFS is implemented by adding time-domain low-coherence reflectometry gating to an SH-WFS configuration. The depth resolution is determined by the operational depth selection of the coherence gate, much narrower than the depth range of the SH-WFS. Five distinctive wavefronts are measured from five layers of a multiple-layer target. This paves the way toward depth-resolved wavefront sensing, which can significantly improve adaptive optics closed loops applied to microscopy and imaging of the retina.

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{demonstrate}} results of measuring wavefront aberrations from different depths in a fabricated phantom using a coherence-gated Shack-Hartman wavefront sensing technique (CG-SH/WFS). The SH/WFS {{is equipped with}} a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and the coherence gate operates on principles of swept source (SS) interferometry. The CG-SH/WFS is able to differentiate wavefront signals from different depths separated by a depth resolution of 7. 1 micron. The CG-SH/WFS delivers a similar SH spot pattern as that provided by a conventional SH/WFS. Due to the coherence gate, the sensor is capable of eliminating <b>stray</b> <b>reflections.</b> Hereby we present the results of measuring depth-resolved wavefront aberrations.

These optics {{have the potential to}} introduce wavefront errors and <b>stray</b> <b>reflections</b> at the subaperture level that will bias the phasing measurement. We present laboratory data to quantify this effect, using measured errors from Keck and two other lenslet arrays. In addition, as part of the design of the Thirty Meter Telescope Alignment and Phasing System we present a preliminary investigation of a lenslet-free approach that relies on Fresnel diffraction to form the subimages at the CCD.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we {{investigate}} the possibility of narrowing the depth range of a physical Shack - Hartmann (SH) wavefront sensor (WFS) by using coherence gating. For the coherence gating, two low coherence interferometry (LCI) methods are evaluated and proof of principle configurations demonstrated: (i) a time domain LCI method based on phase shifting interferometry and (ii) a spectral domain LCI method, based on tuning a narrow band optical source. The two configurations are used to demonstrate each, the possibility of constructing a coherence gated (CG) SH/WFS. It is shown that these configurations produce spot patterns similar to those provided by a conventional SH/WFS. The two proof of principle configurations are also used to illustrate elimination of <b>stray</b> <b>reflections</b> in the interface optics which normally disturb the operation of conventional SH/WFSs.

40|$|The {{imperfection}} {{of optical}} devices in an optical imaging system deteriorates wavefront {{which results in}} aberration. This reduces the optical {{signal to noise ratio}} of the imaging system {{and the quality of the}} produced images. Adaptive optics composed of wavefront sensor (WFS) and deformable mirror (DM) is a straightforward solution for this problem. The need for a WFS in an AO system, raises the cost of the overall system, and there are also instances when they cannot be used, such as in microscopy. Moreover <b>stray</b> <b>reflections</b> from lens surfaces affect the performance of the WFS. In this paper, we describe a blind optimization technique with an in-expensive electronics without using the WFS to correct the aberration in order to achieve better quality images. The correction system includes an electromagnetic DM from Imagine, Mirao 52 d, with 52 actuators which are controlled by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

40|$|Earlier this year, British sculptor, Anish Kapoor {{was given}} {{exclusive}} rights to use a new spray-on carbon nanotube-based paint.

40|$|The images {{obtained}} from confocal imaging systems present less resolution than the theoretical limit due to imperfection of the optical components and their arrangement. This imperfection deteriorates the wavefront and introduces aberrations to the optical system. Adaptive optics (AO) systems {{composed of a}} wavefront sensor (WFS) and a deformable mirror represent the most used solution to this problem. Such adaptive optics systems are expensive. In addition, in microscopy, WFSs cannot {{be used due to}} <b>stray</b> <b>reflections</b> in the system and high aberrations introduced by the specimen. For these reasons, sensor-less AO systems have been developed to control the deformable mirror (DM) using an optimization algorithm in an iterative manner. At each iteration, the algorithm produces a new set of voltage and sends it to the mirror so as to optimize its shape, in such a way, as to maximize the strength of the photodetector current in the imaging system. In this paper the results of the application of three optimization techniques in the sensor-less AO are compared. The three optimization techniques are simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). SA and GA have been previously implemented and PSO is explained in this paper. Â© 2011 SPIE. ...|$|R

40|$|The Retirement For Cause (RFC) {{inspection}} system uses both eddy current and ultrasonics for the real-time inspection of {{gas turbine engine}} components. The ultrasonic inspection module uses a squirter technique to couple the ultrasound to the engine part. The current flaw detection requirement for the ultrasonic system is 0. 020 inch diameter, mal-oriented, penny-shaped, internal voids and extensive testing {{has shown that the}} squirter technique is comparable to immersion for the detection of these type defects [1, 2]. The signal-to-noise ratio is nearly the same for both techniques with only occasional water noise signals occuring in the squirter technique. Additionally, on complex geometries, low amplitude reflections from the nozzle are sometimes present. A typical scan of a bore of an engine part (see Figure 1) has approximately 40, 000 A-scans with each A-scan having 300 – 1000 digitized points; thus even an occasional noise signal can add up to many false indications over the course of an entire scan. For example, using the above numbers a noise signal 0. 01 % of the time would result in 2000 “flaw indications” in one scan. To help reduce the number of noise-induced flaw indications, an algorithm has been developed to allow the system to distinguish between a signal from an actual defect and one induced by <b>stray</b> <b>reflections,</b> electrical, or water noise...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTotal {{internal}} reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) achieves subdiffraction axial sectioning by confining fluorophore excitation to {{a thin layer}} close to the cell/substrate boundary. However, it is often unknown how thin this light sheet actually is. Particularly in objective-type TIRFM, large deviations from the exponential intensity decay expected for pure evanescence have been reported. Nonevanescent excitation light diminishes the optical sectioning effect, reduces contrast, and renders TIRFM-image quantification uncertain. To identify the sources of this unwanted fluorescence excitation in deeper sample layers, we here combine azimuthal and polar beam scanning (spinning TIRF), atomic force microscopy, and wavefront analysis of beams passing through the objective periphery. Using a variety of intracellular fluorescent labels as well as negative staining experiments to measure cell-induced scattering, we find that azimuthal beam spinning produces TIRFM images that more accurately portray the real fluorophore distribution, but these images are still hampered by far-field excitation. Furthermore, although clearly measureable, cell-induced scattering is not the dominant source of far-field excitation light in objective-type TIRF, at least for most types of weakly scattering cells. It is the microscope illumination optical path that produces a large cell- and beam-angle invariant stray excitation that is insensitive to beam scanning. This instrument-induced glare is produced far from the sample plane, inside the microscope illumination optical path. We identify <b>stray</b> <b>reflections</b> and high-numerical aperture aberrations of the TIRF objective as one important source.

40|$|AbstractAzimuthal beam {{scanning}} makes evanescent-wave (EW) excitation isotropic, thereby producing {{total internal reflection}} fluorescence (TIRF) images that are evenly lit. However, beam spinning does not fundamentally {{address the problem of}} propagating excitation light that is contaminating objective-type TIRF. Far-field excitation depends more on the specific objective than on cell scattering. As a consequence, the excitation impurities in objective-type TIRF are only weakly affected by changes of azimuthal or polar beam angle. These are the main results of {{the first part of this}} study (Eliminating unwanted far-field excitation in objective-type TIRF. Pt. 1. Identifying sources of nonevanescent excitation light). This second part focuses on exactly where up beam in the illumination system stray light is generated that gives rise to nonevanescent components in TIRF. Using dark-field imaging of scattered excitation light we pinpoint the objective, intermediate lenses and, particularly, the beam scanner as the major sources of stray excitation. We study how adhesion-molecule coating and astrocytes or BON cells grown on the coverslip surface modify the dark-field signal. On flat and weakly scattering cells, most background comes from <b>stray</b> <b>reflections</b> produced far from the sample plane, in the beam scanner and the objective lens. On thick, optically dense cells roughly half of the scatter is generated by the sample itself. We finally show that combining objective-type EW excitation with supercritical-angle fluorescence (SAF) detection efficiently rejects the fluorescence originating from deeper sample regions. We demonstrate that SAF improves the surface selectivity of TIRF, even at shallow penetration depths. The coplanar microscopy scheme presented here merges the benefits of beam spinning EW excitation and SAF detection and provides the conditions for quantitative wide-field imaging of fluorophore dynamics at or near the plasma membrane...|$|R

40|$|Antenna is an {{indispensable}} {{part of a}} radar or free space communication system. Antenna requires different stringent specifications for different applications. Designed and fabricated for an intended application, antenna or antenna array has to be evaluated for its far-field characteristics in real free space environment which requires setting up of far-field test site. Maintenance of the site to keep the <b>stray</b> <b>reflections</b> levels low, {{the cost of the}} real estate are some of the disadvantages. Nearfield measurements are compact and can be used to test the antennas by exploiting the relationship between near-field and far-field. It is shown that the far-field patterns of an antenna can be sufficiently accurately predicted provided the near-field measurements are accurate. Due to limitation in the near-field measurement systems, errors creep in corrupting the nearfield-measured data thus making error in prediction of the far field. All these errors ultimately corrupt the phase and amplitude data. In this thesis, one such near-field measurement facility, the Planar Near Field Measurement facility is discussed. The limitations of the facility and the errors that occur due to their limitations are discussed. Various errors that occur in measurements ultimately corrupt the near-field phase and amplitude. Investigations carried out aim at a detailed study of these phase and amplitude errors and their effect on the far-field patterns of the antenna. Depending on the source of error, the errors are classified as spike, pulse and random errors. The location of occurrence of these types of errors in the measurement plane, their effects on the far-field of the antenna is studied both for phase and amplitude errors. The studies conducted for various phase and amplitude errors show that the near-field phase and amplitude data are more tolerant to random errors as the far-field patterns do not get affected even for low sidelobe cases. The spike errors, though occur as a wedge at a single point in the measurement plane, have more pronounced effect on the far-field patterns. Lower the taper value of the antenna, more pronounced is the error. It is also noticed that the far-field pattern gets affected only in the plane where the error has occurred and has no effect in the orthogonal plane. Pulse type of errors which occur even for a short length in the measurement affect both the principle plane far-field patterns. This study can be used extensively as a tool to determine to the level to which various error such as mechanical, RF etc need to be controlled to make useful and correct pattern predictions on a particular facility. Thereby, the study {{can be used as a}} tool to economise the budget of the facility wherein the parameters required for building the facility need not be over specified beyond the requirement.

40|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{properties of}} materials we observe emerge from the collective structural configuration and dynamical behavior of the atomic or molecular constituents. Therefore, in order to fully characterize and understand these properties, {{it is necessary to}} develop measurement techniques capable of probing at these scales. Such a technique is that of combining scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy with ultrafast spectroscopy. Traditional, far-field microscopy is limited by diffraction, making it impossible to resolve details smaller than approximately half the wavelength of the illuminating light. However, the electromagnetic field that is produced when an object is illuminated is not simply characterized by the light that carries energy, radiating to the far-field, but also consists of a more structured rapidly decaying evanescent field. The structure of this evanescent, nonradiating near-field is not limited by diffraction, and so in measuring this field, it is possible to resolve the microstructure of matter {{in a way that is}} independent of the illuminating wavelength. By placing a metallic tip close enough to the surface to be within this evanescent field, the electric near-field is then scattered off of it, allowing it to be observed. Through the measurement of backscattered light off of nanometer scale probes developed for the use in scanning probe microscopy, near-field detection was realized in the form of scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy, allowing wavelength independent but spectroscopically sensitive imaging with nanoscale resolution. However, background interference from <b>stray</b> <b>reflections</b> usually overwhelm the back-scattered signal. By oscillating the tip at its mechanical resonant frequency, the near-field component of the signal can be detected in the anharmonic response to this modulation. This anharmonicity appears in the Fourier components of frequencies at integer multiples of the modulation frequency, a type of demodulation done through the use of a lock-in amplifier. However, a lock-in amplifier continuously samples the detector, while to obtain temporal resolution, a pulsed laser sources are necessary. By measuring the response of a sample to an initial excitation with a time delayed secondary laser pulse in pump-probe spectroscopy, the time dependence of an excitation can be measured. However, if the repetition rate of this pulsed laser is close to the modulation frequency of the tip, a lock-in amplifier will have difficulty demodulating the near-field signal. As an alternative to lock-in detection, we developed a method which synchronized data acquisition with the repetition rate of the laser pulse source, acquiring data only when the signal at the photodetector is at its maximum. In doing so, we were not only able to improve the signal quality as compared to that of a lock-in amplifier, as measured in the noise of approach curves over a gold surface and in a raster scan of a gold-silicon step edge, we were also able to apply an alternative method of near-field detection whereby we compared the curvature of the tip-scattered signal at the top and bottom of the tip-oscillation. This was similarly demonstrated in an approach curve over gold and in a raster scan over the step edge. Also, since the data were saved onto a computer, we were able to apply post-processing, enabling us to improve this method of curvature comparison, and create an approach curve showing a very clear near-field signal with little far-field interference. Therefore, in developing this data collection technique, we have demonstrated both an improvement to traditional lock-in detection when applied to pulsed laser sources along with a capability of implementing near-field reconstruction beyond that of harmonic demodulation...|$|R
