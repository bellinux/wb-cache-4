25|$|Many new {{intravenous}} and inhalational anesthetics {{were developed}} and brought into clinical {{use during the}} second half of the 20th century. Paul Janssen (1926–2003), the founder of Janssen Pharmaceutica, is credited with the development of over 80 pharmaceutical compounds. Janssen synthesized nearly all of the butyrophenone class of antipsychotic agents, beginning with haloperidol (1958) and droperidol (1961). These agents were rapidly integrated into the practice of anesthesia. In 1960, Janssen's team synthesized fentanyl, the first of the piperidinone-derived opioids. Fentanyl was followed by <b>sufentanil</b> (1974), alfentanil (1976), carfentanil (1976), and lofentanil (1980). Janssen and his team also developed etomidate (1964), a potent intravenous anesthetic induction agent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sufentanil</b> (R30730, {{brand name}} Sufenta) is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic drug approximately 5 to 10 times more potent than its parent drug, fentanyl, and 500 times as potent as morphine. Structurally, <b>sufentanil</b> differs from fentanyl through {{the addition of}} a methoxymethyl group on the piperidine ring (which is believed to reduce duration of action), and the replacement of the phenyl ring by thiophene. <b>Sufentanil</b> first was synthesized at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1974.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sufentanil</b> is marketed {{for use by}} {{specialist}} centers {{under different}} trade names, such as Sufenta and Sufentil. <b>Sufentanil</b> with and without lidocaine or mepivacaine is available as a transdermal patch similar to Duragesic in Europe under trade names such as Chronogesic.|$|E

50|$|Because <b>sufentanil</b> is very potent, {{practitioners}} must {{be prepared}} to reverse the effects of the drug should the patient exhibit symptoms of overdose such as respiratory depression or respiratory arrest. As for all other opioid-based medications, naloxone (trade name Narcan) is the definitive antidote for overdose. Depending on the amount administered, it can reverse the respiratory depression and, if enough is administered, completely reverse the effects of <b>sufentanil.</b>|$|E
50|$|The main {{use of this}} {{medication}} is in operating suites and critical care where pain relief is required {{for a short period}} of time. It also offers properties of sedation and this makes it a good analgesic component of anesthetic regimen during an operation. It is usually administered under the doctor's order through an intravenous route. In some countries, <b>sufentanil</b> is only indicated for epidural use. Despite this, it is often used off-label both intravenously and intranasally. A transdermal <b>sufentanil</b> patch called Transdur-sufentanil is about to enter Stage III clinical trials by Durect Corp for the relief of chronic pain, and has the advantage over fentanyl patches such as Duragesic of only needing to be applied once per week. <b>Sufentanil</b> is also used off-label in intrathecal pumps.|$|E
50|$|Because of its {{extremely}} high potency, {{it is often}} used in surgery and post-operative pain management for patients that are heavily opioid dependent/opioid tolerant because of long term opiate use for chronic pain or illicit opiate use. Currently <b>sufentanil</b> is the strongest opioid painkiller available for use in humans. Although stronger narcotic pain medications do exist, all medications stronger than <b>sufentanil</b> are approved for veterinary use only. It is also used in surgery and post operative pain control in patients that are taking high dose buprenorphine for chronic pain {{because it is the}} only opioid that has a potency and binding affinity strong enough to displace buprenorphine from the opioid receptors in the central nervous system and provide analgesia.|$|E
50|$|Thomas Zilker: It {{seems to}} be {{different}} from fentanyl, carfentanil and <b>sufentanil</b> but it has to be, it has to have the potency of carfentanil at least because otherwise it wouldn’t work in these circumstance. So the Russians obviously have designed a new fentanyl which we cannot detect in the west.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to blocking the nerves which carry pain, local anaesthetic {{drugs in the}} epidural space will block other types of nerves as well, in a dose-dependent manner. Depending on the drug and dose used, the effects may last {{only a few minutes}} or up to several hours. Epidural analgesia typically involves using the opiates fentanyl or <b>sufentanil,</b> with bupivacaine or one of its congeners. Fentanyl is a powerful opioid with a potency 80 times that of morphine and side effects common to the opiate class. <b>Sufentanil</b> is another opiate, 5 to 10 times more potent than Fentanyl. Bupivacaine is markedly toxic if inadvertently given intravenously, causing excitation, nervousness, tingling around the mouth, tinnitus, tremor, dizziness, blurred vision, or seizures, followed by depression: drowsiness, loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and apnea. Bupivacaine has caused several deaths by cardiac arrest when epidural anaesthetic has been accidentally inserted into a vein instead of the epidural space.|$|E
50|$|Choice of agentsA person {{receiving}} an epidural for pain relief may receive local anaesthetic, an opioid, or both. Common local anaesthetics include lidocaine, mepivacaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and chloroprocaine. Common opioids include hydromorphone, morphine, fentanyl, <b>sufentanil,</b> and pethidine (known as meperidine in the United States). These are injected in relatively small doses, compared {{to when they}} are injected intravenously. Other agents such as clonidine or ketamine are also sometimes used.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} {{anaesthetic}} premedication is the preoperative administration of beta adrenergic antagonists {{to reduce the}} incidence of postoperative hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmia, or myocardial infarction. Anaesthesiologists may administer an antiemetic agent such as ondansetron, droperidol, or dexamethasone to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting, or subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin to {{reduce the incidence of}} deep vein thrombosis. Other commonly used premedication agents include opioids such as fentanyl or <b>sufentanil,</b> gastrokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, and histamine antagonists such as famotidine.|$|E
50|$|R-30490 (also {{known as}} 4-Methoxymethylfentanyl) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{related to the}} highly potent animal tranquilizer carfentanil, and with only slightly lower potency. It was first synthesised {{by a team of}} chemists at Janssen Pharmaceutica led by Paul Janssen, who were investigating the structure-activity relationships of the fentanyl family of drugs. R-30490 was found to be the most selective agonist for the μ-opioid receptor out of all the fentanyl analogues tested, but it has never been introduced for medical use in humans, although the closely related drug <b>sufentanil</b> is widely used for analgesia and anesthesia during major surgery.|$|E
50|$|Carbenicillin {{is used in}} {{the clinic}} {{primarily}} because of its low toxicity and its utility in treating urinary tract infections due to susceptible Pseudomonas species. Its low potency, low oral activity, and susceptibility to bacterial beta-lactamases make it vulnerable to replacement by agents without these deficits. One contender in this race is ticaricillin. Its origin depended on the well-known fact that a divalent sulfur is roughly equivalent to a vinyl group (cf methiopropamine, <b>sufentanil,</b> pizotyline etc.).One synthesis began by making the monobenzyl ester of 3-Thienylmalonic acid, converting this to the acid chloride with SOCl2, and condensing it with 6-Aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA). Hydrogenolysis (Pd/C) completed the synthesis of ticarcillin.|$|E

50|$|Midazolam is {{effective}} in children in reducing anxiety associated with separation from parents and induction of anesthesia. <b>Sufentanil</b> is also sometimes used as a premedication. Clonidine is becoming increasingly popular as a premedication for children. One drawback of clonidine {{is that it can}} take up to 45 minutes to take full effect. In children, clonidine {{has been found to be}} equal to and possibly superior to benzodiazepines as a premedication. It has a more favourable side effect profile. It also reduces the need for an induction agent. It improves post-operative pain relief, is better at inducing sedation at induction, reduces agitated emergence, reduces shivering and post-operative nausea and vomiting and reduces post-operative delirium associated with sevoflurane anaesthesia. Benzodiazepines such as midazolam are more commonly used due largely to a lack of a marketing effort by the pharmaceutical companies. As a result, clonidine is becoming increasingly popular with anesthesiologists. Dexmedetomidine and atypical antipsychotic agents are other premedications which are used particularly in very uncooperative children.|$|E
5000|$|Lofentanil is {{very similar}} to {{carfentanil}} in effects, but has a longer duration of action. This makes it unsuitable for most practical applications, with carfentanil being the preferred agent for tranquilizing large animals, and short-acting derivatives such as <b>sufentanil</b> or remifentanil being preferred for medical use in human surgical procedures. The long duration and high lipophilicity of lofentanil has been suggested as an advantage for certain types of analgesia, but the main application for lofentanil at the present time is research into opioid receptors. [...] Side effects of fentanyl analogs {{are similar to those of}} fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea, and potentially serious respiratory depression, which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear. Side effects from lofentanil might be particularly problematic given its reportedly long duration of action. Another side effect which is characteristic of fentanyl and its derivatives is their tendency to rapidly induce tolerance, due to their high binding affinity triggering rapid internalization of chronically activated opiate receptors. This might be expected to be a particular problem with lofentanil as it is not only one of the most potent drugs in the series, but also is longer acting than most other fentanyl analogues, meaning that development of tolerance triggered by receptor over-activation is likely to be especially rapid, occurring with as little as a single active dose.|$|E
40|$|Background. Alpha(2) -adrenoceptor agonists, such as clonidine. can potentiate the {{analgesic}} {{properties of}} spinal opioids. In order to further extend this observation to highly lipophilic and potent spinally acting opioids, {{we tested the}} interactions between clonidine and <b>sufentanil</b> after both epidural and intrathecal administration in rats. Methods. The rats were equipped with spinal catheters. Antinociceptive testing was performed with the Tail Withdrawal Reaction test. Dose-response functions of <b>sufentanil,</b> clonidine and combinations of clonidine plus <b>sufentanil</b> were determined. Results. These indicated that 1) <b>sufentanil,</b> but not clonidine alone, results in a dose-related antinociception after both the epidural and the intrathecal route of administration; 2) In combination with normally inactive doses of <b>sufentanil,</b> the addition of clonidine results in activity; 3) In a particular dose-range of <b>sufentanil,</b> {{there is a direct}} relationship between the doses of <b>sufentanil</b> and clonidine needed to produce antinociception; 4) Even at very high doses of clonidine, a minimal amount of <b>sufentanil</b> is needed to produce antinociception and 5) At the conditions tested here, the contribution of clonidine is minimal at high, intrinsic active doses of <b>sufentanil...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} intraarticular <b>sufentanil</b> {{in the prevention of}} postoperative pain after day-case arthroscopic procedures. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to receive either intraarticular <b>sufentanil,</b> 5 or 10 microg, and saline IV, or intraarticular saline and <b>sufentanil</b> 5 microg IV (control). All study medication was administered in a double-blinded fashion. Postoperatively and the day after surgery, pain levels at rest and during movement (i. e., active flexion of the knee), measured by a visual analog scale, were significantly lower in the <b>Sufentanil</b> groups compared with the Control group. Moreover, intraarticular <b>sufentanil</b> significantly reduced the postoperative consumption of analgesics. The time until discharge from the postanesthesia care unit (assessed by the Aldrete score) was significantly shorter in the patients receiving <b>sufentanil</b> intraarticularly. There {{were no significant differences between}} the two <b>Sufentanil</b> groups either in the intensity of postoperative pain or in discharge times from the postanesthesia care unit. We conclude that intraarticular <b>sufentanil</b> in arthroscopic knee procedures is a simple, effective, safe and well-tolerated analgesic technique for outpatients undergoing arthroscopic procedures. Increasing the dose <b>sufentanil</b> from 5 to 10 microg intraarticularly offered no additional advantage. Intraarticular <b>sufentanil</b> (5 - 10 microg) administration improves postoperative management after day-case diagnostic arthroscopic knee procedures.

40|$|Background: Intrathecal <b>sufentanil</b> {{provides}} rapid-onset {{and complete}} analgesia {{for the first}} stage of labor, The dose required to produce this effect can be associated with maternal respiratory depression, hypotension, nausea, or pruritus. Because clonidine potentiates the analgesic effects of opioids without increasing their side effects, the authors wanted to determine the efficacy of low doses of intrathecal clonidine (15 and 30 mu g) combined with <b>sufentanil.</b> Methods: Ninety-eight parturient requesting labor analgesia were studied. In a combined spinal-epidural technique, patients mere randomly assigned to receive one of the following intrathecal solutions: either 15 mu g clonidine (n = 10); 30 mu g clonidine (n = 10); 2. 5 mu g <b>sufentanil</b> (n = 13); 5 mu g <b>sufentanil</b> (n = 13); 2. 5 mu g <b>sufentanil</b> and 15 mu g clonidine (n = 13); 2. 5 mu g <b>sufentanil</b> and 30 mu g clonidine (n = 13); 5 mu g <b>sufentanil</b> and 15 mu g clonidine (n = 13); or 5 mu g <b>sufentanil</b> and 30 mu g clonidine (n = 13). Visual analog scores for pain, blood pressure, heart rate, sensory levels, incidence of nausea and pruritus, and motor blockade, and maternal and cord blood concentrations of clonidine were recorded. Results: patients receiving 30 mu g intrathecal clonidine with 2. 5 or 5 mu g intrathecal <b>sufentanil</b> had significantly longer-lasting analgesia (145 +/- 36 and 145 +/- 43 min vs. 104 +/- 35 for those receiving 5 mu g intrathecal <b>sufentanil</b> alone).

40|$|<b>Sufentanil</b> is a {{synthetic}} mu-opioid receptor agonist frequently used in anesthesia and critically ill patients. To evaluate {{the effects of}} <b>sufentanil</b> on the inflammatory, neuroendocrine, and metabolic responses to endotoxin, we studied six dogs during saline infusion (control), during <b>sufentanil</b> infusion (1. 5 microg. kg- 1. h- 1), after endotoxin injection (1. 0 microg/kg iv), and during combined endotoxin and <b>sufentanil</b> administration. The rate of appearance of glucose was determined by infusion of [6, 6 - 2 H 2]glucose. <b>Sufentanil</b> depressed the endotoxin-induced increase in body temperature (36. 9 +/- 0. 3 vs. 40. 6 +/- 0. 5 degrees C, P < 0. 05). <b>Sufentanil</b> depressed the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) response to endotoxin by approximately 60 % (P < 0. 01) but increased the interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) response by approximately 70 % (P < 0. 01). <b>Sufentanil</b> per se induced a transient neuroendocrine activation. <b>Sufentanil</b> also increased plasma concentrations of insulin and catecholamines after endotoxin (P < 0. 05 vs. endotoxin alone) and increased plasma glucose levels by approximately 36 % (from 6. 1 +/- 0. 1 to 8. 3 +/- 0. 6 mmol/l, P < 0. 05 vs. endotoxin alone). Endotoxin stimulated glucose production transiently by 95 % (24. 2 +/- 3. 2 vs. control 12. 4 +/- 1. 0 micromol. kg- 1. min- 1, P < 0. 05). Paradoxically, <b>sufentanil</b> inhibited this endotoxin-induced stimulation of glucose production (P < 0. 05 vs. endotoxin alone). In conclusion, <b>sufentanil</b> modulates the response to intravenous endotoxin by dissociating the TNF and IL- 6 response, increasing insulin and catecholamine levels, and depressing the increase in glucose production.

40|$|Background: Propofol {{is used as}} an {{induction}} {{and maintenance}} agent for general anesthesia but it can cause adverse reactions like hyperlipidemia, growth of microorganisms, and pulmonary embolisms. Microemulsion propofol was developed to avoid these side effects but incidence and severity of pain on injection is higher than with lipid emulsion propofol. We aimed to compare the effects of <b>sufentanil</b> in analgesic doses for reducing the injection pain of microemulsion propofol. Methods: The candidates included eighty patients, 19 - 60 years old and ASA III. They were randomly classified into four groups and pretreated with normal saline, <b>sufentanil</b> 0. 1 μg/kg, 0. 2 μg/kg or 0. 3 μg/kg before injection of microemulsion propofol. Five minutes after receiving pretreatment drug, 2 mg/kg of microemulsion propofol was injected and VAS was recorded. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} in the incidence of injection pain among the groups. Severity of injection pain was significantly lower in the <b>sufentanil</b> 0. 3 μg/kg group than normal saline and <b>sufentanil</b> 0. 1 μg/ kg group. Significant differences in blood pressure and heart rate were observed in <b>sufentanil</b> groups only after endotracheal intubation.

The present study evaluates effec-tiveness of differentconeentrations of <b>Sufentanil</b> mixed in propofol for TI VAin laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Sixty adult patients of ASA physical status I or II (randomly divided into 3 groups of twenty each) undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included in this randomised control study. At induction, patients in all groups received i. v. bolus of <b>Sufentanil</b> 1 ìg kg- 1 and continuous infusion of 100 ìg kg- 1 min - 1.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of regional anaesthesia on post surgery opioid induced hyperalgesia in diabetic and non-diabetic mice. MethodsDiabetic and non-diabetic mice underwent plantar surgery. Levobupivacaine and <b>sufentanil</b> were used before surgery, for sciatic nerve block (regional anaesthesia) and analgesia, respectively. Diabetic and non-diabetic groups were each randomly assigned to three subgroups: control, no <b>sufentanil</b> and no levobupivacaine; <b>sufentanil</b> and no levobupivacaine; <b>sufentanil</b> and levobupivacaine. Three tests were used to assess pain behaviour: mechanical nociception; thermal nociception and guarding behaviours using a pain scale. ResultsSufentanil, alone or in combination with levobupivacaine, produced antinociceptive effects shortly after administration. Subsequently, <b>sufentanil</b> induced hyperalgesia in diabetic and non-diabetic mice. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia was enhanced in diabetic mice.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{postoperative}} analgesia and unwanted {{side effects of}} a single dose of a mixture of morphine and <b>sufentanil</b> administered extradurally with the effects produced by extradural injection of each opioid alone in 64 patients after Caesarean delivery. The patients were allocated randomly to receive morphine 4 mg (n = 21), <b>sufentanil</b> 50 μg (n = 22) or morphine 2 mg with <b>sufentanil</b> 25 μg (n = 21) via an extradural catheter in a double-blind design. Intensity of pain was measured using a linear visual analogue scale. Compared with the effect produced by morphine alone, the morphine-sufentanil combination produced more rapid onset of pain relief (19 (SD 5) min vs 79 (23) min for a 75 % reduction of pain; P < 0. 01), whereas the duration and quality of analgesia assessed during 12 h was similar for these two groups. In contrast, patients receiving <b>sufentanil</b> alone required significantly more supplementary analgesia 4 h after administration than with morphine alone or morphine combined with <b>sufentanil.</b> There were no significant changes in cardiorespiratory variables in any group. Side effects consisted mainly of pruritus and nausea and did not differ between groups, {{with the exception of}} early and transient dizziness which was observed only in patients given <b>sufentanil</b> either alone or in combination with morphine. We conclude that a single extradural injection of morphine and <b>sufentanil</b> combines the short onset time produced by <b>sufentanil</b> and the long duration of analgesia attributable to morphine, thus providing excellent and prolonged analgesia after Caesarean deliver...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Myoclonus {{is a major}} side-effect {{following}} etomidate injection requiring use {{of medical}} intervention. Material and Methods: In this double-blinded clinical trial, 50 consecutive patients, randomly received <b>sufentanil</b> 0. 2 μg/kg or midazolam 0. 015 mg/kg, 90 s before induction of anesthesia with etomidate (0. 3 mg/kg). Then, the patients were monitored for any myoclonic movements during anesthesia. Results: The incidence of myoclonus was 28 % in the <b>sufentanil</b> group and 84 % in the midazolam group. The frequency and intensity of myoclonus were significantly higher in the midazolam group, compared to the <b>sufentanil</b> group (P < 0. 001). Myoclonus duration in the <b>sufentanil</b> and midazolam groups were 5. 8 ± 13. 2 and 69 ± 47. 8 s, respectively (P < 0. 0010). Conclusion: The frequency, intensity and duration of myoclonus in the midazolam group, were significantly more prevalent than the <b>sufentanil</b> group...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the effect of the}} addition of somatostatin and trimetaphan to <b>sufentanil</b> 20 fig kg' 1 on the hormonal responses to cardiac surgery and compared the changes with a control group receiving <b>sufentanil</b> and sodium nitro-prusside. Eighteen patients undergoing elective valve replacement surgery were studied. Patients who received somatostatin and trimetaphan in addition to <b>sufentanil</b> had significantly smaller serum growth hormone and plasma g/ucagon concentrations compared with those who re-ceived <b>sufentanil</b> and sodium nitroprusside. The cortisol response to surgery was inhibited in both groups. There {{were no significant differences in}} catecholamine concentrations between the two groups. There was no effect of the additional inhibition of g/ucagon and growth hormone on circulating concentrations of glucose and lactate, but plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids increased significantly. Thus the addition of somatostatin increased the suppression of the hormonal response to cardiac surgery by <b>sufentanil...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{intravenous}} (IV) and caudal routes of administration of <b>sufentanil</b> for children undergoing orchidopexy and also to evaluate the effects on addition of caudal adrenaline and neostigmine. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients scheduled for orchidopexy were divided into the following groups: 1) Group IVSu received IV 0. 5 μg/kg <b>sufentanil</b> and caudal saline; 2) Group CSu received caudal 0. 5 μg/kg <b>sufentanil</b> and IV saline; 3) Group CSuAdr received caudal <b>sufentanil</b> plus adrenaline 5 μg/ml (1 : 200, 000) and IV saline; 4) Group CSuNeo received caudal <b>sufentanil</b> plus neostigmine, and IV saline; and 5) Group CSuNeoAdr received caudal <b>sufentanil</b> plus neostigmine plus adrenaline, and IV saline. Heart rate and mean blood pressure > 15 % was treated with increasing isoflurane concentration. Consumption of isoflurane, side effects, quality of sleep, time to first administration of analgesic, and number of doses of 24 -h rescue analgesic were recorded. Results: Groups were demographically similar. Isoflurane consumption showed the following association: Group IVSu = Group CSuNeo = Group CSuNeoAdr Group CSuNeo = Group CSuNeoAdr (P < 0. 005). Incidence of adverse effects was similar among groups. Conclusion: Caudal <b>sufentanil</b> alone was no better than when administered in the IV route, and would just be justified by the association of neostigmine, but not adrenaline. Neostigmine association resulted in better perioperative analgesia...|$|E
