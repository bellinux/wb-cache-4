40|$|The {{leaching}} {{behaviors of}} heavy metals from <b>semi-dry</b> <b>scrubber</b> (SDS) residues of {{municipal solid waste}} incineration (MSWI) plants are re-investigated. The most leachable heavy metals in <b>semi-dry</b> <b>scrubber</b> resi-dues from municipal solid waste incinerators are found to be chromium ions (Cr(III) and Cr(VI)), but neither lead nor cadmium. Both of the leachabilities of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in MSWI scrubber residue are a function of the CaO/Al 2 O 3 ratio of residues. The pH-dependent leaching behaviors are only observed in the case of Cr(III), but not for Cr(VI). Our results show that it is worth recycling SDS residues which possess a lower chemical composition ratio of CaO/Al 2 O 3, {{in order to reduce the}} potential risk of toxic leaching of chromium species...|$|E
40|$|Municipal Solid Waste {{incinerator}} residues {{produced in}} {{two types of}} facilities were exhaustively characterized: granulometry, mineralogy, chemical composition, leaching behavior, and elemental distribution {{as a function of}} particle size. Air Pollution Control (APC) residues coming from a <b>semi-dry</b> <b>scrubber</b> have shown higher solubility than fly ashes originating in an Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP), as well as higher contents in volatile metals (Cd, Hg). Different metal speciation and distribution as a function of particle size have been found in fly ashes (ESP residues) and APC residues. In APC residues, heavy metals (with the exception of Hg) show a parabolic distribution with maxima in the smallest and largest particles, following the same profile as soluble salts. Metal distribution for APC residues exhibits that metals generally are not associated with silicate aluminate matrix. Results show the effect of adding lime to APC residues in metal speciation and distribution. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMunicipal {{solid waste}} (MSW) flue gas {{residues}} require further treatment {{prior to disposal}} or reuse, and vitrification {{is one of the}} main solidification-stabilization processes. This paper investigates the high temperature behavior of MSW flue gas residues, performed in laboratory experiments up to 1400 °C, and coupled with thermogravimetric analyses, X-ray diffraction, chemical and electron microprobe analyses. Melting temperatures of electrostatic precipitator (ESP) ash are in the range of 1202 - 1272 °C, whereas <b>semi-dry</b> <b>scrubber</b> residues melt between 1900 and 2300 °C. The mean liquidus temperature of flue gas residues can be simply evaluated as a function of their CaO content, by using the CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 ternary diagram. For ESP ash, the liquidus phase is a Zn-rich aluminous spinel, followed by anorthite at 1225 °C, and melilite at 1190 °C. The total mass loss reaches 18 wt. % at 1300 °C. Moreover, 90 % of evaporation takes place below 1000 °C, linked to evaporation of C, Cl, S, Na, K, and of the toxic metals Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu. Due to the high partial pressure of chlorine during heating, chloride is the most probable form of evaporation for Cd, Pb, and Cu. However, most of Zn, Cr, Ni, Sb and Sn remain in the vitrified product...|$|E

40|$|The 10 MW Demonstration of the Gas Suspension Absorption (GSA) {{program is}} a {{government}} and industry co-funded technology development. The objective of the project is to demonstrate {{the performance of the}} GSA system in treating a 10 MW slipstream of flue gas resulting from the combustion of a high sulfur coal. This project involves design, fabrication, construction and testing of the GSA system. The Project Performance and Economics Report provides the nonproprietary information for the `` 10 MW Demonstration of the Gas Suspension Absorption (GSA) Project`` installed at Tennessee Valley Authority`s (TVA) Shawnee Power Station, Center for Emissions Research (CER) at Paducah, Kentucky. The program demonstrated that the GSA flue-gas-desulfurization (FGD) technology is capable of achieving high SO{sub 2 } removal efficiencies (greater than 90 %), while maintaining particulate emissions below the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), without any negative environmental impact (section 6). A 28 -day test demonstrated the reliability and operability of the GSA system during continuous operation. The test results and detailed discussions of the test data can be obtained from TVA`s Final Report (Appendix A). The Air Toxics Report (Appendix B), prepared by Energy and Environmental Research Corporation (EERC) characterizes air toxic emissions of selected hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from the GSA process. The results of this testing show that the GSA system can substantially reduce the emission of these HAP. With its lower capital costs and maintenance costs (section 7), as compared to conventional <b>semi-dry</b> <b>scrubbers,</b> the GSA technology commands a high potential for further commercialization in the United States.

It is being circulated for comments on its technical merit and policy itnpticati~n~. ii [...] This report summarizes results of a project to character & air toxic emissions of selected hazardous air pollutants (HAPS) from the AirPol Gas Suspension Absorption SO 2 control technology. This project was sponsored by AirPol Inc., the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). The GSA process utilizes a <b>semi-dry</b> lime <b>scrubber</b> for SO 2 and HCI removal. Most of the solids in the GSA reactor are removed from the flue gas and recycled into the reactor. The flue gas from the GSA reactor/cyclone is passed through a dust collector for final patticulate control. AirPol demonstrated the ptocess in a 10 MW pilot-scale plant utilizing a slipstream from a coal-fired utility boiler. The pilot plant consisted of the GSA reactor/cyclone. an ESP. and a small. 1 MW equivalent pulsed jet baghouse...|$|R
40|$|Incineration, one of {{the most}} {{effective}} methods used to treat solid wastes, reduces the volume of solid wastes significantly and enables recovery of thermal energy. However, during this waste treatment, a small amount of heavy metals can be present in the form of fly ash or vapor in the flue gas, becoming a threat to human health and other living organisms once emitted into the environment. This study focuses on the characteristics and behavior of elements contained in the combustion residues and their impact on various wastes at Taiwan's municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI). Three kinds of waste, municipal solid waste (MSW), industrial waste (IW). and biomass waste (BM), were analyzed to obtain their physical properties and elemental composition before incineration. The combustion residues were collected with a sampler at various locations such as the furnace bottom, a heat economizer, a <b>semi-dry</b> <b>Scrubber,</b> a bag-house filter and a gas stack. Twenty-one elements were determined to establish the actual mass fraction and to estimate the possible impact on the environment. Owing to its volatility, Cd was found ill high concentrations in bag-house filter ash. In addition, the mass fraction of Zn, As, Pb, Sb and V in bag-house filter ash was found greater than 20 % for the three kinds of wastes. Iron (Fe) content was found to be high in MSW, S, Cd, Ni, Pb and Sb content were high in IW and Se content was high in BW (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of a dioxin abatement programme undertaken in the municipal waste incineration plant of Montcada i Reixac (Barcelona, Spain) after the replacement of an obsolete air cleaning device by a new flue gas treatment system. A number of sampling campaigns were conducted with the aim of characterising stack gas emission levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) /polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and to evaluate initial specifications of dioxin stack gas emission values below 0. 1 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3. Preliminary results revealed levels between 44 and 111 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 when the gas-cleaning system consisted only of an old electrostatic precipitator (ESP). Decreased levels around 15 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 were observed when the <b>semi-dry</b> <b>scrubber</b> began to operate and the ESP was switched off. Again, remarkable dioxin removal was observed after the installation of the fabric filter and levels around 0. 3 – 0. 4 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 were soon achieved. Nevertheless, the limit of 0. 1 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 was reached by additional injection of activated carbon which helped to lower PCDD/PCDF levels to around 0. 036 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3. The results also demonstrated a significant change in the dioxin distribution present in combustion-derived materials (stack gas emission, bottom ash and solid waste from gas treatment). The major dioxin fraction was found in gaseous matrices before the flue gas control system was upgraded. After this step, the major dioxin fraction content was ob-served in solid waste from gas treatment...|$|E
40|$|Optimizing the {{operating}} parameters to minimize polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDD/F) emission {{is the common}} interest of the municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration industry. In this study, we investigated the distribution of tetra- to octa-CDD/F along the flue gas line in a full-scale reciprocating grate incinerator and evaluated the effects of temperature control and O- 2 level on PCDD/F formation. Six runs were laid out and all performed under sufficient burning conditions, in which the combustion efficiency of MSW was more than 99. 9 %. The total concentration of tetra- to octa-CDD/F measured at the boiler outlet showed an increasing tendency {{with the increase of}} boiler outlet temperature (TB) from 214 degrees C to 264 degrees C. When flue gas ran across the <b>semi-dry</b> <b>scrubber</b> and cyclone precipitator, in which the temperature varied from 264 degrees C to 162 degrees C, the concentrations of the lower chlorinated dioxins and furans were significantly raised, especially for the TCDF. Increasing 02 supply from 6. 0 % to 10. 5 % essentially led to a higher yield of tetra- to octa-PCDD/F, suggested that under sufficient burning conditions the lower O- 2 level was favorable for reducing PCDD/F formation and emission. The variation of O- 2 level did not give rise to a systematical change of PCDD/F homologue pattern. For all measurements, the isomer distributions of tetra- to hepta-PCDD/F were more or less the same, nearly independent of variations in {{the operating}} conditions and sampling positions. Only the significant increase of the sum of 1, 3, 7, 8 -TCDF and 1, 3, 7, 9 -TCDF was found in the zone after the boiler section. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWaste-to-energy (WTE) {{plants are}} {{utilized}} {{for the production}} of heat and electricity from municipal solid waste (MSW) and refused derived fuel (RDF). However, a desire to raise the steam temperature in order to improve the electrical efficiency of WTE plants has introduced potential high temperature corrosion problems to the heat transfer surface, due to high chlorine content (0. 5 wt. %∼ 1. 0 wt. %) in MSW. To study the corrosion mechanism and deposits chemistry, full scale investigations were therefore conducted in a WTE plant in Tianjin, China. Deposit and corrosion probes were inserted and exposed to the flue gas at five different locations. After nine months exposure, two different alloy probes were taken out and analyzed. Meanwhile, the chlorine flow in the waste incinerator was also investigated via stack sampling and analysis of the residue's composition. The results showed: the most significant outlet for chlorine flow is via fly ash, accounting for 40. 3 % of total chlorine. Other main distributions are approximate 6. 7 % in bottom ash, 31. 4 % in <b>semi-dry</b> <b>scrubber</b> and bag filter ash, 2. 75 % discharged from stacks and rest in the leachate. The chlorine content was 0. 92 % via back-calculation method, which kept consistence with the elemental analysis. The deposits on the probes showed similar but distinct characteristics: all deposits were rich in sulfur and calcium content, potassium decreasing with flue gas flow suddenly showed highest value at Evaporator. With the deposits growth, the deposits can be classified into outer, inner and interface. The sodium and sulfur contents were rich in interface; silicon and magnesium were rich in inner; and calcium and chlorine were very high in the outer...|$|E
