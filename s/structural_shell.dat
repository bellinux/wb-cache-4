40|$|January 27 th of this year, 2010, was the centenary of {{the birth}} of a famous {{architect}} of Spanish origin, Félix Candela, {{one of the most prominent}} players in modern architecture’s thin shell adventure. His international fame was based on precisely that, the construction of over 800 thin concrete shells characterized not only by their rationality and optimal strength, but also by their striking sculptural beauty. Architects such as Frei Otto, Ove Arup and David Billington justifiably called his work“structural art”. In addition analyzing Félix Candela’s contribution to modern architecture, the present article explores new lightweight structures as the ongoing pursuit of the optimization of structural form with different materials and technologies. That pursuit, both past and present, constitutes the focus of attention of the International Association for <b>Structural</b> <b>Shells,</b> IASS, founded by Eduardo Torroja in 1959 and fully operational today.

Then, once the school had identified its users, Omniplan was able to work directly with them to design an optimal interior, complete with a conference center and faculty and staff dining.

40|$|A {{large amount}} of the {{embedded}} energy of buildings is due to their structures. Consequently, designers have been developing lighter and material efficient structures. However, lightweight structures are vulnerable to aerial and structure-borne noise transmission, especially for the lower frequencies. Sound insulation from environmental noise or footfall is commonly addressed by increasing {{the mass of the}} structure, resulting in inefficient constructions. In the lower frequency range, structural stiffness plays a significant role in preventing sound transmission. This paper studies the relationship between stiffness and the acoustical insulation properties of shallow <b>structural</b> <b>shells.</b> The sound radiation of doubly curved shells, under point loads, is estimated by computing the surface normal velocity using Finite Element Method and the radiated sound power using the Rayleigh Integral.

Part I describes an algorithm for incompressible flow coupled with compressible elastic solids, while Part II discusses an algorithm for incompressible flow coupled with <b>structural</b> <b>shells.</b> Importantly, these new added-mass partitioned (AMP) schemes are stable and retain full accuracy with no sub-iterations per time step, {{even in the}} presence of strong added-mass effects (e. g. for light solids). The numerical approach described here for bulk compressible solids extends the scheme of Banks et al.

The basic AMP Robin conditions, involving a linear combination of velocity and stress, are determined from the outgoing solid characteristic relation normal to the fluid-solid interface combined with the matching conditions on the velocity and traction. Two alternative forms of the AMP conditions are then derived depending on whether the fluid equations are advanced with a fractional-step method or not. The stability and accuracy of the AMP algorithm is evaluated for linearized FSI model problems; the full nonlinear case being left for future consideration.
