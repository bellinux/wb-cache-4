40|$|Government {{mandated}} {{records management}} requirements apply to retention {{and long term}} archival {{of a wide variety}} of records. Part of the attention is on permanent accession and retention by the U. S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) but interim requirements for storage by the <b>source</b> <b>agency</b> are included. As government agencies and the Department of Defense move toward implementations, additional goals often include saving design data for reuse. This paper briefly reviews the government records management requirements then investigates candidate meanings of 'reuse' and proposes an enhanced design records retention approach. The recommended strategy that emerges is, for a given program or product family, to invest in rich and readily re-executable preservation of design artifacts for one or two subsequent generations, then downgrade the data in utility through conversions, ultimately reaching the NARA minimum standard for permanent historical-interest archives...|$|E
40|$|Optimization of mass microalgae {{cultures}} {{is required}} for the efficient production of biodiesel feedstock in terms of total fatty acid (TFA) content and a conducive fatty acid profile. A mutant strain of Nannochloropsis sp. (MT-I 5), as modified via random mutagenesis and flow cytometric cell sorting, was investigated in both a single- and two-stage cultivation using 250 �L laboratory raceway ponds. Culture was based on photoautotrophic biomass production (stage 1) followed by a switch to photomixotrophic growth induced by adding sodium acetate (2 �mM) (stage 2). The biomass yield of the mutant in two-stage cultivation was maintained at a level {{similar to that of the}} one-stage photoautotrophic culture, but TFA content was increased by 2. 3 -fold. The fatty acid profile of MT-I 5 also had an increased level of desirable saturated fatty acids (SFA) for use as a biodiesel feedstock, i. e. from 43 to 48 �% of TFA, as well as a decreased level of less desirable polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), i. e. from 22 to 7 �% of TFA. The two-stage cultivation process is of interest for the mass culture of microalgae for biofuel feedstocks, as biomass productivity can be maximized during the first stage of culture until N-starvation is achieved, followed by the enhanced synthesis of SFA in the second stage of culture by adding sodium acetate as a fixed-carbon <b>source.</b> <b>Agency</b> for Science, Technology and Research of Singapore (A*STAR) Scopu...|$|E
40|$|Based on Salkovskis’ {{cognitive}} model (Salkovskis & al., 2000), obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) {{are characterized by}} frequent intrusive thoughts and images of past events that are highly appraised in term of personal responsibility. Theoretically, this dysfunctional appraisal leads to different cognitive biases, beside others in memories processes. The current analogue study aims to examine, in a nonclinical sample of 46 young adults, the effect of responsibility beliefs on involuntary as well as voluntary memories {{of positive and negative}} events. In an incidental learning phase, participants were presented with 40 sentences describing either a positive or a negative event. The sentences were randomly presented in one out of the two responsibility conditions: “high” (i. e., “I wish that…”) versus “low” (i. e., “Somebody wishes that…”). In the test phase, different memory tasks were presented: an involuntary memory task, a free recall and a recognition task. Results indicated that an implicit encoding of positive and negative events promotes the occurrence of intrusions. Furthermore, our data indicated that self-engaging negative events were more accurately recalled than self-engaging positive events. We also found that negative and positive self-engaging situations were more accurately recognized than non self-engaging situations. As hypothesized, participants showed less confidence in memory when recalling and recognizing the <b>source</b> <b>agency</b> of negative self-engaging situations. In accordance to Salkovskis’ model of OCS, the current study suggests that memory of past events is substantially modulated by the appraisal of personal responsibility. The link between voluntary and involuntary memory, subjective responsibility and OCS will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|THISPAPER IS {{an attempt}} to {{describe}} {{the structure of the}} mechanisms and problems in the distribution and utilization of bibliographic data in US. libraries in the period from 1876 to 1945, or from the founding of the American Library Association to the close of the precomputer age. In this paper, a bibliographic system is defined as the compilation and nationwide dissemination of biblio-graphic information, either cooperatively or from a central <b>source</b> <b>agency,</b> to independent libraries. For the period under consideration it is appropriate to speak of the evolution rather than the develop-ment of such systems. The purpose of a national bibliographic system is obscured by the terminology of the times. In the voluminous literature on economy in cataloging, for example, librarians did not project a national biblio-graphic system but wrote in terms of specific topics. They wanted better catalogs with less expenditure of time and money and tended to omit stating the obvious-namely, that the savings would result in better service to library users. The system could release staff time and energy for more direct service to users or for expanded services. It would also provide higher quality bibliographic data, expand subject access to library materials, include more efficient access to a greater number of bibliographic entities, and furnish location information for a particular item needed but not available in the user’s local library. A comprehensive universal bibliographic system remains a dream of librarians. Two aspects of the system, bibliographic data from a central source and access to the item by interlibrary lending, had been part of Jewett’s dream for the Smithsonian Institution. His ill-fate...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{designed}} to document the analysis process and estimation models currently used by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to estimate the off-highway gasoline consumption and public sector fuel consumption. An overview of the entire FHWA attribution process is provided along with specifics related to the latest update (2008) on the Off-Highway Gasoline Use Model and the Public Use of Gasoline Model. The Off-Highway Gasoline Use Model {{is made up of}} five individual modules, one for each of the off-highway categories: agricultural, industrial and commercial, construction, aviation, and marine. This 2008 update of the off-highway models was the second major update (the first model update was conducted during 2002 - 2003) after they were originally developed in mid- 1990. The agricultural model methodology, specifically, underwent a significant revision because of changes in data availability since 2003. Some revision to the model was necessary due to removal of certain data elements used in the original estimation method. The revised agricultural model also made use of some newly available information, published by the data <b>source</b> <b>agency</b> in recent years. The other model methodologies were not drastically changed, though many data elements were updated to improve the accuracy of these models. Note that components in the Public Use of Gasoline Model were not updated in 2008. A major challenge in updating estimation methods applied by the public-use model is {{that they would have to}} rely on significant new data collection efforts. In addition, due to resource limitation, several components of the models (both off-highway and public-us models) that utilized regression modeling approaches were not recalibrated under the 2008 study. An investigation of the Environmental Protection Agency's NONROAD 2005 model was also carried out under the 2008 model update. Results generated from the NONROAD 2005 model were analyzed, examined, and compared, to the extent that is possible on the overall totals, to the current FHWA estimates. Because NONROAD 2005 model was designed for emission estimation purposes (i. e., not for measuring fuel consumption), it covers different equipment populations from those the FHWA models were based on. Thus, a direct comparison generally was not possible in most sectors. As a result, NONROAD 2005 data were not used in the 2008 update of the FHWA off-highway models. The quality of fuel use estimates directly affect the data quality in many tables published in the Highway Statistics. Although updates have been made to the Off-Highway Gasoline Use Model and the Public Use Gasoline Model, some challenges remain due to aging model equations and discontinuation of data sources...|$|E
