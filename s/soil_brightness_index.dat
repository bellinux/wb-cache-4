The samples were submitted to granulometric classification in sieve of 44 μm, magnetic separation in a magnetic induction of 14000 gauss, and chemical bleaching with sodium dithionite during 240 min. The processes were divided into two beneficiation routes. X-ray diffraction, chemical analysis by X-ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy were used for mineralogical characterization of the ore and measurement of the <b>brightness</b> <b>index,</b> while electron paramagnetic resonance was applied to study the variation of iron oxides and hydroxides during beneficiation.

For Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data, the Tasseled cap transform perform an orthogonal transformation of the original data into new four-dimensional space consisting of the <b>soil</b> <b>brightness</b> <b>index</b> (SBI), the green vegetation index (GVI), the yellow stuff/vegetation index (YVI) and non-such index (NSI) associated with atmospheric effects.

The Brightness and Greenness are equivalent to the MSS tasseled cap SBI and GVI, and the third component is related to soil features, including moisture status.

The alpine flora and ecological characters of Deosai Plateau, important environmental variables responsible for species distribution, life forms, chorology and vegetation structure, analysis on pasture conditions and trends, biomass productivity and carrying capacity were studied. Possible influences of grazing on alpine grasslands were also investigated. Key issues of pasture use have been incorporated in the study with a variety of recommendations. Vegetation sampling was carried out through line transect and quadrat method, covering major habitats and elevation ranges for measurement of species composition and their relationship with environmental variables. Hierarchical cluster analysis technique of Two Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) was used for vegetation classification in the first order. Relationship of alpine plant communities with environmental factors were studied through Ordination method of Deterrended Correspondence Analysis. One hundred and seventy five species, representing 111 genera and 37 families were found. Compositae and Ranunculaceae were the dominant families. Hemicryptophyte (71. 4 %) and chamaephyte (14. 9 %) were the dominant life forms of Deosai Plateau, suggesting the extreme weather conditions similar to arctic tundra. The flora was predominantly West Himalayan (31 %) and Himalayan (13 %), followed by Central Asian and Circumpolar elements (11 %). Six communities were differentiated on the basis of indicator species and justified in the ordination plots. Species diversity and richness were recorded highest in Carex-Agropyron-Koberesia community. The greatest dissimilarity was found between Artemisia-Polygonum-Thallictrum community and Agropyron- Festuca-Nepeta community with 95 % dissimilarity. Each plant community showed a marked dissimilarity from others with more than 55 % dissimilarity index. Senwai block showed highest diversity with a diversity index of 3. 7 and species richness of 58 with low evenness score. Grassland vegetation data showed a total variance("inertia") of 8. 58. Ordination axis; DCA 1 and DCA 2 accounted for a total of 12. 27 % of the variance, with DCA 1 explaining a high proportion (6. 72 %). Altitude and soil moisture had significant correlation with ordination axes. Elevation (ele), topographic wetness index (twi), cos-transformed aspect (aspv), <b>soil</b> <b>brightness</b> <b>index</b> (sbi) and slope were found significantly related with species turnover. Vegetation cover was higher on northern slopes at lower elevations in areas of relatively good soil moisture. The variables gvi, sbi, and twi had strong positive correlation, while savi, elevation and aspv had strong negative correlation with DCA 1. The soil moisture factor along axis 1 seems to be the decisive factor in vegetation distribution. gvi and slope variables showed strong negative relationship with DCA 2. Assessment of pasture conditions through hyper-temporal vegetation indices of NDVI image series showed an overall 8 - 10 % retrogression of vegetation in productive grasslands. Regressive trend at minor intensity was observed throughout the productive grasslands of DNP with the exception of HBB core zone. The average biomass production in DNP was found 1243 kg/ha suggesting that DNP is currently having low biomass productivity. The average carrying capacity was found as 1. 37 ha/A. U/ 3 months. Heavy influx of nomads with severe grazing problems, free grazing by peripheral communities mainly concentrated in north eastern parts with established permanent animal corals, extraction and unwise exploitation of fuelwood and medicinal plants although illegal under the law, unmanaged tourism, absence of incentives to buffer-zone communities and habitat fragmentation were identified as major issues of the park.

The conductivity agreed well with a value measured with an infiltration ring and the other parameters agreed with values in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Mapping {{and dating}} soil organic {{material}} {{is of great}} importance in soil use and evaluation. Yet the most common mapping method of these features is based on visual, qualitative interpretation of air-photos. In this study we examine the feasibility of mapping soil organic material content by using airborne hyperspectral reflective remote sensing methodology. This technique was tested in Henshan County located in north of Shanxi province. A correlation analysis was performed between soil organic material data and color <b>indices</b> (<b>brightness</b> <b>index,</b> coloration index, hue index, redness index and saturation index). Using these correlations {{we were able to}} build up the regression model, and map the soil organic material content by calculating each pixel of Hyperion image. The accuracy assessment (the overall accuracy estimated as 76 %) showed that the map is reliable and significantly correlated with known stabilization processes throughout the study area. The quantitative methodology developed in this study for mapping soil organic material can be adapted to other arid regions throughout the world. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{study of}} the effect of the air {{transmission}} through the fabric {{is an important factor in}} textile industries. Recent research trends suggest that a modeling and simulation technique to determine the quality and comfort of the fabric is still to be explored. Ahmet et al. (2005) have studied the concept of determining porosity in textile fabric using image analysis techniques. In this paper we have made an attempt to develop a Java and MATLAB based simulation software to determine <b>brightness</b> <b>index</b> using image analysis. The statistical models are also developed using regression techniques. The models are simulated through STATGRAPHICS software and the comparison with experimental results suggests that the results are in good agreement with the experimental matrix...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to assessing textile porosity by {{the application of the}} image analysis techniques. The images of different types of sample fabrics, taken through a microscope when the fabric is placed over a constant light source, transfer the problem into the image analysis domain. Indeed, porosity can thus be expressed in terms of a <b>brightness</b> percentage <b>index</b> calculated on the digital microscope image. Furthermore, it is meaningful to compare the <b>brightness</b> percentage <b>index</b> with the air permeability and the tightness indices of each fabric type. We have experimentally shown that there exists an approximately linear relation between brightness percentage and air permeability indices. Keywords—Textile fabrics, porosity, air permeability, image analysis, light transmission. I...|$|R
40|$|Noodle {{is one of}} {{the staple}} foods that are widely {{consumed}} and preferred by the Asian. However, wet noodles with modified cassava flour (mocaf) substitution resulted in lower quality compared to 100 % wheat noodle. Addition of a certain amount of konjac glucomannan (Amorphophallus oncophyllus flour) to wet noodle is strongly recommended {{due to the fact that}} the food additive has a health benefit. Porang or konjac flour, which was used in the research, has soluble fiber properties, low calorie content, and highly viscous. It forms a heat stable gel with a mild alkali, interacts with starch, and has a synergistic interaction with kappa carrageenan. In this research, konjac flour was added to study the optimum combination between konjac and water. As much as 2, 4 and 6 % (w/w) of konjac flour were combined with 35, 40, 45 % (v/w) of water. The results showed that treatments with combinations of konjac flour and water were significantly contributing to characteristics of cooking time, cooking loss, color <b>brightness</b> <b>index,</b> tensile strength, swelling volume and water absorption. The best treatment was at a combination of 4 % konjac (w/w) and 35 % water (v/w). The best porang noodles have the characteristics of cooking time at 2. 13 minutes, cooking loss of 35 %, tensile strength of 0. 14 N, water absorption of 201. 58 %, color <b>brightness</b> <b>index</b> of 51. 41, swelling volume of 103. 63 %, moisture content of 31. 77 %, protein content of 5. 87 %, fat content of 2. 13 %, ash content of 0. 85 % and crude dietary fiber of 4. 58 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{spectral}} {{behavior of}} a cotton canopy with four different soil types inserted underneath, respectively, was examined at various levels of vegetation density. Measured composite spectra, representing mixtures of vegetation with different soil backgrounds were compared with existing measures of greenness, including the NIR-Red band ratios, the perpendicular vegetation index and the green vegetation index. Observed spectral patterns involving constant vegetation amounts with different soil backgrounds could not be explained nor predicted by either the ratio or the orthogonal greenness measures. All greenness measures {{were found to be}} strongly dependent on <b>soil</b> <b>brightness.</b> Furthermore, soil-induced greenness changes became greater with increasing amounts of vegetation up to 60 % green cover. Three versions of factor analysis were subsequently utilized to determine if soil background influences could be filtered from canopy spectral data sets. In R-mode factor analysis, canopy spectra were decomposed into orthogonal features called brightness and greenness. The greenness feature, however, was found to be dependent, not only on vegetation density, but on soil background spectral properties. Of most concern were <b>soil</b> <b>brightness</b> influences which resulted in lowered greenness values with wet or dark soil backgrounds and identical vegetation conditions. The Q-mode version of factor analysis decomposed canopy spectra into additive, soil and vegetation, reflectance components. Although soil spectral response was found to contribute and mix into the derived greenness measure, significant improvements in vegetation discrimination occurred, especially at low vegetation densities. Finally, the T-mode version of factor analysis successfully separated the spectral influences of soil background from the larger response due to vegetation canopy development. Canopy spectra were decomposed into soil-dependent and soil-independent canopy components. The soil-dependent component was found to resemble the spectral response of green vegetation due to the scattering and transmittance properties of the overlying vegetation canopy. Results showed how the soil-dependent signal mixed into various measures of greenness and hampered vegetation discrimination. The filtering of soil background response from spectral data sets significantly improved greenness indices and vegetation analyses...|$|R
40|$|An {{airborne}} multispectral {{video system}} {{was used to}} collect soil spectral data over a four-square mile region in northeastern Arizona. Six multispectral video images were digitized. Using the red and blue bands of each image, an unsupervised classification was performed. Each was referenced to a digitized U. S. Soil Conservation Service map resulting in classification precisions ranging from 0 - 92. 4 percent. Ground radiometric measurements were made to ascertain spectral separability of the soil samples. Soil color was determined to try to relate Munsell value to classification precision. Misclassification of soil map units was unrelated to <b>soil</b> <b>brightness</b> or areal extent of each soil. Rather, features such as slope, boundary complexity, and surface condition was responsible for misclassifications seen in this study. Best classification results occurred when soil mapping units were relatively homogeneous, possessed slight changes in slope, and had a regular surface with smooth and distinct boundaries...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing {{archaeology}} bases {{on the use}} {{of remote}} sensing images and interpretation of the principles. The historic relics and sites are resulted from human activities and have constantly caused influences on the soil component, moisture content, temperature, vegetation growth and so on. Based on this thought, this paper proposed a new remote sensing model and approach that integrates optical and thermal infrared remote sensing data for archaeology. Taking the Qin Yongcheng site as the example, this method conducts a comprehensive analysis of key factors affecting archaeological application, that is, LST estimated with Landsat TM data, <b>soil</b> <b>brightness,</b> humidity and greenness obtained from GF- 1 data, and then interprets the potential site targets. By conducting the field verification, it is shown that the interpreted potential sites are well consisted with the field investigations and have a high interpretation precision. It can provide a guide for further archaeological research...|$|R
