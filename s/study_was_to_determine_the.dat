25|$|In 2015, Terry-McElarth {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a study in}} the American Journal of Preventative Medicine on regular soda policies and their effect on school beverage availability and student consumption. The purpose of the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of a program beginning in the 2014–2015 school year that requires schools participating in federally reimbursable meal programs to remove all competitive venues (a la carte cafeteria sales, vending machines, and stores/snack bars/carts), on the availability of unhealthy beverages at schools and student consumption. The study analyzed state- and school district-level policies mandating soda bans and found that state bans were associated with significantly lower school soda availability but district bans showed no significant associations. In addition, no significant correlation was observed between state policies and student consumption. Among student populations, state policy was directly associated with significantly lower school soda availability and indirectly associated with lower student consumption. The same was not observed for other student populations.|$|E
2500|$|According to a {{study in}} the Journal of Orthopaedics the {{prevalence}} of a rotator cuff tear was considerably greater in males than in females within the ages of 50–60 years old, within the ages of 70–80 years old there wasn’t much difference in prevalence. The data of this study showed that the prevalence of a rotator cuff tear in the general population is 22.1% [...] Yamamoto et al. performed a medical examination on 683 people whom live in a mountain village. The purpose of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> prevalence of a rotator cuff tear among a population. Yamamoto found that among the mountain village population, rotator cuff tears were present in 20.7% of the village population. In both of these studies we see that the percentages of the prevalence of a rotator cuff tear are very close in number so these numbers show us the prevalence of rotator cuff tears in the general population.|$|E
50|$|From 1964 to 1968, the U.S. Army paid $386,486 to professors Albert Kligman and Herbert W. Copelan {{to perform}} {{experiments}} with mind-altering drugs on 320 inmates of Holmesburg Prison. The {{goal of the}} <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> minimum effective dose of each drug needed to disable 50 percent of any given population. Kligman and Copelan initially claimed that they were unaware of any long-term health effects the drugs could have on prisoners; however, documents later revealed {{that this was not}} the case.|$|E

The primary efficacy objective of the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> effect of PBT2 on cognition as measured by a cognitive test battery consisting of Category Fluency Test, TMT Parts A and B, Map Search, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Stroop Word Reading Test, Speeded Tapping Task and MoCA. The results of these assessments were used to calculate three composite z-scores of cognition - the Main Composite z-score, Exploratory Composite z-score and Executive Function z-score.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> safety and effectiveness of injecting bone marrow stem cells into heart muscle {{in an attempt to}} promote blood vessel growth that could potentially improve the blood supply in hearts that are failing. This study recruited patients who had heart failure, but would no longer benefit from other forms of standard treatment such as surgery or coronary artery repair procedures such as balloon angioplasty or stent placement. The results of this study were presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Annual Meeting in 2012 and simultaneously published in JAMA.|$|E
5000|$|The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study {{examined}} the IQ test scores of 130 black or interracial children adopted by advantaged white families. The {{aim of the}} <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on IQ tests as compared to white children. The initial study was published in 1976 by Sandra Scarr and Richard A. Weinberg. A follow-up study was published in 1992 by Richard Weinberg, Sandra Scarr and Irwin D. Waldman. Another related study investigating social adjustment in a subsample of the adopted black children was published in 1996. One of the studies' findings was the IQs of adopted black children reared by white families {{did not differ significantly}} from that of black children raised by their biological parents.|$|E

5000|$|In 1987, {{the then}} Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Gration, tasked the then Brigadier Baker to: [...] conduct {{a study of}} the {{existing}} ADF command arrangements in order to recommend further development to meet likely requirements into the 21st century for both low and high levels of operations. [...] One of the principal aims of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> optimal command arrangements for ADF air power. The final report, commonly referred to as the Baker Report, was published in March 1988. Despite extensive reference being made to the command and control challenges posed by air power, Baker did not provide definitive guidance on how the ADF should structure its command arrangements to optimise the development and employment of air power. However, Chapter 7 of the report strongly advocated the creation of NORCOM, a recommendation that was soon adopted by the ADF.|$|E
