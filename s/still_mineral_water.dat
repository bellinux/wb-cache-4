40|$|In {{case of a}} {{deliberate}} contamination {{of the food chain}} with brucellae {{it is important to know}} the survival of the bacteria in relevant food matrices. Therefore, the survival of Brucella abortus 1119 - 3 was investigated in raw milk as well as in commercially available foods like UHT-milk, certified raw milk, yogurt and <b>still</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> at general storage conditions. B. abortus 1119 - 3 and B. melitensis 16 M survived longest in UHT-milk in which the total cell count multiplied to more than 10 ^ 8 cfu/ml at the end of the product’s shelf life after 88 days. In <b>still</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> viable cells of B. abortus 1119 - 3 could be detected for 60 days in culture. Until this day the total cell count declined continuously. In raw milk and certified raw milk this strain survived until the end of the product’s shelf life (four days, respectively). In yogurt viable cells could be detected for two days (1. 5 % fat), four days (3. 5 % fat) or one day (10. 0 % fat), most probably due to the low pH of 4. 2. In case of {{a deliberate}} contamination brucellae would survive at a high concentration for two weeks (<b>still</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water)</b> or for months (UHT-milk) so that ingestion of the food would most probably lead to brucellosis. Suitable methods for the fast detection and typing of brucellae should be available in case of deliberate contamination of foods. Therefore, six different methods used in combination with PCR were examined regarding their efficiency to extract and detect Brucella-DNA from relevant food matrices. For extraction from <b>still</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> and physiological saline, the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) revealed the best detection limit of 5 x 10 ^ 1 cfu/ml. For raw milk both the kit and the phenol chloroform extraction were best suited of which the latter was more reliable at a detection limit of 5 x 10 ^ 1 cfu/ml. The detection limit for brucellae in yogurt (10 % fat) was better with phenol chloroform extraction (1 x 10 ^ 2 cfu/ml) than with QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (1 x 10 ^ 4 cfu/ml). By means of phenol chloroform extraction which is most suitable for milk products, the detection limit for Brucella DNA in camembert and goat cheese corresponded with 5 x 10 ^ 2 cfu/g. The extraction of DNA from soft cheese requires a homogenisation after dilution in a fluid which diminishes sensitivity. In contrast to cultivation of brucellae on nutrient agar for several days under biosafety level 3 conditions, the detection by using DNA extraction followed by real-time PCR can be achieved within half a working day (QIAamp DNA Mini Kit) or alternatively within one day (phenol chloroform extraction) under biosafety level 2 conditions. However, the limit for detection of Brucella DNA could not be improved by use of real-time PCR compared to the classical PCR. In order to optimize the detection limits for Brucella DNA especially in milk products, the immunomagnetic separation (IMS) was tested as a pre-enrichment and purification procedure. For this purpose, tosyl activated immunomagnetic particles coated with brucellosis serum or with a monoclonal anti-Brucella antibody were used. Despite the optimization of IMS considering different parameters such as sample volume, incubation time and temperature, the limit for the detection of Brucella DNA was 5 x 10 ^ 3 cfu/g for goat cheese, 1 x 10 ^ 3 cfu/ml for raw milk and <b>still</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water,</b> 8 x 10 ^ 4 cfu/ml for yogurt and 5 x 10 ^ 4 cfu/g for camembert and was thus less sensitive than DNA extraction methods mentioned above...|$|E

40|$|When weather {{conditions}} are damp, barley crops can be infected by fungi that produce amphiphilic proteins called hydrophobins. We postulated that these hydrophobins contaminate CO 2 bubbles during beer carbonation or shaking. These molecules prevent the dissolution or redissolution of CO 2 and, thus, stabilize CO 2 bubbles. These bubbles contain energy (overpressure) that is released when the beverage container is opened, causing the simultaneous nucleation of many bubbles, {{which leads to}} primary gushing. In this paper, we present validation of our hypothesis and show that dynamic light scattering (DLS) {{can be used as}} a tool to study the primary gushing phenomenon. The results indicate that both hydrophobins and CO 2 are necessary to induce gushing. Indeed, addition of a crude mycelium extract containing hydrophobin HFBI to different beverages such as beer, soda, and sparkling water led to gushing, whereas addition to <b>still</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> did not. Comparison of a commercial gushing and nongushing beer using DLS revealed the presence of particles with a diameter of approx. 100 nm in the gushing beer. According to our hypothesis, these 100 -nm particles should be nanobubbles stabilized by hydrophobin assemblages. The presence of these particles was also observed in all gushing beverages obtained after addition of the hydrophobin- containing mycelium extract. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Recent health {{promotion}} campaigns have encouraged {{the public to}} consume at least five portions of fruit and vegetables per day. Many see consuming fruit smoothies {{as a way of}} achieving this. Objective To ascertain the potential or otherwise for fruit smoothies to bring about dental erosion. Design Laboratory study. Method This was an in vitro investigation in which five varieties of shop bought fruit smoothies, including a 'thickie' were investigated, with respect to their initial pH, titratable acidity and effect upon exposure to the surface microhardness and profile of extracted human teeth. In addition their performance was compared to negative (Volvic™ water) and positive (orange juice) control drinks as well as a homemade smoothie, based upon the recipe of one of the commercially bought drinks, from which ingredient omissions were made. Results The majority of the drinks investigated had a baseline pH below the critical pH of enamel (5. 5) and required comparable volumes of 0. 1 M NaOH to raise their pH to neutrality as the positive control. Only two drinks (Volvic™ <b>still</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water,</b> the negative control, and the yoghurt, vanilla bean and honey 'thickie') displayed a higher pH, though to neutralise the thickie, a lesser quantity of alkali addition was required. The immersion of the tooth samples in the drinks brought about reductions in their surface hardness (expressed as a percentage change of median hardness) but these were only significant (p < 0. 001) for the cranberry, blueberry and cherry fruit smoothie and homemade strawberry and banana fruit smoothie. There was no reduction in surface hardness {{in the case of the}} teeth immersed in the thickie. Omission of certain ingredients from the homemade smoothie affected the magnitude of surface hardness reductions seen. With regard to the loss of surface contour of the tooth samples following immersion in the drinks, as assessed by depth loss, there were significant differences between the drinks (p = 0. 0064) with the thickie and negative control not causing depth loss and the kiwi, apple and lime smoothie producing most depth loss (28. 26 (5. 45) μm). Conclusions Within the limitations of this study some fruit smoothies have the potential to bring about dental erosion if consumed irresponsibly. This can be influenced by ingredient variations. In order to minimise the risk of developing dental erosion, without removing the claimed nutritional benefits of their consumption, their consumption should be confined to mealtimes...|$|E

After treatment, the samples were analysed using gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to detect volatile and non-volatile compounds, the Microtox test to evaluate potential toxicity of the samples, and three mutagenicity tests – Tradescantia and Allium cepa micronucleus tests and the Comet assay on human leukocytes – to detect their genotoxic activity. GC/MS analysis did not detect phthalates or acetaldehyde in the water samples. The Microtox test found no toxic effects. Mutagenicity tests detected genotoxic properties of some samples in both PET and glass bottles. Statistical analyses showed a positive association between mineral content and mutagenicity (micronuclei in A. cepa and DNA damage in human leukocytes). No clear effect of treatment and PET bottle was found. These results suggest the absence of toxic compounds migrating from PET regardless of time and conditions of storage.

In this work, {{the capability of}} a potentiometric electronic tongue, comprised with lipid polymeric membranes, to quantitatively estimate routinely quality physicochemical parameters (pH and conductivity) {{as well as to}} qualitatively classify water samples according to the type of water was evaluated. The study showed that a linear discriminant model, based on 21 sensors selected by the simulated annealing algorithm, could correctly classify 100 % of the water samples (leave-one out cross-validation). This potential was further demonstrated by applying a repeated K-fold cross-validation (guaranteeing that at least 15 % of independent samples were only used for internal-validation) for which 96 % of correct classifications were attained. The satisfactory recognition performance of the E-tongue could be attributed to the pH, conductivity, sugars and organic acids contents of the studied waters, which turned out in significant differences of sweetness perception indexes and total acid flavor. Moreover, the E-tongue combined with multivariate linear regression models, based on sub-sets of sensors selected by the simulated annealing algorithm, could accurately estimate waters pH (25 sensors: R 2 equal to 0. 99 and 0. 97 for leave-one-out or repeated K-folds cross-validation) and conductivity (23 sensors: R 2 equal to 0. 997 and 0. 99 for leave-one-out or repeated K-folds cross-validation).
