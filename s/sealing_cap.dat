40|$|The {{resonant}} {{shells of}} vibratory cylinder gyroscopes are commonly packaged in metallic caps. In order {{to lower the}} production cost, a portion of vibratory cylinder gyroscopes do not employ vacuum packaging. However, under non-vacuum packaging conditions there can be internal acoustic noise leading to considerable acoustic pressure which is exerted on the resonant shell. Based on {{the theory of the}} structural-acoustic coupling, the dynamical behavior of the resonant shell under acoustic pressure is presented in this paper. A finite element (FE) model is introduced to quantitatively analyze the effect of the structural-acoustic coupling. Several main factors, such as <b>sealing</b> <b>cap</b> sizes and degree of vacuum which directly affect the vibration of the resonant shell, are studied. The results indicate that the vibration amplitude and the operating frequency of the resonant shell will be changed when the effect of structural-acoustic coupling is taken into account. In addition, an experiment was set up to study the effect of structural-acoustic coupling on the sensitivity of the gyroscope. A 32. 4 mV/°/s increase of the scale factor and a 6. 2 Hz variation of the operating frequency were observed when the radial gap size between the resonant shell and the <b>sealing</b> <b>cap</b> was changed from 0. 5 mm to 20 mm...|$|E

The sterile catheter is threaded through the nozzle (with knurled screw) A, and the rubber sleeve B. Rotation of the nozzle now compresses the rubber sleeve, thus attaching the chuck firmly to the catheter as shown in the illustration.

In this study, a 3 D numerical model was developed for the investigation. Detailed processes for the storage capacity estimation are derived. The impact of injection strategy and the residual gas saturation on storage capacity was investigated. It is shown that both of the injection strategy and the residual gas saturation have a great impact on the spatial distribution of CO 2 plume and the effective storage of CO 2 in the reservoir. Simulation results also indicate that the injection well distribution may significantly influence the use of the formation porous space for CO 2 storage.

40|$|Geological {{storage of}} {{anthropogenic}} CO 2 emissions in deep saline aquifers has recently received tremendous {{attention in the}} scientific literature. Injected CO 2 plume buoyantly accumulates at the top part of the deep aquifer under a <b>sealing</b> <b>cap</b> rock, and some concern that the high-pressure CO 2 could breach the seal rock. However, CO 2 will diffuse into the brine underneath and generate a slightly denser fluid that may induce instability and convective mixing. Onset times of instability and convective mixing performance depend on the physical properties of the rock and fluids, such as permeability and density contrast. The novel idea is to adding nanoparticles to the injected CO 2 to increase density contrast between the CO 2 -rich brine and the underlying resident brine and, consequently, decrease onset time of instability and increase convective mixing. As far as it goes, only few works address the issues related to mathematical and numerical modeling aspects of the nanoparticles transport phenomena in CO 2 storages. In the current work, we will present mathematical models to describe the nanoparticles transport carried by injected CO 2 in porous media. Buoyancy and capillary forces as well as Brownian diffusion are important {{to be considered in}} the model.

Study design: Five threaded and impacted implants with four types of surfaces were inserted in an adult pig rib: two implants with a hydroxyapatite surface (HA) (impacted and threaded, respectively), a machined titanium surface implant (TI mach), a titanium plasma spray surface implant (TPS), and a sandblasted, acid-etched surface implant (SBAE). A 0. 5 -mm diameter bone defect {{was made in the}} implant apical zone, and a type-K thermocouple (Termopar) ® was placed in contact with the implant. The implants were irradiated in the coronal zone of each implant with a CO 2 (4 W continuous mode) and an ErCr:YSGG laser (1. 5 W, pulsed mode) first without and then with refrigeration. The temperature variations at the implant apical surface were recorded. Results: An apical temperature increase was recorded in all cases during CO 2 and ErCr:YSGG laser irradiation without refrigeration. However, when the ErCr:YSGG was used with a water spray, a decrease in temperature was observed in all implants. The acid-etched and sandblasted surfaces were those most affected by the thermal changes.

We evaluated the CO 2 storage capacity for a simplified reservoir system, which the layered potential storage formations are overlaid by <b>sealing</b> <b>cap</b> rock. In this paper, we aim to investigate numerically the storage of CO 2 at supercritical conditions in deep saline aquifer reservoirs.

Spatio-temporal variations of different state variables such as pressure, velocity, temperature and concentration were numerically simulated and plotted versus different controlling parameters particularly, thermal and solutal Rayleigh numbers and Lewis number.

40|$|Saline {{formations}} {{are considered}} to be candidates for carbon sequestration due to their great depths, large storage volumes, and widespread occurrence. However, injecting carbon dioxide into low-permeability reservoirs is challenging. An active demonstration project for carbon dioxide sequestration in the Ordos Basin, China, began in 2010. The site is characterized by a deep, multi-layered saline reservoir with permeability mostly below 1. 0 × 10 - 14 m 2. Field observations so far suggest that only small-to-moderate pressure buildup has taken place due to injection. The Triassic Liujiagou sandstone {{at the top of the}} reservoir has surprisingly high injectivity and accepts approximately 80 % of the injected mass at the site. Based on these key observations, a three-dimensional numerical model was developed and applied, to predict the plume dynamics and pressure propagation, and in the assessment of storage safety. The model is assembled with the most recent data and the simulations are calibrated to the latest available observations. The model explains most of the observed phenomena at the site. With the current operation scheme, the CO 2 plume at the uppermost reservoir would reach a lateral distance of 658 m by the end of the project in 2015, and approximately 1, 000 m after 100 years since injection. The resulting pressure buildup in the reservoir was below 5 MPa, far below the threshold to cause fracturing of the <b>sealing</b> <b>cap</b> (around 33 MPa) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{minimally}} invasive surgery, force feed-back information on tissue manipulation is altered by {{friction between the}} instrument and the sealing mecha-nism of the trocar. It is unknown how the different sealing mechanisms of currently available trocars influ-ence the friction forces. The current study investigated the dynamic changes in friction for various trocars at different instrument velocities. Methods: The friction characteristics for six common types of trocars were determined. A force sensor {{was attached to the}} shaft of a standard 5 -mm disposable grasper to measure the forces required to move it through the trocars. Movement velocity and direction of the shaft were controlled by a servomotor. In addition, whether moistening the shaft reduced friction was tes-ted. Results: The friction depended on the type of trocar, the movement velocity, and the movement direction, and varied between 0. 25 and 3. 0 N. Specifically, trocars with narrow sealing caps (i. e., high normal force onto the shaft) and trocars with thick sealing caps (i. e., large contact area) generate a high amount of friction. Moistening the shaft reduced friction 15 % to 45 %. For most trocars, large fluctuations in forces occur when the movement starts or when the direction reverses. The magnitude of these fluctuations varied between 0. 2 and 2. 5 N. Conclusions: For some trocars, friction can be as great as the forces associated with instrument–tissue interac-tion. At movement reversals, friction fluctuates due to deformations of the rubber and silicon parts of the sealing mechanism. Such high variance can deteriorate surgical performance during high precision tasks (e. g., tissue manipulation) that typically involve many chan-ges in movement direction. Comparisons of the inves-tigated trocars indicate that the friction magnitude and variance can be reduced easily by changing the proper-ties of the <b>sealing</b> <b>cap</b> or by lubricating the instruments...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{viability}} of {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) {{to reduce emissions}} of greenhouse gases depends on the ability to safely sequester large quantities of CO 2 over geologic time scales. One concern with CCS is the potential for induced seismicity. We report on ongoing seismic monitoring by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) at a CCS demonstration site in Decatur, IL, in an effort to understand the potential hazards posed by injection-induced seismicity associated with geologic CO 2 sequestration. At Decatur, super-critical CO 2 is injected at 2. 1 km depth into the Mt. Simon Sandstone, which directly overlies granitic basement. The primary <b>sealing</b> <b>cap</b> is the Eau Claire Shale at a depth of about 1. 5 km. The USGS seismic network was installed starting in July 2013 and consists of 12 stations, three of which include borehole sensors at depths of 150 m. The aperture of this network is about 8 km, centered on the injection well. We derived a one-dimensional velocity model from a vertical seismic profile acquired by Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and the Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS) to a depth of 2. 2 km, tied into acoustic logs from a deep observation well and the USGS borehole stations. We assume a constant ratio of P- to S-wave velocities of 1. 83, as derived from simultaneous earthquake relocations and velocity inversions. We use this velocity model to locate seismic events, all of which are within the footprint of our network. Moment magnitudes of events located to date range from - 1. 52 to 1. 07. We further improved the hypocentral precision of microseismic events when travel times and waveforms are sufficiently similar by employing double-difference relocation techniques, with relative location errors less than 80 m horizontally and 100 m vertically. Relocated seismicity tends to group in three distinct clusters: ∼ 0. 4 to 1. 0 km NE, 1. 8 to 2. 3 km N, and ∼ 2. 0 to 2. 6 km WNW from the injection well. The first cluster of microseismicity forms a roughly linear trend, which may represent a pre-existing geologic structure. Most of these micro-earthquakes occur in the granitic basement at depths greater than 2. 2 km, well below the caprock, and likely do not compromise the integrity of the seal...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of the GéoCarbone-PICOREF project was to select and characterize geological sites where CO 2 storage in permeable reservoir could be tested at the pilot scale. Both options of storage in deep saline aquifer and in depleted hydrocarbon field were considered. The typical size envisioned for the pilot was 100 kt CO 2 per year. GéoCarbone-PICOREF initially focused on a "Regional Domain", ca. 200 × 150 km, in the Paris Basin. It was attractive for the following reasons: - detailed geological data is available, due to 50 years of petroleum exploration; - basin-scale deep saline aquifers are present, with a preliminary estimate of storage capacity {{which is at the}} Gt CO 2 level, namely the carbonate Oolithe Blanche Formation, of Middle Jurassic age, generally located between 1500 and 1800 m depths in the studied area, and several sandstone formations of Triassic age, located between 2000 and 3000 m; - several depleted oil fields exist: although offering storage capacities at a much lower level, they do represent very well constrained geological environments, with proven sealing properties; - several sources of pure CO 2 were identified in the area, at a flow rate compatible with the pilot size, that would avoid capture costs. 750 km of seismic lines were reprocessed and organized in six sections fitted on well logs. This first dataset provided improved representations of: - the gross features of the considered aquifers in the Regional Domain; - the structural scheme; - lateral continuity of the <b>sealing</b> <b>cap</b> rocks. An inventory of the environmental characteristics was also made, including human occupancy, protected areas, water resource, natural hazards, potential conflicts of use with other resources of the subsurface, etc. From all these criteria, a more restricted geographical domain named the "Sector", ca. 70 × 70 km, was chosen, the most appropriate for further selection of storage site(s). The geological characterization of the Sector has been as exhaustive as possible, with the reprocessing of additional 450 km of seismic lines, and the collection of a complete well-data base (146 petroleum wells). At this scale a relatively detailed characterization of the sedimentary layers could be done, in particular the formations potentially rich in aquifer units. For the Middle Jurassic carbonates observations were made on analogue sediments outcropping 150 km to the east of the Sector. A geological and numerical 3 -D representation of the whole sedimentary pile of the Sector area was built. It forms a basis for constructing grids used by codes able to simulate various processes induced by CO 2 injection (displacement of the fluids, pressure build-up and release, mechanical deformation, mineral interactions, control of the parameters used to check the local sealing efficiency, etc.). In parallel with that work on aquifers, GéoCarbone-PICOREF has access to all the petroleum data, including production data and reservoir modelling, of the Saint-Martin de Bossenay oil field, localized {{in the eastern part of}} the Sector. This was an opportunity to apply a comparable methodology and to test the capabilities of modelling codes to the specific case of a depleted hydrocarbon field, and to show some of the advantages of such a context with respect to a pilot-scale CO 2 injectio...|$|E
