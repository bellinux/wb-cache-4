It {{includes}} the Patimokkha, {{a set of}} 227 offences including 75 rules of decorum for monks, along with penalties for transgression, in the Theravadin tradition. The precise content of the Vinaya Pitaka (scriptures on the Vinaya) differs in different schools and tradition, and different monasteries set their own standards on its implementation. The list of pattimokkha is recited every fortnight in a ritual gathering of all monks. Buddhist text with vinaya rules for monasteries have been traced in all Buddhist traditions, with the oldest surviving being the ancient Chinese translations.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 Gábor Tokai {{published}} {{a series of}} three short articles in the Hungarian popular science weekly, Élet és Tudomány. Tokai tries to date the codex by finding historical analogies of the imagery of the drawings. Although he brings up numerous valuable observations, his conclusions are somewhat vague. Nevertheless, his research was the first of its kind. Tokai could not rule out the possibility of a hoax, but he (like Locsmándi) insisted that whatever be the case, the text has regularities that strongly suggest a meaning. Several months later Tokai also published two similarly short articles in which he started to give meaning to <b>specific</b> <b>code</b> chunks. He based his arguments mainly on character strings that appear in pictures (such as the INRI inscription on the cross). His statements are sometimes too hypothetical. However, he claimed to have identified the codes of the four evangelists in biblical references, built up of an evangelist's name and a number, possibly some kind of chapter number. Based on Gyürk's and Locsmándi's work he also showed that many of the four digit numbers in the text are year numbers, using presumably a peculiar Anno Mundi epoch.|$|E

In relation to Opera Software's announcement earlier in the year that it would switch to WebKit by means of the Chromium codebase, it was confirmed that the Opera web browser would also switch to Blink.

40|$|The {{study is}} part of a broader {{research}} which intended at understanding the relation between students disruptive behaviours and teachers pedagogic practices and finding out reasons underlying that relation. Theoretically it is based on Bernsteins theory of pedagogic discourse. The study is centred on four students, from two science classes of the 6 th year of schooling (ages 11 - 12), who had showed distinct behaviours. It adresses the following objectives: (1) analyse students behaviours in terms of the interaction between their socio-affective dispositions and their <b>specific</b> <b>coding</b> orientation for power and control relations that characterise the regulative context of teachers pedagogic practices; (2) analyse the extent to which specificities of the interaction may explain different levels of disruptive behaviours. The study suggests that disruptive behaviours in the classroom are the result of the interaction between students socio-affective dispositions to teachers pedagogic practices and their <b>specific</b> <b>coding</b> orientation to control relations that characterise the regulative context of those practices. It also suggests that distinct <b>specific</b> <b>coding</b> orientations to power relations between teacher and students may explain distinct levels of disruptive behaviours...|$|R
