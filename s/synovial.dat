5|$|Angular motions occur over <b>synovial</b> {{joints and}} {{causes them to}} either {{increase}} or decrease angles between bones.|$|E
5|$|Gout may be {{diagnosed}} and treated without further investigations in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic acute arthritis {{of the base}} of the great toe (known as podagra). <b>Synovial</b> fluid analysis should be done, however, if the diagnosis is in doubt. X-rays, while useful for identifying chronic gout, have little utility in acute attacks.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a <b>synovial</b> fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. Other conditions that can look similar include pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.|$|E
5|$|While the arthroscopic {{classification}} of bone and cartilage lesions is considered standard, the Anderson MRI staging {{is the main}} form of staging used in this article. StagesI and II are stable lesions. StagesIII and IV describe unstable lesions in which a lesion of the cartilage has allowed <b>synovial</b> fluid between the fragment and bone.|$|E
5|$|In human anatomy, a bursa {{is a small}} pouch {{filled with}} <b>synovial</b> fluid. Its purpose is to reduce {{friction}} between adjacent structures. The prepatellar bursa {{is one of several}} bursae of the knee joint, and is located between the patella and the skin. Prepatellar bursitis is an inflammation of this bursa. Bursae are readily inflamed when irritated, as their walls are very thin. Along with the pes anserine bursa, the prepatellar bursa {{is one of the most}} common bursae to cause knee pain when inflamed.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{is vital}} for minimizing wear on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant {{may be used to}} reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating <b>synovial</b> fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E
5|$|The mainstays of {{treatment}} are removal {{from the source}} of lead and, {{for people who have}} significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part {{of treatment}} for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Lead-containing bullets and shrapnel may also present a threat of further exposure and may need to be surgically removed if they are in or near fluid-filled or <b>synovial</b> spaces. If lead encephalopathy is present, anticonvulsants may be given to control seizures, and treatments to control swelling of the brain include corticosteroids and mannitol. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for people with high blood lead concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Abelisaurids, {{especially}} Majungasaurus, may instead {{have been}} adapted for a feeding strategy {{more similar to}} modern felids, with short and broad snouts, that bite once and hold on until the prey is subdued. Majungasaurus had an even broader snout than other abelisaurids, {{and other aspects of}} its anatomy may also support the bite-and-hold hypothesis. The neck was strengthened, with robust vertebrae, interlocking ribs and ossified tendons, as well as reinforced muscle attachment sites on the vertebrae and the back of the skull. These muscles {{would have been able to}} hold the head steady despite the struggles of its prey. Abelisaurid skulls were also strengthened in many areas by bone mineralized out of the skin, creating the characteristic rough texture of the bones. This is particularly true of Majungasaurus, where the nasal bones were fused and thickened for strength. On the other hand, the lower jaw of Majungasaurus sported a large fenestra (opening) on each side, as seen in other ceratosaurs, as well as <b>synovial</b> joints between certain bones that allowed a high degree of flexibility in the lower jaw, although not to the extent seen in snakes. This may have been an adaptation to prevent the fracture of the lower jaw when holding onto a struggling prey animal. The front teeth of the upper jaw were more robust than the rest, to provide an anchor point for the bite, while the low crown height of Majungasaurus teeth prevented them from breaking off during a struggle. Finally, unlike the teeth of Allosaurus and most other theropods, which were curved on both the front and back, abelisaurids like Majungasaurus had teeth curved on the front edge but straighter on the back (cutting) edge. This structure may have served to prevent slicing, and instead holding the teeth in place when biting.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{feature of}} the {{temporomandibular}} joint is the articular disc. The disc is composed of dense fibrous connective tissue that is positioned between the two bones that form the joint. The temporomandibular joints {{are one of the}} few <b>synovial</b> joints in the human body with an articular disc, another being the sternoclavicular joint. The disc divides each joint into two.These two compartments are <b>synovial</b> cavities, which consists of an upper and a lower <b>synovial</b> cavity. The <b>synovial</b> membrane lining the joint capsule produces the <b>synovial</b> fluid that fills these cavities.|$|E
25|$|Joints, {{especially}} <b>synovial</b> joints {{allow the}} body a tremendous range of movements. Each movement at a <b>synovial</b> joint {{results from the}} contraction or relaxation of the muscles that {{are attached to the}} bones {{on either side of the}} articulation. The type of movement that can be produced at a <b>synovial</b> joint is determined by its structural type.|$|E
25|$|The <b>synovial</b> {{membrane}} is {{a continuation}} of that of the intercarpal joints. Occasionally, the joint between the hamate and the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones has a separate <b>synovial</b> membrane.|$|E
25|$|Actor Robert Urich {{died from}} <b>synovial</b> sarcoma.|$|E
25|$|Movement is {{not limited}} to only <b>synovial</b> joints, {{although}} they allow for most freedom. Muscles also run over symphysis, which allow for movement in for example the vertebral column by compression of the intervertebral discs. Additionally, <b>synovial</b> joints can be divided into different types, depending on their axis of movement.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally {{the fourth}} and fifth carpometacarpal joints have a {{separate}} <b>synovial</b> membrane.|$|E
25|$|Professional wrestler, Zack Ryder {{revealed}} {{he suffered}} from <b>Synovial</b> Sarcoma as a teenager.|$|E
25|$|Similar causes as extra-articular {{snapping}} hip syndrome but often with an underlying mechanical {{problem in the}} lower extremity. The pain associated with internal variety {{tends to be more}} intense and therefore more debilitating than the external variety. Intra-articular {{snapping hip}} syndrome is often indicative of injury such as a torn acetabular labrum, recurrent hip subluxation, ligamentum teres tears, loose bodies, articular cartilage damage, or <b>synovial</b> chondromatosis (cartilage formations in the <b>synovial</b> membrane of the joint).|$|E
25|$|<b>Synovial</b> macrophages and {{dendritic}} cells {{function as}} antigen-presenting cells by expressing MHC class II molecules, which establishes the immune {{reaction in the}} tissue.|$|E
25|$|Two studies {{measured}} {{the concentrations of}} glucosamine in the <b>synovial</b> fluid and plasma after oral administration of glucosamine sulfate to both healthy volunteers and people with osteoarthritis.|$|E
25|$|Target {{cells in}} the OA therapy are {{autologous}} chondrocytes, Chondroprogenitor cells, Cells within the <b>synovial</b> cavity, and cells of adjacent tissues such as muscle, tendons, ligaments, and meniscus.|$|E
25|$|The {{central area}} of the disc is {{avascular}} and lacks innervation, and, in contrast, the peripheral region has both blood vessels and nerves. Few cells are present, but fibroblasts and white blood cells are among these. The central area is also thinner but of denser consistency than the peripheral region, which is thicker but has a more cushioned consistency. The <b>synovial</b> fluid in the <b>synovial</b> cavities provides the nutrition for the avascular central {{area of the}} disc. With age, the entire disc thins and may undergo addition of cartilage in the central part, changes {{that may lead to}} impaired movement of the joint.|$|E
25|$|The {{kinematics}} of {{a complete}} spinal motion segment, when one of its constituent spinal joints is manipulated, are much {{more complex than the}} kinematics that occur during manipulation of an independent peripheral <b>synovial</b> joint.|$|E
25|$|Utilization {{of these}} cells as {{curative}} cartilage replacement materials on the cellular level has shown promise, with beneficial applications including the repair and healing of damaged knee menisci and <b>synovial</b> joints; temporomandibular joints, and vertebra.|$|E
25|$|The {{action of}} one single dose is much longer (6 to 8 hr) than the very short {{half-life}} {{of the drug}} indicates. This could be partly because it persists for over 11 hours in <b>synovial</b> fluids.|$|E
25|$|The disease {{progresses}} {{by forming}} granulation tissue {{at the edges}} of the <b>synovial</b> lining, pannus with extensive angiogenesis and enzymes causing tissue damage. The synovium thickens, cartilage and underlying bone begin to disintegrate and the joint is getting destroyed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} study, {{glucosamine}} sulfate {{was given to}} healthy volunteers in doses of 750, 1500 or 3000mg once daily. In the second study, oral glucosamine sulfate capsules (1500mg) were given daily for two weeks to 12 people with osteoarthritis. Glucosamine concentrations in plasma and <b>synovial</b> fluid increased significantly from baseline levels and the levels in the two fluids were highly correlated. The authors interpreted that these levels could be biologically advantageous to articular cartilage, but the levels are still 10 - 100 fold lower than required to positively affect the cartilage (chondrocytes) to build new tissue. Glucosamine sulfate uptake in <b>synovial</b> fluid may {{be as much as}} 20%, or could be negligible, indicating no biological significance.|$|E
25|$|Genes may be {{delivered}} to synovium in animal models of RA and OA by direct, in vivo injection of vector or by indirect, ex vivo methods involving autologous <b>synovial</b> cells, skin fibroblasts, or other cell types such as mesenchymal stem cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{temporomandibular}} joints (TMJ) {{are the two}} joints {{connecting the}} jawbone to the skull. It is a bilateral <b>synovial</b> articulation between the temporal bone of the skull above and the mandible below; it is from these bones that its name is derived.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{measured}} the bioavailability of glucosamine after oral administration to horses. When given as a single oral dose (nine grams) with or without chondroitin sulfate (three grams) to ten horses, glucosamine (hydrochloride) was detected in the blood with a maximum level of 10.6 (+/- 6.9) micrograms per millilitre at two hours after dosing. Another study examined both the serum and the joint <b>synovial</b> fluid after nasogastric (oral) or intravenous administration of 20mg/kg glucosamine hydrochloride to eight adult horses. Although joint fluid concentrations of glucosamine reached 9 - 15 micromolar following intravenous dosing, it was only 0.3 - 0.7 micromolar with nasogastric dosing. The authors calculated that these glucosamine <b>synovial</b> fluid levels achieved by the oral route were 500 fold lower than that required to {{have a positive effect on}} the metabolism of cartilage cells. A follow up study by the same research group compared glucosamine sulfate with glucosamine hydrochloride at the same dose (20mg/kg) in eight horses and found a higher fluid concentration with the sulfate preparation (158ng/mL compared to 89ng/mL one hour post oral dose). They concluded that these higher <b>synovial</b> fluid levels obtained with the sulfate derivative were still too low to have a relevant biological effect on articular cartilage.|$|E
25|$|In anatomy, {{soft tissue}} {{includes}} the tissues that connect, support, or surround other structures and organs of the body, not being hard tissue such as bone. Soft tissue includes tendons, ligaments, fascia, skin, fibrous tissues, fat, and <b>synovial</b> membranes (which are connective tissue), and muscles, nerves and blood vessels (which are not connective tissue).|$|E
25|$|However, during {{onset of}} osteoarthritis, the {{collagen}} matrix becomes more disorganized {{and there is}} a decrease in proteoglycan content within cartilage. The breakdown of collagen fibers results in a net increase in water content. This increase occurs because whilst there is an overall loss of proteoglycans (and thus a decreased osmotic pull), it is outweighed by a loss of collagen. Without the protective effects of the proteoglycans, the collagen fibers of the cartilage can become susceptible to degradation and thus exacerbate the degeneration. Inflammation of the synovium (joint cavity lining) and the surrounding joint capsule can also occur, though often mild (compared to the <b>synovial</b> inflammation that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis). This can happen as breakdown products from the cartilage are released into the <b>synovial</b> space, and the cells lining the joint attempt to remove them.|$|E
25|$|Tendons form in {{the embryo}} from {{fibroblasts}} which become more tightly packed as the tendon grows. As tendons develop they lay down collagen, which is the main structural protein of connective tissue. As tendons pass near bony prominences, they are protected by a fluid filled <b>synovial</b> structure, either a tendon sheath or a sac called a bursa.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} usually manifests about 1–3 {{weeks after}} a known infection. The mechanism {{of interaction between}} the infecting organism and the host is unknown. <b>Synovial</b> fluid cultures are negative, suggesting that reactive arthritis is caused either by an autoimmune response involving cross-reactivity of bacterial antigens with joint tissues or by bacterial antigens that have somehow become deposited in the joints.|$|E
25|$|When {{a doctor}} sees a patient, a history and exam will be taken. Bones are then often imaged, called radiography. This might include {{ultrasound}} X-ray, CT scan, MRI scan and other imaging {{such as a}} Bone scan, which {{may be used to}} investigate cancer. Other tests such as a blood test for autoimmune markers may be taken, or a <b>synovial</b> fluid aspirate may be taken.|$|E
25|$|Arthritis {{of joints}} {{involves}} {{inflammation of the}} <b>synovial</b> membrane. Joints become swollen, tender and warm, and stiffness limits their movement. With time, multiple joints are affected (polyarthritis). Most commonly involved are the small joints of the hands, feet and cervical spine, but larger joints like the shoulder and knee can also be involved. Synovitis can lead to tethering of tissue with loss of movement and erosion of the joint surface causing deformity and loss of function.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{advances}} in ultrasonography like high-frequency transducers (10MHz or higher) have improved the spatial resolution of ultrasound images depicting 20% more erosions than conventional radiography. Color Doppler and power Doppler ultrasound {{are useful in}} assessing the degree of <b>synovial</b> inflammation as they can show vascular signals of active synovitis. This is important, since {{in the early stages}} of RA, the synovium is primarily affected, and synovitis seems to be the best predictive marker of future joint damage.|$|E
25|$|RA {{primarily}} {{starts as}} a state of persistent cellular activation leading to autoimmunity and immune complexes in both joints and other organs where it manifests. The initial site of disease is the <b>synovial</b> membrane, where swelling and congestion leads to infiltration by immune cells. Three phases of progression of RA are an initiation phase, due to non-specific inflammation, an amplification phase, due to T cell activation and chronic inflammatory phase with tissue injury, due to cytokines IL–1, TNF-alpha and IL–6.|$|E
