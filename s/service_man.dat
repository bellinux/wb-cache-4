5|$|In late 1942, {{recruiting}} requirements {{were such}} that both enlisted and officer candidates {{had to be}} American citizens; have no children under 18 years of age; present three character references; pass a physical examination; and submit a record of occupation after leaving school. Enlisted applicants were also required to have completed {{at least two years}} of high school and be between the ages of 20 and 36 years. Officer candidates were expected to be college graduates, or to have completed two years of college, and have at least two years of acceptable business or professional experience, and be between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Certain regulations with respect to marriage applied to both enlisted and officer candidates. Married women could enlist provided their husbands were not in the USCG. Unmarried women had to agree not to marry until they had finished their training period. After training, they could marry a civilian or <b>service</b> <b>man</b> who was not in the USCG.|$|E
25|$|One {{day during}} our lunch {{hour in the}} last week of filming, the craft <b>service</b> <b>man</b> handed out slices of {{watermelon}} to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during Stir Crazy.|$|E
40|$|Objective　To {{explore the}} {{correlation}} between psychosomatic health and situation idiosyncratic coping of army men garrisoned at islands. Methods　By randomized cluster sampling, a total of 499 <b>service</b> <b>men</b> garrisoned at islands were designated as experimental group, and 615 <b>service</b> <b>men</b> garrisoned out of islands were as control group. The both groups were assessed by Chinese Military Psychosomatic Health Scale and Chinese Military Situational Characteristics Scale in the Chinese Soldiers Mental Health Evaluation Instrument (TR- 09), and the influencing factors were analyzed. Results　The scores of each psychosomatic health factor of <b>service</b> <b>men</b> in experimental group were higher than those in control group (t= 7. 513 - 24. 028, P< 0. 01). In the <b>service</b> <b>men</b> of experimental group, the scores of psychotic, anxiety and depression were higher than other factors, and the scores of cardiovascular and skin were lower. With exception of the factors of eye-ear and nervous system, the score of psychosomatic health was lower in the <b>service</b> <b>men</b> with college and above educational background than in those with junior and senior school educational background (F= 0. 526 - 3. 245, P< 0. 05). The psychosomatic health were better in married <b>service</b> <b>men</b> than in unmarried ones (t= 0. 663 - 2. 869, P< 0. 05). With exception of the cardiovascular system, the psychosomatic health score was higher in officers than in soldiers and non-commissioned officers (t=– 1. 434 - – 4. 381, P< 0. 05). With exception of psychotic factor, the psychosomatic health score in <b>service</b> <b>men</b> garrisoned at islands was negatively related to the active coping style (r=– 0. 065 - – 0. 121, P< 0. 05), and positively related to the inactive coping style (r= 0. 062 - 0. 067, P< 0. 05). Conclusions　The psychosomatic health of <b>service</b> <b>men</b> garrisoned at islands is worse. The psychosomatic health of <b>service</b> <b>men</b> with higher educational level, married and low ranked is better. Active coping style is beneficial to psychosomatic health of <b>service</b> <b>men,</b> while inactive coping style plays a damaged role. DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2013. 11. 01...|$|R
