40|$|The Src {{homology}} 3 (SH 3) {{domain of}} the Src family kinase Lyn binds to the herpesviral tyrosine kinase interacting protein (Tip) more than one order of magnitude stronger than other closely related members of the Src family. In order to identify the molecular basis for high-affinity binding, the structure of free and Tip-bound Lyn-SH 3 was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Tip forms additional contacts outside its classical proline-rich recognition motif and, in particular, a strictly conserved leucine (L 186) of the C-terminally adjacent sequence <b>stretch</b> <b>packs</b> into a hydrophobic pocket on the Lyn surface. Although {{the existence of this}} pocket is no unique property of Lyn-SH 3, Lyn is the only Src family kinase that contains an additional aromatic residue (H 41) in the n-Src loop as part of this pocket. H 41 covers L 186 of Tip by forming tight hydrophobic contacts, and model calculations suggest that the increase in binding affinity compared with other SH 3 domains can mainly be attributed to these additional interactions. These findings indicate that this pocket can mediate specificity even between otherwise closely related SH 3 domains...|$|R

In the early stages the two McLaren-Mercedes pulled ahead, netting 12 fastest laps between them from laps 4 to 12. The <b>pack</b> <b>stretched</b> out behind them, while Heinz-Harald Frentzen succumbed to {{pressure}} from Eddie Irvine. On lap 18 David Coulthard retired with engine problems.|$|R
2500|$|Mixer chiropractors [...] "mix" [...] {{diagnostic}} and treatment approaches from chiropractic, medical and/or osteopathic viewpoints {{and make up}} the majority of chiropractors. Unlike straight chiropractors, mixers believe subluxation is one of many causes of disease, and hence they tend to be open to mainstream medicine. Many of them incorporate mainstream medical diagnostics and employ conventional treatments including techniques of physical therapy such as exercise, <b>stretching,</b> massage, ice <b>packs,</b> electrical muscle stimulation, therapeutic ultrasound, and moist heat. Some mixers also use techniques from alternative medicine, including nutritional supplements, acupuncture, homeopathy, herbal remedies, and biofeedback.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the effect of active, passive, and no warm-up {{on the time of}} reaching 75 % of maximum exertion in cycling ergometry testing. The study adopted a randomized repeated measures design. A total of 20 able-bodied adults (11 males, 9 females) were tested in three sessions in random order, namely active warm-up, passive warm-up, and no warm-up. Active warm-up comprised active stretching of thigh muscles, treadmill running, and cycling on an ergometer at low intensity. Passive warm-up comprised passive <b>stretching,</b> hot <b>pack,</b> and massage to both thighs. All subjects underwent cycling ergometry testing with a constant work output in each session. The main outcome measure was the time to reach a level of 15 in the rate of perceived exertion (RPE). Results showed a significant difference (p = 0. 04) in the exercise time before reaching RPE 15 among the three conditions. Post hoc analysis revealed that subjects had longer exercise time after passive warm-up than active warm-up and no warm-up (p = 0. 05 and p = 0. 04, respectively). This result suggests that passive warm-up prior to exercise could lengthen exercise time before subjects reach a high level of perceived exertion in cycling...|$|R
60|$|A niche {{was soon}} found, and Archie and his {{companion}} {{sat down for}} a while. Archie, however, soon discovered that the sides and back of his seat were formed of the strange columns of which Duncan had spoken, {{and that he was}} sitting upon the tops of others which had broken off. Eagerly he passed his hands over the surface of these strange pillars, and questioned his companion as to what he knew about them; but Ronald could tell him no more than his father had done, and Archie was forced to await the dawn to examine more closely the strange columns. Daylight only added to his wonder. On all sides of him <b>stretched</b> the columns, <b>packed</b> in a dense mass together, while range above range they stood {{on the face of the}} great cliffs above him. The more he examined them the more his wonder grew.|$|R
40|$|A {{new concept}} of active {{vibratory}} solar still is experimentally presented. Firstly, a flexible <b>packed</b> <b>stretched</b> media is {{installed in the}} bottom of the basin to increase the efficiency of the still. Secondly, a vibratory harmonic effect is applied. The flexible packed media is formed from stretched helical coiled copper wires, which is considered as a good media for heat absorbing and transferring and as simple thermal storage system. Also, a vibrator (resonator) is installed in the middle of the system structure. The target of using the vibrator is to generate forced vibration to excite the flexible packed media to break the boundary layer and surface tension of the saline water and improve convective heat transfer, and also to excite the condensed polycarbonate glass cover to assist the condensed droplets to slide down before it becomes bigger and possibly falls down in the basin, thus increasing the water vaporization and condensation. The performance is compared with the conventional solar stills (CSS). The vibratory excitation effect is accounted by the new parameter 'vibratory performance gain'. The productivity due to added backed helical wires is found to be 3. 4 l/m day, with efficiency of about 35 %, and the productivity with vibration is increased to be 5. 8 l/mday and the average daily efficiency is about 60 %. The nocturnal production ranges are found from 38 to 57 %...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{parameterization}} {{is necessary}} for many graphics tasks: texture-preserving simplification, remeshing, surface painting, and pre-computation of solid textures. The stretch caused by a given parameterization determines the sampling rate on the surface. In this paper, we propose an automatic parameterization method that segments a surface into patches that are then flattened with little stretch. We observe that many objects consist of regions of relative simple shapes, {{each of which has}} a natural parameterization. Therefore, we propose a three-stage feature based patch creation method for manifold mesh surfaces. The first two stages, genus reduction and feature identification, are performed with the help of distance-based Morse functions. In the last stage, we create one or two patches for each feature region based on a covariance matrix of the feature's surface points. To reduce the stretch during patch unfolding, we notice that the stretch is a 2 x 2 tensor which in ideal situations is the identity. Therefore, we propose to use the Green-Lagrange tensor to measure and to guide the optimization process. Furthermore, we allow the boundary vertices of a patch to be optimized by adding scaffold triangles. We demonstrate our feature identification and patch unfolding methods for several textured models. Finally, to evaluate the quality of a given parameterization, we propose an image-based error measure that takes into account <b>stretch,</b> seams, smoothness, <b>packing</b> efficiency and visibility...|$|R
50|$|From {{the gun in}} the final, Paula Ivan {{wanted the}} lead. Mary Slaney and Ivan's {{teammate}} Doina Melinte didn't want to let her get away. The field behind her looked bunched but the 1:02.52 first lap showed she was serious. This was world record pace, rare for a championship race that usually breaks down into a strategic battle. After the first lap, a small gap began to open. Melinte {{was the last to}} maintain contact, perhaps having seen this strategy previously in domestic competition. The second lap was completed in 1:03.26, a ten-metre gap had opened, with Tetyana Samolenko edging past Melinte in chase. 2:52.66 at the bell and a fifteen-metre gap, Ivan began a last lap kick, trying to run the 60 second last lap to get the world record. Because of the acceleration, the third lap was the fastest of them all at 1:02.46. The battle was for the medals behind Ivan, Andrea Hahmann passing Samolenko, who had Christina Cahill on her shoulder with Lynn Williams in chase. Melinte faded back to Slaney but behind all of them, Laimutė Baikauskaitė was charging. Onto the home <b>stretch</b> the chase <b>pack</b> was tightening, some 30 metres behind Ivan. Baikauskaitė moved into lane 3 to find some running room. Ivan wasn't able to find a 60-second lap, 61.5 was enough to set the Olympic record out of sight with a dominant gold medal performance. Hahmann faded and Samolenko was leading down the stretch with Cahill in close pursuit. Making up ten metres on the final straight, Baikauskaitė passed Cahill and Hahmann in the final 15 metres and leaned past Samolenko at the line to take the silver.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} effect of heat and {{duration}} of stretching on the extensibility of hamstring muscles and their electromyographic responses to passive stretch in children with hypertonia and severe mental retardation. Design: Randomized cross-over trial. Setting: Developmental disability unit in a local hospital. Participants: Twenty-nine subjects (9 females) with ages ranged from 4 to 13 years with spastic and/or dystonic hypertonia and hamstring tightness. Interventions: Subjects received four treatment sessions in random order with each consisting of five repetitions of stretching: (A) 10 -second stretching, (B) 30 -second <b>stretching,</b> (C) hot <b>pack</b> followed by 10 -second stretching, and (D) hot pack followed by 30 -second stretching. Each treatment session comprised five repetitions of stretch and successive treatments were separated by at least 24 hours. Main outcome measures: The distance between greater trochanter and lateral malleolus and hamstring electromyographic (EMG) activity during passive knee extension stretching. Results: Two-way ANOVA showed a larger increase in hamstring extensibility in conditions C and D (1. 3 ± 1. 1 cm) than conditions A and B (0. 7 ± 0. 9 cm) (P < 0. 001). For the EMG recordings, conditions B and D (- 25. 1 ± 58. 4 μV) had greater decrease than conditions A and C (- 3. 5 ± 36. 6 μV) (P = 0. 039). Conclusions: Heat application to the hamstrings before stretching couldresult in greater increase in extensibility than stretching alone in children with hypertonia and severe mental retardation. Stretching could promote relaxation of the hamstring muscles regardless of prior heat treatment. Stretching sustained for 30 seconds led to greater relaxation than that for 10 seconds.

60|$|Teague and {{the cowboys}} were unleashing {{the rest of}} the pack. It surely was great to see them stretch out, yelping wildly. Like the wind they passed us. Jim and Sampson headed into the woods with deep bays. I was riding Teague's best horse for this sort of work and he {{understood}} the game and plainly enjoyed it. R.C.'s horse ran as fast in the woods as he did in the open. This frightened me, and I yelled to R.C. to be careful. I yelled to deaf ears. That is the first great risk--a rider {{is not going to be}} careful! We were right on top of Jim and Sampson with the pack clamoring mad music just behind. The forest rang. Both horses hurdled logs, sometimes two at once. My old lion chases with Buffalo Jones had made me skillful in dodging branches and snags, and sliding knees back to avoid knocking them against trees. For a mile the forest was comparatively open, and here we had a grand and ringing run. I received two hard knocks, was unseated once, but held on, and I got a stinging crack in the face from a branch. R.C. added several more black-and-blue spots to his already spotted anatomy, and he missed, just by an inch, a solid snag that would have broken him in two. The <b>pack</b> <b>stretched</b> out in wild staccato chorus, the little Airedales literally screeching. Jim got out of our sight and then Sampson. Still it was ever more thrilling to follow by sound rather than sight. They led up a thick, steep slope. Here we got into trouble in the windfalls of timber and the pack drew away from us, up over the mountain. We were half way up when we heard them jump the bear. The forest seemed full of strife and bays and yelps. We heard the dogs go down again to our right, and as we turned we saw Teague and the others strung out along the edge of the park. They got far ahead of us. When we reached the bottom of the slope they were out of sight, but we could hear them yell. The hounds were working around on another slope, from which craggy rocks loomed above the timber. R.C.'s horse lunged across the park and appeared to be running off from mine. I was a little to the right, and when my horse got under way, full speed, we had the bad luck to plunge suddenly into soft ground. He went to his knees, and I sailed out of the saddle fully twenty feet, to alight all spread out and to slide like a plow. I did not seem to be hurt. When I got up my horse was coming and he appeared to be patient with me, but he was in a hurry. Before we got across the wet place R.C. was out of sight. I decided that instead of worrying about him I had better think about myself. Once on hard ground my horse fairly charged into the woods and we broke brush and branches as if they had been punk. It was again open forest, then a rocky slope, and then a flat ridge with aisles between the trees. Here I heard the melodious notes of Teague's hunting horn, and following that, the full chorus of the hounds. They had treed the bear. Coming into still more open forest, with rocks here and there, I caught sight of R.C. far ahead, and soon I had glimpses of the other horses, and lastly, while riding full tilt, I spied a big, black, glistening bear high up in a pine a hundred yards or more distant.|$|R
