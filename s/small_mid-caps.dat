40|$|Having a {{sustainable}} growth in economy {{of developing countries}} requires appropriate infrastructures {{and part of it}} depends on gaining market share in international market. In this paper, we present an empirical investigation to find out the effects of various factors on helping export for <b>small</b> and <b>mid-cap</b> firms. The proposed study designs a questionnaire in Likert scale consists of 70 questions and distributes it among some randomly selected <b>small</b> and <b>mid-cap</b> firms. The study considers whether or not improving relationships between countries positively influences on empowering firms and export capabilities. In addition, the study also considers whether or not improving national strategies for developing exports positively influences on empowering firms and export capabilities. The study also tries to find out whether or not changes on rules and regulations harms export capabilities. Using structural equation modeling, the study confirms that empowering <b>small</b> and <b>mid-cap</b> firms contributes the whole economy through boosting export...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} additions to and deletions from the Russell Value Index and the Russell 2000 Growth Index. The study documents stronger comovement in value reconstitutions relative to growth reconstitutions. This result {{is consistent with}} the hypothesis that nonfundamental comovement is related to the common factor in value stock returns. The mechanism of causality is difficult to determine, however; trade demand, firm characteristics and information diffusion are presented as potential sources that could explain why comovement of <b>small</b> to <b>mid-cap</b> value stocks is greater than the comovement of <b>small</b> to <b>mid-cap</b> growth stocks. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} on mutual fund persistence took {{a hit with}} the finding that one-year stock momentum and expense ratios account {{for most of the}} persistence in mutual fund performance (Carhart, 1992; Carhart, 1997). However, since equity mutual funds are grouped into styles (e. g., large value, <b>small</b> growth, <b>mid-cap</b> growth, etc.) and are often confined to trading stocks within their style, one should measure fund performance relative to style when investigating managerial ability. Using CRSP mutual fund data and a methodology similar to Carhart (1997), we find that differences in style-adjusted fund returns persist for up to six years. Neither one-year momentum nor expense ratios explain our results. Our results are also robust to controlling for size, book-to-market equity, load, and total net assets. Since manager tenure is about four years, our results suggest that managerial ability may not be as dead as it seems...|$|R

50|$|The index {{calculation}} methodology {{is identical to}} that of the SET Index, which is a market capitalization weighted index. This means the larger the capitalization of a stock, the more its weight in the index. The industry group and sectoral index calculations are adjusted in line with the same factors that influence the calculation of the SET Index. These influencing factors include the shifting of a stock from one sector to another sector or the shifting of a stock from a sector in one industry group to a sector in another industry group. The base date of the industry group indices is on 31 December 2003, which was when the industry group indices were established and set at 100 points.Smaller capitalized shares are underrepresented because both institutions and traders by their very mandate must avoid these due to liquidity constraints. For this reason many <b>smaller</b> or <b>mid-cap</b> Thai stocks may be underpriced. Smaller companies in Thailand make up over 70% of its GDP and often have higher growth rates then the averages. Yet, most trade at P/E discounts to the Thai market while often yielding considerably higher dividends. There is no Thai small cap index.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Since 1980 s a {{new field}} of {{business}} has emerged in the financial world. Private Equity funds invest into companies with significant growth potential, cash flows or consolidation opportunities. Several previous {{studies have focused on}} the operational performance under the private equity ownership. However, the managerial compensation under the private equity ownership has drawn little academic research as a result of reluctance to publish the compensation figures. This thesis contributes to the existing literature and provides a comprehensive view on the compensation levels for portfolio company CEOs in Finnish context. DATA I have based my numerical study on a data sample of 42 private equity owned company CEO's annual monetary compensation between 2009 and 2011 and the respective company financial information between 2008 and 2011. All the managers are situated in Finland and thus taxed under Finnish tax legislation. I have combined the hand-collected company specific data to respective management compensation figures retrieved from the tax authorities. I have benchmarked the data sample to <b>small</b> and <b>mid-cap</b> companies listed in the OMX Helsinki stock exchange. RESULTS My findings support the hypothesis that managers in portfolio companies receive smaller annual compensation compared to their peers in public companies. The difference is likely compensated by the possible exit proceedings. However, I did not find statistically significant relation between company's profitability measured as EBITDA and management compensation. The results support previous academic studies, that managers in larger companies measured as net sales receive higher annual compensation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – There is {{conjecture}} that <b>small</b> and <b>mid-cap</b> {{companies in}} highly speculative industries use frequent and repetitive disclosure to promote price volatility and heighten market interest. Excessive disclosure could indicate instances of self-promotion or poor disclosure practices, and these habits could mislead investors. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to quantitatively investigate the impact of firm disclosure on price volatility in the Australian stock market. Design/methodology/approach – This paper considers the effect of information disclosure on the daily stock price volatility of 340 Metals & Mining industry entities listed on the Australian Securities Exchange over the period 2005 - 2007 using regression analysis. Findings – The results indicate the number of disclosures, the number of price and non-price sensitive disclosures and the number of disclosures by category has a significant influence on daily price volatility. Moreover, the volatility impact of disclosure is greater for small and mid-sized firms than large firms. Research limitations/implications – Price volatility is calculated using daily data; intra-day stock prices could provide measures that are more accurate. There is also no attempt to allow for asymmetry in disclosure; categorizing news as “good” or “bad” would allow better insights. Practical implications – There is support for the conjecture that disclosure could serve as a self-promotion tool through fabricated and repetitive announcements. Inadvertent poor disclosure practice could also result in excessive price volatility. Disclosure practice requires ongoing consideration by regulatory bodies. Originality/value – This analysis complements basic work by the Australian regulator to establish a quantitative link between disclosure practice and price volatility.
