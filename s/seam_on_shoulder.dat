30|$|The lignites of the Barmer basin are chiefly {{composed}} of the huminite group of macerals while the liptinite and inertinite group macerals occur in low concentrations. There is not much variation in the maceral composition from Seam-I to Seam-VIII. Huminite (85.9  vol%, mean of all the <b>seams</b> <b>on</b> mmf basis) is comprised mainly of telohuminite and detrohuminite. Telohuminite is mainly contributed by ulminite-A (24.4  %) and ulminite-B (20.9  %). Detrohuminite consists of densinite (32.2  %) and attrinite (7.6  %). Gelohuminite is present in very small amounts. Among the liptinites (8.8  vol%, mean of all the <b>seams</b> <b>on</b> mmf basis), resinite (5 – 40  µm) (5  %) sporinite (1.1  %), cutinite (0.5  %) are common. Few sections show megaspores and megacuticles. Few patches of suberinite are seen, showing clearly developed cortex cells. Among the inertinites (5.3  vol%, mean of all the <b>seams</b> <b>on</b> mmf basis), fusinite (2.2  %) with bogen structure was observed especially in Seam-IV and VIII. Seam-I and Seam-VI from the Giral mine have shown good fungal bodies. Mineral matter (11.6  vol%, mean of all the seams) occurs in moderate concentration in all the seams of the Giral mine.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first use}} of this {{technique}} {{goes back to the}} 1920s, when leather, canvas and vinyl were sometimes used along with landau bars, to give a fairly accurate reproduction of a horse-drawn carriage's movable top.

This Model [...] "A" [...] Special Coupe's vinyl roof had two exposed <b>seams</b> <b>on</b> the back corners, with a lateral <b>seam</b> <b>on</b> the top covered with a narrow trim strip; landau bars were not provided on this model. The technique fell out of favor in the 1930s and 1940s, when smoother, [...] "envelope" [...] bodies began to be fashionable; for these designs, the look of the modern, integrated metal roof was important.|$|R
