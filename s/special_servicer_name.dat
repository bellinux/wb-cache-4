40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{model is}} {{presented}} {{which allows the}} compo-sition of web services {{by means of a}} <b>special</b> web <b>service,</b> <b>named</b> WSInter-Connect. Such a service might be used in a portal environment to allow interactive services lookup and creation of permanent composed services in the design stage, and for efficiently resolving missing parameters dur-ing the runtime of a process. The portal integration relies on augmented service description files based on WSGUI concepts [1], and provides a usable infrastructure for BPEL 4 People [4] concepts. ...|$|R

40|$|A naming or {{identification}} {{scheme is}} crucial to the design of any computer system. One must be able to access and perform operations on resources and data in order to complete a given task. In a distributed system the problem is compounded by the geographical separation of resources. Moreover, the underlying network of computers should be transparent to the users. A user should simply be able to request that an operation be performed and the system should locate the necessary resources. This function of locating a named resource is performed by a <b>special</b> <b>service</b> called a <b>name</b> <b>service.</b> This thesis investigates and develops a <b>name</b> <b>service</b> that provides such capability...|$|R
40|$|A {{system of}} {{middleware}} services is proposed to realize transparent Object Oriented (OO) modeling in multi-simulator systems. Shortcomings of Remote Procedure Call schemes in a multi-simulator setting are identified. The use of simulation time synchronization services is suggested instead. The resulting middleware system supports both asynchronous and synchronous interaction. Remote Method Invocation Scheduling (RMIS) is introduced {{as the main}} enabling mechanism. <b>Special</b> <b>naming</b> <b>services</b> are introduced to generate required middleware objects. The middleware system is fully transparent to model objects, which may thus remain deployment neutral. Current results and directions for further research are presented. ...|$|R
