This antibiotic has also been used to select resistant bacterial mutants, some of which vary in iron utilization. We {{examined the effects of}} <b>streptonigrin</b> on Neisseria gonorrhoeae and several types of gonococcal mutants. <b>Streptonigrin</b> (0. 025 microgram/ml) efficiently killed gonococcal strain FA 1090, and this effect depended on iron. Streptonigrin-resistant mutant FA 6271 had normal iron uptake but was moderately deficient in total iron. Resistance most likely resulted from failure of FA 6271 to divert electrons to <b>streptonigrin,</b> as demonstrated by a reduction in KCN-insensitive respiration (a hallmark of the action of quinones) and superoxide formation. Other mutants selected for inability to use human iron-binding proteins (strains FA 6273 and FA 6275) had no increase in <b>streptonigrin</b> MIC and no decrease in KCN-insensitive respiration. Mutants did not demonstrate an increase in superoxide dismutase or catalase. <b>Streptonigrin</b> killing of gonococci depended on a reaction(s) in which extracellular iron was important, presumably because iron was required for catalysis of hydroxyl radical.

The level of iron uptake by these mutants was manipulated by agents such as (i) the enterochelin biosynthetic precursors 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid (2 x 10 (- 5) M) and shikimic acid (2 x 10 (- 4) M), (ii) citrate (10 (- 2) M), which promotes iron uptake by an independent pathway, and (iii) the chelating agents desferrioxamine (2 x 10 (- 4) M) and orthophenanthroline (10 (- 4) M). Addition of the precursors shikimate and dihydroxybenzoate to strain AB 2847 (aroB) and dihydroxybenzoate to strain AN 193 (entA), allowing these strains to make enterochelin, resulted in an increase in Fe 3 + uptake and a corresponding sharp increase in killing by <b>streptonigrin.</b> Addition of enterochelin itself (10 (- 6) M) caused an even more pronounced effect.

(1961), reviewing a series of patients with advanced malignant disease treated by single daily intravenous injections of the drug, {{came to the conclusion that}} although improvement was seen in some cases of Hodgkin's disease, <b>Streptonigrin</b> was probably of limited clinical value because of its severe toxic effect upon bone marrow. Other similar studies by Humphrey and Blank (1961) and Wilson, Labra and Barrist (1961) while demonstrating that the drug had some anti-tumour activity, also emphasised its depressant effect on bone marrow. Sullivan et al. (1963) suggested that by administering <b>streptonigrin</b> by continuous intravenous infusion its bone marrow toxicity could be diminished without any concomitant loss of anti-tumour activity. This was supported by Harris et al. (1964) who also showed that the drug was effective when administered orally. In both these more recent trials, significant objective responses in a wide range of cases of advanced malignant disease were reported. With these facts in mind, we have conducted a clinical trial of <b>Streptonigrin</b> on a small group (21) of patients with advanced malignant disease.

Heterochromatin is also becoming more recognized to be implicated in cancer and may serve as a potential target for cancer therapy. To our knowledge, there are no drugs that are well-established to promote heterochromatin. Here, we describe and perform two simple screening methods to identify compounds that may promote heterochromatin. We screened Oncology Set III, a set of FDA approved oncology drugs, using DX 1 mutant flies whose eye color phenotype is sensitive to heterochromatin levels. This screen produced no hits and was inconclusive. We then screened Natural Set II, a set of natural compounds, using a cell based method. One drug, <b>streptonigrin,</b> increased the brightness and induced the formation of visible foci of DNA stain Hoechst 33258 in HeLa cell nuclei, indicative of increase in heterochromatin levels. We then showed that Heterochromatin Protein 1 alpha (HP 1 [alpha]) foci co- localizes with DNA foci in <b>streptonigrin</b> treated cells, further indicating the drug affects heterochromatin formation. The induction of heterochromatin reorganization by <b>streptonigrin</b> was also seen to be concentration dependent in 3 T 3 cells by observation of nuclear morphology.

40|$|Pd-catalyzed {{coupling}} reactions have a central place in synthetic chemistry. In particular, studies from the DeShong laboratory {{have demonstrated that}} aryltrialkoxysilanes, {{in the presence of}} Pd(0) and fluoride, are capable of aryl group transfer to a range of aryl halides and triflates and allylic benzoates. The cross-coupling reaction represents an ideal opportunity to construct the tetracyclic core of the anticancer agent <b>streptonigrin.</b> This strategy is highly convergent and readily amenable to the synthesis of analogues, and as such would constitute an improvement over previous total syntheses of this natural product. A series of 4 -bromopyridines (<b>streptonigrin</b> C ring precursors) were prepared, and their couplings with various arylsiloxanes (<b>streptonigrin</b> D ring precursors) examined. The coupling reaction generally tolerated the preparation of sterically demanding biaryls. The coupling of the 3 -nitro- 4 -bromopyridine derivative was problematic, as dehalogenation was found to compete with arylation. The use of nitro group surrogates and a variety of catalyst systems offered no improvement. These results indicated the coupling reaction is highly sensitive to the electronic environment of bromopyridine. The analogous biaryl coupling reaction employing an organoboron species was more effective and allowed for additional <b>streptonigrin</b> CD analogues to be prepared. This reaction was found to be highly sensitive to the reaction conditions. A fully functionalized C ring precursor (prepared in 10 synthetic operations) underwent Suzuki coupling with a fully functionalized D ring precursor (prepared in 3 steps) to give an adduct possessing the <b>streptonigrin</b> CD skeleton.

40|$|Many {{strains of}} Escherichia coli {{isolated}} from extraintestinal infections {{of humans and}} domestic animals are able to synthesize two siderophores, aerobactin and enterochelin.

We have used <b>streptonigrin,</b> which is bactericidal in the presence of iron, as a probe to determine levels of free intracellular iron during bacterial growth promoted by the two siderophores. A strain with only enterochelin remained sensitive to the bactericidal action of <b>streptonigrin,</b> suggesting that assimilated iron was contributed to an intracellular pool from which the rate of its withdrawal for growth is probably concentration dependent.

Aerobactin, probably because it is repeatedly reusable, efficiently stimulated bacterial growth at external concentrations some 500 -fold lower than those of enterochelin. Moreover, the effective concentration, and thus the siderophore activity, of enterochelin but not of aerobactin was significantly reduced by the presence of human serum in the medium.

40|$|<b>Streptonigrin</b> {{has shown}} {{activity}} against several tumours (e. g. breast and lung). The drug induces cytotoxicity by impairing DNA synthesis via inhibition of Topoisomerase II and direct damage to DNA through attack by ROS (reactive oxygen species), {{the latter of}} which has been linked to the aminoquinone domain [Bolzc'm and Bianchi 2001]. <b>Streptonigrin</b> exists in one of three possible oxidation states, the oxidised quinone, the le- reduced semiquinone radical and a 2 e- reduced hydroquinone. The semiquinone radical has been linked to the production of ROS species through redox cycling in the presence of oxygen. The superoxide and hydroxyl radicals cause damage to various cellular constituents e. g. proteins and nucleic acids (HO· is the primary source of the drug's toxicity). In addition to this <b>streptonigrin</b> has a high affinity for different metal ions e. g. iron and copper. The drug-metal complexes are known to increase streptonigrin's binding affinity to DNA [Bolzfm and Bianchi 2001]. Little is known about the effects of the metal on the chemical and biological activity of the drug. Most of the research on the redox chemistry of <b>streptonigrin</b> (SN) has consisted of NMR studies of SN metal complexes in organic solvents at concentrations which are not feasible at physiological conditions. This research focused on determining the precise mechanism involved in <b>streptonigrin</b> semiquinone formation; the precise role of different metal ions in semiquinone formation and the affect of different pH via two buffers with different pHs (5. 5 and 9. 5).

The synthesis of the highly effective, yet prohibitively toxic, antitumor antibiotic <b>streptonigrin</b> is targeted in this research. A concise, convergent synthesis of this antitumor agent will pave the way for an expeditous survey of <b>streptonigrin</b> analogues that have similar pharmaceutical value with diminished toxicity. Our retrosynthetic plan required the development of new methodology to form the heterocyclic ring of quinoline, in a manner that would allow the utilization of palladium-catalyzed coupling of complex aryl triflates to form the tetracyclic structure of this highly functionalized natural product. A method has been developed to synthesize complex, substituted quinolines in a facile manner through the utilization of o-nitrophenyl propargyl alcohols. Through either direct lithium acetylide addition of available alkynes, or Sonogashira coupling to terminal propargyl alcohols, the assembly of complex internal propargyl alcohols has directly lead to 2 -aryl-, 2 -alkenyl- and 2 -alkylquinolines via reductive cyclization under mildly acid conditions. This reductive cyclization takes advantage of the facile Meyer-Schuster rearrangement of resonance-stabilized o-anilinopropargyl alcohols to o-aminochalcones, which cyclize to quinoline in a one-pot procedure. This work has also examined the use of this reductive cyclization to form 2 -pyridylquinolines, however such cyclization has repeatedly led to the 4 -quinolone. The mechanism of such an anomalous cyclization has been studied. Although the mechanism has not been definitively identified, several potential pathways have been examined, with evidence favoring an acid-catalyzed, non-Meyer-Schuster rearrangement of the propargyl alcohol leading to cyclization and oxidative rearomatization to form the observed quinolone.

The introduction of an asymmetric Suzukiâ Miyaura reaction yielded a key intermediate in 42 % ee and 65 % yield, which represents the first example of purely synthetic access to enantioenriched late-stage <b>streptonigrin</b> analogues. The "hydrogen-borrowing" method allows the functionalization of ketones with methanol and transition metal catalysts, but examples lacked application to further Î±-functionalization. The successful development of a novel "interrupted- hydrogen-borrowing" method allowed the use of iridium and methanol to trap the reactive enone intermediates by preventing the subsequent "hydrogen returning". Thus, this enabled these reactive intermediates to be subjected to a 1, 4 -conjugate addition with a nucleophilic ketone enolate and subsequent cyclization and oxidation to form highly substituted pyridines from simple ketones. The exploration of serine hydrolases, an important mammalian enzyme class with a large portion still uncharacterized, requires inhibitors with new chemotypes that can covalently and irreversibly bind. The small library of urea- and carbamate- containing scaffolds with varied aromatic backbone substitutions was subjected to activity-based protein profiling to allow expedient examination of the whole serine hydrolase family. The predicted strong electronic effect of the p-substituent was confirmed, modulating the reactivity of the electrophilic urea or carbamate moiety. MudPIT analysis of a subset supported the demonstrated reactivity profile and identified the uncharacterized serine hydrolase PNPLA 4 as a selective target of one inhibitor. This potent and selective inhibition was verified by in vitro and in cell assays and validates this chemotype as a family of serine hydrolase inhibitors. </p...|$|E

40|$|D. Sc. The {{objective}} of the research described in this thesis {{was to develop a}} general synthetic method which could be applied to the synthesis of the potent anti-cancer compound, <b>streptonigrin,</b> and analogues thereof. The approach was based on retrosynthetic analysis as well as a critical appraisal of previous approaches to the synthesis or partial synthesis of such compounds, and relied heavily on palladium-catalysed carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. The research was, therefore, carried out against the background of a detailed literature study, which is summarised in the first chapter of this thesis. The first problem that received attention was the development of a general route to synthetic equivalents of the <b>streptonigrin</b> AB quinoline system, with potential for coupling to the CD moiety. This route centres on the use of appropriately substituted o-nitrophenyltriflates (readily prepared via ortho nitration and triflation of the corresponding phenols) as key intermediates. A palladium-catalysed Heck reaction of various o-nitrophenyl triflates, followed by reduction of the ortho nitro group and cyclisation of the resultant aminocinnamate, provided access to a variety of substituted 2 -hydroxyquinolines. These could be converted to the corresponding 2 -halo derivatives using known methodology. The instability of highly electron-deficient triflates under basic Heck conditions {{led to the development of}} this reaction under neutral conditions using epichlorohydrin as a neutral proton scavenger. The preparation of two <b>streptonigrin</b> AB equivalents was achieved using this route, but was initially complicated by competitive oxidation reactions encountered upon nitration of the electron-rich starting material, 3, 5 - dimethoxyphenol. The use of nitronium tetrafluoroborate or claycop as the nitrating agent was shown to largely overcome these problems. The successful nitration of a selection of other electron-rich aromatics was also achieved using these reagents. The significance of these results is evident: The direct nitration of several of these substrates has not been reported previously. The o-nitrophenyl triflates employed as intermediates in 2 -hydroxyquinoline synthesis were also shown to be versatile intermediates for the synthesis of a variety of other heterocyclic compounds. The o-nitrocinnamate products obtained from the Heck reaction of o-nitrophenyl triflates with methyl acrylate furnished the corresponding indole- 2 -carboxylates via reductive cyclisation. o-Nitrophenyl triflates were also shown to be excellent substrates for palladiumcatalysed cross-coupling reactions. The resulting 2 -nitrobiphenyl products provided ready access to substituted carbazoles, and can also be used in the synthesis of fluorenones, phenanthridinones and phenanthridines...|$|E

40|$|Oxygen {{caused an}} {{increase}} in the amount of superoxide dismutase in Escherichia coli B but not in Bacillus subtilis. E. coli B cells, induced by growth under 100 % O 2, were much more resistant to the lethal effects of 20 atm of O 2 than were cells which contained the low uninduced level of this enzyme. In contrast, B. subtilis, which could not respond to O 2 by increasing its content of superoxide dismutase, remained equally sensitive to hyperbaric O 2 whether grown under 100 % O 2 or areobically. The catalase in these organisms exhibited a reciprocal response to oxygen. Thus, the catalase of E. coli B was not induced by O 2, whereas that of B. subtilis was so induced. These results are consistent with the view that superoxide dismutase is {{an important component of the}} defenses of these organisms against the toxicity of oxygen, whereas their catalases are of secondary importance in this respect. The ability of <b>streptonigrin</b> to generate O 2 −, by a cycle of reduction followed by spontaneous reoxidation, has been verified in vitro. It is further observed that E. coli B which contain the high induced level of superoxide dismutase were more resistant to the lethality of this antibiotic, in the presence of oxygen, than were E. coli B which contained the low uninduced level of this enzyme. This difference between induced and uninduced cells was eliminated by the removal of O 2. These results are consistent with the proposal that the enhanced lethality of <b>streptonigrin</b> under aerobic conditions may relate to its in vivo generation of O 2 − by a cycle of reduction and spontaneous reoxidation. In toto, these observations lend support to the hypothesis that O 2 − is an important agent of oxygen toxicity and that superoxide dismutase functions to blunt the threat posed by this reactive radical...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Accumulating {{evidence}} supports {{the concept that}} melanoma is highly heterogeneous and sustained by a small subpopulation of melanoma stem-like cells. Those cells are considered as responsible for tumor resistance to therapies. Moreover, melanoma cells are characterized by their high phenotypic plasticity. Consequently, both melanoma stem-like cells and their more differentiated progeny must be eradicated to achieve durable cure. By reevaluating compounds in heterogeneous melanoma populations, {{it might be possible}} to select compounds with activity not only against fast-cycling cells but also against cancer stem-like cells. Natural compounds were the focus of the present study. METHODS: We analyzed 120 compounds from The Natural Products Set II to identify compounds active against melanoma populations grown in an anchorage-independent manner and enriched with cells exerting self-renewing capacity. Cell viability, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, gene expression, clonogenic survival and label-retention were analyzed. FINDINGS: Several compounds efficiently eradicated cells with clonogenic capacity and nanaomycin A, <b>streptonigrin</b> and toyocamycin were effective at 0. 1 µM. Other anti-clonogenic but not highly cytotoxic compounds such as bryostatin 1, siomycin A, illudin M, michellamine B and pentoxifylline markedly reduced the frequency of ABCB 5 (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B, member 5) -positive cells. On the contrary, treatment with maytansine and colchicine selected for cells expressing this transporter. Maytansine, <b>streptonigrin,</b> toyocamycin and colchicine, even if highly cytotoxic, left a small subpopulation of slow-dividing cells unaffected. Compounds selected in the present study differentially altered the expression of melanocyte/melanoma specific microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and proto-oncogene c-MYC. CONCLUSION: Selected anti-clonogenic compounds might be further investigated as potential adjuvants targeting melanoma stem-like cells in the combined anti-melanoma therapy, whereas selected cytotoxic but not anti-clonogenic compounds, which increased the frequency of ABCB 5 -positive cells and remained slow-cycling cells unaffected, might be considered as a tool to enrich cultures with cells exhibiting melanoma stem cell characteristics...|$|E
