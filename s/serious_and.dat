5|$|After {{arriving}} at Sucre, {{it was decided}} that García Márquez should start his formal education and he was sent to an internship in Barranquilla, a port on the mouth of the Río Magdalena. There, he gained a reputation of being a timid boy who wrote humorous poems and drew humorous comic strips. <b>Serious</b> <b>and</b> little interested in athletic activities, he was called El Viejo by his classmates.|$|E

5|$|Broadly speaking, Anons oppose Internet {{censorship}} and control, {{and the majority}} of their actions target governments, organizations, and corporations that they accuse of censorship. Anons were early supporters of the global Occupy movement and the Arab Spring. Since 2008, a frequent subject of disagreement within Anonymous is whether members should focus on pranking and entertainment or more <b>serious</b> (<b>and,</b> in some cases, political) activism.|$|E

5|$|Captain Lang is a fully matured character, <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> calm in his demeanor, yet {{definite}} {{and energetic}} when strength was needed. Very good attitude as an officer. Demands of himself first. He understands {{how to reach}} the men under his command correctly. Captain Lang possesses an exemplary concept of service, has initiative and talent for improvisation to a large degree, well rooted in the National Socialist ideas.|$|E
5|$|It seems hardly {{likely that}} we are even to-day so lukewarm in our {{interest}} in letters or serious discussion as to be content to reduce our treatment of sex to the standard of a child's library in the supposed interest of a salacious few, or that shame will for long prevent us from adequate portrayal {{of some of the}} most <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> beautiful sides of human nature.|$|E

5|$|The set was Haydn's first {{complete}} set of quartets since the Opus 33 set of 1781. While the Opus 33 set was apt for broad public consumption, the Opus 50 set is more <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> experimental. It is {{perhaps because of the}} Opus 50's intellectual character that other sets among Haydn's mature quartets have received more attention from performers.|$|E
5|$|These early knives {{sold for}} between $800 and $2,000 each; that, {{combined}} with his appearances at knife shows and write-ups in knife magazines, helped Emerson gain status and {{credibility as a}} custom knifemaker. Once established as a <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> reputable maker, Emerson was soon able to concentrate on making the knives he wanted to make—knives designed for use as opposed to show, specifically folding-knives designed for combat.|$|E
5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist leaders have traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as being different from previous Peronist leaders. He made {{frequent use of}} controversies with other political or social forces and the polarization of public opinion, which became characteristic of his political style. This strategy was used against the financial sector, the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself {{with varying degrees of}} success. Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa. Menem was seen as frivolous and De la Rúa as doubtful, so Kirchner tried to be seen as <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> determined.|$|E

5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} contraindicated {{in situations where}} the reduction in clotting that they cause might lead to <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or lumbar puncture (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E
5|$|Also like Bewick, many {{articles}} {{end with}} a tail-piece, a small engraving, but here again Yarrell shows himself to be both more <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> less merely decorative than Bewick, with more information to impart. The Egyptian vulture article ends with a large and accurate engraving of another specimen, so the article shows both a young and an old bird, with clearly different plumage which is also described in the text.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{stint as}} Minister of Commerce {{significantly}} raised his international profile and generated media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, articulate and open-minded in {{his approach to}} problems, Bo's rise from a municipal official to the central government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a 'political star.' Bo's political persona was considered {{a departure from the}} generally <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> conservative leadership in Beijing. With his youthful vigour, populism, and purported popularity with female reporters, Bo's political rise had been compared to that of John F. Kennedy.|$|E

Visitors {{to the site}} wrote favourably of Capaldi's actions to record the video for the child. A few observed that Capaldi's version of the Doctor character is sinister and <b>serious,</b> <b>and</b> contrasted this with the actor's depiction of the character as warm and effusive in his recording.|$|E
5|$|Cassidy Sharp (voiced by Jennifer Hale): The game's {{first female}} protagonist. Cassidy is the agent who {{attempts}} to stop Jericho {{on the train}} in the game's opening sequence. After the explosion of Lazarus' prison, she joins Jericho but is soon murdered by Lazarus. Cassidy returns as a good ghost and befriends Jericho, aiding him in his mission to stop Lazarus (a role similar to this of Cortana in the Halo series). As a little girl, Cassidy was orphaned in a vampire attack and then raised as a ward of the Darkwatch. Eventually, she became the most <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> dangerous agent in the organisation, yet really she is also deeply insecure about herself. If fought as the final boss, she turns into an angel.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{released}} {{to the news media}} by the animal rights organization Uncaged Campaigns showed that, between 1994 and 2000, wild baboons imported to the UK from Africa by Imutran Ltd, a subsidiary of Novartis Pharma AG, in conjunction with Cambridge University and Huntingdon Life Sciences, to be used in experiments that involved grafting pig tissues, suffered <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> sometimes fatal injuries. A scandal occurred when it was revealed that the company had communicated with the British government in an attempt to avoid regulation.|$|E

5|$|In 1902, Warner {{played one}} {{professional}} football {{game for the}} Syracuse Athletic Club during the first World Series of Football at Madison Square Garden. In the first professional indoor football game, Syracuse defeated the heavily favored New York team. During the series, Warner was seriously cut {{on the side of}} his head. Although he laughed it off at first, the injury turned out to be more <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> he was replaced with Blondy Wallace for the rest of the series. For the tournament, Warner and the other team members earned $23 (approximately $816 in 2016), although the expected share was $300 (approximately $8,000 in 2016) per player; it was a financial failure.|$|E
5|$|Levin {{reviewed}} {{television for}} the Manchester Guardian {{and wrote a}} weekly political column in The Spectator noted for its irreverence and influence on modern parliamentary sketches. During the 1960s he wrote five columns {{a week for the}} Daily Mail on any subject that he chose. After a disagreement with the proprietor of the paper over attempted censorship of his column in 1970, Levin moved to The Times where, with one break of just over a year in 1981–82, he remained as resident columnist until his retirement, covering a wide range of topics, both <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> comic.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{recorded}} the album in New York City with Shep Pettibone and André Betts {{while she was}} working on her book and film projects. She began creating the album's demos with Pettibone in his apartment in October 1991. Madonna wrote the melodies and lyrics on top of the basic music which Pettibone produced in the style of his remixes. During the sessions, they had problems during sequencing, and, as a result, Pettibone kept trying to move development as fast as possible as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in the music. According to him, Madonna's compositions were <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> intense, directing the creative direction of the songs into a deeply personal territory.|$|E
