5|$|In some cases, it is {{difficult}} to tell whether a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been <b>switched</b> <b>off</b> and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an atavism. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (selectively neutral) has a steadily decreasing probability of retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.|$|E
30|$|We first {{propose a}} {{heuristic}} dynamic <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> (HDSO) algorithm, which tests PBSs to <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> {{one by one}} at each step, and {{is similar to the}} <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> algorithm proposed in [16]. It turns out that after this algorithm is executed, the number of active PBSs can track the network traffic profile very well. Simulations show that some parameters can significantly influence the performance of HDSO. Besides, its complexity can be prohibitive for large-size network with dense deployment of PBSs and peak traffic time.|$|R

Leutnant Arnold Döring of IV./NJG 3 engaged and destroyed two bombers between 01:05 and 01:15 using his Schräge Musik. The British crews that witnessed the action <b>switched</b> <b>off</b> their navigation lights {{and he did not}} engage another bomber successfully. Döring had been told not to return with any ammunition so he engaged any targets of opportunity. He shot up a locomotive and set a wagon on fire. During the ten-minute time-frame Döring had claimed his victories, nine bombers had been destroyed. At 01:05 60 of No. 5 Group's Lancasters were still airborne and further losses were incurred against NJG 5 machines.|$|E

Sleep-and-charge USB ports remain powered even when the computer is off. On laptops, charging devices from the USB port when it is not being powered from AC drains the laptop battery faster; most laptops have a facility to stop charging if their own battery charge level gets too low. This feature has also been implemented on some laptop docking stations allowing device charging even when no laptop is present.|$|E
5|$|The 9/11 Commission {{estimated}} that the flight was hijacked between 08:51 and 08:54, shortly after American Airlines Flight 11 struck the World Trade Center and not too long after United Airlines Flight 175 had been hijacked. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08:50:51. Unlike the other three flights, there were no reports of anyone being stabbed or a bomb threat and the pilots were not immediately killed but shoved {{to the back of}} the plane with the rest of the passengers. At 08:54, the plane began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south. Two minutes later at 08:56, the plane's transponder was <b>switched</b> <b>off.</b> The hijackers set the flight's autopilot on a course heading east towards Washington, D.C.|$|E

30|$|Various {{versions}} of TCP such as AIMP, Cubic, Bic, Vegas, and CTCP are studied {{to analyze the}} congestion window and average throughput values in [88]. The ESTOP algorithm is used for decreasing the congestion window value. ESTOP <b>switches</b> <b>off</b> links in increasing order of an associated centrality level of the network by {{counting the number of}} shortest paths. In the algorithm, the <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> count is associated with a threshold value which preserves the network connectivity. After <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> operation, the link state update of OSPF is used for changing the topology. The ESTOP is simulated in the Abilene network. In simulations, a TCP flow is established between two distant nodes in the network. For the worst case scenario, the outermost two nodes are selected as TCP flow endpoints, and in these nodes, TCP flow is also affected in terms of available capacity after the links <b>switch</b> <b>off.</b> It is observed that, for the considered TCP versions, it is possible to gain energy in the network without a drastic compromise of the TCP performance. The <b>switching</b> <b>off</b> links obtained by using ESTOP produce higher energy savings.|$|R

5|$|The Government of Croatia {{decided that}} {{multicast}} (simultaneous analog and digital DVB-T broadcasting {{of the main}} channels) was to cease in 2010. The territory of Croatia was split into nine digital-TV allotment regions. The analog broadcast network was <b>switched</b> <b>off</b> gradually (by the digital-TV allotment regions) beginning on 26 January 2010. The process was completed, achieving digital switchover on 5 October 2010, but geographically isolated areas were left with analog broadcasts. The last analog TV transmitter in Croatia was shut down on 30 September 2011, as DVB-T coverage was extended to 98.5 percent of households in Croatia and no less than 95 percent of households {{in each of the}} allotment regions. Approximately 6,000 households were left with no reception of DVB-T or analog TV broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply <b>switched</b> <b>off</b> and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque {{can be obtained by}} adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.|$|E
5|$|To {{control the}} {{movement}} of the hydrogen and air within the envelope, the Patrie was equipped with five valves, some of which operated automatically, and others which could also be operated manually by the pilot via cords. The valves on the gas-bag released hydrogen automatically when the pressure exceeded two inches of water (inAq) (500Pa, 0.723psi); whereas the ballonet valves opened when the air pressure exceeded 0.78inAq (195Pa, 0.282psi), thus ensuring that air was driven out of the ballonet before there was any loss of hydrogen from the gas-bag. The automatic operation of the valves was a factor in the duration of its final (unmanned) flight (see Final flight section below). The pressure in the ballonet was maintained by an engine-driven fan, for which an electrical back-up was provided so that the pressures could be maintained {{in the event of an}} engine failure or when the engine had to be <b>switched</b> <b>off</b> for maintenance purposes.|$|E
