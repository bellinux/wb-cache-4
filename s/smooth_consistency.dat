2500|$|When {{raw milk}} is left {{standing}} for a while, it turns [...] "sour". This {{is the result}} of fermentation, where lactic acid bacteria ferment the lactose in the milk into lactic acid. Prolonged fermentation may render the milk unpleasant to consume. This fermentation process is exploited by the introduction of bacterial cultures (e.g. Lactobacilli sp., Streptococcus sp., Leuconostoc sp., etc.) to produce a variety of fermented milk products. The reduced pH from lactic acid accumulation denatures proteins and causes the milk to undergo a variety of different transformations in appearance and texture, ranging from an aggregate to <b>smooth</b> <b>consistency.</b> Some of these products include sour cream, yogurt, cheese, buttermilk, viili, kefir, and kumis.

50|$|After being caught, small shrimp are unloaded, {{rinsed and}} drained before being dried. Drying can be done on plastic mats {{on the ground in}} the sun, on metal beds on low stilts, or using other methods. After several days, the shrimp-salt mixture will darken and turn into a thick pulp. If the shrimp used to produce the paste were small, it is ready to be served as soon as the {{individual}} shrimp have broken-down beyond recognition. If the shrimp are larger, fermentation will take longer and the pulp will be ground to provide a <b>smoother</b> <b>consistency.</b> The fermentation/grinding process is usually repeated several times until the paste fully matures.

5000|$|True frozen custard {{is a very}} dense dessert. Soft serve {{ice creams}} may have an overrun as large as 100%, meaning half of the final product is {{composed}} of air. Frozen custard, when made in a proper continuous freezer will have an overrun of 15-30% depending on the machine manufacturer (an overrun percentage similar to gelato). Air is not pumped into the mix, nor is it added as an [...] "ingredient" [...] but gets into the frozen state by the agitation of liquid similar to whisking a meringue. The high percentage of butterfat and egg yolk gives frozen custard a thick, creamy texture and a <b>smoother</b> <b>consistency</b> than ice cream.

40|$|Aspects {{on the use}} of {{lactulose}} as {{a medication}} and probiotic food ingredient are discussed in the paper. The impact of lactulose syrup on the physico-chemical properties of yoghurt is considered as well as its synergetic and sensory characteristics, viscosity and changes during storage. Lactulose syrup was added to milk during the different stages of the technological process during which the syrup was added: prior to pasteurisation, prior to inoculation and after fermentation before cooling. Different impact on the viscosity of the product and its synergetic qualities was established depending on the stage of the technological process. The addition of lactulose syrup to milk prior to pasteurisation and inoculation increased the duration of fermentation. Samples of yoghurt containing lactulose had more pronounced sensory characteristics (richer flavour, <b>smoother</b> <b>consistency,</b> surface glaze, etc.) than those without lactulose. Lactulose syrup was found to have no impact on the changes in yoghurt during storage. Keywords: lactulose, prebiotics, yoghurt, physical chemical properties, viscosity, sensory characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Peptide {{identification}} from tandem {{mass spectrometry}} (MS/MS) data {{is one of}} the most important problems in computational proteomics. This technique relies heavily on the accurate assessment of the quality of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). However, current MS technology and PSM scoring algorithm are far from perfect, leading to the generation of incorrect peptide-spectrum pairs. Thus, it is critical to develop new post-processing techniques that can distinguish true identifications from false identifications effectively. Results In this paper, we present a consistency-based PSM re-ranking method to improve the initial identification results. This method uses one additional assumption that two peptides belonging to the same protein should be correlated to each other. We formulate an optimization problem that embraces two objectives through regularization: the <b>smoothing</b> <b>consistency</b> among scores of correlated peptides and the fitting consistency between new scores and initial scores. This optimization problem can be solved analytically. The experimental study on several real MS/MS data sets shows that this re-ranking method improves the identification performance. Conclusions The score regularization method can be used as a general post-processing step for improving peptide identifications. Source codes and data sets are available at: [URL]. </p...|$|R

Any canned fish - usually salmon or mackerel, {{although}} canned tuna is also used in some recipes (although the dish is often colloquially referred to as [...] "salmon croquettes" [...] or [...] "salmon patties" [...] regardless of the actual fish used) - is mashed by hand to break up any fish bones and give the fish meat a <b>smoother</b> <b>consistency,</b> then combined with a binder and various seasonings. Seasonings typically include pepper, salt, chopped (sometimes sautéed) onions, garlic, lemon juice or paprika. The binder can be any starch such as flour, cornmeal, matzo meal, ground crackers of any type, even white rice or oatmeal - although these latter variations are not as common, and are mostly limited to the northern U.S. Chopped eggs, parsley, and Parmesan cheese may also be added. The mixture is then shaped into rounded patties for pan- or deep-frying; corn or peanut oil are the most commonly used frying oils in the southern U.S., but canola, safflower, or olive oil are also used, and some recipes call specifically for pan-frying in butter or margarine.|$|R
