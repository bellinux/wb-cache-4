5|$|The {{development}} of the Seattle independent record label <b>Sub</b> Pop is tied closely to Soundgarden, since <b>Sub</b> Pop co-founder Jonathan Poneman funded Soundgarden's early releases, and the band's success led {{to the expansion of}} <b>Sub</b> Pop as a serious record label. Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was a fan of Soundgarden's music, and reportedly Soundgarden's involvement with <b>Sub</b> Pop influenced Cobain to sign Nirvana with the label. Cobain also stated that Soundgarden was one of the only Seattle bands that he liked along with Tad and Mudhoney. In rare footage in the 2015 documentary , Cobain can be seen impersonating Chris Cornell singing Outshined.|$|E

5|$|Caragiale {{also began}} work on the fragmentary writing Soborul țațelor ("The Council of Busibodies", 1929) and the detective story <b>Sub</b> pecetea tainei ("Under the Seal of Secrecy", 1930), but they would remain unfinished. In its first draft, <b>Sub</b> pecetea tainei was {{published}} by Gândirea in April 1930-April 1933, while Soborul țațelor was kept in three different variants. In a 1985 essay later published as a preface for <b>Sub</b> pecetea tainei, literary critic Nicolae Manolescu proposed that, while the story was not given a finishing touch, its plot was meant to seem ambiguous, and thus had led other commentators to wrongly assume that the text ended abruptly.|$|E
5|$|Congregation is {{the third}} studio album by American {{alternative}} rock band The Afghan Whigs, released on January 31, 1992, by <b>Sub</b> Pop. After touring {{for two years in}} support of their 1990 album Up in It, the band received $15,000 advance from <b>Sub</b> Pop to record a follow-up album. It was primarily recorded at Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville and Buzz's Kitchen in Los Angeles during July to August 1991. The band's frontman Greg Dulli produced the album entirely with audio engineer Ross Ian Stein. The album's production and release were hindered by <b>Sub</b> Pop's financial difficulties, which were eventually resolved by the massive commercial success of Nirvana's 1991 album Nevermind.|$|E
