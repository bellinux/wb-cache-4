25|$|Single- and double-engine engine flameouts {{plagued the}} program between June 1965 and July 1967, when fuel control {{problems}} were finally corrected. No aircraft were destroyed but one {{was out of}} service for six months after it crash-landed in a field near Albuquerque. By May 1968 <b>stress</b> <b>cracks</b> began appearing in the wing spars and ribs of all the RB-57Fs outboard of the main engines and numerous groundings forced the cancellation of many operational missions. Some aircraft were sent to General Dynamics for repairs but under Big Safari dicta the cost of repairing all of the aircraft was excessive and resulted in five being placed in storage at Davis-Monthan AFB in 1972 and another three in 1973. The remaining aircraft were retired in 1974. Each had accumulated on average a total of 3,000 hours of airframe life. The 58th WRS, the last squadron in the Air Force to use the WB-57F, was inactivated on 1 July 1974.|$|E
2500|$|Barris built two {{fiberglass}} {{copies of}} the original Batmobile for exhibition on the car show circuit and a third for exhibition drag racing. Eventually, the three copies (and the screen-used metal Futura Batmobile) were covered with a black velvet [...] "fuzz" [...] paint, presumably to hide <b>stress</b> <b>cracks</b> in the fiberglass bodies. [...] Later, all three were restored to their gloss black paint job. The three replicas are all based on a 1965–1966 Ford Galaxie. The #1 Barris-built Batmobile sold at Barrett-Jackson Auctions on January 19, 2013 for $4,620,000,. The three Barris copies all reside in private collections, including the exhibition drag racing version driven by wheelstanding driver Wild Bill Shrewsberry. This car was built with a dual-quad Holman Moody Ford 427 V8 engine, Art Carr-prepared Ford C6 automatic transmission and 5.14 gears in the rear end. Quarter-mile times were in the mid-12 second range, primarily because Shrewsberry would launch the car in second gear and smoke the overinflated rear tires for show down most of the strip. The [...] "rocket exhaust" [...] was made functional via a tank filled with either gasoline or kerosene which was pumped out the exhaust port and ignited electrically.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the most}} common form of grain damage is broken or cracked kernels. This is likely to happen during {{handling}} processes and anytime grain is moved from one place to another. The types of machinery used to handle grain and their effects on kernel damage will be discussed in further sections. The USDA lists the cutoffs for broken maize as anything that falls through a 12/64 round-hole sieve., and broken soybeans as anything that falls through an 8/64 round-hole sieve [...] These standards to do not directly account for any cracks that are present in the seed coat. These cracks in kernels are known to cause deterioration of the grain more quickly through accelerated insect and fungal infestation and a quicker susceptibility to breaking during further handling. [...] The allowable storage time for maize was found to decrease with an increase in mechanical damage (broken/cracked kernels). The storage time was found to decrease as mechanical damage increased from zero to forty percent. [...] With this research, it is necessary to attempt to minimize the amount of mechanical damage in grains. In addition to exterior cracks, <b>stress</b> <b>cracks</b> can form inside of the kernel. These <b>stress</b> <b>cracks</b> usually come from the combination of thermal and mechanical handling processes, such as drying. Kernels with internal <b>stress</b> <b>cracks</b> are found to have a higher breakage susceptibility and can break more quickly during further handling.|$|E

50|$|Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics yields {{reliable}} {{results in}} the field of ductile materials like steel. Most of the experiments and theories in fracture mechanics are formulated taking ductile materials as object of interest. But if we compare the salient features in LEFM with results derived from the testing of concrete, we may find it irrelevant and sometimes trivial. For example, LEFM permits infinite <b>stress</b> at <b>crack</b> tip. This makes no sense in real analysis of concrete where the <b>stress</b> at <b>crack</b> tip is fixed. And LEFM fails to calculate <b>stress</b> at <b>crack</b> tip precisely. So we need some other ways to find out what is <b>stress</b> at <b>crack</b> tip and distribution <b>stress</b> near <b>crack</b> tip.|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> {{resistance of}} halloysite nanoclay-polyester nanocomposites was investigated using fracture mechanics approach. The incorporation of halloysite nanoclay {{was found to}} improve the environmental <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> resistance of the nano-composites. The storage modulus of nano-composites measured by dynamic mechanical analysis increased remarkably {{as a function of}} halloysite nanoclay content. At 0. 7 wt% nanoclay, the Tg improved from 72 °C to 76 °C. The fracture toughness increased up to 33 % and time to failure improved 155 % with the addition of 0. 7 wt% of halloysite nanoclay. The maximum microhardness was found 119 % higher for the same nano-filler concentration compared to monolithic polyester. The reinforcement with 1 wt% showed lower fracture toughness due to agglomerations of nanoclay which act as flaws. The presence of agglomerates weakened the bond between nano-particles and matrix hence reduces the environmental <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> resistance by halloysite nanoclay reinforcement...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} current {{understanding}} of the mechanisms of <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracking</b> of pipeline steels. The similarities, the differences and the influencing factors are considered for the high pH <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracking</b> caused by a concentrated bicarbonate-carbonate solution, and for the low pH <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracking</b> due to a diluter solution. For high pH <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracking,</b> it is well accepted that the mechanism involves anodic dissolution for crack initiation and propagation.

But the precise influence of hydrogen on the mechanism needs to be further studied. (C) 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|R

40|$|The <b>stress</b> {{corrosion}} <b>crack</b> {{is one of}} {{the fracture}} phenomena for the major structure components in nuclear power plant. During the operation of a power plant, <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracks</b> are initiated and grown especially in dissimilar weldment of primary loop components. In particular, <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>crack</b> usually occurs when the following three factors exist at the same time: susceptible material, corrosive environment, and tensile stress (residual stress included). Thus, residual stress becomes a critical factor for <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>crack</b> when it is difficult to improve the material corrosivity of the components and their environment under operating conditions. In this study, <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracks</b> were artificially produced on STS 304 pipe itself by control of welding residual stress. We used the instrumented indentation technique and 3 D FEM analysis (using ANSYS 12) to evaluate the residual stress values in the GTAW area. We used the custom-made device for fabricating the <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>crack</b> in the inner STS 304 pipe wall. As the result of both FEM analysis and experiment, the <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>crack</b> was quickly generated and could be reproduced, and it could be controlled by welding residual stress...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research has been concerned with investigating <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> phenomena which occur when thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU's) are immersed in seawater at low temperatures. The investigation was concerned with testing the following hypothesis: a) that cracking of TPU was due to environmental <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> (ESC) and/or b) due to structure and morphology changes which occur during the ageing period. The combined effects of polyurethane chemical backbone, domain structure and crystallinity on <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> in TPU were studied. Further, the investigation concerned itself with studying, on <b>stress</b> <b>cracking,</b> the effects of storage conditioning the TPU granules prior to processing, the processing conditions and various postcuring treatments of TPU. Characterisation and analytical techniques employed to study the structure of TPU's investigated consisted of thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction. Molecular weight distribution was studied by gel permeation chromatography and solution viscosity techniques. Processing'was evaluated by melt flow index (MFI), injection moulding and extrusion. A new accelerated ageing test for environmental <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> has been developed which uses high pressures. Also, {{a new type of}} ESC chemical class of reagent which relates the hydrogen bonding parameter of the ESC agent to that of the TPU's has been discovered and a theory developed. A test method has been designed to measure, in active environments, the existence of a critical strain for all the TPU examined whether commercial or laboratory synthesised materials. Results show that the <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> in TPU's is due to the following events: (a) a large reduction in molecular weight due to the processing, and (b) the combined effects of applied stresses and the hydrolysis of the polymer. Molecular weight reduction in TPU's and their resistance to ESe was also found dependent on the preconditioning history of unprocessed TPU granules, as well as any postcuring operations applied to the processed materials. It has been established that, the ESe resistance of TPU's can be improved by (i) optimising processing conditions, (ii) by insertion of slight crosslinking or by selecting certain types of diisocyanates, specifically p phenylene diisocyanate, and trans 1, 4 -cyclohexane diisocyanate. A mechanism to explain ESe of TPU's inactive and mild environments is also proposed...|$|R
