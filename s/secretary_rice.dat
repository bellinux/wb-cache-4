5000|$|Two years ago, I {{criticized the}} Secretary of State for {{the firing of}} U.S. Ambassador to Armenia, John Evans, after he {{properly}} used the term genocide to describe Turkey's slaughter of thousands of Armenians starting in 1915. I shared with <b>Secretary</b> <b>Rice</b> my firmly held conviction that the Armenian Genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence. The facts are undeniable. An official policy that calls on diplomats to distort the historical facts is an untenable policy. As a senator, I strongly support passage of the Armenian Genocide Resolution (H.Res.106 and S.Res.106), and as President I will recognize the Armenian Genocide.|$|E
