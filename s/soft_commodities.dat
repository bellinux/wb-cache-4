25|$|A {{commodity}} {{market is a}} market that trades in primary economic sector rather than manufactured products. <b>Soft</b> <b>commodities</b> are agricultural products such as wheat, coffee, cocoa, fruit and sugar. Hard commodities are mined, such as gold and oil. Investors access about 50 major {{commodity market}}s worldwide with purely financial transactions increasingly outnumbering physical trades in which goods are delivered. Futures contracts are the oldest way of investing in commodities. Futures are secured by physical assets. Commodity markets can include physical trading and derivatives trading using spot prices, forwards, futures, and options on futures. Farmers have used a simple form of derivative trading in the commodity market for centuries for price risk management.|$|E

The objective {{of the project was}} to provide econometric analysis and theory for modelling energy and <b>soft</b> <b>commodity</b> prices. This necessitated data analysis and modelling together with theoretical econometrics, dealing with the specific stylised facts of commodity prices. In order to analyse energy and <b>soft</b> <b>commodity</b> prices, the determination of spot energy prices in regulated markets was first considered, {{from the point of view}} of the regulator. Direct data analysis of futures commodity prices was then undertaken, resulting in the collection of an extensive dataset of most traded futures commodity prices at a daily frequency, covering 16 different commodities over a 10 -year period. Main Topics : The commodities covered include electricity, oil, gas and other commodities, including coffee, cocoa, sugar, cereal and pulse crops.

50|$|In contrast, a {{perishable}} or <b>soft</b> <b>commodity</b> {{does not}} allow this arbitrage - the cost of storage is effectively higher than the expected future price of the commodity. As a result, spot prices will reflect current supply and demand, not future price movements. Spot prices can therefore be quite volatile and move independently from forward prices. According to the unbiased forward hypothesis, {{the difference between these}} prices will equal the expected price change of the commodity over the period.|$|R
50|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>commodities</b> play a {{major part}} in the futures market. They are used by farmers wishing to lock-in the future prices of their crops, by {{commercial}} purchasers of the products, and by speculative investors seeking a profit.

40|$|Global {{production}} of food, feed, fiber, and bio-based fuel commodities {{is essential to}} economic development and human well-being. These ‘soft’ commodities, so named because they are grown and not mined (WWF, 2012 a), support basic human needs and sustain a growing population and economy. However, trends indicate that natural ecosystems are unable to support projected global demand for resources, and are already under strain from increasing consumption, dietary shifts, a rising middle class, and overall economic growth (WWF, 2012 b). This suggests that the future will see increasing market price volatility, changes in production and consumption patterns, and unpredictable supply chain shocks within the <b>soft</b> <b>commodity</b> market. These changes will ripple throughout the business sector, governments, and civil society with profound economic, social, and environmental consequences. In the face of increasing uncertainty in <b>soft</b> <b>commodity</b> markets, businesses have a strong incentive to enhance the sustainability of their supply chains. Indeed, a long-term sustaining business model and natural resource conservation are often strongly intertwined. As freshwater becomes scarcer, for example, apparel manufacturers will face supply pressures and rising prices for thirsty cotton, while freshwater species will experience severe habitat degradation and loss. Overfishing will both harm the long-term prospects of companies sourcing fish products and result in significant loss of biodiversity. These examples illustrate that businesses and conservation groups would be well-served to identify where their goals overlap, and to work in partnership toward achieving those goals for mutual benefit...|$|R

40|$|This thesis offers a comprehensive view {{of coffee}} trading on {{commodity}} markets. To describe {{the behavior of}} prices and their volatility, ARCH and GARCH models are used.

The thesis connects the characteristics of <b>soft</b> <b>commodity</b> with current knowledge of financial econometrics.

Price volatility is examined with regard to deregulation and reforms on this market within the last three decades. Developments in the developing world caused a significant need for the progression and identification with the hedging instruments. These are closely linked to the globalized market with coffee, so it is conversely possible to absorb the shocks on small growers, who are significantly impacted by the globalized world...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. M. (Finance & Investment)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, Graduate School of Business Administration, 2013. Recent {{unexpected}} {{variability in}} the earnings of agribusinesses in South Africa has led stakeholders to ask as to why projected financial performance tended to be {{so different from the}} actual results achieved. This paper aims to make an empirical contribution to the discussion on the effects of <b>soft</b> <b>commodity</b> price volatility on the returns of entities whose major business involves derivatives trading in agricultural commodity products. Firstly, mathematical models for commodity price volatility are determined for the major agricultural commodities on the South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX) using the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and the generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) type of approaches. Secondly, the study then seeks to ascertain whether there are causality links between the commodity price volatility and the returns or earnings realised by selected agribusinesses over time. The paper then discusses some trading strategies that are applicable given that commodity price volatility can be forecasted using the statistical models identified under the study...|$|R

It is also in a stable of agricultural and bioenergy newsletters and conferences at AgraNet.

However, values of assets are also determined by other business fundamentals, company’s and world events, human psychology, and investors’ belief about the possible future profit. In recent history that lead to an increase of individual and institutional investors’ interest in allocating their resources in commodity markets. With a large inflow of capital commodities’ prices started to rise making them attractive components to effective investment portfolios. The presented paper addresses the issue of so called commodities ‘financialization’ process. It looks at the main factors standing behind commodities’ price movements and to what extent financial market participants contributed to commodities price volatility in recent years. Based on the data examined it distinguishes the involvement of both commercial and non-commercial traders in short and long term periods of time. As well as explaining the impact of growing investors’ interest in commodity markets it defines other market forces - like currency appreciations and emerging markets - as being part of increased volatility in raw and <b>soft</b> <b>commodity</b> markets. Along with market examination the paper focuses on possible future outcomes in attempts to regulate commodities derivatives markets and potential effects of those efforts...|$|R
