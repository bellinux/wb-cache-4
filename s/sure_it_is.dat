5|$|Within an {{environment}} characterized by low wind shear, high atmospheric humidity, and warm sea surface temperatures, Earl intensified, reaching a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) by 0600UTC on August15. Initial forecasts from the National Hurricane Center depicted gradual intensification into a powerful hurricane {{as the system}} entered the central Caribbean Sea, but these forecasts were lowered in later advisories. Despite an impressive satellite presentation associated with Earl as it passed through the southern Leeward Islands, a hurricane hunter flight reported that the system {{no longer had a}} low-level circulation late on August15. As a result, the NHC discontinued advisories on the system and declared it an open tropical wave. While not entirely <b>sure,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> suspected that the fast motion of the cyclone attributed to its dissipation. The remnant wave eventually entered the eastern Pacific Ocean, developing into Hurricane Frank by August23.|$|E

25|$|In general, idic(15) occurs de novo but {{the parents}} must be karyotyped to make <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not inherited, mostly because this {{will affect the}} course of genetic {{counseling}} given to the family. If the abnormality is found prenatally {{and one of the}} parents harbour the marker, the child has a chance of not carrying the mutation. Further tests should however be done to prove the marker has not been rearranged while being inherited. This information is also necessary for counseling of future pregnancies. Each family is unique and should therefore be handled individually.|$|E
25|$|When Pat {{gets home}} {{and tries to}} tell Sara {{about the fact that}} the honeymoon is {{cancelled}} because the new boss has cancelled all bonuses, his son Julian (voiced by Sandra Teles) shows Pat a TV talent show, You're the One, hosted by Simon Cowbell (voiced by Robin Atkin Downes in typical Simon Cowell voice), which states the next auditions are coming to Greendale. Cowbell also confirms that the person who wins the contest will be awarded a holiday to Italy and a recording contract. Pat decides to take part in the contest and his unexpected singing voice (played by Ronan Keating) wins the contest. Pat is to sing again in the finale, in a head-to-head contest with the winner of another heat, Josh (voiced by Rupert Grint). His manager, Wilf (voiced by David Tennant), however, is very keen to make <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> his client who wins at all costs.|$|E
25|$|The {{law clerk}} Mr. Guppy, enamoured of Esther, hopes {{to win her}} affection by helping her {{discover}} the identity of her parents. He finds connections to both Lady Dedlock and the deceased Nemo, who {{has been identified as}} Captain James Hawdon, and is eventually alerted to the existence of letters left behind by Hawdon but kept by his drunken landlord, Krook. Realizing that Esther is her daughter whom she was told had died — fathered by Hawdon before her current marriage — Lady Dedlock confesses to Esther but swears her to secrecy. Esther is stricken by smallpox and nearly dies; she recovers but is terribly scarred. John proposes marriage to Esther, but though she accepts, he convinces her to keep it secret until she is <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> what she wants. While amassing other enemies, Tulkinghorn deduces Lady Dedlock's secret and tries to use it to keep her in line.|$|E

500|$|Accompanied by Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams and 16 policemen, Shippard {{arrived in}} mid-October 1888. The king {{suspended}} concession negotiations {{in favour of}} meetings with him. The colonial official told the king that the Boers were hungry for more land and intended to overrun his country before too long; he also championed Rudd's cause, telling Lobengula that Rudd's team acted {{on behalf of a}} powerful, financially formidable organisation supported by Queen Victoria. Meanwhile, Rhodes sent a number of letters to Rudd, warning him that Maund was his main rival, and that because the London syndicate's goals overlapped so closely with their own, it was essential that Cawston and Gifford be defeated or else brought into the Rhodes camp. Regarding Lobengula, Rhodes advised Rudd to make the king think that the concession would work for him. [...] "Offer a steamboat on the Zambezi same as [...] Stanley put on the Upper Congo...

Even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to the Indians, even as there was a feeling of {{what it meant to be}} a man, what it meant to have some sense of duty.... Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.|$|E

500|$|Rebellion {{was given}} {{materials}} from the film's production, including footage and the full script, in order to recreate {{the feel of the}} film and lend authenticity to the game. The game's plot is loosely based on the film's, with the player character working to remove traces of Alien and Predator presence in a small American town. Despite similarities to the movie, the ending is different and the game does not feature the [...] "predalien", a Predator-Alien hybrid introduced in Alien vs. Predator. The directors of the film, the Brothers Strause, are fans of Rebellion's PC Aliens vs. Predator game and worked with the studio to develop Aliens vs. Predator: Requiems premise. In an interview with IGN, Rebellion's Tim Jones said [...] "Fox is very protective of their franchise and take [...] great care to make <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> treated properly. We had to work within strict confines to remain consistent with the movie and everything we did had to be approved by the studio." [...] The game's system of honor points was considered crucial by Rebellion, who felt that the Predators, despite being the [...] "bad guys", were characterized by a strict code of honor.|$|E
500|$|Doctor Who had {{previously}} aired two related specials for Comic Relief. The {{first was the}} 1999 spoof The Curse of Fatal Death, which was also written by Steven Moffat. The spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures produced its own mini-episode [...] "From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love" [...] for the 2009 Comic Relief appeal. Unlike The Curse of Fatal Death, [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] {{are considered to be}} canonical. The canonicity of the two mini-episodes was affirmed by Moffat in Doctor Who Magazine. Moffat stated that, unlike Curse of the Fatal Death, [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] is not a spoof or a sketch, but rather [...] "a little miniature story" [...] {{in the style of the}} Children in Need mini-episodes. He described it as [...] "A moment of life aboard the TARDIS. But obviously life about the TARDIS instantly gets you into terrible jeopardy, and all of causality is threatened. As I'm <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> every day when they get up and have their coffee..." [...] The concept of a TARDIS inside the TARDIS had been previously explored in The Time Monster (1972) and Logopolis (1980), though both times it was the TARDIS of the Master. Amy also repeats one of her lines from [...] "The Big Bang" [...] at the end of [...] "Space".|$|E
500|$|Mosquito nets {{help keep}} {{mosquitoes}} {{away from people}} and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria. Nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time {{to find a way}} past the net. Insecticide-treated nets are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net. Between 2000 and 2008, the use of ITNs saved the lives of an estimated 250,000 infants in Sub-Saharan Africa. About 13% of households in Sub-Saharan countries owned ITNs in 2007 and 31% of African households were estimated to own at least one ITN in 2008. In 2000, 1.7 million (1.8%) African children living in areas of the world where malaria is common were protected by an ITN. That number increased to 20.3 million (18.5%) African children using ITNs in 2007, leaving 89.6 million children unprotected and to 68% African children using mosquito nets in 2015. [...] Most nets are impregnated with pyrethroids, a class of insecticides with low toxicity. They are most effective when used from dusk to dawn.

500|$|... "This Is It" [...] is a pop ballad with {{a simple}} mid-tempo {{keyboard}} that lasts three minutes and thirty-six seconds. The song begins with Jackson singing, “This is it, here I stand / I’m {{the light of the}} world, I feel grand / Got this love I can feel / And I know yes for <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> real” and then he tenderly hits his signature high notes about a new lover he feels he’s known [...] "since 1,000 years." [...] Jackson's brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon (credited as The Jacksons) are featured as background vocals throughout the song. Background music includes fingersnaps, a [...] "soaring chorus," [...] big-build strings and [...] "bubbly guitars." [...] The song is played in the key of Bb major. Throughout the song, Jackson's vocal range spans from F4 to C6. The song's tempo is moderate, and its metronome speed is 96 beats per minute. According to the music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing and the Winnipeg Sun, the song is written in common time. The lyrics [...] "toggle between grandiosity" [...] ("This is it, here I stand / I'm the light of the world, I feel grand") and [...] "shy, romantic yearning" [...] ("I never heard a single word about you / Falling in love wasn't my plan"). Darrly Sterdan of the Winnipeg Sun felt that Jackson's voice and the background music sounded [...] "like a demo that's been fleshed out with overdubs and doowoppy backup vocals from his brothers." [...] Anthony McCartney, of the Associated Press felt that the finger-snap percussion [...] "echoes" [...] that present in Jackson's 1982 song [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] with Paul McCartney.|$|E
