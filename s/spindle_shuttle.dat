William Holman Hunt's painting from the poem (illustration, right) contrasts the completely pattern-woven interior with the sunlit world reflected in the roundel mirror. On the wall, woven representations of Myth ("Hesperides") and Religion ("Prayer") echo the mirror's open roundel; the tense and conflicted Lady of Shalott stands imprisoned within the brass roundel of her loom, while outside the passing knight sings [...] "'Tirra lirra' by the river" [...] as in Tennyson's poem.|$|E

40|$|Swedish weavers {{who arrived}} in the United States in the early 20 th century before World War I found hand weaving a dying art in the United States, but their own skills were valued. American textile mills {{produced}} inexpensive and vast quantities of fabrics, {{but there was also}} growing interest in reviving the lost arts and crafts of the Colonial and pioneer eras. Influence from the European Arts and Crafts movement and the Bauhaus design philosophy was growing in modern America. These factors created new opportunities for a revival of hand weaving. Sweden, by contrast, had retained its strong craft tradition in the face of late-arriving industrialization. A system of preservation societies and craft training in the folk (free public) schools and in arts and crafts schools in Sweden meant that such skills were widely known and valued. For Americans interested in weaving in the early 20 th century, Sweden and Swedish sources became an important source of knowledge, equipment, tools, yarns, books and personal instruction. Swedish weavers taught fine, traditional weaving in several American craft communities, art centers, schools and colleges prior to WWII. Some Americans visited Sweden and other Scandinavian countries in search of weaving education and inspiration, a cross-cultural experience that continues, enhanced by computer access. This study highlights Swedish weavers whose presence was featured in American weaving and craft publications and organizations.

40|$|Men of the Thar Desert in the Indian {{states of}} Rajasthan and Gujarat and the Pakistan state of Sindh {{have been the}} {{traditional}} masters of ply-split braiding. They have focused on trappings for camels, including elaborately decorated girths, bridles and other accoutrement, made of goat hair or cotton. Particularly since the 1998 publication of Collingwood’s The Techniques of Ply-split Braiding, fiber artists have explored other possibilities for using ply-split braiding to create vessels and other three-dimensional structures. Most of those innovations {{have been done in}} what Collingwood calls single-course oblique twining (SCOT), which allows great freedom in color patterning because where cords of contrasting color meet, either can be chosen as the surface color. Plain oblique twining (POT) is more constraining, as a given cord alternately splits and is split by the cords it meets along its path. A recentpaper in <b>Shuttle,</b> <b>Spindle</b> 2 ̆ 6 Dyepot documented novel cord sequences that allow a variety of POT vessels to be made with orthogonally oriented cords (which Speiser calls course parallel). The current report describes a very different set of possibilities when POT vessels are made with diagonally oriented cords (course oblique). Particularly notable in these course-oblique POT vessels are opportunities for combining solid and fenestrated surfaces, varying sizes and relations of fenestrations to shape vessels, creatingfootings or handles that are integral to the vessel, and using cord substitution to create blocks of color with complex junctures. David W. Fraser’s textile interests center on structures that are not readily mechanized and the cultures in which they have importance. He has pursued these interests as both scholar and practitioner. His scholarship has included the study of weft twining across cultures and time and (with Barbara Fraser) an acclaimed exploration of the backstrap loom-woven textiles of the Chin peoples of South and Southeast Asia. His artistic work in recent years has focused on ply-split braiding. Building on the work of the late Peter Collingwood, he has designed new cord sequences to permit construction of a variety of novel vessels with radial symmetry. He is a Research Associate at The Textile Museum and a Juried Member of the Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen. www. fraserfiber. co...|$|R
