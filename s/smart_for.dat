However, Smart stopped responding to either of these assaults. Soon after, Hill ended his attacks with the final shot in December 1752.|$|E

In the first 90-second clip, April seeks beauty contestant advice from Leslie, who tells her to act differently from her usual behavior. While awaiting the talent contest, April lists a number of her unusual talents, including inventing emoticons, convincing her mother she is adopted, instantly making security guards suspicious and determining if someone is fat or pregnant [...] "with 60 percent accuracy". In the second 1-minute and 15 second clip, Ann tries to explain to Mark she is not hinting at sex when she asks him to [...] "fix her shower", and Sanderson talks about his insecurities, including that Leslie might be too <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> him.

500|$|After Marker saw Manson's group Angelfish on 120 Minutes, {{the band}} {{invited her to}} Vig and Marker's Smart Studios to sing {{on a couple of}} songs, but after a [...] "dreadful" [...] first audition, she {{returned}} to Angelfish. Manson eventually returned to <b>Smart</b> <b>for</b> a successful second time, where she began to work on the then-skeletal [...] "Queer", [...] "Vow" [...] and [...] "Stupid Girl". Working on the lyrics, [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] became an [...] "anthem for a girl who won't settle for less than what she wants". Later she added, [...] " [...] really about squandering potential, [...] our version of Madonna's 'Express Yourself', but a little more subversive". Manson aimed the song as a rebuke towards a friend's foolish behaviour: [...] "A lot of females still find it difficult to find their own voice in society. It's just that women have a different set of problems from men... make the most of your potential." [...] Manson added that [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] was [...] "a song of reproach {{to a lot of people}} we know", both male and female, and that [...] "we could have called it 'Stupid Guy,' but we thought another song about a strident female dissing a guy would be tedious." ...|$|E

500|$|Following a {{trial at}} the club, Gill signed for Cheltenham Town on 25 February 2004 on a non-{{contract}} basis {{until the end}} of the season. He was given a one-year contract for the 2004–05 season and, at the age of 34, played in all 46 league games; he believed that all the fitness work he did during rehabilitation from his knee injury had given him a new lease of life. Gill acted as regular deputy when club captain John Finnigan was unavailable through injury. For the following season, he was given another one-year contract, with an option for 2006–07 if he managed to play 20 games during the season. Not only did he start twice that number, he contributed to the club reaching the final of the League Two play-offs at the Millennium Stadium. His starting place and winners' medal, achieved with the help of his [...] "excellent last-ditch defending", went some way to alleviate the disappointment of missing the 2001 League Cup final. In addition, his sales experience enabled the players to look <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> the occasion; expecting to be wearing tracksuits for their big day because the club was unable to afford a set of new suits, Gill persuaded a local outfitters to supply a set of suits at reasonable cost. While at Cheltenham Town he became a fan favourite and even had a song created by the fans who jokingly sung about his less than impressive goal scoring abilities, [...] "If Jerry scores, We're on the pitch, if Jerry scores, We're on the pitch!" [...] to the tune of Tom Hark.|$|E
500|$|Justin Ravitz of PopMatters {{called the}} series a [...] "cleverly trashy postmodern soap" [...] and {{credited}} it for reviving {{the soap opera}} genre, which he felt had disappeared but still suited American culture. He compared the pilot to Sex and the City, declaring it [...] "could potentially replace the departed Sex as the TV Sunday ritual for women and gay men everywhere, although DH is the guiltier pleasure of the two." [...] However, he noted the contrasting tones and dynamics between the two series, and stated that the friendships between Desperate Housewives four leading women seemed [...] "tenuous," [...] opining, [...] "the sisterly, sugar-swapping connection between the surviving women is superficial, and clearly vulnerable to shifting alliances, acts of betrayal and crowd-pleasing cat-fights." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety called the pilot [...] "oodles of fun." [...] He complimented the cast, stating that while Hatcher provides [...] "the emotional core" [...] of the series, [...] "nearly everyone is intriguing {{in one way or}} another," [...] and predicted that Eva Longoria would become the show's breakout star. However, Lowry noted that Desperate Housewives may be [...] "a little too <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> its own good" [...] and expressed concern over the series' [...] "soapy elements." [...] Tom Shales of The Washington Post praised the pilot, assessing, [...] "In visual style, witty language, borderline surrealism and overall mad attitude, [...] stands on a mountaintop all its own, the best new drama of the season and perhaps the best new comedy, too." [...] He complimented Cross and Hatcher's performances, as well as the writing for the Mary Alice character's narrations. The Futon Critic selected the pilot as the 26th best television episode of 2004.|$|E

2500|$|During April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen {{discussed}} the [...] "Paradox of deleveraging" [...] described by economist Hyman Minsky: [...] "Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take {{long before we}} were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vig invited Manson to Smart Studios to sing on {{a couple}} of tracks. After an {{unsuccessful}} audition, she returned to Angelfish. Manson admitted she felt intimidated showcasing herself to Vig, who produced bands she admired such as Nirvana, Sonic Youth, and The Smashing Pumpkins, and Vig added that the audition's disorganized nature along with the Americans not understanding Manson's Scottish accent caused communication problems. At the end of the Live tour, Angelfish imploded and Manson returned to <b>Smart</b> <b>for</b> a second try. She began to work on the then-skeletal origins of some songs and the band invited her to become a full-time member and finish the album; she co-wrote and co-produced the entire album {{with the rest of the}} band. In August 1994, Radioactive gave their permission for Manson to work with Garbage. The band's debut album Garbage was released in August 1995, and went on to sell over 4 million copies, buoyed by a run of high charting singles including [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] and [...] "Stupid Girl." [...] Manson quickly became the public face of the band over the course of a tour that took the band through to the end of 1996. Echo & the Bunnymen had asked Manson to sing on their 1997 comeback album.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the last}} quarter of the 17th century, the {{population}} of Birmingham was somewhere between 4,000 and 15,000. Birmingham's small arms manufacture continued and during the mid-to-late 17th century Birmingham smiths were renowned for their manufacture of quality weapons (Alexander Missen in his Travels on visiting Milan noted that [...] "fine works of rock-crystal, swords, heads of canes, snuffboxes, and other fine works of steel" [...] could be purchased in Milan but that [...] "they can be had better and cheaper in Birmingham"). There is no evidence that firearms were manufactured in Birmingham until the 1690s when the Office of Ordinance issued a warrant to [...] "pay John <b>Smart</b> <b>for</b> Thomas Hadley, and the rest of the Gunmakers of Birmingham, one debenture of four-score [...] and sixteen pounds eight shillings, dated ye 14th of July 1690", but it is unlikely that guns were not manufactured in Birmingham before that date. It is more likely that when Sir Richard Newdigate approached manufacturers in the town in 1689 with the notion of supplying the British Government with small arms, it was important that they would need to be of high enough calibre to equal the small arms that were imported from abroad. After a successful trial order in 1692, the Government placed its first contract. On 5 January 1693 the [...] "Officers of Ordnance" [...] chose five local firearms manufacturers to initially produce 200 [...] "snaphance musquets" [...] per month over the period of one year, paying 17 shillings per musket, plus 3 shillings per hundredweight for delivery to London.|$|E

So it's a happy bonus to find that Despicable Me is more than just a heat-busting baby-sitter." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying, [...] "This is a smartly written comedy with a soft emotional core." [...] Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film three out of four stars, saying, [...] "Despicable Me may not be the most sophisticated kids movie ever, but it stacks up against recent animated fare like How To Train Your Dragon the way The New York Review of Books compares to USA Today."

[...] Den of Geek rated Quan Chi 26th in their 2015 ranking of the franchise's 73 playable characters, calling him [...] "the true evil mastermind of the MK universe" [...] who [...] "suffers from the writers trying to make him a little too slick and <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> his own good." [...] In 2010, Game Informer named Quan Chi as a character they wanted for the reboot: [...] "Many of the characters introduced post-MK3 were forgettable, but Quan Chi stood out as one of the more interesting." [...] However, Nic Rowen of Destructoid gave a harsher opinion of the character: [...] "Quan Chi is a dark sorcerer shitbag that nobody likes, both in the fandom and in the series' narrative [...] unsuccessfully scheming behind the back of whatever master he is currently serving like an incompetent, bald Starscream." [...] Fans ranked Quan Chi as the 29th-best character in a 2013 online poll held by Dorkly that rated the entire Mortal Kombat roster, and eliminated him in the lower rounds in the annual [...] "Supreme Mortal Kombat Champion" [...] polls hosted by Mortal Kombat Online, losing to Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Jade, respectively.|$|E
