5|$|Problems {{with water}} quality {{in some of}} the former Manchester Docks basins became {{apparent}} with the redevelopment of Salford Quays. Years of runoff from sewers and roads had accumulated in the <b>slow</b> <b>running</b> waters of this area and decomposition of organic matter was causing oxygen depletion. In 2001, a compressed air injection system was introduced. This raised the oxygen levels in the water by up to 300%, improving the water quality {{to such an extent that}} the number of invertebrate species present, like freshwater shrimp, increased by more than30. Spawning and growth rates of fish species such as roach and perch have also increased, and are now amongst the highest in England.|$|E

In {{addition}} to his <b>slow</b> <b>running,</b> Richardson was also noted for developing (in conjunction with the Beige Brigade) a tradition to challenge the slowest runner of the opposing side to a running race {{at the conclusion of}} each tour. In his first race he beat Australia's Darren Lehmann. He has since raced Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, South Africa's Neil McKenzie and England's Ashley Giles, only beating Kaneria. The Beige Brigade also supplied Richardson with a long-sleeved and hooded running suit in the New Zealand teams 1980s beige and brown colours.|$|E

Three algorithms (AC, RS, GA) work in reasonable time for data sets of size N[*]=[*] 5000 but require already several minutes for the Birch sets of size N[*]=[*] 100, 000.

50|$|Kaeser’s design {{philosophy}} {{remains to}} develop larger, <b>slower</b> <b>running</b> airends.

500|$|Willis {{returned}} to England in January 1975 with a recurring knee injury which had {{caused him to}} collapse at a county game early that season, and underwent several operations to correct it. He had surgery on both knees, and suffered a post-operative blood clot. He was forced to use crutches {{for most of the}} season, and reflected in 1978 that it was [...] "similar to a 50,000-mile service." [...] His recovery was particularly tortuous, requiring daily runs around the cricket field and an intensive gym program under the supervision of Dr. Arthur Jackson, an advocate of <b>slow</b> <b>running</b> therapy to build stamina. He played no part in the international arena in 1975, and managed only four first-class appearances, though these returned a healthy 18 wickets at 18.77. He was not to return to the Test game until 1976, where he faced the West Indies in two matches in July and August.|$|E
500|$|Jack Horner and Don Lessem {{argued in}} 1993 that Tyrannosaurus {{was slow and}} {{probably}} could not run (no airborne phase in mid-stride). However, Holtz (1998) concluded that tyrannosaurids and their close relatives were the fastest large theropods. Christiansen (1998) estimated that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , {{which is about the}} speed of a human sprinter. Farlow and colleagues (1995) have argued that a 6-8ton Tyrannosaurus would have been critically or even fatally injured if it had fallen while moving quickly, since its torso would have slammed into the ground at a deceleration of 6g (six times the acceleration due to gravity, or about 60meters/s²) and its tiny arms could not have reduced the impact. However, giraffes have been known to gallop at 50km/h (31mph), despite the risk that they might break a leg or worse, which can be fatal even in a [...] "safe" [...] environment such as a zoo. Thus {{it is quite possible that}} Tyrannosaurus also moved fast when necessary and had to accept such risks; this scenario has been studied for Allosaurus too. Most recent research on Tyrannosaurus locomotion does not narrow down speeds further than a range from , i.e. from walking or <b>slow</b> <b>running</b> to moderate-speed running. A computer model study in 2007 estimated running speeds, based on data taken directly from fossils, and claimed that T. rex had a top running speed of [...] (probably a juvenile individual).|$|E
