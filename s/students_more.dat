40|$|The {{present study}} is an attempt made to examine the issue related to reading habits of {{professional}} and non professional students. The issues studied are their dependency on libraries. items that they read, problems encountered by them and so no. A total of 116 students (56 professionals and 60 non-professionals) served as the sample for the present study. The data was collected by questionnaire. MANOVA ware applied {{to find out the}} difference between course type and gender on various issues.

Professional <b>students</b> had <b>more</b> interest in employment and value based, and non-professional <b>students</b> were <b>more</b> interested on entertainment, science and technology and International affairs. Professional <b>students</b> had <b>more</b> frequency of reading in business newspapers and subject journals; whereas non-professional <b>students</b> had <b>more</b> frequency of reading general magazines. Professional <b>students</b> had <b>more</b> problems related to reading like smoking & other habits, hetero sexual interests, family problems, part-time work. library oriented teaching. parental conflict, illiteracy of parents, emotional imbalance, and poverty & rural areas, than non-professional students. Gender-wise comparisons revealed that male <b>students</b> were <b>more</b> dependent on home libraries and female <b>students</b> were <b>more</b> dependent on public libraries. Male <b>students</b> were <b>more</b> interested in employment and value based items, whereas female <b>students</b> were <b>more</b> interested in political, international and agricultural and environment related items. Male <b>students</b> were <b>more</b> reading business and online readings whereas female <b>students</b> were <b>more</b> reading general newspapers. Problems encountered in reading habit for male students are smoking, part-time work, education system and emotional imbalance. Suggestions to improve readinghabits are also discussed...|$|R
