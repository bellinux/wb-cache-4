The objective of a thesis is to implement the new functionality into the existing program. At the beginning we present time zone files, zoneinfo directory and PSM application. Finally, we connect all these knowledge together by producing graphical interface for time zone files in PSM application. Graphical user interface was developed in Java and all <b>settings</b> <b>files</b> have a XML structure. We also described program zic, which converts source code of time zone files to regular and correct time zone files and PSM system. The result is working graphical user interface for choosing time zone files and transfer of selected file to device. Therefore all the devices in NEO 3000 family {{around the world will}} be able to produce correct time stamps...|$|E
40|$|Users {{interested}} in customizing their Primo installation {{are required to}} configure specific <b>settings,</b> <b>files,</b> and code during the View setup process. A consequence {{of this is that}} unique customizations are not easily sharable between institutions. With the release of the new Primo User Interface, Ex Libris has enabled institutions to manage interface customizations via the Package Customization Manager. In the summer of 2016, an Orbis Cascade Alliance working group investigated the efficacy of the Package Manager as a means of centrally sharing and deploying Orbis Cascade Alliance Primo Toolkit customizations. By virtue of passively loading customizations to the central package, each institution could pass custom parameters with local JS in order to adapt central customizations to the specific needs of that institution’s users. This article will address both the potential and the limitations of the Primo Package Customization Manager. It will also provide best practices for consortia seeking to centrally manage and share Primo enhancements and it will identify areas of future development for centrally shared customizations...|$|E
40|$|Ocean Data View (ODV) is a {{computer}} program for the interactive analysis and visualization of oceanographic and other geo-referenced profile, trajectory or time-series data. The software is available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and UNIX systems. ODV data and <b>settings</b> <b>files</b> are platform independent and can be exchanged between all supported systems. ODV lets the users maintain and analyze very large datasets on inexpensive and portable hardware. Various types of graphics output can be produced easily, including high-quality station maps, general property-property plots {{of one or more}} stations, scatter plots of selected stations, section plots along arbitrary cruise tracks, and property distributions on general isosurfaces. Commonly used isosurfaces are constant depth, density or temperature layers. ODV supports display of scalar and vector data by coloured dots, numerical data values or arrows. In addition, ODV includes three different gridding algorithms that calculate fields on automatically generated grids {{on the basis of the}} normally heterogeneously distributed data. Gridded fields can be contoured and colour shaded. ODV has a large user community with almost 40, 000 registered users worldwide...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an open-source software for real-time rhythm annotation. The software integrates several mod-ules for graphical user interface, user management across a network, tap recording, audio playing, midi interfacing and threading. It {{is a powerful}} tool for conducting listen-ing tests, but can also be used for beat annotation of mu-sic or in a game setup. The parameters of this software, including the real-time constraints, are not pre-defined in the code but can be easily changed in a <b>settings</b> <b>file.</b> Fi-nally, the framework used allows for scalability, as it was developed in openFrameworks. We show the usefulness of the software by applying it in a cross-cultural beat tapping experiment during the ISMIR 2012 conference. An analy-sis of the collected real-time annotations indicates that lis-teners encounter difficulties in synchronizing to music in presence of unfamiliar rhythmic structures and instrumen-tal timbres. 1...|$|R

Entities, as well as relations between them, can be typed with vocabularies similar to the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS). APIS comes with a built in system of autocompletes that allows researchers to import meta-data of entities with just a single click. Out of the box APIS supports Stanbol as a backend for the autocompletes, but the system is rather easy to adapt to any Restfull API. APIS also supports the parsing of RDFs describing entities into an entity. The parsing is configured in a <b>settings</b> <b>file.</b> APIS comes also with a built in highlighter. The highlighter is configured via the built in admin backend and allows to annotate texts with entities and/or relations between entities...|$|R
