40|$|This study {{examines}} how suppliers {{who do not}} have bargaining power to protect relationship-specific investments (RSIs) can use <b>safeguarding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to create transaction value in the context of asymmetric international subcontracting partnerships. From a supplier perspective, two different types of bilateral <b>safeguarding</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> relationship learning and relational capital, play discrete roles in the process of creating transaction value. Drawing on a resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, this study proposes that RSIs (a firm's resources), can enhance relationship learning (capabilities), which in turn, facilitates dyadic capability enhancing (joint competitive advantage). In addition, from a social capital perspective, relational capital facilitates relationship learning and strengthens the positive relationship between RSIs and relationship learning. Relationship learning plays the key role, and acts as the catalyst in transforming RSIs and relational capital into dyadic capability enhancing. The hypotheses are tested using data from a survey of 118 Taiwanese supplier-international buyer relationships in information technology industries. The study finds that relationship learning mediates the relationship between RSIs and dyadic capability enhancing, and that relational capital moderates the relationship between RSIs and relationship learning. ...|$|R
50|$|During the Doha negotiations, {{developing}} countries have fought {{to protect their}} interest and population, afraid of competing on the global market with strong developed and exporting economies. In many countries large populations living in rural areas, with limited access to infrastructure, farming resources and few employment alternatives. Thus, these countries are concerned that domestic rural populations employed in import-competing sectors might be negatively affected by further trade liberalization, becoming increasingly vulnerable to market instability and import surges as tariff barriers are removed. Several mechanisms have been suggested {{in order to preserve}} those countries: the Special <b>Safeguard</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (SSM) and treatment of Special Products (SPs).|$|E
50|$|A Special <b>Safeguard</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (SSM) {{would allow}} {{developing}} countries to impose additional safety measures {{in the event of}} an abnormal surge in imports or the entry of unusually cheap imports. Debates have arisen around this question, some negotiating parties claiming that SSM could be repeatedly and excessively invoked, distorting trade. In turn, the G33 bloc of developing countries, a major SSM proponent, has argued that breaches of bound tariffs should not be ruled out if the SSM is to be an effective remedy. A 2010 study by the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development simulated the consequences of SSM on global trade for both developed and developing countries.|$|E

40|$|The key {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to highlight the interconnectedness between Chinas political and economic system and its weak enforcement of accounting and auditing standards. The institutional analysis shows that the prevailing political and economic priorities constituting Chinas socialist market economy create a framework, that basically relies on state-led enforcement with weak supplementary private <b>safeguard</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The resulting policy-mix is characterized by a mismatch of incentives and available devices to effectively enhance enforcement. While the state bureaucracy has little incentive to effectively fight financial misreporting because of both blurred policyeconomy boundaries and the coexistence of multiple and even non-economic goals, shareholders and creditors do not have sufficient and effective private <b>safeguard</b> <b>mechanisms</b> at hand. Findings lead to the conclusion that Chinas recent harmonization move of accounting and auditing standards urgently needs to be backed up by stronger efforts to create effective enforcement mechanisms. Sound reforms would have to center on a rigorous upgrading and restructuring of the responsible bodies supervising auditing quality and financial disclosure. Parallel to these measures, the increasing integration into the global economy may provide incentives and competitive pressure to comply with globally accepted standards. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} mechanisms {{available to the}} seeker to encourage participation of solvers to a challenge.

Thus, seekers utilize many <b>safeguard</b> contractual <b>mechanisms</b> to mitigate these risks and protect the information shared in a challenge. By using data from two intermediate crowdsourcing pltaforms, we provide that <b>safeguard</b> <b>mechanisms</b> may have a drawback effect; since they increase information asymmetry of participants on the execution system and the rewarding schema of a challenge, they decrease solvers’ fairness and make solvers less commit.

40|$|After {{two decades}} of liberalized {{economic}} policies together with early accession to WTO, Sri Lanka could not achieve the exp ected fast economic growth. Agriculture growth in particular fell sharply. WTO Doha round expects a deeper liberalization. Instead, we will benefit more from being {{a friend of the}} "Development Box" and securing flexibility in tariff revisions. In asserting this, the paper analyzes impacts of liberalized policies on agriculture, stress the need for flexible trade policies and formulate a design for self designating Special Products (SP) and Special <b>Safeguard</b> <b>Mechanisms</b> (SSM). The past economic growth favoured mostly urbanised population. Sluggish rural agricultural growth, hurt with increased food imports, was the main cause of this unbalance development. Therefore the sustainable growth of the agriculture sector, facilitated by some protection, is necessary for equitable economic development. As the country budget restricts domestic support, the SP and SSM modalities would be the most suitable protective tools. WTO Hong Kong meeting allows flexibility in tariff schedules to address rural development (RD), food security (FS) and livelihood security (LS) needs through protection. The study identified appropriate criteria to designate agriculture products contributing to RD, FS, and LS for protection from dumping and import surges. The study recommends SP and also Volume and Price triggers for products as appropriate to invoke SSM for Sri Lanka.

A stochastic simulation model of the world wheat market is used to investigate {{the effects of the}} special <b>safeguard</b> <b>mechanism.</b> As expected, the quantity-based safeguard is found to reduce imports, raise domestic prices, and boost mean domestic production in the countries that implement it. However, rather than insulating developing countries in those regions from price volatility, the quantity-based safeguard increases domestic price volatility, largely by restricting imports when domestic output is low and prices are high. The quantity-based safeguard shrinks average wheat imports nearly 50 percent in some regions, and global wheat trade falls by 4. 7 percent. The price-based safeguard discriminates against lower price exporters and contributes to producer price instability. Copyright The Author 2010.
