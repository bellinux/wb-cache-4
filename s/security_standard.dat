25|$|The Payment Card Industry Data <b>Security</b> <b>Standard</b> (PCI DSS) is the <b>security</b> <b>standard</b> {{issued by}} the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). This data <b>security</b> <b>standard</b> is used by {{acquiring}} banks to impose cardholder data security measures upon their merchants.|$|E
25|$|Payment Card Industry Data <b>Security</b> <b>Standard</b> (PCI DSS) {{establishes}} comprehensive {{requirements for}} enhancing payment account data security. It {{was developed by}} the founding payment brands of the PCI Security Standards Council, including American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard Worldwide and Visa International, to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures on a global basis. The PCI DSS is a multifaceted <b>security</b> <b>standard</b> that includes requirements for security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, software design and other critical protective measures.|$|E
25|$|Administrative {{controls}} (also called chibai) {{consist of}} approved written policies, procedures, standards and guidelines. Administrative controls form {{the framework for}} running the business and managing people. They inform people on how the business is to be run and how day-to-day operations are to be conducted. Laws and regulations created by government bodies are also a type of administrative control because they inform the business. Some industry sectors have policies, procedures, standards and guidelines that must be followed – the Payment Card Industry Data <b>Security</b> <b>Standard</b> (PCI DSS) required by Visa and MasterCard is such an example. Other examples of administrative controls include the corporate security policy, password policy, hiring policies, and disciplinary policies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a survey of XML-based <b>security</b> <b>standards</b> that can be used for {{handling}} security requirements of distributed computing systems like Grid and Cloud. Distributed systems are expanding and their growth is apparent from the advancements in the field of distributed computing technologies like Grid, Peer-to-peer, Cloud, Pervasive Systems etc. As a result of this expansion, security requirements are also increasing and becoming important. The expansion of Grid and Cloud demands new <b>security</b> <b>standards</b> for handling specialized security requirements and concerns of these systems. Different <b>security</b> <b>standards</b> are in use for handling security requirements of different systems. This paper presents a survey of important XML-based <b>security</b> <b>standards,</b> identifies general and specialized security requirements of Grid and Cloud like systems and then relates them to <b>security</b> <b>standards.</b> The paper also presents a general, <b>security</b> <b>standards</b> based view of distributed computing systems showing the applicability of XML-based <b>security</b> <b>standards</b> in handling <b>security</b> concerns of these systems.

40|$|Security {{threats are}} a {{significant}} problem for information technology companies today. This book focuses on how to mitigate these threats by using <b>security</b> <b>standards</b> and provides ways to address associated problems faced by engineers caused by ambiguities in the <b>standards.</b> The <b>security</b> <b>standards</b> are analysed, fundamental concepts of the <b>security</b> <b>standards</b> presented, and the relations to the elementary concepts of security requirements engineering (SRE) methods explored. Using this knowledge, engineers can build customised methods that support the establishment of <b>security</b> <b>standards.</b> Standar...|$|R
2500|$|In December 2006, the British Standards Institution (BSI) {{released}} an independent standard for BCP—BS 25999-1. Prior {{to the introduction}} of BS 25999, BCP professionals relied on information <b>security</b> <b>standard</b> BS 7799, which only peripherally addressed BCP to improve an organization's information security procedures. BS 25999's applicability extends to all organizations. In 2007, the BSI published BS 25999-2 [...] "Specification for Business Continuity Management", which specifies requirements for implementing, operating and improving a documented business continuity management system (BCMS).|$|E
2500|$|Information Assurance is {{also the}} term used by governments, {{including}} {{the government of the}} United Kingdom, for the provision of holistic security to information systems. [...] In this use of the term, the interdisciplinary approach set out above is somewhat lessened in that, while security/ systems engineering, business continuity/ enterprise resilience, forensic investigation and threat analysis is considered, management science, accounting and criminology is not considered in developing mitigation to the risks developed in the risk assessments conducted. [...] HMG Information Assurance Standard 1&2, which has replaced HMG Information <b>Security</b> <b>Standard</b> 2, sets out the principles and requirements of risk management in accordance with the above principles {{and is one of the}} Information Assurance Standards currently used within the UK public sector.|$|E
