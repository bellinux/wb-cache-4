40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. In this work, SAC 305 {{lead-free}} solder reinforced with 0. 1 wt.  % fullerene nanoparticles was prepared using a powder metallurgy method. A lab-made setup and a corresponding Cu/solder/Cu sample for thermo-migration (TM) test were designed and implemented. The feasibility of this setup for TM stressing was further verified with experimental and simulation methods; a temperature gradient in a <b>solder</b> <b>seam</b> was calculated as 1070  K/cm. Microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of both plain and composite solder alloys were then studied under {{the condition of}} TM stressing. It was shown that compared to unreinforced SAC 305 solder, the process of diffusion of Cu atoms in the composite <b>solder</b> <b>seam</b> was remarkably suppressed. After the TM test for 600  h, Cu/solder interfaces in the composite <b>solder</b> <b>seam</b> were more stable and the inner structure remained more intact. Moreover, the addition of fullerene reinforcement can considerably affect a distribution of Cu 6 Sn 5 formed {{as a result of}} dissolution of Cu atoms during the TM test. Hardness data across the <b>solder</b> <b>seam</b> were also found notably different because of the elemental redistribution caused by TM...|$|R

40|$|Residual stress {{distribution}} in soldered structure of Kovar alloy and Al 2 O 3 ceramics was determined using XRD analyses. In order {{to measure the}} residual stress, position of the characteristic diffraction peak and stress constant were obtained using several versatile/advanced techniques after calibration. Residual stress of soldered structure was measured based on the diffraction patterns obtained for the distribution of residual stress in the soldered joint. Only diffraction peak at 149 ° for Kovar alloy and two diffraction peaks ranging from 140 – 170 ° for Al 2 O 3 ceramics {{were found to be}} appropriate for the residual stress determination. It was also confirmed that for Al 2 O 3 ceramics the XRD peak at 152 ° reflects the changes of stress more precisely than the one at 146 °. The stress constant K of Kovar alloy and Al 2 O 3 ceramics was found to be − 197 MPa/° and − 654 MPa/°, respectively. After soldering, the maximum residual stress of the soldered joint of both materials developed at 1 mm from the <b>soldering</b> <b>seam,</b> and the values within 3 mm from the <b>soldering</b> <b>seam</b> are generally significant. Thus, it is important {{to pay attention to the}} area of 3 mm from the <b>soldering</b> <b>seam</b> in practical application...|$|R

40|$|There the {{purposes}} are {{to develop and}} to introduce the structural and manufacturing methods of reliability rise of Integrated Circuits (IC) of 142 series {{as well as the}} methods of quality inspection in full-scale production. The method of equalization to rise the IC reliability has been grounded by theory; the statistic system of quality inspection of IC, which is distinguished by use of results of accelerated tests and of equalization method, has been developed. It was ascertained that the capillary vacuum soldering of crystals gives the decrease of porosity of <b>soldered</b> <b>seam</b> in comparison with the hydrogen soldering. The technique of rejection of potentially-unreliable IC of 142 series has been developed. It was showed by practice that the reliability of IC of 142 series may be risen not lesser than 2 times at the expense of improvement of construction of body, at the expense of improvement of assembly and test process only.

Purpose of the work: {{development of}} methods for estimating the permissible level of macroflaws in the soldered joints of the microelectronic device elements. The theoretical calculations {{were made on}} a computer by a method of finite elements. New finite-element mathematical models are developed for the calculation of the stress-deformed state of the structurally heterogeneous soldered joints. The finite-element method was used for determining {{the nature of the}} stress-deformed state in the structurally heterogeneous soldered joints for the first time ever. Practical results: charts of distribution of the stress-deformed state, chart of distribution of the finish microhardness, interferogram, profilogram and table of flaws. The stress-deformed state was experimentally determined in the soldered joint with various flaws in the <b>soldered</b> <b>seam.</b> The levels of the permissible flaws in the soldered joint are determined. The recommendations are put into practice and pilot small lots of sealed housings of the microelectronic devices with soldered joints are produced.

40|$|The {{submitted}} {{study is}} about the comparison of the mechanical solidity of soldered and differently laser welded test specimens from a Palladium based alloy before and {{after six months of}} chemical stress. By vacuum-pressure-technique 80 DIN meeting test specimens have been produced from the Palladium alloy BegoPal® 300. 3 of the 10 series originated from five times cast reused metal, the remaining from pure new metal. After visual check of the test specimens, separating and linking took place for the respective method of fusion to tested. Series 3 and 4, both from metal, was soldered {{with the help of the}} flame and solder. Series 5 and 6 from new metal were welded together (butt joint) under application of a laser with in pilot tests found laser-parameter-combination of 0, 6 mm diameters, tension of 310 V, and impulse-duration of 11, 5 ms. The series 7 and 8 were equally treated like the 5 and 6 series, but consisted of reused metal however. The series 9 and 10 from new metal were cut symmetrical too, but also roof-ridge like, and a gauge was used as well as additional material for welding. The laser parameter were not changed for this fusion. All series were tested in the zone of fusion through an EDX-analysis, determined with micro-temper-stress-marks after Vickers with 10 measuring points. After the series 4, 6, 8, and 10 were stored for 6 month in artificial saliva, these series were again tested through EDX-analysis after this chemical stress. Altogether 100 EDX test results were established. First of all, a tension test after DIN EN 10002 : 1991 was applied to the genuine series 1 (new metal) and 2 (reused metal) to establish a standard of comparison. The tension-resistance-factor for the series 1 and 2 reached an average of 829 MPa and 838 MPa. The soldered series achieved 42 % of these results (349 ± 64 MPa), respectively after treatment with artificial saliva 40 % of the results of the genuine series 1. All soldered test specimens broke in the <b>soldered</b> <b>seam.</b> The series 5 and 6 (new metal) achieved not only before, but also after the treatment with artificial saliva very good tension-test results of 77 % - 82 %, as well as the additional material laser welded test specimens, which achieved 77 % before and 69 % after chemical stress (artificial saliva). The light-microscopic examinations of the fracture-surface after the tests showed surfaces with shrinkholes on the soldered series, but no corrosion. The laser-welded series showed gas-shrinkholes and zones of incomplete welding. However, homogeneous surface could be found too. The resistance was not essentially lowered despite gas-shrinkholes in comparison to homogenous surfaces. All by laser welded test specimens broke, however, in the seam also. The applied EDX-analysis showed on the laser-welded specimens after the chemical treatment (artificial saliva) basically no change of the adhesive oxides on the surface. The element-distribution on the soldered surface showed considerably differences in comparison to the genuine test specimens already before the chemical treatment with artificial saliva. With reference to the tensile strength, the laser welding, and here above all the butt joint method, has to be preferred to soldering, under consideration that even the untrained use of laser welding results in higher and not only with standards complying tensile strength. </table...|$|E

In accordance with regulatory guidelines, quality control soldered connections is allowed to use an acoustic kind of control methods of the reflected light, transmitted light, resonant, free vibration and acoustic emission. Attempts to use traditional methods of non-destructive testing did not lead to positive results. This is due primarily to the size of typical solder joint defects, as well as the structural features of the rocket engine, the data structure is not controllable. In connection with this, a new method that provides quality control soldered connections cameras LRE based on the thermo generation of ultrasound.
