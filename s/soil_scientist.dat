40|$|Abstract Little {{effort has}} been made to link soil mapping and soil data density to a nation’s welfare. Soil map density in 31 European {{countries}} and 44 low and middle income countries is linked to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and the number of <b>soil</b> <b>scientists</b> per country. National coverage of exploratory soil maps (> 1 : 250 000) is generally higher in the poorest countries and decreases with increasing GDP per capita, whereas the national coverage of detailed soil maps (< 1 : 50 000) tends to increase with increasing GDP. GDP is larger in countries with more <b>soil</b> <b>scientists</b> per unit area, likewise, the number of <b>soil</b> <b>scientists</b> increases with increasing GDP. More <b>soil</b> <b>scientists</b> per ha of agricultural land was found to be related to higher crop yields. Obviously, there are many confounding and interacting factors but this analysis illustrates how proxies for soil map density can be used; it is suggested that appropriate indicators should also be developed for spatial data infrastructures and digital soil maps to demonstrate their effectiveness for society and human welfare...|$|R

25|$|The School's {{name was}} changed from Bridgnorth Grammar School to Bridgnorth Endowed School in 1974 {{when it began}} the {{transition}} from a selective to a comprehensive intake. The new name reflected the Endowed School's history, referring to the endowments it had received. In the nineteenth century the terms endowed school and grammar school were used interchangeably as in the Endowed Schools Act 1869. In {{the second half of the}} twentieth century the Endowed School's buildings and sporting facilities on the Northgate site were greatly expanded with a new Lower School complex and a new Leisure Centre which the Endowed School had sole use of during the school day. Famous twentieth century alumni of the School include Sir Cedric Hardwicke, the Hollywood and stage actor, Cyril Washbrook, the cricketer who played for Lancashire and England and who gained a famous record as batsman, Professor Peter Bullock, the inspirational <b>soil</b> <b>scientist</b> who was a member of the IPCC (the work of the IPCC, including the contributions of many scientists, was recognised by the joint award of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize), and the historian John Mason.|$|E

5000|$|The {{balance-sheet}} {{theory of}} plant nutrition dominated {{the laboratory and}} the geological concept dominated field work. Both approaches were taught in many classrooms until the late 1920s. Although broader and more generally useful concepts of soil were being developed by some <b>soil</b> <b>scientists,</b> especially Eugene W. Hilgard (1833-1916) and George Nelson Coffey (1875-1967) in the United States and <b>soil</b> <b>scientists</b> in Russia, the necessary data for formulating these broader concepts came from the field work of the soil survey.|$|R

2500|$|American <b>soil</b> <b>scientist</b> Andrew McClung, {{who first}} {{showed that the}} ecologically biodiverse savannah of the Cerrado region of Brazil could grow {{profitable}} soybeans, was awarded the 2006 World Food Prize on October 19, 2006. However, even correcting for poor soils soybeans were an unlikely cash crop for the Cerrado. Soy did not fare well in the low latitudes. More than the heat and humidity, it {{was a lack of}} seasons that hampered production. In the higher more northerly latitudes, flowering coincides with the summer solstice, when the plants reach their maximum height. The first soybeans planted in the Cerrado, however, flowered early and, deprived of long summer days, remained stunted. For soy agriculture to take root in Mato Grosso it was first necessary to develop a [...] "tropical soybean"—one that would flower later, giving the plants more time to fully mature. This was accomplished after years of crossbreeding by scientists within Embrapa, the research arm of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture.|$|E

50|$|Agricultural <b>soil</b> <b>scientists</b> study {{ways to make}} soils more productive. They {{classify}} {{soils and}} test them {{to determine whether they}} contain nutrients vital to plant growth. Such nutritional substances include compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. If a certain soil is deficient in these substances, fertilizers may provide them. Agricultural <b>soil</b> <b>scientists</b> investigate the movement of nutrients through the soil, and the amount of nutrients absorbed by a plant's roots. Agricultural <b>soil</b> <b>scientists</b> also examine the development of roots and their relation to the soil. Some agricultural <b>soil</b> <b>scientists</b> try to understand the structure and function of soils in relation to soil fertility. They grasp the structure of soil as porous solid. The solid frames of soil consist of mineral derived from the rocks and organic matter originated from the dead bodies of various organisms. The pore space of the soil is essential for the soil to become productive. Small pores serve as water reservoir supplying water to plants and other organisms in the soil during the rain-less period. The water in the small pores of soils is not pure water; they call it soil solution. In soil solution, various plant nutrients derived from minerals and organic matters in the soil are there. This is measured through the cation exchange capacity. Large pores serve as water drainage pipe to allow the excessive water pass through the soil, during the heavy rains. They also serve as air tank to supply oxygen to plant roots and other living beings in the soil. In short, agricultural <b>soil</b> <b>scientists</b> see the <b>soil</b> as a vessel, the most precious one for us, containing all of the substances needed by the plants and other living beings on earth.|$|R
