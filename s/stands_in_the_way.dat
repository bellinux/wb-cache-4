According to British journalist Robert Fisk, the Battle of Maysalun was [...] "a struggle which every Syrian learns at school but about which almost every Westerner is ignorant". Historian Tareq Y. Ismael wrote that following the battle, the [...] "Syrian resistance at Khan Maysalun soon took on epic proportions. It was viewed as an Arab attempt to stop the imperial avalanche." [...] He also states that the Syrians' defeat caused popular attitudes in the Arab world that exist until the present day which hold that the Western world dishonors the commitments it makes to the Arab people and [...] "oppresses anyone who <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of its imperial designs." [...] Sati' al-Husri, a major pan-Arabist thinker, asserted that the battle was [...] "one of the most important events in the modern history of the Arab nation."

A spokesman for the ICTY told Radio Free Europe that [...] "any claim that the number of victims {{after the fall of the}} Srebrenica enclave was around the 2,000 mark, and most of those killed in battle, is an absolutely outrageous claim. It's utterly false, and it flies in the face of all of the evidence painstakingly collected in the investigation into the tragedy." [...] He described the effort to minimise the number of victims as [...] "frankly, disgusting." [...] Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the ICTY, described the report's authors as [...] "totally blind, profoundly insensitive and clearly willing to obstruct all efforts to find reconciliation, truth and justice." [...] Del Ponte's legal adviser, Jean-Jacques Joris, criticised the report as [...] "a saddening example of revisionism and an element which certainly <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of reconciliation in the region."

500|$|Franklin {{argues that}} the end of the Cold War brought two main changes. First, the threat of war between the United States and Soviet Union was {{replaced}} by regional wars among smaller states. Second, war was transposed to what Franklin calls [...] "another key"—the struggle for global commercial and economic dominance. She asserts that this new form of war is now called globalization and its battlefields are global stock and currency markets. This economic warfare defines the enemy as all those who care about the values of community. [...] "Whatever cannot be merely bought and sold," [...] Franklin writes, [...] "whatever cannot be expressed in terms of money and gain-loss transactions <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of the 'market' as enemy territory to be occupied, transformed and conquered." [...] A main strategy in this kind of warfare is the privatization of formerly public domains such as culture, health care, prisons and education to generate private profit. Franklin contends that the new economic warlords or [...] "marketeers" [...] aim, for example, to transform [...] "the ill health or misery of our neighbours into investment opportunities for the next round of capitalism." [...] She argues that marketeers have become occupying forces served by [...] "puppet governments who run the country for the benefit of the occupiers." [...] Franklin has also noted that in democratic politics, the economy is all that seems to matter. [...] "Canada has almost no foreign policy," [...] she says, [...] "but rather is part of an elaborate network of trade agreements." ...|$|E

However, Fonville was not able to throw at the distances he reached in 1948. After a victory in a meet against Wisconsin, The Wisconsin State Journal said: [...] "Charlie Fonville, the former world recordholder in the shot put, heaved a creditable [...] to win the event. The Negro star, sidelined for 18months, returned to competition three weeks ago to heave more than 55feet." [...] He also won the Big Ten Conference indoor title for the third time. However, the AP noted that Fonville [...] "returned to competition this season after laying out last year and either has lost his terrific snap or is favoring the back."

His statue stands in a major square in central Damascus, with streets and schools named in his honor throughout Syria. Statues of al-'Azma are also present across the Middle East.

2500|$|The idea of atonement for sin is {{criticized by}} Richard Dawkins {{on the grounds}} that the image of God as {{requiring}} the suffering and death of Jesus to effect reconciliation with humankind is immoral. The view is summarized by Dawkins: [...] "if God wanted to forgive our sins, why not just forgive them? Who is God trying to impress?" [...] Oxford theologian Alister McGrath maintains that Dawkins is [...] "ignorant" [...] of Christian theology, and therefore unable to engage religion and faith intelligently. He goes on to say that the atonement was necessary because of our flawed human nature, which made it impossible for us to save ourselves, and that it expresses God's love for us by removing the sin that <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of our reconciliation with God. Responding to the criticism that he is [...] "ignorant" [...] of theology, Dawkins asks, [...] "Do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in leprechauns?" [...] and [...] "es, I have, of course, met this point before. It sounds superficially fair. But it presupposes that there is something in Christian theology to be ignorant about. The entire thrust of my position is that Christian theology is a non-subject." [...] Dinesh D'Souza says that Dawkins' criticism [...] "only makes sense if you assume Christians made the whole thing up." [...] He goes on to say that Christians view it as a beautiful sacrifice, and that [...] "through the extremity of Golgotha, Christ reconciles divine justice and divine mercy." [...] Andrew Wilson argues that Dawkins misses the point of the atonement, which has nothing to do with masochism, but is based on the concepts of holiness, sin and grace.|$|E
