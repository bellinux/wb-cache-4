25|$|The first telescopes, called refracting telescopes {{were also}} {{developed}} {{with a single}} objective and eyepiece lens.

The objective focuses {{an image of a}} distant object at its focal point which is adjusted to be at the focal point of an eyepiece of a much <b>smaller</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length.</b> The main goal of a telescope is not necessarily magnification, but rather collection of light which is determined by the physical size of the objective lens. Thus, telescopes are normally indicated by the diameters of their objectives rather than by the magnification which can be changed by switching eyepieces. Because the magnification of a telescope is equal to the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of the objective divided by the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of the eyepiece, smaller focal-length eyepieces cause greater magnification.|$|R

Designing and building a compact Shearographic NDT system will enhance the capability of inspection during quality assurance and maintenance routines as well as reduce inspection time. Older compact Shearographic systems, which have been tested satisfactorily both under laboratory and field conditions at the NDT Laboratory at the University of Cape Town, have a rather restricted field of view. This is due to the proprietary shearing optics being placed in front of the camera lens, which in other words means that the field of view can only be increased by using a relatively <b>small</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> camera lens which results in having to increase the size of the shearing optics.

40|$|Photogrammetric mapping using Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) cameras is {{becoming}} more popular. Their popularity is augmented by {{the increasing use of}} Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) as a platform for mapping. The mapping precision of these methods can be increased by using a calibrated camera. The USGS/EROS has developed an inexpensive, easy to use method, particularly for calibrating short <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> cameras. The method builds on a self-calibration procedure developed for the USGS EROS Data Center by Pictometry (and augmented by Dr. C. S Fraser), that uses a series of coded targets. These coded targets form different patterns that are imaged from nine different locations with differing camera orientations. A free network solution using collinearity equations is used to determine the calibration parameters. For the <b>smaller</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> COTS cameras, the USGS has developed a procedure that uses a small prototype box that contains these coded targets. The design of the box is discussed, along with best practices for calibration procedure. Results of calibration parameters obtained using the box are compared with the parameters obtained using more established standard procedures...|$|R

The second side will compensate phase distribution differences between ideal thin structure and real volume one. The computer-aided optimization algorithm is performed to design an additional phase distribution of correcting layer assuming volume designing of the first side of the element.

40|$|The KU EcoHawks are a {{mechanical}} engineering, undergraduate, senior design {{group at the}} University of Kansas that focuses on projects emphasizing a sustainable approach to automobiles and energy infrastructure. Much of the EcoHawks construction work is completed at a barn on campus that does not currently contain a heating or air conditioning system.

This past academic year, one design group implemented a heating system for the barn utilizing a solar thermal parabolic collector. During the design phase, research of the literature found relatively little information in regards to the optimized depth of the parabolic curve. As a result, a prototype solar thermal parabolic trough was built in order to test three different parabolic shapes with varied depths. Static testing of a 50 - 50 mix of ethylene glycol and water found that the parabolic shape with the <b>smallest</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> had the greatest solar collection efficiency.

40|$|For small camera modules in {{consumer}} applications, such as mobile phones or webcams, size and cost are important constraints. An autofocus system increases both size and cost and can degrade optical performance by misalignment. Therefore, a monolithic optical {{system with a}} fixed focus is preferable for these applications. On the other hand, the optical system of the camera has to exhibit a very large depth of field, as {{it is expected to}} deliver sharp images for all typical working distances. The depth of field of a camera system can be increased by using a larger F-number, but this is undesirable due to light sensitivity considerations. On the other hand, it can also be increased by reducing <b>focal</b> <b>length.</b> Multi-aperture systems use multiple optical channels, each of them with a <b>smaller</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> than a comparable single-aperture system. Accordingly, each of the channels has a large depth of field. However, as the channels are displaced laterally, parallax becomes noticeable for close objects. Therefore, the channel images have to be shifted accordingly when recombining them into a complete image. We demonstrate an algorithm that compensates for parallax as well as chromatic aberration and geometric distortion. We present a very flat camera system without moving parts that is capable of taking photos and video at a wide range of distances. On the demonstration system, object distance can be adjusted in real time from 4 mm to infinity. The focus position can be selected during capture or after the images were taken...|$|R

50|$|A teleconverter works {{similarly}} to a telephoto group of a proper telephoto lens. It {{consists of a}} group of lenses which together act as a single diverging lens. The location of a teleconverter is such that the image produced by the objective is located behind the teleconverter in a distance <b>smaller</b> than its <b>focal</b> <b>length.</b> This image is a virtual object of the teleconverter, which is then focused further away and thus enlarged.

5000|$|This section gives a brief {{introduction}} {{to the subject of}} [...] "Equivalence" [...] in photography. Equivalent images are made by photographing the same angle of view, with the same depth of field and the same Angular resolution due to diffraction limitation (which requires different f-stops on different <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> lenses), the same motion blur (requires the same shutter speed), therefore the ISO setting must differ to compensate for the f-stop difference. The use of this is only to let us compare the effectiveness of the sensors given the same amount of light hitting them. In normal photography with any one camera, equivalence is not necessarily an issue: there are several lenses faster than f/2.4 for micro four thirds (see the tables under Fixed <b>Focal</b> <b>Length</b> Lenses, below), and there are certainly many lenses faster than f/4.8 for full frame and no one hesitates to use them even though they can have shallower depth of field than a Nikon 1 at f/1.7, in fact that can be seen as advantageous, {{but it has to be}} taken into consideration that a further aspect of image resolution is limitation by optical aberration, which can be compensated the better the <b>smaller</b> the <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> of a lens is. Lenses designed for mirrorless camera systems such as Nikon 1 or Micro Four Thirds often use image-space telecentric lens designs, which reduce shading and therefore light loss and blurring at the microlenses of the image sensor. Furthermore, in low light conditions by using low f-numbers a too shallow depth of field can lead to less satisfying image results, especially in videography, when the object taken by the camera or the camera itself are moving. For those interested in producing equivalent images, read on.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{reason for}} using the Cassegrain design is to {{increase}} the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of the antenna, to improve the field of view [...] Parabolic reflectors used in dish antennas have a large curvature and short focal length; the focal point is located near the mouth of the dish, to reduce the length of the supports required to hold the feed structure or secondary reflector. The focal ratio (f-number, the ratio of the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> to the dish diameter) of typical parabolic antennas is 0.25 - 0.8, compared to 3 - 8 for parabolic mirrors used in optical systems such as telescopes. In a front-fed antenna, a [...] "flatter" [...] parabolic dish with a long <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> would require an impractically elaborate support structure to hold the feed rigid with respect to the dish. However, the drawback of this <b>small</b> <b>focal</b> ratio is that the antenna has a small field of view, the angular width that it can effectively focus. Modern parabolic antennas in radio telescopes and communications satellites often use arrays of feedhorns clustered around the focal point, to create a particular beam pattern. These require good off-axis focusing characteristics. The convex secondary reflector of the Cassegrain increases the <b>focal</b> <b>length,</b> and thus the field of view, so these antennas usually use a Cassegrain design.|$|R

40|$|Beauty {{treatment}} for skin requires a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer to generate coagulative necrosis in a <b>small</b> <b>focal</b> volume (e. g., 1 mm 3) placed at a shallow depth (3 – 4. 5 mm {{from the skin}} surface). For this, it is desirable to make the F-number as small as possible under the largest possible aperture in order to generate ultrasound energy high enough to induce tissue coagulation in such a <b>small</b> <b>focal</b> volume. However, satisfying both conditions {{at the same time}} is demanding. To meet the requirements, this paper, therefore, proposes a double-focusing technique, in which the aperture of an ultrasound transducer is spherically shaped for initial focusing and an acoustic lens is used to finally focus ultrasound on a target depth of treatment; it is possible to achieve the F-number of unity or less while keeping the aperture of a transducer as large as possible. In accordance with the proposed method, we designed and fabricated a 7 -MHz double-focused ultrasound transducer. The experimental results demonstrated that the fabricated double-focused transducer had a <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of 10. 2 mm reduced from an initial <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of 15. 2 mm and, thus, the F-number changed from 1. 52 to 1. 02.

40|$|Reflectarrays that emulate {{paraboloidal}} main-reflectors, and hyperboloidal or ellipsoidal sub-reflectors, {{have undergone}} {{a great deal}} of development over the past two decades. More recently, research on the topic has concentrated on overcoming some remaining disadvantages, re-examining certain design issues, and extending reflectarray functionality. This thesis concerns itself with fixed-beam offset-fed single-layer main-reflectarrays and sub-reflectarrays comprised of square or rectangular variable size conducting elements. Both full-wave analyses and experiment are used in all the deliberations. In order to examine reflectarray operating mechanisms the thesis first describes a component-by-component technique whereby the role of the various reflectarray parts can be assessed by determining their individual and aggregate contributions to the reflectarray near- and far-fields. This technique is used to diagnose the fact that feed-image-lobes that appear at off-centre frequencies are caused not only by the groundplane as first thought, but by an imbalance in the complex currents on the patches and groundplane at such frequencies. The use of sub-wavelength elements is shown to suppress such unwanted lobes. The thesis then uses receive- and transmit-modes analysis to show that beam squint at off-centre frequencies, often not accounted for when stating the gain bandwidth of a reflectarray, is due to the shifting of the true focal points away from the geometrical one at these frequencies. It is demonstrated that a two-feed reflectarray arrangement is capable of eliminating beam squint, and that the use of <b>smaller</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> to aperture size (F/D) ratios removes the grating lobes that can appear in such two-feed reflectarrays due to clustering of the aperture amplitude distribution. Finally, the thesis studies the effect of the reality that the angle of incidence of the feed fields on the various reflectarray elements is not the same for all elements, even though this is most often assumed when using element reflection phase versus element size databases in performing reflectarray designs. Careful full-wave analysis reveals that {{it is not only the}} dependence of element reflection phase on incidence angle that is important, but that the individual element pattern beamwidths change and distort as this angle increases. This is important not only from the point of view of the coupling of the feed fields to the elements, but also as far as the angular sector within which the reradiated fields are important. Thus sub-reflectarrays, whose radiation patterns are considerably wider than main-reflectors, are more susceptable to incidence angle effects. It is shown that the use of sub-wavelength elements in a reflectarray largely ensures its immunity to such effects...|$|R
