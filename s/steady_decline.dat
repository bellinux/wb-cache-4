Certainly, the office of mayor of Thinis was occupied by several notable New Kingdom figures: Satepihu, {{who participated in the}} construction of an obelisk for Hatshepsut and was himself subject of an exemplary block statue; the herald Intef, an indispensable member of the royal household and the travelling-companion of Thutmose III; and Min, tutor to the prince Amenhotep III.|$|E

5|$|Although breed {{associations}} and the French National Stud are making {{efforts to protect}} the breed, very low numbers persist, and these organizations consider the breed very close to extinction.

The production of horse meat has declined due to a decrease in consumption, and most male foals are neither selected for reproduction nor work. One author says that more alternatives to slaughter are needed and that the <b>steady</b> <b>decline</b> in breed numbers is proof that the breed is slowly disappearing.

5|$|During the Industrial Revolution the Welsh woollen {{industry}} {{was slow to}} mechanize compared to the mills of northern England. When railways reached mid Wales in the 1860s they brought a flood of cheap mass-produced products that destroyed the local industry. However, development of the South Wales Coalfield opened a growing market for woollen products from water-powered mills in the south west, which prospered until after World War I. At one time {{there were more than}} 300 working wool mills. The industry went into <b>steady</b> <b>decline</b> after World War I, and only a few mills continue to operate.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, Middle Scots, often simply called English, became the {{dominant}} {{language of the}} country.

By the fifteenth century it was the language of government, with acts of parliament, council records and treasurer's accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I onwards. As a result, Gaelic, once dominant north of the Tay, began a <b>steady</b> <b>decline.</b>|$|E

Other waterways, like the Panama Canal {{played an important role in}} the histories of many nations. Inland water transportation remained significantly important even as the advent of railroads and automobiles resulted in a <b>steady</b> <b>decline</b> of canals. Inland water transport is still used for the transportation of bulk commodities e.g. grains, coal, and ore.|$|E

5|$|This {{trend was}} {{documented}} by the Dean of Manchester, Reverend William Herbert. He collected samples and compiled information on {{many aspects of}} the saffron crocus. He was concerned about the <b>steady</b> <b>decline</b> in saffron cultivation {{over the course of the}} 17th century and the dawn of the Industrial Revolution; the introduction in Europe of easily grown maize and potatoes, which steadily took over lands formerly flush with corms, did not help. In addition, the elite who traditionally comprised the bulk of the saffron market were now growing increasingly interested in such intriguing new arrivals as chocolate, coffee, tea, and vanilla. Only in the south of France or in Italy and Spain, where the saffron harvest was culturally primal, did significant cultivation prevail.|$|E
5|$|Among the locally {{produced}} yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870-1890 {{caused a}} <b>steady</b> <b>decline</b> in wool quality. Increasing proportions of brittle kemp {{can be found}} in well-preserved examples from the period. In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population. The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces. The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning. Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult. The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively. From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.|$|E

We find that China’s overall pay inequality started to rise rapidly in the early 1990 s, that it peaked in 2008, with the between-provinces component peaking as early as 2002. Since 2008 overall pay inequality has decreased, with between-province and between-sector inequality both showing <b>steady</b> <b>declines.</b> In these respects, the evolution of pay inequality in China mirrors the trajectory expected under the hypothesis of a Kuznets curve...|$|R

Ending years of <b>steady</b> <b>declines,</b> between 2002 and 2012 the number of Connecticut farms increased 43 percent, with one possible cause an increased consumer appetite for locally sourced food, drawing some younger people to start up small farms.

5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} {{have been}} on a <b>steady</b> <b>decline</b> since the 1960s, due in part to rules banning dangerous forms of contact such as spearing, face tackling and butt blocking. However, catastrophic injuries are still caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, as well when players hit their heads against an opposing player's knee or the ground. Returning to play after sustaining a head injury earlier in the game also places players at risk for an even more severe injury. Many states are requiring teams to prevent players who have shown any signs of a concussion from returning to a game, while other steps such as more aggressive enforcement of safety rules and better condition of the neck muscles have been suggested. Additionally, coaches are being urged to train players to block with their shoulders instead of their heads.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century, Peking opera {{witnessed}} a <b>steady</b> <b>decline</b> in audience numbers. This has been attributed both to a decrease in performance quality and an inability of the traditional opera form to capture modern life. Furthermore, the archaic language of Peking opera required productions to use electronic subtitles, which hampered the development of the form. The influence of Western culture has also left the younger generations impatient with the slow pacing of Peking opera. In response, Peking opera began to see reform starting in the 1980s. Such reforms have taken the form of creating a school of performance theory to increase performance quality, employing modern elements to attract new audiences, and performing new plays outside of the traditional canon. However, these reforms have been hampered by both a lack of funding and an adverse political climate that makes the performance of new plays difficult.|$|E
