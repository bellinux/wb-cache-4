5|$|In the {{meantime}} the horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> {{of the second}} prototype was strengthened and it resumed flying on 20 July. The pilot complained of excess torque pull to the right so the vertical <b>stabilizer</b> was enlarged by , but this {{was just one of}} numerous problems, and it was not ready to pass State acceptance trials without more development work on the powerplant. However, the second prototype continued flight testing until 12 July 1946 when an engine fire forced an emergency landing and it was damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. XIVB and T-1B {{replaced}} the suction-powered gyros in the <b>stabilizer</b> with electrical ones, reducing wiring. This was introduced with the 18,000th T-1 on the AC production line.|$|E
5|$|The {{elevator}} is {{also very}} narrow in chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited elevator control authority. For long term pitch trim and airspeed changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with the elevator used for small adjustments within a <b>stabilizer</b> setting. The <b>stabilizer</b> is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and is crucial to operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E
50|$|Heat <b>stabilizers</b> {{are mainly}} used for {{construction}} products made of polyvinyl chloride, for instance window profiles, pipes and cable ducts. Light <b>stabilizers,</b> for instance HALS, are especially needed for polypropylene and polyethylene. The {{environmental impact of}} <b>stabilizers</b> for polymers can be problematic because of heavy metal content. In Europe lead <b>stabilizers</b> are increasingly replaced by other types, for example calcium-zinc <b>stabilizers.</b>|$|R

5|$|At 15:16, {{while the}} plane was in a shallow right turn at 37,000 feet, the fan disk of its {{tail-mounted}} General Electric CF6-6 engine explosively disintegrated. Debris penetrated the tail in numerous places, including the horizontal <b>stabilizer,</b> puncturing the lines of all three hydraulic systems.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1964, a B-52H {{flown by}} Boeing test pilots lost its {{vertical}} <b>stabilizer</b> to turbulence near East Spanish Peak. It {{was able to}} land at Blytheville Air Force Base, Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 1990, Widerøe Flight 839 crashed {{one minute}} after take-off, killing all five on board. It {{was caused by}} high wind speeds, {{in excess of the}} {{construction}} dimensions, cracking the tail rudder and vertical <b>stabilizer,</b> crashing the plane in the sea after eight seconds.|$|E
30|$|Using OECD {{estimates}} of automatic <b>stabilizers</b> (see van der Noord (2000) and Girouard and André (2005)), the average size across OECD countries has remained unchanged between 2000 and 2005. However, {{there seems to}} be a pattern since countries with initial weak automatic <b>stabilizers</b> have tended to get stronger automatic <b>stabilizers,</b> whereas they have been muted for countries with initial strong automatic <b>stabilizers.</b>|$|R
50|$|NZ Aerosports {{discovered}} <b>stabilizers</b> {{on small}} high performance canopies didn’t do much except flap {{in the wind}} and cause added parasitic drag. The Daedalus Project first dealt with the issue of reducing drag on the wing tips by developing ram-air <b>stabilizers.</b> They quickly found that no <b>stabilizers</b> was even better! The <b>stabilizers</b> primary function is to hold the slider in the correct position during deployment. They addressed this issue by putting slider stops on the canopy itself allowing them {{to get rid of the}} <b>stabilizers</b> all together.|$|R

5|$|On 24 January 1963, a B-52C on a {{training}} mission out of Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts, lost its vertical <b>stabilizer</b> due to buffeting during low-level flight, and crashed {{on the west}} side of Elephant Mountain near Greenville, Maine. Of the nine crewmen aboard, two survived the crash.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-146SR, {{suffered}} a rupture {{of the pressure}} bulkhead in its tail section, caused by undetected damage during a faulty repair to the rear bulkhead after a tailstrike seven years earlier. Pressurized air subsequently rushed out of the bulkhead and blew off the plane's vertical <b>stabilizer,</b> also severing all four of its hydraulic control systems. The pilots were {{able to keep the}} plane airborne for 32 minutes using differential engine power, but without any hydraulics or the stabilizing force of the vertical <b>stabilizer,</b> the plane eventually crashed in mountainous terrain. There were only 4 survivors among the 524 on board. This accident is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history.|$|E
5|$|The Embraer jet, despite {{serious damage}} to the left {{horizontal}} <b>stabilizer</b> and left winglet, was able to continue flying, though its autopilot disengaged and it required an unusual amount of force on the yoke to keep the wings level.|$|E
40|$|The {{usage of}} {{electric}} and electronic products is increasing rapidly. To provide power supply, the Indian power sector faces {{the crisis of}} bridging {{the gap between the}} demand and supply of power. The unstable power supply so produced has led to loss in industrial equipments. To combat the problems of power fluctuations, industries depend on servo voltage <b>stabilizers</b> to stabilize the power supply connected to their expensive machineries. The article focuses on the electrical hazards, consequences of electrical hazards, symptoms of electrical hazards, analysis of the situation in industries, types of <b>stabilizers,</b> servo voltage <b>stabilizers,</b> applications, advantages, history of servo voltage <b>stabilizers</b> and market potential. With the increasing growth of the consumer electronic/electrical products, the need for servo <b>stabilizers</b> is rising rapidly.

40|$|Regularization {{offers a}} {{powerful}} framework for signal reconstruction by enforcing weak constraints {{through the use}} of <b>stabilizers.</b> <b>Stabilizers</b> are functionals measuring the degree of smoothness of a surface. The nature of those functionals constrains the properties of the reconstructed signal. In this paper, we first analyze the invariance of <b>stabilizers</b> with respect to size, transformation and their ability to control scale at which the smoothness is evaluated. Tikhonov <b>stabilizers</b> are widely used in computer vision, even though they do not incorporate any notion of scale and may result in serious shape distortion. We first introduce an extension of Tikhonov <b>stabilizers</b> that offers natural scale control of regularity. We then introduce the intrinsic <b>stabilizers</b> for planar curves that apply smoothness constraints on the curvature pro le instead of the parameter space...|$|R

5|$|The P.1127 lacked any in-built armaments, {{the ethos}} of {{tactical}} flexibility meant a reliance upon underwing hard point-mounted munitions and equipment, which included multiple 2-inch rocket batteries, 30-mm ADEN cannon gun pods, and 1,000 lb bombs, napalm, and range-extending drop tanks. The prototypes were furnished with long nose-mounted instrumentation booms, these were replaced on the Kestrel with a much smaller counterpart on the vertical <b>stabilizer</b> to enable the nose to accommodate a tactical camera instead. An unusual feature of the P.1127 was the installation of a ram air turbine upon the rear fuselage just forward of the vertical <b>stabilizer</b> to provide power for ancillary services {{in the event of}} engine failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{plane was}} {{reported}} to be on sale in March 2011, even though repairs to the left wingtip and <b>stabilizer</b> were still being completed in August 2011. The plane was then sold to a private owner in 2013 and registered in Mexico as XA-MHA.|$|E
5|$|Baconnaise {{contains}} no bacon, artificial flavors, or MSG, {{but the actual}} process and ingredients in the product are a trade secret.

25|$|In Europe, {{particularly}} Belgium, {{there has}} been a commitment to eliminate the use of cadmium (previously used as a part component of heat <b>stabilizers</b> in window profiles) and phase out lead-based heat <b>stabilizers</b> (as used in pipe and profile areas) such as liquid autodiachromate and calcium polyhydrocummate by 2015. According to the final report of Vinyl 2010 cadmium was eliminated across Europe by 2007. The progressive substitution of lead-based <b>stabilizers</b> is also confirmed in the same document showing a reduction of 75% since 2000 and ongoing. This is confirmed by the corresponding growth in calcium-based <b>stabilizers,</b> used as an alternative to lead-based <b>stabilizers,</b> more and more, also outside Europe.|$|R

5|$|Because of the B-52's mission parameters, {{only modest}} {{maneuvers}} {{would be required}} with no need for spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord rudder, giving it limited yaw control authority. Originally an all-moving vertical <b>stabilizer</b> was to be used, but was abandoned because of doubts about hydraulic actuator reliability. Because the aircraft has eight engines, asymmetrical thrust due {{to the loss of}} an engine in flight would be minimal and correctable with the narrow rudder.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, {{before the}} flight {{testing of the}} prototypes was completed, 30 {{production}} aircraft were ordered. They incorporated an ejection seat and a redesigned vertical <b>stabilizer</b> {{as well as two}} auxiliary fins, one towards the tip {{on each side of the}} tailplane in an attempt to improve the directional stability of the aircraft. The fuselage was lengthened to fit additional equipment and the wing had fillets added at the rear junction with the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 1982 Widerøe Flight 933 {{crashed into}} the Barents Sea between Berlevåg and Mehamn Airport, after having made two {{intermediate}} stops since leaving Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen. All fifteen people on board the Twin Otter were killed. The accident was caused by structural failure in the rudder and vertical <b>stabilizer</b> following severe clear-air turbulence. A conspiracy theory arose concerning a collision with a British Harrier fighter, which resulted in four investigations—none which found any evidence of a collision.|$|E
40|$|In the Great Recession {{market income}} of the {{households}} in Austria has been reduced and unemployment increased. In this paper we {{examine the impact of}} automatic <b>stabilizers</b> on cushioning such income losses. We use ITABENA, an Austrian tax-benefit model, to analyze how shocks on market income and employment are mitigated by taxes and transfers. In the case of a proportional income shock 46 percent of the shock will be absorbed by automatic <b>stabilizers</b> in Austria. For the unemployment shocks automatic <b>stabilizers</b> absorb 68 percent. Automatic <b>stabilizers</b> increase the redistributive effects of the Austrian tax benefit system. We find that recent changes in the income tax code have almost no impact on the size of automatic <b>stabilizers</b> in Austria...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{theoretical}} and empirical issues associated with the operation of fiscal <b>stabilizers</b> within an economy. It argues that such <b>stabilizers</b> operate most effectively at a national, rather than local, level. As differing cycles across regions tend to offset {{each other for the}} country as a whole, national fiscal <b>stabilizers</b> are not associated with the same increase in future tax liabilities for the region as local ones. Accordingly, the negative impact from the Ricardian effects associated with these tax liabilities is smaller. Empirical work on data across Canadian provinces indicates that local <b>stabilizers</b> are only 1 / 3 to � as effective as national <b>stabilizers</b> that create no future tax liability. ...|$|R

5|$|On 13 January 1964, a B-52D {{carrying}} two nuclear bombs suffered a structural failure in flight {{that caused the}} tail section to shear off. Four crewmen ejected successfully before the aircraft crashed near Cumberland, Maryland. Two crewmen subsequently perished on the ground because of hypothermia, while another, who was unable to eject, died in the aircraft; both weapons were recovered. This {{was one of several}} incidents caused by failure of the vertical <b>stabilizer.</b>|$|E
5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated {{there was a real}} concern. In response, the areas of the horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E

40|$|Nanocrystals {{have emerged}} as a viable tool to {{increase}} oral bioavailability of poorly water soluble oral solid dosage drugs. They also enable parenteral administration of these drugs as nanosuspensions. The high free surface energy, due to the large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of nanocrystals, makes them prone to aggregation, that can result in physical instability and loss of the previously increased solubility/dissolution. <b>Stabilizers</b> are incorporated into nanocrystalline formulations to prevent aggregation. These include excipients such as polymers and surfactants. They achieve stabilization though electrostatic repulsion and/or steric hindrance. This article focuses on aggregation in nanocrystal based formulations, <b>stabilizers</b> for the inhibition of aggregation, classification of <b>stabilizers,</b> properties of <b>stabilizers</b> and the mechanisms involved in stabilization.
