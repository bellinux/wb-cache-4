5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If <b>stage</b> <b>II</b> or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, {{is under}} {{investigation}} as a potential treatment. Research shows that mTOR inhibitors may be particularly effective for cancers with mutations in PTEN. Ridaforolimus (deforolimus) is also being researched {{as a treatment for}} people who have previously had chemotherapy. Preliminary research has been promising, and a <b>stage</b> <b>II</b> trial for ridaforolimus was completed by 2013. There has also been research on combined ridaforolimus/progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer. Bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which inhibit angiogenesis, are being researched as potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Ixabepilone is being researched as a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Treatments for rare high-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being researched, as there is no established standard of care yet for this disease. Chemotherapies being researched include doxorubicin and ifosfamide.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of <b>stage</b> <b>II</b> or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E

Patients were randomized following surgery and careful intraoperative staging to receive either chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of CisPlatinum, Adriamycin, and Cytoxan and immunotherapy consisted of Levamisole and Intrapleural BCG. Sixty-eight patients were randomized to the immunotherapy arm and 62 to the chemotherapy arm. There were 49 recurrences in the immunotherapy group and 35 in the chemotherapy group (p = 0. 003). These studies indicate that surgical adjuvant chemotherapy is effective in prolonging the disease-free survival in patients with <b>Stages</b> <b>II</b> and III adenocarcinoma and large cell undifferentiated carcinoma.

Among pN+ subjects with stage I metastases, 6 / 7 had primary tumor extending to oral cavity. ConclusionSupraomohyoid neck dissection (<b>stages</b> I, <b>II</b> and III) is the elective treatment of choice when tonsillar primary tumor extends to oral cavity.

40|$|Mast cell tumour, {{a common}} skin tumour of dogs, was treated {{effectively}} with radiation in 85 dogs. Prognosis for tumour-free and survival times {{were affected by}} several factors. Dogs with mast cell tumour of the extremities and dogs with clinical stage 0 (no gross evidence of disease), had significantly longer tumour-free times than did dogs with mast cell tumours of the trunk and dogs with <b>stages</b> <b>II</b> and III neoplasms. Survival times also were influenced by neoplasm location, clinical stage, and neoplasm grade. Dogs with grade II mast cell tumours lived longer than did dogs with grade III mast cell tumours. Overall tumour-free and survival rates were 78. 8 and 77 % and 76. 2 and 73. 2 % at 1 and 2 years, respectively. At 1 year, the rate of metastasis was higher for dogs with grade III neoplasms, for dogs with neoplasms on the trunk, and for dogs with clinical <b>stages</b> <b>II</b> and III neoplasms. ...|$|R
