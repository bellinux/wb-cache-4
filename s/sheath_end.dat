40|$|The ultrastructural {{features}} of the sperm tail differentiation in the lizard, Stenodactylus dorie have been described. The initial event was the caudal migration of the centrioles followed by implantation of the proximal centriole in the nuclear fossa and extension of the distal centriole to form the microtubular axoneme. Thereafter, the neck region and middle, main and end tail pieces were developed. The later three tail pieces along their length encompassed the axonemal core which revealed the typical 9 + 2 arrangement of microtubules. The axonemal core in the middle piece was enveloped within two successive sheaths, the mitochondrial and fibrous ones while in the main piece it was only encircled by the fibrous <b>sheath.</b> <b>End</b> piece only revealed {{the existence of an}} axonemal core surrounded by plasmalemma of the fully differentiated spermatid...|$|E

The first one to describe a fetoscopic-guided lysis of such bands was Quintero [24], and several case reports were published since. Instrumentation consists of a 1.3 -mm fetoscope, which is inserted into a special <b>sheath</b> <b>ending</b> up in scissors. This allows fetoscopic control of {{the section of the}} bands. Alternatively, laser can be used, but that can cause collateral damage [22, 23]. It might be very difficult to section the bands entirely as they get entrapped within edematous surrounding structures.|$|R

The pinnate leaf has a tubular sheath with whorls and scatters of spines and hairy, brown tomentum, the <b>sheath</b> <b>ending</b> in a narrow, armed auricle {{on each side}} of the petiole. The petiole is abaxially rounded, adaxially flattened, hairy, and equipped with grapnel spines. The rachis is similarly armed, the leaflets widely spaced to crowded, linear, with one fold, and covered in bristles and scales; the midrib is adaxially prominent, the transverse veinlets are short yet conspicuous.|$|R

5000|$|Equisetum palustre is a {{perennial}} cryptophyte, growing between 10 and 50 centimeters (4" [...] to 20"), {{in rare cases}} up to one meter (3'). Its fertile shoots, which carry ears, are evergreen and shaped like the sterile shoots. The rough, furrowed stem is one to three mm in diameter with usually eight to ten ribs, in rare cases, four to 12. It contains whorled branches. The tight-fitting <b>sheaths</b> <b>end</b> in four to 12 teeth. The lower sheaths are dark brown and much shorter than the sheaths of the main shoot.

40|$|Morphometric {{characters}} for {{the identification}} of infective larvae (L 3) from Cyathostominae and Strongylinae subfamilies, parasites of equine, are essential {{for the study of}} biology, pathology and antihelminthics resistance of nematode parasites responsible for infections in horses. Females of the parasites in study were obtained by deworming or necropsy. After parasitic identification eggs were collected from each female and were cultured by modified Mönning technique, resulting in L 3 larvae after eight days at 26 - 28 °C. For the present work females from the following species were considered: Craterostomum acuticaudatum, Poteriostomum imparidentatum, Poteriostomum ratzii, Strongylus edentatus, Strongylus vulgaris, Triodontophorus brevicauda, Triodontophorus serratus and Triodontophorus tenuicollis. The objective of the present work was to define morphological parameters to be considered in morphometric identification of Strongylidae of horses. L 3 larvae morphological parameters as, total length of the larvae (with sheath), excretory pore (distance from excretory pore to anterior <b>end),</b> <b>sheath</b> tail length (distance from the anus to the <b>sheath</b> posterior <b>end),</b> maximum larvae width), length of oesophagus, tail length (without sheath) and distal portion (distance from tail <b>end</b> to <b>sheath</b> tail <b>end)</b> were registered. Statistical analyses with Kruskal-Wallis test and Tukey test show {{that it is possible to}} use the considered parameters to distinguish the species concerned because there are significant differences between them. Multinomial regression analyses reveal the most relevant parameters to morphometric specific identification. The most suitable model is explained by the variables excretory pore, sheath tail length, body breadth, length of oesophagus and distal portion. However it may be necessary to refer to less representative parameters to accomplish a correct morphometric specific identification. This contribution to the study of equine strongyles infective larvae allows better laboratory work to the knowledge and control of parasitism in horses...|$|R

40|$|Microbes form mats with {{architectures}} {{that promote}} efficient metabolism {{within a particular}} physicochemical environment, thus studying mat structure helps us understand ecophysiology. Despite much research on chemolithotrophic Fe-oxidizing bacteria, Fe mat architecture has not been visualized because these delicate structures are easily disrupted. There are striking similarities between the biominerals that comprise freshwater and marine Fe mats, made by Beta- and Zetaproteobacteria, respectively. If these biominerals are assembled into mat structures with similar functional morphology, this would suggest that mat architecture is adapted to serve roles specific to Fe oxidation. To evaluate this, we combined light, confocal, and scanning electron microscopy of intact Fe microbial mats with experiments on sheath formation in culture, {{in order to understand}} mat developmental history and subsequently evaluate the connection between Fe oxidation and mat morphology. We sampled a freshwater sheath mat from Maine and marine stalk and sheath mats from Loihi Seamount hydrothermal vents, Hawaii. Mat morphology correlated to niche: stalks formed in steeper O 2 gradients while sheaths were associated with low to undetectable O 2 gradients. Fe-biomineralized filaments, twisted stalks or hollow sheaths, formed the highly porous framework of each mat. The mat-formers are keystone species, with nascent marine stalk-rich mats comprised of novel and uncommon Zetaproteobacteria. For all mats, filaments were locally highly parallel with similar morphologies, indicating that cells were synchronously tracking a chemical or physical cue. In the freshwater mat, cells inhabited <b>sheath</b> <b>ends</b> at the growing edge of the mat. Correspondingly, time lapse culture imaging showed that sheaths are made like stalks, with cells rapidly leaving behind an Fe oxide filament. The distinctive architecture common to all observed Fe mats appears to serve specific functions related to chemolithotrophic Fe oxidation, including (1) removing Fe oxyhydroxide waste without entombing cells or clogging flow paths through the mat and (2) colonizing niches where Fe(II) and O 2 overlap. This work improves our understanding of Fe mat developmental history and how mat morphology links to metabolism. We can use these results to interpret biogenicity, metabolism, and paleoenvironmental conditions of Fe microfossil mats, which would give us insight into Earth's Fe and O 2 history...|$|R
40|$|Serial thin {{sections}} of the coronal dental pulp of the cat's canine tooth were cut. Parts of the sub-odontoblastic neural plexus were photographed from 100 of the sections. The plexus consists of many slender, predominantly unmyelinated nerve fibres. Many axons are incompletely sheathed by their Schwann cell. Some axons leave the Schwann cell <b>sheath</b> and either <b>end</b> in the extracellar space or return to the Schwann cell after traveling a short distance. Several axons are often seen in close contact within a single invagination of the Schwann cell.

40|$|Endoscopic {{carpal tunnel}} release (ECTR) was {{introduced}} into Thailand when this technique became widely accepted. However, the technique {{was limited to}} only a few institutions because of the training required and the very high cost of the instruments. Because of the economic crisis in Thailand, most hospitals in the public health ministry had no budget to invest in new instruments. However, new technology cannot be ignored so the authors modified some unused instruments in conjunction with an arthroscope in order to perform ECTR. A 5 cm by 4 mm slot was made at the mid-portion of an old unused 5 mm arthroscopic <b>sheath.</b> One <b>end</b> of this <b>sheath</b> was reshaped to fit the meniscectomy hook blade. A 4. 5 mm Steinmann pin was reshaped to be the obturator of the arthroscopic sheath. ECTR was performed with this instrument in conjunction with an arthroscope (modified from Chow's 2 -portals technique). The transverse carpal ligament was clearly viewed and identified, and the transverse carpal ligament was completely divided by the menisectomy hook blade. The operation time was 10 to 20 minutes. 30 patients received ECTR with this set of instruments, and they were completely relieved from the symptoms and returned to work early without any complications. The advantages of this instrument are {{that it is very}} cheap, it has a low learning curve, and it is safe and effective...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterial}} Type VI secretion system (T 6 SS) delivers proteins into target cells using fast {{contraction of}} a long sheath anchored to the cell envelope and wrapped around an inner Hcp tube associated with the secreted proteins. Mechanisms of sheath assembly and length regulation are unclear. Here we study these processes using spheroplasts formed from ampicillin-treated Vibrio cholerae. We show that spheroplasts secrete Hcp and deliver T 6 SS substrates into neighbouring cells. Imaging of sheath dynamics shows that the sheath length correlates with the diameter of spheroplasts and may reach up to several micrometres. Analysis of sheath assembly after partial photobleaching shows that subunits are exclusively added to the <b>sheath</b> at the <b>end</b> that is distal from the baseplate and cell envelope attachment. We suggest that this mode of assembly is likely common for all phage-like contractile nanomachines, because of the conservation of the structures and connectivity of sheath subunits...|$|R
5000|$|A tweezer clamp {{consists}} of two short lengths of metal, no more than 5 - 10 cm (2 - 4 in) in length. The two lengths are fixed together {{at one end and}} open at the other end (just like a regular tweezer). The open ends are curved slightly to improve their ability to grip the nipple. Typically, they have a small 1 cm rubber <b>sheath</b> over this <b>end</b> to protect the nipple from damage and reduce slippage. A small ring wraps around the two pieces of metal and is used to adjust the tension. The user places {{the two sides of the}} metal head either side of the nipple, then by sliding the ring along the clamp shaft towards the nipple, causes the two halves to close tighter together. Tension can thus be adjusted depending on the location of the ring [...] - [...] the closer the ring is along the shaft toward the nipple, the tighter the clamp.|$|R
40|$|Bacterial strain 16 - 3 spontaneously {{produces}} a bacteriocin which inhibits {{the growth of}} closely related strain 16 - 2. Both strains were newly isolated from root nodules of lupines and probably belong to the species Rhizobium lupini. Production of infectious progeny of newly isolated virulent phage 16 - 2 - 4 in strain 16 - 2 is inhibited completely if complexes are bacteriocin-treated {{during the first half}} of the latent period. Treatment begun during the second half leads to premature lysis of complexes and inactivates only those progeny phages which were not yet fully matured at the moment of the particle-induced lysis. Examination by electron microscope of the bacteriocin enrichment revealed the presence of particles 123 nm in length which resemble the tails of T-even bacteriophages. Since the particles sediment together with the bactericidal activity in the sucrose gradient and adsorb specifically to bacteriocin-sensitive cells, it is concluded that they are identical with the bactericidal agent. The particles are not found attached to phage heads and cannot self-propagate; they are regarded as incomplete and are named INCO particles. INCO particles consist of a core enveloped by a contractile <b>sheath.</b> One <b>end</b> of the <b>sheath</b> is connected to a baseplate to which six fibers, each 32 nm in length, are attached.

40|$|For the {{geological}} sequestration of atmospheric CO 2 to be viable, {{it is important}} that cement sheath integrity of the well-bore is preserved for a long period. Apart from other modes of failure, the early age damage to the annular cement seal can initiate leakage of CO 2 caused by excessive well-bore pressure and temperature increase/decrease. A composite axi-symmetric multi-cylinder well-bore model has been studied using both analytical and numerical techniques. Static structural and thermal analysis has been performed to investigate the variation of stresses along cement radius for different combinations of well-bore internal and external pressures and temperatures. In addition to that, linear mechanical properties of different cement systems have been investigated to compare the suitability of different cementing materials in well-bore situation. It has been demonstrated from the analysis results that cement with low Young's modulus experiences lower tensile stresses than cement with high Young's modulus for some cases of wellbore internal and external pressures. From the analysis, it also turns out that temperature increase or decrease can develop tensile radial stresses in the cement <b>sheath.</b> In the <b>end,</b> a failure analysis has been presented for different cement systems using Mohr-coulomb failure theory...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} the intraaortic balloon (IAoB) in association with coronary angioplasty in high-risk patients. METHODS: Fourteen high-risk patients unresponsive to clinical therapy and with formal contraindication to surgical revascularization were treated by coronary angioplasty, most of which was followed by stenting. All procedures were performed with circulatory support with the IAoB. This study reports the early results and the late findings after 12 months of follow-up. Six patients had multivessel coronary disease; of these, four had left main equivalent lesions and two had unprotected left main coronary artery disease, one of whom had severe "end-vessel" stenosis and the other was a patient with Chagas' disease with single-vessel lesion. Eleven patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction < 30 %. RESULTS: In 100 % of the patients, the procedures were initially successful. Two patients had severe bleeding during the withdrawal of the left femoral <b>sheath.</b> At the <b>end</b> of twelve months, 4 patients were asymptomatic and the others were clinically controlled.

40|$|My Ph. D. {{research}} involved {{studying the}} process of infection of Escherichia coli bacteria by bacteriophage T 4. Bacteriophage T 4 is a large, double-stranded DNA, tailed virus belonging to the Myoviridae subfamily. The bacteriophage T 4 tail is composed of two concentric cylinders: the inner rigid tail tube and the outer contractile tail <b>sheath.</b> One <b>end</b> of the tail {{is associated with the}} unique portal vertex of the head capsid, whereas the other end is terminated with a baseplate to which the fibers are attached. The baseplate and fibers are responsible for host cell recognition and attachment of the phage to the cell surface. Upon interaction of the fibers with the lipopolysaccharides on the cell surface, the baseplate changes its conformation from hexagonal to star-shaped triggering tail sheath contraction. The contracting tail sheath drives the tail tube through the cell envelope bringing the tube into contact with the inner cell membrane, which initiates release of the phage DNA into the host. ^ Structure of the bacteriophage T 4 baseplate has been investigated using electron cryo-microscopy and X-ray crystallography of the component proteins. The crystal structures of six baseplate proteins, four of which are reported in this work, were fitted into a 12 Å resolution three-dimensional reconstruction of the baseplate in the hexagonal conformation. A 17 Å resolution reconstruction of the star-shaped baseplate was also obtained and interpreted in terms of the component proteins. ^ The baseplate appeared to be stabilized in the hexagonal conformation by the six short tail fibers, which are folded under the baseplate in a garland-like arrangement {{with the help of the}} short tail fiber-attachment protein, gene product (gp) 11. In the star conformation, gp 11 was found to dissociate from the short tail fibers and bind to the long tail fibers. Upon binding to the cell surface receptors, the carboxy terminal, receptor-binding domains of the short tail fibers become free and disengage from the garland, thus unlocking the baseplate structure. The long tail fibers associate with gp 11 and switch the baseplate to the star conformation, which initiates tail sheath contraction. ...|$|R

We evaluated {{the capability of}} intravascular ultrasound to quantify pulmonary artery (PA) morphology in vitro and explored the feasibility of in vivo PA imaging in animals and humans. In the in vitro study of 15 PA segments, we used a 20 -MHz prototype ultrasound catheter. Intravascular ultrasound (y) provided crisp images of PA segments and demonstrated excellent correlations with anatomic measurements (x) in the estimation of luminal area (y= 0. 89 x+ 2. 95, r= 0. 99, p< 0. 001), luminal diameter (n= 30, y= 0. 79 x+ 0. 96, r= 0. 92, p< 0. 001), and vessel wall thickness (n = 60, y= 0. 65 x + 0. 33, r= 0. 85, p < 0. 001). We subsequently introduced the probe into the PA of 10 dogs {{and were able to}} obtain real-time, two-dimensional images of the main PA, its major branches, and farther smaller branches as far as the wedge level.

40|$|Spermatogenesis in Lake Magadi tilapia (Alcolapia grahami), a cichlid fish {{endemic to}} the highly {{alkaline}} and saline Lake Magadi in Kenya, was evaluated using light and transmission electron microscopy. Spermatogenesis, typified by its three major phases (spermatocytogenesis, meiosis and spermiogenesis), was {{demonstrated by the}} presence of maturational spermatogenic cells namely spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa. Primary spermatogonia, the largest of all the germ cells, underwent a series of mitotic divisions producing primary spermatocytes, which then entered two consecutive meiotic divisions to produce secondary spermatocytes and spermatids. Spermatids, in turn, passed through three structurally distinct developmental stages typical of type-I spermiogenesis to yield typical primitive anacrosomal spermatozoa of the externally fertilizing type (aquasperm). The spermatozoon of this fish exhibited a spheroidal head with the nucleus containing highly electron-dense chromatin globules, a midpiece containing ten ovoid mitochondria arranged in two rows and a flagellum formed by the typical 9 + 2 microtubule axoneme. In addition, the midpiece, with no cytoplasmic <b>sheath,</b> appeared to <b>end</b> blindly distally in a lobe-like pattern around the flagellum; a feature that was unique and considered adaptive for the spermatozoon of this species to the harsh external environment. These observations show that the testis of A. grahami often undergoes active spermatogenesis despite the harsh environmental conditions to which it is exposed on a daily basis within the lake. Further, the spermiogenic features and spermatozoal ultrastructure appear to be characteristic of Cichlidae and, therefore, may be of phylogenetic significance...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the environmental requirements of the filamentous sulfur bacteria Thioploca spp., we tested the chemotactic responses of these sedimentary microorganisms to changes in oxygen, nitrate, and sulfide concentrations. A sediment core with a Thioploca mat, retrieved from the oxygen-minimum zone on the Chilean shelf, was incubated in a recirculating flume. The addition of 25 (mu) mol of nitrate per liter to the seawater flow induced the ascent of the Thioploca trichomes (length, up to 70 mm) in their mostly vertically oriented gelatinous <b>sheaths.</b> The upper <b>ends</b> of the filaments penetrated the sediment surface and protruded 1 to 3 mm into the flowing water before they bent downstream. By penetrating the diffusive boundary layer, Thioploca spp. facilitate efficient nitrate uptake in exposed trichome sections that are up to 30 mm long. The cumulative length of exposed filaments per square centimeter of sediment surface was up to 92 cm, with a total exposed trichome surface area of 1 cm(sup 2). The positive reaction to nitrate overruled a negative response to oxygen, indicating that nitrate is the principal electron acceptor used by Thioploca spp. in the anoxic environment; 10 -fold increases in nitrate fluxes after massive emergence of filaments strengthened this hypothesis. A positive chemotactic response to sulfide concentrations of less than 100 (mu) mol liter(sup- 1) counteracted the attraction to nitrate and, along with phobic reactions to oxygen and higher sulfide concentrations, controlled the vertical movement of the trichomes. We suggest {{that the success of}} Thioploca spp. on the Chilean shelf is based on the ability of these organisms to shuttle between the nitrate-rich boundary layer and the sulfidic sediment strata...|$|R
