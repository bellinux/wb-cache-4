60|$|But {{with the}} {{formation}} of the bread-lines came new troubles. There was only so much of a food reserve in San Francisco, and at the best it could not last long. Organized labour, we knew, had its private supplies; nevertheless, the whole working class joined the bread-lines. As a result, the provisions General Folsom had taken possession of diminished with perilous rapidity. How were the soldiers to distinguish between a shabby middle-class man, a member of the I.L.W., or a <b>slum</b> <b>dweller?</b> The first and the last had to be fed, but the soldiers did not know all the I.L.W. men in the city, much less the wives and sons and daughters of the I.L.W. men. The employers helping, a few of the known union men were flung out of the bread-lines; but that amounted to nothing. To make matters worse, the Government tugs that had been hauling food from the army depots on Mare Island to Angel Island found no more food to haul. The soldiers now received their rations from the confiscated provisions, and they received them first.|$|E

We found that while <b>slum</b> <b>dwellers</b> on average present poorer housing conditions than the poor, they are richer and have better job opportunities. However, the slum heterogeneity presented in terms of poverty and informality is a challenge for a more comprehensive, targeted and coordinated public policy for social inclusion...|$|R

In contrast, there has been less attention on what enables <b>slum</b> <b>dwellers</b> to transition into the formal housing sector, which has the dual benefits of improving service access and escaping social stigma. In this paper we investigate residential mobility among <b>slum</b> <b>dwellers</b> in Bhopal, India. Our analysis shows that one in five households succeeds in getting out of a slum settlement, and a major determinant is the household’s ability to save on a regular basis. Due to limited outreach of institutional housing finance, most <b>slum</b> <b>dwellers</b> rely solely on household savings for purchasing a house. These findings underscore the urgent need to improve savings instruments for <b>slum</b> <b>dwellers</b> and to downmarket housing finance to reach the poorest residents of rapidly growing cities in developing countries...|$|R

50|$|For SDI, {{the central}} {{participation}} {{of women is}} not just an ideal but a critical component of a gender-sensitive mobilization strategy, which sees men and women re-negotiating their relationships within families, communities, and organizational forms such as <b>slum</b> <b>dweller</b> “federations”. By prioritizing the leadership potential of women, federations alter traditional male domination in communities, in ways that actually strengthen grassroots leadership. Recognising that women are often the true engines of development, SDI uses the savings and credit methodology to develop their leadership capacity, financial management skills, and confidence. By entrusting women to handle such important monetary systems, whereby they are in charge of the precious savings of their neighbours and friends, communities begin to understand the potential of women as public decision-makers and powerful agents of change. In fact, savings and credit activities, apart from their clear financial benefits, serve as a means to bring women out of the home and into the public sphere in a manner that men rarely resent.|$|E
