40|$|Although {{accounting}} records {{are needed to}} facilitate the transaction of current business with commercial and financial agencies, we are here concerned primarily with their importance {{in connection with the}} internal administration of the business. Accounting data are probably the most important source of information for studying and analyzing the business. To be efficient, the management of a business must pay continuous attention to the behavior of important efficiency factors, such as mechanical losses, overruns, cost of assemblying and manufacturing butterfat, and factors that cause variations in such costs. Factors affecting the sales value of the product, such as costs of marketing, choice of market outlets, quality of the product and others, also affect a creamery’s competitive position in the industry. Since reliable accounting data are necessary in deciding managerial policies, analysis of the business becomes especially valuable when comparisons of important efficiency factors are made periodically and particularly when the results are compared with those of other creameries. Such comparisons, however, are likely to be significant only if the records are kept <b>on</b> a <b>uniform</b> <b>basis...</b>|$|R

The pi-calculus enjoys a singular position among computational calculi through its ability to embed sequential and concurrent programs as name passing processes without losing semantic information, and through its connection to other basic theories such as Linear Logic and Game Semantics. The embedding of programs in processes leads to the embedding of logics for programs in the logic for processes, where the observational content of a given program logic is made explicit, analysed and justified <b>on</b> a <b>uniform</b> <b>basis.</b> As a case study, we show embeddings of Hoare logic for sequential programs and a rely-guarantee logic for shared variable concurrency, suggesting that the proposed framework can offer a unifying basis to capture fundamental notions in program logics such as partial/total correctness, sequentiality and different kinds of concurrent computing.

It is particularly apposite at this time to consider these questions again for Scotland. Institutional change is proceeding apace within the UK financial sector, both with respect to the organisation and behaviour of the private sector, and also with respect to the policy environment within which it operates.

These elements are essential for the preparation of high-level strategic transport planning for the issue of energy as a whole, to help India make the right choices for the most suitable transportation systems. A relevant consideration {{at the base of}} this work is the high urbanization and motorization level in Indian metropolises in the last years. In order to provide an appropriate analysis on energy consumption, that is fully satisfactory from a methodological viewpoint and related to all transport systems, the well-to-wheel WTW index was adopted, taking into account that, especially in the urban context, that shorter journeys would easily be addressed by electric traction, while this is not taken for granted at all, according to the overall energy chain consumption and specific considerations on energy available in India when compared to Europe, which are included.

40|$|Summer air {{conditioning}} represents a growing market in buildings worldwide, with a particularly significant growth rate observed in European {{commercial and residential}} buildings. Heat-driven cooling technologies are available, {{which can be used}} in combination with solar thermal collectors to alleviate the burden caused by {{air conditioning}} on the electric utilities and the environment. Solar air conditioning has progressed considerably over the past years as a result of efforts toward environmental protection and new developments in components and systems, and significant experience has been gained from demonstration projects. The main obstacles for large scale application, beside the high first cost, are the lack of practical experience and acquaintance among architects, builders and planners with the design, control and operation of these systems. This paper describes the main results of the EU project SACE (Solar Air Conditioning in Europe), aimed to assess the state-of-the-art, future needs and overall prospects of solar cooling in Europe. A group of researchers from five countries has surveyed and analyzed over 50 solar-powered cooling projects in different climatic zones. The paper presents a short overview on the state-of-the-art and potential of solar-assisted cooling and air conditioning technologies. The results of the study, including a database of the surveyed projects, an evaluation of these projects <b>on</b> a <b>uniform</b> <b>basis,</b> an economic analysis tool, user guidelines and a multimedia tool [...] are presented.

30|$|The isolobal analogy {{allows us}} to relate and compare organic, {{inorganic}} and/or organometallic compounds <b>on</b> a <b>uniform</b> <b>basis.</b> Inversely, {{if we can find}} molecular fragments or building blocks that can replace each other in complex structures, we can conclude that they are isolobal. Therefore, the best way to examine and validate any (local) chemical similarity, discovered by chemical intuition and/or general concepts (based on isoelectronic or isovalent analogies) is the scheme demanded by the isolobal principle. The replacement BH→Si (1) and most of the analogies (1)-(7) involving (directly or indirectly) boron are special cases of a more general isolobal analogy which the author, scoptically and synoptically, has termed 'the boron connection'. This analogy provides a mechanism to predict new, hopefully stable, molecules and to compare molecular fragments {{with each other and with}} familiar species from organic chemistry and also offers clues about reactivity and reaction mechanisms. The boron connection is an attempt to map the structural chemistry of boranes and carboranes [26 – 31] to the structural chemistry of silicon [32] and silicon-carbon clusters, respectively. Boranes and carboranes constitute a very rich and well-established branch of chemistry with well-known structural and stability rules and powerful concepts [26 – 30]. Since boranes and borane-based molecular fragments and nano composites - including carboranes, bisboranes and metallaboranes - and metallacarboranes are very well studied [26 – 31, 33 – 35] and are very well known species with many technological, chemical and biomedical [33, 34] applications, their silicon, silicon-carbon (and other group 14, and 15) analogues [35, 36] are expected to be very important and very promising for analogous applications.|$|R

40|$|The energy {{consumption}} per capita per year throughout the world is increasing. With an increase in standard of living and world population, the demand for total energy is increasing rapidly and it is anticipated that the existing fossil fuels will be exhausted {{before the end of}} this century. More attention is being focused by the scientists and engineers throughout the world to develop potential methods that would use waste heat. A significant amount of low temperature (between 60 ° C and 99 ° C) heat is wasted annually in industrial process [1]. This waste heat could be used to drive absorption chillers, but it is not used since it lowers the Coefficient of Performance (C. O. P) of the system. One approach to a lower generator temperature involves the lowering of generator pressure. The dual-chamber vortex generator (DCVG) described in this thesis lowers the generator pressure {{as a consequence of the}} conservation of rotational momentum and permits an absorption chiller to function with improved capacity with relatively cooler sources of waste heat. DCVG is designed to replace current high temperature generators in commercial absorption chillers. For a proof of concept, a test stand has been designed and constructed for testing the performance of a vortex-assisted generator for use in absorption refrigeration systems. The scope of this thesis is to develop Absorption Refrigeration Evaluation Software (ARES) which would provide a performance evaluation for the test stand, based on experimental data taken. ARES also helps in the design and analysis of a conventional and conventional/vortex absorption refrigeration system and makes it possible to investigate various cycle configurations, to predict their performance and to compare them with each other <b>on</b> a <b>uniform</b> <b>basis.</b> ARES requires simple inputs consisting of the minimum information needed to define the system, based on these input values other operating parameters are calculated.
