40|$|Activity-based funding {{involves}} remunerating {{healthcare providers}} a fixed price per patient in each payment category. However, no categorisation system can account perfectly {{for differences in}} patient complexity. Differences may be systematic if providers routinely attract high-risk patients or engage in patient selection. Such differences may be evident in the English National Health Service (NHS) following the introduction of treatment centres that concentrate on providing {{a small number of}} high-volume procedures. We analyse data for more than 3. 3 million patients to assess whether the complexity of those treated in hospitals and treatment centres differs within twenty-nine payment categories, defined by Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs). We find that patients treated in hospitals were more likely to come from more deprived areas, to have more diagnoses and to undergo significantly more procedures than patients seen by treatment centres, suggesting that hospitals are treating more complex cases. If these observed differences between hospitals and treatment centres drive costs, then payments should be refined to ensure fair reimbursement.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess whether {{perinatal}} factors are associated with the risk of asthma in childhood in a register-based, nested case-control study in Finland. All children born between January 1, 1996, and April 30, 2004, who were entitled to a <b>special</b> <b>reimbursement</b> for antiasthmatic drugs (i. e., had diagnosed asthma by 2006 and had purchased inhaled corticosteroids or montelukast at least once), were identified (n 21, 038). For each case, one matched control child was selected. The associations between perinatal factors, derived from the Finnish Medical Birth Register, and the risk of asthma were analyzed by conditional logistic regression. In the final multivariate model, maternal asthma, young age, smoking, previous miscarriages, and a high number of previous deliveries, as well as cesarean section, low gestational age, and low ponderal index, were associated with an increased risk of asthma in children diagnosed before the age of 3 years. Among children diagnosed at the age of 3 years or later, maternal asthma, low gestational age, and low ponderal index were associated with an increased risk, and a high number of previous deliveries was associated with a decreased risk of asthma. In conclusion, perinatal factors play a role in the development of asthma in childhood, but the etiology may differ in early and late-onset asthma...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{incidence}} {{and risk of}} asthma among female cleaners employed in different industries was explored. An increased risk of asthma {{has been associated with}} the cleaning profession, in some but not all studies. All Finnish females employed as cleaners and all those employed in administrative work were followed for asthma incidence through a record linkage in 1986 – 1998. An individual was defined as an "incident case of asthma " if they received rights for <b>special</b> <b>reimbursement</b> of asthma medication from the national health insurance or were recognized as having occupational asthma. Age-adjusted relative risks (RR) were estimated for cleaners in comparison with those employed in administrative work. There were 2, 414 and 5, 235 cases of asthma among the cleaners and administrative workers, respectively. The RR was 1. 50 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 43 – 1. 57) in cleaners. The risk was increased in cleaners working in nearly all major sectors of economic activity, but cleaners employed by companies concerned with the manufacture of basic metals (RR 2. 47; 95 % CI 1. 68 – 3. 64) and food products (RR 2. 19; 95 % CI 1. 69 – 2. 85) had the highest risk. Only 25 of the "cases of asthma " among cleaners had been recognized as being occupational asthma. It could be concluded that cleaners have an increased risk of persistent adult-onset asthma. Factors inherent to the environment where cleaning is performed or differences in the cleaning agents used may explain the observed differences between industries...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to examine the initial, first-year anti-rheumatic outpatient therapy in patients with incident SLE, as well as the concomitant use of drugs for certain comorbidities, compared to the use in the general population. The Finnish nationwide register data on <b>special</b> <b>reimbursements</b> for medication costs was screened to identify the inception cohort of 566 adult SLE patients (87 % females, mean age 46. 5 +/- 15. 9 years) over the years 2000 - 2007. The patients were linked to the national Drug Purchase Register. Of those, 90 % had purchased at least once some disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) during the first year. Hydroxychloroquine was the most common (76 %), followed by azathioprine (15 %) and methotrexate (13 %). With the exception of increase in mycophenolate mofetil, the proportions remained stable over the whole study period 2000 - 2007. Drugs for cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and obstructive pulmonary disease were more frequently purchased than in the sex- and age-adjusted population, with rate ratios ranging from 1. 6 to 7. 8.

40|$|Background Sleep {{disturbance}} {{is suggested}} {{to contribute to}} the development of dementia. However, prospective longitudinal data from middle-aged populations are scarce. Methods We investigated a population-based sample of 2386 men aged 42 - 62 years at baseline during 1984 - 1989. Participants having a history of mental illnesses, psychiatric medication, Parkinson's disease or dementia within 2 years after baseline (n= 296) were excluded. Difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, sleep duration and daytime tiredness were enquired. Dementia diagnoses (n= 287) between 1984 and 2014 were obtained through linkage with hospital discharge, national death and <b>special</b> <b>reimbursement</b> registers. Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed for all dementias, and separately for Alzheimer's disease (n= 234) and other phenotypes (n= 53). Additional analyses were performed on a subsample of an apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype-tested population (n= 1199). Results The risk ratio for dementia was 1. 58 (95 % CI 1. 10 to 2. 27) in men with frequent sleep disturbance after adjustments for age, examination year, elevated depressive symptoms, physical activity, alcohol consumption, cumulative smoking history, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-sensitivity C reactive protein, cardiovascular disease history, education years and living alone. Daytime tiredness and sleep duration were not associated with dementia in adjusted analysis. In the APOE subsample, both APOE epsilon 4 genotype and frequent sleep disturbance were associated with increased dementia risk, but in the interaction analysis they had no joint effect. Conclusions Self-reported frequent sleep disturbance in middle-aged men may relate to the development of dementia in later life. Having an APOE e 4 genotype did not affect the relationship...|$|E

Methods: We investigated the association between AD and prevalent and incident hip fractures in an exposure-matched cohort study conducted in Finland 2002 – 2009 (the Medication and Alzheimer’s disease in 2005 study; MEDALZ- 2005). The study population included all community-dwelling persons with verified AD diagnosis in Finland on December 31, 2005 and one matched comparison person per AD case (N = 56, 186, mean age 79. 9 (SD 6. 8) years, range 42 – 101 years). The diagnosis of AD was extracted from a <b>special</b> <b>reimbursement</b> register. Data on hip fractures during 2002 – 2009 was extracted from the Finnish National hospital discharge register. Analyses of incident hip fractures (n = 2, 861) were restricted to years 2006 – 2009. Results: Persons with AD were twice as likely to have previous hip fracture in 2005 (odds ratio, 95 % confidence interval 2. 00, 1. 82 – 2. 20) than matched aged population without AD. They {{were also more likely to}} experience incident hip fracture during the four-year follow-up (hazard ratio, 95 % confidence interval 2. 57, 2. 32 – 2. 84, adjusted for health status, psychotropic drug and bisphosphonate use).

Objective of our {{study was to investigate}} prevalence of psychotropic drug use one year after diagnoses of Alzheimer׳s disease (AD), to compare prevalence to persons without AD and to assess changes in prevalence over time. Data from the MEDALZ (Medication use and Alzheimer׳s disease) cohort was utilized in the study including all 69, 080 community-dwelling persons with new diagnosis of AD during years 2005 – 2011 in Finland. Four age-, gender- and region of residence-matched persons without AD were identified for each case. Register-based data included prescription drug purchases and comorbidities from <b>Special</b> <b>Reimbursement</b> Register. Annual prevalence of psychotropic drug use one year after diagnosis was determined for each person. Psychotropic drugs were used by 53 % of persons with AD compared with 33 % of persons without AD during one year after diagnoses.

40|$|Abstract Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) {{infection}} may {{be associated}} with the development of asthma and atopy. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate this association and the related immunological mechanisms. Seventy-six children admitted to Oulu University Hospital in 1991 – 1994 for an RSV infection at an age of less than 12 months and healthy controls were called for a visit at the age of 6 – 10 years. Twenty subjects (26 %) had asthma compared with 12 controls (16 %) (difference 11 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) – 3 % to 24 %). Asthma had been diagnosed significantly earlier in the subjects. Eight per cent of the subjects had at least one positive skin prick test as compared with 43 % of the controls (difference – 35 %, 95 % CI – 50 % to – 19 %). Serum concentrations of interferon-γ and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 were significantly higher among the subjects than among the controls and among the subjects with asthma or current wheezing than among the corresponding controls. All children born in Finland in 1986 – 1995 were arranged in birth cohorts by month and year of birth and grouped by exposure to an RSV epidemic at age 0 – 6 months, resulting in 97 exposed and 23 unexposed cohorts. The proportions of children taking asthma medication or receiving <b>special</b> <b>reimbursement</b> for asthma medication in 1995 – 2002 were similar in the unexposed and exposed cohorts. Altogether 47 children born between August and November 2001 with a cord blood sample taken were admitted to hospital (n =  26) or seen in an outpatient department (n =  21) for RSV infection before the age of six months. Twenty-eight children had some other respiratory viral infection and 84 children formed a group of healthy controls. High scores on a factor combining the cord blood interleukin- 6 and interleukin- 8 responses (as derived by factor analysis) were shown in logistic regression analysis to predict hospitalization for RSV infection by comparison with the healthy controls (odds ratio 2. 29, 95 % CI 1. 21 to 4. 33).

40|$|In {{its current}} form, {{familial}} hypercholesterolemia (FH) {{is due to}} the presence at the heterozygous state of a mutant allele of the LDL receptor gene or of the APO gene. The patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) can only remove their LDL particles from the blood at about half the normal rate, leading to an approximate doubling of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) level, starting at birth and accumulating in many tissue resulting to tendon xanthomas, corneal arcus and early atherosclerosis (coronary heart diseases (CHD) occur typically at 35 - 55 years among men and at 55 - 75 years among women). In the early's 1990 's, our interest in the field was stimulated by the fact that despite the impressive progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of FH and a preferential r! egimen of reimbursement for statins in Belgium, many affected individuals were not diagnosed and adequately treated. In 1995, we initiated a project aimed to obtain objective information on the situation of subjects carrying familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in Belgium and to develop better means for identifying these subjects amongst the population. During the period 1995 - 2006, 1305 suspected FH patients originating from 682 families were examined for a DNA-based diagnosis in our laboratory and amongst these, 544 patients (271 families) were confirmed to have FH. Seventy three mutations in the LDLR as well as the unique mutation in APOB (R 3500 Q) explained their FH, but amongst them, five mutations explained about 38 % of FH in Wallonia and 4 mutations explained 29 % of FH in Flanders. Such establishment of the spectrum of FH causing mutations and particularly, of the specific mutational spectrum by region can greatly contribute to facilitate the diagnosis of FH in the near future. In our region, we found that FH frequency is likely to be higher than the theoretical prevalence reported in most European countries (1 / 500). That means that, in Belgium, each GP should know at least 1 FH patient. There are several reasons that advocated for the need to precisely diagnose FH. One of which was clearly demonstrated by two of our studies: in the category of patients with very elevated cholesterol levels (VHC) and family history of early CVD (FHEC), FH patients have always more severe atherosclerosis than age-, sex-, cholesterol- and family history-matched non-FH-individuals, suggesting that the FH status is by itself a strong and independent risk factor. In this category of VHC and FHEC patients, we even found a "paradox of FH" in {{the fact that they have}} greater atherosclerosis despite relatively lower risk as predicted by the Framingham equation. Genetic test may also enhance the awareness of a greater risk than expected on the basis of other risk factors. One of the main interests of genetic tests is of course to facilitate the screening in FH family. We also developed some specific criteria in term of cholesterol levels, family history of early CHD and tendon thickening to facilitate the diagnosis of FH in Belgium. These criteria could be used to select patients susceptible to be confirmed by more expensive genetic tests. As shown by our experience in our lipid clinics, the current available lipid-lowering drugs can correct LDL-C to target in about 49 % of the very high risk class of FH patients (including more than 80 % FH patients of our co! hort), a real success compared to the early 1990 's. In 2001, our work has contributed to the change of the reimbursement rules of statins in patients suspected of FH. Even if these new rules are not yet perfect, its positive point was that many more FH patients can now benefit of the <b>special</b> <b>reimbursement</b> compared to the situation before 2003. In conclusion, this works have illustrated many aspects regarding the existence, the frequency, the diagnostic problems and the clinical management of FH. Specially, our study suggest that FH remains underdiagnosed in despite of the fact that it is severe, can be diagnosed and effectively treated. For this reason, this work is not to be considered as a final point but rather as a "well fixed starting block" ready to support the beginning of more actions to improve the management of these FH patients at the higher level of public health.

40|$|Kroonisten tulehduksellisten suolistosairauksien (IBD) kaksi pääryhmää ovat haavainen paksusuolen tulehdus (UC) ja Crohnin tauti (CD). Haavaisen paksusuolen tulehduksen yleisin oire on veriripuli. Vastaavasti Crohnin taudin tyyppioireita ovat vatsakipu ja ripuli. Nämä etiologialtaan tuntemattomat suoliston krooniset tulehdussairaudet ovat lisääntyneet viimeisten vuosikymmenten aikana etenkin länsimaissa. Geneettisen alttiuden lisäksi sairauden puhkeamiseen vaikuttavat esimerkiksi ympäristötekijät. Etenkin lapsilla kroonisiin tulehduksellisiin suolistosairauksiin sairastuminen voi vaikuttaa laajalti kehitykseen aina pituuskasvusta elämänlaatuun. Tämän väitöskirjatutkimuksen tavoitteena oli selvittää lasten IBD:n ilmaantuvuus Suomessa vuosien 1987 ja 2003 välillä. Tavoitteena oli lisäksi tutkia ympäristötekijöiden vaikutusta ilmaantuvuuden alueellisiin eroihin. Lasten kroonisten suolistosairauksien taudinkuvaa, käytettyjä hoitomuotoja ja sairauden vaikutusta elämänlaatuun selvitettiin sairauskertomusten ja kyselytutkimuksen perusteella. Tulehduksellisten suolistosairauksien ilmaantuvuus kolminkertaistui suomalaisen lapsiväestön keskuudessa tutkimusjakson aikana. Alueilla, joissa on matala lapsiväestöntiheys, havaittiin suuremmat ilmaantuvuusluvut verrattuna alueisiin, joissa lapsiväestöntiheys on korkea. Maanviljelijöiden määrällä, merenrannan läheisyydellä, paperitehtaiden sijainnilla tai vesijohtoveden kemikaalipitoisuuksilla ei todettu olevan merkittävää vaikusta ilmaantuvuuden alueellisiin eroihin. Lapsilla taudinkuva on usein aggressiivinen; jopa joka viides lapsipotilas joutui leikkaukseen. Elämänlaadun havaittiin olevan alentunut varhaisaikuisuudessa verrattuna terveisiin ikätovereihin. Tulevaisuudessa onkin tärkeää selvittää lasten tulehduksellisten suolistosairauksien ilmaantuvuuden nopean kasvun taustalla olevia tekijöitä. Background: The {{incidence}} of {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) has been increasing among children especially in Western countries over the past decades. Crohn’s disease (CD) predominates over ulcerative colitis (UC) in most countries. The factors behind this increase are mainly unknown. Environmental factors influence, however, unquestionably the pathogenesis of IBD. The disease course in pediatric IBD is suggested to be more severe compared to adults which may have particularly impact on child development. The possible long-term sequelae of pediatric onset disease include growth impairment, risk of surgery and reduced quality of life. Objectives: This epidemiological study aimed to evaluate the {{incidence of}} IBD among Finnish children between the years 1987 - 2003. The role of environmental determinants (pediatric population density, agricultural industry, paper mills or sea shore close {{to the place of}} residence, north-south gradient and chemical concentrations of tap water) in the spatial variations of pediatric IBD was explored. Further, medical record data were applied in the characterization of the clinical picture. The long-term outcome of pediatric IBD patients was assessed by conducting a questionnaire survey among the patients diagnosed at Helsinki and Tampere university hospitals between years 1987 - 2003. Materials and methods: All children aged 0 - 17 years diagnosed with IBD in Finland between years 1987 - 2003 were identified through the Social Insurance Institution <b>special</b> <b>reimbursement</b> database. Information on residence was obtained from the Population Register Centre and population size data from Statistics Finland. Annual incidence rates per 100, 000 pediatric population and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution. The surface area of Finland was divided into squares of 250 x 250 m and regional differences were assessed. The databases of the two largest university hospitals in Finland were searched to collect the information on the clinical picture of the pediatric IBD diagnosed between years 1987 - 2003. In addition, a questionnaire on the health status was sent to the patients identified from the hospital files and to age- and sex-matched controls randomly selected from the Population Register Centre. Results: In total, 1880 children at the age of < 18 years were diagnosed with IBD in Finland during the 17 -year study period. The incidence of pediatric IBD increased three-fold from 4. 8 / 100, 000 in 1987 to 15. 0 / 100, 000 in 2003. The annual increase was on average 6. 5 % (95 % CI 5. 4 %- 7. 5 %). The analysis by IBD subtype was conducted only for years 1992 - 2003 due to incompleteness of the earlier data. The annual incidence of UC increased from 4 to 9 per 100, 000 and that of CD from 2 to 5 per 100, 000 during years 1992 - 2003. UC was more common than CD during the entire period. The average annual increase in CD was, however, higher compared to UC (8. 4 % versus 5. 2 %). There was no statistically significant north-south gradient in the incidence rates. In addition, chemical concentrations of tap water, agricultural industry and the closeness of the paper mill or seaside were not associated the incidence rates of pediatric IBD within the geographic units. Nevertheless, the incidence rates were significantly higher in the districts with sparse compared to dense child population. Of the patients identified from the hospital databases, the majority (52 %, n= 317) was diagnosed with UC. The proportion of CD was 34 % (n= 203) and IBD-unclassified 14 % (n= 83) respectively. Altogether 45 % of these children with IBD had received glucocorticoids as primary medication and 21 % were operated before age 18. Participation proportion of the questionnaire survey was 67 % (368 / 550) among patients and 37 % (646 / 1760) among controls. As much as 83 % of these patients had received systemic glucocorticoids during the disease course. The most common extraintestinal manifestation among the patients was a joint disease (in 5 % of the patients who completed the questionnaire). According to questionnaire responses, the patients with pediatric onset IBD had lower scores in all four questions assessing quality of life compared to the healthy controls although the difference was statistically significant only in overall quality of life and physical functioning. Moreover, the male patients were shorter and weighted less than the healthy controls. Conclusions: The incidence of pediatric IBD has substantially increased in Finland during 1987 - 2003. Moreover, the incidence rate of pediatric IBD was higher in the areas with low density of child population than in areas with high density of child population. The disease course of IBD among children is aggressive; systemic glucocorticoid therapy and surgical operations are frequent. In consequence, pediatric onset IBD reduces overall quality of life even in early adulthood when compared to overall quality of life in their healthy peers. ...|$|E
