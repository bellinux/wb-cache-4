5|$|It {{has since}} been {{demonstrated}} that the burials in Grave Circle A date from 16th century BC, before the traditional time of the Trojan War (13th-12th century BC), in which Agamemnon is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> participated.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{scholars}} have not shared {{the confidence of}} their Hellenistic counterparts, and today the Catalogue is {{generally considered to be}} a post-Hesiodic composition. Since Hesiod is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lived {{around the turn of the}} seventh century BCE, the Cyrene-Ehoie alone could guarantee that the poem was not his.|$|E

5|$|According to Jesús Pastor Paloma, an Agustinian Recollect priest, the {{structure}} was also <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a prefabricated retablo (reredos) altar, which was {{lost at sea}} when the ship carrying it from Belgium capsized in a storm; a wooden altar was made locally in its stead. Paloma {{also noted that the}} bottom part of the church was designed to resemble a ship's hull, so that it would sway during an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|At the Battle of Essling, Moustache was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> found a mate. Upon {{joining the}} front lines, a fellow Poodle was spotted amongst the enemy. During {{the course of}} the battle, the two met and the female Poodle {{accompanied}} Moustache back to the French camp. This relationship lasted about a year and together the pair produced puppies which were looked after by the women of the camp.|$|E
5|$|Either Offa or Ine of Wessex is {{traditionally}} <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> founded the Schola Saxonum in Rome, {{in what is}} today the Roman rione, or district, of Borgo.

5|$|Generally, the {{organization}} of JG 1 followed the standard Luftwaffe organization for any typical wing (Geschwader). It was commanded by a Geschwaderkommodore, equivalent to a USAAF Wing Commander or RAF Group Captain. A Geschwaderkommodore was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the rank of Lieutenant Colonel (Oberstleutnant) or Colonel (Oberst), but the position could be filled by a relatively junior officer.|$|E
5|$|In Tlingit and Haida cultures, raven {{was both}} a trickster and creator god. Related beliefs are {{widespread}} among the peoples of Siberia and northeast Asia. The Kamchatka Peninsula, for example, was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been created by the raven god Kutkh. There are several references to common ravens in the Old Testament of the Bible {{and it is an}} aspect of Mahakala in Bhutanese mythology.|$|E
5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–44. Three turbines were delivered by Brown Boveri in 1939 to Arkhangelsk for the Sovetskaya Rossiya, but the Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. A prototype boiler was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been built ashore for evaluation, {{but it was not}} completed until early 1941, which further complicated the production plan.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} dive bombing became so popular among the {{leadership}} of the Luftwaffe that it became almost obligatory in new aircraft designs. Later bomber models like the Junkers Ju 88 and the Dornier Do 217 were equipped for dive bombing. The Heinkel He 177 strategic bomber was initially <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> dive bombing capabilities, a requirement that contributed to the failure of the design, with the requirement not rescinded until September 1942 by Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring.|$|E
5|$|The warriors {{retreated to}} Prophetstown where, {{according}} to one chief's account, the warriors confronted Tenskwatawa. They accused him of deceit because of the many deaths, which his spells were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> prevented. He blamed his wife for desecrating his magic medicine and offered to cast a new spell; he insisted that the warriors launch a second attack, but they refused.|$|E
5|$|Andersen {{was accused}} of crimes on several {{occasions}} in the post-war years, but was most often acquitted in court. Amongst the crimes {{of which he was}} charged but acquitted in court was the theft of building materials in 1954. Another time he was tricked into lending his car to two people who broke into a goldsmith's shop in Tønsberg. Strongly intoxicated {{at the time of the}} crime, he was charged but fully acquitted. In 1955 he was, however, convicted and sentenced to 36days in prison for selling 30bottles of denatured alcohol, alcohol that was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been used at his factory.|$|E

5|$|Eventually {{a little}} after noon Wilton arrived at the inquest, and gave a full account of the incident. Lord Granville (half-brother of the Marquess of Stafford) told the jury that Huskisson had been {{suffering}} from numbness in his leg from a previous operation, and that this may have caused his apparent problems with movement. No witnesses recollected seeing any signal flags raised {{from any of the}} locomotives involved, including Rocket, although a system of warning flags was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been in place.|$|E
5|$|Harrison Ainsworth, in his 1842 novel Guy Fawkes, {{wrote about}} the local story that the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was planned by Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby in Ordsall Hall's Star Chamber. Guy Fawkes is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> escaped capture by the king's {{soldiers}} by way of an underground tunnel from Ordsall Hall to an inn at the cathedral end of Hanging Bridge, at {{the northern end of}} present-day Deansgate. There is no firm supporting evidence, but the Radclyffes were prominent Roman Catholics and were acquainted with the Catesby family. The legend is remembered {{in the name of the}} modern road that runs to the east of the hall, Guy Fawkes Street.|$|E
5|$|In 1797, Emerald was one {{of several}} vessels sent to hunt down and capture the {{crippled}} Santisima Trinidad, which had escaped from the British at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Emerald was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been present at the Battle of the Nile but in May 1798 a storm separated her from Horatio Nelson's squadron and she arrived in Aboukir Bay nine days too late. She was part of Rear-Admiral John Thomas Duckworth's squadron during the Action of 7 April 1800 off Cadiz.|$|E

These will form only two primary assemblies, and send only six deputies to the commune.|$|R

5|$|Margot Robbie {{auditioned for}} the role of Donna in 2008. The actress {{believed}} that she had performed badly in the audition and decided to leave for a five-week snowboarding holiday in Canada. Robbie had been in Canada for two days when she received a phone call telling her that she had been successful and that she had to return to Australia. Robbie began appearing on-screen in June of that year. Donna was originally <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a guest character role, but Robbie was promoted to regular cast member shortly after her debut.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November, the U.S. troops {{continued}} with {{their attempt to}} encircle Shōji's forces. On the west of Gavaga Creek, 1/7 and 2/164 extended their positions inland along the creek while 2/7 and other 164th troops took positions {{on the east side}} of Shōji's positions. The Americans began to compress the pocket while subjecting it to constant bombardment by artillery, mortars, and aircraft. A gap, however, existed by way of a swampy creek in the southern side of the American lines, which 2/164 was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> closed. Taking advantage of this route, Shōji's men began to escape the pocket.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2007, six AGM-129 ACM cruise missiles, each {{loaded with}} a W80-1 {{variable}} yield nuclear warhead, were mistakenly loaded onto a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52H heavy bomber at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and transported to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The nuclear warheads in the missiles were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been removed before the missiles {{were taken from}} their storage bunker. The missiles with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing, and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected by the various mandatory security precautions for nuclear weapons.|$|E
