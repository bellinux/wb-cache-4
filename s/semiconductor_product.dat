Its patented gate switch technology, called Muxcapacitor, is pre-regulation capacitive voltage reduction technology which uses cascading capacitors to more efficiently store power on a chip. Some capacitor banks are shut down when not in use, conserving power. The device also reduces the primary voltage through a transformer before the energy is processed for voltage and current adjustment and isolation. This reduces {{the size of the}} transformer and limits the need for secondary parts.

40|$|Accurate demand {{forecasting}} {{is a key}} {{capability for}} a manufacturing organization, more so, a semiconductor manufacturer. Many crucial decisions are based on demand forecasts. The semiconductor industry is characterized by very short product lifecycles (10 to 24 months) and extremely uncertain demand. The pace at which both the manufacturing technology and the product design changes, induce change in manufacturing throughput and potential demand. Well known methods like exponential smoothing, moving average, weighted moving average, ARMA, ARIMA, econometric methods and neural networks {{have been used in}} industry with varying degrees of success. We propose a novel forecasting technique which is based on Support Vector Regression (SVR). Specifically, we formulate ν-SVR models for <b>semiconductor</b> <b>product</b> demand data. We propose a 3 -phased input vector modeling approach to comprehend demand characteristics learnt while building a standard ARIMA model on the data. Forecasting Experimentations are done for different <b>semiconductor</b> <b>product</b> demand data like 32 & 64 bit CPU products, 32 bit Micro controller units, DSP for cellular products, NAND and NOR Flash Products. Demand data was provided by SRC(Semiconductor Research Consortium) Member Companies. Demand data was actual sales recorded at every month. Model performance is judged based on different performance metrics used in extant literature. Results of experimentation show that compared to other demand forecasting techniques ν-SVR can significantly reduce both mean absolute percentage errors and normalized mean-squared errors of forecasts. ν-SVR with our 3 -phased input vector modeling approach performs better than standard ARIMA and simple ν-SVR models in most of the cases...|$|E

40|$|Manufacturers {{address the}} {{distinct}} operational objectives of product innovation and manufacturing efficiency by having separate fabrication facilities (“fabs”) for development and manufacturing. Additionally, the industrial manufacture of a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>product</b> proceeds through several stages of production. These are typically {{a research and}} development (R&D) stage, a ramping stage, and a manufacturing stage. These production stages are distributed over the different fabs. These differences in fabrication environment and stage of production result in differences in the characteristics of production of a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>product</b> over its manufacturing lifetime. Some examples of these differences are device yield, breadth of processing conditions, throughput, number of reaction chambers operating in parallel, metrology, and data collection. These differences {{are reflected in the}} data available in the fab databases. This research explores the use of a neural network modeling and genetic algorithm optimization method with these different datasets. The focus is on a high-aspect-ratio etch process across the different fabs and production stages. Models are built from process input variables to post-process metrology, and from process input variables to yield metrics. In the latter case, there can be tens of processes occurring between the model input and output variables. I demonstrate the usefulness and industrial application of neural network process modeling and genetic algorithm recipe optimization by performing a reaction chamber matching exercise on a manufacturing line. The performance of a reaction chamber can deviate from target, either in terms of its post-process metrology or its associated yield metrics. The method developed herein generated an optimized recipe that brought the outlying behavior of a chamber closer to target and closer to that of the other chambers (“chamber matching”). This is one of many possible applications. It was chosen because it demonstrates both the fidelity of the process models and the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm. Ph. D...|$|E
