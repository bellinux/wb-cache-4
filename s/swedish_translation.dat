5|$|Modern Swedish (Swedish: nysvenska) {{begins with}} the advent of the {{printing}} press and the European Reformation. After assuming power, the new monarch Gustav Vasa ordered a <b>Swedish</b> <b>translation</b> of the Bible. The New Testament was published in 1526, followed by a full Bible translation in 1541, usually referred to as the Gustav Vasa Bible, a translation deemed so successful and influential that, with revisions incorporated in successive editions, it remained the most common Bible translation until 1917. The main translators were Laurentius Andreæ and the brothers Laurentius and Olaus Petri.|$|E

25|$|Olaus {{became known}} for his {{advocacy}} of Lutheranism and criticism of prevailing Roman Catholicism. In October 1524, the Uppsala Cathedral's chapter excommunicated both brothers on grounds of heresy. They remained, however, confident in the new Swedish king's strong support. In 1525 Olaus married, as Lutheran practice permitted, and also implemented another of Luther's ideas by having the mass sung in Swedish for the first time. Throughout this period Olaus was also involved in scholarly endeavors, including translating Lutheran works into Swedish. In 1526, Olaus published the first <b>Swedish</b> <b>translation</b> of the New Testament, and also published a catechism in Swedish.|$|E

500|$|Her passionate {{advocacy}} {{for the right}} of contemporary middle-class women to a solid education in housekeeping has led journalist and writer Ingrid Ärlemalm to describe Rückerschöld as a [...] "cautious feminist". In the letter in Allmänna Magazinet, she also shows signs of being well-read and familiar with contemporary literature on pedagogy with quotes from François Fénelon's Traité de l'education des filles ("Treatise on the Education of Girls"), which had been published in <b>Swedish</b> <b>translation</b> 1762. Like Rückerschöld, Fénelon strongly advocated household education to for young women.|$|E
500|$|Fujishima was {{particularly}} interested in the concept of a goddess [...] "as a job", and turned to Norse mythology as he felt that it was relatively unknown in Japan. Thus Belldandy is based on Verðandi (or Verthandi), the Norse Goddess of the present, (whose name is literally translated as [...] "to become" [...] or [...] "becoming"), and {{she is one of the}} three Norns or [...] "fates" [...] from Norse mythology. Verdandi, when translated into Japanese, becomes ベルダンディー (Berudandī). As the Japanese phonetic system does not distinguish between [...] "b" [...] and [...] "v" [...] or [...] "r" [...] and [...] "l" [...] (although ヴ can describe [...] "v".), [...] "Belldandy" [...] can emerge as a product of consonant substitutions. Indeed, it was in the first chapter of the manga that her name was transliterated as Belldandy rather than Verdandi, and this romanization has stuck since. When the English translations were being prepared, Toren Smith considered returning the name to [...] "Verthandi", (which Smith had determined to be the correct translation of the Old Norse), but chose to stick with Belldandy on the grounds that Fujishima was already [...] "playing fast and loose with the mythos" [...] and thus felt that no further harm was likely to come from employing Fujishima's transliteration. (Nevertheless, in the <b>Swedish</b> <b>translation</b> of the manga, released in 2007, her name was returned to Verdandi).|$|E

Olaus sent it to Sweden with a {{dedication}} to the dukes Eric, John, Magnus and Charles, Gustav's sons. It was subsequently republished several times.

2500|$|The novel {{has been}} translated, with {{various degrees of}} success, into at least 38 languages. Tolkien, an expert in philology, {{examined}} many of these translations, and made comments on each that reflect both the translation process and his work. As he was unhappy with some choices made by early translators, such as the <b>Swedish</b> <b>translation</b> by Åke Ohlmarks, Tolkien wrote a [...] "Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings" [...] (1967). Because The Lord of the Rings purports to be a translation of the fictitious Red Book of Westmarch, with the English language representing the Westron of the [...] "original", Tolkien suggested that translators attempt to capture the interplay between English and the invented nomenclature of the English work, and gave several examples along with general guidance.|$|E
2500|$|Rock {{bands of}} the 1970s were musically and lyrically {{inspired}} by the fantasy embracing counter-culture of the time; British 70s rock band Led Zeppelin recorded several songs that contain explicit references to The Lord of the Rings ("Ramble On", [...] "Misty Mountain Hop", [...] "The Battle of Evermore", and [...] "Over the Hills and Far Away"). In 1970, the Swedish musician Bo Hansson released an instrumental concept album {{based on the book}} titled Sagan om ringen (translated as [...] "The Saga of the Ring", which was the title of the <b>Swedish</b> <b>translation</b> of The Lord of the Rings at the time). The album was subsequently released internationally as Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings in 1972. The songs [...] "Rivendell" [...] and [...] "The Necromancer" [...] by the progressive rock band Rush were inspired by Tolkien. Styx also paid homage to Tolkien on their [...] "Pieces of Eight" [...] album with the song [...] "Lords of the Ring", while Black Sabbath's song, [...] "The Wizard", which appeared on their debut album, was influenced by Tolkien's hero, Gandalf. The heavy metal band Cirith Ungol took their name from a mountain pass in Middle-earth. Progressive rock group Camel paid homage to the text in their lengthy composition [...] "Nimrodel/The Procession/The White Rider", and Progressive rock band Barclay James Harvest was {{inspired by the}} character Galadriel to write a song by that name, and used [...] "Bombadil", the name of another character, as a pseudonym under which their 1972 single [...] "Breathless"/"When the City Sleeps" [...] was released; there are other references scattered through the BJH oeuvre.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of the strategies used for vocabulary teaching and learning in a multilingual adult education English classroom with recently arrived students in Sweden. Through classroom observations, an analysis of the textbook used, an interview with the teacher, and interviews with recently arrived students, several strategies and approaches to teaching or learning English vocabulary were found. The most common strategies for teaching vocabulary were to explain the word in the target language and to put it in context, although <b>Swedish</b> <b>translations</b> were also frequently used. Among the students’ strategies found were the use of dictionaries, flash cards, wordlists, and guessing from similar words in other languages. The students reported some difficulties with <b>Swedish</b> <b>translations</b> of English words and the use of Swedish in the classroom, albeit some also appreciated the opportunity to learn more Swedish. From these findings, some potential challenges for a multilingual classroom with recently arrived students were drawn...|$|R
5000|$|Taube {{released}} his first album in 1954; it included {{a cover of}} one of his father's songs. He has since released many albums which include songs written by his father. Several of his most well-known versions of Evert Taube songs come from albums recorded in the 1970s, but he recorded more of them at later stages, including his 2007 album Alderville Road. Referring to that album, reviewer Peter Dahlgren said, [...] "Evert had the yarns and Sven-Bertil had the voice."He has also recorded songs from Fredman's Epistles and Fredman's Songs by the popular Swedish 18th-century songwriter Carl Michael Bellman, and the poet Nils Ferlin (1898-1961), whose poems were mostly put to music by Lille Bror Söderlundh. Taube also recorded an album with songs by the Swedish songwriter and musician Ulf Peder Olrog, one with <b>Swedish</b> <b>translations</b> of songs by French songwriter Léo Ferré, and one with <b>Swedish</b> <b>translations</b> of songs by Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis.|$|R

40|$|Gender-inclusive {{language}} has been consciously applied {{in almost all}} significant English Bible translations over the last thirty years. It has only recently been introduced into <b>Swedish</b> Bible <b>translations</b> practices, however, with the test translation of Luke 9 : 51 – 19 : 28 and Galatians issued by the Swedish Bible Society. This fact signals that the next <b>Swedish</b> Bible <b>translation</b> will implement gender-inclusive language. This article describes three different types of gender-inclusive language that can be implemented cumulatively. The first, gender-accurate language, {{involves the use of}} gender-inclusive language in cases where the original text clearly refers to both men and women. The second type, gender-muted language, implements gender-inclusive language in all passages except those that exclusively refer to men. The third type, radically inclusive language, is found in those translations that seek to resist sexist language and be inclusive to all present readers even if that involves a departure from the meaning of the original text. Examples are given of how each type of gender-inclusive language can be implemented in <b>Swedish</b> <b>translations</b> of a number of New Testament passages...|$|R
