The studylookedat changes in fish communities from run-of-river HEP schemes compared with a set of control sites without hydropower across a range of river types and locations. The research showed that the impact of theseschemes on fish is limited, although the small number of samples means that subtle changes may not have been detected...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{deregulated}} electricity markets, {{the market}} price of electricity {{can be used to}} control power generation in order to obtain maximum revenue. This makes the building of smaller and smaller hydroelectric power stations economically feasible. High price of energy indicates that power demand is high relative to production capacity. Therefore, price-based optimization will enable the production of electricity when it is most needed. In this article, the feasibility of market price based control strategy for a <b>small-scale</b> <b>hydroelectric</b> power station is evaluated. An actual Finnish <b>small-scale</b> <b>hydroelectric</b> power plant is used {{as the basis for the}} modeling. Key words Distributed generation, electricity market, hydroelectric power generation, optimization...|$|R

The scheme commenced in 1922, {{and was the first}} state-owned <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>scheme</b> to generate electricity in mainland Australia, and among the first in the world to be remotely controlled. [...] For the first ten years of its operation it supplied on average 16.9% of electricity generated by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. [...] It is now owned and operated by AGL Energy and contributes approximately 0.02% of Victoria's energy supply.|$|R

40|$|Water {{resource}} managers {{must make}} decisions regarding minimum instream flow requirements for rivers, despite many uncertainties. Two important uncertainties concern (1) estimates of usable fish habitat at different discharges, and (2) {{effects of climate}} change on future stream discharge. I examined the implications of these two uncertainties for the North Alouette River, British Columbia (BC). Using the British Columbia Instream Flow Methodology, which is an assessment method for water diversions needed by <b>small-scale</b> <b>hydroelectric</b> projects, I found that uncertainty in habitat preferences of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fry generally dominated uncertainty in the results of the BCIFM when numerous transects were used. In contrast, for fewer than 15 transects, variation in physical habitat among sampled transects was the most important source of uncertainty. In addition, the increasing frequency of climate driven low-flow events suggests that operations of <b>small-scale</b> <b>hydroelectric</b> projects in BC may become more restricted in the future...|$|R
