The Office of Compliance (OOC), {{which is responsible for}} advancing safety, health, and workplace rights in the legislative branch, and the tunnel workers had raised concerns about health and safety issues in the tunnels. As a result of these concerns, in January 2006, OOC issued citations for and asked AOC to address a potential asbestos hazard and heat stress conditions in the tunnels. In addition, in February 2006, OOC filed a complaint against AOC concerning hazards in the tunnels, including falling concrete, an inadequate communication system for these confined spaces, and inadequate escape exits (egresses). According to OOC officials, these conditions had been brought to AOC's attention by OOC inspectors as early as 1999, but AOC had not made sufficient progress in addressing them, and conditions in the tunnels had deteriorated further. In June 2007, AOC reached a settlement agreement with OOC to resolve both the citations and the complaint. The settlement agreement calls for the problems in the tunnels to be resolved within 5 years of the settlement date. This testimony focuses on the projects and other steps AOC is taking to address the tunnel problems and the current schedule and estimated costs for the tunnel projects. ...|$|R

The Office of Compliance (OOC), {{which is responsible for}} advancing safety, health, and workplace rights in the legislative branch, and the tunnel workers have raised concerns about health and safety issues in the tunnels. Specifically, in March 2006, the utility tunnel workers sent a letter to Congress complaining of unsafe working conditions in the tunnels, including falling concrete, asbestos, and extreme heat. In February 2006, OOC filed a complaint against AOC concerning hazards in the tunnels, including falling concrete, an inadequate communication system for these confined spaces, and inadequate escape exits. According to OOC officials, these conditions had been previously {{brought to the attention of}} AOC by OOC inspectors as early as 1999. Following a reinspection in mid- 2005, OOC determined that AOC had not made sufficient progress in addressing them and that conditions in the tunnels had deteriorated further. In addition, in January 2006, OOC issued citations for and asked AOC to address a potential asbestos hazard and heat stress conditions. In light of these concerns, Congress asked us to review the condition of the tunnels. Accordingly, we examined (1) the current condition of the tunnels, (2) AOC's plan for making repairs and improvements to the tunnels, and (3) the responsiveness of AOC's plan to the issues raised by OOC and the tunnel workers. ...|$|R

Simulointimalli valmistettiin vastaamaan Helsingin Energian Vuosaari B:n voimalaitoksen lämmöntalteenottokattilaa, joka toimii kahdella painetasolla. Kattila on Foster Wheelerin valmistama. Ennen mallinnuksen aloittamista tutustuttiin laitoksen termodynamiikkaan, jolloin saatiin riittävä teoreettinen tieto koko laitoksen toiminnasta. Kattilan reunaehtoina ovat kaasuturbiiniprosessi ja laitoksen höyrykierto. Kaasuturbiini korvattiin laskentayhtälöillä, jotka antavat alkuarvot mm. savukaasun massavirralle ja lämpötilalle ennen kattilaa kaasuturbiinin tehon funktiona. Kattila liitetään höyrykiertoon tuorehöyry- ja syöttövesilinjasta, jolloin reunaehtoina annetaan lämpötilat ja paineet massavirroille. Valmistettua mallia testattiin ylösajo- ja kuormanmuutostilanteessa. Ylösajotilanteessa saatuja laskentatuloksia verrattiin todellisen laitoksen mittaustuloksiin, jolloin varmistuttiin simulointimallin oikeasta fysikaalisesta toiminnasta. Kuormanmuutostilanteissa kaasuturbiinin tehoa muutettiin ja samalla seurattiin kattilan reagointia muutostilanteessa. Kuormanmuutosmittauksessa varmistettiin vielä, että kattila reagoi kuormanmuutokseen oikealla tavalla, eikä muutos aiheuta kattilan toiminnalle haitallista värähtelyä. A heat {{recovery}} steam generator, HRSG, of a combined cycle is modeled {{in this work}} by Apros. The simulation model is made to meet {{the characteristics of the}} HRSG, working on two pressure levels, at Vuosaari B power plant owned by Helsingin Energia. The HRSG is manufactured by Foster Wheeler. Before beginning modeling works the author familiarized oneself with the thermodynamics of the whole plant, during which necessary theoretical knowledge of function of the whole plant was received. The gas turbine process <b>and</b> the <b>steam</b> cycle are the boundary conditions of the HRSG. Gas turbine was replaced by equations, which gives the initial values for example to the mass flow and temperature of the flue gas before the HRSG as function {{of the power of the}} gas turbine. The HRSG was connected to the steam cycle at living <b>steam</b> <b>and</b> feed <b>water</b> <b>pipes,</b> to which temperature and pressure was given as initial values. The model was tested in start-up and load change. The results calculated by the model were compared with the measured ones of the real plant, so it came evident, that the physical functions of the model were correct. In load change situation the power of the gas turbine was changed, and the reactions of the HRSG was examined. In load change situation reassured, that the HRSG reacts in correct way to changes and the change doesn't cause any harmful oscillation in the HRSG...|$|R
40|$|The K- 700 Power House area, {{initially}} {{built to}} supply {{power to the}} K- 25 gaseous diffusion plant was shutdown and disassembled in the 1960 s. This shutdown was initiated by TVA supplying economical power to the diffusion plant complex. As a result of world wide over production of enriched, reactor grade U{sup 235 }, the K- 27 switch yard and switch house area was placed in standby in 1985. Subsequently, as the future production requirements decreased, the cost of production increased and the separation technologies for other processes improved, the facility was permanently shutdown in December, 1987. This Site Characterization Report {{is a part of}} the FY- 88 engineering Feasibility Study for placing ORGDP Gaseous Diffusion Process facilities in 'Permanent Shutdown'. It is sponsored by the Department of Energy through Virgil Lowery of Headquarters [...] Enrichment and through Don Cox of ORO [...] Enrichment Operations. The primary purpose of these building or site characterization reports is to document, quantify, and map the following potential problems: Asbestos; PCB containing fluids; Oils, coolants, and chemicals; and External contamination. With the documented quantification of the concerns (problems) the Engineering Feasibility Study will then proceed with examining the potential solutions. For this study, permanent shutdown is defined as the securing and/or conditioning of each facility to provide 20 years of safe service with minimal expenditures and, where feasible, also serving DOE's needs for long-term warehousing or other such low-risk use. The K- 700 power house series of buildings were either masonry construction or a mix of masonry and wood. The power generating equipment was removed and sold as salvage in the mid 1960 s but the buildings and auxiliary equipment were left intact. The nine ancillary buildings in the power house area use early in the Manhattan Project for special research projects, were left intact minus the original special equipment. During the late 1960 s and 1970 s, some of the abandoned buildings were used for offices, special projects, and storage. Some of the remaining electrical transformers contain PCBs in concentrations less than 500 ppm. Many of the <b>steam</b> <b>and</b> hot <b>water</b> <b>pipes</b> in the buildings are insulated with asbestos insulation, but none of the equipment or buildings have high counts of surface radioactive contamination. The general conditions of the buildings are from fair to poor. Many should be boarded-up to prevent personnel entry and in some cases demolitions would be the safer alternative...|$|R
