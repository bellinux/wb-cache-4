The carpet tunicate (Didemnum vexillum) has taken over a [...] area of the seabed on the Georges Bank off the northeast coast of North America, covering stones, molluscs, and other stationary objects in a dense mat.

6000|$|On {{the whole}} the {{character}} of this coast seems to be well expressed by Lieutenant Wilkes, when he says--"Nothing can exceed the beauty of these waters, and their safety; not a shoal exists within the straits of Juan de Fuca, Admiralty Inlet, Puget's <b>Sound,</b> or <b>Hood's</b> Canal that can in any way interrupt their navigation by a 74 gun ship. I venture nothing in saying there is no {{country in the world}} that possesses waters equal to these." ...|$|R

The Puget <b>Sound</b> populations (<b>Hood</b> Canal and Utsaladdy) were {{more similar to}} each other compared to the ocean populations. The Hood Canal and Utsaladdy smelt exhibited least distance function, D^ 2, and greater overlap of meristic characters compared to the Lapush fish.

50|$|Research showed that, at depths up to {{at least}} 10m (30 feet), divers' wetsuit hoods lessened {{underwater}} hearing sensitivity by 10 to 35 decibels at 1000 Hz and above, and by little or nothing at 250 Hz and below. With increasing depth in a hyperbaric chamber, decreases in wetsuit <b>hood</b> <b>sound</b> attenuation appear only to occur at frequencies between 500 and 1500 Hz. In the open ocean, hood attenuation at 8,000 Hz showed a significant decrease at 60 fsw and a tendency to decrease at 2,000 and 4,000 Hz compared with the 10 fsw data at the same frequencies in the chamber trials. At frequencies from 500 - 4,000 Hz wetsuit <b>hood</b> <b>sound</b> attenuation was on average 8 dB lower in the ocean than in the chamber trials.|$|R

All these ran to Robin and kissed his hands and his clothing, with great sound of weeping.|$|R
5000|$|Robert Hood {{describes}} {{the situation in}} the early 1990s as one where techno had become too [...] "ravey", with increasing tempos leading to the emergence of gabber. Such trends saw the demise of the soul-infused techno that typified the original Detroit <b>sound.</b> Robert <b>Hood</b> has noted that he and Daniel Bell both realized something was missing from techno in the post-rave era, and saw that an important feature of the original techno sound had been lost. Hood states that [...] "it sounded great from a production standpoint, but there was a 'jack' element in the old structure. People would complain that there's no funk, no feeling in techno anymore, and the easy escape is to put a vocalist and some piano on top to fill the emotional gap. I thought {{it was time for a}} return to the original underground." ...|$|R

Their breeding and summer range extends from the coastal mountains of Alaska to California, along the northern Rocky Mountains to northwestern Wyoming, and along the north Atlantic Coast, southern Greenland, and Iceland (Bellrose 1980). In Washington, harlequins historically breed in the Olympic Mountains, the Cascades, and the Blue and Selkirk Mountains (see Figure 1; Jewett et al. 1953, Schirato 1994); however, {{their presence in the}} Blue Mountains is now in question (Schirato 1994).

50|$|At one time, Washington {{state had}} the {{distinction}} of having more nuclear warheads than {{four of the six}} known nuclear-armed nations. These warheads were concentrated in two places: at Fairchild AFB and at the Kitsap Submarine Base across Puget <b>Sound,</b> on the <b>Hood</b> Canal. At Fairchild, 85 nuclear gravity bombs (25 B61-7 gravity bombs and 60 B83 gravity bombs) were stored in a reserve nuclear depot. Bangor's eight submarines have 24 Trident I missiles per boat with eight warheads per missile, for a total of 1,536. These bombs were removed from the base {{by the end of the}} 1990s. In one instance of nuclear warhead transportation in the mid 1980s, while loading it into an airplane, one of the warheads slipped off the loader and landed onto the runway. Luckily, the warhead was not armed, so it did not detonate. North Dakota had a similar nuclear strength during the Cold War, with both SAC bases at Minot and Grand Forks equipped with B-52 bombers and Minuteman missiles. Grand Forks relinquished its nuclear role, but Minot continues.|$|R
40|$|There is good {{potential}} {{for use of}} Reclaimed fibers such as cotton, Polyester in moldable nonwoven materials for automotive applications. Variety of automotive parts, such as headliner, wall panels, trunk liners, parcel shelves, and <b>hood</b> <b>sound</b> insulators with excellent shape stability can be manufactured by conventional techniques. These fibers are coupled with economic and environmental benefits. The thermal insulation properties of the nonwoven materials were determined, in accordance with ASTM, using the new thermal conductivity tester. The experimental data show that thermal insulation properties of the nonwoven materials vary significantly, {{depending on the type}} of Reclaimed fibre [...] This research work starts with opening and segregating the reclaimed fibers. Later the fibers get transformed to a non-woven, by passing it through a sequence of operations, which encompass the mechanical web laying technique, the aerodynamic principle and chemical bonding. The focus of this research is to produce compostable used fibre based non-woven. These non-woven disposed off after their intended use in an eco-friendly way. Implementing this innovative method reduces the production cost of automobile interior products...|$|R
