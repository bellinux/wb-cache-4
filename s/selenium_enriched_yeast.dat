Selenols were also derivatized with a mercury tag, p-hydroxymercurybenzoate (PHMB). The selenol-PHMB complexes showed the overlapped isotopic patterns of selenium and mercury, which provided supporting information for the identification of selenols. Both methods showed good agreement (< 4 ppm difference) between the theoretical masses of the target compounds and the measured masses in the yeast matrix. The method using IAA as the derivatizing reagent was used to study the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to three forms of selenium, Se-Met, Na 2 SeO 3 (Se(IV)), and Na 2 SeO 4710 H 2 O (Se(VI)) (concentration of Se: 100 mg/L).

40|$|The {{essential}} trace mineral, selenium, is of fun-damental {{importance to}} human health (Rayman, 2000, 2004). Selenium {{is known to have}} important roles in reproductive functions and development, immunocompetence and ageing. As a constituent of selenoproteins, selenium has structural and en-zymic roles, in the latter context being best-known as an antioxidant and catalyst for the production of an active thyroid hormone. Selenium is a com-ponent of the cell enzyme glutathione peroxidase (Mills, 1957). The Se content of animal feed ingre-dients is dependent on the Se concentration in soil. The Se reserve in soils was depleted in the Czech Republic (Pavlata et al., 2000). Se intake is lower than the recommended daily allowance: 55 – 70 µg (Velíšek, 2002). Therefore {{there is a need to}} in-crease Se consumption in the general population and selenium should be supplemented in the form in which it naturally occurs in foods. The amount of Se available for assimilation by the tissues is dependent on the form and concentration of the element while organic selenium is deposited in the breast muscle more efficiently than inorganic selenium (Choct et al., 2004). Inorganic and organic forms of Se (selenite, selenate, selenide, selenom-ethionine, <b>selenium</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>yeast,</b> selenium en-riched alga) may be used as supplements.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Selenium</b> (Se) <b>enriched</b> <b>yeast,</b> {{produced}} by growing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in Se rich media, is a recognized source of organic food-form of Se. Effects of culture conditions (temperature, fermentation time, initial pH value, shaking speed, {{as well as}} time and concentration of Se added to medium) on the bioaccumulation of Se in yeast were investigated by Plackett-Burman design in this paper. Fermentation was carried out at different temperature (28 - 30 °C), initial pH value (4. 5 - 5. 8), shaking speed (130 - 160 rpm), fermentation time (24 - 48 h), size of inoculums (30 - 60 g/l), Se concentration (15 - 25 µg/ml) and time of Se addition (0 - 9 h). The results showed total Se accumulation and organic Se formation ranges of 107. 9 to 287. 6 mg/kg and 93. 27 to 269. 05 mg/kg, respectively. The most suitable conditions for total and organic Se incorporation in yeast were: addition of sodium selenite 25 µg/ml, at 9 h after inoculation, inoculums size of 30 g/l, temperature 28 °C, initial pH value 5. 8, shaking speed 130 rpm and incubation time of 48 h...|$|R

Forty-eight Apennine lambs 30 day old(12. 78 ± 0. 94 kg) received, during a 63 day period, a total mixed ration (TMR) which was either Se unsupplemented(Control group - background only- 0. 13 mg/kg Se) or supplemented with Na selenite (0. 30 mg/kg Se as sodium selenite) or <b>selenium</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>yeast</b> (0. 30 mg/kg and 0. 45 mg/kg Se as Se-yeast). Growth performance, feed to gain ratio, carcass and meat quality (pH, drip and cooking losses, colour,GSH-Px activity and chemical analysis) did not show any difference between the treatments. Meat colourand oxidative stability during 9 days of refrigerated storage were unaffected by dietary supplementation,suggesting that, at the levels of Se used in this experiment, dietary Se, even from an organic source, hadlimited potential for reducing lipid oxidation. Selenium supplementation raised the Se content in muscle(P < 0. 001) with the greatest increase when Se-yeast was fed. Although selenite increased total Se, it didnot influence total or specific selenoamino-acids in this tissue. On the contrary, Se-yeast supplementationled to an increase in muscle Se-methionine content.

The effects of milk from these dairy cows on selected immunological traits in the blood and spleen and on Se levels in serum of 30 weaned piglets were also analysed. Ten piglets were divided into controlmilk (Control), AS-milk and OS-milk groups from weaning for 14 days. The cow milk was frozen until reheated to 38 °C {{on the day of}} feeding to the piglets. Blood samples of cows and calves were used for lymphocyte phenotyping and measuring phagocytosis activity and lymphocyte proliferation. The lymphocyte phenotyping and the phagocytosis were done for milk of cows and blood samples of piglets, whereas the spleen was analysed for the lymphocyte subpopulations. Parallel to this study blood and milk samples from the cow trial were analysed for Se content and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant capacity (TEAC). The OS and AS groups had different Se contents and TEAC values in blood and TEAC values in milk compared to Control. In milk only OS were different for Se content from AS and Control. Lymphocyte subpopulations, lymphocyte proliferation and phagocytosis activity were not affected by different Se sources, neither in cows nor in calves. Immune cells produce more radicals only during an infection, it is unclear, whether phagocytosis activity would be enhanced by the higher TEAC values of Se groups. The next step would be a challenge trial. The selected immunological parameters in the piglet trial were not influenced by different Se milks.

Consumption of broiler meat is increasing, and the meat content of selenium and omega- 3 fatty acids {{are affected by}} the composition of broiler feed. A two-way analyses of variance was used to study the effect of feed containing omega- 3 rich plant oils and <b>selenium</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>yeast</b> on broiler meat composition, antioxidation- and sensory parameters. Four different wheat-based dietary treatments supplemented with 5 % rapeseed oil or 4 % rapeseed oil plus 1 % linseed oil, and either 0. 50 mg selenium or 0. 84 mg selenium (organic form) per kg diet was fed to newly hatched broilers for 22 days. Results The different dietary treatments gave distinct different concentrations of selenium and fatty acids in thigh muscle; one percent linseed oil in the diet increased the concentration of the omega- 3 fatty acids 18 : 3, 20 : 5 and 22 : 5, and 0. 84 mg selenium per kg diet gave muscle selenium concentration at the same level as is in fish muscle (0. 39 mg/kg muscle). The high selenium intake also resulted in increased concentration of the long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids EPA (20 : 5), DPA (22 : 5) and DHA (22 : 6), thus it may be speculated if high dietary selenium might have a role in increasing the concentration of EPA, DPA and DHA in tissues after intake of plant oils contning omega- 3 fatty acids. Conclusion Moderate modifications of broiler feed may give a healthier broiler meat, having increased content of selenium and omega- 3 fatty acids. High intakes of selenium (organic form) may increase the concentration of very long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids in muscle. </p...|$|E

Linseed oil, independent of accompanying dietary fat source, lead to increased levels of the n- 3 EPA, DPA and DHA and reduced levels of the n- 6 arachidonic acid (AA). The ratio between AA/EPA was reduced from 19 / 1 in the soybean oil dietary groups to 1. 7 / 1 in the linseed oil dietary groups. Dietary red palm oil reduced total chicken plasma cholesterol levels. There were no differences between the dietary groups with regard to measured meat antioxidant capacity or sensory evaluation. Chicken meat selenium levels were clearly influenced by dietary selenium levels, but were not influenced by feed fatty acid composition. High dietary selenium level lead to marginally increased n- 3 EPA and higher meat fat % in breast muscle but did not influence the other LC PUFA levels. Chicken breast meat nutritional value from the soybean oil and low selenium dietary groups may be regarded as less beneficial compared to the breast meat from the linseed oil and high selenium dietary groups.

50|$|The disease got {{its name}} from the {{province}} in which it was discovered: Keshan, China. Since its discovery, it can also be found in New Zealand and Finland. Keshan disease results from a selenium deficiency which is a nutrient we receive in our diet from eating foods that were grown in <b>selenium</b> <b>enriched</b> soils. Because of that factor, Keshan deficiency can be found anywhere that the level of selenium present in the soil is low. An individual with Keshan disease will have an abnormally large heart. Keshan disease can also lead to higher rates of cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and strokes. In addition, an individual can experience eczema, psoriasis, arthritis, cataracts, alcoholism, and infections.|$|R

40|$|Background: IMOD™, a <b>selenium</b> <b>enriched</b> extract of {{the plants}} Tanacetum vulgare, Urtica dioica, and Rosa canina, has an {{excellent}} effect on oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the radioprotective effects of this immunomodulatory drug on human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Methods: Peripheral blood samples obtained from venipuncture of the brachial vein were treated with IMOD™ (5, 10, 15, 20 μl) for 30 min and Cobalt 60 γ-rays (0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2 Gy) as the test groups and cultured with the control. We used the micronuclei assay, cell death detection, and cell toxicity assay to analyze the treatment effects. Results: The frequency of micronuclei were 1. 66 (0 Gy), 5. 33 (0. 25 Gy), 9. 67 (0. 5 Gy), 17. 67 (1 Gy), and 23. 67 (2 Gy) in the irradiated lymphocytes (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Very High Gravity fermentations are an {{increasingly}} attractive proposition within the brewing {{industry as a}} means of energy saving and optimising process efficiency. However, the use of very high gravity (> 20 °P) wort is associated with a range of biological stress factors. Ethanoic and osmotic stresses have been widely analysed along with oxidative stress in relation to propagation and early stage fermentation. The aim of this research was to investigate the impact of wort gravity on oxidative stress, and understand how this affects the plasma membrane at VHG. Finally the effect altered ergosterol content was analysed. The characteristics of Saccharomyces pastorianus strains were assessed for their ability to withstand the increased pressures of VHG (22 °P) fermentations. VHG fermentations showed increase ethanol production at the expense of fermentation length, and increased ethanol production during VHG fermentations was offset by an increase in fermentation length. All fermentations were observed to accumulate ROS and increased antioxidant levels, with levels being furtherelevated in the VHG environment. Further analysis of S. pastorianus strains indicated that the levels of oxidative stress observed in fermentation had a negative effect on membrane fluidity and increased damage of the plasma membrane was observed. Analysis of ergosterol <b>enriched</b> <b>yeast</b> indicated that although fermentation rate was increased, a trade off with alcohol and biomass production was observed. Furthermore in response to oxidative stress, ergosterol <b>enriched</b> <b>yeast</b> showed reduced tolerance, decreased membrane fluidity and increased membrane damage. This work will give further insight into the response of lager yeast to oxidative stress present during VHG fermentations...|$|R

There are good possibilities both in {{cultivation of plants}} and in animal husbandry on plough- and grasslands. Hungary's share and its competitive position, however, decreased on European and world market in the past years. Therefore our research was focused on developing new animal products meeting the changing consumers' demands by their nutritional benefits and by their natural way of production. The study highlights four product s, namely goose - liver produced by considerately fatten up, rabbit meat with low fat and cholesterol levels, beef rich in omega - 3 fatty acids and <b>selenium</b> <b>enriched</b> eggs.

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that dietary {{manipulation}} could be done to enrich the specific nutrient component or composition in tissues of farm animals. The key objectives of this project were to examine whether the selenium and iron contents in fresh pork can be enriched by dietary manipulation, and to evaluate the bioavailability and protective efficacy of Se-enriched pork against chemically-induced colorectal cancer in an animal model. Outcomes of the project: Feeding of organic selenium supplement significantly increased selenium content of pork compared with the control pigs that were fed wheat based ration. Feeding of organic iron supplement did not increase iron content in pork, however the female pigs had greater level of iron in pork than the male counterparts. <b>Selenium</b> <b>enriched</b> pork significantly reduced the number of putative preneoplastic lesions in colon tissues of rats induced with azoxymethane compared with rats fed the control or normal pork diets.

In this paper, we present a scalable structure based on 3 D wells with approximately unity height-to-width ratios (based on tubes with electrodes on the sides), which is capable of <b>enriching</b> <b>yeast</b> cell populations whilst ensuring that up to 94. 3 % of cells processed through the device can be collected in tubes beyond the output...|$|R
40|$|The sample under {{investigation}} {{in this project}} is an experimental chromium <b>enriched</b> <b>yeast</b> used as a possible additive in animal foodstuff, which was produced by growing yeast {{in the presence of}} chromium (III) chloride. Chromium on its own in not biologically active but chromium in the form of chromium <b>enriched</b> <b>yeast</b> is biologically active. The objective of this project was to show the complete absence of chromium(VI) from the sample. A literature survey describing previous work carried out on the speciation of Cr(VI) has been carried out. The principal methods of detection of Cr(VI) used in this project are Polarography, G. F. A. A. Spectroscopy, U. V. Spectroscopy and H. P. L. C. For each of the above methods a calibration curve was obtained and each method was applied to the yeast extract. The H. P. L. C. and U. V. spectroscopic method are specific for Cr(VI) but polarography and G. F. A. A. spectroscopy measure total chromium. Tris-NaOH buffer has been investigated for the extraction of chromium(VT). Problems associated with air oxidation of Cr(III) in alkaline solution have identified and procedures described for the suppression of air oxidation. Procedures are described for the application of the extraction procedure to the yeast extract and for the determination of Cr(VI) in the extract. Procedures are also described for the preconcentration of Cr(VI) on a HPLC column and for the application to the yeast extract. The rate of reduction of Cr(VI) by ascorbic acid is investigated and found to be first order with respect to ascorbic acid concentration. The reduction capacity of the yeast is also investigated and it was found that in acid solution the yeast will reduce Cr(VI) but in neutral or basic solution the reduction capacity is diminished.

40|$|The {{fermentation}} conditions of selenium enrichment by Candida utilis were studied. Based {{on the results}} of the single factor experiment, three factors including the concentration of sodium selenite, inital pH and incubation temperature were selected. The response surface method was used to optimize the various factors. The optimal conditions were obtained as follows: incubation time was 30 h, time of adding selenium was mid-logarithmic, the sodium selenite concentration was 35 mg·L- 1 with inital pH of 6. 6, incubation concentration of 10 %, incubation temperature of 27 ℃, the medium volume of 150 mL/ 500 mL, respectively. Under the optimal condition, the biomass was 6. 87 g·L- 1. The total selenium content of Candida utilis was 12 639. 7 μg·L- 1, and the selenium content of the cells was 1 839. 8 μg·g- 1, in which sodium selenite conversion rate was 79. 1 % and the organic selenium was higher than 90 %.

40|$|Selenium {{is one of}} {{the most}} vital trace {{elements}} regulating various body functions. Herein, we observe the effects of selenium-enriched probiotics on heart lesion in broiler chickens under high ambient temperature and explore the underlying mechanisms. Four different groups of broiler chickens were fed a corn-soybean basal diet having no Se supplementation (Con group), basal diet with the addition of probiotics (P group), a basal diet with Se supplementation in the form of sodium selenite (SS group, 0. 30 mg Se/kg) and basal diet with the addition of <b>selenium</b> <b>enriched</b> probiotics (SP group, 0. 30 mg Se/kg). The results showed that P, SS, or SP supplementation significantly (P< 0. 05) up-regulated mRNA expression of selenoproteins (GPx 1, GPx 4) and down-regulated heat shock proteins (Hsp 60, Hsp 70 and Hsp 90) in heart as compared to Con, P and SS diets. Herein, we suggest that SP product can serve as a feasible nutritive supplement, capable of protecting the heart from toxic effect of oxidative stress in summer season. ...|$|R

40|$|Garlic {{has been}} touted for its {{medicinal}} properties {{in almost all}} ancient cultures. It belongs to the Allium family all members of which contain sulfur. Garlic contains an abundance of sulfur amino acids and their derivatives. The processing of these compounds through various preparations is what causes the odor of garlic. These garlic constituents {{have been shown to}} influence both initiation and promotion phases of cancer in several animal and cell culture methods. It has been found that these components exert antiproliferative activity on normal and malignant cells. Furthermore garlic compounds have been shown to block the synthesis of N-nitroso compounds that function as potential carcinogens. In this review, several carcinomas have been examined with respect to garlic’s ability to produce prevention. These include colon, esophagus, lung, prostate, and breast. On a side note, <b>selenium</b> <b>enriched</b> food products {{have been shown to be}} effective in cancer prevention. Interestingly enough, garlic has a great capacity to concentrate selenium when grown in a selenium-fertilized condition, which makes it a great candidate for food fortification.

40|$|Use of <b>selenium</b> <b>enriched</b> foods, {{supplements}} and fertilizers has increased markedly {{in recent years}} in the US and other Western countries because of the perception that the anti-oxidant properties of selenium could potentially reduce the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases. However, concern has been raised recently about possible adverse cardiometabolic effects of high selenium exposure, including an increased risk of diabetes and hyperlipidemia with high selenium intake. Hence, from a public health perspective, the relationship between selenium status and cardiometabolic health should be clarified in order to help guide consumers in their choices of nutritional {{supplements and}} enriched food products. Additional experimental evidence is needed to provide new insights into the role of selenium and of specific selenoproteins in human biology, especially to clarify the underlying mechanisms linking selenium to chronic disease endpoints. Further epidemiological studies and randomized clinical trials across populations with different selenium status should be conducted to determine the causal effect of selenium on cardiovascular disease and risk factors. Nevertheless, at the present time the widespread use of selenium supplements or other strategies that artificially increase selenium status above the level required for optimal selenoprotein activity is not justified and should not be encourage...|$|R
40|$|Whilst the {{profiling}} of the transcriptome and proteome even of single-cells becomes feasible, {{the analysis}} of the translatome, which refers to all messenger RNAs (mRNAs) engaged with ribosomes for protein synthesis, is still an elaborate procedure requiring millions of cells. Herein, we report the generation and use of “smart materials”, namely molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) to facilitate the isolation of ribosomes and translated mRNAs from merely 1, 000 cells. In particular, we show that a hydrogel-based ribosome imprinted polymer could recover ribosomes and associated mRNAs from human, simian and mice cellular extracts, but did not selectively <b>enrich</b> <b>yeast</b> ribosomes, thereby demonstrating selectivity. Furthermore, ribosome imprinted polymers enabled the sensitive measurement of an mRNA translational regulatory event, requiring 1, 000 -fold less cells than current methodologies. These results provide first evidence for the suitability of MIPs to selectively recover ribonucleoprotein complexes such as ribosomes, founding a novel means for sensitive detection of gene regulation...|$|R
