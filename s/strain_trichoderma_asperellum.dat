40|$|To defend {{themselves}} against pathogens, plants can activate {{a wide array of}} inducible defense mechanisms. Colonization of plant roots by selective non-pathogenic rhizobacteria or fungi systemically enhances the defensive capacity of the plant. In Arabidopsis thaliana this so-called induced systemic resistance (ISR) is regulated by a defense signaling pathway in which the phytohormones jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) play an important role [...] In Arabidopsis roots, colonization by the ISR-inducing strain Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS 417 r altered the transcriptional activity of 97 genes. One of the induced genes encodes the transcription factor (TF) MYB 72. Arabidopsis myb 72 mutants were not able to enhance their defensive capacity upon colonization by WCS 417 r or the fungal <b>strain</b> <b>Trichoderma</b> <b>asperellum</b> T 34, demonstrating that MYB 72 is required for ISR. However, transformants in which MYB 72 is constitutively expressed did not show an increased level of resistance. This indicates that besides MYB 72 at least one other component is required for ISR-signaling. Yeasts two-hybrid experiments demonstrated a physical interaction of MYB 72 with the EIN 3 -like protein EIL 3 in vitro. The latter has been implicated in the regulation of responses to ET and is as such a likely candidate involved in MYB 72 -dependent ISR signaling. In the shoot tissue no direct changes in gene expression could be observed upon colonization of the roots by WCS 417 r. However, after challenge inoculation, a large set of especially JA and/or ET-regulated genes showed a primed expression pattern. To investigate the molecular mechanism of this priming phenomenon, we monitored the expression of all methyl-JA-responsive genes in control and WCS 417 r-ISR-expressing plants. Promoter analysis of the genes that showed a WCS 417 r-primed response revealed a significant enrichment for the CACATG motif, which was previously demonstrated to serve as a docking site for the TF MYC 2. Mutants defective in the MYC 2 gene were not able to express WCS 417 r-ISR, indicating that MYC 2 {{plays an important role in}} priming for enhanced JA-responsive gene expressing during WCS 417 r-ISR. To gain further insight in priming for enhanced defense we compared WCS 417 r-ISR with resistance induced by the non-protein amino acid ?-aminobutyric acid (BABA-IR). Both BABA-IR and WCS 417 r-IR against Hyaloperonospora parasitica is associated with priming for enhanced formation of callose-containing cell-wall appositions at sites of pathogen entry. Mutants with a disruption in the IBS 2 or IBS 3 gene were specifically blocked in this response and consequently were affected in both BABA-IR and WCS 417 r-ISR, indicating that the pathways share signaling components involved in priming for enhanced callose deposition. Q-PCR-based profiling of all 2300 putative Arabidopsis TFs revealed a higher activity of a subset of TF-encoding genes in the systemic tissue of WCS 417 r- and BABA-primed plants. The set of WCS 417 r-induced TF-genes was enriched for those involved in the regulation of responses to JA, such as AP 2 /EREBPs and MYC 2. Amongst the TF genes of which the expression was induced by BABA, 21 encoded WRKYs, which have been demonstrated to regulate downstream processes in SA-signaling. Thus, induced resistance is accompanied by a systemic increase in the activity of a subset of TF genes, the composition of which depends on the nature of the priming agent. Collectively, the work described in this thesis advanced our understanding of rhizobacteria-mediated ISR and provided novel insights in the molecular mechanisms underlying priming for enhanced defense...|$|E

In this study, we found and identified a novel <b>strain</b> of <b>Trichoderma</b> <b>asperellum,</b> named GDFS 1009. The mycelium of T. asperellum GDFS 1009 exhibits a high growth rate, high sporulation capacity, and strong inhibitory effects against pathogens that cause cucumber fusarium wilt and corn stalk rot. T. asperellum GDFS 1009 secretes chitinase, glucanase, and protease, which can degrade the cell walls of fungi and contribute to mycoparasitism. The secreted xylanases are good candidates for inducing plant resistance and enhancing plant immunity against pathogens.

Recent indirect evidence has also pointed to a role of this system in bacterial-fungal interactions in soil. In the current study, we examine if the T 3 SS of the fungal-interactive Burkholderia terrae strain BS 001 can aid in the interaction of this bacterium with two soil fungi, i. e., Lyophyllum sp. <b>strain</b> Karsten and <b>Trichoderma</b> <b>asperellum</b> 302. We first analyzed the T 3 SS of strain BS 001 and then constructed a knockout mutant of the essential sctD gene. The selected sctD mutant strain did not show any differences to the wild-type strain with respect to its growth and nutrient utilization behavior, excluding polar effects of the mutation. Then, the migration ability of the sctD mutant strain along with the hyphae of Lyophyllum sp. strain Karsten growing through presterilized soil was tested, revealing hampered comigration as compared to the wild-type strain. The effect was also observed with T. asperellum 302.

Among 21 isolates, we identified 42. 86 % as <b>Trichoderma</b> <b>asperellum,</b> 33. 33 % as Trichoderma harzianum, 14. 29 % as Trichoderma tomentosum, 4. 76 % as Trichoderma koningiopsis, and 4. 76 % as <b>Trichoderma</b> erinaceum. <b>Trichoderma</b> <b>asperellum</b> showed the highest CWDE activity. However, no species secreted a specific group of CWDEs. <b>Trichoderma</b> <b>asperellum</b> 364 / 01, T. asperellum 483 / 02, and T. asperellum 356 / 02 exhibited high and medium specific activities for key enzymes in the mycoparasitic process, but a low capacity for antagonism. We observed no significant correlation between CWDE and antagonism, or between metabolic profile and antagonism. The diversity of Trichoderma species, and in particular of T. harzianum, was clearly reflected in their metabolic profiles. Our findings indicate that the selection of Trichoderma candidates for biological control should be based primarily on the environmental fitness of competitive isolates and the target pathogen.

To assess the involvement of the type 3 secretion system (T 3 SS), wild-type strain BS 001 and T 3 SS mutant strain BS 001 -Delta sctD were used in the experiments. First, the two fungi showed divergent behavior when confronted with B. terrae BS 001 on soil extract agar medium. Lyophyllum sp. strain Karsten revealed slow growth towards the bacterium, whereas T. asperellum 302 grew avidly over it. Both on soil extract and M 9 agar, B. terrae BS 001 and BS 001 -Delta sctD moved chemotactically towards the hyphae of both fungi, with a stronger response to Lyophyllum sp. strain Karsten than to T. asperellum 302. The presence of a progressively increasing glycerol level in the M 9 agar enhanced the level of movement. Different oxalic acid concentrations exerted varied effects, with a significantly raised chemotactic response at lower, and a subdued response at higher concentrations. Testing of the adherence of B. terrae BS 001 and BS 001 -Delta sctD to Lyophyllum sp. strain Karsten and to cell envelope-extracted ceramide monohexosides (CMHs) revealed that CMHs in both conidia and hyphae could bind strain BS 001 cells.

However, the weight of dry rice root plants was not significant among treatments. Rice plants inoculated with Trichoderma sp. SL 2 have the highest increase in root fresh weight. The capacity of Trichoderma spp. to produce growth hormones such as auxins and gibberelins were reported as the main factor {{that contributes to the}} ability of Trichoderma spp. to support root growth and increase water absorption from soil (Arora et al., [1992]; Contreras-Cornejo et al., [2009]; Martínez-Medina et al., [2011]). The present findings are also in agreement with previous research by Viterbo et al.

40|$|A {{new family}} of synthetic, membrane-active, ultrashort lipopeptides {{composed}} of only four amino acids linked to fatty acids was {{tested for the}} ability to induce systemic resistance and defense responses in plants. We found that two peptides wherein the third residue is a d-enantiomer (italic), C 16 -KKKK and C 16 -KLLK, can induce medium alkalinization of tobacco suspension-cultured cells and expression of defense-related genes in cucumber and Arabidopsis seedlings. Moreover, these compounds can prime systemic induction of antimicrobial compounds in cucumber leaves similarly to the plant-beneficial fungus <b>Trichoderma</b> <b>asperellum</b> T 203 and provide systemic protection against the phytopathogens Botrytis cinerea B 05, Pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrimans, and P. syringae pv. tomato DC 3000.

Comparative secretome analysis of <b>Trichoderma</b> <b>asperellum</b> S 4 F 8 and Trichoderma reesei Rut C 30 during solid-state fermentation on sugarcane bagasse. Biotechnology for biofuels, 6 : 172, doi: 10. 1186 / 1754 - 6834 - 6 - 172. The original publication is available at [URL] The lignocellulosic enzymes of Trichoderma species have received particular attention with regard to biomass conversion to biofuels, but the production cost of these enzymes remains a significant hurdle for their commercial application. In this study, we quantitatively compared the lignocellulolytic enzyme profile of a newly isolated <b>Trichoderma</b> <b>asperellum</b> S 4 F 8 strain with that of Trichoderma reesei Rut C 30, cultured on sugarcane bagasse (SCB) using solid-state fermentation (SSF). Results: Comparison of the lignocellulolytic enzyme profiles of S 4 F 8 and Rut C 30 showed that S 4 F 8 had significantly higher hemicellulase and β-glucosidase enzyme activities. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the two fungal secretomes enabled the detection of 815 proteins in total, with 418 and 397 proteins being specific for S 4 F 8 and Rut C 30, respectively, and 174 proteins being common to both strains. In-depth analysis of the associated biological functions and the representation of glycoside hydrolase family members within the two secretomes indicated that the S 4 F 8 secretome contained a higher diversity of main and side chain hemicellulases and β-glucosidases, and an increased abundance of some of these proteins compared with the Rut C 30 secretome. Conclusions: In SCB SSF, T. asperellum S 4 F 8 produced a more complex lignocellulolytic cocktail, with enhanced hemicellulose and cellobiose hydrolysis potential, compared with T. reesei Rut C 30. This bodes well {{for the development of a}} more cost-effective and efficient lignocellulolytic enzyme cocktail from T. asperellum for lignocellulosic feedstock hydrolysis.

Rotted yam tubers were collected across three agroecological zones in Nigeria to isolate six infecting fungal pathogens: Aspergillus niger, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Rhizoctonia solani, Penicillium oxalicum, Fusarium oxysporum and Sclerotium rolfsii. The BCAs were isolated by serial dilution and rot inhibition of treated tubers was evaluated using destructive sampling method in vivo after six months of storage. Bacillus subtilis was generally most effective, especially when applied 24 h before the inoculation of test pathogens across the four yam species, with percent inhibition that ranged between 47. 8 and 81. 2 %. However, the four BCAs showed good potential in the control of the fungal pathogens causing post-harvest yam rot. Peer Revie...|$|R

Generally, synthetic fungicides {{were applied to}} control this disease but its negative impact is becoming obvious recently. Research was conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of two <b>Trichoderma</b> <b>asperellum</b> isolates, ARBT- 1 and ART- 4, to suppress disease development. The two isolates were applied through seed treatment with spore concentrations of 104 mL- 1, 105 mL- 1, and 106 mL- 1. The results showed that disease incidence on seedling treated with different spore concentrations of ARBT- 1 was 39. 0 %, 23. 6 %, and 21. 8 %, respectively and those with ART- 4 was 30. 6 %, 25. 7 %, and 30. 8 %, respectively, whereas disease incidence reached 90. 3 % for control at 21 days after inoculation of the pathogen. Observations on cocoa leaf tissues showed that the two isolates were found in leaf tissue, indicating that T. asperellum is an endophyte.

The experiments were conducted in pot cultures and controlled conditions. Commercial formula TRIFENDER containing <b>Trichoderma</b> <b>asperellum</b> spores and isolated from garden soil <b>strain</b> T 12 <b>Trichoderma</b> viride were used. In one embodiment, the plants were treated with pathogenic strain of Fusarium sp. that commonly damages crops and against which the whole arsenal of chemicals is used. Preparations obtained from isolated and multiplied fungal cultures were used for the treatment of the above-ground (spraying) and under-ground (sprinkling) parts of tomatoes. Influence of the Trichoderma fungi was determined by comparing the presence of necrosis on leaves in various groups of cultivated tomatoes compared to control samples. The development of seedlings was checked by measuring the length of plants and the weight of fresh and dry plants. The results demonstrated the protective role of Trichoderma spp. fungi in relation to the Fusarium sp [...] Leaves of tomato treated with solutions of saprophytic fungi had a statistically significant lower amount of necrotic changes caused by the pathogen. More effective in this regard was uncommercial isolate of T. viride.

40|$|<b>Trichoderma</b> <b>asperellum,</b> a {{traditional}} bio-control species, was demonstrated {{to be an}} excellent candidate for lignocellulose degradation in this work. Comparing to the representatively industrial <b>strain</b> of <b>Trichoderma</b> reeseiQM 6 a, T. asperellum T- 1 showed more robust growth, stronger spore production, faster secretion of lignocellulose-decomposing enzymes and better pH tolerance. The reducing sugar released by strain T- 1 {{on the second day}} of fermentation was 87 % higher than that of strain QM 6 a, although the maximum reducing sugar yield and the cellulase production persistence of the strain T- 1 were lower. Our experiment found that the cellulase secretion was strongly inhibited by glucose, suggesting the existence of carbon source repression pathway in T. asperellum T- 1. The inhibiting effect was enhanced with an increase in glucose concentration and was closely related to mycelium growth. SDS-PAGE and secondary mass-spectrum identification confirmed that the expression of endo- 1, 4 -β-xylanase I in T. asperellum T- 1 was down-regulated when glucose was added. The factor Cre 1, which plays an important role in the down-regulation of the endo- 1, 4 -β-xylanase I gene, was investigated by bioinformatics methods. The protein structure of Cre 1, analyzed using multiple protein sequence alignment, indicates the existence of the Zn-fingers domain. Then, the binding sites of Cre 1 on the endo- 1, 4 -β-xylanase I gene promoter were further elucidated. This study is the first report about Cre 1 -mediated carbon repression in the bio-control strain T. asperellum T- 1.
