25|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{behavioral}} therapy became widely {{utilized by}} {{researchers in the}} United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa, who were inspired by the behaviorist learning theory of Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and Clark L. Hull. In Britain, Joseph Wolpe, who applied the findings of animal experiments to his method of <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> applied behavioral research {{to the treatment of}} neurotic disorders. Wolpe's therapeutic efforts were precursors to today's fear reduction techniques. British psychologist Hans Eysenck presented behavior therapy as a constructive alternative.|$|E
25|$|Meditation {{techniques}} {{have also been}} used by Western theories of counseling and psychotherapy. Relaxation training works toward achieving mental and muscle relaxation to reduce daily stresses. Jacobson is credited with developing the initial progressive relaxation procedure. These techniques are {{used in conjunction with}} other behavioral techniques. Originally used with <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> relaxation techniques are now used with other clinical problems. Meditation, hypnosis and biofeedback-induced relaxation {{are a few of the}} techniques used with relaxation training. One of the eight essential phases of EMDR (developed by Francine Shapiro), bringing adequate closure to the end of each session, also entails the use of relaxation techniques, including meditation. Multimodal therapy, a technically eclectic approach to behavioral therapy, also employs the use of meditation as a technique used in individual therapy.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) {{developed from}} the combination of cognitive therapy and rational emotive behavior therapy, both of which grew out of cognitive psychology and behaviorism. CBT {{is based on the}} theory that how we think (cognition), how we feel (emotion), and how we act (behavior) are related and interact together in complex ways. In this perspective, certain dysfunctional ways of interpreting and appraising the world (often through schemas or beliefs) can contribute to emotional distress or result in behavioral problems. The object of many cognitive behavioral therapies is to discover and identify the biased, dysfunctional ways of relating or reacting and through different methodologies help clients transcend these in ways that will lead to increased well-being. There are many techniques used, such as <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> socratic questioning, and keeping a cognition observation log. Modified approaches that fall into the category of CBT have also developed, including dialectic behavior therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> {{can provide}} lasting {{relief to the}} {{majority}} of patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] Disappearance of residual and subclinical agoraphobic avoidance, and not simply of panic attacks, should be the aim of exposure therapy. [...] Similarly, <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> may also be used. Many patients can deal with exposure easier if they are {{in the company of a}} friend on whom they can rely. Patients must remain in the situation until anxiety has abated, because if they leave the situation, the phobic response will not decrease and it may even rise.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of kleptomania, the {{cognitive}} behaviour techniques used in these cases consists of covert sensitization, imaginal desensitization, <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> aversion therapy, relaxation training, and [...] "alternative sources of satisfaction".|$|E
2500|$|Trauma processing: <b>Systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> {{response}} activation and counter-conditioning, titrated {{extinction of}} emotional response, deconstructing disparity (emotional vs. reality state), resolution of traumatic material (state in which triggers don't produce the harmful distress {{and able to}} express relief.) ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> {{aversive}} therapy, covert sensitization, imaginal desensitization, and stimulus control {{have been}} proven {{to be successful in}} the treatments to the problems of pathological gambling. Also [...] "cognitive techniques such as psychoeducation, cognitive-restructuring, and relapse prevention" [...] have proven to be effective in the treatments of such cases.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{mention of}} the {{psychiatric}} term social phobia (phobie des situations sociales), {{was made in the}} early 1900s. Psychologists used the term [...] "social neurosis" [...] to describe extremely shy patients in the 1930s. After extensive work by Joseph Wolpe on <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> research on phobias and their treatment grew. The idea that social phobia was a separate entity from other phobias came from the British psychiatrist Isaac Marks, in the 1960s. This was accepted by the American Psychiatric Association and was first officially included in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The definition of the phobia was revised in 1989 to allow comorbidity with avoidant personality disorder, and introduced generalized social phobia. Social phobia had been largely ignored prior to 1985.|$|E
50|$|Desensitization {{is widely}} {{known as one}} of the most {{effective}} therapy techniques. In recent decades, <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> has been used less and less as a treatment of choice for anxiety disorders. Since 1970 academic research on <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> has declined, and the current focus has been on other therapies. In addition, the number of clinicians using <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> has also declined since 1980. Those clinicians that continue to regularly use <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> were trained before 1986. It is believed that the decrease of <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> by practicing psychologist is due to the increase in other techniques such as flooding, implosive therapy, and participant modeling.|$|E
50|$|A {{method used}} in the {{treatment}} of a phobia is <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> a process in which the patients seeking help slowly become accustomed to their phobia, and ultimately overcome it. Traditional <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> involves a person being exposed to the object they are afraid of over time, so that the fear and discomfort do not become overwhelming. This controlled exposure to the anxiety provoking stimulus is key to the effectiveness of exposure therapy {{in the treatment of}} specific phobia's. One form of <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> involves, humor. It has been shown that humor is an excellent alternative to the traditional <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> when it does not efficiently rid someone of a phobia. Humor <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> involves a series of treatment activities that consist of activities that elicit humor with the feared object. Previously learned progressive muscle relaxation procedures can be used as the activities become more difficult in a person’s own hierarchy level. Progressive muscle relaxation helps patients relax their muscles before and during exposures to the phobic object.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> is what Wolpe is {{most famous}} for. [...] But it was Wolpe who coined and perfected it. <b>Systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> {{is when the}} client is exposed to the anxiety-producing {{stimulus}} at a low level, and once no anxiety is present a stronger version of the anxiety-producing stimulus is given. This continues until the individual client no longer feels any anxiety towards the stimulus. There are three main steps in using <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> following development of a proper case formulation [...] or what Wolpe originally called, [...] "behavior analysis." [...] The {{first step is to}} teach the client relaxation techniques.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} for serious cases is behavior therapy—specifically, <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization.</b>|$|E
50|$|Specific phobias are {{one class}} of mental {{disorder}} often treated via <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization.</b> When persons experience such phobias (for example fears of heights, dogs, snakes, closed spaces, etc.), {{they tend to}} avoid the feared stimuli; this avoidance, in turn, can temporarily reduce anxiety but is not necessarily an adaptive way of coping with it. In this regard, patients' avoidance behaviors can become reinforced - a concept defined by the tenets of operant conditioning. Thus, the goal of <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> is to overcome avoidance by gradually exposing patients to the phobic stimulus, until that stimulus can be tolerated. Wolpe found that <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> was successful 90% {{of the time when}} treating phobias.|$|E
50|$|<b>Systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> {{has been}} shown to {{successfully}} treat phobias about heights, driving, insects as well as any anxiety that a person may have. Anxiety can include social anxiety, anxiety about public speaking as well as test anxiety. It {{has been shown}} that the use of <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> is an effective technique that can be applied to a number of problems that a person may have.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} methods for the {{treatment}} of specific phobias are <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> and in vivo or exposure therapy.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} {{methods used to}} treat phobias. These methods include: <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> {{progressive}} relaxation, virtual reality, modeling, medications, and hypnotherapy.|$|E
50|$|Participant {{modeling}} {{has been}} proven to be effective for children and adolescents. Participant modeling consists of a therapist modeling how the patients should respond to their fears. This encourages the patients to practice this behavior and reinforces their efforts. Similar to <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> patients are gradually introduced to the phobic objects. The main difference between participant modeling and <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> involves observations and modeling. Participant modeling encompasses a therapist modeling positive behavior(s), observing the positive behavior(s), and gradual exposure to the phobic object.|$|E
50|$|Behavioral therapies such as <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> {{developed}} by Joseph Wolpe and cognitive behavior therapy {{developed by}} Aaron Beck {{rest on the}} theory that an initial sensitizing event (ISE) has created the phobia. The gradually increased exposure needed for <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> is difficult to produce in actual flight. Desensitization using virtual flight has been disappointing. Clients report that simulated flight using computer-generated images does not desensitize them to risk because throughout the virtual flight they were aware they were in an office. Research shows Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) to be no more effective than sitting on a parked airplane. As a practical substitute for <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> the amygdala can be taught to regard a stimulus as benign by linking it to an experience already regarded by the amygdala as benign. This alternative has been termed systematic inhibition of the amygdala.|$|E
50|$|However, in his book, Virtual Reality Therapy for Anxiety Disorders, Dr. Wiederhold {{questions}} {{the effectiveness of}} <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> as {{the intensity of the}} perceived threat is reliant on the patient's imagination and could therefore produce a false response in regards to the patient's level of anxiety. His research into recent technological developments has made it possible to integrate virtual reality into <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> therapy in order to accurately recreate the threatening situation. At the time of publication, there had been no studies done to determine its effectiveness.|$|E

50|$|<b>Systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> {{also known}} as {{graduated}} exposure therapy {{is a type of}} behavior therapy used in the field of psychology to help effectively overcome phobias and other anxiety disorders. More specifically, it is a form of counter conditioning, a type of Pavlovian therapy developed by South African psychiatrist, Joseph Wolpe. In the 1947, Wolpe discovered that the cats of Wits University could overcome their fears through gradual and systematic exposure. The process of <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> occurs in three steps. The first step of <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> is the identification of an anxiety inducing stimulus hierarchy. The second step is the learning of relaxation or coping techniques. When the individual has been taught these skills, he or she must use them in the third step to react towards and overcome situations in the established hierarchy of fears. The goal of this process is for the individual to learn how to cope with, and overcome the fear in each step of the hierarchy.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of kleptomania, the {{cognitive}} behaviour techniques used in these cases consists of covert sensitization, imaginal desensitization, <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> aversion therapy, relaxation training, and [...] "alternative sources of satisfaction".|$|E
50|$|Before {{engaging}} in <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> {{it is common}} to train the individual with arachnophobia in relaxation techniques, which will help keep the patient calm. <b>Systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> can be done in vivo (with live spiders) or by getting the individual to imagine situations involving spiders, then modelling interaction with spiders for the person affected and eventually interacting with real spiders. This technique can be effective in just one session. The discovery of the implication of N-methyl-D-aspartate in fear and fear extinction has led to the use of D-cycloserine—originally developed as an antibiotic—to augment the results of therapy.|$|E
50|$|Virtual reality {{therapy is}} a type of therapy that helps {{patients}} imagine scenes with the phobic object, like <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> therapy. Using virtual reality, virtual reality therapy generates scenes that may not have been possible in the physical world. There are several advantages that virtual reality therapy has over <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> therapy: patients have the ability to control the scenes produced, patients can endure more phobic scenes (i.e. {{they may not be able}} to experience/handle these harsh scenes in real life), it is more realistic than simply imagining a scene, it occurs in a private room, and is very efficient.|$|E
5000|$|Trauma processing: <b>Systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> {{response}} activation and counter-conditioning, titrated {{extinction of}} emotional response, deconstructing disparity (emotional vs. reality state), resolution of traumatic material (state in which triggers don't produce the harmful distress {{and able to}} express relief.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{first line}} of {{treatment}} is <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> - also known as exposure therapy - which was first described by South African psychiatrist Joseph Wolpe. In addition, beta blockers, serotonin reuptake inhibitors and sedatives {{are used in the}} treatment of phobias.|$|E
5000|$|The therapy Mr. Salter {{employed}} encouraged {{patients to}} express their emotions and used visual imagery to reduce anxiety. It also moved people past their fears by gradually getting them accustomed to being around the things they feared. or <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> ...|$|E
50|$|In {{exposure}} therapy, an exposure hierarchy {{is developed}} to help clients confront their feared objects and situations {{in a manner}} that is systematic and controlled for the purpose of <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization.</b> Exposure hierarchies are included in the treatment of a wide range of anxiety disorders.|$|E
50|$|Between 25 to 40 {{percent of}} {{students}} experience test anxiety. Children can suffer from {{low self-esteem and stress}} induced symptoms as a result of test anxiety. The principles of <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> can be used by children to help reduce their test anxiety. Children can practice the muscle relaxation techniques by tensing and relaxing different muscle groups. With older children and college students, an explanation of desensitization can help to increase the effectiveness of the process. After these students learn the relaxation techniques, they can create an anxiety inducing hierarchy. For test anxiety these items could include not understanding directions, finishing on time or marking the answers properly. Teachers, school counselors or school psychologists could instruct children on the methods of <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization.</b>|$|E
50|$|Barber et al. {{noted that}} similar factors {{appeared}} {{to mediate the}} response both to hypnotism and to cognitive behavioural therapy, in particular <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization.</b> Hence, research and clinical practice inspired by their interpretation has led to growing interest {{in the relationship between}} hypnotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy.|$|E
50|$|Behavioral therapies are {{types of}} non-medication based {{treatment}} which are mainly exposure-based techniques. These include {{techniques such as}} <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> emotive imagery, participant modelling and contingency management. Behavioral therapies carefully expose individuals by small increments to slowly reduce their anxiety over time and mainly focuses on their behavior.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> {{aversive}} therapy, covert sensitization, imaginal desensitization, and stimulus control {{have been}} proven {{to be successful in}} the treatments to the problems of pathological gambling. Also [...] "cognitive techniques such as psychoeducation, cognitive-restructuring, and relapse prevention" [...] have proven to be effective in the treatments of such cases.|$|E
50|$|Flooding is a psychotherapeutic {{method for}} {{overcoming}} phobias. This is a faster method of ridding fears {{when compared with}} <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization.</b> In order to demonstrate the irrationality of the fear, a psychologist would put {{a person in a}} situation where they would face their phobia at its worst. Under controlled conditions and using psychologically-proven relaxation techniques, the subject attempts to replace their fear with relaxation. The experience can often be traumatic for a person, but may be necessary if the phobia is causing them significant life disturbances. The advantage to flooding is that it is quick and usually effective. There is, however, a possibility that a fear may spontaneously recur. This can be made less likely with <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitization,</b> another form of a classical condition procedure for the elimination of phobias.|$|E
50|$|Relaxation {{training}} involves clients {{learning to}} lower arousal {{to reduce their}} stress by tensing and releasing certain muscle groups throughout their body. <b>Systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> is a treatment in which the client slowly substitutes a new learned response for a maladaptive response by moving up a hierarchy of situations involving fear. <b>Systematic</b> <b>desensitization</b> is {{based in part on}} counter conditioning. Counter conditioning is learning new ways to change one response for another {{and in the case of}} desensitization it is substituting that maladaptive behaviour for a more relaxing behaviour. Exposure and response prevention techniques is also known as flooding and response prevention. Flooding and response prevention is the general technique in which you expose an individual to anxiety-provoking stimuli while keeping them from having any avoidance responses or keeping them from freaking out.|$|E
