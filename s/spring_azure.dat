50|$|American holly azures {{differ from}} the co-occurring azure species by their smaller size, wing color, flight period, pupal diapause, and larval hosts. Northern azures have earlier flight and pupal periods, larger size, and more vivid adult and larval color. <b>Spring</b> <b>azures</b> can be {{distinguished}} by close examination of the wing scale structure in a captured individual but are otherwise nearly indistinguishable by sight. The spring flight of summer azure associates with black cherry and does not diapause before the summer flight, which begins {{after the end of}} the American holly azure flight. Appalachian azures and cherry gall azures have ranges west of the range of American holly azures.|$|R

50|$|The park {{contains}} {{thousands of}} {{species in the}} life domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. There may be over 200 fungus species in the park, including artist's fungus, black locust shelf fungus, hedge-hog fungus, hen-of-the-woods, pear-shaped puffball, and turkey-tail fungus. Its trees include ashleaf maples, American beeches, American elms, black haws, cottonwoods, eastern redbuds, eastern sycamores, princesstrees, spicebushes, trees-of-heaven, tuliptrees, and white oaks. Its spring ephemerals include spring-beauties and cutleaf toothworts. Other wildflowers in the park are asters, elephant's-foot, wingstem, and yellow jewelweed. Two native plant species that are evidently now extinct in the park are round-lobed hepatica and trailing arbutus. Both ground and climbing forms of poison-ivy are common in Glover Archbold Park. In about 2000, highly pestiferous Asian tiger mosquitoes {{first appeared in the}} park. In 2004, adult 17-year cicadas were common there. A rare harvester butterfly was seen in the park. Some of its other insects are black swallowtails, Chinese mantids, eastern carpenter bees, eastern-tailed blues, eastern tiger swallowtails, Andrena erigeniae bees, false honey ants, impatient bumblebees, imperial moths, monarchs, Peck's skippers, Pennsylvania soldier beetles, sachem skippers, silver-spotted skippers, spicebush swallowtails, <b>spring</b> <b>azures,</b> summer azures, western honey bees, and zebra swallowtails. The park has a significant invasion of nonnative plants, including Asiatic bittersweet, bamboo, common periwinkle, English ivy, garlic-mustard, gill-over-the-ground, Japanese honeysuckle, lesser celandine, wild-garlic, and wintercreeper. Once a 2-foot tall, nonnative, tropical papaya seedling grew in the stream bed. Because people have altered the park's landscape so much, native fish are no longer in the stream. Eastern box turtles, frogs, and toads are rare or extinct in the park, not to mention American black bears, American elk, bison, and timber wolves which once lived in the Washington, D.C. area. Its birds include American robins, barred owls, blue jays, Carolina wrens, catbirds, common crows, fish crows, northern cardinals, northern mockingbirds, and wood thrushes. Mammals in the park include common raccoons, coyotes, domestic cats, domestic dogs, gray foxes, humans, short-tailed shrews, Virginia opossums, white-footed mice, and white-tailed deer.|$|R

50|$|Celastrina serotina, {{the cherry}} gall azure, is a {{butterfly}} of the Lycaenidae family. It is found across North America {{as far north}} as the treeline. Its flight time is between mid-May and mid-June in eastern Ontario after the <b>spring</b> <b>azure</b> and before the summer azure.|$|E
50|$|The {{species has}} one flight {{per year in}} the spring, between the flight periods of the {{northern}} azure and the spring brood of summer azure but overlapping with <b>spring</b> <b>azure</b> and cherry gall azure. The flight is from late April to late May {{in the northern part of}} the range.|$|E
50|$|Butterflies {{and other}} {{beneficial}} insects visit the plant for nectar and pollen. In autumn brown seed capsules appear and are fed on by songbirds. Glossy green foliage turns yellow in the fall. Deer tend {{to leave this}} plant alone. Meadowsweet is a host plant for the larvae of the <b>spring</b> <b>azure</b> butterfly. The blooms make a good cut flower.|$|E
50|$|Diverse {{wildlife}} eat the berries, including songbirds, deer, bear, {{and other}} large and small mammals. It is of notable pollinator and nesting material value for native bee and bumble bee species. This blackberry species is a larval food source for the western tiger swallowtail butterfly (Papilio rutulus), the mourning cloak butterfly (Nymphalis antiopa), the gray hairstreak butterfly (Strymon melinus), and the <b>spring</b> <b>azure</b> butterfly (Celastrina ladon).|$|E
50|$|Commonly {{found in}} damp, {{recently}} disturbed soil, open ground, turf and wasteplaces. Europe as far east as the Caucasus, and North Africa. These conditions are prevalent in nursery or garden centre plants, and hairy bittercress seeds may be introduced with those plants.

Other authorities still consider C. ladon and related species C. neglecta and C. serotina, to be [...] "full" [...] species.|$|E
