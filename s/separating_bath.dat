5000|$|Life in {{the ancient}} Roman cities {{revolved}} around the Forum, the central business district, {{where most of the}} Romans would go for marketing, shopping, trading, banking, and for participating in festivities and ceremonies.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} quantum heat engines consisting of two subsystems interacting via a unitary transformation and coupled to two <b>separate</b> <b>baths</b> at different temperatures T_h > T_c. The purpose of the engine is to extract work due to the temperature difference. Its dynamics is not restricted to the near equilibrium regime. The engine structure is determined by maximizing the extracted work under various constraints. When this maximization is carried out at finite power, the engine dynamics is described by well-defined temperatures and satisfies the local version of the second law. In addition, its efficiency is bounded from below by the Curzon-Ahlborn value 1 -√(T_c/T_h) and from above by the Carnot value 1 -(T_c/T_h). The latter is reached|at finite power|for a macroscopic engine, while the former is achieved in the equilibrium limit T_h→ T_c. When the work is maximized at a zero power, even a small (few-level) engine extracts work right at the Carnot efficiency. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|Single {{molecule}} magnets are novel mesoscopic materials exhibiting both {{classical and}} quantum properties. Revealing the decoherence and entanglement mechanisms in these systems {{is crucial for}} the applications in quantum information technologies. In this thesis, quantum tunneling of magnetization is studied in single molecule magnet dimer [Mn 4] 2. Motivated by the recent experiments demanding the modification of the current theories, phonon mediated spin bath decoherence model is proposed. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, the magnetization of the [Mn 4] 2 dimer under external magnetic field is investigated. Alternative entangled spin states involved in quantum tunnelings are identified by means of the exact solution of the Schrödinger equation and the Landau-Zener-Stückelberg method. Later, a decoherence model is introduced in which the interaction between the single molecule magnet (central spin) and spin bath is mediated by phonons in a coherent state or thermal distribution. It is observed that the decoherence factor decays in a Gaussian fashion and it becomes independent of the phonon frequencies at short times for coherent states and low temperature thermal distribution. In the former case, if the phonon energies are much larger than spin-phonon coupling or bath spins are fully polarized, decoherence time becomes independent of the initial phonon state. For the thermal state case, phonons play more important role in decoherence with increasing temperature. Possible effects of the temperature on spin bath contribution to decoherence is discussed. Then, the effect of entangled environment on decoherence is analyzed. Entanglement within environment is shown to reduce the decoherence of central spin. Also, the entanglement dynamics of the central bipartite spin system is studied. Classification of the Bell states is examined for common spin <b>bath,</b> and <b>separate</b> spin <b>baths.</b> Last part of the thesis is the analysis of dephasing in entangled qutrits (three level quantum systems) under the classical noise, and quantum decoherence.
