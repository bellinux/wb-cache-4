40|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>irradiance</b> {{variations}} {{and related}} PV energy gains or losses {{are one of}} the last great unknowns in PV yield prediction. Energy gains or losses due to 'spectral effects' are reflected by the so-called spectral mismatch factor, which is calculated from prevailing <b>solar</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>irradiance</b> distributions, the reference spectral distribution and the actual spectral response of solar cells concerned. The main reason for the current lack of knowledge on potential energy gains or losses is the scarcity of <b>solar</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>irradiance</b> data.

A comparisons of mismatch factors for amorphous silicon cells calculated with our procedure shows that our approach is a promising one. However, future research is needed for testing solar cell types other than amorphous silicon, model optimization and a closer analysis of measurement uncertainties...|$|E

The NRLSSI and SATIRE-S models provide the most comprehensive reconstructions of total and <b>spectral</b> <b>solar</b> <b>irradiance</b> over the period of satellite observation currently available. There is persistent controversy between the various measurements and models in terms of the wavelength dependence of the variation over the solar cycle, with repercussions on our understanding of the influence of UV solar irradiance variability on the stratosphere.
