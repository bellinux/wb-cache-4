After five years of primary education, the Princess received her secondary education (to pre-university level) from private tutors.|$|E
25|$|Chives {{thrive in}} well-drained soil, rich in organic matter, with a pH of 6-7 and full sun. They {{can be grown}} from seed and mature in summer, or early the {{following}} spring. Typically, chives need to be germinated at a temperature of 15 to 20°C (60-70°F) and kept moist. They can also be planted under a cloche or germinated indoors in cooler climates, then planted out later. After at least four weeks, the young shoots <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be planted out. They are also easily propagated by division.|$|E
25|$|The words {{found in}} a book of his {{signifying}} that though the catholic religion did now serve, swear and obey, yet if occasion were offered they {{would be ready to}} help the execution, , were annexed to a text taken out of a general council of Lateran for the authority of the pope in his excommunication, and at the last council of Trent there was a consent of the catholic princes for a reformation of such realms and persons as had gone from the authority of the bishop of Rome, when it was concluded that if any catholic prince took in hand to invade any realm to reform the same to the authority of the see of Rome, that then the catholics in that realm <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> assist and help them. And this was the meaning of the execution as he saith, which he never revealed to any man before.|$|E

25|$|West of Lake Rudolf, the 25th East African Brigade (Brig. W. Owen) {{marched on}} Namaraputh with the {{objective}} of taking the town of Kalam (Map 1: Point 4). Opposition from Merille tribesman in the area was so fierce, that the Brigade was compelled to cease its advance and to go over to the defensive. Any advance west of the lake would first require wide area operations to subdue these irregular forces. By the time Moyale fell, allied forces had captured Mogadishu to the east and this success encouraged General Wavell to advise Cunningham that the South African division <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>readied</b> <b>to</b> deploy to Egypt at short notice. Cunningham thus replaced 2nd and 5th Brigades with the 21st East African Brigade and withdrew them back into Kenya.|$|R

500|$|As final {{preparations}} for the play are made, Tuptim steals a moment to meet with Lun Tha. He tells her he has an escape plan, and she <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> leave after the performance ("I Have Dreamed"). [...] Anna encounters them, and they confide in her ("Hello, Young Lovers", reprise). The play ("Small House of Uncle Thomas", narrated ballet) is presented in a Siamese ballet-inspired dance. Tuptim is the narrator, and she tells her audience of the evil King Simon of Legree and his pursuit of the runaway slave Eliza. Eliza is saved by Buddha, who miraculously freezes a river and conceals her in snow. Buddha then causes the river to melt, drowning King Simon and his hunting party. [...] The anti-slavery message is blunt.|$|E
500|$|... "First and {{foremost}} I {{thought it was}} a good record. It was poppy and catchy and perfect for the summer. I think my core audience is young teenage girls and gay guys. Both of those groups tend to like pure pop music and I think that's what 'Chico' was. It was very different from the slightly leftfield style of 'Look at Me'. [...] The other thing that 'Chico' had going for it was that the music was Latin-based, I had written the song back in 1998 but by the time the summer of 1999 came around Latin-influenced music was ruling the charts. Ricky Martin had recently had a number one and there were others on the way. So it was a strange example of synchronicity that I <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go with a Latin track which I had written almost a year before".|$|E
500|$|Skylon is {{a series}} of designs for a single-stage-to-orbit {{spaceplane}} by the British company Reaction Engines Limited (REL), using SABRE, a combined-cycle, air-breathing rocket propulsion system. [...] The vehicle design is for a hydrogen-fuelled aircraft that would take off from a purpose-built runway, and accelerate to Mach5.4 at [...] altitude (compared to typical airliners' [...] ) using the atmosphere's oxygen before switching the engines to use the internal liquid oxygen (LOX) supply to take it into orbit. It could carry [...] of cargo to an equatorial low Earth orbit (LEO); up to [...] to the International Space Station, almost 45% more than the capacity of the European Space Agency's Automated Transfer Vehicle; or [...] to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO), over 30% more than SpaceX F9 RTLS (.) The relatively light vehicle would then re-enter the atmosphere and land on a runway, being protected from the conditions of re-entry by a ceramic composite skin. [...] When on the ground, it would undergo inspection and necessary maintenance. If the design goal is achieved, it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> fly again within two days and be able to complete 200 orbital flights.|$|E

500|$|Starting in November 1943, the Army Air Forces Materiel Command at Wright Field, Ohio, began Silverplate, the codename {{modification}} of B-29s {{to carry the}} bombs. Test drops were carried out at Muroc Army Air Field, California, and the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, California. Groves met with the Chief of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), General Henry H. Arnold, in March 1944 to discuss the delivery of the finished bombs to their targets. The only Allied aircraft capable of carrying the [...] long Thin Man or the [...] wide Fat Man was the British Avro Lancaster, but using a British aircraft would have caused difficulties with maintenance. Groves hoped that the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress could be modified to carry Thin Man by joining its two bomb bays together. Arnold promised that no effort would be spared to modify B-29s to do the job, and designated Major General Oliver P. Echols as the USAAF liaison to the Manhattan Project. In turn, Echols named Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson as his alternate, and Wilson became Manhattan Project's main USAAF contact. President Roosevelt instructed Groves that if the atomic bombs were ready before the war with Germany ended, he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> drop them on Germany.|$|E

6000|$|... "Accidents {{will happen}} in the best {{regulated}} families," [...] said Walker, with vulgar, good-humoured obtuseness that filled Corey with indignation.

[...] They then leave Rivendell and arrive at Bree and find that the little town is in a great state of fear. [...] The innkeeper Butterbur informs the {{travellers}} that evil men had come up the Greenway and started trouble, even killing some of the inhabitants, while others like Bill Ferny had joined in with the vagabonds. [...] Butterbur is put at ease and finally understands when they tell him that things will soon improve because Strider is the new king and will come north to stabilize the region. [...] They leave Bree {{and come to the}} borders of the Shire where Gandalf leaves them to go and visit Bombadil.|$|E
2500|$|As the Allied {{operations}} in the Middle East were secondary to the Western Front campaign, reinforcements requested by General Sir Archibald Murray, commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), were denied. Further, on 11 January 1917, the War Cabinet informed Murray that large scale {{operations in}} Palestine were to be deferred until September, and he was informed by Field Marshal William Robertson, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff , that he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> send possibly two infantry divisions to France. One week later, Murray received a request for the first infantry division and dispatched the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. He was assured that none of his mounted units would be transferred from the EEF, and was told [...] "that there was no intention of curtailing such activities as he considered justified by his resources." [...] Murray repeated his estimate that five infantry divisions, {{in addition to the}} mounted units, were needed for offensive operations.|$|E

2500|$|Programa MIT-Portugal (see [...] ): is a {{partnership}} in graduate {{education and research}} in advanced systems engineering, bioengineering, energy and transportation systems, and also in management, involving the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (U.S.A.), Portuguese universities, other research institutions, and companies. Mariano Gago the Portuguese Minister of Science Technology and Higher Education said, in his perspective, about MIT-Portugal programme: [...] "The worst (higher education institutions) should learn and the best <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> face the challenges". The institutions in this programme include: the Instituto Superior de Ciências do Trabalho e da Empresa (only in management), Minho University, New University of Lisbon, Catholic University of Portugal (only in management), Technical University of Lisbon, University of Coimbra, and the University of Porto. The program includes companies like Volkswagen's AutoEuropa, Amorim, and Simoldes, among others. The project is financed by the Government of Portugal and participants were selected by the Portuguese Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education based on multicriteria MIT's evaluation of the Portuguese institutions.|$|E
2500|$|A {{week after}} the engagement, the {{proposed}} Anglo-Russo alliance experienced its first crisis. Queen Victoria asked the Tsar to bring Maria to Scotland, {{so that she could}} meet her future daughter-in-law. Alexander II refused. The Tsarina suggested that they all meet in Cologne, instead. The Queen called it [...] "simply impertinent" [...] that [...] "I ... who have been nearly twenty years longer on the throne than the Emperor of Russia ... and who am a Reigning Sovereign ... <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> run to the slightest call of the mighty Russians ... like any little Princess." [...] Victoria also made herself unpopular by refusing the Tsar’s offer to make the Prince of Wales colonel of a Russian regiment, and by demanding that an Anglican marriage service be held in St Petersburg alongside the Orthodox ceremony. But Maria Alexandrovna looked forward happily to her marriage: [...] "How happy I am to belong to him. I feel that my love for him is growing daily. I have a feeling of peace and inexpressible happiness and a boundless impatience to be altogether his own." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shevlin was {{survived by}} his widow and two children. Shevlin left a fortune {{estimated}} to be worth $3,500,000. [...] The estate was left in trust for his children, and his widow was left with an allowance of $60,000 per year. [...] He also left more than $1.5 million in life insurance, most of which went to the companies that he ran. [...] Only seven other men in the United States carried as much life insurance as Shevlin. [...] After his death, the $1.5 million life insurance purchased by the Shevlin companies was used by life insurance in a major advertising campaign promoting the use of keyman insurance. [...] The following text from a full-page advertisement in The Atlanta Constitution is an example:"The value of an officer or worker in any partnership or corporation is most realized at his death. [...] Then insurance {{in favor of the}} business <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> replace him. [...] Tom Shevlin's firm lost its most valuable asset in Tom Shevlin's death, but insurance of about a million dollars will replace his loss.
