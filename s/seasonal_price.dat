Key Words: amplitude, <b>seasonal</b> <b>pricing</b> plan, seasonality. Florida milk production varies throughout the year, with production being highest in the spring and lowest in the late summer. There are two primary reasons for this occurrence. First are biological factors that are affected by moderate temperatures in the spring and hot weather in the summer. Second is the farmer’s perception of the profitability of spring pro-duction. During the cooler months, more milk per cow is produced at lower input cost levels (Kaiser, Otenacu, and Smith). Additionally, the demand for milk varies seasonally due to school lunch programs and tourism. However, milk consumption tends to be less volatile than Andrew A.

40|$|Five {{concepts}} {{for conservation}} of municipal water supply are analyzed {{from an economic}} efficiency perspectice. They include: 1) <b>seasonal</b> <b>pricing</b> (for reduction of peak period water use), 2) dual water systems (separate high quality drinking water and untreated outdoor irrigation systems), 3) imported water transmission facility capacity optimization, 4) flow restricting devices, and 5) short-term rationing concepts. Optimization models, including generalized model generators, were developed for analysis {{of the first three}} concepts and demonstrated by applications to cities in Utah. The flow restricting device and short-term rationsing concept analyses applied approaches taken from the literature to example sites in Utah. The final chapter is a comparison of results and summary of conditions which favor each approach to conservation. Conclusions include: <b>Seasonal</b> <b>pricing</b> was demonstarted to reduce peak period water use but is not justified in Salt Lake City because the added cost of metering exceeds the additional benefits. Dual water systems are potentially an important concept for matching various qualities of water with appropriate uses and producing net economic benefits. Determination of capacity of an imported water facility is dominated more by the decision maker 2 ̆ 7 s attitude toward risk than by pricing policy. Flow restricting devices produce economic benefits only if the change in quality of service is ignored. Price elasticity is much lower during a drought than during normal conditions...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we reevaluate the {{evidence}} of seasonality in prices which we find to be substantially greater than previous research has indicated. That is, <b>seasonal</b> <b>price</b> movements have become more prominent in the relatively stable inflation environment that has prevailed since 1982. One main conclusion is drawn from this analysis: The amount of seasonality in prices differs greatly by item, {{making it difficult to}} generalize about <b>seasonal</b> <b>price</b> movements. A casual reading fails to reveal an easily identifiable origin of the seasonal variation of prices. That is, seasonality in consumer prices is predominantly idiosyncratic in nature, a result that contrasts with studies demonstrating a common seasonal cycle in real economic variables. This finding has an important practical implication: Given the selective, disaggregated approach taken by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to adjust data seasonally, the existence of idiosyncratic seasonality increases the likelihood of allowing noise in the aggregate CPI at a seasonal frequency. This argues in favor of seasonally adjusting the index after aggregation. ...|$|E

40|$|On the {{determination}} of net farm returns on rice production, <b>seasonal</b> <b>price</b> {{seems to be an}} important factor in Myanmar. The achievement of high income is partially offset by low <b>seasonal</b> <b>price.</b> Under the same level of yield received from rice production, the farmers who can access the higher price obtained more profit. In the present rice production system, the total productivity is mainly being impacted by increased cropping intensity and the yield per unit area. Although the growth rate of yield seems to be impressive in the moment, there has been much potential to obtain much more yield by using essential agricultural inputs. The effect of inputs used doesn’t show any evidence on total productivity of rice. Especially, the utilization of chemical fertilizer and the effect of loans distribution {{are not likely to be}} efficient to obtain higher productivity. Since the analyses suggest that both the price elasticity of demand and the income elasticity of demand are inelastic, it is reasonable to assume that rice is normal good in Myanmar and thus demand is not very sensitive to income changes.
