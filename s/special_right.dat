Wetheral Priory was a small Benedictine institution, founded by Ranulf le Meschin following the Norman invasion of Cumbria {{at the beginning of the}} 12th century. The motherhouse of the priory was St Mary's Abbey in York. The priory was known for a <b>special</b> <b>right</b> of sanctuary for criminals that had been granted to it by Henry I, allowing the priory to shelter felons who could reach the church and ring the bell there.|$|E
5|$|Prem and Poonam {{go through}} the most magical and romantic period of their lives. Coming from {{different}} sensibilities, both want their relationship to be very right for each other. Both {{realize the importance of}} the engagement rings that they have given to each other and the <b>special</b> <b>right</b> that they have got on each other in return. They begin to fall in love and become attached to each other, thanks to the gentle prodding of their respective siblings. After several days, Harishchandra and his family return home to attend their business, which leaves Poonam and Prem the choice to communicate via telephone and letter. Prem joins the family business and takes on a heavy presentation in Japan. Upon returning, the family brings Poonam as a surprise and they celebrate their engagement.|$|E

30|$|Like {{disability}} rights advocates, {{gay rights}} advocates have long argued that their rights {{should not be}} construed as <b>special</b> <b>rights.</b> The GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation 2016) Media Reference Guide identifies <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> as offensive and equal rights as preferred. As the Media Reference Guide explains, “Anti-gay extremists frequently characterize {{equal protection of the}} law for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people as <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> to incite opposition” to basic, human, and civil rights. The negative implication of misconstruing human <b>rights</b> as <b>special</b> <b>rights</b> is unappreciated by many minority groups (Goldberg-Hiller & Milner, 2003; Marcosson, 2012; Rubin, 1998).|$|R

25|$|In some respects, Thabit is {{critical}} of the ideas of Plato and Aristotle, particularly regarding motion.

25|$|Following the {{continental}} European tradition of author's rights, the law recognized moral and economic (patrimonial) rights. A <b>special</b> <b>right</b> {{of the author}} to remuneration was no longer mentioned: it was not needed anymore since the author's rights were exclusive and authors could freely negotiate contracts. On contracts, the law provided that only the rights explicitly mentioned in a contract were transferred, and that the new rights holder could sub-license these rights to a third party only if the contract explicitly provided for this. Furthermore, contracts {{were not allowed to}} cover the future works of an author.|$|E

25|$|Because the congrua {{are exactly}} the numbers that are four times the area of a Pythagorean triangle, and {{multiplication}} by four does not change whether a number is square, {{the existence of a}} square congruum is equivalent to the existence of a Pythagorean triangle with a square area. It is this variant of the problem that Fermat's proof concerns: he shows {{that there is no such}} triangle. In considering this problem, Fermat was inspired not by Fibonacci but by an edition of Diophantus published by Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac. This book described various <b>special</b> <b>right</b> triangles whose areas had forms related to squares, but did not consider the case of areas that were themselves square.|$|E
25|$|In {{the canon}} {{law of the}} Roman Catholic Church, a {{dispensation}} is the exemption from the immediate obligation of law in certain cases. Its object is to modify the hardship often arising from the rigorous application of general laws to particular cases, and its essence is to preserve the law by suspending its operation in such cases. Since laws aimed at {{the good of the}} entire community may not be suitable for certain cases or persons, the legislator has the right (sometimes even the duty) to dispense from the law. Dispensation is not a permanent power or a <b>special</b> <b>right</b> as in privilege. If the reason for the dispensation ceases entirely, then the dispensation also ceases entirely. If the immediate basis for the right is withdrawn, then the right ceases.|$|E

More specifically to the case, they argued that fraud was not arbitrable under the language of the arbitration clause, that their agreement with Shearson was an unenforceable adhesion contract and that McNulty's action in state court voided the arbitration clause.|$|E

2500|$|A right {{triangle}} (or right-angled triangle, formerly called a rectangled triangle) {{has one of}} its interior angles measuring 90° (a right angle). The side opposite to the right angle is the hypotenuse, the longest side of the triangle. The other two sides are called the legs or catheti (singular: [...] ) of the triangle. Right triangles obey the Pythagorean theorem: {{the sum of the}} squares of the lengths of the two legs is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse: , where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse. <b>Special</b> <b>right</b> triangles are {{right triangle}}s with additional properties that make calculations involving them easier.

2500|$|Justice Fisher then {{reviewed}} {{the provisions of}} the Parish Schools Act.

[...] Like Chief Justice Ritchie, he referred to the provision barring books of controversial theology from the school libraries. [...] Justice Fisher interpreted that provision as barring books of denominational teaching. [...] He concluded that the schools were common to everyone, irrespective of religious opinions. [...] No class or creed had any <b>special</b> <b>right</b> in the governance of the schools generally, or in any particular parish school. [...] As well, the Act provided that no student was to read any religious book or participate in any religious act of devotion, unless the student's parents wished it. [...] Justice Fisher held that this provision was a positive enactment against denominational teaching by the school. [...] He also concluded that the provision for Bible readings in the schools did not establish that the schools were denominational, since in his view the Bible was not a denominational book.|$|E

2500|$|The {{priority}} {{system is}} reinforced by a line of case law, whose principle {{is to ensure that}} creditors cannot contract out of the statutory regime. [...] This is sometimes referred to as the [...] "anti-deprivation rule". The general principle, according to the Mellish LJ in Re Jeavons, ex parte Mackay is that [...] "a person cannot make it a part of his contract that, in the event of bankruptcy, he is then to get some additional advantage which prevents the property being distributed under the bankruptcy laws." [...] So in that case, Jeavons made a contract to give Brown & Co an armour plates patent, and in return Jeavons would get royalties. Jeavons also got a loan from Brown & Co. They agreed half the royalties would pay off the loan, but if Jeavons went insolvent, Brown & Co would not have to pay any royalties. The Court of Appeal held half the royalties would still need to be paid, because this was a <b>special</b> <b>right</b> for Brown & Co that only arose upon insolvency. In a case where a creditor is owed money by an insolvent company, but also the creditor itself owes a sum to the company, Forster v Wilson held that the creditor may set-off the debt, and only needs to pay the difference. The creditor does not have to pay all its debts to the company, and then wait with other unsecured creditors for an unlikely repayment. However, this depends on the sums for set-off actually being in the creditors' possession. In British Eagle International Air Lines Ltd v Compaigne Nationale Air France, a group of airlines, through the International Air Transport Association had a netting system to deal with all the expenses they incurred to one another efficiently. All paid into a common fund, and then {{at the end of each}} month, the sums were settled at once. British Eagle went insolvent and was a debtor overall to the scheme, but Air France owed it money. Air France claimed it should not have to pay British Eagle, was bound to pay into the netting scheme, and have the sums cleared there. The House of Lords said this would have the effect of evading the insolvency regime. It did not matter that the dominant purpose of the IATA scheme was for good business reasons. It was nevertheless void. Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc observed that the general principle consists of two subrules [...] the anti-deprivation rule (formerly known as [...] "fraud upon the bankruptcy law") and the pari passu rule, which are addressed to different mischiefs [...] and held that, in borderline cases, a commercially sensible transaction entered into in good faith should not be held to infringe the first rule. All these anti-avoidance rules are, however, subject to the very large exception that creditors remain able to jump up the priority queue, through the creation of a security interest.|$|E
