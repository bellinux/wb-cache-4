40|$|A {{system has}} been {{designed}} and a neutron generator installed to perform fast neutron radiography. With this system, objects {{as small as a}} coin and as large as a 19 liter container have been radiographed. The neutron source is an MF Physics A- 711 neutron generator which produces 3 x 10 [sup 10] neutrons/second with an average energy of 14. 5 MeV. The radiography system uses x-ray scintillation screens and film in commercially available light-tight cassettes. The cassettes have been modified to include a thin sheet of plastic to produce protons from the neutron beam through elastic scattering from hydrogen and other low Z materials in the plastic. For film densities from 1. 8 to 3. 0, exposures range from 1. 9 x 10 [sup 7] n/cm[sup 2] to 3. 8 x 10 [sup 8] n/cm[sup 2] {{depending on the type of}} screen and film. The optimum <b>source-to-film</b> <b>distance</b> was found to be 150 cm. At this distance, the geometric unsharpness was determined to be approximately 2. 2 - 2. 3 mm and the smallest hole that could be resolved in a 1. 25 cm thick sample had a diameter of 0. 079 cm...|$|E
