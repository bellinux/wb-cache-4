40|$|Abstract: In this study, dynamic {{pressures}} due {{to impact}} of a ski jump out of a flip bucket downstream of a chute spillway model have been studied. Experiments were performed for five discharge (0. 11, 0. 18, 0. 25, 0. 32, 3 0. 39 m /s per unit width) and four jet impact angles (0 °, 30 °, 60 °, 90 °). Fluctuation of dynamic pressure was measured using a 250 mbar pressure transducer. Discharge (q), horizontal and vertical distance from the peak to jet impact location (L, H-h) and angle impact in downstream (è) were considered as the main parameters affecting the dynamic pressure. Results showed that pressure coefficient is highly sensitive to horizontal and vertical distances to impact location {{as well as to}} the impact angle. Using dimensionless parameters, a power function was correlated for calculation of the dynamic pressure for variable impact angle. Key words: Dynamic pressure <b>Sky</b> jump <b>Jet</b> impac...|$|R

Within the limited dynamic range of these observations, it is one-sided (jet:counterjet ratio greater than 12 : 1).

40|$|Radio galaxies {{have emerged}} as a new gamma-ray {{emitting}} source class on the extragalactic <b>sky.</b> With their <b>jets</b> misaligned, i. e. not directly pointing towards us, they offer a unique tool to probe some of the fundamental (and otherwise hidden) non-thermal processes in AGN. This contribution briefly summarizes the observed characteristics of the four radio galaxies detected so far at very high energies (VHE). Given its prominence, particular attention {{is given to the}} origin of the variable VHE emission in M 87. We discuss some of the theoretical progress achieved for this source within recent years highlighting, amongst others, the relevance of magnetospheric particle acceleration and emission models.

40|$|We {{have made}} a ∼ 30 ksec Chandra {{observation}} of the redshift z= 0. 63 GPS quasar B 2 0738 + 313. We detected X-ray emission from the core and have discovered a 200 kpc (projected on the <b>sky)</b> X-ray <b>jet.</b> The X-ray jet is narrow and curves, following the extended radio structure {{to the south of}} the quasar, and ending with a hot spot at the southernmost part of the radio lobe. The jet has a knot at ∼ 13 arcsec away from the core. The knot emission is consistent with the X-rays being created by the inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons and requires jet bulk Lorentz factors of a few (Γbulk ∼ 5 − 7). We discuss the emission mechanisms that may be responsible for the jet emission. We present new VLA data of the core and jet, and discuss the relation between the extended radio and X-ray emission. Extended emission observed in several GPS sources has been interpreted as a signature of the source past activity, while the GPS source is young and newly expanded. We argue that B 2 0738 + 313 may be an example of a new class of radio sources similar to the FRII radio galaxies in their high jet bulk velocities, but with the powerful GPS-like nucleus. B 2 0738 + 313 also has two damped Lyman-α systems along the line of sight, at zabs = 0. 0912 and 0. 2212.

40|$|Small {{maritime}} targets, e. g., periscope tubes, <b>jet</b> <b>skies,</b> swimmers {{and small}} boats, are potential threats for naval ships under many conditions, but {{are difficult to}} detect with current radar systems due to their limited radar cross section {{and the presence of}} sea clutter. On the other hand, applications of lidar systems have shown that the reflections from small targets are significantly stronger than reflections from the sea surface. As a result, dedicated lidar systems are potential tools for the detection of small maritime targets. A geometric approach is used to compare the diffuse reflection properties of cylinders and spheres with flat surfaces, which is used to estimate the maximum detectable range of such objects for a given lidar system. Experimental results using lasers operating at 1. 06 μm and 1. 57 μm confirm this theory and are discussed. Small buoys near Scheveningen harbor could be detected under adverse weather over more than 9 km. Extrapolation of these results indicates that small targets can be detected out to ranges of approximately 20 km...|$|R
40|$|Active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets seen {{at small}} viewing angles {{are the most}} {{luminous}} and abundant objects in the γ-ray <b>sky.</b> AGN with <b>jets</b> misaligned along the line-of-sight appear fainter in the sky, but are more numerous than the brighter blazars. We calculate the diffuse γ-ray emission due to the population of misaligned AGN (MAGN) unresolved by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi). A correlation between the γ-ray luminosity and the radio-core luminosity is established and demonstrated to be physical by statistical tests, as well as compatible with upper limits based on Fermi-LAT data for a large sample of radio-loud MAGN. We constrain the derived γ-ray luminosity function {{by means of the}} source count distribution of the radio galaxies (RGs) detected by the Fermi-LAT. We finally calculate the diffuse γ-ray flux due to the whole MAGN population. Our results demonstrate that the MAGN can contribute from 10 % up to nearly the entire measured Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background (IGRB). We evaluate a theoretical uncertainty on the flux of almost an order of magnitude. 1...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{two-dimensional}} hydrodynamics code (PROMETHEUS), we study the continued evolution of rotating massive helium stars whose iron core collapse {{does not produce}} a successful outgoing shock, but instead forms a black hole. We study {{the formation of a}} disk, the associated flow patterns, and the accretion rate for disk viscosity parameter, alpha ~ 0. 001 and 0. 1. For the standard 14 solar mass model the average accretion rate for 15 s is 0. 07 solar masses per second and the total energy deposited along the rotational axes by neutrino annihilation is (1 - 14) x 10 ** 51 erg, depending upon the evolution of the Kerr parameter and uncertain neutrino efficiencies. Simulated deposition of this energy in the polar regions results in strong relativistic outflow - jets beamed to about 1. 5 % of the <b>sky.</b> The <b>jets</b> remain highly focused, and are capable of penetrating the star in 5 - 10 s. After the jet breaks through the surface of the star, highly relativistic flow can commence. Because of the sensitivity of the mass ejection and jets to accretion rate, angular momentum, and disk viscosity, and the variation of observational consequences with viewing angle, a large range of outcomes is possible ranging from bright GRBs like GRB 971214 to faint GRB-supernovae like SN 1998 bw. X-ray precursors are also possible as the jet first breaks out of the star. While {{only a small fraction of}} supernovae make GRBs, we predict that all GRBs longer than a few seconds will make supernovae similar to SN 1998 bw. However, hard, energetic GRBs shorter than a few seconds will be difficult to make in this model.

40|$|Naval {{operations}} in the littoral {{have to deal with}} the threat of small sea-surface targets. These targets have a low radar cross-section and low velocity, which makes them hard to detect by radar in the presence of sea clutter. Typical threats include periscopes, <b>jet</b> <b>skies,</b> FIAC’s, and speedboats. Search lidars on board naval vessels can provide detection capability for small sea-surface targets. Lidar measurements at the coast have shown a very good signal-to-clutter ratio with respect to buoys located up to 10 km from the shore were the lidar system was situated. The lidar clutter is much smaller than the radar clutter due to the smoothness of the sea surface for optical wavelengths, thus almost all laser light is scattered away from the receiver. These results show that due to the low clutter a search lidar is feasible that can detect small sea-surface targets. The concept of a search lidar is presented and its performance is derived from system models. By using a high rep-rate laser and a variable beam divergence the search time can be limited. The design of a search lidar based on a commercially available high power and high rep-rate laser is shown...|$|R
40|$|The quasi-stellar object (QSO) /merger Mrk 231 {{is arguably}} the nearest and best {{laboratory}} for studying QSO feedback. It hosts several outflows, including broad-line winds, radio jets, and a poorly-understood kpc scale outflow. In this Letter, we present integral field spectroscopy from the Gemini telescope that represents the first unambiguous detection of a wide-angle, kpc scale outflow from a powerful QSO. Using neutral gas absorption, we show that the nuclear region hosts an outflow with blueshifted velocities reaching 1100 km s− 1, extending 2 − 3 kpc from the nucleus in all directions in {{the plane of the}} <b>sky.</b> A radio <b>jet</b> impacts the outflow north of the nucleus, accelerating it to even higher velocities (up to 1400 km s− 1). Finally, 3. 5 kpc south of the nucleus, star formation is simultaneously powering an outflow that reaches more modest velocities of only 570 km s− 1. Blueshifted ionized gas is also detected around the nucleus at lower velocities and smaller scales.

40|$|We present new X-ray {{observations}} of the nucleus, jet and extended emission of the nearby radio galaxy NGC 6251 using the Chandra/ACIS-S camera, together with a reanalysis of archival Chandra/ACIS-I and XMM-Newton/EPIC data. We find that the nuclear X-ray spectrum is well-fitted with an absorbed power-law, {{and that there is}} tentative, but not highly significant, evidence for Fe Kα emission. We argue that the observed nuclear X-ray emission is likely to originate in a relativistic jet, based on the double-peaked nature, and our synchrotron self-Compton modelling, of the radio-to-X-ray spectral energy distribution. However, we cannot rule out a contribution from an accretion flow. We resolve X-ray jet emission in three distinct regions, and argue in favour of a synchrotron origin for all three; inverse-Compton emission models are possible but require extreme parameters. We detect thermal emission on both galaxy and group scales, and demonstrate that hot gas can confine the jet, particularly if relativistic beaming is important. We show evidence that the radio lobe has evacuated a cavity in the X-ray-emitting gas, and suggest that the lobe is close to the plane of the <b>sky,</b> with the <b>jet</b> entering the lobe close to the surface nearest to the observer.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} high-energy, astrophysical phenomena are relativistic jets emitted from highly localized <b>sky</b> location. Such <b>jets</b> are common in Nature, observed to high redshift and in a range of wavelengths. Their precise generation mechanism remains a bit of a mystery, but they are generically believed to be powered by black holes. We here summarize the recent simulations of Palenzuela, Lehner and Liebling that shed light on the jet generation mechanism. These authors studied the merger of two non-spinning black holes {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field, perpendicular to the orbital plane and anchored by a circumbinary accretion disk, in the "force-free" approximation. They found that each black hole essentially acts as a "straw" that stirs the magnetic field lines around the center of mass as the black holes inspiral. The twisting of the magnetic field lines then generates jets around each black hole, even though these are not spinning. Their simulations show the formation of such a dual jet geometry and how it transitions to a single jet one, as the black holes merge due to gravitational wave emission. Comment: 2 pages, no figures.
