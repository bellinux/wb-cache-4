5|$|The {{presence}} of a strictly freshwater species on the <b>Seychelles</b> is hard to explain, biogeographically. Several possible explanations have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Before Alibera {{affected}} Madagascar, {{it produced}} winds of tropical cyclone {{force in the}} <b>Seychelles.</b> On Tromelin Island, Alibera produced sustained winds of 83km/h (52mph) with gusts to 124km/h (77mph).|$|E
5|$|In 1902, {{prior to}} the {{development}} of plate tectonics, Arnold Edward Ortmann proposed that land bridges formerly connected the <b>Seychelles</b> to other land masses.|$|E
5|$|The MFR named storms from a {{sequential}} list {{provided by}} the nation of <b>Seychelles,</b> beginning with Antoinette. In addition to the named storms in the year, the list included Maryse, Nelda, Ocline, Phyllis, Rolina, Sheryl, Thelma, Venyda, Wiltina, and Yolette.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Seychelles</b> Football Federation {{was founded}} in 1979, and became a FIFA {{affiliate}} in 1986. Women's football is represented in the federation by specific mandate and currently they employee one full-time employee {{to look after the}} women's game.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war in 1914, Bruce's prospecting ventures were on hold. He offered his services to the Admiralty, but failed to obtain an appointment. In 1915 he accepted a post as director and manager of a whaling company based in the <b>Seychelles,</b> and spent four months there, but the venture failed. On his return to Britain he finally secured a minor post at the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|FES is {{produced}} at Diageo owned breweries in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, <b>Seychelles,</b> Malaysia and Jamaica. In addition, it {{is produced}} under licence in 39 other countries. Diageo has brewing arrangements with the Castel Group to license brew and distribute Guinness in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali and Guinea.|$|E
5|$|In late April 1800, Confiance cruised off Sunda Strait, {{where she}} {{captured}} an American ship; she {{then left the}} strait to avoid the frigate , which was known to cruise in these waters, and sailed to the <b>Seychelles.</b> There, he escaped a British ship {{of the line and}} a frigate, and sailed on to cruise the Bay of Bengal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} in 1795, Surcouf took {{command of the}} 180-ton, {{privateer}} schooner Modeste, renamed Émilie, with a 32-man crew and four 6-pounder guns, armed by Malroux and Levaillant. Governor Malartic refused to provide a lettre de marque and ordered Émilie {{to go to the}} <b>Seychelles</b> to purchase tortoises as food for Isle de France.|$|E
5|$|Pigeons and doves are {{distributed}} everywhere on Earth, {{except for the}} driest areas of the Sahara Desert, Antarctica and its surrounding islands, and the high Arctic. They have colonised most of the world's oceanic islands, reaching eastern Polynesia and the Chatham Islands in the Pacific, Mauritius, the <b>Seychelles</b> and Réunion in the Indian Ocean, and the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Seychellum alluaudi is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} crab endemic to the <b>Seychelles,</b> and the only true freshwater crab in that country. It lives in rainforest streams on the archipelago's granitic high islands. Although it may be abundant, {{little is known about}} its biology. If its habitat were to decline in quality, S.alluaudi might become endangered, but it is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|Seychellum alluaudi is {{endemic to}} the {{granitic}} high {{islands in the}} inner group of the <b>Seychelles,</b> in the western Indian Ocean. It is found on the four largest granitic islands – Mahé, La Digue, Silhouette and Praslin – and lives in mountain streams that flow through rainforest.|$|E
5|$|The 2002–03 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} one of the longest lasting and the second-most active season in the South-West Indian Ocean. Storms during the season {{impacted}} the Mascarene Islands, <b>Seychelles,</b> Madagascar, and countries in southeastern Africa. The season began early when an unnamed tropical storm struck <b>Seychelles</b> in September, becoming the most damaging storm there in 50years. The next system, Atang, was the first named storm of the season, but was only a tropical depression; it was named due to the threat to an outer island of Mauritius. Atang later struck Tanzania in a climatologically unusual area in November, resulting in unconfirmed deaths of fishermen. The first named storm to reach tropical storm intensity was Boura, which brushed the Mascarene Islands with gusty winds and rainfall. In December, Cyclone Crystal threatened to strike Mauritius but instead veered eastward, and later, Tropical Storm Delfina lasted from late December through early January 2003. Delfina damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Mozambique and Malawi, killing 54people.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene {{martin has}} a heavy flight with slow wingbeats {{interspersed}} with glides, and may repeatedly {{return to a}} favourite perch. This martin is often seen perched on wires, and sometimes rests on sandy beaches. The martin roosts in small flocks in bushes, on buildings or on cliffs. Sometimes it is joined at the roost by other birds, such as blue-cheeked bee-eaters in the <b>Seychelles.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} may also show {{versatility}} in its diet. On islands with seabird colonies, it will prey on {{the eggs and}} chicks of terns and other seabirds. During migration {{it has also been}} reported to eat exhausted migrating landbirds. Birds of the <b>Seychelles</b> race also indulge in some kleptoparasitism, chasing the chicks of sooty terns and forcing them to disgorge food.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} P.b.borbonica is resident on Mauritius and Réunion, {{although there}} are local seasonal movements on these island, but the Madagascan subspecies is migratory. The Imerina Plateau is deserted from April to September, the martins moving to lower ground or to the African mainland. It is normally uncommon and local in coastal Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi and Pemba Island, and very rare in Kenya and mainland Tanzania, although large numbers sometimes winter in Mozambique or Malawi. It has also been recorded from Comoros and other Indian Ocean locations including at least four islands in the <b>Seychelles.</b> As of 2012, a total of eight birds had been sighted in the <b>Seychelles,</b> occurring in both the spring and autumn migration periods. Some of these records {{may be due to}} vagrant birds carried by cyclones. There are unsubstantiated claims of occurrences in the Transvaal.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{designation}} as {{a tropical}} disturbance, the predecessor to Cyclone Bejisa dropped heavy rainfall across the <b>Seychelles.</b> A weather station on Mahé observed 164mm (6.46in) of rain over a 24-hour period beginning on December27. The Farquhar Group were particularly affected, as the storm's incipient central region of convection remained {{over the area}} {{for an extended period}} of time.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} in the South Indian convergence zone near <b>Seychelles</b> persisted on October24 with {{an area of}} convection. It gradually organized while passing near Agaléga. On October27, it developed into a tropical depression, and after Dvorak classifications of 2.5, the system was named Arilisy. It became disorganized on October29, never having intensified beyond winds of 50km/h (30mph). After moving to the southwest for much of its duration, Arilisy dissipated on October30.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance is named {{when it reaches}} moderate tropical storm strength. If a {{tropical disturbance}} reaches moderate tropical storm status west of 55°E, then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm. If a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status between 55°E and 90°E, then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Mauritius assigns the appropriate name to the storm. A new annual list is used every year, and this list {{was provided by the}} country of <b>Seychelles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} nocturnal migrants. Most corn crakes migrate through Egypt, with smaller numbers {{crossing}} {{at the western}} end of the Mediterranean. It has been recorded in most countries between its breeding and wintering ranges, including much of west Africa, and those parts of southern Asia that lie between the east of the breeding range and Africa. Further afield, it has been recorded as a vagrant to Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Australia, the <b>Seychelles,</b> Bermuda, Canada, the United States, Greenland, and the North Atlantic islands.|$|E
5|$|British {{sovereignty}} {{of several of}} the overseas territories is disputed by their geographical neighbours: Gibraltar is claimed by Spain, the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are claimed by Argentina, and the British Indian Ocean Territory is claimed by Mauritius and <b>Seychelles.</b> The British Antarctic Territory is subject to overlapping claims by Argentina and Chile, while many countries do not recognise any territorial claims in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean has {{the largest}} and densest {{population}} of coconut crabs in the world, although it is outnumbered there by more than 50 times by the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. Other Indian Ocean populations exist on the <b>Seychelles,</b> including Aldabra and Cosmoledo, but the coconut crab is extinct on the central islands. Coconut crabs occur on several of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. They occur {{on most of the}} islands, and the northern atolls, of the Chagos Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Early in its duration, Alibera {{produced}} gusty winds in the <b>Seychelles.</b> Upon moving ashore in Madagascar, the cyclone lashed {{coastal cities}} with heavy rainfall {{and up to}} 250-km/h (150-mph) wind gusts. In Mananjary, nearly every building was damaged or destroyed, and locals considered it the worst storm since 1925. Across the region, the cyclone destroyed large areas of crops, thousands of houses, and several roads and bridges. Alibera killed 46people and left 55,346people homeless. After the storm, the Malagasy government requested for international assistance.|$|E
5|$|Elita dropped heavy {{rainfall}} {{of more than}} 200mm (8inches), which damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Madagascar. Over 50,000people were left homeless, primarily in Mahajanga and Toliara provinces. Flooding from the storm ruined more than 450km² (170sqmi) of agricultural land, including important crops for food. Across the island, the cyclone caused 33deaths, with its impact further compounded by Cyclone Gafilo about two months later. Elsewhere, Elita brought rainfall and damage to Mozambique and Malawi, and its outer wind circulation produced rough seas and strong gusts in <b>Seychelles,</b> Mauritius, and Réunion.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Zimbabwe counted 21 {{publications}} {{per million}} inhabitants in internationally catalogued journals, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). This placed Zimbabwe sixth {{out of the}} 15 SADC countries, behind Namibia (59), Mauritius (71), Botswana (103) and, above all, South Africa (175) and the <b>Seychelles</b> (364). The average for sub-Saharan Africa was 20 scientific publications per million inhabitants, compared to a global average of 176 per million.|$|E
5|$|Newcome {{initially}} {{took his}} prize to Mahé in the <b>Seychelles,</b> where he demanded fresh supplies, particularly water, for his prisoners. The French governors {{of the islands}} refused, and Newcome stormed and seized the town, taking all of the supplies and military stores. The wounded and sick prisoners were disembarked, and {{the contents of a}} small French brig were turned over to the inhabitants to replace the seized supplies. Newcome then returned to India with his prize, but the ship was not subsequently purchased by the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April, Fantala turned {{more to the}} west-northward {{toward the}} {{southern}} islands of the <b>Seychelles,</b> steered by a strengthening ridge near Madagascar. Intensification resumed by 12:00UTC the following day, with the JTWC estimating 1-minute sustained winds of 270km/h (165mph), classifying Fantala as a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Around 15:00UTC, the cyclone moved through the Farquhar Group of the <b>Seychelles,</b> and its eyewall moved over several small islands. At 18:00UTC on 17 April, the MFR upgraded Fantala to a very intense tropical cyclone; based on a Dvorak T-number of T7.5, the satellite-derived wind estimate was 10-minute sustained winds of 250km/h (155mph), along with an estimated barometric pressure of 910mbar (hPa; 26.87inHg). However, in the best track for Fantala, the MFR concluded that Fantala had been a very intense tropical cyclone 6 hours earlier as well, with 10-minute sustained winds of 220km/h (140mph), and that its minimum central pressure of 910mbar (hPa; 26.87inHg) had occurred 12 hours later, at 06:00UTC the following day. The JTWC also estimated peak 1minute winds of 285km/h (180mph).|$|E
5|$|The 2015–16 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} a {{slightly}} below average event in tropical cyclone formation. The annual cyclone season began on November15, 2015, {{with the first}} storm, Annabelle, forming four days following. The final and strongest storm, Fantala, dissipated on April23, 2016, {{a week before the}} season ended on April30 for most of the region. In Mauritius and the <b>Seychelles,</b> the cyclone season ended half a month later, on May15. The season's activity was influenced by an ongoing El Niño, and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), {{which is}} a joint United States Navy– United States Air Force task force that issues {{tropical}} cyclone warnings for the region, also issued advisories for storms in the year. The agency tracked a tropical depression in July 1982. The system formed on July4 southeast of <b>Seychelles,</b> and initially curved to the southwest. It failed to intensify beyond winds of 55km/h (35mph), and dissipated on July4 after turning to the northwest. At the time, the annual tropical cyclone year was from August1 to July31 of the subsequent year.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the scale}} of the cyclone damage, the {{government}} issued an international appeal for assistance. As a result, the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs provided a grant of $30,000. UNICEF provided about $48,000 to secure drug kits for children impacted by the cyclone. The Red Cross of <b>Seychelles</b> donated about one tonne of clothing and 20tonnes of tuna, and the Red Cross of Réunion sent drugs to Madagascar. The government of France also sent a crew from Réunion to Madagascar to assist in the aftermath, as well as a plane to airdrop the aid. The governments of Germany, Japan, France, the United Kingdom each donated about $100,000 to Madagascar, while the United States provided about $25,000 and 500tons of food. The government of Japan also sent 2,040blankets and 10tents. By February18, the total contributions by the international community reached about $3million.|$|E
5|$|Mississauga Track and Field Club member Jared Lewis {{qualified}} for the men’s 100m sprint. At the Beijing Olympics, {{the first round of}} Lewis’ event took place on 14 August. Lewis was placed in Heat 3, competing against athletes such as Trinidad and Tobago’s Richard Thompson, who would later win silver in the event. Lewis ran his event in 11.00seconds, ranking seventh among of eight competitors, 0.29seconds ahead of Kiribati’s Rabangaki Nawai and 0.54seconds slower than Indonesia’s Suryo Agung Wibowo. Thompson, who took first place in the heat, was 0.76 seconds faster than Lewis. Overall, Lewis tied Danny D'Souza of the <b>Seychelles</b> for 63rd place out of 80 people and did not advance to the second round, which took place on the same day.|$|E
5|$|Nineteen-year-old Los Angeles area-born athlete Shanahan Sanitoa participated on American Samoa's behalf at the Beijing Olympics. He was {{the only}} American Samoan Olympian {{involved}} in any track and field event. Also, his appearance in Beijing {{marked the first time}} he appeared in an Olympic games. He participated in the fifth heat during the August 14 qualification round, completing the event in 12.60seconds and placing last in his heat of eight athletes. Danny D'Souza of the <b>Seychelles</b> ranked just ahead of Sanitoa (11.00seconds). The leaders of Sanitoa's heat included the United States' Tyson Gay (10.22seconds) and Nigeria's Olusoji Fasuba (10.29seconds). Overall, the American Samoan runner ranked last out of the 80 athletes who participated in the qualification round. He did not progress to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|One of the widest-ranging {{deepwater}} sharks, the Portuguese dogfish is patchily distributed {{around the}} world. In the western Atlantic, it occurs from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to the U.S. state of Delaware. In the eastern Atlantic, {{it is found}} from Iceland to Sierra Leone, including the western Mediterranean Sea, the Azores and Madeira, {{as well as from}} southern Namibia to western South Africa. In the Indian Ocean, this species has been caught off the <b>Seychelles.</b> In the Pacific, this shark occurs off Japan, New Zealand, and Australia from Cape Hawke, New South Wales, to Beachport, South Australia, including Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} has two {{geographical}} races which are sometimes classified as full species, the western cattle egret, B. ibis, and eastern cattle egret, B. coromandus. The two forms were split by McAllan and Bruce, but {{were regarded as}} conspecific by almost all other recent authors until {{the publication of the}} influential Birds of South Asia. The eastern subspecies B. (i.) coromandus, described by Pieter Boddaert in 1783, breeds in Asia and Australasia, and the western nominate form occupies the rest of the species range, including the Americas. Some authorities recognise a third <b>Seychelles</b> subspecies, B. i. seychellarum, which was first described by Finn Salomonsen in 1934.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} nests in colonies, which are often, but not always, found around bodies of water. The colonies are usually found in {{woodlands}} near lakes or rivers, in swamps, or on small inland or coastal islands, and are sometimes shared with other wetland birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises and cormorants. The breeding season varies within South Asia. Nesting in northern India {{begins with the}} onset of monsoons in May. The breeding season in Australia is November to early January, with one brood laid per season. The North American breeding season lasts from April to October. In the <b>Seychelles,</b> the breeding season of the subspecies B.i. seychellarum is April to October.|$|E
5|$|The major {{international}} tournament in Africa is organised by the Confederation of Southern African Netball Associations, which invites teams from Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Malawi, South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zimbabwe and the <b>Seychelles</b> to take part. The tournament is hosted by a country within the region; senior and under 21 teams compete. The tournament {{has served as}} a qualifier for the World Championships. South Africa launched a new domestic competition in 2011 called Netball Grand Series. It features eight regional teams from South Africa and is aimed at increasing the amount of playing time for players. It runs for 17 weeks and replaces the National Netball League, which was played over only two weeks. According to Proteas captain Elsje Jordaan, it was hoped that the competition would create an opportunity for players to become professional.|$|E
