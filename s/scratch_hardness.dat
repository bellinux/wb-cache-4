The earliest test was developed by mineralogist Friedrich Mohs in 1820 (see Mohs scale). It is based on relative <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness,</b> with talc assigned a value of 1 and diamond assigned a value of 10. Mohs' scale had two limitations; it was not linear, and most modern abrasives fall between 9 and 10.|$|E

40|$|A new {{scratch test}} {{methodology}} is proposed. The new test methodology is developed {{based on the}} principles of materials science and solid mechanics, which include the consideration of material parameters, use of microscopy for image analysis and the finite element method (FEM). The consistency and reproducibility of test results are shown using a new scratch test device on two sets of neat and talcfilled polypropylene (PP) systems. Three different test conditions, i. e., linear load increase under constant rate, constant load under constant rate, and linear rate increase under constant load, have been conducted to determine the most effective, informative test conditions for evaluation of scratch resistance of polymers. Experimental observations and FEM results show a good qualitative correlation. The unique advantages of the new scratch test method for evaluating scratch resistance of polymers are discussed. A systematic study of surface damage effected by a progressive scratching load is performed on model polypropylene (PP) systems. Mar-scratch and stress -whitening transitions can be readily observed, and the corresponding critical loads determined. Distinctive <b>scratch</b> <b>hardnesses</b> and surface damage features are found for different material systems. Visibility of scratched surface is quantified using gray level analysis via a flatbed scanner and a commercial image analysis tool. It is found that the onset of scratch visibility can be determined accurately and reproducibly using the custom -built scratcher under progressive loading condition. Talc particles are found to be responsible for the increased light scattering, leading to greatly increased visibility. The observed scratch visibility is also found {{to be related to the}} measured frictional force profiles. Approaches for producing scratch resistant PP are discussed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> is {{the measure}} of how {{resistant}} a sample is to fracture or permanent plastic deformation due to friction from a sharp object. The principle is that an object made of a harder material will scratch an object made of a softer material. When testing coatings, <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> refers to the force necessary {{to cut through the}} film to the substrate. The most common test is Mohs scale, which is used in mineralogy. One tool to make this measurement is the sclerometer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the top coating on the basic {{mechanical}} properties of a lacquered surface, including indentation <b>hardness,</b> <b>scratch</b> resistance and abrasion resistance. Three types of the top coating were used, including a 2 K polyurethane coating, a 2 K acrylate-isocyanate coating and a 2 K alkyd-urethane coating. Samples of two wood species, spruce (Picea abies Karst.) and oak (Quercus robur L.), were used in this study, in order to determine whether the wood species, which is not in direct contact with the top coating, has an impact on the mechanical properties of a lacquered surface. The samples coated with a 2 K acrylate-isocyanate coating showed the highest values of indentation hardness, in the samples of both wood species (1. 34 N for spruce; 1. 4 N for oak). The samples coated with a 2 K alkyd-urethane coating showed the highest values of scratch resistance (20 N for both wood species) and abrasion resistance (mass loss of 480 mg after 700 cycles for both wood species). The results have shown that the wood species does not affect the value of indentation <b>hardness,</b> <b>scratch</b> resistance and abrasion resistance of a lacquered surface...|$|R

50|$|The {{hardness}} of ReB2 exhibits considerable anisotropy {{because of}} its hexagonal layered structure (see structure model), being greatest along the c axis. In contrast to the <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> test, its indentation hardness (HV ~ 22 GPa) is much {{lower than that of}} diamond and is comparable to that of tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, titanium diboride or zirconium diboride.|$|E
50|$|Hardness is {{a measure}} of how {{resistant}} solid matter is to various kinds of permanent shape change when a compressive force is applied. Some materials (e.g. metals) are harder than others (e.g. plastics). Macroscopic hardness is generally characterized by strong intermolecular bonds, but the behavior of solid materials under force is complex; therefore, there are different measurements of hardness: <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness,</b> indentation hardness, and rebound hardness.|$|E
50|$|Mohs {{scale of}} mineral {{hardness}}, based on <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> comparison, defines value 1 as the hardness of talc. As such, talc {{can easily be}} scratched by a fingernail. Talc has a specific gravity of 2.5-2.8, a clear or dusty luster, and is translucent to opaque. Talc is not soluble in water, but is slightly soluble in dilute mineral acids. Its color ranges from white to grey or green {{and it has a}} distinctly greasy feel. Its streak is white.|$|E
5000|$|They exhibit plasticity—the {{ability to}} {{permanently}} change shape {{in response to}} the force, but remain in one piece. The yield strength is the point at which elastic deformation gives way to plastic deformation. Deformation in the plastic range is non-linear, and is described by the stress-strain curve. This response produces the observed properties of <b>scratch</b> and indentation <b>hardness,</b> as described and measured in materials science. Some materials exhibit both elasticity and viscosity when undergoing plastic deformation; this is called viscoelasticity.|$|R
25|$|The Mohs {{scale of}} mineral {{hardness}} is a non-linear scale of common minerals' resistances to scratching. Diamond {{is at the}} top of this scale (hardness 10), as it is one of the hardest naturally occurring materials known. (Some artificial substances, such as aggregated diamond nanorods, are harder.) Since a diamond is unlikely to encounter substances that can scratch it, other than another diamond, diamond gemstones are typically free of <b>scratches.</b> Diamond's <b>hardness</b> also is visually evident (under the microscope or loupe) by its highly lustrous facets (described as adamantine) which are perfectly flat, and by its crisp, sharp facet edges. For a diamond simulant to be effective, it must be very hard relative to most gems. Most simulants fall far short of diamond's hardness, so they can be separated from diamond by their external flaws and poor polish.|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of sol-gel-based {{transparent}} inorganic-organic nano composites has been developed by increasing the inorganic phase dimension to values just below the point, where scattering can be neglected. For this purpose, nanosized boehmite particles ≤ 50 nm are homogeneously incorporated in a sol based on tetraethoxysilane and an epoxysilane. The nanoscale boehmite particles act as catalysts for the polymerization of the epoxy silane to polyethylene oxide, as proved by 13 C NMR, and are linked to them matrix by Si-O-Al bridges, as proven by 27 Al- NMR spectroscopy. The synthesized sols can be applied by standard coating techniques on transparent polymers and are cured thermally. The mechanical properties (<b>scratch</b> resistance, <b>hardness)</b> have been substantially improved compared to systems with molecular dimensions of the inorganic phase. The effect is attributed to the special structure of flexibly suspended nano-scale boehmite particles in an inroganic-organic network by a tailored interface...|$|R
50|$|A nanoindenter is {{the main}} {{component}} for indentation hardness tests used in nanoindentation. Since the mid-1970s nanoindentation has become the primary method for measuring and testing very small volumes of mechanical properties. Nanoindentation, also called depth sensing indentation or instrumented indentation, gained popularity {{with the development of}} machines that could record small load and displacement with high accuracy and precision. The load displacement data can be used to determine modulus of elasticity, hardness, yield strength, fracture toughness, <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> and wear properties.|$|E
50|$|Gypsum is a soft sulfate mineral {{composed}} of calcium sulfate dihydrate, with the chemical formula CaSO4·2H2O. It is widely mined {{and is used}} as a fertilizer, and as the main constituent in many forms of plaster, blackboard chalk and wallboard. A massive fine-grained white or lightly tinted variety of gypsum, called alabaster, has been used for sculpture by many cultures including Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Ancient Rome, the Byzantine Empire and the Nottingham alabasters of Medieval England. Mohs scale of mineral hardness, based on <b>scratch</b> <b>Hardness</b> comparison, defines hardness value 2 as gypsum. It forms as an evaporite mineral and as a hydration product of anhydrite.|$|E
50|$|Mangalloy {{has been}} used in the mining industry, cement mixers, rock crushers, railway {{switches}} and crossings, crawler treads for tractors and other high impact and abrasive environments. It is also used in high impact environments like inside a shot peening machine. These alloys are finding new uses as cryogenic steels, due to their high strength at very low temperatures. Mangalloy is heat treatable, but the manganese lowers the temperature at which austenite transforms into ferrite. Unlike carbon steel, mangalloy softens rather than hardens when rapidly cooled, restoring the ductility from a work-hardened state. Most grades are ready for use after annealing and then quenching from a yellow heat, with no further need of tempering, and usually have a normal Brinell hardness of around 200 HB, (roughly the same as 304 stainless steel), but, due to its unique properties, the indentation hardness has very little effect on determining the <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> (the abrasion and impact resistance of the metal). Another source says that the basic Brinnell hardness of manganese steel according to the original Hadfield specification is 220 but that with impact wear the surface hardness will increase to over 550.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of different heat treatment and varnish application combinations on <b>hardness,</b> <b>scratch</b> resistance, and glossiness of wood materials sampled from limba (Terminalia superba), iroko (Chlorophora excelsa), ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), and Anatolian chestnut (Castenea sativa Mill.) species. The heat treatment was applied at two levels (150 and 180 oC) for both 3 and 6 hour periods. After the heat treatment, four types of varnish (cellulose lacquer, synthetic varnish, polyurethane varnish, and water based varnish) were applied, and <b>hardness,</b> <b>scratch</b> resistance, and glossiness of varnish film layers of the treated woods were measured. The effects of heat treatment and varnish combination applications on above mentioned variables were analyzed according to the study design (factorial design with 4 (species) x 2 (heat) x 2 (duration) x 4 (varnish) = 64 experimental units) with 10 samples for each combination of parameters. Glossiness increased on wood samples for all of the four wood species treated with cellulose lacquer and synthetic varnish and across all heating treatments. However, glossiness values were decreased for all the wood species depending on heating temperature and time. Values of <b>hardness</b> and <b>scratch</b> resistance were also decreased for all the four wood species across all the treatment combinations. The results were obtained from the upper surface of the application process and are thought to contribute to the national economy...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} previously that, for single and polycrystalline copper (fcc), the indentation size effect and the grain size effect (GSE) can be combined in a single length-scale-dependent deformation mechanism linked to a characteristic length-scale calculable by a dislocation-slip-distance approach (X. D. Hou and N. M. Jennett, ‘Application of a modified slip-distance theory to the indentation of single-crystal and polycrystalline copper to model the interactions between indentation size and structure size effects,’ Acta Mater., Vol. 60, pp. 4128 – 4135, 2012). Recently, we identified a ‘lateral size effect (LSE) ’ in <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> measurements in single crystal copper, where the <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> increases when the scratch size is reduced (A. Kareer, X. D. Hou, N. M. Jennett and S. V. Hainsworth ‘The existence of a lateral size effect {{and the relationship between}} indentation and scratch hardness’ Philos. Mag. published online 24 March 2016). This paper investigates the effect of grain size on the <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> of polycrystalline copper with average grain sizes between 1. 2 and 44. 4 μm, when using a Berkovich indenter. Exactly the same samples are used as in the indentation investigation by Hou et al. (‘Application of a modified slip-distance theory to the indentation of single-crystal and polycrystalline copper to model the interactions between indentation size and structure size effects,’ Acta Mater., Vol. 60, pp. 4128 – 4135, 2012). It is shown that, not only does the <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> increase with decreasing grain size, but that the GSE and LSE combine in reciprocal length (as found previously for indentation) rather than as a superposition of individual stresses. Applying the same (as indentation) dislocation-slip-distance-based size effect model to <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> yielded a good fit to the experimental data, strongly indicating that it is the slip-distance-like combined length-scale that determines <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness.</b> A comparison of the fit parameters obtained by indentation and scratch on the same samples is made and some distinct differences are identified. The most striking difference is that <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> is over four times more sensitive to grain size than is indentation hardness...|$|E

40|$|Variation in {{the scratch}} {{behaviour}} of polymers with incorporation {{of different types}} and amounts of fillers was investigated {{both in terms of}} scratch visibility and <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness.</b> Scratch tests were carried out by a microscratch tester. The effect of fillers on the scratch deformation mode and hence on scratch visibility was evaluated by examining recorded penetration depth and acoustic emission traces together with optical microscope images of the groove left on the surface. <b>Scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> was determined by using a recently proposed scratch model. Adequacy of the model to interpret the local phenomenon induced by addition of fillers was questioned. It was demonstrated that incorporation of hard fillers can enhance the <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> of polymers as well as their basic mechanical properties but leads to an increase in scratch visibility due to a change in scratch deformation mode from ductile ploughing to a brittle failure with crack formation. On the contrary, addition of soft fillers causes a reduction in <b>scratch</b> <b>hardness</b> but it also reduces scratch visibility since it improves the recovery characteristics of the polymer...|$|E
