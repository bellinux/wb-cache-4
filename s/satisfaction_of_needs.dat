2500|$|Hull's {{emphasis}} was on experimentation, an organized theory of learning, {{and the nature of}} habits, which he argued were associations between a stimulus and a response. Behaviors were influenced by goals that sought to satisfy primary drives—such as hunger, thirst, sex, and the avoidance of pain. His systematic behavior theory, also known as drive theory, is that of a reinforcement system, which means that in learning, habits are initially formed by reinforcing certain behaviors. [...] Reinforcement of a response to a behavior supplies an effect that satisfies a need. [...] In other words, this <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>needs</b> helps create habits out of behaviors. [...] Specifically, Hull’s theory posits that behaviors that satisfy needs, later described by Hull as cravings rather than needs, reduce these cravings.

50|$|Changes {{regarding}} {{the importance and}} <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>needs</b> from the retrospective peacetime to the wartime due to stress varied significantly across cultures (the US vs. the Middle East). For the US citizens, {{there was only one}} level of needs since all needs were considered equally important. With regards to <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>needs</b> during the war, in the US there were three levels: physiological needs, safety needs, and psychological needs (social, self-esteem, and self-actualization). During the war, the satisfaction of physiological needs and safety needs were separated into two independent needs while during peacetime, they were combined as one. For the people of the Middle East, the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>needs</b> changed from three levels to two during wartime.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} explores how {{competition}} and gaming expertise affect the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> competence <b>needs</b> and gaming gratifications. We demonstrate that competition moderates {{the effect of}} gaming expertise on the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> competence <b>needs,</b> which in turn affects game enjoyment and replay intention. Gaming expertise predicted players' need satisfaction, game enjoyment, and replay intention significantly better in a competitive compared to a noncompetitive context. The effect of gaming expertise on game enjoyment and replay intention was, furthermore, mediated by the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> competence <b>needs.</b> Finally, gaming expertise positively affected the importance of competition for players' self-esteem only in the competitive gaming context. The present findings demonstrate the importance of competition and gaming expertise for the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> competence <b>needs,</b> gaming gratifications, {{and the pursuit of}} self-esteem during gameplay, attesting to the applicability of self-determination theory to gaming contexts...|$|R

The variables considered were: perceived motivational climate, perceived <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> psychological <b>needs</b> in sport, the self-determination index, perceived sportsmanlike behaviours. The structural equation Modelling (seM) provided support for the predicted model: the perceived mastery climate positively predicted perceived <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> psychological <b>needs</b> in sport. Moreover, <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> psychological <b>needs</b> predicted the self-determination index, which in turn was positively related to the two dimensions of sportsmanship: “social conventions” and “respect for rules, judges and referees”.

Murphy believed that perception fulfills multiple roles beyond relaying the sensory information to the brain. It was a way of fulfilling needs as well.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the explanatory role <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> parental psychological <b>needs</b> in effects <b>of</b> childhood aggression on various adolescent-perceived parenting behaviors in middle adolescence. Research questions were examined in a large multi-informant, prospective community study of ethnic majority Belgian families (N= 609, 49. 7 % girls). Aggression was rated by parents when children were in middle childhood (M-age= 7. 5 years) using the Child Behavior Checklist. Parents reported on <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> their <b>needs</b> for autonomy, competence, and relatedness when children were in preadolescence (M-age= 10. 5 years) and early adolescence (M-age= 13. 5 years) using the Parenting Stress Index. Parenting behaviors were rated by adolescents in early adolescence (M-age= 13. 5 years) and in middle adolescence (M-age= 15. 5 years), using the Parenting Scale (overreactive discipline), the Psychological Control Scale, Youth Self-Report (psychological control), and the Parenting Practices Questionnaire (warmth). Mediation of associations from aggression to parenting by parents' psychological needs was examined using multiple mediation structural equation modeling analyses. Childhood aggression was related to decreased <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> parents' <b>needs</b> for competence, relatedness, and autonomy in early adolescence. <b>Satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> parents' <b>needs</b> for relatedness and, to a lesser extent, competence affected later parenting, and <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> all three <b>needs</b> affected changes in parenting.

5000|$|Allocation {{of scarce}} {{resources}} was {{a moral issue}} to Aristotle.

(To Aristotle, the question was a moral one: in his era child mortality was high.) In transactions, Aristotle used the labels of [...] "natural" [...] and [...] "unnatural". Natural transactions were related to the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>needs</b> and yielded wealth that was limited in quantity by the purpose it served. Un-natural transactions aimed at monetary gain and the wealth they yielded was potentially without limits. He explained the un-natural wealth had no limits because it became an end in itself rather than a means to another end—satisfaction of needs. This distinction is the basis for Aristotle's moral rejection of usury.|$|E
5000|$|... "Leisure {{refers to}} {{activities}} {{that a person}} voluntarily engages in when they are free from any work, social or familial responsibilities." [...] Leisure satisfaction is the positive perceptions or feelings that an individual forms, elicits and gains {{as a result of}} engaging in leisure activities and choices. What can contribute to leisure satisfaction is to what degree an individual is currently satisfied with their leisure experiences and activities. An individual might attain positive feelings of contentment and happiness that result from the <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>needs.</b> Participation in leisure activities and leisure satisfaction are inextricably linked to an individual's health. Caldwell (2005) suspects that leisure activities may be associated with a number of defensive traits that enhance a person's resiliency to negative life experiences. Some aspects of leisure activities that can act as protective factors include: [...] "activity being personally meaningful, intrinsically interesting and/or challenging; offering social support and friendships; contributing to a sense of competence and/or self efﬁcacy; offering a sense of personal control, choice and self-determination; and being relaxing and/or distracting the individual from negative life events." [...] Leisure activities, although ranging in types, have also proven to be beneficial to health cross-culturally.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the tenets}} of {{self-determination}} theory, the present studies examined the moderating effects of interpersonal contexts or goal conditions that afforded <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> psychological <b>needs</b> on loss aversion effects. We hypothesized that behavioural responses to small losses would be stronger relative to behavioural responses to small gains under goal conditions or interpersonal contexts that did not support psychological needs. We also expected the effect to be minimized under goal conditions or interpersonal contexts that supported psychological needs. This prediction was supported in Study 1 that induced <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> psychological <b>needs</b> via manipulations <b>of</b> interpersonal context and in Study 2 that instigated <b>satisfaction</b> <b>of</b> psychological <b>needs</b> via manipulations <b>of</b> goal contents. In addition, Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that psychological needs reduced the classic loss aversion effect by increasing behavioural and affective responses to gains and not because psychological needs altered affective or behavioural responses to losses. Results of the present studies support the conclusion that contextual autonomy support and the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic goals proposed by self-determination theory define a boundary condition of the loss aversion hypothesis.
