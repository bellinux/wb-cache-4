The total {{primary energy consumption}} from crude oil (212.7 Mtoe; 29.38%), natural gas (45.1 Mtoe; 6.23%), coal (411.9 Mtoe; 56.90%), nuclear energy (8.6 Mtoe; 1.19%), hydro electricity (29.1 Mtoe; 4.01%) and renewable power (16.5 Mtoe; 2.28%) is 723.9 Mtoe (excluding traditional biomass use) in the calendar year 2016. In 2013, India's net imports are nearly 144.3 million tons of crude oil, 16 Mtoe of LNG and 95 Mtoe coal totalling to 255.3 Mtoe of primary energy which is equal to 42.9% of total primary energy consumption. About 70% of India's electricity generation capacity is from fossil fuels. India is largely dependent on fossil fuel imports to meet its energy demands – by 2030, India's dependence on energy imports is expected to exceed 53% of the country's total energy consumption. In 2009-10, the country imported 159.26 million tonnes of crude oil which amounts to 80% of its domestic crude oil consumption and 31% of the country's total imports are oil imports. By the end of calendar year 2015, India has become a power <b>surplus</b> <b>country</b> with huge power generation capacity idling for want of electricity demand.

2500|$|When {{exchange}} rates are fixed by a rigid gold standard, or when imbalances exist {{between members of}} a currency union such as the Eurozone, the standard approach to correct imbalances is by making changes to the domestic economy. [...] To a large degree, the change is optional for the <b>surplus</b> <b>country,</b> but compulsory for the deficit country. [...] In {{the case of a}} gold standard, the mechanism is largely automatic. [...] When a country has a favourable trade balance, as a consequence of selling more than it buys it will experience a net inflow of gold. [...] The natural effect of this will be to increase the money supply, which leads to inflation and an increase in prices, which then tends to make its goods less competitive and so will decrease its trade surplus. [...] However the nation has the option of taking the gold out of economy (sterilising the inflationary effect) thus building up a hoard of gold and retaining its favourable balance of payments. On the other hand, if a country has an adverse BoP it will experience a net loss of gold, which will automatically have a deflationary effect, unless it chooses to leave the gold standard. Prices will be reduced, making its exports more competitive, and thus correcting the imbalance. While the gold standard is generally considered to have been successful up until 1914, correction by deflation to the degree required by the large imbalances that arose after WWI proved painful, with deflationary policies contributing to prolonged unemployment but not re-establishing balance. Apart from the US most former members had left the gold standard by the mid-1930s.|$|E

Significant shifts among producers have occurred over time. Cattle production worldwide is differentiated by animal genetics and feeding methods, resulting in differing quality types. Cattle are basically residual claimants to crop or land resources. Those countries with excess or low-value land tend to grass-feed their cattle herds, while those countries with excess feed grains, such as the U.S. and Canada, finish cattle with a grain ration. Grain-fed cattle have more internal fat (i.e., marbling) which results in a more tender meat than forage-fed cattle of a similar age.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{emergence}} of large current account imbalances in a few large countries, the factors behind the emergence, the role of those imbalances in the financial crisis of 2008 - 09, {{and the implications of}} achieving global balance. Imbalances reflect a country’s net savings and suggest that growth in GDP of a <b>surplus</b> <b>country</b> is partly dependent upon growth in external demand of deficit countries. Although a country can incur a surplus or deficit for ever, we suggest that the increasing surpluses of relatively large and rapidly growing countries is likely to be destabilizing to global growth in the long-run.

In both periods, U. S. policy makers pointed out the underdeveloped and closed financial markets of the current account <b>surplus</b> <b>countries</b> and advocated for these countries to fix the deficiencies, a position akin to the current "saving glut" argument. In both episodes, the current account <b>surplus</b> <b>countries</b> have criticized the United States for its low saving, especially public saving (the "Twin Deficit" argument). This paper presents empirical findings that are consistent with the Twin Deficit hypothesis; A one percentage point increase in the budget balance raises the current account balance by 0. 10 - 0. 49 percentage point for industrialized countries. The saving glut argument seems to be applicable only for countries with highly developed legal systems and open financial markets. While the United States has been experiencing a savings drought in both episodes, the Japanese current account surplus was driven by underinvestment in the 1980 s and by over-saving during the 2000 s.

40|$|Whenever {{there exists}} {{persistent}} current account imbalances between countries, the <b>surplus</b> <b>country</b> is often accused of undervaluing its exchange rate to give its exports an unfair advantage, {{and is thus}} pressured into letting its exchange rate appreciate. A forensic exploration of the embittered trade history between the United States and Japan is undertaken to refute these claims. This paper seeks to demonstrate that such an accusation is faulty. Firstly, such an accusation does not specify by which measure an exchange rate is undervalued. Secondly, even if an exchange rate is undervalued by a specified measure, {{it does not follow}} automatically that an undervalued exchange rate is a deliberate mercantilist policy that gives exports an unfair advantage.

40|$|I got several {{comments}} from my audience {{to the effect}} that the story on the invention of real bills and discounting has only historical interest, and hardly any relevance to contemporary affairs. Actually, if the world is ever to return to a gold standard, we have to understand how it worked in the past. My researches show that economists have not succeeded in explaining its operation. They approached the issue from the position of mercantilism and from that of the Quantity Theory of Money. For example, theyexplained the adjustment mechanism governing foreign trade in terms of the international gold standard as follows. A country running a trade surplus is gaining gold while another running a deficit is losing it. The money supply of the <b>surplus</b> <b>country</b> grows, and that of the deficit country contracts. Other things being the same, there will be an increase in the price level in the surplus and a decrease in the deficit country. In the absence of trade barriers the <b>surplus</b> <b>country</b> will export less and import more, while the deficit country will export more and import less. This process will continue until the trade surplus/deficit disappears. International gold flows tend to reestablish equilibrium in the foreign trade accounts of gold standard countries, through their effect on the price level. So goes the argument. However, the available trade statistics show that this was not at all what was happening. International gold flows were negligible, and they were moved by other factors than payment for net imports. In fact, the adjustment mechanism worked not on the relative price levels, but on the discount rates of the trading countries. We must have a new theory of foreign trade, purged from the influence of mercantilism and the Quantity Theory of Money. In these Lectures I intend to develop this new theory of the gold standard in terms of the Real Bills Doctrine. Let us now return to The Secon...|$|E
