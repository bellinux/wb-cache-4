40|$|Particle size {{analyses}} of a raw material are commonplace in the mineral processing industry. Knowledge of particle size distributions {{is crucial in}} planning milling operations to enable an optimum degree of liberation of valuable mineral phases, to minimize plant losses due to an excess of oversize or undersize material or to attain a size distribution that fits a contractual specification. The problem addressed in the present paper is how to test the equality {{of two or more}} underlying size distributions when data originating from them are obtained as matched pairs. The problem flows from a desire to test for bias when sampling a stream of material using a mechanical sampling device rather than a (superior but operationally infeasible) <b>stopped</b> <b>belt</b> method. In this paper we propose a robust test procedure based on ranks as a competitor to Hotelling’s T 2. In contrast to the latter statistic, the power of the rank test is not unduly affected by the presence of outliers or of zeros among the data...|$|R

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} locking {{retractors}} {{is to provide}} the seated occupant the convenience of some free movement of the upper torso within the compartment, while providing a method of limiting this movement {{in the event of}} a crash. Most modern seat belts are stowed on spring-loaded reels called [...] "retractors" [...] equipped with inertial locking mechanisms that <b>stop</b> the <b>belt</b> from extending off the reel during severe deceleration. There are two main types of inertial seat belt lock. A webbing-sensitive lock is based on a centrifugal clutch activated by rapid acceleration of the strap (webbing) from the reel. The belt can be pulled from the reel only slowly and gradually, as when the occupant extends the belt to fasten it. A sudden rapid pull of the belt—as in a sudden braking or collision event—causes the reel to lock, restraining the occupant in position.|$|R

5000|$|A {{seat belt}} (also {{known as a}} {{seatbelt}} or safety belt) is a vehicle safety device designed to secure the occupant of a vehicle against harmful movement that may result during a collision or a sudden <b>stop.</b> A seat <b>belt</b> functions to {{reduce the likelihood of}} death or serious injury in a traffic collision by reducing the force of secondary impacts with interior strike hazards, by keeping occupants positioned correctly for maximum effectiveness of the airbag (if equipped) and by preventing occupants being ejected from the vehicle in a crash or if the vehicle rolls over.|$|R

40|$|Total-load {{sampling}} {{has been}} a perpetual problem in sediment monitoring. Usually a combination of bed-load sampling devices, suspended load suction samplers, {{and some kind of}} flume, for total flow rate, is used. Total-load, sediment-sampler-design concepts that can perform all three of these functions are proposed. The resulting designs would require installation at sites that can provide a step-overfall height about equal to the maximum channel flow depth. The concepts are simple, but appear to have been overlooked or ignored for the past many decades, and are based on a moving conveyor belt that is long and wide, with many slots, all of the same size, onto which the stream to be sampled discharges. All flow drops through the slots, and with equal sized slots each must catch a similar proportion of the total flow. Hence, only one slot needs to be collected. As a practical extension it is proposed to replace the conveyor belt with a rack having several slots that represent a short section of the total conveyor belt that is large enough so that the flow does not notice the missing belt parts. This rack is then traversed back and forth on a track through the falling nappe. Laboratory tests of this proposed sampling-assembly rack indicated that the number of the required slots is related to the channel depth and the sum of the slot openings. When the rack is composed of sufficient slots so that the slot-width sum is more than half the channel overfall depth, the system undersampled from 0 to 2 % but when there are insufficient slots whose sum represents less than one-third of the overfall depth, the system undersampled by over 8 %. The concepts are extended to the condition with a <b>stopped</b> <b>belt</b> where several sampling-slot groups are equally spaced beneath the overfall. A “test of concept” sampler assembly of the stopped-belt idea was built and tested. The sample catch across the stream was within about 4 % of expected, offering a total load sampling system where motorized equipment is difficult to install, or electric power is not available. Design and construction suggestions are presented. The catch rate can be small enough to facilitate convenient flow measurement of the catch, which can be converted to total streamflow without the need for separate channel flow measurements...|$|R

25|$|Popper has {{developed}} some equipment innovations to accommodate {{his use of}} harmonicas during onstage performances.

50|$|When Montrose did land, in April 1650, Strachan {{made good}} his words. By Leslie's orders he {{advanced}} with two troops to Tain, {{and was there}} joined by three other troops, making 230 horse in all, and by thirty-six musketeers and four hundred men of the Ross and Munro clans. On 27 April he moved west, along {{the south side of}} the Kyle of Sutherland, near the head of which Montrose was encamped, in Carbisdale, with 1,200 foot (of which 450 men were Danes or Germans), but only forty horse. By the advice of Andrew Munro, Strachan, when he was near the enemy, hid the bulk of his force, and showed only a single troop. This confirmed the statement made by Robert Munro to Montrose, that there was only one troop of horse in Ross-shire, and Montrose drew up his men on open ground south of the Culrain burn, instead of seeking shelter on the wooded heights behind. About 5 P.M. Strachan burst upon him with two troops, the rest following close in support and reserve. Montrose's men were routed and two-thirds of them killed or taken, and he himself hardly escaped for the time. After giving thanks to God on the field, the victors returned with their prisoners to Tain, and Strachan went south to receive his reward for winning the Battle of Carbisdale.

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1999 Cibernético formed another rudo faction, a {{group called}} Lucha Libre Latina (LLL), a group intent on taking over AAA that was {{inspired}} by World Championship Wrestling's New World Order. Los Vipers became a subgroup within LLL, and Abismo Negro assumed leadership of Los Vipers after Cibernético. Cibernético looked like he could repeat as Rey de Reyes winner at the 2000 Event, but was defeated by Abismo Negro in the final. A few months later Cibernético teamed up with LLL members Abismo Negro, Electroshock and Pro Wrestling Noah wrestler Shiima Nobunaga in the main event of Triplemanía VIII, only to lose to Octagón, Jushin Thunder Liger, Latin Lover and El Alebrije. While Cibernético was leading LLL Abismo Negro was rising {{through the ranks of}} AAA, bolstered by his leadership of Los Vipers. Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibernético and Abismo Negro, leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead and who should follow. On September 29, 2000, Negro defeated Cibernético in a one on one match at Verano de Escandalo 2000. When the two faced off in a steel cage match at Guerrera de Titanes 2000, the match ended without a winner, after which the rivalry between the leader and the deputy leader was put on the back burner. On June 30, 2001 Cibernético's almost three-year-long reign as Campeon de Campeones was ended when Heavy Metal won the title from him. Cibernético regained the title less than two months later, becoming the only three time Campeon de Campeones {{in the history of the}} title. Cibernético would retain the title until AAA quietly <b>stopped</b> promoting the <b>belt</b> some time in 2005. Cibernético's LLL was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of AAA founder and owner Antonio Peña and led to a match between Cibernético and Peña, who had been a wrestler before retiring in the 1980s. The two wrestled at the 2001 Guerrera de Titanes which Cibernético easily won in under three minutes. On January 20, 2002 Cibernético finally managed to defeat his longtime rival El Canek to win the UWA World Heavyweight Championship, a title he would retain for almost 10 months before El Canek regained the title on November 15, 2002.|$|R
