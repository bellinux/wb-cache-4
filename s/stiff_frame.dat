Means of {{transport}} were scanty, but Ebbo did not choose that the messengers should report the need, and bring back a bevy of animals at the burgher's expense; so the mother was mounted on the old white mare, and her sons and Heinz trusted to their feet. By setting out early on a May morning, the journey could be performed ere night, and the twilight would find them in the domains of the free city, where their small numbers would be of no importance. As to their appearance, the mother wore a black woollen gown and mantle, and a black silk hood tied under her chin, and sitting loosely round the <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> of her white cap--a nun-like garb, save for the soft brown hair, parted over her brow, and more visible than she sometimes thought correct, but her sons would not let her wear it out of sight.|$|E

50|$|Jowett through Lawrence Pomeroy of The Motor {{joined forces}} with ERA and they persuaded Eberan von Eberhorst, {{formerly}} with Auto Union, to come to England. He joined ERA in Dunstable and, amongst other projected development and chassis work, designed and developed what became the Jupiter's tubular steel chassis. The suspension used soft torsion bars and anti-roll bars front and rear with independent suspension at the front. The engine was mounted very far forward ahead of the front axle line with the radiator low behind it over the gearbox. Adjustment of the anti-roll bars easily influenced oversteer and understeer to provide fine suspension tuning. On this torsionally <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> Reg Korner of Jowett put a steel framed aluminium drophead coupé body with a bench seat for three people. Eberan's chassis had been designed for a closed coupé and it proved to require strengthening. The anti-roll bars were abandoned. There was no external access to the boot (trunk) and the bonnet (hood) was rear hinged and opened complete with the wings. These cars were only for export, it was hoped coachbuilders would supply the local market.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Stiff</b> <b>frame</b> was the {{important}} structural member in construction of replacement of closure segment for prestressed concrete cable-stayed bridges. To establish the design calculation method {{of it and}} reveal its variation of internal forces with construction stages of replacement, some configurations and its working process of <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> was introduced. Based on construction stage analysis of replacement, calculation methods of its strength and stability were given. Through FEM results, influence of <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> to structural dynamic property and global stability of whole bridge were described. Analysis results showed, it was appropriate to consider each section steel of <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> as eccentric compression member. During construction, the transversal global property of <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> and the security of its link with main girder must be valued. Construction results also proved, the theoretical calculation method could reflect the actual structural state of <b>stiff</b> <b>frame,</b> and its result was conservative. Analysis on <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> was {{an important part of}} replacement of closure segment, and could provide ways and references for construction control of replacement of closure segment...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} column hysteretic behavior on the impact response of adjacent frames in multiple-frame bridges. A simplified planar analytical bridge model is developed including inelastic frame action, nonlinear hinge behavior, and abutment effects. Pounding is simulated using a stereomechanical approach. The frame hysteretic models considered include the elasto-plastic and bilinear traditional, Q-Hyst stiffness-degrading, and pivot hysteresis strength-degrading models. Analytical studies conducted on adjacent bridge frames reveal that the traditional models underestimate the <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> displacement amplification due to pounding, and overestimate the flexible frame displacement amplification, when compared with other hysteretic models. A stiffness-degrading model is recommended to accurately estimate the pounding response of bridge frames subjected to far-field ground motion. The use of a strength-degrading model increases the <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> displacement amplification by 125 % {{when compared to the}} stiffness-degrading model for highly out-of-phase frames, and is recommended in the presence of near-field ground motions.

40|$|Seismic {{structural}} design {{is essentially the}} estimation of structural response to a forced motion, which may be deterministic or stochastic, imposed on the ground. The assumption that the same ground motion acts at every point of {{the base of the}} structure (or at every support) is not always justifiable; particularly in case of very large structures when considerable spatial variability in ground motion can exist over significant distances example long span bridges. This variability is partly due to the delay in arrival of the excitation at different supports (which is called the wave passage effect) and due to heterogeneity in the ground medium which results in incoherency and local effects. The current study examines the influence of the wave passage effect (in terms of delay in arrival of horizontal ground excitation at different supports and neglecting transmission through the structure) on the response of a few open-plane frame building structures with soil-structure interaction. The ground acceleration has been modeled by a suitably filtered white noise. As a special case, the ground excitation at different supports has also been treated as statistically independent to model the extreme case of incoherence due to local effects and due to modifications to the ground motion resulting from wave reflections and refractions in heterogeneous soil media. The results indicate that, even for relatively short spanned building frames, wave passage effect can be significant. In the absence of soil-structure interaction, it can significantly increase the root mean square (rms) value of the shear in extreme end columns for the <b>stiffer</b> <b>frames</b> but has negligible effect on the flexible frames when total displacements are considered. It is seen that pseudo-static displacements increasingly contribute to the rms value of column shear as the time delay increases both for the stiffer and for the more flexible frames. When soil-structure interaction is considered, wave passage effect (in terms of total displacements) is significant only for low soil shear modulus, G. values (where soil-structure interaction significantly lowers the fundamental frequency) and for <b>stiff</b> <b>frames.</b> The contribution of pseudo-static displacement to these rms values is found to decrease with increase in G. In general, wave passage effect for most interactive frames is insignificant compared to the attenuating effect a decrease in G, has on the response of the interactive structure to uniform support excitation. When the excitations at different supports are statistically independent, it is seen that for both the <b>stiff</b> and flexible <b>frames,</b> the rms value of the column shear in extreme end columns is several times larger (more for the <b>stiffer</b> <b>frames)</b> than the value corresponding to uniform base excitation with the pseudo-static displacements contributing over 99...|$|R
40|$|Heliostat designs {{intended}} {{to reduce costs}} {{and the effect of}} adverse wind loads on the devices were developed. Included was the low-profile heliostat consisting of a <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> with sectional focusing reflectors coupled together to turn as a unit. The entire frame is arranged to turn angularly about a center point. The ability of the heliostat to rotate about both the vertical and horizontal axes permits a central computer control system to continuously aim the sun's reflection onto a selected target. An engineering model of the basic device was built and is being tested. Control and mirror parameters, such as roughness and need for fine aiming, are being studied. The fabrication of these prototypes is in process. The model was also designed to test mirror focusing techniques, heliostat geometry, mechanical functioning, and tracking control. The model can be easily relocated to test mirror imaging on a tower from various directions. In addition to steering and aiming studies, the tests include the effects of temperature changes, wind gusting and weathering. The results of economic studies on this heliostat are also presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study on decentralized velocity feedback control on a double panel consisting of an external aluminum panel and a honeycomb trim panel. The decentralized feedback loops are formed by a 3 × 3 array of coil-magnet electrodynamic actuators that react off the trim panel and a lightweight <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> structure {{located in the}} air {{gap between the two}} panels. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometers are located {{on the opposite side of}} the trim panel in correspondence to the electrodynamic actuators. The grid structure is designed to provide an inertial reference to the actuators. In this way the velocity feedback control loops produce skyhook active damping on the double panel, which minimizes the vibrational response and sound radiation of the trim panel at low audio frequencies. Two configurations are considered where the grid structure is either weakly coupled or strongly coupled to the external panel. Both stability and control performance of the two configurations are analyzed experimentally. The study shows that the control configuration with the weakly coupled grid structure enables the implementation of larger stable feedback control gains, which lead to reductions of the sound radiated by the trim panel between 10 and 30 dB for the first seven resonance peaks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} paper the authors refer about a series of {{experimental}} tests, where an aluminium alloy square tube, filled with an aluminium foam, was crushed by a longitudinal load at a speed of 10 m/s. The test apparatus consisted of a sled installed on a very <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> moving on appropriate guides, as the specimen was set on a home-made fixture. Two arrangements of square tubes were considered as specimens: a “standard ” one and an “optimized ” one. Both crushing behaviours and energy absorption capabilities were analyzed experimentally and numerically simulated {{by means of the}} explicit FE code LS-DYNA; the complete numerical model consisted of the striker, the assemblage of square tubes and the base. A high-speed video recording system was used to capture the images from the physical test. The results from the numerical analyses were compared to those obtained from the experiments: those results showed that the force–deflection response had been overestimated by the numerical model. The authors attempted to justify this inconsistency by considering the influence of the strain rate parameters of the considered Cowper-Symonds analytical model on the results. It was shown that the “optimized ” energy absorber exhibited a more desirable force–deflection response than the standard one due to some easy design changes, which involved the insertion of aluminium foam dampers...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} five years, the Dept. of Aeronautical Engineering of the University of Naples, has carried {{out a lot of}} work, {{especially}} on the experimental side, focused on assessing the feasibility of an active vibration and noise control approach, based on the use of piezoceramic actuators and sensors bonded to different structural elements. This paper concerns an application of this technique relative to a partially curved <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> of a medium civil transport jet aircraft. The general procedure, as previously assessed on different test articles, requires as first step, the dynamic characterization of the test article, to best point out the target of control procedure in terms of deformed shapes relative to the frequency of most interest. The use of PZT piezoactuators to be bonded on the structure guarantee at the same time high actuators forces in front of a low weight increment. The hearth of the MIMO (Multi Input Multi Output) feedforward control algorithm that is usually applied, is then represented by an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) control algorithm that use the evaluation of experimental FRF as measured by reference accelerometer, to calculate the optimum control forces to be applied to the actuators to minimize a target cost function.

40|$|A {{specialised}} {{digital system}} of close range photogrammetry {{has been developed}} in the Department of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Informatics of University of Mining and Metallurgy in Cracow, Poland. The system has been implemented in two applications. The first one is related to medicine and used for overload monitoring {{for the purpose of}} medical rehabilitation, and the second one is designated for railways, to locate points on cross-sections. Calibrated images are required as input data for the system. The calibration can be performed in a laboratory, using a test field, by means of cameras with constant interior orientation parameters. For medical purposes, several points are marked on the patient's body in selected locations. Convergent photographs composed of direct photos and images reflected from a mirror located behind the patient are used to record points at the patient's front and back. The mirror allows to reduce to the minimum the numbers of stands for image recording. In this case, free-focus cameras, such as Kodak DC 200, were used. The system of reference is defined by reference points located on the mirror surface. Results of measurements are shown in a graphic form. The second application concerns locating points on railways cross-sections. Digital cameras with nearly parallel axes are placed on a special railway platform. The co-ordinates of reference points marked on the <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> structure are determined in relation to the rail head level and track axis. These cameras have a high-precision shutter synchronisation. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{innovative}} approach for voltage-tunable optical gratings based on dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) using electro active polymers is presented. Sinusoidal surface gratings, holographically written into azobenzene containing films, are transferred via nanoimprinting to DEAs of different carrier materials. We {{demonstrate that the}} surface relief deformation depends on the mechanical and geometrical properties of the actuators. The tested DEAs were made using commercially available elastomers, including a tri-block copolymer poly-styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene (SEBS), a silicone polydimethylsiloxane rubber (PDMS) and commonly used polyacrylic glue. The polyacrylic glue is ready to use, whereas the SEBS and the PDMS precursors have to be processed into thin films via different casting methods. The DEA material was pre-stretched, fixed to a <b>stiff</b> <b>frame</b> and coated with stretchable electrodes in appropriate designs. Since the actuation strain of the DEA depends strongly upon the conditions such as material properties, pre-stretch and geometry, the desired voltage-controllable deformations can be optimized during manufacturing of the DEA {{and also in the}} choice of materials in the grating transfer process. A full characterization of the grating deformation includes measurements of the grating pitch and depth modulation, plus the change of the diffraction angle and efficiency. The structural surface distortion was characterized by measuring the shape of the transmitted and diffracted laser beam with a beam profiling system while applying an electro-mechanical stress to the grating. Such surface distortions may lead to decreasing diffraction efficiency and lower beam quality. With properly chosen manufacturing parameters, we found a period shift of up to 9 % in a grating with 1 ?m pitch. To describe the optical behavior, a model based on independently measured material parameters is presented...|$|E
