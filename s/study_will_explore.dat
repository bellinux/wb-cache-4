40|$|Each year 6 to 8 million pet dogs enter shelters, and {{approximately}} 60 % are euthanized. Unfortunately, many dogs {{are taken to}} shelters or euthanized due to behavioral problems. Identifying dogs who may have these behaviors allows owners to be informed and prepared for these dogs, reducing the number returned to shelters. One way to identify potential problems may be through measuring self-control in dogs. We have adapted our methods from a similar method used with capuchin monkeys (Bramlett et al., 2012). We constructed a wheel with food that rotated in front of dog subjects. The dog had the choice to eat less-preferred kibble or wait an additional few seconds for a preferred jerky treat.

40|$|Truncating {{mutations}} {{were found}} in the PHF 8 gene (encoding the PHD finger protein 8) in two unrelated families with X linked mental retardation (XLMR) associated with cleft lip/ palate (MIM 300263). Expression studies showed that this gene is ubiquitously transcribed, with strong expression of the mouse orthologue Phf 8 in embryonic and adult brain structures. The coded PHF 8 protein harbours two functional domains, a PHD finger and a JmjC (Jumonji-like C terminus) domain, implicating it in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodelling. The association of XLMR and cleft lip/ palate in these patients with mutations in PHF 8 suggests an important function of PHF 8 in midline formation and in the development of cognitive abilities, and links this gene to XLMR associated with cleft lip/ palate. Further <b>studies</b> <b>will</b> <b>explore</b> the specific mechanisms whereby PHF 8 alterations lead to mental retardation and midline defects...|$|R

30|$|This {{study has}} {{demonstrated}} a simple process for growing high-quality SnO 2 nanowires anchored {{directly to a}} FTO thin film. Additional solution-deposited FTO coatings offer a versatile method to grow SnO 2 nanowires from any substrate that can withstand the processing conditions. The novel hierarchical nanobrushes consisting of SnO 2 nanowires and hydrothermally grown TiO 2 nanorods are promising for future applications of photocatalysis, water splitting, and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The remaining challenge is to fabricate such a device without affecting the quality or properties of the thin film or substrate. This could be overcome by fabricating a thicker FTO film that is not as susceptible to degradation with nanowire growth. The underlying glass substrate could also be substituted with sapphire or quartz to allow growth at higher temperatures without softening of the slide. Future <b>studies</b> <b>will</b> <b>explore</b> the properties of this nanostructure and its implications in fields such as catalysis, photocatalysis, and gas sensing.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} provide {{mechanical}} support to the surgical repair, the scaffold should possess (1) material properties {{similar to that of}} the native tissue and (2) suture retention strength equal to, or greater than, the surgical repair (Aurora et al. 2012). While the biomimetic scaffold met the former criterion, it exhibited a poor ability to hold suture with an ultimate pullout load of 7.2 [*]±[*] 1.6  N. Categorically, nonwoven electrospun nanofibers do not adequately hold suture. However, the implementation of textile patterns such as braiding or weaving could provide added resistance to suture pull-through (Hakimi et al. 2015; McCarron et al. 2010). To that end, future <b>studies</b> <b>will</b> <b>explore</b> fabrication methods capable of enhancing the suture retention strength of the biomimetic scaffold. Similarly, in vitro culture of cells on the biomimetic scaffold may increase mechanical properties through deposition of extracellular matrix proteins (Fisher et al. 2015) while also contributing to neotissue formation if localized to the lesion (Shimomura et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|Inspired by {{a desire}} to {{represent}} place and community artists and designers who are commissioned to create site-specific product would be well advised to seek out opportunities for collaboration with the locals. Each community is made up of sub-communities with their own agendas and priorities, it is therefore important for the designer and artist who are creating product which will ultimately reside in and become a part of a place (site specific), to implement methodologies which will provide opportunities for involvement by the broader community.
