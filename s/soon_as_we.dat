In the example we considered above, it's {{easy to see that}} the intersection of all possible models (i.e. the sure information) of the query selecting WHERE Age = 22 is actually empty because, for instance, the (unlifted) query returns no rows for the relation EmpH37. More generally, it was shown by Imielinski and Lipski that Codd tables are a weak representation system if the query language is restricted to projections, selections (and renaming of columns). However, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> add either joins or unions to the query language, even this weak property is lost, as evidenced in the next section.|$|E

25|$|On August 6 and August 7, the Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader visited Dubrovnik, {{which was}} {{followed}} by fires in that area. It prompted some county officials to make arson accusations against {{the nearby town of}} Trebinje in the neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mario Magud, the firefighting commander in Konavle, said: There are no firemen on the Trebinje side. Everything indicates that they set the fire themselves with the intention to burn Konavle and beyond. It's not a coincidence that, as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> localize one fire, a new fire breaks out.. Luka Korda, the chief of Konavle municipality, made similar accusations. The Bosnian civil defense secretary Stanko Slišković said it was not true that the Bosnian firemen did not do anything to prevent fires in the border area near Dubrovnik: Our people made the greatest effort to fight every fire where it was possible. Nobody can say with certainty where a fire started... I'm sorry this happened and I understand the indignation of the citizens of Dubrovnik, but it's not our fault. He claimed that the Bosnian civil defense cooperated well with their Croatian counterparts and said that the Bosnian forces could not fight the fires in the inaccessible or mined areas.|$|E

According to Sylvia Anderson, Bell's challenge was to produce complex interiors on a limited budget while resisting the effects department's push for [...] "more extravagant" [...] design. This task was complicated by the unnatural proportions of the puppets: Bell struggled to decide whether the sets should be built to a scale proportionate to their bodies or their oversized heads and hands. He used the example of FAB 1 to illustrate the problem: [...] "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> positioned [...] standing alongside , they looked ridiculous, as the car towered over them."

Aulie played his first career NHL game the next day against the Vancouver Canucks, playing 12 games total with the Maple Leafs in his call-up before ultimately being returned to the Marlies. Despite the time he spent away from the AHL, Aulie was selected to the Western Conference team for the AHL All-Star Game. During the Skills Competition, Aulie competed in the hardest shot event, finishing third, with a top speed of 95.5mph. After the Maple Leafs traded defenceman François Beauchemin to the Anaheim Ducks, Aulie was called up to rejoin the team.

500|$|As {{chair of}} the McGovern–Fraser Commission in 1969–70, McGovern instituted major changes in Democratic party rules that {{continue}} to this day and, to a large degree, were ultimately adopted by the Republican Party as well, with large institutional {{changes taking place in}} both. Among those was the centralization of decisions about the nominating process at the national party level, rather than with the states. His 1972 campaign fundamentally altered how presidential primary campaigns were waged. Within the Democratic Party, power shifted from the New Deal coalition to younger, more affluent, issue-oriented activists; the women's movement and gay rights movement found a place; skepticism about military buildups and foreign interventions took hold; and the 1960s [...] "New Politics" [...] found its culmination in McGovern's nomination. In turn, the overwhelming defeat of McGovern in the general election led to the liberal wing of the party's being stigmatized for decades to come and a turn in the party towards centrist directions. McGovern himself recognized the mixed results of his 1972 candidacy, saying, [...] "We made a serious effort to open the doors of the Democratic Party – and as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> did, half the Democrats walked out." [...] SUNY Albany political scientist Bruce Miroff wrote in 2007 that the McGovern campaign was the last time in presidential politics that liberals had [...] "their chance to speak of their goals with enthusiasm and their dreams with fire... Yet almost at the instant that the insurgents successfully stormed the heights of American politics, they found themselves on the brink of one of the worst free falls on record." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Letters That Cross in the Mail" [...] was {{the first}} song {{recorded}} for the album. Streisand claimed that the inspiration behind the track was simple: it is [...] "about love and the postal service". Santopietro wrote that Holmes' love for of [...] "big band sound" [...] and [...] "a full symphonic orchestra" [...] {{is evident in the}} production. Following her cover of [...] "All in Love Is Fair" [...] in 1974, seventh track [...] "You and I" [...] is Streisand's second cover of a Stevie Wonder song. Taken from his 1972 studio album Talking Book, she called the pop song [...] "immediately [...] touch" [...] and considered Wonder [...] "brilliant" [...] for his work on it. Written by Howard Dietz and Ralph Rainger, Streisand's cover of Libby Holman's [...] "Moanin' Low" [...] appears as the eighth song. In order to place focus on the lyrics during the song, the production contains [...] "octave leaps" [...] while Streisand [...] "changes timbre frequently and quickly between loud and soft sections and high and low pitches". Ninth track [...] "A Child Is Born" [...] features a simplistic piano arrangement accompanied solely by Streisand's vocals; Columbia Records executive reacted to the track's new genre for the singer, stating, [...] "You could put Barbra in front of a rock band or a symphony orchestra, she would still be Barbra Streisand, not compromising, not uncomfortable". [...] "Widescreen", the album's closing track, was inspired by the singer's love of film; according to author Patrick E. Horrigan, it specifically explains [...] "how the movies, dark and dreamlike, seduce us into believing that life can be fulfilling, then let us down as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> return to the light of day". It was also the last of four tracks written by Holmes and has a production consisting of [...] "synthesized electronics".|$|E
500|$|My Bloody Valentine were {{scheduled}} to record at Blackwing Studios in Southwark, London {{for the month of}} February 1989, and intended to use the time to conceptualise a new, more studio-based sound for their second album. Shields said that Creation first believed the album could be recorded [...] "in five days". According to Shields [...] "when it became clear that wasn't going to happen, they [...] freaked." [...] After several unproductive months, the band relocated in September to the basement studio The Elephant and Wapping, where they spent eight unproductive weeks. In-house engineer Nick Robbins said Shields made it clear from the outset that he (Robbins) [...] "was just there to press the buttons." [...] Robbins was quickly replaced by Harold Burgon, but according to Shields, Burgon's main contribution was to show the group how to use the in-studio computer. Burgon and Shields spent three weeks at the Woodcray studio in Berkshire working on the Glider EP, which Shields and Creation owner Alan McGee agreed would be released in advance of the album. Alan Moulder was hired to mix the Glider song [...] "Soon" [...] at Trident 2 studio in Victoria (the song would reappear as the closing track on Loveless). Shields said of Moulder, [...] "As <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> worked with him we realized we'd love to some more!" [...] When the group returned to work on the album Moulder was the sole engineer Shields trusted enough to perform tasks such as miking the amplifiers; all the other credited engineers were told [...] "We're so on top of this you don't even have to come to work." [...] Shields has since stated that [...] "these engineers—with the exception of Alan Moulder and later Anjali Dutt—were all just the people who came with the studio...everything we wanted to do was wrong, according to them", although the band did give credit on the album sleeve to anyone who was present during the recordings, [...] "even if all they did was fix tea", according to Shields.|$|E
