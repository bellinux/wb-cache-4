25|$|I have an {{obsession}} with death and sex. Those two things are also the nexus of horror films, which I've been obsessing over lately. I’ve been watching horror movies and 1950s science fiction movies. My re-release is called The Fame Monster so I've just been sort of bulimically eating and regurgitating monster movies and all things scary. I've just been noticing a resurgence of this idea of monster, of fantasy, but {{in a very real}} way. If you notice in those films, there’s always a juxtaposition of sex with death. That's what makes it so scary. Body and mind are primed for orgasm and instead <b>somebody</b> <b>gets</b> killed. That's the sort of sick, twisted psychological circumstance.|$|E

Liccy Dahl remembers Burton entering Dahl's famed writing shed and saying, [...] "This is the Buckets' house!" [...] and thinking to herself, [...] "Thank God, <b>somebody</b> <b>gets</b> it." [...] Liccy also showed Burton the original handwritten manuscripts, which Burton discovered were more politically incorrect than the published book. The manuscripts included a child named Herpes, after the sexually transmitted disease. Burton immediately thought of Johnny Depp {{for the role of}} Willy Wonka, who in August 2003 joined the film, his fourth collaboration with the director.|$|E

What's important to bear in mind is that a person has to be sentenced for the offence they've committed, and that might mean that <b>somebody</b> <b>gets</b> a sentence that is proportionate for the crime, but it doesn't cure them of the dangerousness or the characteristic that makes them continue to offend".|$|E

McFarlane felt was [...] "another rough’n’tumble collection of blues’n’boogie bar band rock". In November that year he contributed to De Soto's next album, Take this Veil, which was issued on the Full Moon label. Wells and De Soto worked on another Pete Wells Band album, Hateball (2000), before Wells teamed with Angry Anderson to release Damn Fine Band in 2001. Pete Wells Band issued their next album, Solo in the following February on MGM. Also in July year Rose Tattoo, with Wells aboard, released a reunion album, Pain.|$|E
2500|$|Peter William [...] "Pete" [...] Wells (31 December 194627 March 2006) was {{the founder}} and slide guitarist in Australian hard rock band, Rose Tattoo, from 1976 to 1983.

2500|$|Simon {{lived for}} many years {{in the small town of}} Makanda, Illinois, south of Carbondale, where he was a {{professor}} and director of the SIU Public Policy Institute. While there, he tried to foster the Institute into becoming a think tank that could advance the lives of all people. Activities included going to Liberia and Croatia to monitor their elections, bringing major speakers to campus, denouncing the death penalty, trying to end the United States embargo against Cuba, fostering political courage among his students, promoting amendment to the United States Constitution to end electoral college, and to limit the President to a single six-year term of office. During the electoral college fiasco that followed the 2000 election, Simon said: [...] "I think if <b>somebody</b> <b>gets</b> the majority vote, they should be president. But, I don't think the system is going to be changed." ...|$|E

60|$|All {{political}} {{meetings are}} very much alike. <b>Somebody</b> <b>gets</b> up and introduces {{the speaker of the}} evening, and then the speaker of the evening says at great length what he thinks of the scandalous manner in which the Government is behaving or the iniquitous goings-on of the Opposition. From time to time confederates in the audience rise and ask carefully rehearsed questions, and are answered fully and satisfactorily by the orator. When a genuine heckler interrupts, the orator either ignores him, or says haughtily that he can find him arguments but cannot find him brains. Or, occasionally, when the question is an easy one, he answers it. A quietly conducted political meeting is one of England's most delightful indoor games. When the meeting is rowdy, the audience has more fun, but the speaker a good deal less.|$|E
60|$|We {{probably}} {{began to}} celebrate our Fourth-of-July night {{in that way}} one hundred and twenty-five years ago, and on every Fourth-of-July night since these horrors have grown and grown, until now, in our five thousand towns of America, <b>somebody</b> <b>gets</b> killed or crippled on every Fourth-of-July night, besides those cases of sick persons whom we never hear of, who die {{as the result of}} the noise or the shock. They cripple and kill more people on the Fourth of July in, America than they kill and cripple in our wars nowadays, and there are no pensions for these folk. And, too, we burn houses. Really we destroy more property on every Fourth-of-July night than the whole of the United States was worth one hundred and twenty-five years ago. Really our Fourth of July is our day of mourning, our day of sorrow. Fifty thousand people who have lost friends, or who have had friends crippled, receive that Fourth of July, when it comes, as a day of mourning for the losses they have sustained in their families.|$|E
60|$|As to {{the train}} crew, we never had any more trouble with them than {{if they had been}} so many sheep. I don't mean that they are cowards; I mean that they have got sense. They know they're not up against a bluff. It's the same way with the officers. I've seen secret service men, marshals, and {{railroad}} detectives fork over their change as meek as Moses. I saw one of the bravest marshals I ever knew hide his gun under his seat and dig up along with the rest while I was taking toll. He wasn't afraid; he simply knew that we had the drop on the whole outfit. Besides, many of those officers have families and they feel that they oughtn't to take chances; whereas death has no terrors for the man who holds up a train. He expects to get killed some day, and he generally does. My advice to you, if you should ever be in a hold-up, is to line up with the cowards and save your bravery for an occasion when it may be of some benefit to you. Another reason why officers are backward about mixing things with a train robber is a financial one. Every time there is a scrimmage and <b>somebody</b> <b>gets</b> killed, the officers lose money. If the train robber gets away they swear out a warrant against John Doe et al. and travel hundreds of miles and sign vouchers for thousands on the trail of the fugitives, and the Government foots the bills. So, with them, {{it is a question of}} mileage rather than courage.|$|E
