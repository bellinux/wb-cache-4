40|$|With {{the rapid}} and {{continued}} spread of digital technologies, practitioners {{are starting to}} use digital media, such as computers and smartphones, in life story work. Digital life story work, as it is known, can provide exciting new opportunities for supportive conversations with young people that can help them {{to make sense of}} their past, understand their experiences and help develop their aspirations for the future. Digital media can be used in this work with children of all ages, but is most often employed with young people. This chapter focuses on work with this age group. The use of digital tools to communicate with looked after young people has been mentioned in previous influential works (Fahlberg, 1994; Ryan and Walker, 2007). However, the use of these tools in frontline practice is still not widespread (Ahmad et al, 2008; Tregeagle and Darcy, 2008; Hammond, 2009; Hammond and Cooper, 2013). This chapter explores the benefits of using digital media with young people, and shows how technology can be used in <b>simple,</b> <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> imaginative <b>ways.</b> It also details points to be considered before starting work. Like the four-year research project that informs it, this chapter is underpinned by real-world practice experiences of using digital media with looked after young people. Numerous interviews and focus groups with young people and carers were undertaken during this project, and provide quotes and case study examples of digital life story work in action...|$|R
