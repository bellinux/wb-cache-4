5|$|The {{remnants}} of Xangsane moved over Thailand on October 2 and combined with monsoonal moisture {{over the north}} {{central part of the}} country, causing torrential rains and severe flooding in over 35 provinces. Floodwaters broke through levees and barriers and flooded or damaged nearly 1.3million rai (2,100km², 520,000acres) of farmland and local infrastructure. Many municipalities reported flooding of up to three meters (10ft), and the municipality of Ang Thong reported flooding of 60cm (2ft). The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation reported 47 deaths, and villages in several provinces reported significant levels of water pollution and waterborne illnesses from <b>stagnant</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{geographic}} {{distribution of}} malaria within large regions is complex, and malaria-afflicted and malaria-free areas are often found {{close to each}} other. Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions because of rainfall, consistent high temperatures and high humidity, along with <b>stagnant</b> <b>waters</b> in which mosquito larvae readily mature, providing them with the environment they need for continuous breeding. In drier areas, outbreaks of malaria have been predicted with reasonable accuracy by mapping rainfall. Malaria {{is more common in}} rural areas than in cities. For example, several cities in the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia are essentially malaria-free, but the disease is prevalent in many rural regions, including along international borders and forest fringes. In contrast, malaria in Africa is present in both rural and urban areas, though the risk is lower in the larger cities.|$|E
5|$|On October20, the {{government}} of Cuba issued {{an appeal to the}} international community for assistance. The Red Cross provided $1.6million to the country, and various departments of the United Nations provided $80,000. The government of Japan sent about $104,000 worth of medical equipment, and Italy sent about $526,000 worth of medical supplies. The Canadian Red Cross donated a water purification unit, and the Spanish Red Cross sent blankets and cots. The German Red Cross also sent mattresses and blankets. The American Red Cross sent 9.5tons of food. Several other countries sent assistance, including the European Commission which sent $750,000 worth of supplies. There were early difficulties in transporting the relief supplies due to fuel shortages. Due to storm damage, 66,881people resided in shelters until their houses were rebuilt, or until they moved elsewhere. By March 1997, most people had returned to their homes, although some did so without a roof. There was a threat for water-borne diseases due to <b>stagnant</b> <b>waters,</b> although no such outbreaks occurred. The storm decreased the supply of the banana crop in 1997, coupled with a drought.|$|E

5|$|Portions of Central America also {{experienced}} flooding {{related to the}} rains, causing landslides and washing away bridges and roads. Over 100,000people in the region had to leave their homes, and there were 70deaths in Central America. In Guatemala, 12people died related to the flooding, including two due to cholera from <b>stagnant</b> <b>waters.</b> Officials declared a red alert in Honduras, which mobilized the army for potential relief work and caused Red Cross shelters to open; the alert was dropped after rainfall eased on October8. About 6,500people evacuated in Honduras after four rivers flooded, which damaged or destroyed several houses. About 6,000 people had to evacuate in Sula Valley in the northern portion of the country, after the government released water from the El Cajón Dam. Damage was estimated at $1.5million (14million pesos), and there were 34deaths. Due to people having to evacuate, several schools were closed. The country was severely affected by Hurricane Mitch only a year prior, and bridges that were rebuilt after the hurricane were again destroyed.|$|E

25|$|The odor {{associated}} with bogs, swamps, indeed any <b>stagnant</b> <b>waters,</b> can {{be due to}} oxygen depletion caused by the decay of deceased algal blooms. Under anoxic conditions, the bacteria inhabiting algae cultures break down the organic material and produce hydrogen sulfide and ammonia which causes the odor. This hypoxia often results {{in the death of}} aquatic animals. In a system where algae is intentionally cultivated, maintained, and harvested, neither eutrophication nor hypoxia are likely to occur.|$|E

25|$|But ASR is {{not limited}} to the {{intertidal}} environment. Most tropical and temperate fish species living in <b>stagnant</b> <b>waters</b> engage in ASR during hypoxia. One study looked at 26 species representing eight families of non-air breathing fishes from the North American great plains, and found that all but four of them performed ASR during hypoxia. Another study looked at 24 species of tropical fish common to the pet trade, from tetras to barbs to cichlids, and found that all of them performed ASR. An unusual situation in which ASR is performed is during winter, in lakes covered by ice, at the interface between water and ice or near air bubbles trapped underneath the ice.|$|E
25|$|Sir Horace Vere, {{seeing that}} the Spanish were gaining ground reacted with swift speed. He {{selected}} 100 pikemen and 200 musketeers from his brother Francis's regiment, and placed them {{under the command of}} Sir Charles Fairfax. A second detachment of 400 men, under Sir John Ogle, was to follow and 200 of Cecil's cavalry came up in support. The way was narrow, and on either side there were swamps and <b>stagnant</b> <b>waters,</b> where the sea had been let in over the polder lands. Fairfax led his men to the attack with great vigour and after a sharp engagement, he forced the Spanish to retire behind their entrenchments, and followed them so closely that they were routed. Many plunged into the swamps and flooded polders, some escaped but some drowned or were trapped. More of Ogle's men joined the fight to complete the rout.|$|E
25|$|The <b>stagnant</b> <b>waters</b> of {{the lake}} caused a wave of deadly fevers in the {{surrounding}} farms, and the new lake limits quickly became very unpopular with the local residents. On {{one day in the}} summer of 1838, settlers from the countryside surrounding the lake rose up and using axes, flintlocks and pitchforks, tore the dam apart, lowering the lake once more. No charges were laid due to the general anger towards the water height by residents, and because of a deal reached between Purdy and the Board of Works of the Province of Canada, on December 18, 1843. Mr. Purdy was forced to lower the elevation to something approximating its natural maximum spring high-water level, a reduction in the height of the previous dam by about three feet. The Board of Works constructed the dam and a lock for navigation into Lake Scugog, which was completed in 1844 and included a log flume. In exchange, Purdy relinquished all claims against the damage done by residents, and maintained the dam and flume.|$|E
50|$|Boophis goudotii is {{a common}} species {{that can be found}} in rainforests, fields, and {{disturbed}} stream sides near slow-moving or <b>stagnant</b> <b>water.</b> Its elevational range is 900 - 2200 m above sea level.

50|$|It is {{possible}} for <b>stagnant</b> <b>water</b> to become somewhat supersaturated with oxygen (i.e. reach more than 100% saturation) either {{because of the presence}} of photosynthetic aquatic oxygen producers or because of a slow equilibration after a change of atmospheric conditions. <b>Stagnant</b> <b>water</b> in the presence of decaying matter will typically have an oxygen concentration much less than 100%.|$|R

500|$|Church, in his {{description}} of the route, had failed to account for the heavy rains and the generally boggy conditions {{between the first and second}} ponds. [...] Rain and snow slowed the long portage, and the expedition had its first casualty when a falling tree killed one of the party. [...] Some of the men who drank the <b>stagnant</b> <b>waters</b> along the way became violently ill, forcing Arnold to order construction of a shelter at the second pond as cover for the sick, and to send some men back to Fort Halifax for supplies that had been cached there.|$|E
500|$|After {{the worst}} of the floods ended, the Yemeni {{government}} created a Flood Relief High Committee to coordinate incoming aid and relief distribution. The [...] Ministry of Health coordinated the transportation and storage of goods. Workers quickly repaired roads and airports. In Shabwah, CARE and Oxfam repaired damaged pumps and wells to restore access to clean water, and the German government sent a team to restore water access in Ma'rib Governorate. The widespread destruction of crop fields caused many tribes to abandon their ancestral land. Many of the residents left homeless either stayed with families or relatives, or resided in temporary shelters, where there were reports of malaria, typhoid, and diarrhea. The government provided building materials to rebuild houses. In the immediate aftermath, the local Red Cross chapter distributed about 1,300blankets, 200tents, and 200sets of cooking tools. <b>Stagnant</b> <b>waters</b> in Yemen caused a locust outbreak in August 1996 that affected Saudi Arabia for the next three months. Officials used over [...] of pesticide in response to the outbreak. The heavy rural damage depressed the regional economy in 1996 and 1997.|$|E
500|$|Search {{and rescue}} teams {{operated}} across eastern Mexico, and initially they worked amid rainfall. The continuing rains {{and cut off}} communications disrupted relief efforts, as did the topography of the affected areas. In Puebla, the federal government donated 219mules and 81horses to assist in traveling to isolated areas. People used shovels and bare hands to remove mud and concrete in areas where they could not utilize machines. In Tulancingo, Hidalgo, people used rowboats to rescue stranded residents trapped by the flooding. Search and rescue missions ended on October15, after 7,112people were rescued from what the government described as [...] "high-risk situations." [...] To control the flooding, workers released water from dams and reservoirs. In Hidalgo, released water from a dam flooded two rivers and forced thousands of additional evacuations. In Tenango in Puebla, a dam developed a foot-long crack, which sparked evacuations and prompted workers to fill it with dirt and rocks. <b>Stagnant</b> <b>waters</b> raised fears for an outbreak of dengue fever; however, no flood-related epidemics occurred, and the waters were disinfected to prevent disease spread. By October22, there were only 21cases of dengue and 4cases of malaria, both fewer than normal. On October23, the Peñitas Dam was opened to maintain its integrity, causing downstream flooding. It was closed after water flow rates decreased. After the floods, some areas in Mexico faced water shortages. As a result, the National Water Commission initially distributed about 300,000litres of drinking water each day, and later increased it to 487,000litres per day, reaching 4million litres of distributed water by October19. Water service was gradually repaired, and by October19, 70 of the 90damaged water systems in Veracruz were restored. Equipment used for flood efforts were removed from duty after the floods receded.|$|E
