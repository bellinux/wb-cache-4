6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} and saw Hoopdriver. [...] "Damn!" [...] said the other man in brown, quite audibly, starting as he followed her glance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right, {{and beautifully}} written. Please add that I send my love to John," [...] said Mrs. March, as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> {{the letter and}} gave it back.|$|E
60|$|Jean {{laughed and}} went on; {{but her eyes}} gleamed with sudden malice, and <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} with an expression which boded ill for the faithful old servant.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> was <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> {{a letter}} that she had just opened, and at his words looked up with misgiving.|$|R
60|$|The dame de compagnie had {{advanced}} to the open hall-door. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> rapidly <b>over</b> her shoulder at Miss Haldin, who remained within the hall.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> {{once more}} <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} toward the village--perhaps beyond.|$|R
6000|$|The painter {{had been}} gone only {{a day or two}} when, while sitting upstairs alone one morning, <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the London paper just arrived, and read the {{following}} paragraph:- ...|$|E
60|$|Forgetful {{that she}} had on only thin shoes, and no {{covering}} over her head or shoulders, Mrs. Basswood ran directly down to the big sleigh. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the occupants and her eyes fastened instantly on Dave.|$|E
60|$|Manuel kindled at once, and Pauline smiled stealthily as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} from {{the threshold of}} the dancing hall, for her slightest act, look, and word had their part to play in that night's drama.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aren't you tired?" [...] <b>she</b> asked, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} and turning towards him a little pink ear, a fluffy golden curl, and one blue eye twinkling from the very corner of its lid.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Sally {{took the}} {{articles}} without a tremor, or the least deepening or paling of the delicate, faint suffusion of her cheek. When <b>she</b> had <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the letter, {{which appeared to}} be brief, she said, with smiling, half-pitying tranquillity:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma," [...] <b>she</b> began, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> {{the upper}} layer, [...] "I had {{forgotten}} these things. Why didn't {{you remind me}} of them? Do see about getting them sold. You will not mind about parting with them. You gave them all to me long ago." ...|$|R
60|$|Thankful {{that they}} were not {{inspired}} by Venus's little boy, <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> them, and saw they were in his best style, simple and pretty thoughts on the child's content, wherever he traced any symbol of his father.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, you don't. You look almost {{perfectly}} fresh. I {{like that}} fur cap IMMENSELY!' <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> Ursula, {{who wore a}} big soft coat with a collar of deep, soft, blond fur, and a soft blond cap of fur.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw the}} letter into her lap. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> it, {{and handed it}} to Mary. Mary perused it in silence, and {{returned}} it to her brother. All three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile enough.|$|E
60|$|She was {{introduced}} at Carl, <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> him <b>over,</b> and passed him on to Olive Dunleavy, all in forty-five seconds. When Carl had {{recovered from a}} sensation of being a kitten drowned in a sack, he said agreeable things to Olive, and observed {{the situation in the}} drawing-room.|$|R
6000|$|She {{opened it}} and read attentively, while Master Willie glanced round the parlour and took mental notes. Miss Emma Ward {{sat down on a}} stool in the window, ostensibly to [...] "do sums," [...] but really to draw faces, all of which bore a strong caricatured {{resemblance}} to Willie, at whom <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> slyly <b>over</b> the top of her slate.|$|R
60|$|After dinner, {{he retired}} into the parlour, {{continuing}} {{in the same}} state of abstraction, which was a burden intolerable to her. Then {{he went to the}} book-shelf and took down books to look at, that <b>she</b> had scarcely <b>glanced</b> <b>over.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{ought to}} satisfy me. But they don't. I suppose I'm ambitious. We both are. And we hadn't {{much of a}} springboard." [...] <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} at the cramped little garden with an air of reference in her gesture.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{right and}} proper of him. It {{is the only}} thing he can do. I suppose it would be the making of one of you. Ah!" [...] as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the letter. [...] "He gives the {{preference}} to you." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently {{we were at}} the piano, and Beatrice {{was playing}} with noisy inaccuracy. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} and Lady Osprey had resumed her patience. The old lady was very pink, and appeared to be absorbed in some attempt to cheat herself without our observing it.|$|E
60|$|Laura was in {{the room}} below. A servant brought in some letters, and <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> them <b>over.</b> One was the note from herself to Maumbry, informing him that she was unable to endure life with him any longer and was about to elope with Vannicock. Having read the letter she took it upstairs to where the dead man was, and slipped it into his coffin. The next day she buried him.|$|R
6000|$|At length Don Ambrosio, {{to give an}} effectual blow to her confidence, {{brought her}} the {{proclamation}} of the approaching auto da f√©, in which the prisoners were enumerated. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> her eye <b>over</b> it, and beheld her father's name, condemned to the stake for sorcery! ...|$|R
60|$|She {{drew her}} {{mantilla}} across her shoulders {{with an expression}} of shocked sensitiveness which completed the humiliation of Brace and the subjugation of Don Ramon. But, unlike most of her sex, she was wise in the moment of victory. <b>She</b> cast a <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> her fan at Brace, and turned languidly to Dona Isabel.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Snowdon {{remained}} {{silent for a}} moment, with brows knit in deep thought, while Annon uneasily watched her. Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder, drew nearer, and whispered cautiously, [...] "Did the rumors of which you speak charge him with--" [...] and the last word was breathed into Annon's ear almost inaudibily.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} and found him nearer than she thought, started, gesticulated, gave a little cry that pierced me to the heart, and fled up the beach obliquely toward me, running like the wind, and passed me, vanished amidst the black distorted bushes, and was gone--she and her pursuer, in a moment, over the ridge of sand.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked for}} a moment like a wild animal caged in a civilized dwelling-place. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the walls covered with books, as if for a second she had {{forgotten}} {{the position of the}} door. Then she made as if to go, but her father laid his hand upon her shoulder. He compelled her to sit down.|$|E
60|$|Her {{face grew}} stony, a dry glitter {{came to her}} blue eyes; <b>she</b> cast a <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} at Diana and her servant. Wilding observed it and read what was passing in her mind; indeed, {{it was not to}} be mistaken, no more than what is passing in the mind of the recruit who looks behind him in the act of charging. His lips half smiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{only came}} this evening. I have not opened it yet. To tell the truth, I {{have been so}} {{interested}} in your story that I had forgotten all about it. Poor old Hector! It is from Madeira." [...] <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> rapidly <b>over</b> the four pages of straggling writing in the young sailor's bold schoolboyish hand. [...] "Oh, he is all right," [...] she said. [...] "They had a gale on the way out, {{and that sort of}} thing, but he is all right now. He thinks he may be back by March. I wonder whether your new friend will come to-morrow--your knight of the enchanted Castle." ...|$|R
60|$|One summer afternoon, {{many years}} ago--but I {{know the exact}} date: July 1st, 1897--I was {{drinking}} tea on the lawn of a house at Kew, when the maid brought the letters out to her mistress, and she, Mrs. E. Hubbard, looking over the pile remarked that she saw the Selborne Magazine had come and <b>she</b> would just <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> it {{to see if it}} contained anything to interest both of us.|$|R
60|$|The pause lengthened. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} down the vacant avenue. This interview--this momentous series of things unsaid {{was coming to}} an end! She looked at him hesitatingly and smiled again. She held out her hand. No doubt that was the proper thing to do. He took it, searching a void, tumultuous mind in vain.|$|E
60|$|She {{put back}} her head, seeing a typewritten letter, anticipating trouble {{from the outside}} world. There was the curious, sliding motion of her eyes, as if she shut off her sentient, {{maternal}} self, {{and a kind of}} hard trance, meaningless, took its place. Thus, meaningless, <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the letter, careful not to take it in. She apprehended the contents with her callous, superficial mind. Her feeling self was shut down.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't wish to dirty my clean frock," [...] said Poppy faintly, as <b>she</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the wide-ploughed field, and {{longed for}} a bit of grass to drop on. She kept on bravely for another turn; but {{suddenly}} stopped, and, quite regardless of the clean pink gown, dropped down in a furrow, looking so white and queer that Nelly began to cry. Poppy lay a minute, then turned to Cy, and said very solemnly: ...|$|E
60|$|Early in {{the service}} Mrs. Flushing had {{discovered}} that she had taken up a Bible instead of a prayer-book, and, as she {{was sitting next to}} Hirst, <b>she</b> stole a <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder. He was reading steadily in the thin pale-blue volume. Unable to understand, she peered closer, upon which Hirst politely laid the book before her, pointing to the first line of a Greek poem and then to the translation opposite.|$|R
60|$|Gabriel's {{features}} adhered {{throughout their}} form so exactly {{to the middle}} line between the beauty of St. John and the ugliness of Judas Iscariot, as represented in a window of the church he attended, that not a single lineament could be selected and called worthy either of distinction or notoriety. The red-jacketed and dark-haired maiden seemed to think so too, for <b>she</b> carelessly <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> him, and told her man to drive on. She might have looked her thanks to Gabriel on a minute scale, {{but she did not}} speak them; more probably she felt none, for in gaining her a passage he had lost her her point, and we know how women take a favour of that kind.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{difficult}} to say whether he was more absurd than cruel or more cruel than absurd. Mrs Fyne, with the fine ear of a woman, seemed to detect a jeering intention in his meanly unctuous tone, something more vile than mere cruelty. <b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> quickly <b>over</b> her shoulder and saw the girl raise her two hands to her head, then let them fall again on her lap. Fyne {{in front of the}} fire was like the victim of an unholy spell--bereft of motion and speech but obviously in pain. It was a short pause of perfect silence, and then that [...] "odious creature" [...] (he must have been really a remarkable individual in his way) struck out into sarcasm.|$|R
