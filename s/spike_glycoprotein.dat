50|$|The {{non-structural}} proteins (nsP) play different {{functions in}} the virus cycle. The non-structural protein 1 (nsP1) is an mRNA-capping enzyme, nsP2 has protease activity, nsP4 is a RNA-direct RNA polymerase. The structural polyprotein is cleaved into 6 chains: Capsid protein (C), p62, E3 protein or <b>spike</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> E3, E2 envelope glycoprotein or <b>spike</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> E2, 6K protein, E1 envelope glycoprotein known also as <b>spike</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> E1. The envelope lipid component is critical for virus particle stability and infectivity in mammalian cells Once the virus enters into the host cell, the genomic RNA is released into the cytoplasm, where the two ORFs are translated into proteins and the synthesis of negative-strand RNA starts. A consecutive synthesis of positive-strand RNA takes place.|$|E

50|$|TGEV infects pigs. However, {{in young}} pigs, the {{mortality}} rate is close to 100%. The pathology of TGEV {{is similar to that}} of other coronaviruses. Coronaviruses enter the host by first attaching to the host cell using the <b>spike</b> <b>glycoprotein.</b> The S protein interacts with the porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), a cellular receptor, to aide in its entry. The same cell receptor is also a point of contact for Human Coronaviruses. A domain in the S spike protein is recognized by pAPN, and transfection of pAPN occurs to nonpermissive cells and infects them with TGEV. Once the virus infects the host, it multiplies in the cell lining of the small intestine resulting in the loss of absorptive cells that in turn leads to shortening of villi. The infected swine then has reduced capability for digesting food and die from dehydration.|$|E

Although the fraction of the 2014 <b>spike</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> mutations is very small (~ 3 %), the mortality is significantly reduced, while the transmission appears to have increased strongly. Bioinformatic scaling had previously shown similar inversely correlated trends in virulence and transmission in N 1 (H 1 N 1) and N 2 (H 3 N 2) influenza <b>spike</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> mutations. These trends appear to be related to various external factors (migration, availability of pure water, and vaccination programs).

40|$|The {{acylation}} of the haemagglutinin (HA) {{of different}} influenza viruses {{and of the}} envelope glycoproteins of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) were analysed. The fatty acid linkage in these acylproteins {{was found to be}} resistant to a variety of organic solvents and combinations of these, even after pretreatment with various detergents. Fatty acids are released from influenza virus HA at a pH value between 11. 8 and 12. 1 at room temperature. Although this mild alkaline cleavage occurs rapidly, the release of fatty acids by treatment with hydroxylamine is time-, temperature- and concentration-dependent. By comparison with model esters the linkage in HA is suggested tobe of the oxygenester type rather than a thioester linkage. To assay for possible functions of protein-bound fatty acids the biological activities of influenza virus (A/FPV/ Rostock/ 34) and its solubilized <b>spike</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> were measured after deacylation. While viral haemagglutination activity was not hampered at all, its ability to haemolyse erythrocytes and infectivity were drastically reduced. Likewise, viral spike glycopro-reins solubilized with detergents failed to induce haemolysis at low pH when fatty acids had been cleaved off.

The fusion reaction is critical for the infectious cycle, catalyzing virus penetration from the acidic endosome compartment. To define {{the role of the}} viral <b>spike</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> in the fusion reaction, conformational changes in the spikes at acid pH were studied using protease digestion and binding assays to liposomes and nonionic detergent. A method was also developed to prepare fragments of both transmembrane subunit glycopolypeptides of the spike, E 1 and E 2, which lacked the hydrophobic anchor peptides. Unlike the intact spikes the fragments were monomeric and therefore useful for obtaining information on conformational changes in individual subunits. The results showed that both E 1 and E 2 undergo irreversible conformational changes at the pH of fusion, that the conformational change of E 1 depends, in addition to acidic pH, on the presence of cholesterol, and that no major changes in the solubility properties of the spikes takes place. On the basis of these findings it was concluded that fusion involves both subunits of the spike and that E 1 confers the stereo-specific sterol requirement.

40|$|AbstractThe mouse {{hepatitis}} virus (MHV) <b>spike</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> mediates attachment of {{the virus}} to the MHV receptor, the murine biliary glycoprotein (BGP) carcinoembryonic antigen. Monoclonal antibody CC 1 directed against BGP specifically inhibited infection of DBT, Sac-, GT 1 - 7, and OBL 21 cells by wild-type MHV- 4 and the neuron-adapted variant OBLV 60. Binding to this receptor was necessary to establish infection by cell-free MHV; however, the presence of BGP was not required for infection by cell-associated virus. Cell-associated infection induced syncytium formation on Vero and BHK cells, which lack murine BGP; this activity was not inhibited by monoclonal antibody CC 1. Antibody CC 1 also did not prevent syncytium formation on DBT cells, which bear BGP. In infectious center assays, the MHV- 4 variant OBLV 60, which exhibits acid-dependent fusion, spread to cells lacking BGP only when exposed to acidic media. Therefore, spike-mediated fusion was required for BGP-independent spread of MHV infection. Furthermore, BGP-independent, cell-associated spread of MHV- 4 was prevented by monoclonal antibodies 5 A 13. 5 and 5 B 19. 2 directed against the <b>spike</b> <b>glycoprotein,</b> but not by other neutralizing and nonneutralizing anti-spike antibodies.

The molecular mechanisms that govern enhanced susceptibility of elderly populations are not known, and robust animal models are needed that recapitulate the increased pathogenic phenotype noted with increasing age. Using synthetic biology and reverse genetics, we describe the construction of a panel of isogenic SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strains bearing variant <b>spike</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> that are representative of zoonotic strains found in palm civets and raccoon dogs, as well as isolates spanning the early, middle, and late phases of the SARS-CoV epidemic. The recombinant viruses replicated efficiently in cell culture and demonstrated variable sensitivities to neutralization with antibodies. The human but not the zoonotic variants replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cultures, supporting earlier hypotheses that zoonotic isolates are less pathogenic in humans but can evolve into highly pathogenic strains. All viruses replicated efficiently, but none produced clinical disease or death in young animals. In contrast, severe clinical disease, diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, alveolitis, and death were noted in 12 -month-old mice inoculated with the palm civet HC/SZ/ 61 / 03 strain or early-human-phase GZ 02 variants but not with related middle- and late-phase epidemic or raccoon dog strains. This panel of SARS-CoV recombinants bearing zoonotic and human epidemic <b>spike</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> will provide heterologous challenge models for testing vaccine efficacy against zoonotic reintroductions as well as provide the appropriate model system for elucidating the complex virus-host interactions that contribute to more-severe and fatal SARS-CoV disease and acute respiratory distress in the elderly...|$|R

Overexpression of GP also results in the masking of certain antigenic epitopes on GP itself, causing an illusory effect of disappearance from the plasma membrane.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of the surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses to mediate virus/cell binding and membrane fusion requires a proper thiol/disulfide balance. Chemical manipulation of their redox state using reducing agents or free sulfhydryl reagents affects virus/cell interaction. Conversely, natural thiol/disulfide rearrangements often occur during the cell interaction to trigger fusogenicity, hence the virus entry. We {{examined the relationship between}} the redox state of the 20 cysteine residues of the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) <b>Spike</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> S 1 subdomain and its functional properties. Mature S 1 exhibited approximately 4 unpaired cysteines, and chemically reduced S 1 displaying up to approximately 6 additional unpaired cysteines still bound ACE 2 and enabled fusion. In addition, virus/cell membrane fusion occurred in the presence of sulfhydryl-blocking reagents and oxidoreductase inhibitors. Thus, in contrast to various viruses including HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) examined in parallel, the functions of the SARS-CoV <b>Spike</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> exhibit a significant and surprising independence of redox state, which may contribute to the wide host range of the virus.

The liposome binding assay shows that interaction of the receptor with spikes on virions at 37 °C causes a conformational change that makes the virions hydrophobic so that they bind to liposomes (B. D. Zelus, J. H. Schickli, D. M. Blau, S. R. Weiss, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 77 : 830 - 840, 2003). Recombinant viruses with spikes containing the RBD of either MHV-A 59 or MHV- 4 readily associated with liposomes at 37 °C in the presence of soluble mCEACAM 1 a, except for S 4 R, which expresses the entire wild-type MHV- 4 spike and associated only inefficiently with liposomes following incubation with soluble mCEACAM 1 a. In contrast, soluble mCEACAM 1 b allowed viruses with the MHV-A 59 RBD to associate with liposomes more efficiently than did viruses with the MHV- 4 RBD. In the second assay, which requires virus entry and replication, all recombinant viruses replicated efficiently in BHK cells expressing mCEACAM 1 a. In BHK cells expressing mCEACAM 1 b, only viruses expressing chimeric spikes with the MHV-A 59 RBD could replicate, while replication of viruses expressing chimeric spikes with the MHV- 4 RBD was undetectable. Despite having the MHV- 4 RBD, S 4 R replicated in BHK cells expressing mCEACAM 1 b; this is most probably due to spread via CEACAM 1 receptor-independent cell-to-cell fusion, an activity displayed only by S 4 R among the recombinant viruses studied here.
