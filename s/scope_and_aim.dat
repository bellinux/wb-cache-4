40|$|It is {{inevitable}} {{that as a}} result of progress in technology and the changes in the ways with which design is conceived, interior architecture schools should be updated according to these requirements and that new educational processes should be tried out. It is for this reason that the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>aim</b> of this study have been determined as being the formulation of a hybrid educational model for the integration of digital approaches to design within the interior architecture education system. Within the chosen <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>aim</b> of this study, and as a methodology, various algorithmic and parametric approaches have been applied in various practical applications as digital design instruments, and conclusions have been reached concerning the advantages they offer within the design process. The advantages and disadvantages, concerning interior architecture education, of digital approaches to design over the traditional design method, have been presented on the basis of results found during practical applications of digital design, the information found in publications about this subject. A hybrid educational model for the restructuring with digital design instruments of interior architecture education and design studios as experimental areas has been presented. Thanks to this proposed model, the establishment of a computer formatted analytic design system in the guise of dynamic systems will get easier and, the opportunity of restructuring the process and conception of design will also present itself. As the effects of this method are reflected on the products, new geometric approaches and typologies will appear, with the result that designs and digital instruments will constantly be developed and will evolve. In conclusion, educating the designers of the future according to the essence of these approaches will make it possible to train professionals who correctly use and understand the technologies being developed, who have a critical stance, and who can produce renewable designs...|$|E

Such an approach is targeted at confronting the obsolescence of urban areas and sustaining the “urban change”, and through city recycling, also improving the city’s environmental, social, economic sustainability, to provide more urban quality to urban communities and, at the same time support the local economy in the short and long-term, to help overcome the effects of the current down-turn.

40|$|Recent {{reviews of}} the {{state-of-the-art}} of ecological modeling for risk assessments have highlighted the need for standardization of modeling approaches (Pastorok et al. 2003; Grimm et al. 2009). Such standardization requires concerted actions with all stakeholders involved in the regulatory process. Therefore, a new SETAC-Europe Advisory Group on “Mechanistic effect models for ecological risk assessment of chemicals” (MEMoRisk) was established in autumn 2008. During the SETAC-Europe Annual Meeting in Warsaw in May 2008, 21 people joined the founding meeting where the necessity, <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>aim</b> of such a group were discussed. A founding steering committee (the authors of this paper) was selected to prepare a proposal and to bring the advisory group into life. The overall aim of the advisory group is to explore and evaluate the benefit of mechanistic effect modeling for the risk assessment of chemicals in Europe and elsewhere as appropriate. This will be done by establishing a forum for better communication and cooperation of scientists in academia, industry and government working on or with mechanistic modeling to analyze and predict effects of chemicals on organisms, populations and communities...|$|E
40|$|To re-establish regular {{operations}} in a tram traffic network after a large disturbance, e. g. resulting from vehicle breakdown or station closure, {{the viability of}} several rescheduling and rerouting strategies has to be evaluated prior to their implementation. Here, a multi-modal traffic simulation system can help to enhance the decision quality. Such a system obviously faces tight time constraints, so simulation data has to be acquired fast. In this {{paper we propose a}} method for the parallel execution of discrete traffic simulation models, which would accelerate data generation in comparison to a sequential model. To assess this method's dynamic behavior in real-world applications, some experiments conducted on a software system modeling schedule based tram traffic are presented.

It resulted in change of <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>aim</b> of finance audit, the broadening of auditors’ competencies and other people connected with audit tasks. The regulations of amended act lead to the connection of finance audit with other specialized state authorities. Finance audit authorities gained as well the possibility of getting information being banking secret and information about taxpayers thanks to the access to finance intelligence. Further numerous changes of this law were introduced by passing other bills, which were closely or in a certain extent connected with finance audit aims. Originally the act was premature legislative product, which not only didn’t fulfil legislative organs’ requirements but also didn’t take its roots positively in the practice of financial transactions.

40|$|The recent {{popularity}} of digital information sharing through networking requires {{new technologies to}} protect intellectual property rights or digital copyrights. The concept of digital rights management (DRM) has been introduced in this arena. DRM is largely focused on payment-based controls for digital information dissemination and its use. The principal motivation is generation and protection of revenue derived from digital content. Usage control (UCON) is a more general concept also encompassing payment-free dissemination controls motivated by confidentiality and privacy concerns. UCON unifies traditional access control policies with payment-based policies. In this paper we outline an engineering framework for UCON based on the four layered OM-AM approach, comprising objective, model, architecture and mechanism layers. Each layer has its distinct <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>aim.</b> We identify some of major factors that comprise UCON objectives.

Based on the studies of two anti-trafficking projects, one in the Russian Federation and the other in the Federal Republic of Germany, which were managed by the IOM, I will show how the organisation, as a provider of expertise, shapes the regimes of practice to combat human trafficking and thus the reality, of human trafficking in both countries. In it's projects IOM needs to cooperate with national governments that partly determines their <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>aims,</b> <b>and</b> this has led to a conceptualisation of migration more in terms of the needs of nations than those of migrants. The IOM`s method of migration management is geared towards the needs of the nation-state: eliminating illegal migration and encouraging the migration of skilled labour.
