25|$|By 1936 he {{was almost}} entirely {{painting}} on wood such a flat application of oil paint that even artists {{asked him if he}} painted in tempera. He had painted on canvas but with the painting of his plant subjects he felt closer to the earth if he worked on wood. One medium that he used and was very skilled was painting in oil on rice pith. This is very thin, like tissue paper although not paper at all but rather the pith of the rice plant cut under water by the Japanese. So deft was his use of oil on this transparent, lighter than air substance that there were often accusations that it surely could not be done with oil.

During the 1980s, plans for the Second Avenue line stagnated. Construction on the 63rd Street Lines continued; the IND portion of the line opened in 1989 and {{extended}} to 21st Street–Queensbridge in Long Island City, Queens, but it did not include a connection to the Second Avenue line. Of this failure to complete construction, Gene Russianoff, an advocate for subway riders since 1981, stated: [...] "It's the most famous thing that's never been built in New York City, <b>so</b> <b>everyone</b> is skeptical and rightly so.

500|$|However, the 1975–1976 fiscal crisis, {{combined}} with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs, led to the MTA and the city having no funds to complete the Second Avenue Line.

She further sings throughout the song, [...] "The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leaved that I made a difference". Watery synths shimmer in the background before Beyoncé adopts an authoritative tone to chant the chorus lines: [...] "I was here / I lived, I loved / I was here / I did, I've done / Everything that I wanted / And it was more than I thought it would be / I will leave my mark <b>so</b> <b>everyone</b> will know / I was here".|$|E

For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. The Dio Years was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the Billboard 200, while the single [...] "The Devil Cried" [...] reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the Mob Rules era line-up for a world tour. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. When asked about {{the name of the}} group, Iommi stated [...] "it really is Black Sabbath, whatever we do... <b>so</b> <b>everyone</b> knows what they're getting [...] so people won't expect to hear 'Iron Man' and all those songs.

500|$|Howard {{originally}} envisioned Maximus as the [...] "ultimate super-cop", jokingly {{referring to}} the character as [...] "the Tommy Lee Jones of horses". Attempting to make Maximus feel like a [...] "fresh" [...] character, the filmmakers researched several historical horses from both animated and live-action films {{to ensure that the}} character would be unique and different enough from his predecessors. Greno explained that [...] "Maximus ... could have easily slipped into the category of, 'Oh, I've seen that before.'" [...] To prevent this, the filmmakers referenced [...] "a board with photos of all the different animated horses that had been done". Howard explained that Maximus was originally conceived as a [...] "pretty serious" [...] character, but eventually developed into a funnier and more likeable horse as the animators continued to draw him with dog-like attributes. Both Pascal and Maximus, who according to the Austin American-Statesman are responsible for providing the film with the majority of its comic relief, were eventually written into the film by screenwriter Dan Fogelman. Analyzing the characters' roles in the film, HitFix observed that [...] "There's a simplicity to it all that I admire, and you throw in a few anthropomorphized animals <b>so</b> <b>everyone</b> laughs a lot, and that's the Disney recipe".

500|$|Jaws was {{the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, {{resulting}} in a troubled shoot that went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget [...] "was $4million and the picture wound up costing $9million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname [...] "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; [...] "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," [...] he said. As for his lack of experience: [...] "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." [...] Gottlieb said that [...] "there was nothing to do except make the movie", <b>so</b> <b>everyone</b> kept overworking, and while as a writer {{he did not have to}} attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived [...] "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".|$|E

Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, [...] "This has been the easiest post process we've ever had on a film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, the tricky thing is the effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards. <b>So</b> <b>everyone</b> starts killing themselves at this point...we'll be done with the movie in two and a half months."
