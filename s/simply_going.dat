5|$|The British {{relief of}} Kimberley and Ladysmith in February 1900 marked the turning {{of the war}} against the Boers. Morale {{plummeted}} among the commandos over the following months, with many burghers <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> home; Kruger toured the front in response and asserted that any man who deserted in this time of need should be shot. He had hoped for large numbers of Cape Afrikaners to rally to the republican cause, but only small bands did so, along with a few thousand foreign volunteers (principally Dutchmen, Germans and Scandinavians). When British troops entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900 Reitz and others urged Kruger to destroy the gold mines, but he refused on the grounds that this would obstruct rehabilitation after the war. Mafeking was relieved two months later and on 30 May Lord Roberts took Johannesburg. Kruger left Pretoria on 29 May, travelling by train to Machadodorp, and on 2 June the government abandoned the capital. Roberts entered three days later.|$|E

There an attempt was made to seat an international tribunal, but the Turks bungled the investigations and mishandled the documentary evidence so that nothing of their work could be used by the international court.|$|E

25|$|The {{two teams}} were meeting after a gap {{of less than}} six months. These back to back Ashes series were being staged after 38 years, {{reminiscent}} of the 1970s. The move was initiated keeping in mind the 2015 World Cup that Australia and New Zealand were to host. The previous edition of the Ashes was played in England in July 2013 with England emerging comfortable winners. England had won the previous three editions of the Ashes and were tipped to win this edition as well. They were looking to emulate a feat {{that had not been}} achieved since the 1890s, win four Ashes on the trot. <b>Simply</b> <b>going</b> by Australia's performances in the recent past, it was assumed that the result was a foregone conclusion. Australia's batting was clearly found wanting in the previous series and they had lost matches from seemingly comfortable situations, as was seen in Durham and Lord's. The series had was also shadowed by the controversy surrounding Stuart Broad's refusal to walk in the previous series after clearly edging Ashton Agar to Michael Clarke in the first test at Trent Bridge. He was dubbed a 'smug pommie cheat' by sections of the media and with coach Darren Lehman's unsavory comments, things were even more interesting.|$|E
500|$|Titanic Ventures Inc., a Connecticut-based consortium, co-sponsored {{a survey}} and salvage {{operation}} in 1987 with the French oceanographic agency IFREMER. The expedition produced an outcry, {{not least because}} of the damage that it caused to the wreck. When the crow's nest bell was pulled from the mast, the crow's nest itself, where the lookouts first saw the iceberg, collapsed. A Titanic survivor, Eva Hart, was outspoken in her condemnation of what many saw as the looting of a mass grave: [...] "To bring up those things from a mass sea grave just {{to make a few}} thousand pounds shows a dreadful insensitivity and greed.

That was, however, until he visited Berlin, which influenced the album's lush sound. Wainwright declared, [...] "Basically, a huge wave of German Romanticism descended on the recording process, and almost drowned me." [...] Wainwright cited two reasons for the change in direction and the heightened dramatic flare: the cancer diagnosis received by his mother (folk musician Kate McGarrigle) during the album's genesis, which he found [...] "fueled his creative intensity {{in some kind of}} displaced attempt to get her well", and the New York Metropolitan Opera's commissioning Wainwright to write an opera, making Release the Stars a way of training for such a large project. Revealing the overall theme in January 2007, Wainwright declared the album was about opening up and following impulses. [...] "Whether it's the environment, politics or religious warfare", Wainwright stated in an interview with The Japan Times, [...] "it's time {{to get out there and}} be a part of the solution, whatever that is." ...|$|E

500|$|Eventually {{credited}} with victories over twelve enemy aircraft, plus two probables and eight damaged, Barr became No.3 Squadron's highest-scoring member. He flew {{a total of}} eighty-four combat sorties, twenty of them in one fortnight, and six on 16June 1942 alone. His philosophy was that the P-40 was not a top-class fighter, but that its shortcomings [...] "could be offset by unbridled aggression", so he resolved to treat aerial combat as he would a boxing match and [...] "overcome much better opponents by <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> for them". Bobby Gibbes became No.3 Squadron's commanding officer in February 1942, and made Barr his senior flight commander. Promoted to flight lieutenant on 1April, Barr was raised to acting squadron leader and appointed to command the unit in May, barely six months after he commenced operations, following Gibbes's hospitalisation with a broken ankle. Barr had never sought leadership of the squadron, and felt that others were just as well qualified for the role. As a commander he delegated most administrative tasks to his adjutant but, contrary to normal practice, wrote letters to the next-of-kin of casualties himself.|$|E

For his part, Nash king-hit Carlton captain Bob Chitty in the final quarter with what he later {{described}} as the sweetest punch he had ever thrown, knocking Chitty out, breaking his jaw and leaving a large wound over his left eye which required several stitches; as the umpire was unsighted, Nash went unreported over this incident.

500|$|Dwarves {{need to be}} {{provided}} with food and drink (mostly {{in the form of}} alcohol). A dwarf will get negative thoughts for drinking plain water and even for drinking the same type of alcohol, making it necessary to grow different crops for producing different drinks. Things like not having a separate bedroom can upset a dwarf. They may make friends and sometimes marry; females give birth. Dwarves can get upset by sustaining injuries, having poor clothing, losing their pets, friends or relatives; interacting with or seeing their corpses can aggravate this. A frustrated dwarf may break furniture or attack others. Continuous stress will cause them to throw tantrums and eventually go insane, whether going [...] and attacking their comrades in a homicidal rage, becoming suicidally depressed and jumping off a cliff, or <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> [...] "stark raving mad" [...] and stumbling around randomly until their untimely death. Their quality of life can be improved by giving them luxurious personal bedrooms and a well-decorated dining room, medical care, and providing them with a variety of drinks and well-cooked meals. A chain reaction where a single dwarf's unhappiness causes the entire fortress's population to start throwing tantrums can begin when one dwarf throws a tantrum, attacks and kills another one with many friends, which drastically affects the happiness of many more.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} aspects of the series that critics point out, either {{positively}} or negatively, is that the series [...] "never strays from its classic roots." [...] Unlike other modern, complex RPGs, Dragon Quest on the DS retains the simple gameplay from the first game that many critics find refreshing and nostalgic. Points of contention are its battle system, comparatively simplistic storylines, general lack of character development, simplistic primitive-looking graphics (in earlier titles), and the overall difficulty of the game. These arguments are countered by noting its strength in episodic storytelling with the various non-player characters the party meets. The stories avoid melodrama and feature relatively more simplistic characters than Final Fantasys Squall Leonhart or Tidus, a source of contention. There are exceptions, however, such as Dragon Quest V, which has been praised for its unique, emotional storytelling. Battles are also simple and finish quickly. As for difficulty, Yuji Horii is noted as a gambler. The lack of save points and the general difficulty of the battles were included {{with the intention of}} adding a sense of tension. Because of this added difficulty, the punishment for the party's death was toned down compared to other games by <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> back to where you had last saved, with half of your gold on hand. When asked about criticism of Dragon Quest games, Horii says he does not mind, it means the critics played the game and he would rather know their concerns than remain ignorant.|$|E

2500|$|Craven {{chose to}} give Iliadis his freedom while filming the remake, {{partially}} because Craven {{was in the}} process of working on a new film for himself, but also because he likes to allow the directors the chance to make their own film. For the 2009 remake, Iliadis wanted to keep a consistency among the scenes of his film, as compared to the 1972 original. Iliadis stated that he felt the intercutting of comedic scenes with the rape scene in the 1972 film had the tendency to take one out of the moment. Iliadis wanted to [...] "cut those diversions out", as a way of [...] " [...] into this scene with no place to cut away to". For Iliadis, taking this approach helped to create more drama for the event. The producers brought in a medical technician to provide insight, based on his job experience witnessing the people's deaths, and lend realism to the actors' portrayals. Lindhome states that the technician would explain how someone would react given a particular event, like getting shot or stabbed. Iliadis also felt that his work on Hardcore helped to train him for this film. As the director points out, Hardcore contained [...] "very difficult scenes", like a sixteen-year-old girl having an [...] "existential breakdown during an orgy", and Iliadis sees those scenes as training for him to learn how to make sure the actors are still being respected, as well as making sure that the scene is focused on the characters instead of <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> for [...] "titillation".|$|E
2500|$|Davey Wreden, 22 {{years old}} at the time of the modification's release, was {{inspired}} to create The Stanley Parable about three years prior, after considering the typical storytelling narratives within video games, and thought of what would happen if the player would go against that narration; Wreden also saw this as a means towards his planned career as a game developer. As a video game player, Wreden has found that most major triple-A titles at the time make numerous assumptions about the player's experience and fitting that within the game, and don't provide answers for [...] "what if" [...] questions that the player may consider. Wreden considered that more recent games with more engaging or thought-provoking stories, including the Metal Gear Solid series, Half-Life 2, Portal, Braid, and BioShock, started to approach this void, giving reason for the player to stop and think about the narration instead of <b>simply</b> <b>going</b> through the motions. Though his initial intent was a personal project simply to try to make such a game that asked the questions about why people play video games, he found that there were other gamers that had been considering the same type of questions. He then set out to make a game that would be the subject of discussion for players after they completed it. According to Wreden, his design document for the game was [...] "Mess with the player's head in every way possible, throwing them off-guard, or pretending there's an answer and then kinda whisking it away from in front of them." ...|$|E
