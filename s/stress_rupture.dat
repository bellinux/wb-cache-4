Because this failure mode {{is a function of}} time and sustained load, composite overwrapped {{pressure vessels}} (COPVs) launch vehicles and spacecraft are particularly susceptible because missions can be of long duration and the operating loads on the composite overwrap are typically high. Mitigation of this failure mode requires appropriate characterization of this <b>stress</b> <b>rupture</b> lifetime.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} amount of carbon and diffusible hydrogen, {{high-strength}} wear-resistant steel NM 360, which is widely used on excavating machinery, always tends to develop cold crack after welding. Heat affected zone (HAZ) is the weakest part in a welding joint and is the most probable location for the generation of welding cold crack. In this paper, the effects of preheating temperature and heat input on welding cold crack sensitivity of NM 360 steel have been studied by using implant tests. It is found that the preheating temperature and interlayer temperature during CO 2 arc welding of NM 360 steel should be 100 °C or 125 °C {{to prevent the occurrence}} of welding cold crack.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{assessment of}} creep rupture limit {{is an important}} issue for industrial components under combined action of cyclic thermal and mechanical loading. This paper proposes a new creep rupture assessment method under the Linear Matching Method framework, where the creep rupture limit is evaluated through an extended shakedown analysis using the revised yield stress, which is determined by the minimum of the yield stress of the material and the individual creep <b>rupture</b> <b>stress</b> at each integration point. Various numerical strategies have been investigated to calculate these creep <b>rupture</b> <b>stresses</b> associated with given temperatures and allowable creep rupture time. Three distinct methods: a) linear interpolation method, b) logarithm based polynomial relationship and c) the Larson–Miller parameter, are introduced to interpolate and extrapolate an accurate creep <b>rupture</b> <b>stress,</b> on the basis of discrete experimental creep rupture data. Comparisons between these methods are carried out to determine the most appropriate approach leading to the accurate solution to the creep <b>rupture</b> <b>stresses</b> for the creep rupture analysis.
