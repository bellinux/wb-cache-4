Also, the aroma of bean is weaker with poor elasticity. After adding sodium alginate, the increase of <b>soybean</b> <b>curd</b> is minor, but the aroma of bean is weaker and some colloids appear, as well as the elasticity is not enough, those are bad for the production control. Adding carrageenan can also increase <b>soybean</b> <b>curd</b> sharply, and makes the <b>soybean</b> <b>curd</b> block type more complete with soft and fine taste, but the aroma of bean is weaker and the elasticity is just general.

However, the <b>soybean</b> <b>curd</b> yield dropped constantly when inoculation the amount was beyond 4.0 %. It is probably because too much lactic acid bacteria led to the competition for fermentation substrate between them, and thus affect their fermentation activity. In sensory evaluation of two strains, the block type was relatively complete, and it had a sense of particles as well as lack of fine texture, which meant soybean curd’s quality has not yet met the best in single strain fermentation.

30|$|From Figure  1 we can {{see that}} the {{difference}} of stains has little influence on <b>soybean</b> <b>curd</b> yield, but the yield decreased as soy milk concentration (the content of soluble solids) increased. Because the lactic acid bacteria produced lactic acid in the fermentation of soy milk, it reduced the pH of the soy milk solution which made the pH approach to the isoelectric point of the protein. That made the protein change its state from sol to gel, and the protein gel network contains water, so the <b>soybean</b> <b>curd</b> yield increased. However, the proportion of water in the <b>soybean</b> <b>curd</b> is much larger than the protein ratio, so as soy milk concentration increased, even though the increase in protein content, the quality of the water molecules is much smaller than the protein’s, thus {{the increase in the number}} of protein molecules was much less than the decrease in number of water molecules.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate the nutrient degradability, in vitro methane (CH 4) production ofseveral agricultural and food industry by-products in relation to their chemical composition. Twenty-onesamples of 7 feedstuffs from agricultural and food industry by-products consisted of corn straw, potatostraw, rice straw, cocoa pod, sago waste, rice bran, <b>soybean</b> <b>curd</b> residue were evaluated by an in vitro gasproduction and nutrient degradability. The feedstuffs varied greatly in their crude protein (CP), neutraldetergent fiber (NDF) and non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) contents. Crude protein ranged from 1. 5 to 21. 8 %,NDF from 31. 6 to 71. 1 % and NFC from 1. 5 to 50. 8 %. Among the seven feedstuffs, <b>soybean</b> <b>curd</b> residuehad the highest CP content, on the other hand it had the lowest NDF content. Dry matter (DM) and organicmatter (OM) degradability were highest (P< 0. 01) in <b>soybean</b> <b>curd</b> residue among the feedstuffs. The CH 4 production was significantly higher (P< 0. 01) in rice straw, cocoa pod and corn straw as compared to sagowaste. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0. 60; P< 0. 01) between NDF concentration and CH 4 production. However, the total gas productions was negatively correlated (r = - 0. 75; P< 0. 01) with NDFcontent. The CH 4 production of feedstuff is influenced by NDF content...|$|E

30|$|A 10 -kg fresh weight <b>soybean</b> <b>curd</b> residue (1.85  kg from Miyoshiya Tofu, Bibai, Japan, 2.45  kg, Mameta, Sapporo, Japan, 3.0  kg, Marukawa Foods, Sapporo, Japan, and 2.7  kg, At the Bran Made of Koyama, Sapporo, Japan) was {{collected}} from grocery shops and mixed for extraction with methanol (MeOH). The <b>soybean</b> <b>curd</b> residues were soaked in 10  L of MeOH, and the methanolic extract {{was collected}} by decantation and squeezing the remaining residues in a cotton cloth.
