[...] . 7 _________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACT: All the literature in repository planning says you should be really clear about the purposes and scope of your repository because that will drive the decisions about how you set it up (and other things too). However, it is really easy to be diverted/overwhelmed/inveigled into ending up with a repository that has quite different scope and purposes. This presentation will discuss the pressures, dilemmas and consequences involved in the above scenario, will use examples from my USQ ePrint experience, and suggest some solutions. I don’t pretend that I have universal answers, but our problems and our ways processes to resolve them may help some of you with similar issues. I also {{want to give a}} disclaimer that these are MY opinions, and not that of either USQ or my present or former ePrints colleagues...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s {{there was}} already a debate about whether the {{emergence}} of the modern phyla was [...] "explosive" [...] or gradual but hidden by the shortage of Precambrian animal fossils. A re-analysis of fossils from the Burgess Shale lagerstätte increased interest in the issue when it revealed animals, such as Opabinia, which did not fit into any known phylum. At the time these were interpreted as evidence that the modern phyla had evolved very rapidly in the Cambrian explosion and that the Burgess Shale's [...] "weird wonders" [...] showed that the Early Cambrian was a uniquely experimental period of animal evolution. Later discoveries of similar animals and the development of new theoretical approaches led to the conclusion that many of the [...] "weird wonders" [...] were evolutionary [...] "aunts" [...] or [...] "cousins" [...] of modern groups—for example that Opabinia {{was a member of the}} lobopods, a group which includes the ancestors of the arthropods, and that it may have been closely related to the modern tardigrades. Nevertheless, there is still much debate about whether the Cambrian explosion was really explosive and, if <b>so,</b> how and <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> and <b>why</b> <b>it</b> appears unique in the history of animals.|$|R
40|$|It {{is only a}} {{question}} of opening our eyes to the extra ordinary world around us. Nature has been lavish in good design. It is therefore us to see, exposed in full view within our reach at all times, without even moving from where we are. " Paul Jacques Grillio (1960 : p 9) So many channels in the world give way to design buildings in harmony within nature most of the design buildings do not {{go hand in hand}} with nature. The main problem is, when designing the "essence" of nature has not been captured in architecture. Everything is created according to the principles of nature. <b>So,</b> <b>why</b> should <b>it</b> not <b>happen</b> in the architectural world ? This phenomena can be understood by making it exposed full view to the surrounding environment, fauna and flora. That is the main channel that would direct us to the correct path. Man interpreted this inspiration as an intelligent understanding of nature rather than a perceptible understanding of it. Those experience studies of surrounding environment give way to create architecture in harmony with nature, with out simply having superficial imitation. This indicates the observation which was made by Ananada. K. Coomaraswamy in “Traditional Art and Symbolism". " Art imitates nature in her manner of operation" that statement can be implied to architecture to understand the truth of the design with nature...|$|R

The {{programmes}} {{examined the}} development of music in particular places and periods {{in the history of}} Western Civilisation between Antiquity {{and the end of the}} 20th Century. As well as Continental Europe, music in Spain, Scandinavia, Russia and the Americas is discussed. The series is not a history of music as such but discusses the context in which music flourished — social, cultural and intellectual. The books are aimed at the general reader, and the Preface in each volume states — 'We want to explain not what <b>happened,</b> but [...] <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened,</b> and <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> when and where it did'.
