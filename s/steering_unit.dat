25|$|Beam <b>Steering</b> <b>Unit</b> (BSU) and Receiver Beam Former (REX) {{replacements}} {{were made}} on the four Cape Cod and Beale radars in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Also new was a variable-ratio power <b>steering</b> <b>unit</b> {{along with}} revised front {{suspension}} geometry for improved {{ride and handling}} under Buick's tradename of Accu-Drive. Steel rails were also built into the doors (and rear quarter panels on coupes and convertibles)for improved side impact protection {{as was the case}} with all 1969 GM B- and C-body cars.|$|E
25|$|The ship's {{steering}} gear {{consists of a}} <b>steering</b> <b>unit</b> and twin semi-balanced underhung rudders. There is an emergency steering station in the superstructure {{in the event of}} damage to the bridge and they can also be operated by hand from the {{steering gear}} compartment. To improve the ship's performance in a seaway, they are fitted with a B+V Simplex Compact stabiliser system.|$|E
50|$|The <b>{{steering}}</b> <b>units</b> {{to steer}} the kites safely are mounted on the ground vehicles. Four tethers are steering the kite. Each one of these tethers is capable to pull down the kite safely.|$|R
2500|$|A further {{change was}} made to the transmission. Rather than risk the {{availability}} of the combined Wilson transmission and steering affecting production, the A13 [...] "crash" [...] gear box was used with epicyclic <b>steering</b> <b>units.</b> This had the knock-on effect of a reduced size of cooling fan for the transmission compartment.|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} some {{problems}} with early 2003 Police Interceptors. The newly designed steel wheels would rust prematurely, and the rack and pinion <b>steering</b> <b>units</b> would fail early (≤10,000 miles). This {{was not limited to}} the Police Interceptor; some 2004 Mercury Marauders were also affected. A recent recall (04M05) affects the steel wheels used on 2003-05 Police Interceptors.|$|R
500|$|The {{suspension}} {{was entirely}} new, adding adjustable anti-roll bars. [...] The brakes were redesigned {{to adapt the}} use of a driver-adjustable brake pressure balance, while the servo-activated braking system was removed. [...] A racing steering rack was used in place of the standard power <b>steering</b> <b>unit.</b> [...] Pneumatic jacks were later added to the cars in the 1980 season to allow for quicker pit stops. [...] Goodyear racing tires were used on all cars. [...] All other non-essential items from the road car were not included, bringing the Procar M1's weight down to [...] [...] The performance of the Procar M1s was increased to a top speed of [...] dependent upon gear ratios, and acceleration from 0– in 4.3seconds. [...] Each Procar M1 cost approximately US$60,000.|$|E

2500|$|The base (standard and CE) and S trims are {{available}} with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, while the LE (unlike the previous generation) and XLE are automatic only. The XRS grade is equipped with the 2.4-liter 2AZ-FE I4 engine, the same one used in the Camry, good for [...] and [...] of torque, {{with a choice of}} five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmissions. The XRS takes 7.9 seconds to [...] and 16.0 seconds for the quarter-mile. All other trims have Toyota's new 1.8-liter 2ZR-FE four-cylinder engine with [...] and [...] of torque. Corollas with the 1.8-liter engine have an EPA fuel economy rating of 27 mpg city/35 mpg highway, both numbers being lower than those achieved by the previous generation. The 2.4-liter is rated at 22 mpg/30 mpg with the automatic and 22 mpg/29 mpg with the manual. [...] All engines are ULEV II certified. Toyota carried over the 13.2 gal fuel tank from earlier models. In order to help improve fuel economy the new Corolla uses an electric power <b>steering</b> <b>unit</b> instead of a belt driven hydraulic pump.|$|E
2500|$|The {{air-cooled}} Villiers 10D [...] engine had a {{unit construction}} three-speed manual gearbox without reverse. This had an output of [...] at 4,400rpm which the manufacturers claimed gave a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton unladen. The engine unit sat in an alloy cradle {{ahead of the}} front wheel, together forming part of its support. Both front wheel and engine were sprung {{as part of the}} trailing link front suspension system, which was fitted with a single coil spring and an Andre Hartford friction damper. The rear wheels were rigidly mounted to the body on stub axles with suspension provided by low pressure [...] "balloon" [...] type tyres. Starting was achieved by using a pull handle mounted under the dash panel and connected by cable to a modified kick-start lever on the engine. The steering comprised a system of pulleys and a cable usually referred to as [...] "bobbin and cable", connecting a conventional steering wheel to the front <b>steering</b> <b>unit.</b> The bobbin and cable steering arrangement was replaced by a rack and pinion system in October 1950. Brakes were provided on only the rear wheels; they were conventional drum brakes operated by a system of cables and rods.|$|E
2500|$|At 19:20 that night, a major {{air attack}} began while {{the task force}} was under way off Kwajalein. At 23:22, {{parachute}} flares from Japanese planes silhouetted the carrier, and 10 minutes later, she {{was hit by a}} torpedo on the starboard side, knocking out her steering gear. Nine people were killed, two on the fantail and seven in the chief petty officers' mess room, which was a repair party station during general quarters. Four members of the affected repair party survived because they were sitting on a couch that apparently absorbed the shock of the explosion. Settling [...] by the stern, the carrier began circling to port amidst dense clouds of smoke pouring from ruptured tanks aft. To maintain water-tight integrity, damage control crews were ordered to seal the damaged compartments and welded them shut, applying heavy steel plates where needed. An emergency hand-operated <b>steering</b> <b>unit</b> was quickly devised, and Lexington made Pearl Harbor for emergency repairs, arriving on 9 December. She reached Bremerton, Washington, on December 22 for full repairs, completed on February 20, 1944. The error in judgment concerning opening fire at night was never repeated, as thereafter gun crews were ordered to open fire anytime the ship came under attack. Following this attack, the ship was reported as sunk by Japan's Tokyo Rose, the first of several such assertions.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal International Journal of Human Factors Modelling and Simulation and the definitive published version is available at [URL] interior designs for vehicles may improve the safety of pregnant occupants without compromising the safety of non-pregnant occupants.

50|$|The BvS 10 {{is similar}} to, but {{distinct}} from, the Bv 206 or Bv 206S. It {{is a much}} larger and fully amphibious armoured vehicle based upon the characteristic twin-cab, articulated steering system typical of Hägglunds all-terrain vehicles. The main differences from the older Bv206s are a more powerful Cummins 5.9 litre diesel engine, improved ground clearance, and newly developed chassis, power train and <b>steering</b> <b>units</b> that give the vehicle considerably enhanced speed (from previous 51.5 km/h on road) and comfort on road and in terrain, as well as greater load-carrying capability (up to 5 tons), {{and the ability to}} add various modular sub-systems such as add-on armour, weapon mounts, a load-changer and cargo platforms.|$|R

2500|$|At the {{motorcycle}} show in November 1951, Sharp's announced what they described as [...] "a revolutionary {{design in the}} field of commercial vehicles". [...] The Sharp's Commercial 3 Cwt took the concept of the Minicar's light, three-wheeled, utilitarian design, and adapted it as the basis for an open-top lightweight industrial vehicle. The yellow and black prototype at the show was powered by an Indian Brave [...] four-stroke side valve engine (supplied by Brockhouse Engineering Co., Southport) and mounted in a cradle ahead and above the front wheel. Though described as [...] "constructed on the stressed-skin principle", large cut outs to allow easy access from either side of the vehicle required much additional strengthening to the floor, with a central steel backbone girder, a cross member between the rear wheels and further triangular bracing. The single seat was located centrally as was the steering wheel. Steering was by worm and sector, and flared side panels allowed the single front wheel to turn a full 180°, making the vehicle extremely manoeuvrable. The entire engine, drive-train and <b>steering</b> <b>unit</b> could be removed by undoing four bolts to allow for easy servicing. Unlike the Minicar, there were brakes on all three wheels and there was a wooden-slatted floor behind the driver. Though the Sharp's Commercial never entered production, it served as a forerunner to van and pickup versions of the Mark B which appeared in 1952.|$|E
2500|$|The 1988 Fiero {{brought a}} new {{suspension}} design, thought by many to have {{a striking resemblance to}} those designed by Lotus, which at the time, was about to be acquired by General Motors. The suspension was never a Lotus design though; it was the suspension the Pontiac engineers had designed in the beginning, along with what they learned from the racing program. Up front were revised control arms and knuckles that reduced steering effort and improved the scrub radius. In the back, the old Citation parts were replaced with a real tri-link suspension with all new knuckles. This new suspension came with staggered wheel sizes on WS6 suspension equipped models, with [...] by [...] wide wheels up front and [...] by [...] wide wheels in the rear for improved handling balance and to offset the slightly increased front track that resulted from the improvements. Topping off the package were the new vented disc brakes at all four corners, which addressed braking complaints of road testers. A variable effort electro-hydraulic power <b>steering</b> <b>unit,</b> the same design later found on the GM EV1, was also to be a late addition. This option never made it to production — one reason cited is that models with the prototype power steering were noted as being too loud. The four-cylinder engine received an in-pan oil filter element and balance shaft. A [...] "Formula" [...] option was added, which offered many of the GT features with the standard coupe body, including the [...] speedometer, WS6 Suspension (which includes offset crosslace wheels) and the rear spoiler. 1988 marked the end of production for the Fiero, and is also considered to be the best Fiero produced. Improvements to suspension, brakes, steering, and improvements to both the four-cylinder and V6 engines took the car to a level far beyond the 1984 model that had received much criticism. 1988 was also the only year a yellow exterior color was available as a factory option. During the Fiero's final model year (on August 16, 1988) the last window sticker was placed on the last Fiero to roll off the Pontiac, Michigan plant line. The 1988 Fiero is the most desired by automotive collectors because of the improvements made to the 1988 model year, and this being the last year of production. The 1988 Mera seen as the most sought after model and tops the Fiero list in resale value this model is commonly used to create [...] "kit cars" [...] (replicas of high end sports cars).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Creating latency {{insensitive}} or asynchronous designs from clocked designs {{has potential}} benefits of increased modularity and robustness to variations. Several transformations have been suggested in the literature and each of these require a handshake control network (examples include synchronous elasticization and desynchronization). Numerous implementations of the control network are possible. This paper reports on an algorithm that has been proven to generate an optimal control network consisting of the minimum number of 2 -input join and 2 -output fork control components. This can substantially reduce the area and power consumption of a system. The algorithm has been implemented in a CAD tool, called CNG.

50|$|Depending on {{the final}} {{application}} of a crosswind-kite-power source, appropriate kite control methods are involved. Human control exercised during the full flight session is exampled in crosswind stunt kiting and kiteboarding; the same {{has been in place}} for some electricity-producing crosswind-kite-power source, e.g., by Pierre Benhaiem of France. When the crosswind-kite-power source becomes too large to handle, then companies are building both human-assisted devices and also fully autonomous robotic control systems. Also, there has been demonstrated fully passive crosswind-kite-power source where natural frequencies of a system do permit the absence of human or robot controls; actually, anyone seeing a kited wing toss left and then right in constant motion is seeing a primitive passively controlled crosswind-kite-power source. Advances in computers, sensors, kite <b>steering</b> <b>units,</b> and servo-mechanisms are being applied to attain full autonomy of the launching, flying, and landing of crosswind-kite-power source that are aiming for the utility-scale energy-production market.|$|R
