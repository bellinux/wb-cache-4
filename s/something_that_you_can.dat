[...] "Whether that was worthwhile", he added, [...] "is a matter for the historian to judge". The key lesson, he felt, was not to intervene in a conflict [...] "unless you are prepared to win", because it was [...] "not <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just put one foot in and feel the temperature".|$|E

People {{do all kinds of}} things to get noticed in politics, but Ann wasn't there for anyone but Ann. She was someone who loved the movies, loved the tactile {{experience}} of being in the movie theater, loved talking about movies, loved meeting filmmakers– I think she was more excited to meet filmmakers than foreign dignitaries. At the Texas Film Hall of Fame, she was as much a celebrity at that event as anyone honored. People paid money to see her as much as anyone else there. She would often ride down to Austin on the New York plane with the celebrities being honored. One year it was with Ethan Hawke. All she wanted to talk about, at the pre-party, was that [...] "Ethan Hawke is so cute." [...] She loved him. This was not something that could be faked. She was starstruck. She loved these guys … (Watching a clip from Terrence Malick’s [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] at a Hall of Fame ceremony), she is mesmerized by this image. I mean, her eyes are glued to that screen. Again this is not <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> fake. And {{she looked at me and}} she said [...] "I love the movies" [...] with this childlike voice, this passion. Standing next to me at that moment was not the former governor, a political swordsman... she was like all the rest of us, just someone who loved the movies. It’s a terrible loss for Texas in so many ways, but for the cultural community to have an advocate in that position, you don’t have that but once a generation, if you’re lucky."– ...|$|E

[...] "I'm weak in technique, because I haven't been taught, but I imagine I've got sensibility. It's plain <b>that</b> when <b>you</b> paint a portrait you must study form and color, but there's <b>something</b> else <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> only feel. I don't mean the character that's expressed by the mouth and eyes; it's something vague and elusive <b>that</b> psychologists give <b>you</b> a hint of when they talk about the aura.

It {{is a little}} apparatus of two hollow brass hemispheres, closely fitted together, and having connected with it a pipe and a cock, through which we can exhaust the air from the inside; and although the two halves are so easily taken apart, while the air is left within, yet you will see, when we exhaust it by-and-by, no power of any two of {{you will be able}} to pull them apart. Every square inch of surface that is contained in the area of that vessel sustains fifteen pounds by weight, or nearly so, when the air is taken out; and you may try your strength presently in seeing whether you can overcome that pressure of the atmosphere.|$|E
60|$|There it lingers, I should say, till dawn, bathing the golden-brown facade in an effulgence that lifelong absence cannot eclipse when {{once it has}} blessed your sight. It is {{beauty that}} rather makes the heart ache, and the charm of the Steps from above is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> bear better if you are very, very worthy, or have the conceit of feeling {{yourself}} so. It is a charm that imparts itself more in detail and is less exclusively the effect of perpetual sunset. From the parapet against which you lean you have a perfecter conception of the architectural form than you get from below, and you are never tired of seeing the successive falls of the Steps dividing themselves and then coming together on the broad landings and again parting and coming together.|$|E

60|$|Then, in {{the matter}} of age; though young fellows do not imagine it, it is very easy to marry a wife too young. Marriage has been defined as a foolish bargain in which one man {{provides}} for another man's daughter, but {{there is no reason why}} this should go so far as completing her education. If your conception of happiness is having something pretty and innocent and troublesome about you, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> cherish and make happy, a pet rabbit is in every way preferable. At the worst that will nibble your boots. I have known several cases of the girl-wife, and it always began like an idyll, charmingly; the tenderest care on one hand, winsome worship on the other--until some little thing, a cut chin or a missing paper, startled the pure and natural man out of his veneer, dancing and blaspheming, with the most amazing consequences. Only a proven saint should marry a girl-wife, and his motives might be misunderstood. The idyllic wife is a beautiful thing to read about, but in practice idylls should be kept episodes; in practice the idyllic life is a little too like a dinner that is all dessert. A common man, after a time, tires of winsome worship; he craves after companionship, and a sympathy based on experience. The ordinary young man, with the still younger wife, I have noticed, continues to love her with all his heart--and spends his leisure telling somebody else's wife all about it. If in these days of blatant youth an experienced man's counsel is worth anything, it would be to marry a woman considerably older than oneself, if one must marry at all. And while upon this topic--and I have lived long--the ideal wife, I am persuaded, from the close observation of many years, is invariably, by some mishap, a widow....|$|E

5000|$|Scarcity is a {{principle}} that people underestimate. When something has limited availability, people assign it more value. According to Cialdini, [...] "people want {{more of what}} they cannot have." [...] When scarcity is an issue, the context matters. This means that within certain contexts, scarcity [...] "works" [...] better. To get people to believe <b>that</b> <b>something</b> is scarcer, <b>you</b> need to explain what about that certain product will give them what no other product will. You have to work the audience in the correct way. <b>Something</b> else <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do {{to get people to}} believe <b>that</b> <b>something</b> is scarce, is to tell them what they will lose, not what they will gain. Saying things like [...] "you will lose $5", rather than saying [...] "you could save $5". You are making something sound more scarce.|$|R

40|$|This guide {{discusses}} {{the practice of}} weatherizing your home through weatherstripping. Selection of materials, types of weatherstripping and buying and installing these products are discussed. Insulation is {{not the whole story}} for energy conservation! Even if your home is well-insulated, energy may be wasted through air infiltration. Air can leak around doors and windows, foundations, chimneys, exterior plumbing, etc. In the winter, air heated by your furnace is lost to the outside; in summer, hot outdoor air puts an extra load on your air conditioner. If your home is typical, one-half to three-quarters of your fuel bill is the result of air infiltration. Weatherizing your home by caulking and weatherstripping can effectively reduce energy waste. In fact, the cost of caulking and weatherstripping can usually be paid back in energy savings in less than one year. This makes weatherizing one of your best investments in energy conservation.

40|$|I {{was taught}} that crystal growing is a knack (a special ready {{capacity}} {{that is hard}} to analyze and teach), not an art (a skill acquired by experience, study or observation). In some ways this is true, an art can be taught and learned, while a knack is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> just <b>can</b> do. To me juggling is a knack, try as you might to teach me to juggle and you will fail. The same is true about crystal growing. We all know some people who can grow crystals quite by accident and some that could not grow a crystal if their science depended on it. With that said, there are techniques that could help even those of us who grow the worst crystals (or none at all). One story is told of a research group that could grow beautiful crystals of a compound in their old laboratories but when they moved to a new lab, they could not. It seems that the old lab was filled with “seed ” crystals in the form of dust particles and these microscopic crystals would perpetuate the crystallization flasks and “seed ” new crystal growth. Such variables can make or break a crystal grower; so much care must be taken to insure the number of random variables is kept to a minimum. With some practice <b>you</b> may find <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have the “touch ” for growing good crystals. If not maybe this sheet may help...|$|R
