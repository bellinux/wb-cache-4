Maddock was a familiar figure in the drivers' paddock of the 1950s in open-neck shirt and woolly jumper and a prime force behind the rise of British racing cars to their dominant position in the 1960s.Describing how the revolutionary rear-engined Cooper chassis came to be, Maddock explained, [...] "I'd done various schemes for the new car which I'd shown to Charlie Cooper. He kept saying 'Nah, Whiskers, that's not it, try again.' Finally, I got so fed up I sketched a frame in which every tube was bent, meant just as a joke. I showed it to Charlie and to my astonishment he grabbed it and said: 'That's it!'

Steel plates in DSC panels used as two-way slabs or shearwalls may buckle locally between stud shear connectors when subjected to in-plane biaxial compression. This paper investigates {{the local and}} post-local buckling behaviour of biaxially compressed steel plates restrained by shear connectors and concrete in DSC panels by using the finite element modelling technique. Local buckling coefficients are obtained for steel plates with various aspect ratios, biaxial loading and boundary conditions by incorporating the shear stiffness effect of stud shear connectors. These buckling coefficients {{can be used to}} determine limiting width-to-thickness ratios for steel plates and the distribution of stud shear connectors. A geometric and material non-linear analysis is undertaken to quantify the post-local buckling strength of steel plates under biaxial compression. The initial imperfections of steel plates and non-linear shear-slip characteristics of stud shear connectors are taken into account in the post-local buckling analysis. Based on numerical results, biaxial strength interaction curves and formulae are developed for the ultimate strength design of steel plates in double <b>skin</b> <b>composite</b> construction...|$|E

We are developing a <b>skin</b> <b>composite</b> formed from sterilized human de-epidermized acellular dermis, keratinocytes and fibroblasts with the ultimate aim of using this composite to cover full-thickness excised burn wounds. These composites can be prepared with or without basement membrane (BM) antigens initially present on the dermis.

Skin composites prepared from dermis with BM antigens either present or absent initially were studied throughout 3 weeks. Composites with BM antigens present initially were significantly better than those initially lacking BM antigens in: (i) the degree of epithelial cell attachment to the underlying dermis (hemidesmosomes were seen only in the former); (ii) the morphology of the epithelial layer; (iii) the consistent presence of collagen IV and laminin and the increasing expression of tenascin; and (iv) the amount of soluble collagen IV and fibronectin detected in the conditioned media.

Member beam, column and slab have been studied under monotonic, cyclic and fatigue loading, and there are also a few studies on impact loading to assess the structural response of such constructions. Validating connectivity between the DSC beam and DSC columns is behind the usage of such constructional systems since all the present studies focus on individual members. The main objective of this thesis was to introduce the Double <b>Skin</b> <b>Composite</b> (DSC) beam-column joint as a new structural element. Experimental investigation and Nonlinear Finite Element Modelling (FEM) of the structural behaviour of the DSC joint subjected to monotonic and quasi-static loading was introduced. Five DSC joints have been tested to assess the efficiency of the DSC beam-column joint in its basic design and to identify the most efficient strengthening method. Further, six DSC beam-column joints were tested to study the effect of steel fibre (SF) and the effect of high-strength concrete (HSC) on the behaviour of the joint under monotonic loading and under cyclic loading. The general FE Package ABAQUS 6. 10 was used to model the nonlinear behaviour of the DSC joint. The Concrete Damage Plasticity Model (CDPM) was used to model the concrete in tension and compression, and the steel elements of the composite were modelled using the elastic-plastic model.

More sustainable cement‐based systems can be developed through the use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) to partially replace cement content.

40|$|Composites {{of human}} de-epidermised {{acellular}} dermis and normal adult human keratinocytes and fibroblasts were examined for {{the ability of}} cells to contract these composites. Image analysis of {{the outline of the}} composites showed that, in this model, keratinocytes alone or in the presence of fibroblasts caused highly significant contraction (of the order of 25 % by day 12). There was no significant contraction of the dermis with libroblasts alone or in the absence of cells. The presence or absence of basement membrane antigens did not influence the effect of keratinocytes on dermal contraction. Analysis of the conditioned media from these composites showed that the greatest fibronectin production was seen with fibroblasts alone in the presence of basement membrane. Keratinocytes alone produced little libronectin irrespective of the presence of the basement membrane. If keratinocytes were present with libroblasts, however, then libronectin production was significantly reduced both in the presence and absence of the basement membrane, indicating that keratinocytes modify dermal libroblast extracellular matrix production.

The lateral deflection of the PSSDB panel with door opening is determined using the finite element analysis method and LUSAS is the best software program are using to analyse the lateral deflection of the panel. The finite element analysis is a computer-based numerical technique for calculating the strength and behaviour of the structure. It can be used to calculated deflection, stress, vibration, buckling behaviour and many other phenomena. It can be used to analyse either small or large-scale deflection. It can analyse elastic deformation, or “permanently bent out of shape” plastic deformation. The computer is required for this analysis because the astronomical number or calculation needed to analyse a complex structure. For this case the axial load is transferred to the wall through the profile steel sheet and dry board. The Lateral deflection of the panel increased under the increment of uniaxial compressive load. Analytical solutions for lateral deflection of the panel in uniaxial compressive load are obtained. The type of analysis is linear analysis.

It has been verified that the use of these fibers at an appropriate dosage can change the behavior of structural members from brittle to ductile. Further, since the discovery of carbon nanotubes/fibers (CNT/CNF), they have been also considered as efficient fibers to be used in construction materials such as concrete. Previous experimental work has shown that incorporation of CNF in cementitious composites can enhance the mechanical behavior of material by reducing the size of macro- and micro-cracks resulting in higher strength and ductility.

CO 2 post-combustion capture {{is one of the}} currently intensively investigated applications and experiments are most often performed on lab scale hollow fiber modules with a monoethanolamine (MEA) aqueous solution, usually in a large excess, as chemical solvent. Different mathematical models, showing a broad range of intrinsic complexity, have been already proposed in order to simulate or predict the separation performances of membrane contactors for this application. Unfortunately, no systematic comparison of the different modeling approaches has been performed yet. This study addresses this issue through a series of experiments performed on the two main types of hollow fiber membrane contactors (microporous PTFE and dense PMP <b>skin</b> <b>composite</b> membrane) under different sets of operating conditions. Four different types of models (constant overall mass transfer coefficient, 1 D resistance in series, 1 D and 2 D convection-diffusion models) have been compared with the membrane mass transfer coefficient as the only adjustable parameter. It is shown that the different models lead to comparable predictions of the experimental results, with slightly similar membrane mass transfer coefficient values. This result addresses key questions in terms of strategy for model validation and with regard to the current trend of increasing model complexity. Interestingly, a different situation holds when MEA is significantly converted at the liquid outlet: in that case, a 1 D model approach is required (variable mass transfer coefficient), and leads to results which are comparable to 2 D models.

Due to localised stiffening, stress concentrations arise which can initiate damage e. g. debonding or delamination, within the composite structure. Critically, this damage can propagate under fatigue loading compromising the structural integrity of the component. To mitigate against this risk, significant safety margins are used within the design phase, which limit the potential weight savings offered by the application of advanced fibre reinforced composites. In this study, the potential to redirect propagating cracks away from critical failure paths and into dedicated self-healing zones has been investigated {{through the use of}} thermoplastic interleaves (for redirection) and an embedded vascular network (to mitigate the damage). One of the major challenges in employing a vascular network is to ensure the connectivity between the propagating damage and the vascules. A self-healing agent (low viscosity epoxy resin) was delivered via the vascular network in order to restore the mechanical performance of the deteriorated structural element. A number of different interleave 9 ̆ 6 vascule configurations have been investigated, all successfully redirecting the propagating fatigue damage into the vascules within skin-stiffener debonding specimens. The tensile and fatigue tests performed have shown that these modifications are not detrimental to the mechanical performance in comparison to a baseline configuration. Moreover, the interleave configurations are able to redirect the interfacial damage, between the skin and the stiffener, towards the self-healing functionality embedded within the laminate. During fatigue loading, a notable stiffness loss is observed as the damage propagates.

It is also reported to influence melanoma invasion with levels of alpha-, beta- and gamma-MSH correlated clinically with malignant melanoma development, but other studies suggest alpha-MSH acts to retard invasion. In the present study, we investigated the action of alpha-MSH on three human melanoma cell lines (HBL, A 375 -SM and C 8161) differing in metastatic potential. alpha-melanocyte-simulating hormone reduced invasion through fibronectin and also through a human reconstructed <b>skin</b> <b>composite</b> model for the HBL line, and inhibited proinflammatory cytokine-stimulated activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. However, A 375 -SM and C 8161 cells did not respond to alpha-MSH. Immunofluorescent microscopy and Western blotting identified melanocortin- 1 receptor (MC- 1 R) expression for all three lines and MC- 2 R on HBL and A 375 -SM lines. Receptor binding identified a similar affinity for alpha-MSH for all three lines with the highest number of binding sites on HBL cells. Only the HBL melanoma line demonstrated a detectable cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response to alpha-MSH, although all three lines responded to acute alpha-MSH addition (+(-) -N(6) -(2 -phenylisopropyl) -adenosine (PIA)) with an elevation in intracellular calcium. The nonresponsive lines displayed MC- 1 R polymorphisms (C 8161, Arg (wt) 151 /Cys 151; A 375 -SM, homozygous Cys 151), whereas the HBL line was wild type. Stable transfection of the C 8161 line with wild-type MC- 1 R produced cells whose invasion was significantly inhibited by alpha-MSH.

Kockums have successfully produced ships in sandwich composite material, which is a light and stiff but expensive material concept. Building a vessel in single <b>skin</b> <b>composite</b> might result in a lower total life cycle cost due to several factors. Kockums wish to acquire more information of the affecting factors thus they have initiated this project. The project includes analyzing the accumulated cost of a concept patrol vessel while changing five variables: class notation ("Patrol" or "Passenger"), operational profile (10 or 35 knots), material concept (sandwich or single skin), material (carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP)) and choice of propulsion system (controllable pitch propeller (CPP), Inboard Performance System (IPS) or water jet) resulting in 48 versions of the vessel. First, the structural arrangement was adapted to the design loads of each version by iteratively seeking the maximal structural utilization of the elements. This was done by using a computational tool (RSTRUCT) that allows for effective scantling calculation. Then, the material, production and operational cost were determined for each version and the break-even points in terms of years of operation were found. The results gave insights concerning the characteristics of the different material concepts. The single skin versions were found to be both heavier (70 %) and more costly in terms of material and production cost (17 %) in relation to their sandwich equivalents. The break-even points between CFRP versions and GFRP versions were ranging between 4 and 14 years, depending on operational profile. For example, for a very low speed profile passenger vessel the break-even point was 40 years, implying that the GFRP version was the most beneficial choice. Regarding propulsion choices, the IPS system was the best choice for every version due to its high overall propulsive coefficient in a broad speed range...|$|E

The improved mechanical properties of the core structure combined with the high-strength and lightweight glass fiber <b>composite</b> <b>skins</b> suggest a high potential of the novel composite sandwich panel for structural applications. Furthermore, {{the results of this study}} provide an understanding of the fundamental behavior of the constituent materials of a novel sandwich structure providing a base knowledge from which further research could continue...|$|R
40|$|Strong {{acids and}} bases {{has been widely}} applied in {{commercial}} gelatin industry, but the application of weak acids and bases has not been much done. Application of a solution of strong acids and bases {{could be expected to}} affect human health and uneconomical, therefore it requires further study on the possibility of the their application in the production process of gelatin. Quantity and quality of gelatin associated with changes in their structure of collagen fibers. Research has been conducted on the histological profile of collagen fibers from Bligon goat skin soaked in weak acids and bases. Weak acid (CH 3 COOH 0. 5 M) and weak base (Ca(OH) 2 100 g/L) was used as a soak solution, each of which was made into three concentration levels (3, 6 and 9 % v/v).   Samples of <b>skin</b> <b>composites</b> made duplo size 3 x 3 cm and each soaked for 4 days and were then made histological preparations. Subsequent histological profiles were analyzed descriptively. Results showed that the changes in the structure of skin collagen fibers in CH 3 COOH 0. 5 M more significant than Ca(OH) 2 100 g/L and control (without soaked) for the same level of concentration. Key words: Histological, collagen fibers, bligon goat skin, weak acids and base...|$|R
