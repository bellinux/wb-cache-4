5|$|Evans was {{the only}} member of the Apple entourage to be invited to attend (and be a witness) when McCartney and Linda Eastman were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 12 March 1969. Evans wrote in his diary that he was due to be there at 9.45am, but McCartney's brother, Michael's train from Birmingham was late. Peter Brown and Evans passed the {{register}} office at 9.15, and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were only a few photographers and ardent fans standing in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30am, they were mobbed by a crowd of about 1,000 people. When the Beatles played on the roof of Apple's offices in Savile Row, Evans was told to delay the policemen (who had arrived to stop the concert), as long as was possible.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} Anglo-Maratha war, Shinde and Holkar had lost {{many of their}} territories to the British. They {{encouraged}} the Pindaris to raid the British territories. The Pindaris, who were mostly cavalry, {{came to be known}} as the Shindeshahi and the Holkarshahi after the patronage they received from the respective defeated Maratha leaders. The Pindari leaders were Setu, Karim Khan, Dost Mohammad, Tulsi, Imam Baksh, Sahib Khan, Kadir Baksh, Nathu, and Bapu. Of these, Setu, Karim Khan, and Dost Mohammad belonged to Shindeshahi and the rest to Holkarshahi. The total strength of the Pindaris in 1814 was estimated at 33,000. The Pindaris frequently raided villages in Central India. The result of the Pindari raids was that Central India was being rapidly reduced to the condition of a desert because the peasants were unable to support themselves on the land. They had no option but to join the robber bands or starve. In 1815, 25,000 Pindaris entered the Madras Presidency and destroyed over 300 villages on the Coromandel coast. Another band swept the Nizam's kingdom while a third entered Malabar. Other Pindari raids on British territory followed in 1816 and 1817. Francis Rawdon-Hastings <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> could not be peace or security in India until the predatory Pindaris were extinguished.|$|E

25|$|George Holloway {{was already}} a {{successful}} businessman, having already {{established himself as a}} boat builder and merchant/trader, when in 1847 he applied for permission to remove the ironstone doggers at the foot of Hengistbury Head. Holloway owned a small fleet of windjammers that were engaged in the business of bringing coal from Southampton to the town quay. He required something as ballast for the return journey and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a good profit to be made from shipping the ironstone.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 1970s, {{hand-held}} electronic calculators were very costly, at two or three weeks' wages, and so were a luxury item. The high price was due to their construction requiring many mechanical and electronic components which were costly to produce, and production runs that were too small to exploit economies of scale. Many firms <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were good profits {{to be made in the}} calculator business with the margin on such high prices. However, the cost of calculators fell as components and their production methods improved, and the effect of economies of scale was felt.|$|E

500|$|Having {{found his}} {{substitute}} for the chorales, Tippett wrote off to America for a collection of spirituals. When this arrived, [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was one for every key situation in the oratorio". He chose five: [...] "Steal Away"; [...] "Nobody Knows the Trouble I See, Lord"; [...] "Go Down, Moses"; [...] "O, By and By"; and [...] "Deep River". The first, fourth and fifth of these are placed {{at the ends of}} the oratorio's three parts, [...] "Deep River" [...] as the finale expressing, according to Tippett, the hope of a fresh spring after a long, dark winter. [...] Kenneth Gloag, in his detailed analysis of the oratorio, writes: [...] "As well as constructing the pathway through the dramatic narrative, the five spirituals also combine to provide moments of focus and repose ... giving shape to both the musical and literary dimensions of the work". Tippett felt that the work encapsulated all his current political, moral and psychological preoccupations.|$|E
500|$|The Pacific Northwest murders culminated on Sunday, July 14 {{with the}} broad {{daylight}} abductions {{of two women}} from a crowded beach at Lake Sammamish State Park in Issaquah, [...] east of Seattle. Five female witnesses described an attractive young man wearing a white tennis outfit with his left arm in a sling, speaking with a light accent, perhaps Canadian or British. Introducing himself as [...] "Ted," [...] he asked their help in unloading a sailboat from his tan or bronze-colored Volkswagen Beetle. Four refused; one accompanied him {{as far as his}} car, <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no sailboat, and fled. Three additional witnesses saw him approach Janice Anne Ott, 23, a probation case worker at the King County Juvenile Court, with the sailboat story, and watched her leave the beach in his company. About four hours later, Denise Marie Naslund, a 19-year-old woman who was studying to become a computer programmer, left a picnic to go to the restroom and never returned. Bundy told Stephen Michaud that Ott was still alive when he returned with Naslund—and that one was forced to watch as the other was murdered—but he later denied it in an interview with Lewis {{on the eve of his}} execution.|$|E

The great desire among the German Socialists in the country {{at that time was}} to have Socialism become native to the soil; for they <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> could be no progress otherwise.

Taylor does not like the way Brooke has been running everything through Ridge." [...] However, Tylo <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a [...] "sticky point" [...] between them because of Darla, and noted that Taylor [...] "would do anything to make up for that". The actress said, [...] "I think it’s very cool that there is so much history behind the two characters. First of all, it does not seem like a sexually based relationship. So I think the audience can appreciate it and go, 'Wow. [...] I can understand these two emotionally bonding,' and then let it grow into something that doesn’t look forced." ...|$|E
2500|$|After losing much of {{his fortune}} in a divorce {{settlement}} in 1987, George Lucas {{had no desire to}} return to Star Wars, and had unofficially canceled the sequel trilogy by the time of Return of the Jedi. At that point, the prequels were only still a series of basic ideas partially pulled from his original drafts of [...] "The Star Wars". Nevertheless, technical advances in the late 1980s and 1990s continued to fascinate Lucas, and he considered that they might make it possible to revisit his 20-year-old material. The popularity of the franchise was reinvigorated by the Star Wars expanded universe storylines set after the original trilogy films, such as the Thrawn trilogy of novels written by Timothy Zahn and the Dark Empire comic book series published by Dark Horse Comics. Due to the renewed popularity of Star Wars, Lucas <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was still a large audience. His children were older, and with the explosion of CGI technology he was now considering returning to directing.|$|E

[...] The President also commented on the displaying of Romanian flags: [...] "What happened yesterday brought indelible shame on our politicians, on the whole of our democracy. The entire Moldovan nation witnessed the greatest humiliation of its own sovereignty and its own democracy when the state standards were ripped from the flagpoles of Parliament and the President's Office and replaced with the flags of Romania."

2500|$|Futurama {{was also}} revived in 2007 by Comedy Central for similar reasons: {{impressive}} viewership in syndication {{as well as}} high DVD sales. In 2006, Twentieth Television struck a deal to produce four direct-to-video animated features based on Futurama, and, in 2009, the series was revived in normal half-hour installments beginning in 2010 on Comedy Central. In a 2006 interview, Futurama creator Matt Groening explained [...] "There's a long, regal history of misunderstood TV shows, and to Fox's credit, the studio looked at the ratings on the Cartoon Network and how the show does overseas, and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was more money to be made." [...] Before Adult Swim lost the rights to Futurama reruns, they aired an all-night marathon on December 31, 2007, thus, marking Futurama's end on the block.

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 10 April 1811, General Cotton climbed the steeple of a church in Bienvenida. He knew that the French were occupying Llerena and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were {{considerable}} numbers of French cavalry five miles closer to him {{near the village of}} Villagarcia. [...] Cotton decided that he should attempt to trap the French cavalry with his superior forces. [...] During the night he despatched Ponsonby with the 12th and 14th Light Dragoons to probe the Villagarcia area, whilst Le Marchant was sent on a circuitous march to get on the French left flank and, it was hoped, cut off their retreat. Slade was also instructed to concentrate his brigade on Bienvenida, though he seems to have been tardy in moving. Cotton retained the 16th Light Dragoons as a reserve. [...] At some time during the night Cotton realised that Ponsonby's force might alert the French before Le Marchant was within striking distance and despatched an aide-de-camp with orders to halt the light cavalry; unfortunately the order arrived too late.|$|E
2500|$|At 09:40 {{the signal}} to {{withdraw}} was sent to all the assault forces - [...] "Vanquish 1100 hours". This presented great difficulties for the LCAs as they were designed best to beach on rising tides and the tide would not rise again for some hours. A few soldiers managed to swim out and {{be picked up by}} friendly craft but many more were killed in the attempt. Unarmoured craft could not come near the beach because the fire was too heavy. Several LCAs went in to evacuate troops, including the four surviving craft of the 10th LCA Flotilla, but suffered due to the intense fire from mortars and machine-guns; two 10th Flotilla craft were sunk. When Ferguson <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no sign of life on the beach, he reluctantly obeyed an order to withdraw. Only one craft, LCA 209, managed to touch down on Blue Beach for the evacuation and while taking wounded aboard it was unable to raise its ramp before it pushed off the beach. Grenades and mortar bombs added more casualties, and with men hanging on to LCA 209's sides, mortar bombs finally sank it. By 08:30 the Royal Regiment had surrendered.|$|E
