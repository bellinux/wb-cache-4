40|$|Steady free-surface flow in open {{channels}} may be analysed by {{the reduction}} of the two-dimensional (2 D) potential flow problem to a quasi- 2 D potential flow approach by inclusion of streamline curvature and inclination effects following Fawer's theory. Flow of water in open channels and groundwater flow with a free surface can be characterized by potential functions and stream functions both obeying Laplace's 2 D equation, provided there is isotropy and homogeneity. It is thus natural to expect the transfer of ideas from the open channel to the groundwater flow. A novel approximate model based on Fawer's theory for steady open channel flows with curved streamlines, coupled with Darcy's law, is proposed for groundwater flow with a free <b>seepage</b> <b>surface.</b> The <b>seepage</b> <b>surface</b> is described by a second-order differential equation which is applied to flow through both rectangular and trapezoidal dams, resulting in good agreement with the full 2 D potential flow methods and test data. © 2011 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.

40|$|Discharge of two springs {{draining}} a zero-order valley at {{the headwaters}} of the Otani River in the Hira Mountains, Shiga Prefecture, was analyzed in relation to the hydrogeomorphological processes producing an interesting microtopography. The hydrographs of the two springs obviously showed three runoff components, I. e., direct runoff, throughflow and baseflow. Direct runoff was analyzed using a time variant function representing the contributing area of a concentration time within a given value, with assumption that the saturation overland flow feeds the direct runoff. Two modes of time variation in the contributing area thus calculated suggest different modes of additional direct flow superposed on the saturation overland flow on the <b>seepage</b> <b>surface</b> of the springs. One is subsurface matrix or pipe flow from extended seepage area at the time of increased groundwater discharge to the springs. The other is a surface flow induced by the stemflow, which represents a kind of Horton overland flow when the rainfall intensity is extremely large. This mode of direct runoff was witnessed at the time of Typhoon No. 20 on 30 September, 1990...|$|E

40|$|Seepage flow is {{an agent}} {{related to the}} {{transport}} and dispersion of contamination in groundwater. Steady two-dimensional seepage flow is governed by Laplace's equation, for which several solution techniques are available. Because computations are complex from a practical point of view, simplified models encompass the Dupuit-Forchheimer approach assuming a horizontal flow. However this approach is inaccurate in seepage problems involving steep drawdowns. In this research, a new theoretical model for 2 D seepage flow is proposed based on Fawer's theory for curved flows Castro-Orgaz (Environ Fluid Mech 10 (3) : 2971 - 2310, 2010), from which a second-order equation results describing the <b>seepage</b> <b>surface.</b> From this development, a numerical solution for the rectangular dam problem based on the second-order model is presented, whereas a simple first-order equation is found to describe flow to drains under a uniform rainfall.

40|$|On August 13, 1995, a slope above Shum Wan Road failed {{due to high}} {{rainfall}} and caused a 30 -m section of Nam Long Shan Road to collapse. The slope consist of weathered tuffs with a clay layer {{on the surface of}} the failure. A hydrogeological study was carried out by saturated finite difference grid model, MODFLOW, for the slope at the Shum Wan Road area. From the ground-water model, it was found that the ground-water level reached three meters below the ground surface during failure. The model is sensitive to recharge and specific yield. The presence of the clay layer helped to maintain a high ground-water level. Stability analyses were performed using SLOPE/W. The result of stability analyses showed that the factor of safety, F, decreased due to the rising initial water table. On the 31 st of July, the factor of safety was 1. 41, and dropped down to 1. 01 on the 3 rd of August. The factor of safety again rose back to 1. 31 on the 8 th of August and it finally dropped down to 0. 99 on the morning of the 13 th of August. The present study showed that the antecedent rainfall had some influence on stability of the slope. The amount of water in the form of seepage, which drained out from the <b>seepage</b> <b>surface</b> from the lower part of the slope, is quantified and found to be 790 m 3. Preventive measures can be taken by inserting horizontal pipes in the slope to drain out the ground water in the form of seepage or by covering the slope with shortcrete or chunam. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a two {{dimensional}} {{finite element model}} is developed to analyze the effects of seepage and traction on slope stability. The finite element model {{was used to determine}} the failure mechanisms associated with tractive and seepage induced failures. Limit equilibrium models were then developed to model both seepage and tractive erosion based on the failure mechanisms indicated by the finite element model. A conceptual model to qualitatively predict the effects of changes in flow regime on the stability of sandbars within recirculating zones was also developed. The finite element model uses Biot's coupled stress-pore water pressure theory to simulate the effects of transient loading conditions on the stresses, phreatic surface variations and displacements within a soil mass. The finite element model's simulations of various events recorded on Grand Canyon sandbars compared favorably with field data. A limit equilibrium model to simulate seepage effects on homogeneous slopes was developed. It is shown that at the <b>seepage</b> <b>surface,</b> the magnitude and direction of the seepage vector are uniquely related and are not independent variables as was previously assumed in the literature. Seepage parallel to the slope is shown to result in the minimum stable seepage slope. Static liquefaction is shown to be possible for a range of seepage directions, depending on the unit weight of the soil. The conceptual model relates the qualitative effects of changes in the flow regime to the geometry of sandbars within recirculating zones. The effects of changes in discharge on the characteristics of the recirculating zones are related to sandbar stability. The predictions of the conceptual model compared favorably with the observed behavior of Grand Canyon sandbars...|$|E
40|$|Vertical wells are {{frequently}} {{used as a}} means of controlling leachate levels in landfills. They are often the only available dewatering option for both old landfills without any basal leachate collection layer and for newer sites where the installed drainage infrastructure has failed.

The numerical groundwater flow model MODFLOW-SURFACT, which contains the functionality to model <b>seepage</b> <b>surfaces,</b> has been used to investigate the transient dewatering of a landfill.
