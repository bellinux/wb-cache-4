5|$|<b>Subglacial</b> eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption characterized by interactions between lava and ice, often under a glacier. The nature of glaciovolcanism dictates that it occurs at areas of high latitude and high altitude. It {{has been suggested that}} <b>subglacial</b> volcanoes that are not actively erupting often dump heat into the ice covering them, producing meltwater. This meltwater mix means that <b>subglacial</b> eruptions often generate dangerous jökulhlaups (floods) and lahars.|$|E
5|$|<b>Subglacial</b> mounds (SUGM) of the Mount Edziza {{volcanic}} complex are {{an unusual}} type of <b>subglacial</b> volcano formed when <b>subglacial</b> eruptions began melting overlying glacial ice {{at a time}} when this region was covered by glacial ice during the Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. These <b>subglacial</b> eruptions were not hot enough to melt a vertical pipe right through the overlying glacial ice, instead forming mounds of hydrated volcanic rock made up of volcanic fragments called hyaloclastite and lava that solidified into pillow-shaped masses called pillow lava deep beneath the glacial ice field. Once the glaciers had retreated, the <b>subglacial</b> volcanoes would be revealed, with a unique shape {{as a result of their}} confinement within glacial ice.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 {{an island}} {{was found in}} {{the central part of the}} lake. Then, in January 2006, the {{discovery}} of two nearby smaller lakes under the ice cap was published; they are named 90 Degrees East and Sovetskaya. It is suspected that these Antarctic <b>subglacial</b> lakes may be connected by a network of <b>subglacial</b> rivers. Centre for Polar Observation & Modelling glaciologists propose that many of the <b>subglacial</b> lakes of Antarctica are at least temporarily interconnected. Because of varying water pressure in individual lakes, large subsurface rivers may suddenly form and then force large amounts of water through the solid ice.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea in {{tropical}} Hawaii. There {{is evidence of}} past <b>subglacial</b> eruptive activity on the volcano {{in the form of}} a <b>subglacial</b> deposit on its summit. The eruptions originated about 10,000 years ago, during the last ice age, when the summit of Mauna Kea was covered in ice.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{geographer}} Andrey Kapitsa used seismic soundings in {{the region}} of Vostok Station made during the Soviet Antarctic Expedition in 1959 and 1964 to measure the thickness of the ice sheet. Kapitsa was the first to suggest the existence of a <b>subglacial</b> lake {{in the region}}, and the subsequent research confirmed his hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The Touchet {{beds are}} formed of {{sediment}} which deposited during the various Missoula Floods, around 16,450 to 13,750BCE, {{and during the}} Bonneville Flood that occurred in approximately 12,500BCE. Another potential source for periodic flooding, still somewhat controversial, is flood release by jökulhlaups from <b>subglacial</b> lakes in British Columbia, but no specific source for these jökulhlaups has yet been identified.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica {{is home to}} {{more than}} 70 lakes that lie {{at the base of the}} {{continental}} ice sheet. Lake Vostok, discovered beneath Russia's Vostok Station in 1996, is the largest of these <b>subglacial</b> lakes. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{emplacement}} of late Pliocene lava domes, lesser activity {{continued into}} the Quaternary period (2.58 million years ago to present). Initial volcanism began on {{the summit of the}} volcano, depositing lava in and adjacent to the Level Mountain Range. This activity is indirectly dated as Pleistocene age , on the bases of the presence of <b>subglacial</b> and/or intraglacial deposits. Meszah Peak, the highest point of both Level Mountain and the Level Mountain Range, was volcanically active during this eruptive period.|$|E
5|$|Around AD1100, natives {{established}} adze quarries {{high up on}} Mauna Kea {{to extract}} the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during <b>subglacial</b> eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and māmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating the finished product.|$|E
5|$|Living Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus {{micro-organisms}} {{have been}} found in Lake Vostok's deep ice core drillings; they are an extant surface-dwelling species. This suggests the presence of a deep biosphere utilizing a geothermal system of the bedrock encircling the <b>subglacial</b> lake. There is optimism that microbial life in the lake may be possible despite high pressure, constant cold, low nutrient input, potentially high oxygen concentration and an absence of sunlight. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus may also harbor lakes or oceans below a thick crust of ice. Any confirmation of life in Lake Vostok could strengthen the prospect for the presence of life on icy moons.|$|E
5|$|The lava domes, calderas, stratovolcanoes, <b>subglacial</b> mounds and cinder cones {{forming the}} {{volcanic}} complex were constructed in five phases, {{each of which}} began with the effusion of dark olivine basalt which formed the flat-lying shield volcanoes and concluded with the eruption of light-coloured magma. This cyclical behavior is attributed to the episodic rise of basic, mantle-derived alkali basalt both {{to the surface and}} partly into crustal reservoirs where the light-coloured magmas with very little aluminum were created by prolonged crystal fractionation. The silica-rich trachyte and comendite lavas are similar to those associated with the most violent eruptions on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in the NCVP can {{be traced}} {{as far back as}} 20 million years ago with the {{emplacement}} of alkali basalt in western Yukon. Several types of volcanic eruptions have since created different landforms across the NCVP, including shield volcanoes, lava domes, stratovolcanoes and cinder cones. Other volcanic formations, notably <b>subglacial</b> volcanoes, take their shape from the environment they formed in regardless of what magma type they produced. The NCVP contains over 100 volcanoes and is the most volcanically active area in Canada, with eruptions expected to occur roughly every 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Chira Endress, {{a student}} of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States, focused on a section of glaciogenic sediments {{immediately}} beneath the same Ice Peak trachyte lava flow sampled and described by Jeff Hungerford during his 2006 studies. Endress ettempted {{to determine if the}} sediments were deposited immediately before the lava flow was emplaced, or if {{they are likely to be}} much older. Endress has quantified the mineralogy of clasts and sand-sized particles from samples in the sediment, and has determined that the mineralogy of several of the trachytic clasts is very similar to that in the overlying lava flow, including the minerals clinopyroxene, magnetite, alkali feldspar, and aenigmatite. Endress has also found small lenses of pristine basaltic glass, which could have derived from the Pillow Ridge <b>subglacial</b> mound near Mount Edziza.|$|E
5|$|Exposed {{along the}} Cheakamus River {{and its tributaries}} are the Cheakamus Valley basalts. Although not {{necessarily}} mapped {{as part of the}} Cayley field, this sequence of basaltic lava flows is geologically similar and comparable in age to volcanic features that are part of this volcanic field. At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0.01and 1.6million years ago. Pillow lava is abundant along the bases the flows, some of which are underlain by hyaloclastite breccia. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of <b>subglacial</b> activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Mathews based this on the age of the underlying till, the existence of pillow lava close to the bottom of some lavas, indicating subaqueous volcanism, the columnar jointing {{at the edges of the}} lavas, indicating rapid cooling, and the absence of apparent palaeogeography.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea is {{the only}} Hawaiian volcano with {{distinct}} evidence of glaciation. Similar deposits probably existed on Mauna Loa, but have been covered by later lava flows. Despite Hawaii's tropical location, during several past ice ages a drop of only a degree in temperature allowed snow to remain at the mountain's summit through summer, triggering {{the formation of an}} ice cap. There are three episodes of glaciation that have been recorded from the last 180,000 years: the Pōhakuloa (180–130ka), Wāihu (80–60ka) and Mākanaka (40–13ka) series. These have extensively sculpted the summit, depositing moraines and a circular ring of till and gravel along the mountain's upper flanks. <b>Subglacial</b> eruptions built cinder cones during the Mākanaka glaciation, most of which were heavily gouged by glacial action. The most recent cones were built between 9000 and 4500 years ago, atop the glacial deposits, although one study indicates that the last eruption may have been around 3600 years ago.|$|E
25|$|Between 54and 30thousand years ago, {{the fifth}} phase of eruptive {{activity}} occurred subglacially and produced two distinct types of lava-breccia associations. The first <b>subglacial</b> eruption between 54and 40thousand years ago produced lava domes and monomict breccia, {{while the other}} <b>subglacial</b> eruption between 40and 30thousand years ago took place under thinner glacial ice.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{discover}} live {{bacteria in}} the <b>subglacial</b> Antarctic Lake Whillans.|$|E
25|$|After Pemberton Belt {{volcanism}} declined 4.0–3.0million years ago, {{volcanic activity}} shifted westwards {{to form the}} younger Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. This represents the modern Canadian Cascade Arc, consisting of lava flows, lava domes, cinder cones, stratovolcanoes, <b>subglacial</b> volcanoes and volcanic plugs. Volcanic activity during the Fraser Glaciation between 25,000and 10,000years ago interacted with glacial ice to form <b>subglacial</b> domes, tuyas and ice-marginal lava flows. Since the Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreated about 10,000years ago, eruptions have been mostly subaerial. The most recent explosive eruption occurred about 2,350years ago and the latest effusive eruption took place less than 1,500years ago.|$|E
25|$|During {{the fourth}} phase of eruptive {{activity}} 54,000years ago, eruptions were again no longer <b>subglacial.</b> Lava flows from {{this phase of}} activity overlie pyroclastic deposits from the third phase of activity and ice-dammed lavas from the seconed phase of activity.|$|E
25|$|Ember Ridge, {{the oldest}} and {{southern}} known parasitic vent, is a <b>subglacial</b> volcano that formed and last erupted during the Pliocene period. It comprises a chain of steep-sided lava domes with glassy, tortuously jointed lava, such as hornblende-phyric basalt.|$|E
25|$|On 6–7 November 1986, {{together}} {{with a team of}} speleologists, Boivin set a world record for a <b>subglacial</b> dive. They dived to a depth of 117 m under the Mer de Glace in their exploration of the Grand Moulin de la Mer de Glace.|$|E
25|$|Evidence also {{exists for}} a deep <b>subglacial</b> trench beneath the glacial outlet, {{identified}} through seismic reflection methods. There are theories that Greenland {{consists of three}} large islands under the ice sheet, separated at the coast by three narrow straits, one of them Jakobshavn Glacier.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{report that}} {{a wide variety}} of {{microbial}} life exists in the <b>subglacial</b> Antarctic Lake Vostok, which has been buried in ice for around 15 million years. Samples of the lake's water obtained by drilling were found to contain traces of DNA from over 3,000 tiny organisms.|$|E
25|$|The seconed type of volcano-ice {{interaction}} is located {{only to the}} east, south and southwest of the Tanzilla Plateau, in the Cassiar Mountains, Skeena Mountains and in the Boundary Ranges. Volcanic activity in these locations is also largely mafic in composition, but the extensive elevations of these areas had a much more impressive influence on glaciation and <b>subglacial</b> volcanism. High altitude glaciation took over when the Cordilleran Ice Sheet was not present and even when buried by the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, basal ice movement was strongly influenced by the deep, pre-glacial drainages. Accordingly, the erosional remnants of <b>subglacial</b> volcanoes are minor and intermittent. In the Skeena Mountains, separated outcrops of pillow lava and volcanic breccia are generally found {{side by side on}} the summits of sharp rugged mountain ridges, with presumably temporally-associated pyroclastic rocks having collected downslope.|$|E
25|$|Slag Hill, another {{parasitic}} <b>subglacial</b> volcano {{located just}} north of Mount Cayley, was erupted during the Pleistocene period, producing glassy lava flows, such as augite-phyric basaltic andesite. These lava flows were cooled to form steep-sided, glassy, finely jointed lava domes comparable to those found at Ember Ridge, and one minor, flat-topped bluff.|$|E
25|$|Flow-dominated tuyas and {{the absence}} of <b>subglacial</b> fragmental {{deposits}} are two uncommon glaciovolcanic features in the Garibaldi chain. This is due to their different lava compositions and decline of direct lava-water contact during volcanic activity. The lava composition of these volcanic edifies changes their structure because eruption temperatures are lower than those associated with basaltic activity and lava containing silica increases thickness and glass differentiation temperatures. As a result, <b>subglacial</b> volcanoes that erupt silicic content melt less qualities of ice and are not as likely to contain water close to the volcanic vent. This forms volcanoes with structures that display their relationship with the regional glaciation. The surrounding landscape also changes the flow of meltwater, favouring lava to pond within valleys dominated by glacial ice. And if the edifice is eroded, it could change the prominence of fragmental glaciovolcanic deposits as well.|$|E
25|$|The geology of the Boeing Creek's {{watershed}} {{is dominated}} by sands, gravels, and silts created during the last glacial period. Materials present include <b>subglacial</b> tills made up of silt, sand, and gravel particles; advance outwash deposits, made up of well-sorted sands and gravels; and transitional beds, made up of compacted clay, silt, and sometimes sand.|$|E
25|$|Volcanology of Canada {{includes}} lava flows, lava plateaus, lava domes, cinder cones, stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, submarine volcanoes, calderas, diatremes, and maars, {{along with}} examples of more less common volcanic forms such as tuyas and <b>subglacial</b> mounds. It has a very complex volcanological history spanning from the Precambrian eon at least 3.11billion years ago when {{this part of the}} North American continent began to form.|$|E
25|$|Glaciers {{grow and}} shrink due both to natural {{variability}} and external forcings. Variability in temperature, precipitation, and englacial and <b>subglacial</b> hydrology can strongly determine {{the evolution of}} a glacier in a particular season. Therefore, one must average over a decadal or longer time-scale and/or over many individual glaciers to smooth out the local short-term variability and obtain a glacier history that is related to climate.|$|E
25|$|Robin Elizabeth Bell is a {{professor}} at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. She was influential in co-ordinating the 2007 International Polar Year and was the first woman to chair the National Academy of Sciences Polar Research Board. She has made numerous important discoveries with regard to <b>subglacial</b> lakes and ice sheet dynamics, and has a ridge, called Bell Buttress, in Antarctica named after her.|$|E
25|$|The overall flat-topped {{topography}} of Hoodoo Mountain led Canadian volcanologist Jack Souther to refer Hoodoo Mountain as a tuya, which are flat-topped, steep-sided <b>subglacial</b> volcanoes formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet. However, Hoodoo Mountain {{does not fit}} the normal tuya model because of its complex layering of rocks, although Hoodoo's unusual structure obviously results from frequent interactions between volcanic activity and Pleistocene ice sheets over the past 100,000years.|$|E
25|$|Lying {{just on the}} {{northern}} flank of Hoodoo Mountain is a small tuya known as Little Bear Mountain. This related Pleistocene age <b>subglacial</b> volcano consists of alkaline basalt and erupted mainly pyroclastic breccia with minor amounts of massive lava, pillow lava, volcanic sandstone and hyaloclastite. Cross-cutting veinlets of obsidian indicate these volcanics were formed by partial melting in the mantle beneath Little Bear Mountain. Mantle xenoliths found at Little Bear Mountain may have originated from mid-crustal depths.|$|E
25|$|As glaciers flow over bedrock, they soften {{and lift}} blocks of rock into the ice. This process, called plucking, {{is caused by}} <b>subglacial</b> water that penetrates {{fractures}} in the bedrock and subsequently freezes and expands. This expansion causes the ice {{to act as a}} lever that loosens the rock by lifting it. Thus, sediments of all sizes become part of the glacier's load. If a retreating glacier gains enough debris, it may become a rock glacier, like the Timpanogos Glacier in Utah.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the region}} around the Kishwaukee was shaped by glaciation. Glaciers left moraines, <b>subglacial</b> channels, terraces, outwash fans, valley train {{deposits}} and bedrock highs throughout the watershed. End moraines mark the western boundary of the Wisconsinian glaciation. Several natural areas and a quarry also highlight the geology of the watershed. The Flora Prairie Nature Preserve in Boone County has dolomite outcroppings and the Harvard West Geologic Area in McHenry County has an example of pitted outwash plain. The Harvard East Geologic Area has {{an example of a}} moraine protruding down a valley.|$|E
25|$|Northwest of Pail Dome lies a {{parasitic}} <b>subglacial</b> volcano called Cauldron Dome {{which also}} formed and last erupted during the Pleistocene period. It consists of coarsely lava flows, such as plagioclase-orthophyroxene-phyric andesite. Its total geomorphology {{is comparable to}} that of a tuya. However, any precise record of volcanic glass or fine-scale jointing has probably been worn away by erosion. Two compositionally identical lava flows spread to the southwest {{from the base of the}} volcano. It is likely that Cauldron Dome was formed subglacially and the associated lava flows were erupted within a meltwater conduit.|$|E
25|$|The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is a northwest-southeast {{trending}} volcanic {{chain in}} the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains that extends from Watts Point {{in the south}} to the Ha-Iltzuk Icefield in the north. This chain of volcanoes is located in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. It forms the northernmost segment of the Cascade Volcanic Arc, which includes Mount St. Helens and Mount Baker. Most volcanoes of the Garibaldi chain are dormant stratovolcanoes and <b>subglacial</b> volcanoes that have been eroded by glacial ice. Less common volcanic landforms include cinder cones, volcanic plugs, lava domes and calderas. These diverse formations were created by different styles of volcanic activity, including Peléan and Plinian eruptions.|$|E
