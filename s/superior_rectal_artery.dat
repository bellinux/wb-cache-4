Internal hemorrhoids are divided into four grades. Grade I hemorrhoids are composed of prominent vessels, without protrusion. Grade II hemorrhoids demonstrate prolapse upon straining, with spontaneous reduction. Grade III hemorrhoids demonstrate prolapse upon straining and require manual reduction. Grade IV hemorrhoids prolapse and cannot be manually reduced.|$|R

50|$|Transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (THD) uses a {{specially}} developed anoscope {{combined with a}} Doppler transducer to identify the hemorrhoidal arteries (originating from the <b>superior</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery)</b> 2-3 cm above the pectinate line. Once the superior rectal arteries are isolated with the doppler, a suture ligation is performed to effectively decrease the {{blood flow to the}} hemorrhoidal plexus. In case of redundant prolapse, the prolapsed mucosal membrane is lifted and sutured (with the last suture minimum 5 mm above the pectinate line), repositioning hemorrhoidal cushions in situ.This is different from a traditional hemorrhoidectomy, which focused on excising the hemorrhoidal bundle. In this procedure there is no tissue that is excised. Because the suture line is above the pectinate line, post-operative pain is minimized for patients. THD can be performed with conscious sedation, local or general anesthesia.|$|E

40|$|The fi rst {{step of the}} laparoscopic {{resection}} of {{the colon}} is dissection or embolisation of the artery leading to the tumor. There are dissections of the inferior mesenteric artery or <b>superior</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> during resection of the rectosigmoid colon. Methods During resection of the rectosigmoid colon we perform dissection or embolisation of the <b>superior</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> as the fi rst step. Than we resect the rectosigmoid colon. Results 74 procedures on the left colon and rectosigmoid colon were performed from January 1 st, 2002 to May 31 st, 2003 in the Hospital Podlesí. Complications included wound infections in 7 cases (9. 4 %) and failure of anastomosis in 2 cases (1. 5 %). The reason for this was ischaemia of the left colon during rectosigmoid resection. We had to perform a “second look ” revision and left colectomy with a terminal transversostomy. Conclusion Dissection or embolisation of the vessels leading to the tumor area {{is the first step}} during malignancies of the colon. In case of the rectosigmoid tumor it is the <b>superior</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> that has to be dissected or embolised. During strict dissection or embolisation of this artery ischaemia of the left colon with failure of the descendensrectal anastomosis occurred as a complication. Even a precise dissection of <b>superior</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> can lead to ischaemia of the left colon. The condition of vessels – especially connections between middle colic artery – left colic artery – <b>superior</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> is extremely important...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Colonoscopy is a well-accepted {{procedure}} applied {{worldwide in}} diagnosis {{and management of}} colon lesions. The incidence of reported complications is not rare.

He received computer tomogram and angiogram study to confirmed bleeder from right <b>superior</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> and subsequently managed with embolization and operation. Discussion: This is the second case report in the literatures of mesentery tear and the first case with massive hemoperitoneum.

40|$|A 79 -year-old male was {{transferred}} to the intensive care unit for postoperative respiratory support. An indwelling bowel management system was inserted for containment of noninfective diarrhoea. Following only 11 days of continual use the patient developed life-threatening rectal bleeding. Preoperative normal rectal mucosa and anatomy were documented. There was no evidence of postoperative coagulopathy. Mesenteric angiography identified bleeding from a branch of the <b>superior</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery.</b> Rectal mucosa pressure necrosis secondary to the indwelling Flexi-Seal � Fecal Management System was diagnosed. The patient required an 11 -unit transfusion of packed red cells. Following intraarterial coil embolization of the <b>superior</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> the bleeding abated.

40|$|Consensus {{does not}} exist {{on the level of}} {{arterial}} ligation in rectal cancer surgery. From oncologic considerations, many surgeons apply high tie arterial ligation (level of inferior mesenteric artery).

40|$|Purpose: Despite all {{developments}} in recent years, {{the choice of}} an adequate treatment for hemorrhoids remains a problem. Hemorrhoidal artery ligation and recto-anal repair (HAL-RAR) is a nonexcisional surgical technique {{for the treatment of}} hemorrhoids, consisting in the ligation of the distal branches of the <b>superior</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery,</b> resulting in a reduction of blood flow and decongestion of the hemorrhoidal plexus. The aim {{of this study was to}} present the early experience of treating hemorrhoids with HAL-RAR. Methods: Between December 2008 and November 2009, 70 consecutive patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids were treated with HAL-RAR. The patients underwent sonographic identification and suture ligation of 4 to 8 terminal branches of the <b>superior</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> above the dentate line. Results: There were 33 males and 37 females (mean age, 49. 72 ± 14. 1 years). The mean operative time was 43. 8 minutes (25 ∼ 80 min). Most patients (= 61, 87 %) were without any complaint upon follow-up at 1 week. Nine patients presented with early complication: isolated pain in 1, anemia in 1, isolated bleeding in 1, voiding difficulty (over 1 day) in 2 and tenesmus (over 2 weeks) in 4. Conclusion: Based on our results we may conclude that HAL-RAR is a minimally invasive, safe and effective method and may offer an important alternative for the treatment of hemorrhoids. It may offer minimall...|$|E

An emergency angiography revealed active bleeding from the stump of the <b>superior</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> communicating with the third portion of the duodenum. Complete obliteration of the stump by proximal coil embolization was performed to achieve successful hemostasis.

40|$|Among 244 {{patients}} who underwent potentially curative surgery with lateral pelvic node dissection for advanced lower rectal cancer, lateral nodal involvement (LNI) {{was observed in}} 41 patients (17 %), and 88 % of them had nodal involvement in the region along the internal iliac/pudendal artery or in the obturator region (“vulnerable field”). The cancer-related 5 -year survival rate of patients having LNI was 42 %; the therapeutic value of lateral dissection was much {{higher than that of}} lymphadenectomy of the <b>superior</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> (SRA) region. In terms of the prognostic benefit of lateral dissection, patients could be stratified most efficiently based on the nodal diameter in the “vulnerable” lateral regions...|$|E
50|$|The {{inferior}} vesical artery is {{a branch}} (direct or indirect) of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery.

The branches to the prostate communicate with the corresponding vessels of the opposite side.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} causes of local {{recurrence}} of rectal cancer is the regional lymphatic nodes metastasis. Existing methods of staging does not have absolute sensitivity and specificity with regard to lesion of regional lymphatic nodes in general, and of lateral group in particular. It is necessary to look for new methods of diagnosis, to identify risk factors and unfavorable prognosis of lateral metastasis in colorectal cancer, which will provide a more differentiated approach to the choice of treatment policy, indications for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and/or lymphatic node dissection. The work on {{the two groups of}} patients (control and basic) was performed on the basis of CT performed in angio mode and MRI investigated anatomical variability of middle <b>rectal</b> <b>arteries,</b> proved its impermanence, and studied the relationship between presence of the middle <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> and lesion of regional lymphatic nodes in rectal cancer.
