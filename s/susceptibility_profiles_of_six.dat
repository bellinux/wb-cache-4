40|$|Rapid {{identification}} and antimicrobial <b>susceptibility</b> <b>profiling</b> <b>of</b> the bacteria in blood cultures {{can result in}} clinical and financial benefits. Addition of saponin to the fluid from blood culture bottles promotes {{the recovery of the}} bacteria and thus may shorten the turnaround time of the microbiological analyses. In this study we compared the {{identification and}} <b>susceptibility</b> <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> saponin-treated and untreated (standard method) blood cultures monomicrobial for Gram-positive cocci using Vitek 2. We concordantly identified 49 (89 %) of 55 monobacterial cultures using the results with the standard method as reference. Complete categorical agreement between the <b>susceptibility</b> <b>profiles</b> with the new and the standard method was found for 26 (53 %) of 49 isolates, while discrepancies were seen for 23 (47 %) cultures. E-tests indicated that the new method resulted in a correct <b>susceptibility</b> <b>profile</b> for 8 (35 %) of these 23 blood cultures. Therefore, 34 (69 %) of 49 cultures showed a concordant/correct <b>susceptibility</b> <b>profile</b> for all antimicrobials with an overall error rate of 2. 3 %.

40|$|We used {{standardized}} methodologies {{to characterize}} Vibrio cholerae O 1 isolates from Guinea, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Togo, Côte d'Ivoire and Mozambique. We investigated 257 human isolates collected in 2010 to 2013. DRC isolates serotyped O 1 Inaba, while isolates {{from other countries}} serotyped O 1 Ogawa.

40|$|Some {{environmental}} Aspergillus spp. isolates {{have been}} described as resistant to antifungals, potentially causing an emerging medical problem. In the present work, the antifungal <b>susceptibility</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> 41 clinical and 134 environmental isolates of Aspergillus was determined using the CLSI microdilution method. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare environmental and clinical isolates with respect to their susceptibility, and assess the potential implications for therapy of isolates encountered in different environments. To our knowledge, this is the first report comparing antifungal <b>susceptibility</b> <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> Aspergillus collected from different environmental sources (poultries, swineries, beach sand, and hospital environment). Significant differences were found in the distribution of the different species sections for the different sources. Significant differences were also found in the <b>susceptibility</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> the different Aspergillus sections recovered from the various sources. Clear differences were found between the susceptibility of clinical and environmental isolates for caspofungin, amphotericin B and posaconazole, with clinical isolates showing overall greater susceptibility, except for caspofungin. In comparison to clinical isolates, hospital environmental isolates showed significantly less susceptibility to amphotericin B and posaconazole.

40|$|Periodontitis is a {{bacterial}} disease {{that can be}} treated with systemic antibiotics. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the antibiotic <b>susceptibility</b> <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> five periodontal pathogens to six commonly used antibiotics in periodontics. A total of 247 periodontal bacterial isolates were tested for susceptibility to the six antibiotics using the Etest method. MIC 50 and MIC 90 values (minimum inhibitory concentrations for 50 % and 90 % of the organisms, respectively) were calculated. Both European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints were used in the study to interpret results. beta-Lactamase production was tested when amoxicillin resistance was found. MIC 90 values of the anaerobic bacteria were all well below breakpoint values, except for three isolates of Prevotella intermedia and one isolate of Fusobacterium nucleatum that were resistant to amoxicillin (CLSI breakpoints); these isolates were beta-lactamase-positive. Two isolates of the capnophilic Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans appeared to be amoxicillin-resistant but failed to show beta-lactamase activity. Comparison with a previous study from The Netherlands showed minor differences in <b>susceptibility</b> <b>profiles,</b> but the MIC 90 values of A. actinomycetemcomitans for amoxicillin, clindamycin, azithromycin and tetracycline were higher.

In this study, the oral yeast colonization of PD patients and the antifungal <b>susceptibility</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> the isolated yeasts were accessed and correlated with fungal infection episodes {{in the following}} 4 years. Saliva yeast colonization was accessed in 21 PD patients and 27 healthy controls by growth in CHROMagar-Candida® and 18 S rRNA/ITS sequencing. PD patients presented a lower oral yeast prevalence when compared to controls, namely, Candida albicans. Other species were also isolated, Candida glabrata and Candida carpophila.

Infections caused by them are related to a specific form of growth - biofilm (BF), which has increased their resistance to antifungal treatment. Since bloodstream infections caused by non-albicans Candida species are increasing, it is important to focus on their susceptibility characteristics.
