5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and <b>shifting</b> <b>boards</b> had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E
50|$|On a ship, cargo must be stowed evenly so {{that the}} ship sits upright. All ships are {{vulnerable}} to cargo shifting, causing the ship to develop a list to one side. However sailing ships are particularly vulnerable because the ship naturally heels over {{in reaction to the}} force of the wind on the sails. If the cargo is not adequately secured the cargo may fall to the leeward side of the ship. Loose cargos (e.g. grain) flow downhill like water if not adequately secured (e.g. by <b>shifting</b> <b>boards)</b> and are particularly prone to shifting. If a large quantity of cargo shifts the ship may develop such a heavy list that she capsizes. A catastrophic cargo shift caused the loss of the tall ship Pamir in 1957.|$|E

40|$|The {{board of}} {{directors}} for the average firm underwent a significant transformation between 1999 and 2005 - {{not in terms of}} its size or the composition of its members, {{but in terms of the}} structure of its monitoring and investment operations. Over this time period, the operational form of the <b>board</b> <b>shifted</b> from a <b>board</b> structure where decisions regarding auditing, compensation, and the election of directors were made in the CEO’s presence, to a board structure where the CEO had been primarily excluded from the decision making process of the board. The fraction of time spent by outside directors apart from the CEO’s influence discussing nomination, audit, and compensation issues increased 200, 80, and 30 percent, respectively. Further, the CEO’s ability to avoid the oversight of outside directors and control the policy/investment decisions of the board through the executive committee was roughly cut in half over this period. In addition to these time trends, I explore the cross-sectional variation in the operational form of the board by testing and extending several hypotheses in the boards literature. First, in accordance with the scope of operations hypothesis, the fraction of time spent working outside the full board in committees is positively associated with firm complexity. Second, lending support to the negotiation hypothesis, CEOs with considerable power structure the monitoring operations of the board so that decisions are implemented in their presence, and outside directors rarely meet in non-management executive session...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{classical}} rook theory {{there is}} a fundamental relationship between the rook numbers and the hit numbers relative to any board. In that theory the k-th hit number of a board B can be interpreted as the number of permutations whose intersection with B is of size k. In the case of Ferrers boards there are q-analogues of the hit numbers and the rook numbers developed by A. M. Garsia and J. B. Remmel (1986, J. Combin. Theory, Ser. A 41, 246 – 275) M. Dworkin (1996, “Generalizations of Rook Polynomials,” Ph. D. Thesis, Brandeis University”; 1998, J. Combin. Theory, Ser. A 81, 149 – 175) and J. Haglund (1998, Adv. Appl. Math. 20, 450 – 487). In this paper we develop a rook theory appropriate for shifted partitions, where hit numbers can be interpreted as the number of perfect matchings in the complete graph whose intersection with the board is of size k. We show {{there is a}}lso analogous q-theory for the rook and hit numbers for these <b>shifted</b> Ferrers <b>boards...</b>|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{globalisation}} and liberalisation of financial markets, changing societal expectations and corporate governance scandals {{have increased the}} attention for the fiduciary duties of non-executive directors. In this context, recent corporate governance reform initiatives have emphasised the control task and independence of non-executive directors. However, {{little attention has been}} paid to their impact on the external and internal service tasks of non-executive directors. Therefore, this paper investigates how the service tasks of non-executive directors have evolved in the Netherlands. Data on corporate governance at the top- 100 listed companies in the Netherlands between 1997 and 2005 show that the emphasis on non-executive directors' external service task has shifted to their internal service task, i. e. from non-executive directors acting as boundary spanners to non-executive directors providing advice and counselling to executive directors. This <b>shift</b> in <b>board</b> responsibilities affects non-executive directors' ability to generate network benefits through board relationships and has implications for non-executive directors' functional requirements.
