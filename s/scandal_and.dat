5|$|The {{missiles}} were launched {{three days after}} Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky <b>scandal,</b> <b>and</b> some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing <b>scandal,</b> <b>and</b> 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.|$|E
5|$|One {{day after}} the report was released, Metropolitan Herman {{resigned}} from his position as Metropolitan. That November, the OCA elected a new Primate at its 15th Annual All-American Council. Metropolitan Jonah (Paffhausen) was chosen because he had recently been appointed as a bishop (only 11 days prior) and was viewed to not be involved with the previous financial scandal. Metropolitan Jonah immediately took a strong stance against the previous <b>scandal</b> <b>and</b> became a very public metropolitan, seeking to repair damage done by the previous <b>scandal</b> <b>and</b> bring the OCA into the public realm. Metropolitan Jonah also sought to improve relations with non-Orthodox groups and especially sought to repair {{the relations between the}} OCA and traditional Anglican groups. He was invited twice to speak at the conference of the Anglican Church of North America, in 2009 and 2012.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the episode}} {{primarily}} mocks the Republican Party, the writers included several jokes {{at the expense}} of the Democratic Party, liberal and conservative politics, to try to be as neutral as possible. Writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were very interested in the Watergate <b>scandal</b> <b>and</b> based a lot of the second act on that. Mark Kirkland directed the episode.|$|E
5|$|Another {{element in}} the {{ideology}} of the party was a populist fight against the political establishment, often manifested through political scandals which flourished in 1990s Belgium; including corruption, food and even pedophile scandals. These included the Agusta <b>scandal</b> <b>and</b> the Marc Dutroux affair. The usual suspects were politicians in the three traditional party families; especially the francophone parties.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} President Grant ran for reelection in 1872, Grant's {{administration}} had been rocked by <b>scandal,</b> <b>and</b> some disaffected {{members of his}} party formed the Liberal Republicans, naming Greeley as their candidate for president, a nomination soon joined in by the Democrats. Hay was unenthusiastic about the editor-turned-candidate, and in his editorials mostly took aim at Grant, who, despite the scandals, remained untarred, and who won a landslide victory in the election. Greeley died only weeks later, a broken man. Hay's stance endangered his hitherto sterling credentials in the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|California native Chris Carter {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to produce new shows for the Fox network in the early 1990s. Tired of the comedies he had been working on for Walt Disney Pictures, a report that 3.7 million Americans may have been abducted by aliens, the Watergate <b>scandal</b> <b>and</b> the 1970s horror series , triggered the idea for The X-Files. He wrote the pilot episode in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Gingrich {{and others}} in the House, {{including}} the newly minted Gang of Seven, railed against what they saw as ethical lapses during the nearly 40 years of Democratic control for almost 40 years. The House banking <b>scandal</b> <b>and</b> Congressional Post Office scandal were emblems of the exposed corruption. Gingrich himself was among members of the House who had written NSF checks on the House bank. He had overdrafts on twenty-two checks, including a $9,463 check to the Internal Revenue Service in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Kilroy made {{an issue}} of Pryce's {{knowledge}} of the Foley <b>scandal</b> <b>and</b> the need for Hastert to resign. Kilroy also linked her opponent to the unpopular Republican administration and congressional majority. After Foley resigned following the page scandal, Kilroy attacked Pryce with the conservative religious voters. Kilroy ran radio commercials on Christian and conservative radio stations {{in an attempt to}} appeal to family-values-oriented listeners.|$|E

5|$|Some protesters, {{commentators}} such as Libération correspondent Jean Quatremer and the Liège-based NGO Committee for the Abolition of the Third World Debt (CADTM) {{allege that}} the debt should be characterised as odious debt. The Greek documentary Debtocracy, {{and a book}} of the same title and content examine whether the recent Siemens <b>scandal</b> <b>and</b> uncommercial ECB loans which were conditional on the purchase of military aircraft and submarines are evidence that the loans amount to odious debt and that an audit would result in invalidation of {{a large amount of}} the debt.|$|E
5|$|The chanté mas (masquerade song) {{tradition}} is based around pre-calypso Carnival music {{performed in a}} responsorial style by partygoers.

5|$|A {{report by}} the Metro Council Rules Committee {{delivered}} in March stated that the granite's origin was discovered in early 1988, and was authorized by tunnel superintendent David Kalberer {{with the assumption that}} only a small amount would be used to furnish University Street station. Kalberer, who received praise for his work on the project before the scandal, admitted that the failure to consult the Metro Council's tunnel subcommittee before signing off on the deal was his mistake. Metro Director Alan Gibbs resigned on February 23 {{as a result of the}} <b>scandal</b> <b>and</b> was succeeded by technical director Richard Sandaas in September. The granite was rejected by Metro and was returned to the supplier in Italy.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Chapman {{played for}} a variety of clubs, at Football League and non-League levels. His record was {{generally}} unremarkable as a player; he made fewer than 40League appearances {{over the course of a}} decade and did not win any major honours. Instead, he found success as a manager, first at Northampton Town between 1908 and 1912, whom he led to a Southern League title. This attracted the attention of larger clubs and he moved to Leeds City, where he started to improve the team's fortunes before the First World War intervened. After the war ended, City were implicated in an illegal payments <b>scandal</b> <b>and</b> were eventually disbanded. Chapman was initially banned from football but successfully appealed. He took over at Huddersfield Town, winning an FA Cup and two First Division titles in the period of four years.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Assembly created a new, heavily Republican 6th District in Fulton and Cobb {{counties}} in the wealthy northern suburbs of Atlanta—-an area that Gingrich had never represented. Gingrich sold his home in Carrollton and moved to Marietta in the new 6th. His primary opponent, State Representative Herman Clark, made an issue out of Gingrich's 22 overdraft checks in the House Bank <b>Scandal,</b> <b>and</b> also criticized Gingrich for moving into the district. After a recount, Gingrich prevailed by 980 votes, with a 51% to 49% result. His winning the primary all but assured him of election in November. He was re-elected three times from this district against nominal Democratic opposition.|$|E
