40|$|The author {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} the radioactive thermal bath upon the carbohydrate metabolism and the leucocyte picture in alloxan-diabetic rabbits. 1. The author injected 100 - 200 mg. of alloxan per kg. of body weight intravenously into normal rabbits and produced alloxan diabetes. The triphasic blood sugar response to the injection of alloxan is illustrated in Table 1. and Fig. 1. About a week after the injection of alloxan, the fasting blood sugar values ranged 127 to 331 mg. /dl. (Table　 3.). 2. In this experiment the alloxan-diabetic rabbits were put in radioactive hot <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>plain</b> water bath, 42 - 44 ℃. in temperature. The radioactive hot springs put in use are "Hisui-no-Yu" and "Kenkyusho-sen" (the Loboratory-Spring), both in Misasa Spa, the chemical compositions of which are given in Table 2. 3. In any case, the blood sugar level rose temporarily after the thermal baths for 5 minutes, but the 24 -hour blood sugar value after taking a　bath was lower in "Hisui-no-Yu" (Rn: 300 - 400 Mache units) than in "Kenkyusho-sen" (Rn: 10 - 30 Mache units) (Table 3 and Fig. 2). 4. The glucose tolerance was found to be abnormal in alloxan-diabetic rabbits even 3 months after the injection of alloxan, but this abnormal carbohydrate metabolism tended to become normal by the radioactive thermal bath (Table 5, 6 and Fig. 3, 5.). 5. The radioactive thermal bath in "Hisui-no-Yu" caused increase of leucocyte counts of alloxan-diabetic rabbits more remarkably than the bath in "Kenkyusho-sen" (Table 8. and Fig. 6) ...|$|R

40|$|Key {{point of}} this thesis is the {{numerical}} investigation of the static and dynamic behaviour of an unfolded lightweight radarantenna, a so called gossamer structure. These structures are special deployable and lightweight for the use in space. They are constructed to unfold from a packed state for storage and transport into orbit to a deployed state for the use in orbit. This special an-tenna {{will be used for}} synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to monitor the earth and its activities, e. g. glacier movements, tectonic activities or changes in its vegetation. For this use, the antenna shall comply with very strict atness requirements after uncoiling from convoluted state. This project is currently carried out by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) at its laboratories in Brunswick, Germany. The unfolding process is very precarious for the structure. Therefore, the design has to avoid any possible damage to the structure resulting from the deployment. Dynamic problems were investigated to obtain the best possible structural damp-ing in a micro- to zero gravitation condition. Before any dynamical behaviour of the antenna could be investigated, the static behaviour has to be understood at _rst. This is necessary to determi-nate the forces in the frame around the heart of the antenna, which is formed by a multiple Kap-ton membrane layer. A planar and at state without any wrinkling in the Kapton membrane is vital for the function. After the static simulation of the stress conditions in the boom and membrane the dynamic behaviour can be simulated. Main part of the modelling was to _nd a suitable way to build up a _nite element model of shell and beam elements for the frame. Naturally they both have some restrictions in usage which can be eliminated via intelligent modelling. Another chal-lenge was to _nd a simple model for constant force <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> <b>plain</b> woven fabrics. All this work is discussed and evaluated {{at the end of this}} research project, due to its use as prediction for a 1 : 3 scale testmodell. This model will be used to evaluate the results of this numerical investigation under a one-g environment and to evaluate the general design and function of this concept...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{provides}} hydrochemical {{and stable}} isotope data and their interpretations for 54 <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> 20 wells, monitored from 2002 to 2006, in the Southern Latium region of Central Italy to identify flow paths, recharge areas and hydrochemical processes governing {{the evolution of}} groundwater in this region. The hydrogeological conceptual model of the carbonate aquifers of southern Latium was based on environmental isotopic and hydrochemical investigation techniques to characterize and model these aquifer systems {{with the aim of}} achieving proper management and protection of these important resources. Most of the spring samples, issuing from Lepini, Ausoni and Aurunci Mts., are characterized as Ca-Mg-HCO 3 water type, however, some samples show a composition of Na-Cl and mixed Ca-Na-HCO 3 -Cl waters. Groundwater samples from Pontina Plain are mostly characterized by Na-Cl and Ca-Cl type waters. Geochemical modeling and saturation index computation of the Lepini, Ausoni Aurunci <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> Pontina <b>Plain</b> wells shows an interaction with carbonate rocks. Most of the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> well water samples were saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite, however all sampled waters were undersaturated with respect to gypsum and halite. The relationship between δ 18 O and δ 2 H, for <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> well water samples, shows shifts of both the slope and the deuterium excess when compared to the world meteoric (WMWL) and central Italy meteoric (CIMWL) water lines. The deviation of data points from the meteoric lines can be attributed to evaporation both during the falling of the rain and by run-off on the ground surface before infiltration. Most <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> wells have a deuterium excess above 10 ‰ suggesting the precipitation in the groundwater comes from the Mediterranean sector. On the basis of local isotopic gradients, in combination with topographic and geologic criteria, four recharge areas were identified in the Aurunci Mountains. In Pontina Plain, the elevations of the recharging areas suggest that the Lepini carbonate aquifers are feeding them...|$|R
