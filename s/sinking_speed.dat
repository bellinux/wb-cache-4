50|$|During {{the early}} 1920s Farman entered Moustiques into several competitions. In August 1922 the first {{national}} French glider meeting, the Congrės expérimental d'aviation sans moteur, organised by the Association of French Flyers (AFF) and partly government-funded, was held in Combegrasse, Puy-de-Dôme. Farman entered two aircraft, the Aviette glider and a biplane (a de-motorised Farman FF 65); overall there were 17 contestants. The Aviette, piloted by Lois Bossoutrot, won several prizes in the competition between catapult-launched gliders, achieving the lowest <b>sinking</b> <b>speed,</b> the greatest altitude (80 m or 262 ft) and longest over-launch site duration of 3 min 30 s.

5000|$|The Royal Navy Type D {{depth charge}} was {{designated}} the [...] "Mark VII" [...] in 1939. Initial <b>sinking</b> <b>speed</b> was 7 ft/s with a terminal velocity of 9.9 ft/s {{at a depth}} of 250 ft if rolled off the stern, or upon water contact from a depth charge thrower. Cast iron weights of 150 lb were attached to the Mark VII at the end of 1940 to increase sinking velocity to 16.8 ft/s. New hydrostatic pistols increased the maximum detonation depth to 900 ft. The Mark VII's 290 lb amatol charge was estimated to be capable of splitting a 7/8 inch mm submarine pressure hull at a distance of 20 ft, and forcing the submarine to surface at twice that. The change of explosive to Torpex (or Minol) at the end of 1942 was estimated to increase those distances to 26 and 52 ft.|$|E

40|$|We {{show how}} to {{represent}} {{changes in the}} distribution of size and <b>sinking</b> <b>speed</b> of marine particles by a two-parameter model. In contrast to fully size-resolved models, this representation holds promise for constructing ocean biogeochemical models with detailed spatial resolution and seasonally varying <b>sinking</b> <b>speed.</b> We treat the mass and number of particles as separate state variables, each obeying its own conservation law. Average size and <b>sinking</b> <b>speed</b> of particles change as particles aggregate or the largest particles sink out. The distribution of particle sizes is assumed to follow a power law, whose exponent changes as a function of average particle size. Compared to biogeochemical models with constant particle <b>sinking</b> <b>speed,</b> our approach imposes a modest increase in computational cost and produces important effects like more rapid sinking immediately following a phytoplankton bloom. Compared to models that use hundreds of size classes to represent the detailed evolution of particle size distribution, our approach offers a major reduction in computational cost, while maintaining realistic behaviour like the sudden onset of significant aggregation when particles are sufficiently abundant...|$|E

40|$|The {{limitation}} of the 1929 contest to performance gliders necessitated {{the establishment of a}} formula which would make it possible to distinguish between performance gliders and school and training gliders. The <b>sinking</b> <b>speed</b> was therefore adopted as the basis for such a distinction, and the requirement was made that the <b>sinking</b> <b>speed</b> of a performance glider should not exceed 0. 8 m/s.

40|$|The most {{important}} factors in evaluating performance of gliders are minimum <b>sinking</b> <b>speed</b> and minimum gliding angle.

40|$|Ballast {{material}} (organic, opal, calcite, lithogenic) {{is suggested}} to affect <b>sinking</b> <b>speed</b> of aggregates in the ocean.

We show that calcite increases the sinking speeds of aggregates by ~ 100 % and lithogenic material by ~ 150 % while opal only has a minor effect.

40|$|The {{viscosity}} of {{the mantle}} is indispensable for predicting Earth's mechanical behavior at scales ranging from deep mantle material flow to local stress accumulation in earthquakes zones. But, mantle viscosity {{is not well}} determined. For the lower mantle, particularly, only few constraints result from elaborate high-pressure experiments (Karato, 2008) {{and a variety of}} viscosity depth profiles result from joint inversion of the geoid and postglacial rebound data (Forte and Mitrovica, 1996; Kaufmann and Lambeck, 2000; Mitrovica and Forte, 2004). Here, we use inferred lower-mantle <b>sinking</b> <b>speed</b> of lithosphere subduction remnants as a unique internal constraint on modeling the viscosity profile. This entails a series of elaborate dynamic subduction calculations spanning a range of viscosity profiles from which we select profiles that predict the inferred <b>sinking</b> <b>speed</b> of 12 ± 3 mm/yr (van der Meer et al., 2010). Our modeling shows that <b>sinking</b> <b>speed</b> is very sensitive to lower mantle viscosity. Good predictions of <b>sinking</b> <b>speed</b> are obtained for nearly constant lower mantle viscosity of about 3 - 4 × 10 22 Pas. Viscosity profiles incorporating a viscosity maximum in the deep lower mantle, as proposed in numerous studies, only lead to a good prediction in combination with a weak postperovskite layer {{at the bottom of the}} lower mantle, and only for a depth average viscosity of 5 × 10 22 Pas...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVarious {{functions}} {{have been}} suggested and applied to represent the sedimentation and remineralisation of particulate organic matter (POM) in numerical ocean models. Here we investigate some representations commonly used in large-scale biogeochemical models: a constant <b>sinking</b> <b>speed,</b> a <b>sinking</b> <b>speed</b> increasing with depth, a spectrum of particles with different size and different size-dependent sinking velocities, and a model that assumes a power law particle size distribution everywhere in the water column. The analysis is carried out for an idealised one-dimensional water column, under stationary boundary conditions for surface POM. It focuses on the intrinsic assumptions of the respective sedimentation function and their effect on POM mass, mass flux, and remineralisation profiles. A constant and uniform <b>sinking</b> <b>speed</b> does not appear appropriate for simulations exceeding a few decades, as the sedimentation profile is not consistent with observed profiles. A spectrum of size classes, together with size-dependent sinking and constant remineralisation, causes the <b>sinking</b> <b>speed</b> of total POM to increase with depth. This increase is not strictly linear with depth. Its particular form will further depend on the size distribution of the POM ensemble at the surface. Assuming a power law particle size spectrum at the surface, this model results in unimodal size distributions in the ocean interior. For the size-dependent sinking model, we present an analytic integral over depth and size that can explain regional variations of remineralisation length scales in response to regional patterns in trophodynamic state...|$|E

40|$|Gliding flight {{performance}} and wake topology {{of a common}} swift (Apus apus L.) were examined in a wind tunnel at speeds between 7 and 11 m s(- 1). The tunnel was tilted to simulate descending flight at different <b>sink</b> <b>speeds.</b> The swift varied its wingspan, wing area and tail span over the speed range. Wingspan decreased linearly with speed, whereas tail span decreased in a nonlinear manner. For each airspeed, the minimum glide angle was found. The corresponding <b>sink</b> <b>speeds</b> showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a minimum <b>sink</b> <b>speed</b> at 8. 1 m s(- 1) and a speed of best glide at 9. 4 m s(- 1). Lift-to-drag ratio was calculated for each airspeed and tilt angle combinations and the maximum for each speed showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a maximum of 12. 5 at an airspeed of 9. 5 m s(- 1). Wake was sampled in the transverse plane using stereo digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV).
