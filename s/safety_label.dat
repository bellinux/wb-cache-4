However, two large randomized controlled trials, specifically requested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act both demonstrated that imiquimod cream applied three times per week was no more effective than placebo cream for treating molluscum after 18 weeks of treatment in a total of 702 children aged 2–12 years.

40|$|Food safety {{incidents}} occur {{frequently in}} China. Chinese people 2 ̆ 7 s health {{is at risk}} due to the variety of Chinese food safety problems. The Chinese government has enacted many programs and policies to address this issue. The {{purpose of this study}} was to understand how Chinese college students perceive these food safety risks and what motivates them to take preventative measures toward reducing their risk. To better understand Chinese college students 2 ̆ 7 perception and their behavioral intention related to food safety, this study tested the relationships between threat appraisal (severity and vulnerability) of food safety and behavioral intention to read food-safety labels and buy food with food <b>safety</b> <b>labels,</b> coping appraisal (response efficacy and self-efficacy) and behavioral intention to read food-safety labels and buy food with food <b>safety</b> <b>labels</b> in Protection Motivation Theory. Chinese students in a large Midwestern university were recruited via an email invitation to take an online survey asking about their perception of food safety in China and their intentions to read food-safety labels and buy food with food <b>safety</b> <b>labels.</b> Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 22. 0. Positive relationships were detected between severity, vulnerability, response efficacy, self-efficacy and behavioral intention. Severity was the strongest factor (β=. 365, p 3 ̆c. 01) that influenced behavioral intention in this study after controlling for knowledge and mass media dependence. These outcomes suggested that Chinese college students 2 ̆ 7 intentions to read food-safety labels and buy food with food <b>safety</b> <b>labels</b> were increasing as their perception about food safety went up. Meanwhile, they were more likely to follow the recommendations to read food-safety labels and buy food with food <b>safety</b> <b>labels</b> when severity of food safety was stressed...|$|R

Results also show that preferences and WTP for safer foods are affected by demographic characteristics. For example, participants who had a high school education or less {{were willing to pay}} more for a food <b>safety</b> <b>label,</b> relative to those with higher educational backgrounds. We also found that some segments of consumers who chose the ground beef with a food <b>safety</b> <b>label,</b> such as natural food shoppers, were willing to pay a higher price for them, relative to shoppers in stores located in suburban neighborhoods. This suggests that having a good understanding of the demographic composition of the consumers that they target can help processors/retailers to more effectively use food labels to communicate food safety attributes.|$|E

30|$|To {{determine}} WTP {{premiums for}} the ground beef {{with the additional}} food <b>safety</b> <b>label,</b> participants who chose option B (the standard label plus the food <b>safety</b> <b>label)</b> answered follow-up questions using the double-bounded contingent valuation (DBCV) elicitation format which presented two random premium bid amounts, with the second bid contingent on the first, following Hanemann et al.

30|$|Among {{demographics}} variables, {{college was}} statistically significant in models I and III at the 10 % and 5 % level of significance, respectively. Remarkably, the coefficient of this variable is negative, suggesting that respondents with a college background or better were not {{willing to pay more}} for ground beef with a food <b>safety</b> <b>label.</b> Although this finding may require further investigation, the fact that more educated respondents would pay less does not necessarily indicate their aversion for the food <b>safety</b> <b>label</b> or the vaccine intervention. It could suggest that highly educated respondents were likely to be skeptical about the E. coli reduction claim from vaccine use on the food <b>safety</b> <b>label,</b> or the unsupported claim about enhanced safety from cattle raised under strict health standards, to warrant an extra cost to them. Strijbos et al. (2016) reported that among their sample of Dutch residents who participated in a study examining health claims of reduced nitrate levels in meat, those with relatively lower educational backgrounds were more likely to perceive such claims to be credible. The statistically significant income variable in models I and III indicates a higher WTP among respondents with high household incomes.|$|E
30|$|A {{chi-square}} {{test was used}} to test differences among the three options (i.e., option A, option B, will not purchase); the test result was significant at better than the 1 % level (Table  4), indicating that differences in response among the food safety labels were not due to chance. Key demographic characteristics such as household income, age, and education were not statistically different from each other among participants in the three food <b>safety</b> <b>label</b> groups (see tests in section B of the Appendix). Consequently, it can be concluded that a participant’s choice was influenced by the type of food <b>safety</b> <b>label</b> they were exposed to. Furthermore, the fact that the proportion of respondents who chose the not-purchase option was almost identical (approximately 15 %) for each group provides additional support to the robustness of the experimental design.|$|E
