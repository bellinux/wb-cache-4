Clinical audit {{is a way of}} fi nding out whether we are doing what we should be doing. It also verifi es whether we are applying the best practice. Methods An audit cycle involves <b>setting-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>standards,</b> measuring current practice, comparing results with stan-dards (criteria), changing practice and re-auditing to make sure practice has improved Results and interpretations A ‘clinical audit ’ is a quality improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and clinical outcomes through a systematic review of care against explicit criteria, and the implementation of change. Changes are implemented at an individual, team or service level and a subsequent re-audit is done to confi rm improve-ment in health care delivery.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the study focused especially on examining the effectiveness <b>of</b> technical <b>standards</b> {{in the field of}} municipal waste water systems with regard to imparting knowledge, possible simplification or obstruction of administration, influence on the market and competition. In addition, the economic effects (e. g. rationalisation effects, facilitation of innovative solutions or the entrenchment of suboptimal technologies, other impacts on production and transaction costs, influence on external effects) had to be critically analysed. The process <b>of</b> <b>setting-up</b> <b>standards</b> by private institutions as well as the impacts of the application <b>of</b> technical <b>standards</b> are examined. The process <b>of</b> <b>setting-up</b> <b>standards</b> was evaluated using the materials of standardisation institutions, relevant publications, discussions with experts and in depth interviews regarding 6 selected technical <b>standards.</b> The application <b>of</b> norms was examined in detail using 43 examples for the planning and realisation of sewing or waste water treatment plants. In spite of the deficiencies determined, overall, a positive effect <b>of</b> technical <b>standards</b> can be ascertained. (orig.)
