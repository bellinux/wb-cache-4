5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings {{from the early days}} of the war. Initially the targets were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims being killed by a firing squad. As this method proved too slow, the Einsatzkommandos began to take their victims out in larger groups and <b>shot</b> <b>them</b> next to, or even inside, mass graves that had been prepared. Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E
5|$|John James Audubon {{reported}} that the American white ibis was hunted and sold in Louisiana, and mainly eaten by American Indians. It had orange flesh and a strong fishy taste. Elsewhere, the flesh {{has been described as}} appealing on account of the crayfish diet, and both members of the genus Eudocimus have been hunted, which has been responsible for decline, across their range. Crawfish farmers in Louisiana have also <b>shot</b> <b>them</b> for foraging in crawfish ponds. Overall, the impact of hunting is not thought to be major.|$|E
5|$|From the 1950s onwards, {{stories about}} Brown were often {{included}} in local {{histories of the}} southeast of South Australia. Examples include Elma Smith's History of Kingston published in 1950, and Kingston Flashback written by local historian Verne McLaren and published in 1970. In Smith's version, the original crime was not discussed, and {{the focus was on}} the horse ride to Adelaide, and McLaren's account split the legend into two, one about a poisoning by Brown, and another in which Brown and an accomplice cornered Aboriginal people in the Papineau caves, smoked them out and <b>shot</b> <b>them.</b> The second of McLaren's stories ended with Brown's famous ride to Adelaide to report to the police. Another account was included in Barry Durman's A History of the Baker's Range Settlement, published in 1978. Durman reproduced a newspaper article about the investigation into Brown's involvement in the murders, passed over the manner by which the murders were carried out and stated that the case was not proven, and then told of a wonderful feat of horsemanship by Brown.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 26 October 1978, {{about a week after}} the {{extermination}} threat, George Burkitt and his 20-year-old son Philip were working on Philip's Triumph Spitfire car in front of their house. At around 7pm, annoyed by the noise they were making, Williams <b>shot</b> <b>them</b> both with a 9mm, Smith & Wesson automatic pistol. George died where he fell and Philip, wounded, ran into the house. Williams followed him, shooting him again and killing him. He then shot and killed George's wife, Iris. The Burkitts' 17-year-old daughter was hit four times in the back and once in the thigh, but survived. Two other neighbours, a married couple who had witnessed the attack on the Burkitts, also survived being shot. The injured were treated at Birmingham General Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Strong first-half play {{left the}} Buccaneers tied 7–7 with the Cleveland Browns at halftime, but {{they failed to}} {{maintain}} the intensity {{for the second half}} of the game. A screen pass from Steve Spurrier to Essex Johnson caught the blitzing Cleveland linebackers out of position for a 13-yard touchdown. The solid blocking of the first half gave way to the Cleveland rush in the second half, and Spurrier was replaced with Parnell Dickinson in the fourth quarter. Dickinson wound up leaving the game with a season-ending knee injury on a play in which he threw an interception to Terry Brown. Two Browns players were ejected for fighting, in a game in which several Buccaneers complained of cheap shots being taken. Dave Pear said, “If I had a gun, I would have <b>shot</b> <b>them</b> both in the head”, of two Cleveland players who tried to take out his knees.|$|E
5|$|The first {{incarnation}} {{of my life}} was as a ruthless killer. I still live {{with a sense of}} sin over those I killed.

I want to nurture kind and considerate hearts in all of them. Harada also traveled to the United Kingdom and United States to meet some of the American and British airmen he had fought against, including the American ace Joe Foss who {{is believed to have been}} the pilot who shot down his plane. As part of his travels Harada visited Santa Isabel Island, where he located the wreckage of his fighter and brought a section of it back to Japan.|$|E

5|$|While {{living in}} Vidal, Wyatt and Josie were visited by Billy Breakenridge, the former Tombstone deputy under John Behan. He pressed Wyatt for details about {{his time in}} Tombstone to add to his book Helldorado: Bringing Law to the Mesquite. Breakenridge was {{assisted}} by Western novelist William MacLeod Raine, who since 1904 had published more than 25 novels about Western history. The book was published in 1928 before Wyatt died. It depicted Wyatt as a thief, pimp, crooked gambler, and murderer. Breakenridge wrote that the Earps and Doc Holliday aggressively mistreated the guiltless cowboys until they were forced into a fatal confrontation. His description of the 1881 O.K. Corral gun fight stated that the Clanton and McLaury brothers were merely cowboys who had been unarmed and surrendered but the Earp brothers had <b>shot</b> <b>them</b> in cold blood. Wyatt and Josie protested that the book's contents was biased and more fiction than fact. Earp complained about the book {{until his death in}} 1929, and his wife continued in the same vein afterward.|$|E
5|$|Angola {{held the}} first round of its 1992 presidential {{election}} on 29–30 September. Dos Santos officially received 49.57% of the vote and Savimbi won 40.6%. As no candidate received 50% or more of the vote, election law dictated a second round of voting between the top two contenders. Savimbi, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said the election had been neither free nor fair. An official observer wrote that there was little UN supervision, that 500,000 UNITA voters were disenfranchised and that there were 100 clandestine polling stations. Savimbi sent Jeremias Chitunda, Vice President of UNITA, to Luanda to negotiate the terms of the second round. The election process broke down on 31 October, when government troops in Luanda attacked UNITA. Civilians, using guns they had received from police a few days earlier, conducted house-by-house raids with the Rapid Intervention Police, killing and detaining hundreds of UNITA supporters. The government took civilians in trucks to the Camama cemetery and Morro da Luz ravine, <b>shot</b> <b>them,</b> and buried them in mass graves. Assailants attacked Chitunda's convoy on 2 November, pulling him out of his car and shooting him and two others in their faces. The MPLA massacred over ten thousand UNITA and FNLA voters nationwide in a few days in what was known as the Halloween Massacre. Savimbi said the election had neither been free nor fair and refused to participate in the second round. He then proceeded to resume armed struggle against the MPLA.|$|E
5|$|Bows of {{any kind}} seldom survive in the archaeological record. Composite bows may have been invented first by the nomads of the Asiatic steppe, who may have based it on earlier Northern Asian {{laminated}} bows. However, archaeological investigation of the Asiatic steppe is still limited and patchy; literary records {{of any kind}} are late and scanty and seldom mention details of bows. There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at Krivoye Lake, part of the Sintashta culture about 2100–1700 BCE, but the bow that <b>shot</b> <b>them</b> has not survived. Other sites of the Sintashta culture have produced finds of horn and bone, interpreted as furniture (grips, arrow rests, bow ends, string loops) of bows; {{there is no indication}} that the bending parts of these bows included anything other than wood. These finds are associated with short arrows, 50–70cm long, and the bows themselves may have been correspondingly short. The Andronovo Culture, descendant of the Sintashta culture, was the first to extend from the Ural Mountains to Tian Shan, and its successor cultures gave rise to the Indo-Aryan migration. It has been suggested that the Srubna culture (contemporaneous with, and a neighbour to, the Andronovo culture) used composite bows, but no archaeological evidence is known.|$|E

5|$|In late 1942, the Germans {{consolidated}} {{some small}} ghettos in the Vilnius region with Gens' help. These included the ghettos at Oszmiana, Švenčionys, Soly, and Michaliszki. During {{one of these}} consolidations, on 25 October, Gens gave up 400 old people in return for saving the remaining 600 Jewish residents of Oszmiana. He bribed Martin Weiss, commander of the Ponary killing squad, to accept the lower quota. The Jewish police from Vilnius {{as well as some}} Lithuanians were forced to kill the 400 Jews. One ghetto diarist claimed that the Vilnius ghetto was outraged by Gens' participation in the killings, but other diarists stated that most ghetto inhabitants approved of Gens' choice to save some. By April 1943, most of these small ghettos were gone, with their inhabitants either moved to labor camps, shot, or moved to the Vilnius Ghetto. On 4–5 April, the last inhabitants were loaded into trains {{under the supervision of the}} Vilnius Jewish police, and the police accompanied the trains, which passed through Vilnius on their way to Ponary. Gens joined his policemen when the train went through Vilnius, and was arrested along with them when the train arrived at Ponary. Gens and the policemen were released, but the other Jews on the train were executed. It appears that the Germans misled Gens about the destination of the trains. Gens justified the participation of the Vilnius ghetto police in these roundups by claiming that their participation saved at least some of the ghetto residents, when otherwise the Germans would have <b>shot</b> <b>them</b> all.|$|E

25|$|On June 29 and June 30, 1941, {{there were}} random shootings of Jews in Liepāja by German soldiers. About 99 Jews (plus or minus 30) {{were killed in}} these shootings. Shootings began almost immediately. For example, at 5:00p.m. on June 29, {{arriving}} German soldiers seized 7 Jews and 22 Latvians and <b>shot</b> <b>them</b> at a bomb crater {{in the middle of}} Ulicha street. At 9:00p.m. the same day German soldiers came to Hika street, where they assembled all the residents and asked if any were refugees from Germany. One man, Walter (or Victor) Hahn, a conductor who had fled Vienna in 1938, stepped forward and was immediately shot. (Another source says that Hahn was killed by a mob of Latvians fomented by Nazis.) The next day, June 30, soldiers went to the City Hospital, arrested several Jewish physicians and patients, disregarded the protests of the Latvians on the hospital staff, and <b>shot</b> <b>them.</b> Among the victims was 10-year-old Masha Blumenau.|$|E
