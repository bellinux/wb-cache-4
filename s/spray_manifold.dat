Second, we deduce consequences on vector fields on the underlying manifold of a Finsler structure having {{one or two of}} the mentioned geometric properties...|$|E
40|$|Dust from worker,s clothes {{has been}} shown to be a {{problematic}} source of personal dust exposure. A recently completed effort between NIOSH and the Unimin Corporation has resulted in a quick and effective way to clean worker clothing. The process involves a booth under negative pressure with an air <b>spray</b> <b>manifold</b> to supply compressed air to blow off the dust from the clothing. The overall system is designed to meet MSHA and OSHA requirements. Results of field testing indicated that the manifold cleaned the clothes 10 times faster and removed 50 % more dust than cleaning methods used by workers today...|$|E
40|$|Automated {{spray guns}} {{are widely used}} in fully {{integrated}} pan-coating systems. Such pan-coating systems are used by the pharmaceutical/food industries to apply aqueous film, solvent and sugar coating for tablets, confectioneries, {{and a variety of}} other products. Typically, pan-coating systems are supplied from the equipment manufacturer fully configured for a desired application. The end user commonly makes necessary changes to the spray gun arrangement in order to accommodate a new application or a change in the coating formulation. Often, these changes do not produce the expected results due to a less than optimal spray gun configuration. Frequently an operator will change the gun operating conditions by simply varying the fluid and gas feeds. As a result, the spray pattern may deteriorate and drop size may increase beyond the desired size thus affecting the final product quality. A standard method for optimizing spray guns used in tablet coating applications does not exist at present. This paper proposes a method that includes an analysis of the critical elements of atomizer testing, consisting of layout and overlap optimization to reduce the errors commonly associated with <b>spray</b> <b>manifold</b> application, such as uneven spray distribution, heavy edges and poor overlap. Furthermore, this approach will also consider the effects of “normal ” operating parameters such as fluid flow rate, atomization pressure and gun-to-target distance on spray-pattern uniformity, drop size, and velocity...|$|E

Jet bundles are sometimes called sprays, although sprays usually refer more specifically to the associated vector field induced on the corresponding bundle (e.g., the geodesic <b>spray</b> on Finsler <b>manifolds.)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} the Zero-g Thermodynamic Venting System (TVS) performance prediction computer program. The zero-g TVS is {{a device that}} destratifies and rejects environmentally induced zero-g thermal gradients in the LH 2 storage transfer system. A recirculation pump and <b>spray</b> injection <b>manifold</b> recirculates liquid throughout {{the length of the}} tank thereby destratifying both the ullage gas and liquid bulk. Heat rejection is accomplished by the opening of the TVS control valve which allows a small flow rate to expand to a low pressure thereby producing a low temperature heat sink which is used to absorb heat from the recirculating liquid flow. The program was written in FORTRAN 77 language on the HP- 9000 and IBM PC computers. It can be run on various platforms with a FORTRAN compiler...|$|R

Soc. 2, pp. 851 - 897 (1989)). We prove that for every closed complex subvariety X_ 0 of X and for every continuous map f_ 0 from X to Y whose restriction to X_ 0 is holomorphic there exists a homotopy of maps f_t from X to Y whose restrictions to X_ 0 agree with f_ 0 and such that the map f_ 1 is holomorphic on X. We obtain analogous results for sections of holomorphic submersions with <b>sprays</b> over Stein <b>manifolds</b> or Stein spaces. Our results extend those of Grauert (Holomorphe Funktionen mit Werten in komplexen Lieschen Gruppen, Math.

40|$|In {{designing}} {{systems for}} the long-term storage of cryogens in low gravity space environments, one must consider the effects of thermal stratification on excessive tank pressure that will occur due to environmental heat leakage. During low gravity operations, a Thermodynamic Venting System (TVS) concept is expected to maintain tank pressure without propellant resettling. The TVS consists of a recirculation pump, Joule-Thomson (J-T) expansion valve, and a parallel flow concentric tube heat exchanger combined with a longitudinal spray bar. Using {{a small amount of}} liquid extracted by the pump and passing it though the J-T valve, then through the heat exchanger, the bulk liquid and ullage are cooled, resulting in lower tank pressure. A series of TVS tests were conducted at the Marshall Space Flight Center using liquid nitrogen as a liquid oxygen simulant. The tests were performed at fill levels of 90 %, 50 %, and 25 % with gaseous nitrogen and helium pressurants, and with a tank pressure control band of 7 kPa. A transient one-dimensional model of the TVS is used to analyze the data. The code is comprised of four models for the heat exchanger, the <b>spray</b> <b>manifold</b> and injector tubes, the recirculation pump, and the tank. The TVS model predicted ullage pressure and temperature and bulk liquid saturation pressure and temperature are compared with data. Details of predictions and comparisons with test data regarding pressure rise and collapse rates will be presented in the final paper...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that {{ventilation}} is a cost-effective method to lower respirable dust concentrations in all types of mining applications. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has been working on a number of different research techniques that use ventilation as a critical component to lower respirable dust levels at surface and metal/nonmetal operations in the United States. This article presents five such research efforts. The first research area discusses how improving the ventilation flow patterns in an iron ore mill facility lowered respirable dust concentrations by 31 pct throughout the primary grinding area. The second research area examines how respirable dust levels were lowered at a dimensional stone shop by using air cleaning units suspended from the ceiling. A third area discusses how improvements in ventilation at underground limestone mines lowered respirable dust concentrations. The fourth area examines how improvements in dust filtration and pressurization systems significantly impacted the air quality in enclosed cabs of surface mining equipment. The last area presents a newly developed clothes cleaning technique. This technique uses an air <b>spray</b> <b>manifold</b> to blow dust from a worker 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s clothing in an enclosed booth, which confines the dust for capture and removal by a baghouse dust collector. These research areas represent an array of different control technologies to lower respirable dust concentrations. Ventilation {{is an integral part of}} these control technologies...|$|E
40|$|A quick, safe, and {{effective}} method {{has been developed}} that allows workers to clean their dust laden work clothing periodically throughout the day. For the mining industry, this technique is much {{more effective than the}} current federally approved method of using a vacuuming system. This newly designed method is relatively inexpensive and can be easily installed at any operation to allow workers to clean their clothing without contaminating the worker, the work environment. or co-workers to elevated respirable dust levels. This clothes cleaning process uses an air <b>spray</b> <b>manifold</b> to blow dust from a worker's clothing in an enclosed booth, which combines the dust for capture and removal by a baghouse dust collector. Since the air exhausted by the dust collector causes the booth to be under negative pressure. no measurable quantities of dust were ever measure escaping from the booth to contaminate the work environment and/or other workers. The worker performing the cleaning process is required to wear a half-mask fit- tested respirator with an N 100 filter, hearing protection, and full seal goggles. Dust samples taken inside the respirator of test personnel performing the clothes cleaning process showed very minimal to no respirable dust. This clothes cleaning process was performed in less than 20 seconds and was significantly y cleaner than either the Federally approved method of vacuuming, or the most common method or using a single compressed air hose. It was also determined during this research that polyester-cotton blend coveralls clean more effectively than coveralls which are 100 percent cotton. The newly designed clothes cleaning process has potential application to any industry where workers' clothing becomes contaminated with most any type of dust or product...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} tests {{conducted at}} the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory on an "air-inducting" exhaust manifold for aircraft engines. The exhaust gases from each cylinder port are discharged into the throat of an exhaust pipe which has a frontal bellmouth. Cooling air is drawn into the pipe, where it surrounds and mixes with the exhaust gases. Temperatures of the manifold shell and of the exhaust gases were obtained in flight for both a conventional manifold and the air-inducting manifold. The air-inducting manifold was installed on an engine which was placed on a test stand. Different fuels were sprayed on and into the manifold {{to determine whether the}} use of this manifold reduced the fire hazard. The flight tests showed reductions in manifold temperatures of several hundred degrees, to values below the ignition point of aviation gasoline. On the test stand when the engine was run at idling speeds fuels <b>sprayed</b> into the <b>manifold</b> ignited. It is believed that at low engine speeds the fuel remained in the manifold long enough to become thoroughly heated, and was then ignited by the exhaust gas which had not mixed with cooling air. The use of the air-inducting exhaust manifold must reduce the fire hazard by virtue of its lower operating temperature, {{but it is not a}} completely satisfactory solution of the problem...|$|R
