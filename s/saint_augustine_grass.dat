40|$|A {{technique}} {{was developed to}} obtain bidirectional reflectance data from natural surfaces by using a folding mirror to transfer the reflected energy from the test surface to a spectroradiometer. The folding mirror was a first surface reflector made by stretching Mylar vacuum coated with aluminum over a light weight frame. The optically folding mirror was positioned over the test surfaces with a moveable platform for both laboratory and field tests. Field tests were conducted using a tethered balloon system to position the folding mirror. A spectroradiometer was designed and built specifically for this investigation. The spectroradiometer had an angular field of view of twenty-four minutes in one axis and ten minutes in the other axis. The radiometer was capable of detecting energies in small bandwidths throughout the electromagnetic spectrum from 0. 3 microns to 3. 0 microns. Bidirectional reflectance data and variations in the data with source angles were obtained for <b>Saint</b> <b>Augustine</b> <b>grass,</b> Bermuda grass, and a black alluvium soil from the Mississippi River delta...|$|E
40|$|Prescribed burning {{every two}} or more years is the {{recommended}} management practice to remove unnecessary invasive plants and to enhance the regrowth of desirable plants {{for the development of}} a fire-dependent plant community native to southwestern Louisiana. A portion of <b>Saint</b> <b>Augustine</b> <b>grass</b> lawn at Louisiana State University at Eunice (LSUE) was converted into a Cajun Prairie restoration plot in 1989. Since 1991, the adjacent lawn has been clipped weekly, whereas the prairie has been burned every January. The objective of this study was to determine the soil chemical properties of clipped lawn and burned prairie plots. Each plot (12 m x 104 m) had four blocks (replications). Soil samples from the 0 - 10 cm depth were taken from each block for each plot in December 2002, March 2003, and June 2003. They were analyzed in the laboratory for soil chemical properties: pH, organic carbon (OC), electrical conductivity (EC) as a measure of soluble salts, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu). Extractable soil P, Ca, Mg and Na were significantly greater in the burned prairie than in the clipped lawn. In the burned prairie from December to June, Fe increased, whereas pH, EC, P, K, Na, Cu, and Zn decreased. The results suggest that the annually burned restored Cajun Prairie provided greater nutrient deposition into the soil than the clipped Saint Augustine lawn...|$|E
