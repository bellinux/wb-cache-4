25|$|There {{are more}} characters, {{and three of}} them {{basically}} {{changed the course of}} British history. King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to be with an American woman, Wallis Simpson, and that's part of my story, so I've had to do an enormous amount of research and interview people. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> an enormous responsibility to that, and then I have a responsibility to the actual auction, which really happened. Then there's the new story, the point of view, which is this girl who has this obsession and is going to the auctions and stuff. So it's a much more layered, complicated piece than Filth and Wisdom.|$|E
25|$|I defend {{absolutely}} Mr Farage's {{right to}} disagree about the policy or {{institutions of the}} Union, but not to personally insult our guests in the European Parliament or the country from which they may come... I myself fought for free speech as the absolute cornerstone of a democratic society. But with freedom comes responsibility– in this case, to respect the dignity of others and of our institutions. I am disappointed by Mr Farage's behaviour, which sits ill with the great parliamentary tradition of his own country. I cannot accept this sort of behaviour in the European Parliament. I invited him to apologise, but he declined to do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> therefore– {{as an expression of}} the seriousness of the matter– rescinded his right to ten days' daily allowance as a Member.|$|E

25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E

Vitiligo or lighter skin?" [...] Noting that Jackson had even skin tone when he was younger, Lipkin's interpretation was that [...] "probably he's trying to look Caucasian: His skin is whiter. His nose is getting thinner every six months. His lips are getting thinner. His eyebrows are getting higher. His eyes are getting wider every time. His cheekbones are getting bigger." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1980s, many Japanese {{corporations}} {{relied on}} investments to bolster dwindling profits, particularly in its exports {{which had been}} eroded by a strong yen. Toshiro Shimoyama, Olympus president from 1984 to 1993, admitted to the Nikkei industrial daily newspaper in 1986: [...] "When the main business is struggling, we need to earn through zaitech" [...] (meaning [...] ). Olympus invested in financial derivatives and other risky investments to boost profits. However, Shimoyama said he [...] "does not remember" [...] any attempt to conceal losses (tobashi) during his tenure as president: [...] "As president it wasn't the case where all financial reports would come to me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no memory. During that time Masatoshi Kishimoto was the treasurer ... I wouldn't have heard financial details." [...] Kishimoto, Olympus president from 1993 to 2001, in turn denied involvement in tobashi, and instead suggested possible implication of Hideo Yamada, whom he said he supervised poorly.|$|E
500|$|His second {{defense was}} against Neil Sinclair in Yorkshire, Great Britain. In {{the first round}} Sinclair's {{offensive}} was effective and he scored a knockdown on the defending champion. On the second round Santos responded to Sinclair's strategy and won the fight by knockout. Prior to the fight Sinclair noted that a fight between Santos and him was supposed to happen eight years before, [...] "We were both in the 1992 World junior championships in Montreal. We were {{both at the same}} weight and were at other side of the draw from each other and ended up with bronze medals. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> watched him fight in person and shook hands on the podium. If we had both won our semi-finals we would have faced each other." [...] Sinclair also stated that he expected to win based on his training, he said that all of his sparring partners were southpaws since Santos is one, this preparation also included contracting a new trainer.|$|E

500|$|After {{appearing}} as a recurring guest {{actor in the}} fifth season, actor Jonathan Pryce was promoted to regular cast member for the sixth season. Prior to being cast as the High Sparrow, Pryce was approached to play another role {{in one of the}} previous seasons and refused the part. After being approached with the role of the High Sparrow, Pryce stated that he accepted the role because [...] "If the role hadn't been what {{it turned out to be}} for High Sparrow, I probably would not have been involved. I remember starting out and my agent said 'does the character change the situation or is he just a functionary' and this character changes the situation." [...] Pryce added, [...] "Once I started work on Games of Thrones I was incredibly impressed with the organization, the crew and they're really good at their job and story telling <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> become a fan of the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Sunderland lost 1–0 away to Manchester City on 5 November after a goal from Stephen Ireland. Manager, Roy Keane, {{expressed}} his frustration in a post match interview saying [...] "We didn't deserve anything. I don't feel we did {{enough to get}} {{anything out of the}} game. I don't think their keeper had too many saves to make, did he?". 10 November was the first Tyne–Wear derby of the season. Danny Higginbotham put Sunderland into the lead shortly after half time, but James Milner drew Newcastle level on the 68th minute after his cross beat goalkeeper Craig Gordon into the far post. Sunderland had a chance to win the game when ex-Newcastle forward Michael Chopra headed against the bar minutes from full-time. Sunderland ended the month on a low as they were beaten 7–1 away to Everton on 24 November. Dwight Yorke scored Sunderland's only goal just before half time. Roy Keane said [...] "It's hard to take, but we lose as a team and I picked the team and sorted the tactics <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no problem taking responsibility for what happened." ...|$|E
500|$|Åkerman {{was born}} in Sweden {{and grew up in}} Canada; she has [...] "conflicting feelings" [...] for the two countries.

I belong in both places and I love them both equally." [...] She holds both Swedish and Canadian passports. Apart from speaking fluent English and Swedish, she also speaks French and Spanish. She describes herself as a feminist as she believes in equal treatment for both sexes, but also considers that [...] "We [...] are different", adding that she [...] "embrace those differences." [...] She has revealed that she is dyslexic and said that it took her [...] "a long time" [...] to learn her lines. [...] "I get horrified when I have to do table reads with the whole cast, because there’s a lot of stuttering coming from me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{to do a lot of}} prep", she explained.

500|$|The six Flavas dolls, Kiyoni Brown, Happy D, Tika, Liam, P. Bo, and Tre, are {{ethnically diverse}} and portray Hispanic, {{black and white}} people. They have an urban {{sensibility}} and are dressed in hip hop fashions. Their accessories include ghetto blasters, cell phones, [...] "bling-bling" [...] jewellery and stick-on tattoos. The packaging, which doubles as a doll stand, is designed as a wall painted with graffiti. Instructions on the box say: [...] "Pull my street stand from the box, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a spot to hang out." [...] Newsweek described them as [...] "edgy" [...] and [...] "ghetto-fabulous". Marketed {{with a focus on}} self-expression and individuality, the Flavas dolls have more points of articulation than traditional fashion dolls. This allows for a wider range of posing and, according to Mattel, to express more [...] "attitude". Each doll has a unique face sculpt and a different height, ranging from 10inches to 11.5inches. They were each released in two different styles and each style was packaged with two different outfits. The complex jointing and individual molds made the Flavas dolls more difficult to manufacture than most other fashion dolls.|$|E
500|$|In a May 2015 interview, Frusciante {{said that}} he was {{finished}} with making music for public consumption, that he currently has no audience and {{in the past few years}} recorded music with no intention of ever releasing it. Frusciante said [...] "For the last year and a half I made the decision to stop making music for anybody and with no intention of releasing it, which is what I was doing between 2008 and 2012. I felt that if I took the public into consideration at all, I wasn’t going to grow and I wasn’t going to learn. Being an electronic musician meant I had to woodshed for a while, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a good few years worth of material from that period that’s never been released… At this point, I have no audience. I make tracks and I don’t finish them or send them to anybody, and consequently I get to live with the music. The music becomes the atmosphere that I’m living in. I either make really beautiful music that comes from classical, or I make music where the tempo is moving the whole time, and there’s no melodic or rhythmic center.” ...|$|E
500|$|When Tom is {{introduced}} in the first season finale, he wears a fake beard and old clothes. He continues to appear under this guise throughout the second season, only revealing his beard to be fake in the finale. M. C. Gainey, the actor who portrays Tom, was only informed that his character's beard was fake {{near the end of}} season two. The producers describe Tom as [...] "friendly", earning him the nickname [...] "Mr. Friendly". One critic has described him as [...] "sarcastic" [...] and [...] "bright". Tom's dislike of blood causes him to struggle while supervising Ben's operation, which Emerson believes makes him [...] "cuddly". Gainey does not think he is very similar to Tom, commenting, [...] "He seems to be very loyal and I'm a very loyal person <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> that in common, but other than that, I don't really know what he's about. He seems much more socially awkward than I am." [...] After Tom was revealed to be gay during season four, M. C. Gainey stated that [...] "anytime you've got a group of people, somebody's got to be marching to a different drummer- that would be Tom Friendly." ...|$|E
