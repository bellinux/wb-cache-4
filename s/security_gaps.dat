30|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a simple}} and practical security preprocessing scheme for the Gaussian wiretap channel. A <b>security</b> <b>gap</b> based error rate {{is used as a}} measure of security over the wire-tap channel. In previous works, information puncturing and scrambling schemes based on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes were employed to reduce the <b>security</b> <b>gap.</b> Unlike the previous works, our goal is to improve security performance by using the precode of the feed-forward (FF) structure. We demonstrate that the FF code has an advantage for the <b>security</b> <b>gap</b> compared to the perfect scrambling scheme. Furthermore, we propose the joint iterative decoding method between LDPC and FF codes to improve the reliability/security performances. The proposed joint iterative method is able to achieve outstanding performance by using the proposed scaling and correction factors based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) evolution. The improved performances by these factors are demonstrated through the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart and simulation results. Finally, the simulation results suggest that the proposed coding scheme is more effective than the conventional scrambling scheme.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the Gaussian wire-tap channel model, for which {{transmission}} security can be achieved only when Bob’s channel has a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than Eve’s channel [2]. As a metric for PLS, we use a parameter which allows for a straightforward assessment and comparison of practical transmission schemes, based on the error rate achieved by Bob and Eve. This parameter is the so-called <b>security</b> <b>gap,</b> first introduced in [3]. It is defined as the quality ratio between Bob’s and Eve’s channels that is required to achieve a sufficient level of PLS, while ensuring that Bob reliably receives the transmitted information. An analytical definition of the <b>security</b> <b>gap</b> will be given in Section 2.|$|R

50|$|In 2000, Touboul left Finjan {{to start}} Runway, Israel's first {{internet}} incubator, and Runway Telecom Partners, an Israeli telecommunications incubator co-founded with Alcatel. Alcatel invested $14 million in Runway Telecom in 2001. Also in 2001, Finjan encountered financial difficulties and Touboul {{returned to the}} company {{at the request of}} investor, David Cowan of Bessemer Venture Partners. As CEO of Finjan, Touboul often spoke about the risks of advanced spyware and the <b>security</b> <b>gaps</b> in programs and programming languages like JavaScript. He also invented new technologies including static and dynamic code behavior analysis and behavior based blocking technology. Touboul helped aggressively market Finjan's proactive defense technology and McAfee incorporated that technology into their products. Touboul also pushed for more funding. Finjan secured $8.5 million in funding from an investor group led by Benchmark Capital Israel, Israel Seed Partners, and Bessemer Venture Partners. This brought the total amount of funding to $31.5 million over the course of 6 years. Touboul helped Finjan earn an additional $10 million in funding in 2004 from investors including Cisco Systems, Bessemer Venture Partners, Israel Seed Partners, and Benchmark Capital.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, the <b>security</b> <b>gap</b> {{is first}} {{computed}} {{in the presence}} of thermal noise only, that is, over the flat additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and then also {{in the presence of}} fast fading (FF). We focus on state-of-the-art low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which are capacity-achieving codes under belief propagation (BP) iterative decoding [9], and have been shown to achieve astonishing performance over the wire-tap channel as well [4]. However, previous works in this line of research have mostly been focused on flat AWGN channels. In [3, 10, 11], {{it has been shown that}} an effective way of reducing the <b>security</b> <b>gap</b> consists in using punctured LDPC codes over these channels. On the other hand, the use of punctured codes brings the disadvantage of an increase in the power consumption. In some of our previous papers [12 – 14], we have demonstrated that similar, and even larger, reductions in the <b>security</b> <b>gap</b> can be achieved by using scrambled transmissions, and with considerable power saving with respect to punctured codes. A similar approach can also be used in the context of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, where less powerful convolutional codes are used in the place of LDPC codes [15]. More recently, the same strategies have also been extended to the Rayleigh fading channel [16] and to the broadcast channel with confidential messages [17, 18].|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, the {{relative}} {{behavior of the}} considered classes of codes basically depends on their inherent properties and is substantially the same for any considered scenario.
