5|$|During the night, the {{electrical}} power suddenly turned {{off and the}} radios went silent. Just before 11:30pm, a huge stream of water <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> Armero; it was powerful enough to flip cars and pick up people. A loud roar could be heard from the mountain, but the residents were panicked over what they {{believed to be a}} flood.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. was {{helpless}} in {{the next}} six months as the Japanese <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> the Western Pacific and into the Indian Ocean, rolling up the Philippines as well as the main British base at Singapore. After reeling from these defeats the Navy stabilized its lines in summer 1942.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the treacherous}} {{conditions}} in which this breed of dog was used, coupled with a succession of accidents, talk of the whole stock becoming extinct was raised as early as 1839. However at some point prior to 1847 a pestilence <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> the region and reduced the number down to a single specimen, which forced the canons into crossing it with other breeds.|$|E
5|$|From 5000 to 2000 BC, Bandkeramik {{cultures}} predominated. In addition, remains {{from the}} Dnieper-Donets culture {{were found in}} Belarus and parts of Ukraine. Cimmerians and other pastoralists roamed through the area by 1,000 BC, and by 500 AD, Slavs had taken up residence, which was circumscribed by the Scythians who roamed its outskirts. Invaders from Asia, among whom were the Huns and Avars, <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> c. 400–600 AD, but were unable to dislodge the Slavic presence.|$|E

6000|$|My nerves {{had hardly}} grown quiet after this affair {{when they got}} another shake-up--one which utterly {{unmanned}} me for a moment: a rumor <b>swept</b> suddenly <b>through</b> the camp {{that one of the}} barkeepers had fallen over a precipice! ...|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Paul {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} along its path through Baja California Sur. At least 85 homes in La Paz sustained damage, and many telephone {{lines in the}} region were down {{at the height of}} the storm. Wind gusts estimated at 120mph (195km/h) <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> San José del Cabo, causing property damage and subsequently leaving 9,000 homeless. Despite the damage, no deaths were reported in the wake of Paul.|$|E
5|$|In modern fiction, {{the vampire}} {{tends to be}} {{depicted}} as a suave, charismatic villain. Despite the general disbelief in vampiric entities, occasional sightings of vampires are reported. Vampire hunting societies still exist, but they are largely formed for social reasons. Allegations of vampire attacks <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> Malawi during late 2002 and early 2003, with mobs stoning one person to death and attacking at least four others, including Governor Eric Chiwaya, {{based on the belief}} that the government was colluding with vampires.|$|E
5|$|Long ago, King Childeric I came to {{the forest}} to build a city while the Queen experimented with black magic to gain eternal life. A plague <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> the land, and she hid in her tower, while her husband and {{everyone}} below her perished. Her spell granted her immortal life, but not the youth and beauty {{to go along with}} it. Her youthful appearance now only exists in her mirror, the source of her life, as an illusion and nothing more.|$|E
60|$|She <b>swept</b> away <b>through</b> {{the open}} window, {{and was at}} once {{followed}} by the Baron. Mademoiselle de Courcelles was playing very softly on a grand piano in an unseen corner of the apartment. Wrayson and his hostess were alone.|$|R

40|$|Summary. This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} pressure distributions obtained from theory and from wind-tunnel tests on two swept-back wings at various incidences and Mach numbers. The first wing, having NACA 65 A 004, sections had a taper ratio 0 " 2, an aspect ratio of 3, and had its quarter-chord line <b>swept</b> back <b>through</b> 45 deg. The second wing had RAE 102 sections, a taper ratio of 1 / 3, an aspect ratio of 2 ~/ 2, and had its semi-chord line <b>swept</b> back <b>through</b> 45 deg. The experimental flow conditions and patterns are presented in greater detail in Refs. 1 and 10, and are briefly discussed here insofar as they {{are relevant to the}} comparisons. 1. Introduction.

5|$|Terrified, the {{engineer}} {{jumps into the}} chemical plant's waste pound lock to escape Batman and is <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> a pipe leading to the outside. Once outside, he discovers to his horror that the chemicals have permanently bleached his skin chalk-white, stained his lips ruby-red and dyed his hair bright green. The engineer's disfigurement, compounded {{with the loss of}} his family, drives him completely insane and marks the birth of the Joker.|$|E
5|$|The Second World War {{broke out}} in September 1939 with the German Army's {{invasion}} of Poland. British assurances to the Poles led the British Empire to declare war on Germany. As in the First World War, a relatively-small BEF was sent to France and hastily evacuated from Dunkirk as the German forces <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> the Low Countries and across France in May 1940.|$|E
5|$|A {{disaster}} {{struck the}} colony on 13 August 2010, when a forest fire <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> the breeding site killing three adults and 25 of the 38 chicks. The fire destroyed the vegetation and several nesting burrows. Conservation action {{to protect the}} 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds and burnt vegetation, reinforcing the surviving nests, and setting poison bait for rats around the now exposed nest sites. In the longer term, the action plan includes the provision of artificial burrows, seed dispersal to help the vegetation recover, {{and the use of}} anti-erosion materials.|$|E

6000|$|As they journeyed along, {{the wind}} <b>swept</b> mournfully <b>through</b> the pines and pecans, but {{not once did}} they catch sight of any wild animal, outside of a few {{squirrels}} and hares.

5|$|A single soldier {{arriving}} in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and initiated the devastating plagues that <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> the native {{populations of the}} Americas. Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75% to 90% mortality. Maya written histories suggest that smallpox was rapidly transmitted throughout the Maya area {{the same year that}} it arrived in central Mexico. Among the most deadly diseases were the aforementioned smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis. Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33–50% {{of the population of the}} Maya highlands perished.|$|E
5|$|A single soldier {{arriving}} in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and thus initiated the devastating plagues that <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> the native {{populations of the}} Americas. The European diseases that ravaged the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas also severely affected the various Maya groups of Petén. It is estimated that there were approximately 30,000 Ch'ol and Ch’olti’ Maya in western Petén {{at the start of}} the 16th century. Between 1559 and 1721 they were devastated by a combination of disease, war and enforced relocations.|$|E
5|$|Following the duels, general {{engagement}} {{between the}} two armies commenced. Meccan confidence quickly began to dissolve as the Muslims <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> their ranks. The Meccan army was pushed back, and repeated attempts by its cavalry to overrun the left Muslim flank were negated by the Muslim archers. Enjoying {{the best of these}} early encounters, the Muslims pierced through the Meccan lines, with victory appearing certain. However, it was the detachment of the Muslim archers, disobeying Muhammad's strict orders to remain stationary, that would shift the outcome of the battle, as they ran downhill to join in the advance and despoil the Meccan camp, leaving the flank vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|Samori's {{campaign}} <b>swept</b> first <b>through</b> his neighbors, the Bérété and the Cissé, {{and then}} into the Wassoulou region (the border of today's Guinea and Mali). In 1876, he secured the Buré gold mines, and by 1878, his position was secure enough to officially declare himself faama (military leader) of a new Wassoulou Empire.|$|R
25|$|As British forces <b>swept</b> west <b>through</b> Libya and Anglo-American forces {{closed in}} from Algeria, the Axis began to pour {{reinforcements}} into Tunisia. A new command under Colonel General Jurgen von Arnim was set up, von Arnim was a confirmed enemy of Rommel, and so German command relations {{did not get}} off to a good start.|$|R
60|$|After {{that she}} had a hazy {{impression}} of streaming woods and flying belts of gloom as they <b>swept</b> down <b>through</b> the slack, until they drove out upon the tail-pool. For some minutes Thirlwell and the half-breeds battled with the eddies, and then they floated on smoothly and a light began to twinkle among the pines.|$|R
5|$|From Aquileia, Alboin {{took the}} Via Postumia and <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> Venetia, taking in rapid {{succession}} Tarvisium (Treviso), Vicentia (Vicenza), Verona, Brixia (Brescia) and Bergomum (Bergamo). The Lombards faced difficulties only in taking Opitergium (Oderzo), which Alboin decided to avoid, as he similarly avoided tackling the main Venetian towns closer to the coast on the Via Annia, such as Altinum, Patavium (Padova), Mons Silicis (Monselice), Mantua and Cremona. The invasion of Venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil, spurring waves of refugees from the Lombard-controlled interior to the Byzantine-held coast, often led by their bishops, and resulting in new settlements such as Torcello and Heraclia.|$|E
5|$|In 1519 and 1520, {{before the}} arrival of the Spanish in the region, a number of {{epidemics}} <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> southern Guatemala. At {{the same time as the}} Spanish were occupied with the overthrow of the Aztec empire, a devastating plague struck the Kaqchikel capital of Iximche, and the city of Q'umarkaj, capital of the K'iche', may also have suffered from the same epidemic. It is likely that the same combination of smallpox and a pulmonary plague swept across the entire Guatemalan Highlands. Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33–50% of the population of the highlands perished. Population levels in the Guatemalan Highlands did not recover to their pre-conquest levels until the middle of the 20th century. In 1666 pestilence or murine typhus <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> what is now the department of Huehuetenango. Smallpox was reported in San Pedro Saloma, in 1795. At the time of the fall of Nojpetén in 1697, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 floods <b>swept</b> <b>through</b> the Columbia watershed, {{destroying}} Vanport, {{then the}} second largest city in Oregon, and impacting cities {{as far north as}} Trail, British Columbia. The flooding prompted the United States Congress to pass the Flood Control Act of 1950, authorizing the federal development of additional dams and other flood control mechanisms. By that time local communities had become wary of federal hydroelectric projects, and sought local control of new developments; a public utility district in Grant County, Washington, ultimately began construction of the dam at Priest Rapids.|$|E
