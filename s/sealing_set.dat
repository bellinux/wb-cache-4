50|$|It was {{not until}} November 1923 when the {{government}} finally gave its approval {{for a number of}} officially recognised medium wave stations.All stations operated under a unique <b>Sealed</b> <b>Set</b> system under which each <b>set</b> was <b>sealed</b> to the frequency of one station. Part of the price of the set went to the government via the Postmaster-General's Department (PMG), with money also going to the broadcaster. Apart from extremely limited advertising, this was the broadcasters' only source of income. From the outset problems with the system came to the fore. Many young people built their own sets, which could receive all the stations. The <b>sealed</b> <b>set</b> system was devised by broadcasting pioneer Ernest Fisk of AWA - Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia).|$|R

Albert & Sons (music publishers and retailers). A number of B Class stations were also licensed. These did not receive any government monies and were expected to derive their income from advertising, sponsorship, or other sources. Within a few years B Class stations were being referred to as [...] "commercial stations".|$|R

50|$|According to Nicephorus Callistus Xanthopoulos, on {{the death}} of Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople, the emperor Zeno placed on the altar of the great church of Constantinople two sheets of paper. On one was written a prayer that God would send an angel to inscribe on the blank sheet the name of him whom He wished to be the patriarch. A fast of 40 days with prayer was ordered. The church was given into the custody of a {{confidential}} eunuch, the imperial chamberlain, and the imperial <b>seal</b> <b>set</b> on the casket containing the papers.|$|R

5000|$|Egyptologists such as Nicolas Grimal, Wolfgang Helck and Walter Bryan Emery {{identify}} Weneg with king Sekhemib-Perenmaat {{and with}} the Ramesside royal cartouche-name Wadjenes. Their theory {{is based on the}} assumption that Sekhemib and Seth-Peribsen were different rulers and that both were the immediate successors of king Ninetjer. But this theory is not commonly accepted, because clay seals of Sekhemib were found in the tomb of king Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of 2nd dynasty. The clay <b>seals</b> <b>set</b> Sekhemib's reign close to Khasekhemwy's, whilst the Ramesside name [...] "Wadjenes" [...] is placed near the beginning of 2nd dynasty.|$|R

25|$|The mild {{climate of}} the West Coast, {{especially}} California, allowed the league to play longer seasons, sometimes starting in late February and ending {{as late as the}} beginning of December. During the 1905 season the San Francisco <b>Seals</b> <b>set</b> the all-time PCL record by playing 230 games. Teams regularly played between 170 and 200 games in a season until the late 1950s. This allowed players, who were often career minor leaguers, to hone their skills, earn an extra month or two of pay, and reduce the need to find off-season work. These longer seasons gave owners the opportunity to generate more revenue. Another outcome was that a number of the all-time minor league records for season statistical totals are held by players from the PCL.|$|R
40|$|The {{exponential}} growth of World Wide Web poses many challenges for web {{researchers in the}} process of extracting qualitative knowledge. Many modern knowledge acquisition approaches exploit the redundancy of the Web to extract semantic information. In this paper, we propose a statistics based method of finding a set of semantically related terms, given a small set of seed items. We used an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for unsupervised learning to extract semantic clusters by making use of redundant information available in the web pages. We evaluated and compared our results with similar applications, Google <b>sets</b> and <b>SEAL</b> (<b>set</b> expander for any language). We also present a method for labeling the sets or clusters extracted from the Web given the seed terms. Labels are useful for building the concept taxonomies...|$|R

40|$|Containment {{structures}} for nuclear reactors are the final barrier between released radionuclides and the public. Containment structures are constructed from steel, reinforced concrete, or prestressed concrete. US nuclear reactor containment geometries {{tend to be}} cylindrical with elliptical or hemispherical heads. The older Soviet designed reactors do not use a containment building to mitigate the effects of accidents. Instead, they employ a <b>sealed</b> <b>set</b> of rectilinear, interconnected compartments, collectively called the accident localization system (ALS), to reduce the release of radionuclides to the atmosphere during accidents. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a methodology that can be used to find the structural capacity of reinforced concrete structures.

In this paper, we illustrated in detail the construction of character-level wrappers for set expansion implemented in SEAL. We also evaluated several kinds of wrappers for set expansion and showed that character-based wrappers perform better than HTML-based wrappers. In addition, we demonstrated a technique that extends SEAL to learn binary relational concepts (e. g., “x is {{the mayor of the}} city y”) from only two seeds. We also show that the extended SEAL has good performance on our evaluation datasets, which includes English and Chinese, thus demonstrating language-independence. ...|$|R

One system that does <b>set</b> expansion is <b>SEAL</b> (<b>Set</b> Expander for Any Language), which expands entities automatically by utilizing resources from the Web in a language independent fashion. In a previous study, <b>SEAL</b> showed good <b>set</b> expansion performance using three seed entities; however, when given a larger set of seeds (e. g., ten), SEAL’s expansion method performs poorly. In this paper, we present Iterative SEAL (iSEAL), which allows a user to provide many seeds. Briefly, iSEAL makes several calls to SEAL, each call using {{a small number of}} seeds. We also show that iSEAL {{can be used in a}} “bootstrapping” manner, where each call to SEAL uses a mixture of user-provided and self-generated seeds. We show that the bootstrapping version of iSEAL obtains better results than SEAL even when using fewer user-provided seeds. In addition, we compare the performance of various ranking algorithms used in iSEAL, and show that the choice of ranking method has a small effect on performance when all seeds are user-provided, but a large effect when iSEAL is bootstrapped. In particular, we show that Random Walk with Restart is nearly as good as Bayesian Sets with userprovided seeds, and performs best with bootstrapped seeds. 1...|$|R
