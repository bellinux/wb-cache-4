5000|$|Longlining - is a {{commercial}} technique {{that uses a}} long heavy fishing line {{with a series of}} hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called [...] "snoods". Longlines are usually operated from <b>specialised</b> <b>boats</b> called longliners. They use a special winch to haul in the line, and can operate in deeper waters targeting pelagic species such as swordfish, tuna, halibut and sablefish.|$|E
50|$|The {{village is}} popular for sail & motor boating, and Horning Sailing Club hosts regular annual events. Several boatyards <b>specialise</b> in <b>boat</b> sales, boat hire, boat {{building}} and repairs. There are two marinas which offer private mooring facilities. The River Bure is navigable from the North Sea at Great Yarmouth {{all the way}} to Horning.|$|R
50|$|In 1879 Englishman John Eager {{became the}} company head designer. He was <b>specialised</b> on fast <b>boats</b> and {{designed}} {{a number of}} new vessel types, such as torpedo boats, gunboats and tanker ships.|$|R
50|$|John Lambert (1937-January 11, 2016) was a naval {{illustrator}} and historian. He <b>specialised</b> in naval <b>boats</b> up to destroyer size. The {{information he}} presented and his detailed drawings of warships and their weapons systems are referenced from official naval and shipbuilder sources.|$|R
5000|$|Boat anglers - Fishing {{is usually}} done either from a boat {{or from a}} {{shoreline}} or river bank. When fishing from a boat, pretty much any fishing technique can be used, from nets to fish traps, but some form of angling {{is by far the}} most common. Compared to fishing from the land, fishing from a boat allows more access to different fishing grounds and different species of fish. Some tackle is <b>specialised</b> for <b>boat</b> anglers, such as sea rods.|$|R
25|$|A Bristol Channel pilot cutter is a <b>specialised</b> sailing <b>boat</b> {{the style}} and design of which {{is derived from the}} single-masted cutter. Based upon bulkier, less nimble, fishing boats but {{modified}} for use in the strong tides, winds, currents and coastline of the Bristol Channel its purpose was to quickly ferry local maritime pilots to and from large ships to assist in safe navigation into or out of any of the port cities in the Channel. The speed and manoeuvrability of the cutters allowed a minimal crew, in almost any weather, to quickly arrive at and easily lie alongside larger ships for easy and safe transfer of pilots. The craft was also equipped to stay 'on station' for days or even weeks, awaiting arrivals just outside the channel.|$|R
2500|$|Dive boats {{may simply}} {{transport}} divers and their equipment {{to and from}} the dive site for a single dive, or may provide longer term support and shelter for day trips or periods of several consecutive days. Deployment of divers may be while moored, at anchor, or under way, (also known as [...] or live-boat diving). There are a range of <b>specialised</b> procedures for <b>boat</b> diving, which include water entry and exit, avoiding injury by the dive boat, and keeping the dive boat crew aware of the location of the divers in the water.|$|R
40|$|Thomas Risby {{arrived in}} Van Dieman's Land from Norfolk Island in 1808. He {{was a master}} <b>boat</b> builder, <b>specialising</b> in whale <b>boats</b> and his sons joined him in the {{business}}. In 1844 one of tne sons, Joseph Edward Risby, went into the timber business and established an office and sawmill {{at the corner of}} Elizabeth and Davey Streets close to Franklin Wharf. The mill was known as 'The Franklin Wharf Steam Saw and Bark Mills'. In 1878 this mill was burnt down, but was rebuilt and enlarged. Collection holds diaries, various photographs and an account ledger...|$|R
50|$|The first <b>boat</b> <b>specialised</b> as a {{lifeboat}} {{was tested}} on the River Tyne in England on January 29, 1790, built by Henry Greathead. The design won a competition organised {{by the private}} Law House committee, though William Wouldhave and Lionel Lukin both {{claimed to be the}} inventor of the first lifeboat. Greathead's boat, the Original (combined with some features of Wouldhave's) entered service in 1790 and another 31 of the same design were constructed. The 28 ft boat was rowed by up to 12 crew for whom cork jackets were provided. In 1807 Ludkin designed the Frances Ann for the Lowestoft service, which wasn't satisfied with Greathead's design, and this saved 300 lives over 42 years of service.|$|R
50|$|He {{purchased}} {{several small}} plots {{of land in}} Chingford, built a hut and swimming pool there, and visited frequently. The hut was removed in 1930 when the Chingford Urban District Council acquired the land. The hut {{was given to the}} City of London Corporation, which re-erected it in the grounds of The Warren, Loughton, where it remains (neglected) today. Lawrence's tenure of the Chingford land has now been commemorated by a plaque fixed on the sighting obelisk on Pole Hill.Lawrence continued serving in the RAF based at RAF Mount Batten near Plymouth, RAF Calshot, near Southampton, and Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire, <b>specialising</b> in high-speed <b>boats</b> and professing happiness, and it was with considerable regret that he left the service {{at the end of his}} enlistment in March 1935.|$|R
50|$|Maritime Archaeology {{emerged in}} Australia {{commenced}} in the 1970s {{with the advent}} of Jeremy Green due to concerns expressed by academics and politicians with the rampant destruction of the Dutch and British East India ships lost on the west coast. As Commonwealth legislation was enacted and enforced after 1976 and as States enacted their own legislation the sub-discipline spread throughout Australia concentrating initially on shipwrecks due to on-going funding by both the States and the Commonwealth under their shipwreck legislation. Studies now include as an element of underwater archaeology, as a whole, the study of submerged indigenous sites. Nautical Archaeology, (the <b>specialised</b> study of <b>boat</b> and ship construction) is also practised in the region. Often the sites or relics studied in Australia as {{in the rest of the}} world are not inundated. The study of historic submerged aircraft, better known as a sub-discipline of aviation archaeology, underwater aviation archaeology is also practised in the region. In some states maritime and underwater archaeology is practised out of Museums and in others out of cultural heritage management units and all practitioners operate under the aegis of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology (AIMA).|$|R

50|$|Underwater {{archaeology}} is archaeology practised in a submerged environment. It {{encompasses the}} pre-historic and historic eras. Maritime archaeology (the study {{of humans and}} their activities in, on, around and under the seas, rivers and estuaries) and Nautical archaeology, (the <b>specialised</b> study of <b>boat</b> and ship construction) are allied sub-disciplines of archaeology as a whole. Often the sites or relics are not inundated, however. Of late these various studies have progressed into the industrial and post-war eras. In mirroring their terrestrial roots, underwater archaeology, maritime and nautical archaeology can now include the examination {{of a wide range}} of sites ranging from the indigenous through to industrial archaeology and of late the study of wartime and post-war sites, including historic submerged aircraft. Better known as a sub-discipline of aviation archaeology, underwater aviation archaeology is arguably the most recent offshoot of underwater archaeology, having developed its theoretical underpinnings and a substantial corpus of fieldwork, research and publication work in the late 1990s. Maritime archaeology, the first of these sub-disciplines to emerge in Australia, commenced under the aegis of Jeremy Green in the 1970s after concerns were expressed by academics and politicians over the rampant destruction of Dutch and British East Indian ships lost on the west coast. After Commonwealth legislation was enacted and enforced after 1976 and the States enacted their own legislation the sub-discipline spread throughout Australia, as a result of on-going funding by both the States and the Commonwealth. While also encompassing the study of port-related structures (e.g. jetties, anchorages), lighthouses, moorings, defences etc., initially the focus in maritime archaeology was solely on shipwrecks. Now far broader in its scope, in some states maritime and underwater archaeology is managed by museums and in others by cultural heritage management units. There are also numerous practitioners in private practice, or acting as consultants. Regardless, all practitioners operate under the aegis of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology (AIMA).|$|R
