5|$|On September 6, 1966, after {{over twenty}} years of cosignage, SH-32 was {{truncated}} to its current western terminus in Ryan. Everything west of Waurika was now solely US-70. After the truncation of 1966, SH-32 had the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> that it does today.|$|E
5|$|Paddington is the London {{terminus}} for long-distance high-speed trains {{operated by}} Great Western Railway. Two services go to Heathrow Airport: the Heathrow Express travels non-stop {{at a premium}} fare, while Heathrow Connect takes the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> but calls at most intermediate stations.|$|E
5|$|Every June, the {{mountain}} {{is the site}} of the Mount Washington Road Race, an event which attracts hundreds of runners. In August the Mount Washington Auto Road Bicycle Hillclimb, a bicycle race, takes place along the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> as the road race. The hillclimb's notable contestants include former Tour de France contender Tyler Hamilton.|$|E
5000|$|CR 61 was {{authorized}} and paved during the 1960s, making an alternate route for nearby I-494, intersecting {{with many of}} the <b>same</b> <b>routes</b> route I-494 did, such as I-94, MN 7, MN 55, MN 62, CR 9, CR 10, CR 5 and several others, in the western suburbs of the Twin Cities.|$|R
5|$|An {{international}} Nightstar sleeper {{train was}} also planned; {{this would have}} travelled the <b>same</b> <b>routes</b> as Regional Eurostar, plus the Great Western Main Line to Cardiff.|$|R
50|$|VANZ Auckland and Christchurch based {{pilots and}} cabin crew {{continue}} {{to fly the}} <b>same</b> <b>routes</b> {{and some of the}} same aircraft under the Virgin Australia International Airlines air operator certificate.|$|R
5|$|Highway127 was {{designated}} in late 1955, generally following the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> as today, {{with the exception}} of the northern terminus. During the early 1960s, a new road was constructed east of Whitney, bypassing the old highway for several kilometres. By 1963, the bypass was complete and Highway127 was rerouted onto it.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the route}} {{began at the}} {{intersection}} of Queen Street and King Street in downtown Kitchener, and proceeded north along King Street through Waterloo and St.Jacobs. North of St. Jacobs, the highway followed the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> as modern Waterloo Regional Road85 to Elmira, ending at Church Street.|$|E
5|$|On weekdays {{other than}} Wednesdays, Nefyn Coaches service 334 runs a morning Rhydlios–Porth Or–Uwchmynydd–Aberdaron–Penygroeslon–Llangwnnadl–Tudweiliog–Nefyn route. A second journey at midday {{operates}} from Uwchmynydd over the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> to Nefyn, {{and on to}} Pwllheli. Each weekday, an early evening bus runs the Penygroeslon–Rhydlios–Porth Or–Uwchmynydd route, while on Wednesdays during school holidays an afternoon Rhydlios–Botwnnog–Mynytho–Llanbedrog–Pwllheli bus runs.|$|E
50|$|Where {{lines were}} {{closed in the}} 1940s and 1950s, or {{passenger}} services discontinued, road bus services were introduced. Most of the services and the <b>same</b> <b>routes</b> continue to the present.|$|R
50|$|Route 113 is a {{particularly}} notable route as it ran over exactly the <b>same</b> <b>routeing</b> between Edgware and Oxford Circus for over 70 years, from before World War II until 6 November 2009.|$|R
50|$|Hourly {{services}} {{operate on}} the Bernina Line at Tirano. On top of regional services between St. Moritz and Davos, four Bernina Express daily tourist trains, two in each direction, {{operate on the}} <b>same</b> <b>routes.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Mormon Trail {{extends from}} Nauvoo, Illinois, {{which was the}} {{principal}} settlement of the Latter Day Saints from 1839 to 1846, to Salt Lake City, Utah, which was settled by Brigham Young and his followers beginning in 1847. From Council Bluffs, Iowa to Fort Bridger in Wyoming, the trail follows much the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> as the Oregon Trail and the California Trail; these trails are collectively known as the Emigrant Trail.|$|E
5|$|The group, now {{numbering}} approximately twenty people, left Constantinople {{in early}} May 1915. They crossed the Bosphorus {{to take the}} unfinished Baghdad Railway to Baghdad. The Taurus Mountains were crossed on horseback, using—as von Hentig reflected—the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> taken by Alexander the Great, Paul the Apostle, and Frederick I. The group crossed the Euphrates at high flood, finally reaching Baghdad {{towards the end of}} May.|$|E
5|$|To {{serve the}} {{expected}} demand of the expansion, the DHO {{built a new}} four lane freeway north from Highway401 at Renforth Drive. This new route, which roughly followed the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> as Highway 427 as far as Dixon/Airport Road, {{was known as the}} Toronto Airport Expressway and was opened on January 3, 1964.|$|E
3000|$|..., {{with the}} <b>same</b> <b>routes</b> {{obtained}} in what mentioned above. Finally, CP 1 also finds the same equal rate allocation as LP 2, and thus, {{it has the}} same implication on the fairness in this case.|$|R
50|$|Luisiana is also {{accessible}} by public transportation taking the <b>same</b> <b>routes</b> as mentioned above. However, whichever route you take, {{a trip to}} Luisiana will still be long since {{it is one of}} the inner towns in Laguna.|$|R
50|$|Connecticut Railway and Lighting Company bus {{operation}} continued {{over many}} of the <b>same</b> <b>routes</b> for years. All operations {{came to an end}} in 1973, and the transit franchises were surrendered to the North East Transportation Company, operating buses on a contract basis for CT Transit.|$|R
5|$|According to Kate, Farrar {{had moved}} out of the family home and spurned Green's desire for an amicable separation. Kate {{stressed}} that she loved and respected her mother and that all of the children had had good relationships with her, but that she was angry at her father for upsetting her mother by leaving. Pressed, she acknowledged that her mother had begun to drink large quantities of alcohol. She denied that she had ever seen matches in the house and expressed surprise that Tim had not escaped by the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> she had, which was via a bedroom window onto the roof.|$|E
5|$|Buses are {{provided}} by two companies. Service 17 is operated by Nefyn Coaches, with six Monday to Saturday return journeys on the Pwllheli–Llanbedrog–Mynytho–Nanhoron–Botwnnog–Sarn Meyllteyrn–Penygroeslon–Rhoshirwaun–Aberdaron route. Two of the Aberdaron bound journeys divert through Bryn-croes. Arriva Buses Wales provide a late night return journey on Saturdays. Service 17 is supplemented by Nefyn Coaches service 17b, running return journeys twice a day, Monday to Saturday, largely over the <b>same</b> <b>route,</b> but with diversions to serve Penllech and Llangwnnad towards Aberdaron, or Penycaerau and Y Rhiw heading back to Pwllheli.|$|E
5|$|Emigration to {{the west}} {{decreased}} over the following years, but {{it is likely that}} the drop in numbers was caused more by fears over the outcome of the ongoing Mexican-American War than by the cautionary tale of the Donner Party. In 1846, an estimated 1,500 people migrated to California. In 1847, the number dropped to 450 and to 400 in 1848. The California Gold Rush spurred a sharp increase, however, and 25,000 people went west in 1849. Most of the overland migration followed the Carson River, but a few forty-niners used the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> as the Donner Party and recorded descriptions about the site.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{some changes}} over the years, many current COTA buses run the <b>same</b> <b>routes</b> {{as the former}} streetcars. Bus route numbers 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, and 54 deviate very little from the path taken by their railed predecessors.|$|R
50|$|The vessel {{he was to}} {{take charge}} of was the Sir Lancelot {{one of the most famous}} {{clippers}} on the China run. The Sir Lancelot was a very fast vessel and frequently overtook other ships on the <b>same</b> <b>routes</b> by a matter of days.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to above-mentioned attributes of ethanologenic micro-organisms, thermostability {{is another important}} characteristic influencing the fermentation efficiency positively. Thermophiles might have the <b>same</b> <b>routes</b> of oxidation and fermentation process familiar to the mesophiles. However, their thermozymes are more efficient as the biochemical reactions occur at elevated temperatures [34, 35].|$|R
5|$|Eventually {{it became}} obvious, even to Ney, that cavalry alone were {{achieving}} little. Belatedly, he organised a combined-arms attack, using Bachelu's division and Tissot's regiment of Foy's division from Reille's II Corps (about 6,500infantrymen) plus those French cavalry that remained {{in a fit}} state to fight. This assault was directed along much the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> as the previous heavy cavalry attacks (between Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte). It was halted by a charge of the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge. The British cavalry were unable, however, to break the French infantry, and fell back with losses from musketry fire.|$|E
5|$|For {{the main}} villain in the film, Maximillian Largo, Connery {{suggested}} Klaus Maria Brandauer, {{the lead of}} the 1981 Academy Award-winning Hungarian film Mephisto. Through the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> came Max von Sydow as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, although he still retained his Eon-originated white cat in the film. For the femme fatale, director Irvin Kershner selected former model and Playboy cover girl Barbara Carrera to play Fatima Blush – the name coming from one of the early scripts of Thunderball. Carrera's performance as Fatima Blush earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, which she lost to Cher for her role in Silkwood.|$|E
5|$|From 31 January 2010, Scandinavian Airlines {{terminated}} {{its service}} from Molde to Trondheim. Krohn Air started operations on 3 February 2010 on the <b>same</b> <b>route,</b> using a Dornier Do 328 wet leased from Sun Air of Scandinavia. The airline was established and fully owned by Claus Krohn, a local businessman, who was 76 {{years old at}} the time. SAS stated in 2011 that they did not regret closing the route, as with the size of aircraft they operated they would need in excess of 20,000 passengers per year on the route, while Krohn Air could survive with fewer because they used smaller aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the class}} was renewed at Wolverhampton Works under George Armstrong in 1885/6; the {{renewals}} were more conventional in appearance, with large splashers, but the class's nickname stuck. At first the renewals also ran on the <b>same</b> <b>routes</b> as their predecessors, though later some were transferred further south.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} in November 2014, that CityJet routes from Cardiff to Edinburgh and Paris-Orly were to be operated by Stobart Air from 1 December 2014. However, both routes will cease by June 2015 since Flybe introduced flights the <b>same</b> <b>routes</b> from Cardiff, supported by the airports's operator.|$|R
5000|$|Through their {{introduction}} of the elliptical wing-planform, their designs set officially recognized speed records. Lufthansa purchased the He 70, nicknaming it the Heinkel-Blitz (blitz means [...] "lightning"), and instituted [...] "blitz" [...] air-routes between Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg, and Frankfurt comparable to today's travel time for the <b>same</b> <b>routes.</b>|$|R
5|$|From {{its opening}} on November 20, 1978, until December 11, 1979, the Orange Line was co-aligned with the Blue Line from National Airport to Stadium-Armory, with the Orange Line {{continuing}} east from Stadium-Armory to New Carrollton. Beginning December 1, 1979, the Orange Line diverged westward from Rosslyn to Ballston. The Blue and Orange Lines remain co-aligned from Rosslyn to Stadium-Armory and the Silver Line is co-signed along the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1695, a {{three-way}} {{invasion of the}} Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, Cobán and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán. Following the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> used in 1686, they managed {{on the way to}} recruit 200indigenous Maya warriors from Santa Eulalia, San Juan Solomá and San Mateo itself. On 28 February 1695, all three groups left their respective bases of operations to conquer the Lacandon. The San Mateo group headed northeast into the Lacandon Jungle.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Tourist Trophy the Isle of Man had {{hosted the}} English trials for the Gordon Bennett Cup as the English {{government}} had banned motor racing on its roads. The Automobile Club {{wanted to run}} an event to help develop fuel efficiency in motor cars and opted to use the <b>same</b> <b>route</b> as had been used for the trials. In {{order to make the}} event relevant to those cars on general sale they imposed rules to prevent specialist race cars from entering, though there were complaints that the rules were too restrictive and detracted from the spectacle.|$|E
5|$|In the city's {{early years}} trams {{followed}} {{many of these}} <b>same</b> <b>routes.</b> Until {{the demise of the}} system in the 1950s, this area was also {{at the heart of the}} Dunedin cable tramway system, with the longer lines running up the slopes of City Rise via High, Rattray, or Stuart Streets.|$|R
25|$|In Lower Manhattan, {{there is}} one {{directional}} pair of bus lanes. Southbound Broadway contains a bus lane between Bowling Green and Houston Street, which carries the M55 and Staten Island express routes. Northbound Church Street, between Battery Place and Warren Street, carries these <b>same</b> <b>routes</b> one block west of Broadway.|$|R
25|$|Since {{most of the}} Jin troops just {{returned}} from their first expedition and had not even unpacked, the army was quickly mobilised. Following precedents set in the previous campaign, the Jin army divided into two groups, Wolibu's northern army and Nianhan's western army, even daring to take the <b>same</b> <b>routes</b> again.|$|R
