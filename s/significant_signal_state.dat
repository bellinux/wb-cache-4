40|$|International audienceOne crucial {{component}} in light signaling is {{the quantity of}} photoreceptor present in the active <b>signaling</b> <b>state.</b> The lifetime of the <b>signaling</b> <b>state</b> of a photoreceptor is limited because of thermal or otherwise back reversion of the chromophore to the ground state, and/or degradation of the photoreceptor in the light-activated state. It was previously shown that the lit state of plant cryptochromes contains flavin-neutral semiquinone, and that the half-lives of the lit state were {{in the range of}} 34 min in vitro. However, it was unknown how long-lived the <b>signaling</b> <b>states</b> of plant cryptochromes are in situ. Based on the loss of degradation of cry 2 after prolonged dark incubation and loss of reversibility of photoactivated cry 1 by a pulse of green light, we estimate the in vivo half-lives of the <b>signaling</b> <b>states</b> of cry 1 and cry 2 to be in the range of 5 and 16 min, respectively. Based on electron paramagnetic resonance measurements, the lifetime of the Arabidopsis cry 1 lit state in insect cells was found to be similar to 6 min, and thus very similar to the lifetime of the <b>signaling</b> <b>state</b> in planta. Thus, the <b>signaling</b> <b>state</b> lifetimes of plant cryptochromes are not, or are only moderately, stabilized in planta...|$|R

Binding of Nile Red, reflected by a large blue shift and increase in fluorescence quantum yield of the Nile Red emission, is observed exclusively when PYP resides in its <b>signaling</b> <b>state.</b> N-terminal truncation of the protein allows assignment of the region surrounding the chromophore as the site where Nile Red binds to PYP. We also observed a pH dependence of the affinity of Nile Red for pB, which we propose is caused by pH dependent differences {{of the structure of}} the <b>signaling</b> <b>state.</b> From a comparative analysis of the kinetics of Nile Red binding and transient absorption changes in the visible region we can conclude that protonation of the chromophore precedes the exposure of a hydrophobic surface near the chromophore binding site, upon formation of the <b>signaling</b> <b>state.</b> Furthermore, the data presented here favor the view that the <b>signaling</b> <b>state</b> is structurally heterogeneous...|$|R

The full-length protein, BlrP 1, and its BLUF domain, BlrP 1 _BLUF, are characterized by optical absorption and emission spectroscopy. The cofactor FAD in its oxidized redox state (FADox) is brought from the dark-adapted receptor state to the 10 -nm red-shifted putative <b>signalling</b> <b>state</b> by violet light exposure.

The quantum yield of <b>signalling</b> <b>state</b> formation is about 0. 17 for BlrP 1 _BLUF and about 0. 08 for BlrP 1. The fluorescence efficiency of the FADox cofactor is small due to photo-induced reductive electron transfer.

Refolding was studied by stopped-flow absorbance spectroscopy for PYP with either a trans or a cis chromophore.

When the cis chromophore is present, refolding from the unfolded state proceeds through the putative <b>signaling</b> <b>state</b> of PYP as an on-pathway intermediate.
