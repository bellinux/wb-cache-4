50|$|In 1947 the bipolar {{point-contact}} transistor {{was invented}} by Walter H. Brattain and John Bardeen {{under the direction of}} William Shockley at Bell Labs. In 1948 Shockley's invention of the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) improved the stability and performance of transistors, and reduced costs. By the 1950s, higher power semiconductor diodes became available and started replacing vacuum tubes. In 1956 the <b>silicon</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>rectifier</b> (<b>SCR)</b> was introduced by General Electric, greatly increasing the range of power electronics applications.|$|E
50|$|The benistor {{was invented}} in 1995 by Beniamin Acatrinei, a Romanian born {{inventor}} living in Silicon Valley, California. Acatrinei’s intention was to improve upon the thyristor or <b>silicon</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>rectifier</b> (<b>SCR)</b> which has certain limitations. The benistor concept was initially published in two US patents issued in 1997 and 1999. The benistor received significant recognition for its originality and versatility, {{but there have been}} limited product applications to date. However, the LED Lighting power management market is an excellent application for the benistor, because LEDs are non-linear devices that require constant current in a limited maximum voltage supply range. Providing constant current in a limited maximum voltage range is necessary to achieve minimum dissipation and maximum efficiency, and is a technical challenge which is an ideal application for benistor.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to its use as the active device in relaxation oscillators, {{one of the most}} important applications of UJTs or PUTs is to trigger thyristors (<b>silicon</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>rectifiers</b> (<b>SCR),</b> TRIAC, etc.). A DC voltage can be used to control a UJT or PUT circuit such that the [...] "on-period" [...] increases with an increase in the DC control voltage. This application is important for large AC current control.|$|R
50|$|Series {{triggering}} is {{more common}} in high powered, water-cooled flashtubes, such as those found in lasers. The high-voltage leads of the trigger-transformer are connected to the flashtube in series, (one lead to an electrode and the other to the capacitor). The trigger pulse forms a spark inside the lamp, without exposing the trigger voltage to the outside of the lamp. The advantages are better insulation, more reliable triggering, and an arc that tends to develop well away from the glass, but at a much higher cost. The series-triggering transformer also acts as an inductor. This helps to control the flash duration, but prevents the circuit from being used in very fast discharge applications. The triggering can generally take place with a lower voltage at the capacitor than is required for external triggering. However, the trigger-transformer becomes part of the flash circuit, and couples the triggering-circuit to the flash energy. Therefore, because the trigger-transformer has very low impedance, the transformer, triggering-circuit, and <b>silicon</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>rectifier</b> (<b>SCR)</b> must be able to handle very high peak-currents, often in excess of 1500 amps.|$|E

Most TRIACs can be triggered by applying either a positive or negative voltage to the gate (an SCR requires a positive voltage).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new engineering approach to audio clipping preamplifier {{that can be}} used for the tone modification and volume control of electronic devices. The approach consists of a unique design based on a summation amplifier, <b>Silicon</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Rectifiers</b> (<b>SCR)</b> and RC networks that enables signal gain, improved frequency response, tone modification and signal shape clipping. The proposed summation amplifier based design produces more gain resulting in larger range of clipping effect as compared to existing methods. The response is altered to produce low bass frequencies that have been amplified based on a new configuration allowing the user to change the reactance within the summation circuitry. Also, a new technique of <b>Silicon</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Rectifiers</b> (<b>SCR)</b> with a variable RC network accomplishes a clipping network that adjusts the shape of clipping signal.
