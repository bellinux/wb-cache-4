40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} dynamic {{model for a}} {{multiple}} continuum arm robot inspired by live octopuses. The kinematics and dynamics for a <b>single</b> <b>arm</b> are analyzed and formulated including the longitudinal muscles, radial muscles, isovolumetric constraints, and interaction between suckers and an object. The <b>single</b> <b>arm</b> model is then expanded to a multiple arm system {{that is capable of}} generating archetypal locomotion patterns such as crawling and swimming. A hierarchical controller based on octopus neurophysiology is used to achieve simple and reliable control of the multiple continuum arm system. Simulations for <b>single</b> <b>arm</b> movements and multiple arm locomotions are presented. The results of this work can be used in the study of control schemes for multiple continuum arm robots and live octopuses...|$|R

50|$|This is a <b>single</b> <b>arm</b> {{rotational}} molding machine. The arm is usually supported by other arms on both ends. The clamshell machine heats and cools the mold {{in the same}} chamber. It takes up less space than equivalent shuttle and swing arm rotational molders. It is low in cost compared {{to the size of}} products made. It is available in smaller scales for schools interested in prototyping and for high quality models. More than one mold can be attached to the <b>single</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) with {{a finite}} horizon and multiple pulls per period. Leveraging the Lagrangian relaxation, we approximate {{the problem with}} a collection of <b>single</b> <b>arm</b> problems. We then propose an index-based policy that uses optimal solutions of the <b>single</b> <b>arm</b> problems to index individual arms, and offer a proof that it is asymptotically optimal as the number of arms tends to infinity. We also use simulation to show that this index-based policy performs better than the state-of-art heuristics in various problem settings...|$|R
