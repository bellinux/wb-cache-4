25|$|To {{transmit}} {{from one}} plant {{to another and}} from one plant cell to another, plant viruses must use <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> usually different from animal viruses. Plants do not move, and so plant-to-plant transmission usually involves vectors (such as insects). Plant cells are surrounded by solid cell walls, therefore transport through plasmodesmata is the preferred path for virions to move between plant cells. Plants have specialized mechanisms for transporting mRNAs through plasmodesmata, and these mechanisms {{are thought to be}} used by RNA viruses to spread from one cell to another.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} stated function {{refers to}} the effect the behavior produces on the environment. The actual form of the behavior is referred to the topography. Different behaviors may serve the same function, thus describing one limitation of treating behaviors based on form alone. For example, a child may scream, hit, and cry to obtain attention from his mother. What the behavior looks like often reveals little useful information about the conditions that account for it. However, identifying the conditions that account for a behavior, suggests what conditions need to be altered to change the behavior. Therefore, assessment of function of a behavior can yield useful information with respect to intervention <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> likely to be effective.|$|E

It is aimed to describe the learning strategies used to develop English speaking skill: {{a case study of}} to higher achievers at stikes „aisyiyah Surakarta. Learning strategies to develop English speaking skill divided into four aspects. The aspects are fluency, pronunciation, vocabulary repertoire, and grammar knowledge. This research is conducted by analyzing the data by employing the concept of Miles, Huberman and Spradley. The type of this study is case study. The subject of this study is a student of higher achievers at stikes „aisyiyah Surakarta. The writer uses interview and observation to collect the data. The result of analysis shows <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> four aspects, <b>that</b> is: (1) The learning strategies used to develop fluency there <b>are</b> metacognitive <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> organizational planning, cognitive <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> rehearsal, and social/ affective <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> self-talk. (2) The learning strategies used to develop pronunciation there <b>is</b> cognitive <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> included note taking and rehearsal. (3) The learning strategies used to develop vocabulary repertoire there <b>is</b> cognitive <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> included translation and note taking.

25|$|The {{linear search}} problem was solved by Anatole Beck and Donald J. Newman (1970) as a two-person zero-sum game. Their minimax {{trajectory}} is {{to double the}} distance on each step and the optimal strategy {{is a mixture of}} trajectories that increase the distance by some fixed constant. This solution gives search <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not sensitive to assumptions concerning the distribution of the target. Thus, it also presents an upper bound for a worst-case scenario. This solution was obtained in the framework of an online algorithm by Shmuel Gal, who also generalized this result to a set of concurrent rays. The best online competitive ratio for the search on the line is 9 but it can be reduced to 4.6 by using a randomized strategy. The online solution with a turn cost is given in.|$|E
500|$|Several {{prominent}} scientists {{working in}} the field of neuroscience supported Carr's argument as scientifically plausible. James Olds, a professor of computational neuroscience, who directs the Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study at George Mason University, was quoted in Carr's essay for his expertise, and upon the essay's publication Olds {{wrote a letter to the}} editor of The Atlantic in which he reiterated that the brain was [...] "very plastic" [...] — referring to the changes that occur in the organization of the brain as a result of experience. It was Olds' opinion that given the brain's plasticity it was [...] "not such a long stretch to Carr's meme". One of the pioneers in neuroplasticity research, Michael Merzenich, later added his own comment to the discussion, stating that he had given a talk at Google in 2008 in which he had asked the audience the same question that Carr asked in his essay. Merzenich believed that there was [...] "absolutely no question that our brains are engaged less directly and more shallowly in the synthesis of information, when we use research <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> all about 'efficiency', 'secondary (and out-of-context) referencing', and 'once over, lightly'". Another neuroscientist, Gary Small, director of UCLA's Memory & Aging Research Center, wrote a letter to the editor of The Atlantic in which he stated that he believed that [...] "brains are developing circuitry for online social networking and are adapting to a new multitasking technology culture".|$|E

[...] See for example Porter generic strategies which talks about product differentiation and focused market segmentation as two alternatives to cost leadership. Sterman et al. show that expanding rapidly to realize experience curve benefits is a high risk strategy in dynamic markets with common features like bounded rationality and durable products.|$|E

HCJPD is [...] "committed to the protection of the public, utilizing intervention <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> community-based, family-oriented and least restrictive while emphasizing responsibility and accountability of both parent and child". Feeding into HCJPD is the juvenile court system that includes five juvenile courts (each with a different judge presiding), a juvenile mental health court, and a juvenile drug court.|$|E
2500|$|There are a {{large number}} of Nash equilibria in a {{centipede}} game, but in each, the first player defects on the first round and the second player defects in the next round frequently enough to dissuade the first player from passing. [...] Being in a Nash equilibrium does not require that strategies be rational at every point in the game as in the subgame perfect equilibrium. [...] This means that <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> cooperative in the never-reached later rounds of the game could still be in a Nash equilibrium. [...] In the example above, one Nash equilibrium is for both players to defect on each round (even in the later rounds that are never reached). [...] Another Nash equilibrium is for player 1 to defect on the first round, but pass on the third round and for player 2 to defect at any opportunity.|$|E

2500|$|Critics of deconstructivism {{see it as}} {{a purely}} formal {{exercise}} with little social significance. Kenneth Frampton finds it [...] "elitist and detached". Nikos Salingaros calls deconstructivism a [...] "viral expression" [...] that invades design thinking in order to build destroyed forms; while curiously similar to both Derrida's and Philip Johnson's descriptions, this is meant as a harsh condemnation of the entire movement. Other criticisms {{are similar to those of}} deconstructivist philosophy—that since the act of deconstructivism is not an empirical process, it can result in whatever an architect wishes, and it thus suffers from a lack of consistency. Today there is a sense that the philosophical underpinnings of the beginning of the movement have been lost, and all that is left is the aesthetic of deconstructivism. Other criticisms reject the premise that architecture is a language capable of being the subject of linguistic philosophy, or, if it was a language in the past, critics claim it is no longer. Others question the wisdom and impact on future generations of an architecture that rejects the past and presents no clear values as replacements and which often pursues <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> intentionally aggressive to human senses.|$|E
