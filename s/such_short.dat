5|$|Avinor {{wants to}} extend most short {{airports}} to 1200 m by year 2030, {{because they see}} a lack of aircraft types which have more than 19 seats able to use 800-meter runways. Dash 8 built after 2009 can't use them. Few countries apart from Norway have <b>such</b> <b>short</b> airports. There is however no room for this at Hasvik, so the plan here and for some other airports with few passengers, is to use small planes with less than 20 seats.|$|E
5|$|In Southeast Asia and Indonesia, male {{long hair}} was valued in until the seventeenth century, when the area adopted outside {{influences}} including Islam and Christianity. Invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men {{as a sign}} of servitude, as well. They were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas, such as Thailand, and struggled to explain why women in the area had <b>such</b> <b>short</b> hair. They came up with several mythical stories, one of which involved a king who found a long hair in his rice and, in a rage, demanded that all women keep their hair short.|$|E

5|$|Max-Hellmuth Ostermann (11December 1917 – 9August 1942) was a Luftwaffe fighter ace during World War II. A flying ace or fighter ace is a {{military}} aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat. He is credited with 102 enemy aircraft shot down claimed in over 300 combat missions. The majority of his victories were claimed over the Eastern Front with eight claims over the Western Front and one over Belgrade. Ostermann was of <b>such</b> <b>short</b> height that wooden blocks had to be attached to his rudder pedals for him to engage in tight turning aerial combat.|$|E

Almost all of Harrison's first-choice names signed on immediately, while a day spent boating with Memphis musician Don Nix resulted in the latter agreeing to organise a group of backing singers. A local Indian astrologer had advised early August as a good time in which to stage the concert, and as things transpired, the 1st of that month, a Sunday, was the only day that Madison Square Garden was available at <b>such</b> <b>short</b> notice.|$|E
5|$|The twenty days between Braden's {{perfect game}} and Halladay's was the {{shortest}} span between two perfect games since 1880 {{and there was}} a chance {{that for the first time}} in MLB history there would be three perfect games in <b>such</b> <b>short</b> succession. Had Galarraga's game been correctly called, the four-day span since Halladay's perfect game would have broken that 130-year-old record, and marked the only time that three consecutive no-hitters had been perfect games, the only time that three perfect games had occurred in one season (since done in 2012 by Philip Humber, Matt Cain and Félix Hernández), the only time that three perfect games had occurred in a span shorter than a month, the only time four perfect games had occurred in a span shorter than a year (as Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox threw a perfect game in July 2009), and the only time that four perfect games had occurred within a stretch of five no-hitters.|$|E

With no landing craft available on <b>such</b> <b>short</b> notice, the division was carried across the Mediterranean by four cruisers, HMS Aurora, , HMS Dido and HMS Sirius of the Royal Navy's 12th Cruiser Squadron, accompanied by the minelayer HMS Abdiel and the American cruiser USS Boise, all commanded by Commodore W.G.

If the landing was successful, the British 78th Infantry Division in Sicily and the 8th Indian Infantry Division in the Middle East, would be sent to reinforce the airborne division, under the command of V Corps.|$|E
