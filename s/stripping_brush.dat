In 1988 he would receive a patent for a push broom head of the channel-mounted bristle type. He would then focus a considerable amount of time innovating a replaceable <b>strip</b> <b>brush.</b> This changed the whole process of manufacturing tube-brooms, as one tube could be recycled simply by replacing the brush through replaceable slide-on strips, versus the old method of wrapping the brush around the tube, welding it together, and shipping the tube back for a replacement wrap when it was worn out, or scrapping the tube altogether. Drumm would obtain several patents relating to the <b>strip</b> <b>brush</b> innovation.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} better, safer, more {{efficient}} system for Sealeze to manufacture spiral-wrapped <b>strip</b> <b>brushes</b> in a continuous fashion at a variable diameter. The end results produced a finalized drawing sheet for machining and production, numerous design variations within CAD drawings, and extensive mechanical evaluations and analyses proving the strength and capabilities of the proposed design. In production of these brushes, various different materials will be used for the core, backing, and filament, creating a need for a mandrel that will be strong enough to handle the most resiliant of materials while maintaining a narrow margin of tolerances for numerous manufacturing jobs while remaining man-portable and minutely adjustable. During the development stage of the project a traditional approach of design, analyze, review, consult, repeat was employed where meetings with the sponsor organization were frequent as progress was made through numerous iterations before arriving at the final design. Despite production of a functioning design that met the sponsor 2 ̆ 7 s desires and initial project development goals, the project is marked by its large size and possible issues of binding and seizing if not properly employed. In addition, the design does not function adequately at small sizes, limiting the range of application. Despite this, based on long term production, the mandrel will increase safety and efficiency for the manufacture of custom-sized, spiral-wrapped <b>strip</b> <b>brushes</b> in an industrial setting.

50|$|About 40% of the {{population}} works in agriculture, producing corn, beans, wheat, barley, oats and potatoes, with peas, vegetables and flowers grown in some municipalities. Most production is for subsistence. Most agriculture is done on ejido land in families by traditional methods and tools. Livestock is mostly sheep and cows. Some fish farming is also done. Forest products include wood, firewood and charcoal. Another traditional source of income, especially in San Felipe del Progreso, is handcrafts, making blankets, sashes, rugs, carrying bags, tablecloths, quexquemitls, vests, and other garments from wool. Other common crafts are making carrying bags from recycled plastic <b>strips,</b> <b>brushes</b> and brooms and pottery.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{continuously}} harvest citrus fruit using on-going harvesting machines such as canopy shakers, the catching system should catch and collect fruits continuously. In this thesis, three concepts were explored for a catching system {{appropriate for the}} canopy harvesting system. The first concept is a brush catching concept applied to low profile catching systems. <b>Strip</b> <b>brush</b> brooms were mounted {{at the end of}} collecting beds to make seals around tree trunk and along the narrow space between trees. The <b>strip</b> <b>brush</b> brooms used in this project were originally manufactured for street sweeping vehicles. Each brush could tilt from 30 degrees up to 45 degrees using an electrical linear actuator. The second concept is to adjust catching unit to an irregular tree row using tree position measured by range sensor. Brush catching units are moved laterally using actuators controlled by the programmable logic controller (PLC). As the tree approaches the front of catching system, its distance is measured by range sensor. An output signal from range sensor is filtered and modulated as continuous step signal. Based on this data, brush catching units can move to accommodate tree misalignment within the row. The last concept is a kind of selective catching concept. This concept was not fully completed in this project. It required two procedures to execute; 1) skip catching mode using actuators; and 2) identifying sensing for immature or diseased trees. The first required procedure could be solved by making enough space between brush catching units for the rejected tree to pass through without catching fruits. Actuating times for skipping mode were studied and preset to PLC. Otherwise, the maturity of trees can be determined using a DGPS based tree fruit harvest selection map. A timer-based method was used to order the trees for selective rejection of immature trees in this study. The efficiency of this catching system was measured in terms of collecting rate and skipping rate under the simulated catching environment. Mean percentage in catching tennis balls (substituted for fruits) was reported as 98. 55 %, while the effectiveness for skipping immature fruits was 68 %...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation of {{brushing}} {{to remove}} lunar simulant dust from thermal control surfaces is described. First, <b>strip</b> <b>brushes</b> made with nylon, PTFE, or Thunderon (Nihon Sanmo Dyeing Company Ltd.) bristles {{were used to}} remove JSC- 1 AF dust from AZ 93 thermal control paint or aluminized FEP (AlFEP) thermal control surface under ambient laboratory conditions. Nylon and PTFE bristles removed a promising amount of dust from AZ 93, and nylon and Thunderon bristles from AlFEP. But when these were tested under simulated lunar conditions in the lunar dust adhesion bell jar (LDAB), they were not effective. In a third effort, seven brushes made up of three different materials, two different geometries, and different bristle lengths and thicknesses were tested under laboratory conditions against AZ 93 and AlFEP. Two of these brushes, the Zephyr fiberglass fingerprint brush and the Escoda nylon fan brush, removed over 90 percent of the dust, and so were tested in the fourth effort in the LDAB.

40|$|Asymmetrical {{and lower}} heat {{transport}} {{caused by the}} cladding strip during twin-roll casting (TRC) of clad sheet makes the process window narrow compared with traditional TRC. The effect of pouring temperature on process stability is more remarkable when it is relatively high under high casting speed and casting speed becomes a leading factor when its value is low. The inter-diffusion zone width at the Al/Fe interface depends on the solid/semi-solid contacting time. The longer the time is, the wider the inter-diffusion zone. A widest zone of 3. 8 μm is attained under condition of casting speed of 1. 25 m/min and pouring temperature of 720 °C. Bonding strength of clad sheet by TRC depends on inter-diffusion zone width and rolling reduction. Proper combinations of inter-diffusion zone width and rolling reduction can result in same high bonding strength. The highest bonding strength of 16 N/mm is attained under a combination of rolling reduction of 29 % and inter-diffusion zone of 3. 7 μm. The wetting of aluminum melt on steel surface is uneven and insufficient {{as a result of}} short contacting time in TRC. As a result, same rolling reduction in TRC induces lower bonding strength than in roll bonding process.

50|$|Generally, the Salihiyah and the Idrisiyah {{leaders were}} more {{interested}} in the establishment of a jama'ah along the Shabeelle and Jubba rivers and the fertile land between them than in teaching because few were learned in Islam. Their early efforts to establish farming communities resulted in cooperative cultivation and harvesting and some effective agricultural methods. In Somalia's riverine region, for example, only jama'ah members thought of <b>stripping</b> the <b>brush</b> from areas around their fields to reduce the breeding places of tsetse flies.Local leaders of brotherhoods customarily asked lineage heads in the areas where they wished to settle for permission to build their mosques and communities. A piece of land was usually freely given; often it was an area between two clans or one in which nomads had access to a river. The presence of a jama'ah not only provided a buffer zone between two hostile groups, but also caused the giver to acquire a blessing since the land was considered given to God. Tenure was a matter of charity only, however, and sometimes became precarious in case of disagreements. No statistics were available in 1990 on the number of such settlements, but in the 1950s there were more than ninety in the south, with a total of about 35,000 members. Most were in the Bakool, Gedo, and Bay regions or along the middle and lower Shabele River. There were few jamaat in other regions because the climate and soil did not encourage agricultural settlements.|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that livestock industries {{are vulnerable to}} intentional or accidental introductions of Foreign Animal Diseases (FADs). Combating disease is difficult because of unknown wildlife-livestock interactions. Feral hogs (Sus scrofa) could harbor and shed disease in areas used by domestic livestock such as cattle (Bos taurus). Extent of risk logically depends on spatio-temporal interactions between species. I used Global Positioning System (GPS) collars on cattle and hogs in combination with a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for detailed analysis on movement patterns of these 2 species on a ranch in southwestern Texas, USA. Motion-triggered video recorders were also utilized to determine interspecific activity patterns. I tested hypotheses that spatio-temporal distributions of domestic cattle and feral hogs on rangeland overlap and that interspecific contact occurs. If these posits are true, {{it is possible that}} introduced pathogens like foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) could be transmitted from feral hogs to cattle. Using a rate of 1 GPS fix/ 15 min (96 fixes/day), I found that spatial distribution of individual hogs and cattle overlapped on both the 95 % and 50 % kernel area use among 4 seasons. Both cows and feral hogs used Clay Flat, Clay Loam, and Rolling Hardland more so than other range sites. During Summer 2004, riparian zones were the most used feature, identified at 14 % (2, 760 / 19, 365) of cattle and 70 % (445 / 632) of hog fixes. Other than <b>brush</b> <b>strips,</b> cattle and feral hogs primarily interacted at riparian zones, fencelines, and roads. There were no direct interspecific contacts evident from GPS data, but 3 cases were recorded from video data. Indirect interspecific contacts that may be sufficient for disease transmission occurred much more frequently (GPS = 3. 35 indirect contacts/day, video = cows follow hogs: 0. 69 indirect contacts/day and hogs follow cows: 0. 54 indirect contacts/day). Research results suggested that both species often travel along the same roads and fencelines to water and food sources, especially during extreme heat and low-precipitation conditions. This research provides basic information needed to improve models for management of FAD outbreaks in the U.

The efficacy and safety of peroxide-based teeth whitening has been a largely contested issue over the last two decades. Several reviews have been written on the subject, but the current literature lacks a more involved description of the key factors that influence whitening effects and the manifestation of its adverse effects. Thus, a review of these key factors should be able to more clearly define how these influence treatment outcome during peroxide-based teeth whitening treatments, and how these treatments are likely to expose individuals to additional risk factors. Based on evidence in the current literature, whitening efficacies are dependent on a series of variables associated with treatment. Of these variables, the ones more directly associated with the whitening effects produced after treatment are peroxide concentration, active bleaching time, and [...] to some extent [...] the choice between currently available delivery systems (trays, <b>strips,</b> application <b>brushes).</b> From the studies reviewed, higher concentrations of peroxide produce more pronounced whitening effects, while lower concentrations needing longer active bleaching times to produce similar color changes, as measured by either VITA shade guides, or the CIEL*a*b* system. Color relegations are likely to occur with treatments composed of lower number of treatment sessions compared to treatments with multiple sessions. In terms of adverse effects, peroxides have been found to potentially be associated with carcinogenicity and cytotoxicity not only in oral tissues but in the gastrointestinal lining of hamsters and rats during in vivo studies. However, current reviews and studies have highlighted that excessive levels of peroxide exposure are needed to promote tumor growth or induce cytotoxic effects in the oral cavity; thus, it is unlikely that teeth whitening use of peroxides exposes individuals to dangerous levels of carcinogenicity and cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, some studies have found a decrease in odontoblast viability at concentrations of 16 % carbamide peroxide, suggesting cytotoxicity may become a more significant factor at carbamide peroxide concentrations higher than 16 %. Tooth and gingival sensitivity was closely {{associated with the use of}} either higher peroxide concentrations or longer active bleaching times. However, desensitizing agents such as fluoride, potassium nitrate, and amorphous calcium-phosphate have been found to effectively reduce this sensitivity of teeth and gingival tissues in people experiencing tissue sensitivity. Structural damage to enamel and dentin were found to be statistically insignificant in the studies reviewed, with whitening products of low acidity causing the bulk of the observed demineralization in in vitro studies. In vivo studies evaluating peroxide-associated demineralization have suggested that salivary components are capable of fully remineralizing any affected teeth structures following peroxide-based teeth whitening. In conclusion, from the studies analyzed, it is advisable to use concentrations lower than 16 % carbamide peroxide during at-home treatments. However, use of higher concentrations are acceptable if provided under professional supervision. People with gingival recessions are more likely to experience sensitivity, so use of desensitizing agents at the time of treatment is advisable. In terms of whitening pastes, whitening gels of relatively neutral pH should be used (pH between 5 and 7) to reduce enamel and dentin demineralization; additives may include desensitizing agents to help with sensitivity and antioxidants which can counteract the oxidative stress of peroxides on oral tissues...|$|R
5000|$|Vernon's travels {{brought him}} to his father's hunting cabin, roughly an hour {{northwest}} of his hometown and outside of Medford, Wisconsin. He {{and his father had}} often spent weekends at the 80-acre rural property—an area they dubbed [...] "the land"—when he was growing up. In an interview, he described it as [...] "a little alpine-style, timber-frame cabin." [...] The cabin was not necessarily ramshackle; his father had replaced its dirt floor and installed plumbing years before. For roughly three weeks, Vernon sat alone in the shack, drinking beer and watching television. He mulled over thoughts about his relationship with Jensen, a break-up he had struggled to get over. He hunted his food, a practice that he had learned from his father. He killed two deer in his period at the property, which lasted the entire three months [...] "and then some," [...] according to Vernon. At one point, he faced a wild bear that entered the cabin late one night, enticed by his stew. His father would drop by [...] "every 10 days or so," [...] supplying his son with beer, eggs, and cheese. Vernon completed tasks for him, such as <b>stripping</b> wood, clearing <b>brush,</b> and stacking lumber. He did not intend to stay for long, viewing the excursion as [...] "an opportunity to escape the trap of society, to not pay bills, to play music and live really cheaply." [...] Instead, he stayed for three months in the harsh Wisconsin winter. I arrived at the cabin in November, so there's a very big winter theme for everything when I was there. On a physical level, I would wake up to stoke the fire or get wood chopped to get it in the house to keep warm. Just winter in general was kind of a part of where I was physically and metaphysically as well. It bled into the music naturally. I had nothing but the sound of my own thoughts, and they were really loud when that's all that was going on. Justin Vernon on his isolated winter After three weeks, Vernon grew tired of his [...] "self-indulgent, lazy behavior" [...] and began forming song ideas. He had an idea for a song and brought inside his musical equipment, which consisted of several guitars, microphones, and an old-model Macintosh with ProTools LE. Shortly before exiting Raleigh, he had developed song ideas but ceased working on them in his depression. He began recording songs and layering his vocals atop more vocals, imitating a choir. He sang in falsetto, which he had first tried with his previous band. He gained freedom in singing in a higher register, feeling he accessed [...] "painful melodies" [...] unattainable in his previous work. He further manipulated his recorded vocals using the software Auto-Tune. Soon, he began developing more songs, which were worked on in 12-hour [...] "bursts" [...] of productivity. [...] "I would work for 14 hours a day and start to feel a little insane," [...] he later commented. The work was [...] "labor-intensive," [...] as he often merged over a minimum of eight tracks of vocals on each song. He likened the singularity of the process to his teenage years, where he worked alone with an eight-track. According to Vernon, days were hazy and began to run together for him. He would wake each morning at sunrise, due to the light reflecting from the snow. To help repair his 1964 Sears Silvertone guitar, he traded venison in the nearby town. By February, with winter drawing to a close, Vernon emerged from the cabin with nine songs. He left still feeling physically sick from the infection, nor did he feel [...] "renewed" [...] from his creative catharsis. He spent additional time in Raleigh recording brass on [...] "For Emma." ...|$|R
