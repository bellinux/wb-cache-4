5|$|The Eleanor Roosevelt Monument in New York's Riverside Park was {{dedicated}} in 1996, with First Lady Hillary Clinton {{serving as the}} keynote speaker. It {{is said to be}} the first monument to an American president's wife. The centerpiece is a statue of Eleanor sculpted by Penelope Jencks, and the surrounding granite pavement contains inscriptions designed by the architect Michael Middleton Dwyer, including summaries of her achievements, and a quote from her 1958 speech at the United Nations advocating universal human rights. The following year, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial {{was dedicated}}; it has a bronze statue of Eleanor Roosevelt <b>standing</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> United Nations emblem, which honors her dedication to the United Nations. It is the only presidential memorial to depict a First Lady.|$|E

25|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, Joseph Lewis, {{longtime}} {{president of the}} Freethinkers of America and an ardent Paine admirer, was instrumental in having larger-than-life-sized statues of Paine erected {{in each of the}} three countries with which the revolutionary writer was associated. The first, created by Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum, was erected in Paris just before World War II began (but not formally dedicated until 1948). It depicts Paine <b>standing</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> French National Convention to plead for the life of King Louis XVI. The second, sculpted in 1950 by Georg J. Lober, was erected near Paine's one time home in Morristown, New Jersey. It shows a seated Paine using a drum-head as a makeshift table. The third, sculpted by Sir Charles Wheeler, President of the Royal Academy, was erected in 1964 in Paine's birthplace, Thetford, England. With quill pen in his right hand and an inverted copy of The Rights of Man in his left, it occupies a prominent spot on King Street. Thomas Paine was ranked #34 in the 100 Greatest Britons 2002 extensive Nationwide poll conducted by the BBC.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the south}} window, the first panel of {{which shows the}} {{archangel}} Michael holding a trumpet, representing the call to battle, and, above his head, a seated woman with children at her knee, symbolising the sacrifices {{of women and children}} in the name of liberty, honour, and justice, while in the lower portion an armoured figure bears the Crown of Victory in his hands. The second panel contains the inscriptions: AT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN AND IN THE MORNING WE WILL REMEMBER THEM, taken from the work of Laurence Binyon, and FREEDOM IS THE SURE POSSESSION OF THOSE ALONE WHO HAVE COURAGE TO DEFEND IT, from Pericles, as well as, in the lower portion, an armoured figure holding a flambeau, and, in the upper part, St. George slaying the dragon. The third panel contains Lady Justice bearing the Scales of Justice and the Great Sword of Judgement, the sword-guard of which shows a figure in a crucifixion pose—representing suffering for both the victors and the defeated—and below her the words JUSTITIA LIBERTAS PERPETUO (Justice Liberty in Perpetuity). Beneath Lady Justice in this panel is the heroic figure of Canada wearing armour and helmet and holding the laurel wreath of victory, but looking mournfully at the Book of Remembrance, and behind her are two other persons, one symbolising Canadian motherhood and the other First Nations. The fourth quadrant shows Joan of Arc bearing a shield and <b>standing</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> royal coat of arms of France.|$|E

500|$|When the {{interview}} ended at 13:35, the doctor {{noted that he}} found Lamb's hour-long maintenance of this seemingly hypomanic behaviour [...] "remarkable". Simulation on Lamb's part was unlikely, Yaworsky believed, and lack of memory credible. The doctor wrote in his report that Lamb had been [...] "suffering from a disease of the mind" [...] {{at the time of}} the shootings, which had caused him to be in a kind of dream world, outside of reality. <b>Standing</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> magistrate that same afternoon, Yaworsky testified that Lamb was mentally unsound and not fit to stand trial. The magistrate once again remanded Lamb, this time to custody at Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre for a minimum of 30 days. Lamb was again examined on 29 June 1966, this time by James Dolan, the Clinical Director of Psychiatry at St Thomas Elgin General Hospital.|$|E
500|$|In the Old Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, {{the goddess}} Ishtar sends Taurus, the Bull of Heaven, to kill Gilgamesh for spurning her advances. Enkidu tears off the bull's hind part and hurls the {{quarters}} {{into the sky}} where they become the stars we know as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. Some locate Gilgamesh as the neighboring constellation of Orion, facing Taurus as if in combat, while others identify him with the sun whose rising on the equinox vanquishes the constellation. In early Mesopotamian art, the Bull of Heaven was closely associated with Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of sexual love, fertility, and warfare. One of the oldest depictions shows the bull <b>standing</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> goddess' standard; since it has 3 stars depicted on its back (the cuneiform sign for [...] "star-constellation"), {{there is good reason}} to regard this as the constellation later known as Taurus.|$|E

500|$|The Acra was not {{the first}} Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem. Sources {{indicate}} that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic Baris, had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts. Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the Antonia Fortress. The Baris fell to AntiochusIII {{at the turn of the}} 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt. Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege. These factors, coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an acra, have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure. Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case. Antiquities of the Jews 12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the [...] "impious or wicked" [...] had [...] "remained" [...] rather than [...] "dwelt" [...] in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been <b>standing</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.|$|E
500|$|The {{paintings}} show Obrenović <b>standing</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Serb {{leaders and}} clan elders at Takovo and inciting them to revolt. According to legend, he {{appeared before the}} crowd and proclaimed: [...] "Here I am, and here you are. War to the Turks!". Obrenović is depicted standing atop a large stone, wearing a turban and a red, Oriental-style costume covered in golden embroidery, surrounded by a semi-circle of followers. A sword hangs from his waist, and two pistols protrude from his belt. His right arm points up at the sky, with the thumb, middle and index finger extended. With his left hand outstretched, Obrenović waves a large revolutionary flag depicting a red cross centered against a white background. The flag is a variant of that used by the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty, which ruled Montenegro {{at the time of}} the uprising, and is reminiscent of the Christian flag flown at the Battle of Kosovo, which according to popular belief, marked the beginning of the Ottoman occupation of the Balkans. The flag provokes an enthusiastic response from the crowd, members of which raise their swords in salute. Others gesture with their muskets. To the far left, a woman places her child on top of a headstone, and both raise their hands in salute. Beside Obrenović is a priest who gives him his blessing. The priest is bearded, and wears a typical, long black robe and Eastern Orthodox religious headdress. Behind the priest is a large group of Obrenović's followers, most with their swords sheathed and hands emulating Obrenović's three-fingered gesture. To Obrenović's right, a man wearing Turkish clothes (red fez, dolman and shalvar pants) places his hand on the flagpole the rebel leader is holding. It is unclear if the man wishes to take the flag away from Obrenović or help bear it. Behind him, a large group of mustachioed men wearing similar clothes raise their arms and salute Obrenović.|$|E
500|$|The {{month of}} March kicked off with charges {{from the media}} that McCarthy's {{campaign}} was just dragging along. Cited was his tardiness to the Senate floor, which failed to prevent a Southern filibuster against a civil rights bill drafted by fellow Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale. Despite the setback, three precincts in Minnesota elected McCarthy supported delegates to caucuses, {{to the detriment of}} Vice-President Hubert Humphrey, and President Johnson decided to abandon Massachusetts, giving 72 delegates to McCarthy. He described the news as [...] "encouraging." [...] At this point, McCarthy had spent a large amount of time campaigning in New Hampshire, hoping to improve his <b>standing</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> state's critical primary. Meanwhile, President Johnson's campaign circulated the slogan that [...] "the communists in Vietnam are watching the New Hampshire primary...don't vote for fuzzy thinking and surrender." [...] McCarthy likened this statement to McCarthyism, a reference to Senator Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin. [...] Opinion polls prior to the New Hampshire primary showed that McCarthy's support stood at only 10 to 20 percent. Although he did not win the contest, he stunned spectators of the race by winning a surprising 42.2 percent of the vote to Johnson's 49.4 percent. Media outlets described the results as a [...] "moral victory" [...] for McCarthy, [...] and influenced Robert Kennedy's decision to enter the race on March 16. [...] Kennedy's announcement did not affect McCarthy's campaign. He remained committed to the [...] "young people" [...] who had supported his campaign all along, and remarked that he was [...] "better qualified to run for the presidency" [...] than Kennedy. McCarthy set his sights on Wisconsin and began to prepare for the state's April primary. He ran advertisements in newspapers throughout the state and included his platform. In it, he called for [...] "more federal aid for education," [...] collective bargaining rights for farmers, [...] "a guaranteed minimum livable income for all Americans," [...] the construction of [...] "at least one million new housing units each year, and more [...] "federal funds to stop pollution." [...] While in Wisconsin, he criticized the government of South Vietnam, saying that it would be [...] "too kind" [...] to label the entity as corrupt and a dictatorship. He then announced his intentions to enter the primaries in Indiana and Florida, and hoped to compete in California in the upcoming months. On March 31, President Johnson made the surprise announcement that he was dropping out of the race and would not seek to be renominated for the presidency.|$|E
