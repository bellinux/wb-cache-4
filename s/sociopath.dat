5|$|Trevor is {{depicted}} as a <b>sociopath</b> in Grand Theft Auto V. He is relentless and easily kills without remorse. However, he is honest about everything and rarely shows hypocrisy, which he often points out in others. He appears to be very insecure about {{having grown up in}} Canada, and takes offence to people mocking his accent. Despite his sociopathic actions, Trevor is very emotional; he seems to care about people very close to him, and he can be truly loyal to them. These people include his mother, Ashley Butler, Patricia Madrazo, Maude, Michael De Santa and his children Tracey and Jimmy, Lamar Davis, Ron, Lester, Wade and Franklin Clinton. Nevertheless, the other characters regard Trevor as dangerously unstable; during the prologue, Michael leads Trevor into a trap where he is supposed to be shot and killed, and later implores Franklin to plead insanity if he is ever arrested with Trevor. It is implied that the knowledge and extent of Trevor's crimes, the belief that Trevor's depravity escalated without anyone to keep him in check and his silence on the matter all weigh heavily on Michael's conscience.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sociopaths</b> and narcissists {{frequently}} use gaslighting tactics. <b>Sociopaths</b> consistently transgress social mores, break laws, {{and exploit}} others, but typically also are convincing liars, sometimes charming ones, who consistently deny wrongdoing. Thus, {{some who have}} been victimized by <b>sociopaths</b> may doubt their own perceptions. Some physically abusive spouses may gaslight their partners by flatly denying {{that they have been}} violent. Gaslighting may occur in parent-child relationships, with either parent, child, or both, lying to each other and attempting to undermine perceptions.|$|R

The trilogy was greeted with general acclaim, with the Oxonian Review declaring that [...] "Awkwardness is just what a work of philosophy should be", and Scott Berkun describing Why We Love <b>Sociopaths</b> as [...] "a second cousin to Postman’s classic Amusing Ourselves to Death."

For example, Porco lied to obtain both a car and tuition payments. Michele McKay, a law clerk who worked with Peter Porco, said he had described his youngest son as a <b>sociopath.</b> Several Albany-area psychologists and mental health professors have stated to the Times Union that Porco's behavior was consistent with that of a <b>sociopath.</b> In particular, they focused on a consistent pattern of lies Porco told to convince acquaintances that he was from a wealthy and influential family.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the separate but overlapping constructs of psychopathy, sociopathy, and antisocial personality disorder from evolutionary, genetic, neurological, and sociological perspectives. Evidence indicates that psychopaths are a stable proportion of any population, can be from any segment of society, may constitute a distinct taxonomical class forged by frequency‐dependent natural selection, {{and that the}} muting of the social emotions is the proximate mechanism that enables psychopaths to pursue their self‐centered goals without felling the pangs of guilt. <b>Sociopaths</b> are more the products of adverse environmental experiences that affect autonomic nervous system and neurological development {{that may lead to}} physiological responses similar to those of psychopaths. Antisocial personality disorder is a legal/clinical label that may be applied to both psychopaths and <b>sociopaths...</b>|$|R
