5|$|The Austrian troops {{advanced}} from Alessandria eastwards {{across the}} Bormida river by two bridges debouching {{in a narrow}} bend of the river (the river being not easily crossed elsewhere). Poor Austrian staff work prevented any rapid development of their attack and the entire army had to file through a narrow bridgehead. The movement began about 6 am with the first <b>shots</b> <b>fired</b> around 8 am, but the attack was not fully developed until 9 am.|$|E

5|$|Witnesses at {{the scene}} {{described}} several intermittent <b>shots</b> <b>fired</b> from both sides before the lines of regulars began to fire volleys without receiving orders to do so. A few of the militiamen believed at first that the regulars were only firing powder with no ball, but when they realized the truth, few {{if any of the}} militia managed to load and return fire. The rest ran for their lives.|$|E
5|$|Lépine {{continued}} into the second-floor corridor and wounded three students before entering another room where he twice attempted to shoot a female student. His weapon failed to fire so he entered the emergency staircase where he was seen reloading his gun. He returned to the room he had just left, but the students had locked the door; Lépine failed to unlock it with three <b>shots</b> <b>fired</b> into the door. Moving along the corridor he shot at others, wounding one, before moving towards the financial services office where he shot and killed a woman {{through the window of}} the door she had just locked.|$|E
5|$|The damage Vertu {{had taken}} {{early in the}} combat {{rendered}} Lhermitte unable to continue the action, and his ship gradually {{fell out of the}} line to the south. Captain Pierre Julien Tréhouart turned Cybèle away too, using sweeps to reach Vertu and take the ship under tow. With Vertu secured and Arrogant slowly coming back into range, Sercey ordered his squadron to turn away to the north at 10:55, the last <b>shots</b> <b>fired</b> at long range from Victorious at 11:15.|$|E

The squadron then returned for one more pass, the final <b>shots</b> <b>fired</b> by Donegal, before Stopford ordered them to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Fénix was {{commissioned}} under Captain John Carter Allen in February 1780 and renamed HMS Gibraltar on 23April. She joined George Darby's fleet in the English Channel until 29November, {{when she left}} for Samuel Hood's squadron in the West Indies under Captain Walter Stirling. In 1781, under Captain Charles Knatchbull, Gibraltar became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Francis Samuel Drake and {{was present at the}} Capture of St Eustatius in February. Following the outbreak of war between the Dutch Republic and Britain in December 1780, Rodney received orders from London to seize the island. A British expedition of 3,000 troops from St Lucia, under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir John Vaughan, arrived off St Eustatius on 3February 1781. Rodney, in command of the naval forces, positioned his fleet so as to neutralise any shore batteries, but instead of disembarking the troops and launching an immediate assault, Rodney sent a message to Governor Johannes de Graaff suggesting that he surrender to avoid bloodshed. DeGraaff agreed to the proposal and capitulated. The only <b>shots</b> <b>fired</b> were from Gibraltar and , both of which, without orders, briefly engaged Mars, the only Dutch warship in the roadstead.|$|E
5|$|The hearing never occurred, as {{the black}} militiamen, outnumbered and outgunned, refused to attend court. This upset the white mob, which {{expected}} an apology. Butler demanded that the militiamen give one, {{and as part of}} the apology, surrender their arms. Those who attempted to mediate found that neither Butler nor the armed men who backed him were interested in compromise. If the militiamen surrendered their arms, they would be helpless before the mob; if they did not, Butler and his men would use force. Butler brought additional men in from Georgia, and the augmented armed mob, including Tillman, went to confront the militiamen, who were barricaded in their drill room, above a local store. Shots were fired, and after one white man was killed, the rest stormed the room and captured about thirty of the militia. Five were murdered as having white enemies; among the dead was a town constable who had arrested white men. The rest were allowed to flee, with <b>shots</b> <b>fired</b> after them. At least seven black militiamen were killed in the incident. On the way home to Edgefield, Tillman and others had a meal to celebrate the events at the home of the man who had pointed out which African Americans should be shot.|$|E
