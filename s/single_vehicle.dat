5|$|Tillingbourne began {{operations}} with a <b>single</b> <b>vehicle,</b> expanding to operate around 70 buses by 2001. A range of types were operated, including early Thornycroft and Dennis vehicles, and later Guy and Bedford products. The company's fleet was updated in the 1990s with new Volvo and Optare vehicles. Following Tillingbourne's closure, its fleet was disposed of, with vehicles sold to Shamrock Coaches, Norfolk Green, Black Prince Buses, Safeguard Coaches, Arriva Guildford & West Surrey and Islwyn Borough Transport.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} three modes: Championship, Single Rally, and Single Stage. The Championship mode {{is split}} into a eight rallies, each composed of either twelve or twenty-four stages. To win a rally, the player must attain the lowest total time against the computer drivers. The total time {{is taken as}} the summation of each individual stage time. Players begin {{the game with a}} <b>single</b> <b>vehicle,</b> the Ford Focus RS WRC; three additional cars—the Subaru Impreza WRX, the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, and the Lancia Stratos—can be unlocked by placing first in the championship rallies. During a race, vehicles can sustain damage from collisions, which can subsequently be repaired at intervals after every two events.|$|E

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand in traffic monitoring of densely populated urban areas. In our approach we use a priori information of roads location and focus on vehicle queues detection. In this imagery <b>single</b> <b>vehicles</b> are merged to either dark or bright ribbons and therefore can hardly be separated. The queues can be extracted as lines in scale space using a differential geometric approach. We exploit the fact that vehicle queues show repetitive pattern. This pattern is also observably in width profile of the queues derived from the gradient image. For discrimination of <b>single</b> <b>vehicles</b> the variations of the width profile will be analyzed.

40|$|Vehicle {{detection}} {{is motivated}} by different fields of application, e. g. traffic flow management, road planning or estimation of air and noise pollution. Therefore, an algorithm that automatically detects and counts vehicles in air- or space-borne images would effectively support these traffic-related analyses in urban planning. Due to the small vehicle size in satellite images detection of <b>single</b> <b>vehicles</b> would deliver ambiguous results. Hence, our scheme focuses primarily on the extraction of vehicle queues, as the pattern of a queue makes it better distinguishable (as a whole) from similar objects. Hypotheses for queues are generated by sophisticated extraction of ribbons. Within these ribbons <b>single</b> <b>vehicles</b> are searched for by least-squares fitting of Gaussian kernels to the width and contrast function of a ribbon. Based on the resulting parameter values, false and correct hypotheses are discerned. The {{results show that the}} analysis of width and contrast information using least square optimization is able to extract <b>single</b> <b>vehicles</b> from queues with high correctness. Still, the completeness of the overall extraction is relatively low, since only queues can be extracted but no isolated vehicles. The results clearly show that the approach is promising but further improvements are necessary to achieve a higher completeness. 1. 1 Motivation 1...|$|R

25|$|The {{idea was}} to build an {{offshore}} terminal with docks equipped with Dashaveyor tracks instead of a conventional container shipping port on land. An operator would load containers onto Dashaveyor cars, which would then enter a tunnel to move them at high speed to the shore. There they would exit the tunnel and automatically drive the container to its storage location, and optionally lift it to stack them. In a Dashaveyor equipped port, a <b>single</b> <b>vehicle</b> would pick up, move and stack the containers. Normally each of these steps required a separate, manned, vehicle. Additionally, the ships never had to enter port, which had major advantages in terms of siting and construction.|$|E

Both groups contributed at a higher rate to air pollution reduction through average <b>single</b> occupant <b>vehicle</b> miles reduced than non-school employees. Two inexpensive measures, a guaranteed ride home and prize drawings, were statistically related to a reduced percentage of <b>single</b> occupant <b>vehicle</b> commutes for non-school employees. Both measures were found to be statistically related with trip reduction in metropolitan Los Angeles.

25|$|The Malaysian Army {{placed an}} order for 186 SIBMAS {{vehicles}} in 1981, {{as part of an}} $84 million deal with Belgium. This was accomplished under the auspices of Perkembangan Istimewa Angkatan Tentera (PERISTA), a general programme to greatly expand the firepower and mechanized capabilities of the Malaysian security forces, {{due in part to the}} ongoing communist insurgency and the escalating threat of a regional conflict between Thailand and Vietnam. Production of the SIBMAS for Malaysia began that year and concluded by 1985. About 162 SIBMAS AFSV-90s were manufactured, the remaining 24 being recovery vehicles with front and rear spades, a power winch, and a large, folding crane. The AFSV-90 replaced the Panhard AML, V-100 Commando, and Panhard M3 in Malaysian service, since it was able to more effectively combine the traditionally separate roles of an armoured car and an armoured personnel carrier onto a <b>single</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E

25|$|Early 1917 one vehicle {{had been}} {{delivered}} to Italy. The tank {{had been ordered}} by the Italians after Captain Alfredo Bennicelli had observed the first French Army testing in September 1916; the <b>single</b> <b>vehicle</b> was in 1917 tested and deployed on the Kras front. It made a favourable impression and in the Autumn of 1917 the Italian High Command desired either the purchase of twenty Schneiders or the tooling capable of producing them. This plan was abandoned after the heavy defeat of the Italian Army at the Battle of Caporetto. Its High Command now envisaged the equipment with a far larger number of tanks, demanding the import or manufacture of about 1500 Schneiders. After it had become clear that the French industry {{did not have the}} spare capacity to meet those demands and that they far out-reached the possibilities of domestic production, it was decided to produce the cheaper and more modern FIAT 3000 instead, a copy of the Renault FT, three of which had been received in May 1918.|$|E
25|$|L11 - Built in 1964 {{from two}} 1931 Standard Stock {{vehicles}} (numbers 3080 and 3109), this vehicle {{followed the same}} concept as L10, as both donor vehicles had some of their passenger compartments cut off and the two cabs and control sections were joined back to back. The resulting locomotive was a <b>single</b> <b>vehicle</b> Bo-Bo. A small section of the passenger compartment remained, {{and most of the}} air system and braking equipment was moved into it from beneath the frames, so that it could be more easily maintained. The vehicle had four WT54A motors, which were wired so that each pair remained permanently in series. Thus they worked at half voltage, but the slow-speed characteristics were better-suited for shunting. Dual couplings for tube and sub-surface stock were fitted at the Acton end only. The front door was blocked off, but had a low-level screen, to enable the driver to see the couplings more easily. When first built, it carried a maroon livery, but was painted yellow in 1983. It saw use until the early 1990s and since preservation in 2004, has been on display outside Epping tube station.|$|E
500|$|Tillingbourne {{was formed}} in 1924 by Vic Smith and George Trice. It was {{initially}} known as Tillingbourne Valley, and operated a <b>single</b> <b>vehicle</b> in a maroon livery from a garage in Chilworth on a service between Guildford and Gomshall. Smith left the company in the late 1920s, and a new route from Guildford to Albury Park was introduced around the same time, with four vehicles owned by 1928. The route to Gomshall was extended to Peaslake, and briefly faced competition from Surrey Hills Motor Services prior to their takeover by Aldershot & District, who withdrew the competing route. The company's garage was rebuilt after being destroyed in a fire along with three of its vehicles in 1928. Tillingbourne was reconstituted as a limited company, Tillingbourne Valley Services Limited, in October 1931.|$|E
