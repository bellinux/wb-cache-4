40|$|This {{study is}} an {{examination}} of the <b>private</b> <b>duty</b> <b>nursing</b> field of employment between the years 1910 – 1965. The <b>private</b> <b>duty</b> field, in which nurses contracted individually with patients for delivery of nursing services, existed as the major occupational field for professional nurses {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century. This study focuses on the distribution of <b>private</b> <b>duty</b> <b>nurses</b> through the professional nurse registry system. Professional nurse registries, operated by or in close affiliation with professional nurse associations, served as agencies to connect patients with nurses and nurses with patient. ^ Primary source data analyzed for this study were obtained from the archival records of four professional nurse registries, which operated in New York City and Chicago, and four professional nurses associations associated with the registries. Data examined included minutes of meetings, statistical reports, financial records correspondence, legal documents, and printed materials used in the operations of the registries. Journal articles, books, studies and investigations carried out on nursing, and newspaper accounts pertinent to the <b>private</b> <b>duty</b> field were analyzed. ^ <b>Private</b> <b>duty</b> <b>nursing</b> was the occupational field in which most early twentieth century working nurses obtained jobs. It was in the <b>private</b> <b>duty</b> field that <b>nurses</b> established patterns which determined nurse compensation and other conditions of work. Professional associations, by operating <b>private</b> <b>duty</b> registries, joined with working nurses in negotiating and developing methods used to establish relationships with hospitals, physicians, and other groups important to the delivery of health care services. The contemporary nurse labor market 2 ̆ 7 s characteristics were shaped in numerous ways by the activities of previous generations of <b>private</b> <b>duty</b> <b>nurses.</b> ^ <b>Private</b> <b>duty</b> <b>nursing</b> was an expensive system of nurse distribution in which professional nurses competed with numerous lesser-trained nurse workers for patients and jobs. This study examines the problems nurses encountered as they attempted to secure a firm place in the nurse labor market. Solutions used by nurses to seize control of the labor market are identified. Conclusions are reached as to why nurses either failed to command more influence over their work situation or succeeded in achieving acceptable work situations. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Private</b> <b>duty</b> <b>nursing</b> {{plummeted}} {{from being}} the pinnacle of a nurse's carrer in 1900 to being almost non-existent by the 1970 's. This paper explores the nature of <b>private</b> <b>duty</b> <b>nursing</b> in the 1960 's and 1970 's and seeks to identify factors contributing {{to the demise of}} this avenue of work. Three former nurses from Rockhampton, Queensland, were interviewed as part of an oral history project. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed within a historical context. The main factors identified as impacting on private nursing by the 1970 's were the opening up of opportunities for married nurses to gain part-time employment in hospitals, the increasing level of technology associated with high dependancy patients, and improved wages and conditions of hospital nurses. While many of the factors relating to the decline of <b>private</b> <b>duty</b> <b>nursing</b> are no longer relevant, other issues that emerged from this study, such as professional isolation, working environments and the ability of the patient to pay for nursing services, warrant consideration by contemporary nurses entering private practice...|$|R

50|$|The major {{religious}} denominations {{were active}} in establishing hospitals in many cities. Several Catholic orders of nuns specialized in nursing roles.

This enabled hospitals like St. Vincent's Hospital in New York, where nurses from the Sisters of Charity began their work in 1849; patients of all backgrounds were welcome, but most came from the low-income Catholic population.|$|R

One of her most notable contributions to the system of nursing education was the implementation of a grading policy for nursing students. Students would need to prove their competency in order to receive qualifications.
