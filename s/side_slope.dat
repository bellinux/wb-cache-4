25|$|To the {{north-east}} the fell {{is separated}} from Skiddaw by Carlside Col (2,345ft), a depression that contains Carlside Tarn, the only standing water found at any altitude in the Skiddaw group. Very shallow and frequently dry in summer, the tarn has no plant life. Set in a particularly windy location, the slight retaining bank at the south-eastern edge may be in danger of erosion. The Skiddaw side of the col is a rough scree slope while the Carl <b>Side</b> <b>slope</b> is gentler and grassed.|$|E
25|$|The engine {{compartment}} {{is located in}} the rear of the vehicle and consists of: a 2V-06-02 water-cooled diesel engine developing 450hp, a main clutch, a gearbox, a final drives, and brakes. The suspension of the vehicle consists of five rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear, an idler at the front, and four track-return rollers. The BMD-3 is fitted with a new hydromechanical transmission with hydrostatic steering mechanism. This adjustable suspension gives a ground clearance between 130 and 530mm with 450mm being the default. This hydropneumatic suspension allows the BMD-3 to decrease its height to be able to board transport aircraft like the Il-76M. The ground clearance is adjusted by the driver and it takes 10 seconds to lower or raise the suspension. The maximum road speed is 70km/h and the maximum off-road speed is 45km/h. The vehicle can achieve an operational range of up to 500km on paved roads and can climb up to 60% gradient and move on a 30% <b>side</b> <b>slope.</b> The ground pressure exerted by the BMD-3 is 0.48 kg/cm2 with standard tracks and 0.32kg/cm2 with broader tracks.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessor, the BMD-4 {{is capable}} of {{parachuting}} from aircraft with the entire crew and passengers inside the vehicle which allows target engagement after landing to be instant. An Il-76 is able to transport two of these vehicles {{at a time in}} comparison to three BMD-1s and BMD-2s. Its engine is the 2V-06-2; the same as the BMD-3. This engine develops a total power of 450 horsepower (hp). The BMD-4 is also fully amphibious with two water jets mounted {{on each side of the}} back of the hull and can swim at speeds of up to 10km/h in a Beaufort scale of 2. With a high power-to-weight ratio, the BMD-4 features superior acceleration in comparison to other infantry fighting vehicles. The maximum speed on a highway is 70km/h and the BMD-4 can maneuver on a 60° gradient and a 35° <b>side</b> <b>slope.</b> The BMD-4 can cross 1.8 m trenches and climb 0.8 m tall obstacles. This vehicle's suspension is hydropneumatic and giving an adjustable ground clearing of 130–530mm with the normal road clearance being 450mm. The clearance is changed by the driver and can be changed within 10 seconds.|$|E

60|$|I {{can give}} little {{information}} regarding the kinds of corals which live on the outer margin. When I visited the reef at Tahiti, although it was low water, the surf was too violent {{for me to see}} the living masses; but, according to what I heard from some intelligent native chiefs, they resemble in their rounded and branchless forms, those on the margin of Keeling atoll. The extreme verge of the reef, which was visible between the breaking waves at low water, consisted of a rounded, convex, artificial-like breakwater, entirely coated with Nulliporae, and absolutely similar to that which I have described at Keeling atoll. From what I heard when at Tahiti, and from the writings of the Revs. W. Ellis and J. Williams, I conclude that this peculiar structure is common to most of the encircled islands of the Society Archipelago. The reef within this mound or breakwater, has an extremely irregular surface, even more so than between the islets on the reef of Keeling atoll, with which alone (as there are no islets on the reef of Tahiti) it can properly be compared. At Tahiti, the reef is very irregular in width; but round many other encircled islands, for instance, Vanikoro or Gambier Islands (Figures 1 and 8, Plate I.), it is quite as regular, and of the same average width, as in true atolls. Most barrier-reefs on the inner <b>side</b> <b>slope</b> irregularly into the lagoon-channel (as the space of deep water separating the reef from the included land may be called), but at Vanikoro the reef slopes only for a short distance, and then terminates abruptly in a submarine wall, forty feet high,--a structure absolutely similar to that described by Chamisso in the Marshall atolls.|$|E
