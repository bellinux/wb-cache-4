25|$|In a {{more recent}} work, {{historian}} David Tucker (1998) attempts to rehabilitate the Mugwumps. According to Tucker, the Mugwumps embodied the liberalism of the 19th century, and their rejection by 20th-century historians, who embraced the government intervention of the New Deal and the Great <b>Society,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> surprising. To Tucker, their eloquent writings speak for themselves, and are testament to a high minded civic morality.|$|E
25|$|The American {{economist}} Henry Charles Carey rejected Malthus's {{argument in}} his magnum opus of 1858–59, The Principles of Social Science. Carey {{maintained that the}} only {{situation in which the}} means of subsistence will determine population growth is one in which a given <b>society</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> introducing new technologies or not adopting forward-thinking governmental policy, and that population regulated itself in every well-governed society, but its pressure on subsistence characterized the lower stages of civilization.|$|E
25|$|According to the naturalistic view, the flourishing of <b>society</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> {{or not the}} only, {{intrinsically}} good thing. Defenses of {{this notion}} are often formulated by reference to biology, and observations that living things compete more with their own kind than with other kinds. Rather, what is of intrinsic good is the flourishing of all sentient life, extending to those animals that have some level of similar sentience, such as Great Ape personhood. Others go farther, declaring that life itself is of intrinsic value.|$|E

25|$|Notwithstanding some {{mitigating}} themes, the Catholic Church banned The Prince, {{putting it}} on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Humanists also viewed the book negatively, including Erasmus of Rotterdam. As a treatise, its primary intellectual contribution {{to the history of}} political thought is the fundamental break between political realism and political idealism, due to it being a manual on acquiring and keeping political power. In contrast with Plato and Aristotle, Machiavelli insisted that an imaginary ideal <b>society</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a model by which a prince should orient himself.|$|E
25|$|The {{religious}} and cultural definition requires Pashtuns to be Muslim and adhere to Pashtunwali codes. This is the most prevalent view among orthodox and conservative tribesmen, who refuse to recognise any non-Muslim as a Pashtun. Pashtun intellectuals and academics, however, {{tend to be more}} flexible and sometimes define who is Pashtun based on other criteria. Pashtun <b>society</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> homogenous by religion: the overwhelming majority of them are Sunni, with a tiny Shia community (the Turi and partially the Bangash tribe) in the Kurram and Orakzai agencies of FATA, Pakistan. Pakistani Jews and Afghan Jews, have largely relocated to Israel and the United States.|$|E

In one incident during the Culture-Idiran War, they strive to avoid offending a civilization so advanced that it has disengaged from Galactic politics, and note that this hyper-advanced <b>society</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a threat to either the welfare or {{the values of the}} Culture. In Excession, an overwhelmingly more powerful individual from an extremely advanced civilization is simply passing through on its way from one plane of the physical Reality to another, and there is no real interaction. In the third case it sets up teams to study a civilization that is not threatening but is thought to have eliminated aggressors in the past.|$|E

500|$|One critic {{points out}} that the {{marketing}} agency Blue Ant is named after the wasp Blue Ant: [...] "it's a wasp with a painful sting. The female hunts for a ground-dwelling cricket. She paralyses it with a sting and lays her egg on it. The still living yet immobile cricket becomes food for the wasp's young. What a clever metaphor for the process of targeting, commodifying, and marketing cool." [...] On the other hand, as Rudy Rucker notes, while new art is constantly threatened by commodification, it is dependent on the monoculture for its launching point and uniqueness. Gibson's product positioning language and Cayce's analysis of consumerist trends show that <b>society</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a victim of consumerism, but rather its creator who helps shape it without ever stepping outside it. [...] Alex Link argues that rather than a simple attack on consumerism outright, the novel outlines a complex interrelationship between art, brand design, and terrorism as varying attitudes to history, terror, and community.|$|E
500|$|Goffman {{describes}} the theatrical performances {{that occur in}} face-to-face interactions. He holds that when an individual comes in contact with another person, he attempts to control or guide {{the impression that the}} other person will form of him, by altering his own setting, appearance and manner. [...] At the same time, the person that the individual is interacting with attempts to form an impression of, and obtain information about, the individual. Goffman also believes that participants in social interactions engage in certain practices to avoid embarrassing themselves or others. <b>Society</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> homogeneous; we must act differently in different settings. This recognition led Goffman to his dramaturgical analysis. He saw a connection between the kinds of [...] "acts" [...] that people put on in their daily lives and theatrical performances. In a social interaction, as in a theatrical performance, there is an onstage area where actors (individuals) appear before the audience; this is where positive self-concepts and desired impressions are offered. But there is, as well, a backstage – a hidden, private area where individuals can be themselves and drop their societal roles and identities.|$|E

2500|$|But the {{availability}} of a technology of literacy to a <b>society</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough to ensure its widespread diffusion and use. [...] For example, Eric Havelock observed in A Preface to Plato that after the ancient Greeks invented writing they adopted a scribal culture that lasted for generations. [...] Few people, other than the scribes, considered it necessary to learn to read or write. [...] In other societies, such as ancient Egypt or medieval Europe, literacy has been a domain confined to political and religious elites.|$|E

"If {{the peasant}} {{doctrine}} {{admits that the}} basis of its policies is class-focused, its concept of human <b>society</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> class-based and its ideas are less class-based than those of any other party. The other parties label themselves [...] "socially harmonious", taking pride in themselves as national, fusing in their concerns the interests of all citizens. The peasant doctrine knows that they are, in reality, class-based parties, and, if it opposes them, it is precisely because of a national necessity, in order to ensure the normal social development of the people.|$|E

2500|$|Exposure to {{neurotoxins}} in <b>society</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> new, as civilizations {{have been}} exposed to neurologically destructive compounds for thousands of years. One notable example is the possible significant lead exposure during the Roman Empire resulting from the development of extensive plumbing networks and the habit of boiling vinegared wine in lead pans to sweeten it, the process generating lead acetate, known as [...] "sugar of lead". [...] In part, neurotoxins have been part of human history because of the fragile and susceptible nature of the nervous system, making it highly prone to disruption.|$|E

In the good home there is equality, consideration, co-operation, and helpfulness. Applied to the great people's and citizens' home this would mean the breaking down of all {{the social and economic}} barriers that now separate citizens into the privileged and the neglected, into the rulers and the dependents, into the rich and the poor, the propertied and the impoverished, the plunderers and the plundered. Swedish <b>society</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> yet the people's home. There is a formal equality, equality of political rights, but from a social perspective, the class society remains, and from an economic perspective the dictatorship of the few prevails" [...] (Hansson 1928).|$|E
2500|$|For Max Weber, a {{so-called}} [...] "legal rational form" [...] {{as a type}} of domination within <b>society,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> attributable to people but to abstract norms. He understood the body of coherent and calculable law in terms of a rational-legal authority. Such coherent and calculable law formed a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state and developed in parallel with the growth of capitalism. Central to the development of modern law is the formal rationalisation of law on the basis of general procedures that are applied equally and fairly to all. Modern rationalised law is also codified and impersonal in its application to specific cases. In general, Weber's standpoint can be described as an external approach to law that studies the empirical characteristics of law, as opposed to the internal perspective of the legal sciences and the moral approach of the philosophy of law.|$|E
