50|$|Dual Tension Restorer (DTR) {{can be used}} {{either as}} a {{bi-directional}} restoration device or as a tugger. It is a simple device which {{is very easy to}} use and easy to clean. It is almost entirely made up of nylon. It consists of a pusher plate attached to shaft on which the nylon bell can move freely. The bell is also fitted with a tension holding screw by which the bell can be fixed in place. There is a silicone gripper which holds the foreskin in place. The bell also has two nylon screws by which rubber bands are held in place which is passed through the shaft. The rubber band provides the required tension. The shaft with the pusher plate can be removed and replaced by a rod with a ring with hook in this arrangement it {{can be used as a}} tugger.DTR has two kinds of grippers; one is simple and the other has holes which provides a good hold on the foreskin.The tension on the foreskin by DTR depends mainly on the size of the <b>shaft</b> <b>rod</b> and the size & strength of the rubber band.|$|E

Using flatrods it was possible to operate man engines and pumping systems, even though the water wheel in question had a rotary, not a reciprocal, motion. So that the rods could be made to move in a reciprocal fashion, a change of direction had to be achieved by means of specially shaped components. The components of the system that were mounted in the mining shaft were called <b>shaft</b> <b>rods</b> (Schachtgestänge) or pump rods (Hubgestänge). Systems mounted in drift mines were called drift rods (Streckengestänge).|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} many reasons to {{consider}} a re-engineering of engineering education. New materials, new design, new manufacturing and assembly processes and methods, new models, new tools, and new application areas. We will first {{focus is on the}} implication on regular university education from these factors and from the Bologna process initiated in Europe for university education in general. Then we will elaborate on what this means to the actors in continuing engineering education. Background Engineering education has slightly different traditions in different countries [1]. In Sweden, the roots are from the mining schools in the early eighteen hundreds. Initially the education was mainly practical but during the 20 th century, there was a gradual shift towards theory and science. Today there is rather little direct connection between the academic curricula {{and the role of the}} professional engineer in industry. Science and math are the core components of the first two years in the curricula. The rationale is that the engineer is expected to use equations and formulas to be able to compute dimension or values of beams, <b>shafts,</b> <b>rods,</b> columns, resistors, conductors, etc., for each component or syste...|$|R
40|$|The {{grasping}} instruments used in {{minimally invasive}} surgery reduce {{the ability of the}} surgeon to feel the forces applied on the tissue, thereby complicating the handling of the tissue and increasing the risk of tissue damage. Force sensors implemented in the forceps of the instruments enable accurate measurements of applied forces, but also complicate the design of the instrument. Alternatively, indirect estimations of tissue interaction forces from measurements of the forces applied on the handle are prone to errors due to friction in the linkages. Further, the force transmission from handle to forceps exhibits large nonlinearities, so that extensive calibration procedures are needed. The kinematic analysis of the grasping mechanism and experimental results presented in this paper show that an intermediate solution, force measurements at the <b>shaft</b> and <b>rod</b> of the grasper, enables accurate measurements of the pinch and pull forces on tissue with {{only a limited number of}} calibration measurements. We further show that the force propagation from the <b>shaft</b> and <b>rod</b> to the forceps can be approximated by a linear two-dimensional function of the opening angle of the grasper and the force on the rod.

50|$|The {{original}} ram BOPs of the 1920s {{were simple}} and rugged manual devices with minimal parts. The BOP housing (body) had a vertical well bore and horizontal ram cavity (ram guide chamber). Opposing rams (plungers) in the ram cavity translated horizontally, actuated by threaded ram <b>shafts</b> (piston <b>rods)</b> {{in the manner}} of a screw jack. Torque from turning the ram shafts by wrench or hand wheel was converted to linear motion and the rams, coupled to the inner ends of the ram shafts, opened and closed the well bore.

Cylindrical grinding or abrasive machining {{is the most popular}} machining process of removing metal from a work piece surface in the form of tiny chips by the action of irregularly shaped abrasive particles.
