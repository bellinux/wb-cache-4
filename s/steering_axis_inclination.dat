50|$|The <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> <b>inclination</b> (SAI) is {{the angle}} between the {{centerline}} of the steering axis and vertical line from center contact area of the tire (as viewed from the front).|$|E
50|$|A MacPherson strut uses a wishbone, or a {{substantial}} compression link stabilized by a secondary link, {{which provides a}} bottom mounting point for the hub carrier or axle of the wheel. This lower arm system provides both lateral and longitudinal location of the wheel. The {{upper part of the}} hub carrier is rigidly fixed {{to the bottom of the}} outer part of the strut proper; this slides up and down the inner part of it, which extends upwards directly to a mounting in the body shell of the vehicle. The line from the strut's top mount to the bottom ball joint on the control arm gives the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> <b>inclination.</b> The strut's axis may be angled inwards from the steering axis at the bottom, to clear the tyre; this makes the bottom follow an arc when steering.|$|E
5000|$|While no current-era {{automobile}} front suspension {{incorporates a}} physical king pin, {{the angle of}} the pivot points of the steering knuckle constitute a [...] "virtual king pin" [...] about which the wheels turn. This virtual king pin angle remains a fundamental design parameter. King pin angle, virtual or physical, is sometimes referred to as it's acronym KPA, or alternatively king pin inclination (KPI), or <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> <b>inclination,</b> SAI. On most modern designs, the kingpin angle is set relative to the true vertical line, as viewed from the front or back of the vehicle. Kingpin inclination is non-adjustable, since it would change only if the wheel spindle or steering knuckles are bent. This has an important effect on the steering, making it tend to return to the straight ahead or centre position. This is because the straight ahead position is where the wheel is at its highest point relative to the suspended body of the vehicle - the weight of the vehicle tends to return the kingpin to this position. A second effect of the kingpin inclination is to set the scrub radius of the steered wheel. This is the offset between the tyre's contact point with the road surface and the projected axis of the steering down through the kingpin. If these points coincide, the scrub radius is zero. Zero scrub radius is possible without an inclined kingpin, but requires a deeply dished wheel so that the kingpin is at the centerline of the wheel. It is much more practical to incline the kingpin and use a less dished wheel, which also gives the self-centering effect. Zero scrub radius is not necessarily desirable - larger scrub radii lead to less steering effort (especially on vehicles without power steering), but more force applied to the steering components by road surface imperfections, braking, etc. Zero scrub radius isolates the steering from these effects but can lead to a [...] "dead" [...] feel for the driver which is undesirable, especially on performance vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Trail, or caster, is the {{horizontal}} distance {{from where the}} front wheel touches the ground to where the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> intersects the ground.

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> ground contact point. The <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This work {{deals with}} {{problems}} of tool <b>axis</b> <b>inclination</b> angles in ball-end milling. Tool <b>axis</b> <b>inclination</b> angle contributes to improvement of functional surface properties (surface integrity-surface roughness, residual stress, micro hardness, etc.), decreasing cutting forces and improving production. By milling with ball-end milling tool, using standard way of cutting, when work piece and cutting tool contain right angle, we have zero cutting speed on edge. At this point cutting tool only pushes material {{into the work}} piece. Here we can observe the following undesirable effects- chip contraction, increasing of cutting temperature, increasing vibrations or creation of built-up edge. These effects have negative results – low quality of surface and decreasing of tool life (in the worse case even it is pinching out). These effects can be eliminated with the tilt of cutting tool or tilt of work piece. Very important is direction of feed. If the feed is designated as pulled, the tool runs silently, and also the surface of work piece improves, as opposed to pushed tool [5]. These two ways {{can be used with}} the tool <b>axis</b> <b>inclination</b> angle in feed direction and also in pick feed direction. Also using climb milling or conventional milling has big influence on surface quality and on tool life. Keywords—CAD/CAM system, tool <b>axis</b> <b>inclination</b> angle, ballend milling, surface roughness, cutting forces. I. MILLING BY MEANS OF THE TOLL <b>AXIS</b> <b>INCLINATION</b> ANGLE Thanks to tilt of cutting tool we can change effective diameter of cutting tool and with it also effective cutting speed. Effective tool diameter (without tilt of cutting tool) can be calculated according to this mathematical expression: d 2 (d- a) eff = ⋅ a [mm] (1) p p Where: ap axial depth of cut [mm], d tool diameter [mm], deff effective tool diameter [mm]. Effective diameter of pulled cutting tool is calculated according to this mathematical expression [2]: ⎡ ⎛ d- 2 a ⎤ p ⎞ d = d ⋅ sin ⎢arccos ⎟ + β eff f ⎥ [mm] ⎝ d ⎠ ⎥...|$|R
