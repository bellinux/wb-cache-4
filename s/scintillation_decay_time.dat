For most scintillators, light output and <b>scintillation</b> <b>decay</b> <b>time</b> depends on the temperature. This dependence can largely be ignored for room-temperature applications since it is usually weak. The dependence on the temperature is also weaker for organic scintillators than it is for inorganic crystals, such as NaI-Tl or BGO. Strong dependence of decay time on the temperature in BGO scintillator is used for remote monitoring of temperature in vacuum environment. The coupled PMTs also exhibit temperature sensitivity, and can be damaged if submitted to mechanical shock. Hence, high temperature rugged PMTs should be used for high-temperature, high-vibration applications.|$|E

The multiple photon counting coincidence (MPCC) technique involves recording the sequence of individual photon pulses resulting from a scintillation event. The timing of the individual photons allows determination of the <b>scintillation</b> <b>decay</b> <b>time</b> constants.

The decay time constants and the relative light yield of CaWO 4 and ZnWO 4 scintillators have been investigated in the temperature range 9 - 350 K. An important advantage of the MPCC method is the possibility to reject spurious events through off-line analysis, taking into account the entire data set of scintillation events. This procedure allows cleaning of the data set from multiple scintillation events (pile-up).

40|$|Abstract. The {{experimental}} data are analysed {{with the following}} conclusions. The molecular decay time TO of a thin anthracene crystal lamina at room temperature is 10 nsec. The thick crystal values are increased by self-absorption to 31 6 nsec (volume excitation, e. g. by prays), 24. 1 nsec (surface excitation, e. g. by ultra-violet or ways, and emission observed by transmission) and 19. 4 nsec (surface excitation, and observation by reflection). Surface oxidation or reduction in crystal thickness yields lower values. For microcrystals of dimensions comparable with the exciton mean free path (IV. 0. 1,U), the decay time is reduced below TO due to premature conversion of excitons into photons at the crystal surface.

This note offers {{an explanation of the}} apparent discrepancies. Consider initially a thin anthracene crystal lamina, thickness do, in which the selfabsorption coefficient a (fraction of primary fluorescence photons reabsorbed in the crystal) is negligible, yet whose dimensions exceed the exciton mean free path 1 in...|$|E
40|$|For high {{resolution}} positron emission tomographs based on scintillation detectors a fast, dense, and bright scintillator is required. A sample {{of a new}} scintillator, Lu 0. 8 Y 0. 2 AlO 3 :Ce (LuYAP) with a density of 7. 7 g/cm(3) and a <b>scintillation</b> <b>decay</b> <b>time</b> of 20 and 160 ns is compared with LSO and BGO crystals {{of the same size}} to estimate the potential of the crystal for {{high resolution}} PET detectors. Special attention was paid to use an application specific measurement setup with respect to high resolution PET. The light yield of the crystals using polished crystals as well as PTFE tape and BaSO 4 as reflector material and the temperature dependence of the light yield are measured using crystals of 2 x 2 X 10 mm(3). At room temperature, the light yields of BGO : LuYAP : LSO are 1 : 1. 5 : 4. 5 with energy resolutions of 27. 4 % (BGO), 20 % (LuYAP) and 15 % (LSO), respectively. LuYAP shows an increase in light yield with increasing temperature whereas both BGO and LSO show a decrease...|$|E
40|$|The light output, α/β ratio, {{and pulse}} shape have been {{investigated}} at - 25 ^∘ C with PbWO_ 4 crystal scintillators undoped, and doped by F, Eu, Mo, Gd and S. The fast 0. 01 - 0. 06 μs and middle 0. 1 - 0. 5 μs components of <b>scintillation</b> <b>decay</b> were observed for all the samples. Slow components of scintillation signal with the <b>decay</b> <b>times</b> 1 - 3 μs and 13 - 28 μs with the total intensity up to ≈ 50...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} optical and {{scintillation}} {{properties of the}} Ce(3 +) -doped bromoelpasolites Cs(2) NaREBr(6) (RE = La,Y,Lu). The γ-ray scintillation light yield of these materials varies from 6000 to 17 [*] 000 photons per MeV absorbed γ-ray energy. At room temperature (RT), the γ-ray <b>scintillation</b> <b>decay</b> curves for all compounds show a fast component of 61  ns, whereas the intrinsic Ce(3 +) <b>decay</b> <b>time</b> is 30  ns. The scintillation mechanism in elpasolites is addressed. In Cs(2) NaLuBr(6) :Ce(3 +) and Cs(2) NaYBr(6) :Ce(3 +), we observe {{for the first time}} the so-called Ce(3 +) anomalous emission in bromide compounds. This emission previously observed for chloride compounds is an ultrafast Ce(3 +) emission with a selective excitation mechanism. The <b>decay</b> <b>time</b> of the anomalous emission at 10  K in bromide compounds (∼ 7. 80  ns) is faster than that in chloride compounds (∼ 9. 90  ns). Two bands of the anomalous emission are resolved for the first time. The mechanism behind this emission is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{luminescence}} and scintillation {{properties of}} ZnS-Ag/ 6 LiF where {{studied in the}} 7 - 295 K temperature range to evaluate the suitability of the scintillator for neutron detection at very low temperature (< 1 K). It is shown that decrease of temperature has little effect upon principal luminescence and scintillation characteristics of ZnS-Ag: the changes of emission intensity are small for photoexcitation and negligible for excitation with α-particles. The recombination kinetics of the <b>scintillation</b> <b>decay</b> exhibits modest shortening of the fast <b>decay</b> <b>time</b> constant, from 4. 52 to 3. 35 μs with cooling to 10 K. It is concluded that ZnS-Ag/ 6 LiF is a promising scintillator for cryogenic application. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
