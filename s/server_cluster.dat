Closed alpha testing was held on a small cluster for some time, with about 3,000 players chosen from an initial pool of 50,000. The Chinese open beta test began on June 13, 2006, and proved to be very popular, gaining numbers comparable to Eve Onlines main <b>server</b> <b>cluster.</b> In order to avoid the shock of quickly adding thousands of new players to the current server (Tranquility), CCP Games decided to launch Eve in China on its own server (Serenity). In 2011, CCP allowed its licensing agreement with CDC Games, which had acquired Optic in July 2007, to expire. CCP created a new partnership with TianCity to relaunch Serenity on December 11, 2012.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the problem of {{large-scale}} multimedia content delivery, we present Multimedia Content Delivery Network (MM-CDN). For providing multimedia services with high quality in MM-CDN, the traditional request routing approaches in CDN face two key challenges, namely performance and cost. To balance the tradeoff between performance and cost in MM-CDN, we propose an improved request routing approach. First, based on the idea of network coordinates, the computation and transfer costs of different <b>server</b> <b>clusters</b> are computed depending on the network and server status change. Then, all the <b>server</b> <b>clusters</b> are reorganized in the coordinate space. Finally, user requests can be adaptively redirected to the <b>server</b> <b>clusters</b> with minimum cost without sacrificing performance. Computational results show that the effectiveness of our approach with acceptable time performance...|$|R

State-of-the-art tools, most notably MapReduce, are generally performed on dedicated <b>server</b> <b>clusters</b> to explore data parallelism. For grass roots users or non-computing professionals, the cost of deploying and maintaining a large-scale dedicated <b>server</b> <b>clusters</b> can be prohibitively high, {{not to mention the}} technical skills involved.
