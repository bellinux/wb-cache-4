5|$|Pattle worked {{toward this}} goal for some time until, in late 1935, by chance, {{he picked up a}} copy of the Johannesburg Star newspaper. The paper {{contained}} an advertisement by the Royal Air Force (RAF) which was offering five-year short service commissions for cadets throughout the British Empire. The RAF expansion schemes required a great influx of capable personnel into the organisation as rearmament and the need for fighting men heightened. Pattle decided that a career in the RAF offered better prospects than as an instructor in South Africa and applied. Early in 1936, he was invited to Britain as an applicant. He flew to London at his own expense to attend the selection processes and was offered a commission by the <b>selection</b> <b>board.</b> He immediately returned to South Africa to arrange his migration to Britain and left aboard SS Llandovery Castle on 30 April 1936.|$|E

Wing <b>selection</b> <b>boards</b> now meet {{to determine}} whether a cadet will be slotted as green-light, approved, or red-light.|$|R

25|$|McNamara {{developed}} a basic set of requirements for TFX {{based largely on}} the Air Force's requirements and, on 1 September 1961, ordered the Air Force to develop it. A request for proposals (RFP) for the TFX was provided to industry in October 1961. In December, proposals were received from Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed, McDonnell, North American and Republic. The evaluation group found all the proposals lacking, but Boeing and General Dynamics were selected to submit enhanced designs. Boeing's proposal was recommended by the <b>selection</b> <b>board</b> in January 1962, {{with the exception of}} the engine, which was not considered acceptable. Switching to a crew escape capsule, instead of ejection seats and alterations to radar and missile storage were also needed. Both companies provided updated proposals in April 1962. Air Force reviewers favored Boeing's offering, while the Navy found both submissions unacceptable for its operations. Two more rounds of updates to the proposals were conducted, with Boeing being picked by the <b>selection</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E

25|$|The WOSBs were a {{precursor}} to the Army Officer <b>Selection</b> <b>Board</b> that is in place today. During World War II, WOSBs selection methods were adapted for use by armed forces all over the world, including in India and Canada.

5000|$|Applications must be {{received}} by Special Flying Programs Section HQ AFPC/DPAOT3 no later than 45 days before the <b>selection</b> <b>boards</b> meets. USAF <b>selection</b> <b>boards</b> are held once {{a year at the}} Headquarters of the Air Force Personnel Center. The boards are normally held in November, and the board selects the TPS two classes for the next year. It is at this point that AFIT-TPS students, and students for foreign TPS schools are also selected. The USAF TPS Commandant Chairs the Chair of the Board. Board members consist of a HQ AFPC Colonel, and at least a majority of the board members must be TPS graduates (Majors or Lieutenant Colonels) who are standing flight test squadron commanders.

25|$|Rickover {{found himself}} {{frequently}} and loudly in bureaucratic combat with these senior naval officers, {{to the point}} that he almost missed becoming an admiral: two <b>selection</b> <b>boards</b> passed over Captain Rickover for promotion.

It eventually took the intervention of the White House, U.S. Congress, and the Secretary of the Navy— and the very real threat of changing the Navy's admiral-selection system to include civilians— before the next flag-selection board welcomed the twice passed-over Rickover (normally a career-ending event) into their ranks.|$|R
25|$|Military Potential is an {{assessment}} of Aptitudes, Personality Traits, and the choice of occupation. Academic Performance is rated based on a student's transcript. Unlike many universities, since a complete transcript is submitted to the <b>selection</b> <b>board,</b> grade 9-11 marks are heavily weighted in a student's application with consideration given to grade 12 (or the final year's) marks. Officer Cadets are obliged to maintain satisfactory academic and military performance throughout the programme.|$|E
25|$|He {{was still}} in the Reserve of Air Force Officers on 12 June 1939, when he was {{recalled}} to duty as a squadron leader. He returned to the active list as a wing commander on 1 September 1939. In 1942 he was appointed president of the Air Crew <b>Selection</b> <b>Board,</b> then based at Cardington, Bedfordshire. He retired again on 19 April 1945. In retirement, he settled in Bexhill-on-Sea where he died on 26 August 1971.|$|E
25|$|After the war {{he became}} President of the RAF <b>Selection</b> <b>Board</b> and then Director of Weapons at the Air Ministry in 1947.

His last {{appointments}} were as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief at Transport Command in 1954 and Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief at Technical Training Command in 1955. In 1955, Beamish was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He retired in 1958.|$|E

25|$|When Sides became {{eligible}} for early promotion to rear admiral a month later, the <b>selection</b> <b>board</b> was {{perceived to be}} stacked against captains {{who had participated in}} the Revolt because it included none of the top admirals involved in the controversy. Passed over as expected, in 1950 he took command of the heavy cruiser Albany for a twelve-month tour in the Atlantic Fleet. Sides had hoped to captain the first guided-missile cruiser, which the Navy had expected to put in operation by that year, but its development schedule had slipped due to problems with the sound barrier. The first guided-missile cruiser would not become operational until 1955.|$|E
25|$|In 1946–47, Dr. Hopper {{served on}} the site <b>selection</b> <b>board</b> for the new United States Air Force Academy. Upon his return to academia in 1947, he found himself passed over for {{promotion}} above associate professor. The classified nature of most of Hopper’s research output did not help his prospects, {{as well as the}} extended time he spent away from academia with the military, two years more than most of his colleagues. Post war he shifted his teaching interests more towards air power as a factor in international affairs and did not become significantly involved in the new Russian Research Center, known today as the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.|$|E
25|$|A {{request for}} {{proposal}} (RFP) for the TFX was provided to industry in October 1961. In December of that year Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed, McDonnell, North American and Republic submitted their proposals. The proposal evaluation group found all the proposals lacking, but the best should be improved with study contracts. Boeing and General Dynamics were selected to enhance their designs. Three rounds of updates to the proposals were conducted with Boeing being picked by the <b>selection</b> <b>board.</b> Instead Secretary McNamara selected General Dynamics' proposal in November 1962 due to its greater commonality between Air Force and Navy TFX versions. The Boeing aircraft versions shared {{less than half of}} the major structural components. General Dynamics signed the TFX contract in December 1962. A Congressional investigation followed, but did not change the selection.|$|E
