40|$|Since {{there is}} a dearth of flight {{vibration}} data {{and because of the}} current wide interest in solid-propellent, rockets, flight vibration data have been obtained from five vertical test shots of <b>Shotput,</b> the launch vehicle for vertical tests of the 100 -foot inflatable sphere. The two-stage vehicle, called <b>Shotput,</b> consisted of a Pollux and two Recruit rocket motors as the first stage and an ABL X- 248 rocket motor as the second stage. High vibration levels were obtained near burnout of the second stage of <b>Shotput</b> I, II, and V, whereas only low vibration levels were noted on <b>Shotput</b> III, and IV. The peak flight vibration levels on <b>Shotput</b> I, II, and V occured in the longitudinal direction at a frequency of about 570 cps and were ± 45 g, and ± 24 g, respectively. It was found that the flight vibration levels in the normal and transverse directions were considerably less that those in the longitudinal direction. High longitudinal vibration levels were also noted during some of the ground tests of the final stage and are believed to result from a burning instability coupled with the longitudinal acoustical resonance of the rocket motor.

40|$|Advisor: David S. SenchinaWe {{analyzed}} {{gender and}} age differences in Drake Relays performance distances for 2 jumping (long jump and triplejump) and 3 throwing (discus, javelin, <b>shotput)</b> field events for 31 years (1978 - 2008). The top 10 performances were taken each year for 4 groups: high school (HS) boys, HS girls, college/university (C/U) men, C/U women. Our data set included 4403 performances total, because not all ages/genders competed in all events or for {{the same number of}} years. Generally, females significantly improved their jumping or throwing distances whereas males showed no improvements or significantly declined in performance. HS girls showed statistically significant improvements in all 3 of their events (discus, <b>shotput,</b> long jump), and C/U women showed improvements in 4 of their 5 events (discus, javelin, <b>shotput,</b> triplejump) and demonstrated no change in long jump performance. In comparison, HS boys showed no changes in 2 of their 3 events (discus and <b>shotput)</b> and significantly shorter distance in long jump, and C/U men demonstrated significantly shorter throwing or jumping distances in 4 of their 5 events (javelin, <b>shotput,</b> long jump, triplejump) and no change in discus. Despite the improvements in female performance distances, males threw or jumped further than females in all events for all years except for discus, where C/U women were out-throwing HS boys by 2008. As the Drake Relays includes athletes from across the country, these differences likely reflect national trends and are possibly explained by forces such as increased pressure for youth sport specialization, declining popularity of track-and-field, and Title IX.
