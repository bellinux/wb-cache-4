50|$|The {{majority}} of self-secreted materials {{are produced by}} insects and selection acts on this characteristic of production of self-secreting materials and increases the fitness of the animal. In some cases, the self-secreted material is directly applied, {{as in the case}} of ecribellate silk, spun by ecribellate spiders, to form sticky traps for prey, or it may be processed, {{as in the case of}} salivary excretion used for creation of paper by paper wasps, by blending it directly with wood pulp. Self-secreted materials may be processed in some cases. In cribellate spiders, silk produced by the spider are reworked in the cribellum to form fine sticky strands used for capturing prey. In other cases, the <b>scale</b> <b>wax,</b> produced on the bodies of honey bees, is gathered and blended with saliva, to form comb wax, the building material. Not all self-secreted materials are developed specifically for that purpose. For example, bird feathers are used for lining and insulation, a typical example being that of the female common eider duck (Somateria mollissima), which produces down feathers for lining its nest.|$|E

New advancements in enhanced oil recovery and gas lift processes also have been encountered to reduce asphaltene instability, which induces asphaltene precipitation and deposition (Abouie et al. 2015; Fallahnejad and Kharrat 2015; Jafari Behbahani et al. 2012; Nasrabadi et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|Background: irrigating ears {{to remove}} wax is a {{time-consuming}} procedure in UK primary care. In {{many other countries}} bulb syringes are used for self-clearance of earwax but evidence of their effectiveness is lacking. Aim: to compare the effectiveness of self-treatment bulb syringes with routine care. Design of study Open, randomised, controlled trial. Setting Seven practices in Hampshire, UK. Method: participants were 237 patients attending their GP or practice nurse with symptomatic occluding earwax. A further 128 patients {{did not want to}} be part of the randomisation but allowed their data to be analysed. Patients randomised to intervention (n = 118) were given ear drops, a bulb syringe, and instructions on its use. Patients in the control group (n = 119) received ear drops, followed by ear irrigation by the GP or practice nurse. Main outcome measures were symptoms (on a 7 -point <b>scale),</b> <b>wax</b> clearance, need for further treatment, and the acceptability of treatment. Results: comparing patients using the bulb syringe with those treated with conventional irrigation, the change in mean symptom score was - 0. 81 and - 1. 26 respectively (difference - 0. 45, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = - 0. 11 to - 0. 79) and, regarding the proportion requiring no further irrigation, 51 % and 69 % respectively. Although irrigation was preferred by more patients, most patients using the bulb syringe would use it again (75 % versus 100 %) and were satisfied with treatment (71 % versus 99 %).

40|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties have been determined on 60 samples of crude beeswax, obtained for the most part from beekeepers in California and other Western States, and these properties have been compared with those of freshly secreted <b>scale</b> <b>wax</b> and also with the properties of many of the same crude waxes after they had been decolorized by various processes. For freshly secreted beeswax the properties are nearly constant, but with changes in the quantity and kind of contaminating impurities some or all of these properties change. The {{physical and}} chemical properties of the impurities, and not of the waxes as a whole, must therefore be used as the basis for classifying crude beeswaxes. The impurities in crude beeswax consist of honey, suspended particles, or dissolved substances, and {{may or may not be}} colored. The soluble colored materials are attributable to substances extracted from pollens, to propolis, and to substances produced by contact of the wax with metals. Darkening of crude wax by contact with iron or oxides of iron is very common. The crude waxes that were highly contaminated with propolis showed higher densities, indices of refraction, acid numbers, and iodine numbers than those containing little propolis but appreciable quantities of other soluble contaminants. Samples high in propolis could not be decolorized by sun bleaching or adsorption, and they were decolorized chemically only with difficulty. When melted crude waxes were treated with certain dilute acids, brown waxes became yellow, but the yellow color was not removed. In tests of the complete removal or destruction of colored impurities by action of sunlight, adsorbent solids, and chemicals, the individual waxes differed greatly depending on the nature of the colored impurity. This fact indicates the necessity for establishing the chemical structure of these colored constituents and also their specific {{physical and chemical}} properties. The effect of the method of decolorization on the composition of the wax is reflected to the greatest extent in the differences between the chemical properties of crude waxes and the corresponding refined waxes. The ash content was lowest in the waxes refined by sun bleaching. This process, however, was not so widely applicable to all waxes as the chemical method, which in every case produced a nearly white product with a relatively high ash content. Wax bloom has been shown to be a mixture of organic compounds of low final melting point and narrow melting range. Preliminary experiments on the absorption spectra of extracts of crude beeswaxes and of a pollen suggest the possibility of determining that the same colored substances may be common to some crude beeswaxes and pollens...|$|E

Based on Wenzel model and Cassie-Baxter model, the hydrophobic mechanism of these typical parts is analyzed briefly. Results present that the contact angles of water droplets on these typical parts change obviously, as exhibiting the greatest value of (132. 92 ± 4. 73) ° on internal wings and the smallest value of (119. 47 ± 4. 32) ° on external wings, whereas the neck surface and the mouthpart surface presenting rather similar contact angle values. SEM and SWLI observations show that the surface of external wings distributes ~ 100 μm scaled ridge-like convexes and nano <b>scaled</b> <b>wax</b> coverings, and the surface of internal wings consists of milli-micro scaled ridge-like convexes and numerous micro-nano scaled mastoids. Both the neck surface and mouthpart surface show undulate structures with milli-micro ranged parameters, whereas present rather smooth micromorphology when examining a rather small area. The surface of internal wings possesses the dual structures consisting of ridge-like convexes and numerous mastoids, thus it makes water droplet to generate the Cassie-Baxter contact state and consequently exhibit great contact angles. Other typical parts of the locust's body surface possess the microstructures to make water droplet to generate the Wenzel contact state and thereby exhibit relatively smaller contact angles.

40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{variability of}} grazing has potential consequences for intertidal productivity and community structure, particularly {{as many of}} the underlying functional relationships are thought to be non linear. As a first approximation, it can be hypothesised that grazing is patchy over short time periods before a more uniform coverage is established over longer time scales. This prediction is supported by relatively short term observations previously made of limpet foraging. We used eight arrays of wax disks on each of four shores to test the hypothesis that grazing is patchy in the short term, but that this pattern is lost as the pattern of grazing averages out over longer time <b>scales.</b> <b>Wax</b> disk arrays were exposed for two weeks at a time for a period of six weeks in 2001 and in 2002 using the same set of disk holes each time. Grazing at the same disk location could therefore be measured over two weeks and over longer periods by averaging successive deployments. We used all three successive deployments to estimate the average grazing at each disk location over a six week period in 2001 and 2002. All six deployments were used to characterise the pattern of grazing at longer time scales. The spatial pattern of grazing in arrays was summarized using semivariogram analyses. For two-week deployments, the average standardized semivariance of grazing for disks separated by 20 cm was less than one. This pattern implies spatial autocorrelation of grazing at this scale. There was no support for the hypothesis that small scale patchiness in grazing would disappear over time. The average strength of spatial autocorrelation increased when data were integrated over longer periods. A preliminary analysis indicated that the degree of autocorrelation within arrays increased with grazing intensity at short time scales. Surface roughness disrupted autocorrelation of grazing over both short and long time scales. The persistent patchiness of grazing is likely to have implications for biofilm productivity, particularly on smoother shores.

30|$|Formation damage {{could also}} result due to {{plugging}} of the formation. Asphalts, {{the formation of}} fines, inorganic <b>scales,</b> and <b>waxes</b> are {{the main source of}} plugging. The plugging problem has a major effect on rapid declining of natural depletion of a field. During the production operation, the precipitation of organic and inorganic materials may also result in a reduction in the production or plugging the well. Inorganic scales such as CaCO 3 and CaSO 4 are of the most common well-plugging conditions which occurs within the tubing string. Organic scale materials such as paraffin could also precipitate near the well or inside the wellbore. Adsorption and retention of viscoelastic surfactant (VES) were observed by several studies (Curbelo et al. 2007; Paria and Khilar 2004; Patzkó and Dékány 1993; ShamsiJazeyi et al. 2014). Viscoelastic surfactants are used in stimulation and EOR and could cause the formation damage. The adsorption and retention of VES and other surfactants from aqueous solution on the reservoir rock could result in reducing the permeability of the rock (Yu et al. 2011). Different polymer additives used in drilling, completion and EOR could also reduce the permeability due to plugging in pore throats of the rock (Audibert et al. 1999).|$|R

As global sea level is primarily {{determined by the}} volume of these ice sheets, {{there is a direct}} (yet complex) relation between global sea level and the northern hemispheric (NH) temperature. This relation is essentially represented by a model of the NH ice sheets. We use a thermomechanical ice-sheet–ice shelf–bedrock model in conjunction with an inverse method to deduce a time series of NH temperature (from 120 kyr BP until present) that is consistent with the observed global sea level record. The advantage of this method is that it provides the annual mean surface air temperature averaged over the NH continents north of 40 °N. The results reveal that ice age temperatures were 4 – 10 °C lower than today, which agrees with other temperature reconstructions. However, reconstructed temperatures are comparitively low during {{the early stages of the}} glacial, a feature that is consistent with the rapid growth of the ice sheets. The sensitivity of the results for uncertainties in precipitation rate, in observed sea level and in some other model parameters is examined to quantify the error in reconstructed temperature.

50|$|In {{response}} to extremes of temperature, plants can produce various proteins. These {{protect them from}} the damaging effects of ice formation and falling rates of enzyme catalysis at low temperatures, and from enzyme denaturation and increased photorespiration at high temperatures. As temperatures fall, production of antifreeze proteins and dehydrins increases. As temperatures rise, production of heat shock proteins increases. Metabolic imbalances associated with temperature extremes result in the build-up of reactive oxygen species, which can be countered by antioxidant systems. Cell membranes are also affected by changes in temperature and can cause the membrane to lose its fluid properties and become a gel in cold conditions or to become leaky in hot conditions. This can affect the movement of compounds across the membrane. To prevent these changes, plants can change the composition of their membranes. In cold conditions, more unsaturated fatty acids are placed in the membrane and in hot conditions more saturated fatty acids are inserted.Plants can avoid overheating by minimising the amount of sunlight absorbed and by enhancing the cooling effects of wind and transpiration. Plants can reduce light absorption using reflective leaf hairs, <b>scales,</b> and <b>waxes.</b> These features are so common in warm dry regions that these habitats can be seen to form a ‘silvery landscape’ as the light scatters off the canopies. Some species, such as Macroptilium purpureum, can move their leaves throughout the day so that they are always orientated to avoid the sun (paraheliotropism). Knowledge of these mechanisms has been key to breeding for heat stress tolerance in agricultural plants.|$|R

White wax, produced by the male second-instar larvae, is widely used in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and cosmetics industries. However, female E. pela cannot produce wax. In addition, females and males are dramatically distinct at each developmental stage. The males undergo holometabolous-like development, developing through egg, first- and second-stage nymph, pupal (prepupal and pupal), and adult stages and emerging as winged adults. The second-instar male nymphal period lasts 2  months, which is a relatively long period, whereas the male adult period lasts only 1  week because the males die immediately after mating (Chen 2011). In contrast, the females undergo neotenous development, developing through egg, first- and second-stage nymph, and adult stages. The female adult period is approximately 8  months and is the longest developmental stage in E. plea. E. pela is widely distributed from the subtropics to temperate areas in China, Korea, and Japan. Individuals can survive a high temperature of 44.0  °C and a low temperature of − 30.4  °C in these areas (Chen 2011).|$|R

Repeated applications of 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) were performed on ear and dorsal skin of BALB/c mice to induce AD-like symptoms and skin lesions. Oral administration of CWPS decreased serum IgE level and limited the infiltration of mast cells and eosinophils to the dermal tissues in the DNCB-induced AD mice. In addition, CWPS reduced Th 1 and Th 17 responses, leading to an attenuated cutaneous inflammatory response. Furthermore, in vitro study also demonstrated that CWPS limited T cell activation and cytokines (i. e. IFN-γ and IL- 17) production induced by DNCB.

For wax, the use of QCM for accurate measurements of the solubility of wax in synthetic binary and quaternary mixtures of n-alkanes is demonstrated and validated against literature data and model predictions. The use of the QCM for measurements of wax appearance temperature (WAT) and wax disappearance temperature (WDT) for stabilised and live reservoir fluids is presented. The development of QCM based equipment for investigating the effect of temperature gradient on wax deposition tendency at ambient and high pressure is described. The development and validation of the application of QCM technology for comparing and optimising dose rates for wax inhibitors at atmospheric and high pressure is presented. Wax case studies employing the developed equipment and methods are included. In the case of asphaltenes the potential use of QCM based equipment for measuring asphaltene onset in standard solvent titration measurements is shown. In addition by comparing step-wise and continuous injection results, potential errors in asphaltene stability measurements are highlighted. QCM tests with live fluids show that asphaltene onset can be readily detected in reservoir fluids at high pressure/high temperature conditions. In addition reversibility of asphaltene deposition can be demonstrated.

Formicidae {{were the most}} numerous group within the epigeal and the arboreal arthropods (2772 and 2269 ind., respectively). The weaver ant, Oecophylla smaragdina, was the most abundant species within the arboreal arthropods. Pheidole spp. was most frequent in pitfall traps. Spiders were the second most numerous group (524 and 619 ind., respectively). Lycosidae were predominant in pitfall traps and Salticidae in net catches with the beating method on the trees. In the barber traps, Carabidae and Staphylinidae were only present in low numbers (47 ind.). Coccinellidae were the most numerous family within the arboreal predatory beetles (89 ind.). Telsimia sp. accounted for 63 % of the ladybird beetles. Crickets were frequently collected in pitfall traps (187 ind.). A survey on the occurrence and importance of mango pests in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea A survey was conducted at four sites in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea to determine the abundance and importance of nine insect pests in mango. The pests, except fruit flies which were monitored by fallen fruits, were monitored three times during 2002 according to their occurrence within the mango season. Out of these pests, the white mango scale Aulacaspis tubercularis, (Homopt., Diaspididae), the mango leafminer Acrocerops spp. (Lep., Gracillariidae), the leafhoppers,Idioscopus clypealis and,I. niveosparsus (Homopt., Cicadellidae), the soft scales Saissetia sp. and Parasaissetia sp. (Homopt., Coccidae) and the fruit fly Bactrocera frauenfeldi (Dip., Tephritidae) proved to be serious pests. Appropriate control measures, in particular biological and cultural methods, are proposed. Infestation levels with fruit piercing moths Othreis fullonia, O. materna, Eudocima salaminia (Lep., Noctuidae), aphids Toxoptera odinae (Homopt., Aphididae), blossom feeders Cosmostola sp., Gymnoscelis sp., Nanaguna breviuscula (Lepidoptera) and planthoppers Colgaroides acuminata, Colgar sp., Scolypopa sp. (Homopt., Flatidae, Ricaniidae) were lower. Appropriate control measures are recommended but not immediately required. On the biological control of Ceroplastes rubens (Homopt., Coccidae) with the introduced parasitoid Anicetus beneficus (Hym., Encyrtidae) A {{study was conducted in}} three provinces of Papua New Guinea to determine damage by the pink <b>wax</b> <b>scale</b> Ceroplastes rubens and to identify endemic parasitoids and parasitization levels in order to evaluate the necessity and possibility of a classical biological control with an introduced parasitoid. Infestation levels with the pink <b>wax</b> <b>scale</b> variied 3. 82 % and 6. 40 %. The parasitization levels variied between 1. 19 % and 3. 05 %. Out of the nine endemic parasitoids identified, Aprostocetus sp. (Hym., Eulophidae) was the most frequent one. The pink <b>wax</b> <b>scale</b> parasitoid Anicetus beneficus (Hym., Encyrtidae) was imported from Australia and released at four sites in the Central Province in March/April 2002. The establishment was controlled at two sites six resp. twelve months after release. Parasitization levels increased significantly (from 3. 05 % to 5. 45 % at Laloki and from 2. 04 % to 22. 15 % at Tahira). At both sites, A. beneficus was the most frequent parasitoid. The parasitization process at the Laloki site was disturbed by the ant Tapinoma sp. Studies on the biology of Deanolis sublimbalis (Lep., Pyralidae) and its natural enemies A study was conducted at four sites in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea to determine infestation levels and biological behaviour of the red banded mango caterpillar Deanolis sublimbalis (RBMC). Eggs and larvae were collected to identify natural enemies and to develop potential control strategies. Infestation levels of mango fruits variied between 3. 36 % and 23. 18 %. The eggs are mainly found at the peduncle covered with dried sepals. Pupation takes place inside the bark of the mango tree. No other plants than Mangifera spp. were confirmed as hosts in laboratory and field studies. The pest goes into diapause during mango off-season. No egg or larval parasitoids were recorded. Control measures like sticky bands are an appropriate method to prevent pupation in the bark. A spraying scheme needs to be developed for commercial producers. It is further recommended to search for potential natural enemies in the centre of origin of M. indica...|$|R
