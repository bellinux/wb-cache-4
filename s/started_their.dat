5|$|England <b>started</b> <b>their</b> second innings with {{a deficit}} of 337 runs and reached 1/54 by the {{premature}} {{end of the second}} day due to bad light. The following morning, they made slow and steady progress as Johnston bowled his finger spin from around the wicket with a well-protected off side. The four men in the off side ring had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly. The English batsmen progressed and Johnston had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton, but there were few scares.|$|E
5|$|England then <b>started</b> <b>their</b> reply, and Lindwall {{took the}} new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball to Hutton.

However, Miller threw the ball back, indicating that his body {{would not be able}} to withstand it. This resulted in media consternation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
