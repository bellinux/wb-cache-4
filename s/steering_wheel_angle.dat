25|$|The {{brain of}} the ESC {{system is the}} {{electronic}} control unit (ECU). The various control techniques are embedded in it. Often, the same ECU is used for diverse systems {{at the same time}} (ABS, Traction control system, climate control, etc.). The input signals are sent through the input-circuit to the digital controller. The desired vehicle state is determined based upon the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>angle,</b> its gradient and the wheel speed. Simultaneously, the yaw sensor measures the actual state. The controller computes the needed brake or acceleration force for each wheel and directs via the driver circuits the valves of the hydraulic modulator. Via a Controller Area Network interface the ECU is connected with other systems (ABS, etc.) in order to avoid giving contradictory commands.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{electronic}} stability {{control systems}} are an {{evolution of the}} ABS concept. Here, {{a minimum of two}} additional sensors are added to help the system work: these are a <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>angle</b> sensor, and a gyroscopic sensor. The theory of operation is simple: when the gyroscopic sensor detects that the direction taken by the car does not coincide with what the steering wheel sensor reports, the ESC software will brake the necessary individual wheel(s) (up to three with the most sophisticated systems), so that the vehicle goes the way the driver intends. The steering wheel sensor also helps in the operation of Cornering Brake Control (CBC), since this will tell the ABS that wheels {{on the inside of the}} curve should brake more than wheels on the outside, and by how much.|$|E

Circuit board layouts and CAD files for 3 D printing are also provided online. The paper is mainly aimed at research institutions needing to collect this data in proving ground scenarios at a limited budged without requiring access to manufacturer's IP.

40|$|Abstract. This paper aims at {{improving}} {{the design of}} torque sensor used in the EPS system. Such design not only integrates the torque and the corner signal, but also saves space. By using Matlab interior point method, the gear system parameters are optimized andthe weight {{and the size of}} the sensor are reduced. Bench test results demonstrate that the measurement accuracy of this self-designed sensor is able to meet the demands of EPS. 1. Design of the torque and angle sensor gear set The structural design of sensor gear is shown in fig 1 [1]. We define gear 1 and gear 2 to have the same number of gear teeth; the duplex gears 3, 4, and 5 to have the same number of gear teeth; gear 6, 7 with the same amount of gear teeth. Gear 1, 6, 8 and double gear 3 hence become the main concerns in parameter design. The transmission ratio is respectively: Z 1 =Z 2 = 84 ；Z' 3 =Z’ 4 =Z’ 5 = 15 ；Z 3 =Z 4 =Z 5 = 45 ；Z 6 =Z 7 = 35 ；Z 8 = 36 (1) In Eqs. 1, Z’ 3 refers to the teeth number of the medium-small-sized duplex gear. Z 3 refers to the teeth number of the medium-large-sized duplex gear. Fig 1 Sensor gear arrangement To set the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> atthe initial position for angle 0 °, then the angle difference between pinion 6 and pinion 8 is 0 ° too. If the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel’s</b> rotation <b>angle</b> is, then the angle difference between gear 6 and gear 8 is, thus the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel’s</b> rotation <b>angle</b> corresponds with the angle difference of the pinions. Therefore, the measurement of the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel’s</b> rotation <b>angle</b> can be converted into the measurement of the angle difference between the two pinions. According to the transmission ratio, when the rotation angle is, the turning angle of gear 6 is and the turning angle of gear 8 is 3 7...|$|R
50|$|The car {{also uses}} Volvo's Intelligent Driver Information System (IDIS) which {{continuously}} monitors the car's preemptive {{systems such as}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>angle,</b> pedal depressions, and overall factors that help the vehicle's computer to decide if the driver is busy or distracted merging or turning, and will then accordingly delay certain data or alerts that are unimportant.|$|E
5000|$|EBD {{may work}} in {{conjunction}} with ABS and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) to minimize yaw accelerations during turns. ESC compares the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>angle</b> to vehicle turning rate using a yaw rate sensor. [...] "Yaw" [...] is the vehicle's rotation around its vertical center of gravity (turning left or right). If the yaw sensor detects more/less yaw than the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>angle</b> should create, the car is understeering or oversteering and ESC activates one of the front or rear brakes to rotate the car back onto its intended course. For example, if a car is making a left turn and begins to understeer (the car plows forward {{to the outside of}} the turn) ESC activates the left rear brake, which will help turn the car left. The sensors are so sensitive, and the actuation is so quick that the system may correct direction before the driver reacts. ABS helps prevent wheel lock-up and EBD helps apply appropriate brake force to make ESC work effectively and easily.|$|E
50|$|Standard {{terminology}} {{used to describe}} understeer and oversteer are defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in document J670 and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in document 8855. By these terms, understeer and oversteer are based on differences in steady-state conditions where the vehicle is following a constant-radius path at a constant speed with a constant <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>angle,</b> on a flat and level surface.|$|E
40|$|Fatigued {{driving is}} {{a major cause of}} road accidents. For this reason, the method in this paper is based on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>angles</b> (SWA) and yaw angles (YA) {{information}} under real driving conditions to detect drivers’ fatigue levels. It analyzes the operation features of SWA and YA under different fatigue statuses, then calculates the approximate entropy (ApEn) features of a short sliding window on time series. Using the nonlinear feature construction theory of dynamic time series, with the fatigue features as input, designs a “ 2 - 6 - 6 - 3 ” multi-level back propagation (BP) Neural Networks classifier to realize the fatigue detection. An approximately 15 -h experiment is carried out on a real road, and the data retrieved are segmented and labeled with three fatigue levels after expert evaluation, namely “awake”, “drowsy” and “very drowsy”. The average accuracy of 88. 02 % in fatigue identification was achieved in the experiment, endorsing the value of the proposed method for engineering applications...|$|R
