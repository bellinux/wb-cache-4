40|$|Objective: We {{examine whether}} trust in <b>smart</b> <b>systems</b> is {{generated}} analogously to trust in humans {{and whether the}} automation level of <b>smart</b> <b>systems</b> affects trustworthiness and acceptability of those systems. Background: Trust {{is an important factor}} when considering acceptability of automation technology. As shared goals lead to social trust, and intelligent machines tend to be treated like humans, the authors expected that shared driving goals would also lead to increased trustworthiness and acceptability of adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems. Method: In an experiment, participants (N = 57) were presented with descriptions of three ACCs with different automation levels that were described as systems that either shared their driving goals or did not. Trustworthiness and acceptability of all the ACCs were measured. Results: ACCs sharing the driving goals of the user were more trustworthy and acceptable than were ACCs not sharing the driving goals of the user. Furthermore, ACCs that took over driving tasks while providing information were more trustworthy and acceptable than were ACCs that took over driving tasks without providing information. Trustworthiness mediated the effects of both driving goals and automation level on acceptability of ACCs. Conclusion: As when trusting other humans, trusting <b>smart</b> <b>systems</b> depends on those systems sharing the user’s goals. Furthermore, based on their description, <b>smart</b> <b>systems</b> that take over tasks are judged more trustworthy and acceptable when they also provide information. Application: For optimal acceptability of <b>smart</b> <b>systems,</b> goals of the user should be shared by the <b>smart</b> <b>systems,</b> and <b>smart</b> <b>systems</b> should provide information to their user...|$|R
