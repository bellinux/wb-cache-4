40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{examines}} the effect of mean <b>stress</b> on <b>the</b> fatigue behaviour of very hard (Rockwell C 60) steels (AISI 8822, 8620, 9310, and cold-worked pre-stressing wire). In <b>the</b> mean <b>stress</b> tests, <b>the</b> minimum <b>stress</b> in <b>the</b> fatigue cycle was varied from test to test over a range from - 1200 MPa to a value approaching <b>the</b> true fracture <b>stress</b> of each material. The results are not adequately explained by current theories for the effect of mean stress on fatigue behaviour {{in the region of}} compressive mean stresses. All current theories suggest that <b>the</b> maximum <b>stress</b> at <b>the</b> fatigue limit decreases with decreasing minimum <b>stress.</b> <b>The</b> results of this study shows that instead of continuing to decrease with decreasing minimum <b>stress</b> <b>the</b> maximum <b>stress</b> at <b>the</b> fatigue limit remains constant indicating an insensitivity to <b>the</b> minimum <b>stress</b> in <b>the</b> fatigue cycle for minimum <b>stresses</b> below <b>the</b> value in a fully reversed fatigue test.
