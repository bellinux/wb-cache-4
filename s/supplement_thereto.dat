40|$|Waste {{management}} {{and providing a}} world population with rich in protein food are two important problems of which the utilization of agro-industrial (agriculture and food industry) waste by higher mushrooms causes the growing interest of researchers around the world. More than 150 individual types of wastes have been investigated last decade as alternative substrates alone or in various compositions (more than 450 substrates) for cultivation of 52 higher mushroom species (about 100 strains) {{as evidenced by the}} results of more than 130 considered in the review scientific publications. All waste is used as a basis for substrates and <b>supplements</b> <b>thereto,</b> are characteristic of the respective continent and region of the world. Publications containing biochemical studies of substrates and fungi confirm that fungi are grown in rich in biologically active substances unconventional substrates, provide a rich biochemical composition of fungi compared with conventional substrates (sawdust, straw, etc.). The disadvantage of many publications is the lack of mention of examined fungi strains, whereas studies of various strains of the same fungus in the same substrate show different results. The prospect of the study of agricultural residues utilization by higher mushrooms consists in the investigations of: productivity, biological efficiency of the process, morphological and biochemical indices of cultivated mushrooms, depending on the biochemical parameters of substrates and the process conditions; safety of cultivated mushrooms...|$|R

The water rates specified in this tariff (except for measured water) were graduated in a table according to the width and number of stories of the houses, and were made payable annually in advance on 1 May in each year, with a penalty of three percent if not paid by the 1 July and interest at the rate of seven percent from the 20th of December. The regulations extend to many details, making provision for extra charges to certain kinds of establishments, providing penalties for misuse of the water, etc. The city authorities answered the bill, admitting that they had assessed upon the mortgaged premises the water rents set forth in the bill, and alleged that they were imposed in pursuance of an act of the Legislature of New Jersey entitled [...] "An act to authorize the construction of works for the supplying of Jersey City and places adjacent with pure and wholesome water," [...] approved March 25, 1852, and an act entitled [...] "An act to reorganize the local government of Jersey City," [...] passed March 31, 1871, and the <b>supplements</b> <b>thereto,</b> and insisted that said water rents were a lien prior to the mortgages, and prayed that it might be so adjudged.|$|R

40|$|Although it {{cannot be}} stated as {{fact that the}} digital library is the next Sigmoid Curve of libraries, it will be folly for librarians not to {{consider}} this likely possibility very seriously {{and to ensure that}} they are prepared should it happen. The wise librarian must see to it that he has young up coming and dynamic leaders in his organization, prepared to ride the next wave so that the library may benefit. What is clear at this stage (1996), is that even if books and the traditional formats are not replaced by computer media, computer media, at the very least, will be a very important permanent <b>supplement</b> <b>thereto.</b> This point of view is {{based on the fact that}} the important thing about media is that they should be appropriate. Appropriateness is not an absolute concept, but it can be defined in terms of suitability for a purpose. With the huge gap in the sophistication of technology between the First and Third World, it stands to reason that the digital medium is not an appropriate one for the latter. The world as a whole, however, changes more spontaneously, and never so erratically, as during a period of dramatic technological change. These words caution us to expect even more (dramatic) change in the information profession. An open mind should be kept regarding problems and opportunities this offer our profession. N...|$|E
