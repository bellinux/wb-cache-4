25|$|Other common <b>spasmolytic</b> agents include: methocarbamol, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, gabapentin, metaxalone, and orphenadrine.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{enhancement}} of inhibition in the CNS, most <b>spasmolytic</b> agents have {{the side effects of}} sedation, drowsiness and may cause dependence with long-term use. Several of these agents also have abuse potential, and their prescription is strictly controlled.|$|E
25|$|The {{generation}} of the neuronal signals in motor neurons that cause muscle contractions are dependent on the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition the motor neuron receives. <b>Spasmolytic</b> agents generally work by either enhancing the level of inhibition, or reducing the level of excitation. Inhibition is enhanced by mimicking or enhancing the actions of endogenous inhibitory substances, such as GABA.|$|E

2500|$|A {{muscle relaxant}} {{is a drug}} that affects {{skeletal}} muscle function and decreases the muscle tone. It {{may be used to}} alleviate symptoms such as muscle spasms, pain, and hyperreflexia. The term [...] "muscle relaxant" [...] is used to refer to two major therapeutic groups: neuromuscular blockers and <b>spasmolytics.</b> Neuromuscular blockers act by interfering with transmission at the neuromuscular end plate and have no central nervous system (CNS) activity. They are often used during surgical procedures and in intensive care and emergency medicine to cause temporary paralysis. <b>Spasmolytics,</b> also known as [...] "centrally acting" [...] muscle relaxants, are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions. While both neuromuscular blockers and <b>spasmolytics</b> are often grouped together as muscle relaxants, the term is commonly used to refer to <b>spasmolytics</b> only.|$|R

25|$|Clonidine {{and other}} {{imidazoline}} compounds {{have also been}} shown to reduce muscle spasms by their central nervous system activity. Tizanidine is perhaps the most thoroughly studied clonidine analog, and is an agonist at α2-adrenergic receptors, but reduces spasticity at doses that result in significantly less hypotension than clonidine. Neurophysiologic studies show that it depresses excitatory feedback from muscles that would normally increase muscle tone, therefore minimizing spasticity. Furthermore, several clinical trials indicate that tizanidine has a similar efficacy to other <b>spasmolytic</b> agents, such as diazepam and baclofen, with a different spectrum of adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydantoin}} derivative dantrolene is a <b>spasmolytic</b> {{agent with}} a unique mechanism of action outside of the CNS. It reduces skeletal muscle strength by inhibiting the excitation-contraction coupling in the muscle fiber. In normal muscle contraction, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the ryanodine receptor channel, which causes the tension-generating interaction of actin and myosin. Dantrolene interferes {{with the release of}} calcium by binding to the ryanodine receptor and blocking the endogenous ligand ryanodine by competitive inhibition. Muscle that contracts more rapidly is more sensitive to dantrolene than muscle that contracts slowly, although cardiac muscle and smooth muscle are depressed only slightly, most likely because the release of calcium by their sarcoplasmic reticulum involves a slightly different process. Major adverse effects of dantrolene include general muscle weakness, sedation, and occasionally hepatitis.|$|E
25|$|Gas colic, {{also known}} as tympanic colic, {{is the result of}} gas buildup within the horse's {{digestive}} tract due to excessive fermentation within the intestines or a decreased ability to move gas through it. It is usually the result of a change in diet, but can also occur due to low dietary roughage levels, parasites (22% of spasmodic colics are associated with tapeworms), and anthelminthic administration. This gas buildup causes distention and increases pressure in the intestines, causing pain. Additionally, it usually causes an increase in peristaltic waves, which can lead to painful spasms of the intestine, producing subsequent spasmodic colic. The clinical signs of these forms of colic are generally mild, transient, and respond well to <b>spasmolytic</b> medications, such as buscopan, and analgesics. Gas colics usually self-correct, but there is the risk of subsequent torsion (volvulus) or displacement of the bowel due to gas distention, which causes this affected piece of bowel to rise upward in the abdomen.|$|E

2500|$|Choking horses {{should be}} {{deprived}} of food and drink pending veterinary attention, {{so as not to}} increase the obstructive load within the esophagus. [...] The veterinarian will often sedate the horse and administer <b>spasmolytics,</b> such as butylscopolamine, to help the esophagus to relax. Once the muscles of the esophagus no longer force the food down the throat (active peristalsis), it may slip down on its own accord. If <b>spasmolytics</b> do not solve the problem, the veterinarian will usually pass a stomach tube through one of the nostrils and direct it into the esophagus until the material is reached, at which point gentle pressure is applied to manually push the material down. Gentle warm water lavage (water sent through the stomach tube, to soften the food material) may be required to help the obstructing matter pass more easily, but caution should be exercised to prevent further aspiration of fluid into the trachea.|$|R

30|$|A {{second reason}} {{could be the}} lack of bowel {{relaxation}} at hospital B. According to the second ESGAR consensus statement on CTC [6], use of <b>spasmolytics</b> is preferable prior to colonic distension. A third reason may be the use of 2  l polyethylene glycol at both hospitals, which could result in residual fluid in the colon [30]. The use of sodium phosphate in a single dose would probably {{have resulted in a}} smaller amount of residual fluid. Another reason could be the use of different tagging material at the two hospitals (100  ml Gastrografin at hospital A and 20  ml Iomeron at hospital B). In two large studies [1, 7] showing good results, Gastrografin was used as tagging material.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{show the}} {{benefits}} of a continuous intrathecal baclofen (ITB) test infusion in a patient with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), with an improved gait performance after ITB pump implantation. Design: Case report. Setting: University hospital. Participant: A 49 -year old man with HSP experiencing progressive walking difficulties because of lower extremity spasticity, which did not respond to oral <b>spasmolytics.</b> Interventions: A prolonged, continuous ITB test infusion was started at a low dose and increased gradually, to provide a stable dose of ITB over a prolonged period. The gradual dose increase provided the patient enough time to experience the effects of ITB, because he feared that ITB therapy might cause functional loss. Main Outcome Measures: Modified Ashworth Scale, electromyography, muscle strength, timed Up and Go tests, and the Patient Global Impression of Change. Gait performance before and after ITB pump implantation was assessed in a motion laboratory. Results: During the test infusion, the ITB dose was gradually increased to a continuous dose of 1081 mu g/d. This dose caused the spasticity to decrease, with maintenance of muscle strength. After pump implantation, gait performance was improved, resulting in increased knee flexion during the loading response and a doubled walking speed as compared with baseline. Conclusions: Patients with HSP who have mild spasticity that does not respond to oral <b>spasmolytics</b> should receive a continuous ITB test infusion, to provide them with enough time to experience the delicate balance between spasmolysis and muscle strength. ITB administration is a suitable therapy to improve gait performance in patients with HSP. (C) 2015 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicin...|$|R
30|$|Early in our series, {{we did not}} {{routinely}} re-attempt {{the procedure}} in cases of failed cannulation due {{to the cost of}} the device. However, we have since successfully repeated the procedure in two out of five cases. This reflects the experience from other units where successful second attempts are possible in 50 % of patients. Presumably the initial failure in these women is due to temporary tubal spasm. Such spasm may be reduced by the usage of warmed irrigation fluid and we have recently started using a warming cabinet. The use of antispasmodics has not been shown to reduce the incidence of tubal spasm. However, in a recent study from Singapore a significant increase in placement rates and decreased mean operation time were seen when patients were pre-medicated with <b>spasmolytics</b> (hyoscine) [11].|$|R
25|$|<b>Spasmolytics</b> such as carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, and {{methocarbamol}} {{are commonly}} prescribed for {{low back pain}} or neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches and myofascial pain syndrome. However, they are not recommended as first-line agents; in acute low back pain, they are not more effective than paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and in fibromyalgia they are not more effective than antidepressants. Nevertheless, some (low-quality) evidence suggests muscle relaxants can add benefit to treatment with NSAIDs. In general, no high-quality evidence supports their use. No drug {{has been shown to}} be better than another, and all of them have adverse effects, particularly dizziness and drowsiness. Concerns about possible abuse and interaction with other drugs, especially if increased sedation is a risk, further limit their use.

50|$|Symptomatic {{treatment}} of visceral pain relies primarily upon pharmacotherapy. Since visceral pain can result secondary {{to a wide}} variety of causes, with or without associated pathology, a wide variety of pharmacological classes of drugs are used including a variety of analgesics (ex. opiates, NSAIDs, benzodiazepines), antispasmodics (ex. loperamide), antidepressants (ex. TCA, SSRI, SNRI) as well as others (ex. ketamine, clonidine, gabapentin). In addition, pharmacotherapy that targets the underlying cause of the pain can help alleviate symptoms due to lessening visceral nociceptive inputs. For example, the use of nitrates can reduce anginal pain by dilating the coronary arteries and thus reducing the ischemia causing the pain. The use of <b>spasmolytics</b> (antispasmodics) can help alleviate pain from a gastrointestinal obstruction by inhibiting the contraction of the gut. There are issues associated with pharmacotherapy that include side effects (ex. constipation associated with opiate use), chemical dependence or addiction, and inadequate pain relief.|$|R
