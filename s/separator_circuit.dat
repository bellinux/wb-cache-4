40|$|The {{combined}} use {{of brush}} anodes and glass fiber (GF 1) separators, and plastic mesh supporters were used {{here for the}} first time to create a scalable microbial fuel cell architecture. <b>Separators</b> prevented short <b>circuiting</b> of closely-spaced electrodes, and cathode supporters were used to avoid water gaps between the separator and cathode that can reduce power production. The maximum power density with a separator and supporter and a single cathode was 75 ± 1 W/m 3. Removing the separator decreased power by 8 %. Adding a second cathode increased power to 154 ± 1 W/m 3. Current was increased by connecting two MFCs connected in parallel. These results show that brush anodes, combined with a glass fiber separator and a plastic mesh supporter, produce a useful MFC architecture that is inherently scalable due to good insulation between the electrodes and a compact architecture. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{phenomena}} {{related to}} water condensation behavior inside a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), and analyzes {{the effects of}} liquid water and gas flow {{on the performance of}} the fuel cell. A method for simultaneous measurements of the local current density across the reaction area and direct observation of the phenomena in the cell are developed. Experimental results comparing separator types indicate the effect of shortcut flow in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) under the land areas of serpentine separators, and also show the potential of straight channel separators to achieve a relatively-uniform current density distribution. To evaluate shortcut flows under the land areas of serpentine <b>separators,</b> a simple <b>circuit</b> model of the gas flow is presented. The analysis shows that slight variations in oxygen concentration caused by the shortcut flows under the land areas affect the local and overall current density distributions. It is also shown that the establishment of gas paths under the water in channels filled with condensed water is effective for stable operation at low flow rates of air in the straight channels...|$|R
40|$|Lithium {{dendrites}} are needle-like {{structures that}} form during the electrodeposition of lithium metal. These whiskers complicate {{the use of}} lithium metal as an anode in lithium batteries because they can puncture the <b>separator</b> and short <b>circuit</b> the battery. In addition, the large surface area and poor adhesion of the deposit contributes to loss of coulombic efficiency. The effect of alkali and alkaline earth metal ions on the morphology of electrodeposited lithium metal has been studied. Varying concentrations of alkali and alkaline earth metal ions were added to a 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) trimethylbutylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (N 1114 -TFSI) electrolyte. Lithium metal was electrodeposited from each electrolyte and examined ex-situ by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Alkali metal ions, {{with the exception of}} sodium, had little or no effect on the deposited lithium morphology. However, alkaline earth metal ions at 0. 05 M concentration significantly reduced the occurrence of dendrites. When the concentration of the alkaline earth metal ions was increased to 0. 1 M, dendrites were completely eliminated and lithium was deposited in a sphere-like morphology. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) showed that no alkaline earth metals were found in the sphere-like deposits, suggesting that dendrite mitigation occurred through an adsorption mechanism. © The Author(s) 2014.

40|$|Since their commercialization in 1990, the {{electrodes}} of the lithium-ion battery have remained fundamentally the same. While energy density improvements {{have come from}} reducing the cell packaging, higher capacity electrodes are needed to continue this trend. A lithium metal anode, where the negative electrode half reaction is the plating and stripping of metallic lithium, is explored {{as an alternative to}} current graphite anodes. The specific capacity of the lithium metal anode is over ten times that of the graphite anode, making it a serious candidate to further improve the energy density of lithium batteries. Electrodeposited lithium metal forms dendrites, sharp needles that can grow across the <b>separator</b> and short <b>circuit</b> the battery. Thus, a chief goal is to alter lithium’s plating morphology. This was achieved in two separate ionic liquid electrolytes by co-depositing lithium with sodium. The co-deposited sodium is thought to block dendritic sites, leading to a granular deposit. A nucleation study confirmed that metal deposits from the ionic liquid electrolyte containing sodium, prevented dendritic growth from nucleation on, and not after dendrites had already grown. A model based on the geometry of the nuclei was used to gain insight into the effect of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) that forms on freshly deposited lithium metal. In addition to sodium, the effect of alkaline earth metals on the lithium deposit morphology was also explored. While these metals did not deposit from the ionic liquid electrolyte, their addition also resulted in granular, dendrite free, deposits. The alkaline earth additives generally increased the overpotential for nucleating on the substrate and lowered the current density achievable. Strontium and barium showed the least of these negative effects while still providing a dendrite free deposit. A second hurdle for lithium metal anodes is the instability between the electrolyte and lithium metal. A protective SEI layer that prevents undesired side reactions is difficult to form because of the large volume change associated with cycling. Formation of a better SEI on lithium metal was attempted through the addition vinylene carbonate, which greatly improved the coulombic efficiency of lithium metal plating and stripping. The effect of gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, on the SEI layer was also investigated. It was found that the presence of nitrogen and oxygen improved the coulombic efficiency by facilitating a thinner SEI layer. This work presents attempts at improving the lithium metal anode both by increasing the coulombic efficiency of the redox process and by eliminating dendrite growth. The coulombic efficiency was improved through the bubbling of gases and addition of organic additives but work remains to increase this value further. Dendritic growth, which poses a safety hazard, was completely eliminated by two methods: 1) co-deposition and 2) adsorption of a foreign metal. Both methods could potentially be applied to different electrolytes, making them promising methods for preventing dendritic growth in future lithium metal anodes. Ph. D...|$|R
