40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{operation}} of a novel power converter for the switched reluctance generator. The sparse PWM converters reduce switch count and eliminate the front-end current <b>smoothing</b> <b>inductor</b> {{which leads to a}} low cost and small converter. The performance of the converter is investigated and simulation results are presente...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new DC/AC power {{converter}} topology that is obtained by merging a buck type DC/DC converter and a DC/AC three-phase PWM Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) {{without the need}} of the passive components (<b>smoothing</b> <b>inductor</b> and capacitance) between the two stages. The novel topology is characterized by less hard switchings needed to synthesize the desired output voltage states, mostly because the average voltage seen by the VSI is modulated {{in such a way}} that enables the elimination of its zero voltage state and allows for some zero voltage switchings, reducing the switching losses, that makes this topology more suitable for higher frequency operation, which would ultimately reduce the size of the converter in applications where a load side output filter needs to be fitted...|$|E
30|$|The {{operational}} behaviour of the STATCOM {{is superior}} {{to that of the}} SVC. Being based on a VSC, the STATCOM may be seen as a variable and controlled voltage source, as opposed to a variable shunt susceptance [10]. Basically, it behaves like a fast synchronous condenser without moving parts [1, 5]. Therefore the STATCOM does not use bulky inductors and banks of capacitors to absorb and to generate reactive power, respectively [1, 3]. The generation/absorption process is carried out by the action of the VSC voltage control according to (2) to yield either leading or lagging VAR operation to satisfy operational requirements [1]. Note that the current injected by the STATCOM has to be orthogonal to the bus voltage considering a lossless approach because no active power exchange is allowed due to the isolated DC bus of the VSC. The <b>smoothing</b> <b>inductor</b> is used between the VSC and the step-up transformer to eliminate the high-order harmonics. The DC capacitor is used to support and stabilize the DC voltage [1].|$|E
40|$|In this work, a Model Based Adaptive Direct Power Control (MB-ADPC) with {{constant}} switching frequency for Three-Phase Three-Level Neutral Point Clamped (3 L-NPC) converters is proposed. The rectifier and inverter operation mode {{are used to}} illustrate {{the flexibility of the}} proposed MB-ADPC controller. The control design process is based on the continuous averaged model of the system. Depending on the operation mode different control objectives have to be guaranteed. The proposed controller ensures the voltage regulation of the dc-link capacitors for the rectifier operation mode and to achieve voltage balance in the dc-link capacitors and the active and reactive power tracking for the rectifier and inverter operation modes. In addition, adaptive techniques are used to avoid system parameters uncertainties as <b>smoothing</b> <b>inductors</b> and grid frequency values. This work shows that the application of advanced control strategies based on the system model allows enhancing the performance of the overall system. The details of the controllers design process and the experimental results using a 50 kVA Three-Phase Three-Level NPC prototype are presented in this paper validating the proposed controllers...|$|R
2500|$|Modern {{electrification}} systems take AC {{energy from}} a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and {{converted to a}} DC voltage {{to be used by}} traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. Where should this conversion take place and at what voltage and current (AC or DC) should the power flow to the locomotive? [...] And how does all this relate to energy-efficiency? [...] Both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and <b>smoothing</b> reactors (<b>inductors).</b> [...] Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. [...] Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for.|$|R
5000|$|In 1973 (per {{the table}} below), DC {{traction}} at 3,000 volts, lost about 3 {{times as much}} energy (percentage-wise) in the catenary as AC at 25,000 volts. Paradoxically, {{it turned out that}} DC locomotives were somewhat more efficient overall than AC locomotives. [...] "Auxiliary Electric Motors" [...] are mainly used for air cooling electric machinery such as traction motors. Electric locomotives concentrate high power electric machinery in a relatively small space and thus require a lot of cooling. [...] Per the table below, a sizeable amount of energy (11-17%) is used for this, but when operating at nominal power only 2-4% is used. [...] The fact that the cooling motors run at full speed (and power) all the time makes their power consumption constant, so when the locomotive motors are operating at low power (far below the nominal regime) the percent of this power used for cooling blowers becomes much higher. The result is that under actual operating conditions, the percent energy used for cooling is a few times higher than [...] "nominal". Per the table below, AC locomotives used about 50% more energy for this purpose since in addition to cooling the motors, the blowers must cool the transformer, rectifiers and the <b>smoothing</b> reactor (<b>inductors),</b> which are mostly absent on DC locomotives. [...] The 3-phase AC power for these blower motors is supplied from a rotary phase converter which converts single phase (from the catenary via the main transformer) to 3-phase (and this also takes energy). It's proposed to reduce blower speeds when less cooling is needed.|$|R
