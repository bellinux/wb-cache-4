5|$|As Feodora grew older, various suitors were {{considered}} for marriage. The exiled Prince Peter Karađorđević, thirty-six years her senior, unsuccessfully requested {{her hand in}} marriage. Another potential candidate was her cousin Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In late 1897, Feodora became engaged to Prince Henry XXX of Reuss, and they married the following year, on 24 September 1898 in a Lutheran ceremony at Breslau. The groom was fifteen years older than his bride and a captain in a Brunswick regiment, but not wealthy or particularly high-ranked. Many in the family were shocked at the marriage, but the Dowager Empress was at least pleased that her granddaughter <b>seemed</b> <b>happy</b> with the match.|$|E
5|$|In 1593 {{he married}} Catherine Leigh, {{daughter}} of Sir Thomas Leigh of Stoneleigh Abbey in Warwickshire. Catherine {{came from a}} wealthy Protestant family and brought with her a dowry of £2,000, but also a religious association that offered Robert some respite from the recusancy laws then in effect. From {{the death of his}} grandmother the following year he inherited a property at Chastleton, in Oxfordshire. The couple's first son William died in infancy, but their second son Robert survived, and was baptised at Chastleton's Protestant church on 11November 1595. When Catesby's father died in 1598, his estates at Ashby St Ledgers were left to his wife, while Catesby and his family remained at Chastleton. Catesby had <b>seemed</b> <b>happy</b> to remain a Church Papist but after his wife's death later that year he became radicalised, and reverted to a more fanatical Catholicism.|$|E

25|$|It {{seemed that}} no one in the Channel Nine box could make a comment about him that wasn't negative. His feet, hands, {{technique}} and temperament were questioned. His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. It just seemed kind of mean. Especially when at the back of the press box some <b>seemed</b> <b>happy</b> when he was out. But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. He came into the captaincy without playing a game. He came into the Test team because of one-day runs. He was everything old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, he was pretty much everything he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E
25|$|In January 1962 the {{national}} Graham Kennedy's Channel 9 Show was cancelled {{and replaced by}} The Channel 9 Show hosted by Bert Newton. Kennedy continued to fine-tune his IMT performances. Kennedy had a strong understanding of key technical elements of television and perfected his comic timing, and watched the lenses on the TV cameras, adjusting his performance depending on whether {{he was in a}} wide shot or a close up. Compilation highlight programs of IMT segments were screened in Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide in May 1963 under the title The Best of Kennedy. The Best of Kennedy continued until December 1963. On IMT, Noel Ferrier was appointed the new Friday night host. Also in 1963 writer Mike McColl-Jones joined. Kennedy had often disliked having writers on the program, was reluctant for them to be publicly acknowledged, and often ignored all their material. In the case of McColl-Jones, Kennedy seemed to like him and his comedy material, which was apparently the key requirement by which Kennedy would use a writer's material. McColl-Jones continued as a writer on the series for several years. Also in 1963 Ernie Carroll joined the writing team. Kennedy had apparently relaxed his attitude towards writers by this stage and <b>seemed</b> <b>happy</b> to use their material with few complaints.|$|E
25|$|The {{refugees}} {{were transferred to}} the cruise ship Neuralia, which had been taken into war service. The Czechs looked to smuggle Ant between the two ships by hiding him in a kit bag. This failed as the dog pushed {{his head out of}} the bag just as they were boarding – fortunately for Ant the new crew <b>seemed</b> <b>happy</b> to have a dog on-board and welcomed him. The facilities on Neuralia were much better than Northmoor, as the cabins remained fitted out as a cruise ship and Ant could stay in the cabin with the men. The remainder of the voyage went smoothly, until Bozděch was informed about the quarantine rules for dogs upon entering the United Kingdom. Having no money with which to pay for the quarantine fees, the Czechs sought once again to smuggle him – this time into the UK. They elected to hide Ant once again in a bag, this time mixed up in those being transferred as cargo by crane. They arrived at the docks in Liverpool on 12 July, where they successfully took Ant ashore. They were nearly found out by a pair of military police as they were at the train station nearby as {{they were on their way}} to Cholmondeley, Cheshire.|$|E

McNish was called upon by Shackleton to make the James Caird seaworthy for the long voyage and was selected as part of the crew, possibly because Shackleton was afraid of the effect he would have on morale if left behind with the other men.

500|$|With the 1896 {{campaign}} over, {{a reporter}} asked Davenport in February 1897 who would replace Hanna {{as a special}} subject of his cartoons, and Davenport replied, [...] "Hanna {{is by no means}} out of the way. [...] He will probably continue a good subject for some time." [...] Hanna, having declined the position of Postmaster General, secured appointment to the Senate when McKinley made Ohio's aging senior senator, John Sherman, his Secretary of State. Until 1913, state legislatures, not the people, elected senators, and so Hanna had to seek election to a full term when the Ohio General Assembly met in January 1898. [...] Hanna campaigned in the 1897 legislative election, and was elected to the Senate in his own right the following January, in a very close vote. Davenport drew cartoons against Hanna in the senatorial race. [...] Nevertheless, when he attended the legislature's meeting in Columbus, he wore a Hanna button, and <b>seemed</b> <b>happy</b> after Hanna's triumph. [...] When asked why, he replied, [...] "that insures me six more years at him, and he's a good subject".|$|E

500|$|On 7 August 1999, Kouao visited Ealing social {{services}}; {{they said}} it was a housing issue and that the case was closed. Ealing social services would later be described as 'chaotic'. As a follow-up measure, a staff member at the hospital contacted a health visitor, but the health visitor said in the inquiry that she did not receive any contact. On 13 August 1999, Rossiter wrote to Petra Kitchman of Brent council, asking her to follow up on the Climbié case. Kitchman said in the inquiry that she contacted Arthurworrey, but Arthurworrey denied this. Later, on 2 September 1999, Rossiter sent a second letter. Kitchman said she spoke to Arthurworrey about this, but Arthurworrey denied this again. Arthurworrey made a visit to Climbié's home on 16 August 1999 and another one when Manning began forcing Climbié to sleep in the bathtub. Arthurworrey said in the inquiry that she {{was under the impression that}} Climbié <b>seemed</b> <b>happy,</b> but Garnham criticised Arthurworrey for not detecting any of the abuse, although Manning had described this visit as a [...] "put up job". Arthurworrey and Climbié had met on four occasions, where they were together for a total of less than 30 minutes, barely speaking to each other.|$|E
500|$|A key storyline for Keibler's {{on-screen}} character {{occurred when}} she left SmackDown! for Raw. Keibler made her official Raw debut on August 12, 2002. For the remainder of 2002 and most of 2003, Keibler was paired with her real-life boyfriend at the time, Test. As Test's on-screen marketing agent, {{she came up with}} the idea that Test should call his fans [...] "Testicles," [...] cut his hair, and reshape his image. The couple were originally villains but due to popularity of the gimmick, they became fan favorites. In the spring of 2003, Test, however, became to verbally abuse Keibler, who also started managing Scott Steiner. After months of build-up, Keibler finally left Test for Steiner on the June 2 edition of Raw. Steiner defeated Test for Keibler's services at Bad Blood, and Keibler <b>seemed</b> <b>happy</b> as Steiner's new manager, as the two alluded to having more than a professional relationship. Test, however, continued to harass Keibler and Steiner until Steiner accepted a rematch with Stacy's services on the line. On the August 18 episode of Raw, Test won the match after faking a leg injury and then blindsiding Steiner with a big boot. A match was then set for Unforgiven with the stipulation that if Test won, he would not only retain Keibler's services, but would acquire Steiner's services as well. During the match, Keibler's interference backfired, and Test won the match. Steiner then turned heel by attacking Keibler after her interference in his match on the September 29 episode of Raw backfired. For a time, Test and Steiner worked as a tag team, sharing the services of Keibler as their on-screen sex slave. The storyline finally ended on the December 1 episode of Raw, when general manager Mick Foley freed Keibler from her obligatory contracts with Test and Steiner by temporarily firing them.|$|E

Despite a 31-year age gap, the marriage <b>seemed</b> <b>happy,</b> according to John Aubrey, and lasted more than 12 years until Milton's death. (A plaque on the wall of Mynshull's House in Manchester describes Elizabeth as Milton's [...] "3rd and Best wife".) Samuel Johnson, however, claims that Mynshull was [...] "a domestic companion and attendant" [...] and that Milton's nephew Edward Phillips relates that Mynshull [...] "oppressed his children in his lifetime, and cheated them at his death".|$|E
