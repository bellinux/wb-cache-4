500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1952, Hepburn {{appeared}} in London's West End for a ten-week run of George Bernard Shaw's The Millionairess. Her parents had read Shaw {{to her when she}} was a child, which made the play a <b>special</b> <b>experience</b> for the actress. Two years of intense work had left her exhausted, however, and her friend Constance Collier wrote that Hepburn was [...] "on the verge of a nervous breakdown". Widely acclaimed, The Millionairess was brought to Broadway. In October 1952 it opened at the Shubert Theatre, where despite a lukewarm critical response it sold out its ten-week run. Hepburn subsequently tried to get the play adapted into a film: a script was written by Preston Sturges, and she offered to work for nothing and pay the director herself, but no studio picked up the project. She later referred to this as the biggest disappointment of her career.|$|E

6000|$|The {{course of}} action need not be explained. It has {{suggested}} itself more {{as a matter of}} feeling than a matter of thinking. It is the result not of a <b>special</b> <b>experience</b> but of general knowledge, fortified by earnest meditation. My greatest anxiety was in being able to strike and sustain the note of scrupulous fairness. The obligation of absolute fairness was imposed on me historically and hereditarily, by the peculiar experience of race and family, and, in addition, by my primary conviction that truth alone is the justification of any fiction which can make the least claim to the quality of art or may hope to take its place in the culture of men and women of its time. I had never been called before to a greater effort of detachment: detachment from all passions, prejudices and even from personal memories. [...] "Under Western Eyes" [...] on its first appearance in England was a failure with the public, perhaps because of that very detachment. I obtained my reward some six years later when I first heard that the book had found universal recognition in Russia and had been re-published there in many editions.|$|E
6000|$|... § 3. The principle, however, {{on which}} the {{reasoning}} proceeds, is sufficiently evident. It is the obvious one that when the cases which exist are shared among several kinds, it is impossible that each of those kinds should be {{a majority of the}} whole: on the contrary, there must be a majority against each kind, except one at most; and if any kind has more than its share in proportion to the total number, the others collectively must have less. Granting this axiom, and assuming that we have no ground for selecting any one kind as more likely than the rest to surpass the average proportion, it follows that we can not rationally presume this of any, which we should do if we were to bet in favor of it, receiving less odds than in the ratio of the number of the other kinds. Even, therefore, in this extreme case of the calculation of probabilities, which does not rest on <b>special</b> <b>experience</b> at all, the logical ground of the process is our knowledge—such knowledge as we then have—of the laws governing the frequency of occurrence of the different cases; but in this case the knowledge is limited to that which, being universal and axiomatic, does not require reference to specific experience, or to any considerations arising out of the special nature of the problem under discussion.|$|E

60|$|The various figures {{playing their}} part in the story also owe their {{existence}} to no <b>special</b> <b>experience</b> but to the general knowledge of the condition of Russia and of the moral and emotional reactions of the Russian temperament to the pressure of tyrannical lawlessness, which, in general human terms, could be reduced to the formula of senseless desperation provoked by senseless tyranny. What I was concerned with mainly was the aspect, the character, {{and the fate of}} the individuals as they appeared to the Western Eyes of the old teacher of languages. He himself has been much criticized; but I will not at this late hour undertake to justify his existence. He was useful to me and therefore I think that he must be useful to the reader both in the way of comment and by the part he plays {{in the development of the}} story. In my desire to produce the effect of actuality it seemed to me indispensable to have an eye-witness of the transactions in Geneva. I needed also a sympathetic friend for Miss Haldin, who otherwise would have been too much alone and unsupported to be perfectly credible. She would have had no one to whom she could give a glimpse of her idealistic faith, of her great heart, and of her simple emotions.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, doubts were abundant. To Sir George Grey, one {{important}} friend wrote (Oct. 30): “I {{think you are}} right on the score of health, to give him [Gladstone] {{the lead of the}} House; but you will see, with all his talents, he will not perceive the difference between leading and driving.” Another correspondent, of <b>special</b> <b>experience,</b> confessed to “great misgivings as to Gladstone’s tact and judgment.” “The heart of all Israel is towards him,” wrote his good friend Dean Church; “he is very great and very noble. But he is hated as much as, or more than, he is loved. He is fierce sometimes and wrathful and easily irritated; he wants knowledge of men and speaks rashly. And I look on with some trembling to see what will come of this his first attempt to lead the Commons and prove himself fit to lead England.”(107) It was pointed out that Roundell Palmer was the only powerful auxiliary on whom he could rely in debate, and should the leader himself offend the House by an indiscretion, no colleague was competent to cover his retreat or baffle the triumph of the enemy. His first public appearance as leader of the House of Commons and associate premier was made at Glasgow, and his friends were relieved and exultant. The point on which they trembled was caution, and at Glasgow he was caution personified.|$|E
6000|$|... 177 It even {{appears to}} me that the {{calculation}} of chances, where there [...] are no data grounded either on <b>special</b> <b>experience</b> or on special [...] inference, must, in an immense majority of cases, break down, from [...] sheer impossibility of assigning any principle by which to be guided [...] in setting out the list of possibilities. In the case of the colored [...] balls we have no difficulty in making the enumeration, because we [...] ourselves determine what the possibilities shall be. But suppose a [...] case more analogous to those which occur in nature: instead of three [...] colors, let there be in the box all possible colors, we being [...] supposed ignorant of the comparative frequency with which different [...] colors occur in nature, or in the productions of art. How is the [...] list of cases to be made out? Is every distinct shade to count as a [...] color? If so, is the test to be a common eye, or an educated eye—a [...] painter’s, for instance? On the answer to these questions would [...] depend whether the chances against some particular color would be [...] estimated at ten, twenty, or perhaps five hundred to one. While if [...] we knew from experience that the particular color occurs on an [...] average a certain number of times in every hundred or thousand, we [...] should not require to know any thing either of the frequency or of [...] the number of the other possibilities.|$|E

25|$|For Peirce, First Philosophy, {{which he}} also called cenoscopy, is less basic than {{mathematics}} and more basic than the special sciences (of nature and mind). It studies positive phenomena in general, phenomena available to any person at any waking moment, {{and does not}} settle questions by resorting to <b>special</b> <b>experiences.</b> He divided such philosophy into (1) phenomenology (which he also called phaneroscopy or categorics), (2) normative sciences (esthetics, ethics, and logic), and (3) metaphysics; his views on them are discussed in order below.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Rossetti cites it as {{an example}} of what she felicitously calls [...] "an ambiguity, not hazy, but prismatic, and {{therefore}} not really perplexing." [...] She gives us accordingly our choice of two interpretations, [...] "'each cries out on account of the second death which he is suffering,' and 'each cries out for death to come a second time and ease him of his sufferings.'"[194] Buti says: [...] "Here one doubts what the author meant by the second death, and as for me I think he meant the last damnation, which shall be at the day of judgment, because they would wish through envy that it had already come, that they might have more companions, since the first death is the first damnation, when the soul parted from the body is condemned to the pains of hell for its sins. The second is when, resuscitated at the judgment day, they shall be finally condemned, soul and body together.... It may otherwise be understood as annihilation." [...] Imola says, [...] "Each would wish to die again, if he could, {{to put an end to}} his pain. Do not hold with some who think that Dante calls the second death the day of judgment," [...] and then quotes a passage from St. Augustine which favors that view. Pietro di Dante gives us four interpretations among which to choose, the first being that, [...] "allegorically, depraved and vicious men are in a certain sense dead in reputation, and this is the first death; the second is that of the body." [...] This we believe to be the true meaning. Dante himself, in a letter to the [...] "most rascally (scelestissimis) dwellers in Florence," [...] gives us the key: [...] "but you, transgressors of the laws of God and man, whom the direful maw of cupidity hath enticed not unwilling to every crime, does not the terror of the second death torment you?" [...] Their first death was in their sins, the second is what they may expect from the just vengeance of the Emperor Henry VII. The world Dante leads us through is that of his own thought, and it need not surprise us therefore if we meet in it purely imaginary beings like Tristrem[195] and Renoard of the club.[196] His personality is so strongly marked that it is nothing more than natural that his poem should be interpreted as if only he and his opinions, prejudices, or passions were concerned. He would not have been the great poet he was if he had not felt intensely and humanly, but he could never have won the cosmopolitan place he holds had he not known how to generalize his <b>special</b> <b>experience</b> into something mediatorial for all of us. Pietro di Dante in his comment on the thirty-first canto of the Purgatorio says that [...] "unless you understand him and his figures allegorically, you will be deceived by the bark," [...] and adds that our author made his pilgrimage as the representative of the rest (in, persona ceterorum).[197] To give his vision reality, he has adapted it to the vulgar mythology, but to understand it as the author meant, it must be taken in the larger sense. To confine it to Florence or to Italy is to banish it from the sympathies of mankind. It was not from the campanile of the Badia that Dante got his views of life and man.|$|E
