40|$|ABSTRACT: Ab initio {{and density}} {{functional}} calculations predict that intramolecular homolytic substitution reactions of oxyacyl radicals at the selenium atom in ω-alkylseleno-substituted radicals proceed via mechanisms {{that do not}} involve hypervalent intermediates. When the leaving radical is tert-butyl, energy barriers ("G‡) for these reactions range from 27. 1 (G 3 (MP 2) -RAD) kJ mol− 1 {{for the formation of}} the five-membered cyclic <b>selenocarbonate</b> (6) to 41. 5 kJ mol− 1 for the six-membered <b>selenocarbonate</b> (8). G 3 (MP 2) -RAD calculations predict rate coefficients in theorder of 105 – 108 s− 1 and 102 – 105 s− 1 for the formationof 6 and 8, respectively, at 298. 15 K in the gas phase.

40|$|Electrochemical {{reduction}} of diselenides allows {{the formation of}} selenide anions which react with different chloroformates yielding the corresponding <b>selenocarbonates</b> in moderate to very high yields. The reaction is general and prevents the use of further reagents or drastic reaction conditions. Moreover the use of labile or air sensitive precursors such as selenides is avoided...|$|R
