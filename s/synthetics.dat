5|$|Vincent DiStephano (Raymond Cruz), a United Systems Military soldier sent {{to capture}} {{the crew of the}} Betty, is {{captured}} by the mercenaries {{when the rest of the}} soldiers are killed by the Aliens. He agrees to cooperate with the survivors to escape from the Auriga. When Call's identity as an Auton is revealed, DiStephano summarizes their history as second-generation <b>synthetics</b> created by other <b>synthetics</b> as sleeper agents. After DiStephano and the group board the Betty, the ship's cargo hatch is stuck open; when Call tries to fix it, she is confronted by the stowaway Newborn. DiStephano checks on her and is caught by the Newborn, which crushes his skull.|$|E
5|$|David was {{conceptualized}} {{as a character}} to provide a non-human perspective for the theme of meeting one's creators in Prometheus, with him representing the next generation {{in a line of}} creators who finds himself disillusioned by his predecessors. Fassbender, who was director Ridley Scott's first choice for the role, helped fashion the character to share traits with T. E. Lawrence, who was a source of inspiration as a control freak caught between two cultures- the cultures being humanity and <b>synthetics,</b> in David's case. As the series progresses, David's behaviors and motivations evolve from a mysterious agent with ambiguous motivations to a character directly opposing the well-being of humanity.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} makes {{their way through}} the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the xenomorph so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is {{revealed}} to be an auton, an improved version of a human created by <b>synthetics.</b> Using her ability to interface with the Aurigas systems, Call sets it {{on a collision course with}} Earth, hoping to destroy the xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the xenomorphs towards him. Ripley 8 is captured by a xenomorph, while the others head for the Betty. Wren, who is already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to his chest just as the xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wren's head too, killing them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile xenomorph.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry firmly {{believed}} that throwaway clothes were {{the future of}} the industry, and this idea was incorporated into the costumes of The Motion Picture. William Ware Theiss, the designer who created the original television series costumes, was too busy to work on the film. Instead Robert Fletcher, considered one of American theater's most successful costume and scenic designers, was selected to design the new uniforms, suits, and robes for the production. Fletcher eschewed man-made <b>synthetics</b> for natural materials, finding that these fabrics sewed better and lasted longer. As times had changed, the Starfleet uniforms, with their bright reds, blues, greens, and golds, had to be revised: the miniskirts worn by females in the original series would now be considered sexist. Wise deemed the original multicolored uniforms too garish, and Fletcher {{believed that}} the brightness of these old designs would work against believability when seen on the wide screen—the designer's first task was to create new, less conspicuous uniforms.|$|E
5|$|A {{hallmark}} of director Sir Ridley Scott {{is the theme}} of artificial intelligence present in his science fiction films. Scott's earliest foray into the philosophy of artificial intelligence was with the android character Ash, in the original Alien film released in 1979. Ian Holm portrayed Ash as a character who may uncannily assume a human form, yet he maintains a sense of superiority that is only humbled {{by the nature of the}} Alien, which runs counter to the very future of the human race. In the book The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott, the authors- Adam Barkman, Ashley Barkman and Nancy Kang- reason that though Ash is designed to appear human, his innards are bio-mechanical and he himself does not presume to be a sentient being with a semblance of life, but an artificial construct whose personality is dictated by machinery. Every subsequent installment in the Alien film series directed by Scott features at least one synthetic (android) character designated to maintain order aboard their respective space ship. In 2017, Scott explained that the <b>synthetics</b> featured in the Alien films he directed are designed to subvert their robotic nature and to impeccably mimic humans. The original form of androids introduced in Alien would contradict the observable nature of David in Prometheus; though both would serve the same corporate masters and have the same non-human innards, David would identify himself as a sentient entity who is capable of expressing - if not feeling - emotion.|$|E

25|$|To {{stay warm}} in a {{membrane}} suit, the wearer must wear an insulating undersuit, today typically made with polyester or other synthetic fiber batting. Polyester and other <b>synthetics</b> are preferred over natural materials, since synthetic materials have better insulating properties when damp or wet from sweat, seepage, or a leak.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} {{majority}} of grown diamond substitutes, the idea of producing single-crystal cubic zirconia arose in the minds of scientists seeking a new and versatile material for use in lasers and other optical applications. Its production eventually exceeded that of earlier <b>synthetics,</b> such as synthetic strontium titanate, synthetic rutile, YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet) and GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet).|$|E
25|$|World War II {{interrupted}} the silk trade from Asia, and silk prices increased dramatically. U.S. industry {{began to look}} for substitutes, {{which led to the}} use of <b>synthetics</b> such as nylon. Synthetic silks have also been made from lyocell, a type of cellulose fiber, and are often difficult to distinguish from real silk (see spider silk for more on synthetic silks).|$|E

25|$|Investors who {{primarily}} {{trade in}} futures may hedge their futures against synthetic futures. A synthetic {{in this case}} is a synthetic future comprising a call and a put position. Long synthetic futures means long call and short put at the same expiry price. To hedge against a long futures trade a short position in <b>synthetics</b> can be established, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Turquoise is an opaque, blue-to-green mineral {{that is a}} {{hydrated}} phosphate {{of copper}} and aluminium, with the chemical formula CuAl6(PO4)4(OH)8·4H2O. It is rare and valuable in finer grades and has been prized as a gemstone and ornamental stone {{for thousands of years}} owing to its unique hue. In recent times, turquoise has been devalued, like most other opaque gems, by the introduction onto the market of treatments, imitations, and <b>synthetics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Morphine-derived agonist–antagonist {{drugs have}} also been developed. Elements of the {{morphine}} structure {{have been used to}} create completely synthetic drugs such as the morphinan family (levorphanol, dextromethorphan and others) and other groups that have many members with morphine-like qualities. The modification of morphine and the aforementioned <b>synthetics</b> has also given rise to non-narcotic drugs with other uses such as emetics, stimulants, antitussives, anticholinergics, muscle relaxants, local anaesthetics, general anaesthetics, and others.|$|E
25|$|During this period, {{synthetic}} chelates such as {{ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid}} (EDTA) were being developed. These applied the same concept of chelation and did create chelated compounds; but these <b>synthetics</b> were too stable and not nutritionally viable. If the mineral {{was taken from}} the EDTA ligand, the ligand could not be used by the body and would be expelled. During the expulsion process the EDTA ligand randomly chelated and stripped another mineral from the body.|$|E
25|$|In a wet {{processes}} a compound, lubricant, or barreling soap {{is added}} to aid the finishing process, prevent rusting, and to clean parts. A wide variety of media is available to achieve the desired finished product. Common media materials include: sand, granite chips, slag, steel, ceramics, and <b>synthetics.</b> Moreover, these materials are available {{in a wide variety}} of shapes. Usually different shapes are used in the same load to reach into every geometry of the part.|$|E
25|$|Fly tying {{material}} {{can be anything}} used to construct a fly on a hook. Traditional materials were threads, yarns, furs, feathers, hair, tinsels, cork, balsa and wire. Today's materials include not only all sorts of natural and dyed furs, hair and feathers, but also {{a wide array of}} synthetic materials. Rabbit, mink, muskrat, fox, bear, squirrel and other furs, deer, elk, moose hair and chicken, pheasant, turkey, duck, goose and partridge feathers are commonly incorporated into artificial flies. Chicken neck and saddle hackle, so essential for many artificial fly patterns, are from animals especially bred to produce hackles of superior performance and color. <b>Synthetics</b> have allowed fly tyers to replicate rare and sometimes endangered furs and feathers as well as create completely new types of flies. <b>Synthetics</b> such as rubber legs, plastic wings and transparent plastic cords, chenilles, and all sorts and colors of flashy materials that can be incorporated into the wings and bodies of today's artificial fly are available to the 21st-century fly tyer. Whereas lead wire was the traditional method of weighting flies, today's weighting materials include glass, brass and tungsten beads and cones as well as lead. Silicone, epoxy, kevlar thread and other modern materials are regularly incorporated in artificial fly patterns.|$|E
25|$|Many modern {{perfumes}} contain synthesized odorants. <b>Synthetics</b> {{can provide}} fragrances {{which are not}} found in nature. For instance, Calone, a compound of synthetic origin, imparts a fresh ozonous metallic marine scent that is widely used in contemporary perfumes. Synthetic aromatics are often used as an alternate source of compounds that are not easily obtained from natural sources. For example, linalool and coumarin are both naturally occurring compounds that can be inexpensively synthesized from terpenes. Orchid scents (typically salicylates) are usually not obtained directly from the plant itself but are instead synthetically created to match the fragrant compounds found in various orchids.|$|E
25|$|The Butibori {{industrial}} area {{is one of}} the largest in Asia in terms of area. The estate's largest unit is Indo Rama <b>Synthetics,</b> which manufactures synthetic polyester yarn. Other units in Butibori include the power transmission company Gammon India Limited (T & D), Gammon India Ltd. (Infra), KEC, ACE Refractories, Hyundai Unitech, ACC Nihon Castings Ltd and Electrolux. CEAT Tyres has announced its plans to invest Rs. 400 crore in a state-of-the-art tyre plant in Butibori, Nagpur. Devendra Fadnavis, Chief Minister of Maharashtra, laid the cornerstone for the plant that will be set up in three phases. In the first phase (2014– 2016), Rs. 400 crore will be invested.|$|E
25|$|A childlike AI appears, proclaiming {{itself the}} Catalyst and {{the creator of}} the Reapers. It reveals that the Reapers cull and {{preserve}} organics advanced by <b>synthetics</b> to allow more primitive species to evolve, with the Catalyst aiming to find a solution, but now conceding defeat to Shepard. Shepard must finally decide how to activate the Crucible: destroy the Reapers and all synthetic life, seize control of the Reapers, or synthesize organic and synthetic life together. The activation results in Shepard's death and the mass relay network being destroyed. However, if Shepard destroys the Reapers with a high enough Effective Military Strength (EMS), he/she will instead take a gasping breath from within a pile of rubble and survive.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominant}} {{focus of}} development in the chemical industry is to expand the output of chemical fertilizers, plastics, and synthetic fibers. The growth of this industry has placed China among the world's leading producers of nitrogenous fertilizers. In the consumer goods sector the main emphasis is on textiles and clothing, which also form {{an important part of}} China's exports. Textile manufacturing, a rapidly growing proportion of which consists of <b>synthetics,</b> account for about 10 percent of the gross industrial output and continues to be important, but less so than before. The industry tends to be scattered throughout the country, but {{there are a number of}} important textile centers, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Harbin.|$|E
25|$|Emerald is a {{rare and}} {{valuable}} gemstone and, as such, it has provided the incentive for developing synthetic emeralds. Both hydrothermal and flux-growth <b>synthetics</b> have been produced. The first commercially successful emerald synthesis process was that of Carroll Chatham. The other large producer of flux emeralds was Pierre Gilson Sr., which {{has been on the}} market since 1964. Gilson's emeralds are usually grown on natural colorless beryl seeds which become coated on both sides. Growth occurs at the rate of 1mm per month, a typical seven-month growth run producing emerald crystals of 7mm of thickness. The green color of emeralds is widely attributed to presence of Cr3+ ions. Intensely green beryls from Brazil, Zimbabwe and elsewhere in which the color is attributed to vanadium have also been sold and certified as emeralds.|$|E
25|$|Morphine was {{the most}} {{commonly}} abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of dihydromorphine (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, {{there were no other}} drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with <b>synthetics</b> still several years away (pethidine was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), ethylmorphine (Dionine), and benzylmorphine (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause hydromorphone, oxymorphone, high-dose oxycodone, or methadone as well as dextromoramide in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of dihydrocodeine, poppy straw derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, propoxyphene, and tramadol.|$|E

500|$|Despite the lukewarm {{reception}} of the Alien prequel films, Michael Fassbender's portrayal of David was met with critical acclaim, with his performance {{generally considered to be}} the standout. Following the critics screening of Prometheus in May 2012, critics from a number of media companies, including /Film and Screen International, proclaimed Fassbender to have been the highlight of the film. Forrest Wickman of Slate magazine lauded Fassbender for being able to emulate uncanny valley through his mannerisms alone and ranked David as being the greatest portrayal of an android to date. Philip French from The Guardian praised the character for being a cross between the fictional valet Jeeves, created by P. G. Wodehouse, and a double agent commonly found in an English Renaissance theatre production. French further complimented the character for paying homage to T. E. Lawrence by being portrayed as a control freak caught between two cultures- the parallel in Prometheus being that David is caught between humanity and <b>synthetics.</b> Referencing the Titan Prometheus of Greek mythology, Kwaak Je-yup stated in his review of Prometheus that Fassbender [...] "steals fire" [...] in every scene, upstaging Noomi Rapace's leading performance as Shaw.|$|E

500|$|In the wild, M. campanulae seal {{off their}} cells within the nest with natural resins found in plants and trees. In 2013, however, {{researchers}} {{reported that the}} bees had used <b>synthetics,</b> including caulk, to seal the cells. [...] Compositional analysis of these materials revealed calcium, titanium, and iron. [...] They resembled polyurethane-based sealants typically used in building construction. [...] It {{is not uncommon for}} insects to live inside found objects made of plastic. [...] However, these findings are the first known of insects actually building nests with plastic. [...] With help from citizen scientists in Toronto, over 200 nest boxes were placed throughout the city. [...] Scanning electron microscopy, x-ray microanalysis, and infrared microscopy were employed in identification of polymeric specimens. [...] Researchers suggest the bees' behavior may be an example of adaptive behavior. Since some of the bees were free of parasites, these novel and possibly more robust methods of nest building may offer additional protection. [...] Incorporation of plastic into the walls and sealants of the cell nests appeared to provide some protection against brood parasite invasion. [...] However, use of these more readily available synthetic materials, in an urban setting, may be incidental. [...] In fact, exposure of brood to polyurethane and polyethylene based plastics could be detrimental, as the Canadian team noted, since diffusion of moisture could be inhibited. [...] Some of the brood specimens were heavily affected by mold growth. [...] Additionally, synthetic materials in the nest might hinder the bees ability to move and breath.
