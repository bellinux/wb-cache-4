In April to May 2007 and 2008, {{consecutive}} prescribed {{fires were}} conducted in a 121 ha compartment on the FEF that had been relatively free of management {{for the past two}} decades except for a small strip-clearcut (≤ 5 ha) and scattered light timber stand improvement entries (T.

Treatment stands were burned using a <b>strip</b> <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> technique, ignited with hand-held drip torches after fire-blackened perimeters were established. Due to variability in leaf litter, slope, and aspect, fire intensity as assessed by post hoc flame height measurement ranged from a few centimeters to > 3.5 m (Johnson et al. 2009).|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} design {{at each site}} was a randomized complete block (Peterson 1985) with four cut-and-burn treatments and one cut-and-leave (CUT) treatment. Woodland (control) plots were present at the Bluebunch and Fescue sites. Treatments were designated by the month that fire was applied: September (SEP), January (JAN), March (MAR), and April (APR). All trees in the JAN, MAR, APR, and CUT treatments were felled in June and July, 2006. About one-third of the trees were cut in the SEP treatment; these trees were used to carry fire and kill remaining live trees. Treatment plots ranged from 0.2 ha to 0.4 ha in size with five replicates at the Bluebunch and Fescue sites and four replicates at the NGBER site. The SEP <b>fires</b> (<b>strip</b> <b>head</b> <b>fires)</b> were applied on 24, 25, and 26 Sep 2006, on the NGBER, Bluebunch, and Fescue sites, respectively. JAN fires were applied on 9, 17, and 19 Jan 2007, at the NGBER, Bluebunch, and Fescue sites, respectively. There was 5 cm to 12 cm {{of snow on the}} ground when the Fescue and NGBER sites were burned in January. MAR fires were applied on 6, 9, and 14 Mar 2007, on the NGBER, Bluebunch, and Fescue sites, respectively. APR fires were applied on 6 Apr 2007, on the Bluebunch and Fescue sites, and on 10 Apr 2007, at the NGBER site. Winter and spring burns required igniting individual or clusters of trees as snow or wet ground fuels prevented fire from carrying. Burn conditions were typical for applications used to fall broadcast burn and reduce fuel loading in winter and spring (Appendices 1 through 3).|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} 3 D {{numerical}} simulations of two <b>fires</b> fronts (<b>head</b> and backfire) propagating simultaneously through a grassland fuel. The simulations {{were carried out}} using a "fully" physical and three-dimensional fire model (namely WFDS). One of the objectives of this work, was to evaluate the potential for fully physical fire model to simulate the interactions between two <b>fire</b> fronts (a <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> and a backfire), in conditions similar to those encountered during suppression fire operations. A set of numerical simulations was first carried out for standalone <b>head</b> <b>fires</b> propagating through grasslands on a flat terrain and for various wind conditions ranging between 1 and 10 m/s. These results were compared with experimental data and numerical results from the literature. The same calculations were then repeated, with a backfire ignited at the downwind side of the plot. The numerical results highlighted that, for these particular conditions, <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> and backfire can interact, mainly, via two mechanisms: - at relatively large distances (greater than 10 m) the <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> acts on backfire as a screen and reduces the direct action of the wind flow on the backfire, - at relative small distances (nearly equal to 10 m) the gas flow (entrainment) generated {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> promotes the aspiration of the backfire towards the main fire front...|$|R

40|$|Free-burning {{experimental}} {{fires were}} conducted in a wind tunnel to explore the role of ignition type and thus fire spread mode on the resulting emissions profile from combustion of fine (< 6 mm in diameter) Eucalyptus litter fuels. Fires were burnt spreading with the wind (<b>heading</b> <b>fire),</b> perpendicular to the wind (flanking fire) and against the wind (backing fire). Greenhouse gas compounds (i. e.

Emissions factors calculated using a carbon mass balance technique (along with statistical testing) showed {{that most of the}} carbon was emitted as CO 2, with <b>heading</b> <b>fires</b> emitting 17 % more CO 2 than flanking and 9. 5 % more CO 2 than backing fires, and about twice as much CO as flanking and backing <b>fires.</b> <b>Heading</b> <b>fires</b> had less than half as much carbon remaining in combustion residues. Statistically significant differences in CH 4 and N 2 O emissions factors were not found with respect to fire spread mode.

Findings on the equivalence of different emissions factor reporting methods are discussed along with the impact of our results for emissions accounting and potential sampling biases associated with our work.

40|$|Fuel characteristics, fire {{behaviour}} and temperature were studied {{in relation to}} grazing, dominant grass type and wind direction in West African savanna–woodland by lighting 32 prescribed early fires. Grazing significantly reduced the vegetation height, total fuel load, and dead and live fuel fractions whereas plots dominated by perennial grasses had higher values for vegetation height, total fuel load and the quantity of live fuel load. Although fire intensity remained insensitive (P> 0. 05) {{to any of these}} factors, fuel consumption was significantly (P = 0. 021) reduced by grazing, rate of spread was faster in <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> (P = 0. 012), and flame length was shorter in <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> than back fire (P = 0. 044). The average maximum temperature was higher (P< 0. 05) on non-grazed plots, on plots dominated by annual grasses, on plots subjected to <b>head</b> <b>fire,</b> and at the soil surface. Lethal temperature residence time showed a nearly similar trend to fire temperature. Wind speed and total fuel load were best predictors of {{fire behaviour}} parameters (R 2 ranging from 0. 557 to 0. 862).

30|$|Fire {{intensity}} is typically characterized by measures of fire temperature {{and rate of}} spread (RoS; Keeley 2009). In all five burn units, we measured maximum temperature reached at the soil surface using 10 sets of copper tags painted with 24 temperature sensitive paints (OmegaLaq, Stamford, Connecticut, USA), ranging from 79 ° C to 760 ° C, in increments of approximately 28 ° C. We placed tags in 10 randomly chosen quadrats within each burn. At Glacial Heritage and Tenalquot, half of these quadrats experienced a <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> and half experienced a backing fire (n = 5 per burn). At these two sites, we measured RoS by timing {{the spread of the}} flaming front over a 1 m distance at two to four different locations within each burn treatment (<b>head</b> <b>fire,</b> backing fire). Additionally, we visually estimated flame lengths at the same points at which RoS measurements were taken to help characterize the fire intensity. We collected these observational data solely for the purpose of characterizing the burns and therefore did not subject them to statistical analysis.|$|R

30|$|While several {{different}} ignition patterns {{are used to}} affect fire behavior (Johansen 1987), these strategies remain largely unexplored in the fire and restoration literature. Our study suggests that fire ignition pattern influences fire severity and post-fire vegetation in Pacific Northwest prairies. Although average maximum surface temperature did not vary between the two ignition pattern treatments, a 10 -fold difference in residence time suggests that the duration of heating {{may be an important}} factor influencing vegetation response to ignition patterns. This reflects a fundamental difference between the behavior of head and backing fires: <b>head</b> <b>fires</b> spread rapidly among the tops of the grasses, spending less time on the surface, quickly influencing large acreages; backing fires have longer residence times, allowing more thorough combustion of plant material, typically over smaller areas (Keeley 2009). This pattern aligns well with our finding at Glacial Heritage that backing fires were more severe compared to <b>head</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|R
30|$|Fire intensities {{are also}} assumed to vary between {{riparian}} and upslope forests. As {{a consequence of}} topography and increased moisture input, riparian zones should retain moisture longer into the summer dry season. Moister conditions reduce flammability and subsequently reduce chances of fire ignition. Therefore, riparian zones should have a reduced flammability compared to corresponding upslope forests. Also, fire ignition location influences initial fire behavior within a stand. Lightning {{is one of the}} primary sources of forest fire ignitions in the Pacific Northwest. Topographically, the upper one-third of hill slopes experience more lightning strikes than the lower two-thirds. Slope position affects initial fire behavior since fires starting {{at the top of a}} slope are more likely to be dominated by backing and flanking fire behavior, while those starting at the bottom of the slope are more likely to be dominated by <b>heading</b> <b>fire</b> (Agee 1993; Pyne et al. 1996). <b>Heading</b> <b>fires</b> typically have a higher intensity and a higher rate of spread than backing fires. A common fire scenario is that a fire ignites from a lightning strike in the upper portion of a slope, burns to the ridge in a <b>heading</b> <b>fire</b> but does not necessarily back down the slope at the same rate or intensity, and then perhaps is extinguished once it reaches a zone of moister vegetation. Occasionally, the channeling effect of wind along headwater riparian areas can intensify fires within those areas (Agee 1994).|$|R

30|$|Ignition {{patterns}} {{could influence}} fire intensity, severity, and vegetation response to fire {{for a number}} of reasons. First, backing <b>fires</b> and <b>head</b> <b>fires</b> create fundamentally different types of <b>fire.</b> <b>Head</b> <b>fires</b> are flashy, wind-driven fires with short residence times, high rates of spread, and longer flame lengths. Backing fires are primarily fuel-driven fires, with long residence times, low rates of spread, and shorter flame lengths. These differences could have specific first- and second-order impacts on community response. In grasslands, fire intensity (as measured by maximum surface temperatures) and severity (as measured by organic matter removed) are likely to be higher in backing <b>fires</b> than in <b>head</b> <b>fires.</b> Variation in maximum temperatures and heating time {{as a result of the}} ignition pattern could have direct impacts on plant tissue death and indirect impacts on seed germination the following season. These impacts may differ based on plant life form and origin; perennials with buds less than 2 cm belowground are much more susceptible to direct fire impacts than annuals with a sufficient seed bank or long-lived woody species with insulating bark (Pyke et al. 2010). Additionally, fire-adapted native plant species may be more resistant to longer duration or higher temperature fires that are required to remove introduced species (DiTomaso et al. 2006), providing an opportunity to utilize certain ignition patterns for invasive control. For these reasons, managers may use different ignition patterns during a prescribed burn to influence fire behavior, severity, and community response (Kilgore and Curtis 1987, Van Wilgen et al. 2004).|$|R
40|$|International audienceOne of the {{objectives}} {{of this paper was}} to simulate numerically the interaction between two line fires ignited in a grassland, on a flat terrain, perpendicularly to the wind direction, {{in such a way that}} the two <b>fire</b> fronts (a <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> and a backfire) propagated in opposite directions parallel to the wind. The numerical simulations were conducted in 3 D using the new fuel element module recently implemented in WFDS. We chose a grassland for the fuel layer, because it represents certainly one of the most studied ecosystem, in the frame of experimental campaigns to study the behaviour of surface fires at large scale. The aim of this numerical study is to understand what are the physical phenomena and the favorable conditions of ignition of a counter fire, during a fire suppression operation. The preliminary results highlighted that the two fire fronts interacted only at a relative short distance (10 - 20 m), following this scenario: • The thermal plume above the <b>head</b> <b>fire</b> (representing the main fire front) formed a sort of shelter, protecting the backfire to the direct effect of the wind flow • Before the merging between the two fire fronts, an in-draft flow was observed ahead of the <b>head</b> <b>fire,</b> promoting and accelerating the propagation of the backfire During the last step of the merging of the two fire fronts, a sudden increase of the heat release rate was observed, indicating a significant interaction between the two fires, which can potentially represent a safety problem for people in charge of this kind of operation...|$|R

30|$|In the prairies of the Pacific Northwest, USA, {{fire has}} been reintroduced {{as a tool}} for {{reducing}} non-native, invasive plant cover and promoting the growth and establishment of native plant communities. <b>Head</b> <b>fires</b> and backing fires are the two primary ignition patterns used to complete most prescribed burns, but the relative effectiveness of these two methods on invasive plant control and native enhancement is unknown. A clear understanding of the relationship between fire behavior, fire severity, and fire effects on vegetation and how these metrics are affected by fire ignition patterns could help managers fine tune burn prescriptions to better achieve ecological objectives. We used observations from five prescribed burns in the south Puget Sound prairies of western Washington, USA, to evaluate the relationship between intensity, severity, and effects. Additionally, we collected data from two burns on how ignition patterns affected these relationships. We found a significant positive correlation between maximum surface temperature and fire severity, and a decline in perennial taxa with increasing fire severity. We also found that surface temperatures did not differ between ignition patterns, but a greater area burned at moderate severity in backing <b>fires</b> than in <b>head</b> <b>fires.</b> Ignition patterns differentiated plant communities by changing the number of species present within different life form categories. However, this response was contingent upon site history and pre-burn conditions. Native perennial forbs were associated with <b>head</b> <b>fires</b> in a site with high pre-existing native plant species richness. Native and exotic forbs were associated with backing fires at a site with low pre-existing native plant species richness.
