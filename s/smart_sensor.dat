40|$|Structural health {{monitoring}} (SHM) {{is an important}} tool for the ongoing maintenance of aging infrastructure. The ultimate goals of implementing an SHM system are to improve infrastructure maintenance, increase public safety, and minimize {{the economic impact of}} an extreme loading event by streamlining repair and retrofit measures. Networks of wireless <b>smart</b> <b>sensors</b> offer tremendous promise for accurate and continuous structural monitoring using a dense array of inexpensive sensors; however, hurdles still remain. Although <b>smart</b> <b>sensors</b> have been commercially available for nearly a decade, full-scale implementation for civil infrastructure has been lacking, {{with the exception of a}} few short-term demonstration projects.
