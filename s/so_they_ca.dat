More specifically, the objectives of this systematic review are to provide summarised evidence on: 1. The impact of standard precautions training on the frequency of needle stick injury among health professionals 2. Knowledge and practice change after training on standard precautions by health professionals 3. Needle stick injury morbidity, mortality and complications change after training on standard precautions among health professionals Background The emergence of life-threatening infections have highlighted the need for efficient infection control programmes in all health care settings and capacity building for health professionals <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{investigate}} one teacher’s utilization of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) by drawing context {{from two of}} his life-stories: one that he interprets as “ruin ” and the other “success. ” Methodologically grounded in narrative inquiry, this paper contains excerpts from the teacher’s authentic narratives and their interpretation {{from the perspective of}} information systems research, known as the social process model. The findings emphasize that with the dialogic involvement of educational researchers, it is possible to reach {{a deeper understanding of the}} events that influence the teacher’s experience with technology. Such synergistic alliances amongst educational researchers and teachers are key for detecting and overcoming the linguistic and operational barriers that exist between ICT theorists and practitioners.

40|$|The {{different}} social arenas in which mathematics is involved pose important challenges for mathematics education that cannot be understood {{independently of the}} multiple social functions that {{it is expected to}} fulfil (Skovsmose, 1994; D’Ambrosio, 2002; Valero, 2004). If the purpose of educa-tion is to allow societal development in a democratic way, then it is not enough for people to learn a “petrified ” math-ematics, isolated from its social implications in the world. The recognition that mathematics is present in many of our daily activities and decisions has been pushing the mathe-matics education community to rethink the aims of school mathematics (Frankenstein, 1983; Skovsmose, 1994; Gut-stein, 2003). Since most of the mathematics “ruling ” our world is hidden, students need to critically deconstruct the way in which mathematics formats reality, <b>so</b> that <b>they</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Telehealth is an {{important}} issue in the medical and healthcare domains. Although a number of systems have been developed {{to meet the demands of}} emerging telehealth services, the following problems still remain to be addressed: (1) most systems do not monitor/predict the vital signs states <b>so</b> that <b>they</b> are able to send alarms to caregivers in real-time; (2) most systems do not focus on reducing the amount of work that caregivers need to do, and provide patients with remote care; and (3) most systems do not recommend guidelines for caregivers. This study thus proposes a framework for a real-time and Continua-based Care Guideline Recommendation System (Cagurs) which utilizes mobile device platforms to provide caregivers of chronic patients with real-time care guideline recommendations, and that enables vital signs data to be transmitted between different devices automatically, using the Continua standard. Moreover, the proposed system adopts the episode mining approach to monitor/predict anomalous conditions of patients, and then offers related recommended care guidelines to caregivers <b>so</b> that <b>they</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|R
40|$|Computational {{workflows}} are {{a powerful}} paradigm to represent and manage complex applications, particularly in large-scale distributed scientific data analysis. Workflows represent application components {{that result in}} individual computations {{as well as their}} interdependencies in terms of data flow. Workflow systems use these representations to manage various aspects of workflow creation and execution for users, such as the automatic assignment of execution resources. This paper describes an approach to automating a new aspect of the process: the selection of application components and data sources. We present a novel approach that enables users to specify varying degrees of detail and amount of constraints in a workflow request, including the specification of constraints on input, intermediate, or output data in the workflow, abstract workflow component classes rather than specific component implementations, and generic reusable workflow templates that express a pre-defined combination of components. The algorithm elaborates the user request into a set of fully ground workflows with specific choices of data sources and codes to be used <b>so</b> that <b>they</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|R
40|$|Viewing {{teachers}} as leaders requires {{a paradigm shift}} about the concept of leadership in a school system. The Teachers as Leaders program of the Mountain Brook, Alabama Schools represents that shift and is empowering teachers to utilize their leadership skills {{and contribute to the}} system as it fulfills its mission to offer education to its students that is effective, challenging, and engaging. The Mountain Brook Schools established the Teachers as Leaders program in order to develop a culture of continuity in leadership as many administrator retirements were predicted for the near future. The program, however, was not designed as a “Teachers as Future Administrators ” program. Rather, it was an intentional plan to prepare teachers for continued leadership, whether that is demonstrated in their classrooms or in administrative roles. The school system partnered with private consultants, a restaurant business, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham to deliver the Teachers as Leaders program. This article, a report from the field, allows the reader a glimpse of the culture of excellence in the Mountain Brook Schools through the description of the Teachers as Leaders program and reflections of several participants. How do you create a district pool of future principals who understand and honor the culture of a school community? How do you also increase the leadership capacity of teachers <b>so</b> that <b>they</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ca 2 + {{entry into}} airway epithelia is {{important}} for activation of the NFAT family of transcription factors and expression of genes including epidermal growth factor that help orchestrate local inflammatory responses. However, the identity of epithelial Ca 2 + channel that activates these transcriptional responses is unclear. In many other non-excitable cells, store-operated Ca 2 + entry is a major route for Ca 2 + influx and is mediated by STIM 1 and Orai 1 proteins. This study was performed to determine if store-operated Ca 2 + channels were expressed in human bronchial epithelial cells and, if <b>so,</b> whether <b>they</b> coupled <b>Ca</b> 2 + entry to gene expression. Cytoplasmic Ca 2 + measurements, patch clamp recordings, RNAi knockdown and functional assays were used to identify and then investigate the role of these Ca 2 + channels in activating the NFAT and c-fos pathways and EGF expression. STIM 1 and Orai 1 mRNA transcripts as well as proteins were robustly in epithelial cells and formed functional Ca 2 + channels. Ca 2 + entry through the channels activated expression of c-fos and EGF {{as well as an}} NFAT-dependent reporter gene. Store-operated Ca 2 + entry was also important for epithelial cell migration in a scrape wound assay. These findings indicate that store-operated Ca 2 + channels {{play an important role in}} stimulating airway epithelial cell gene expression and therefore comprise a novel potential therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic asthma and related airway disorders...|$|R
