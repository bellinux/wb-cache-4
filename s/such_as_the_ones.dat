5|$|Although Sunday schools <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> {{established}} by Trimmer {{have often been}} characterized by modern scholars as a repressive device used by the middle class to impose their morality on the lower classes, Thomas Laqueur {{has argued that the}} poor embraced this opportunity to obtain literacy and disregarded many of the moral lessons forced upon them.|$|E
5|$|Despite their rarity, hurricanes {{are among}} Arizona's most {{significant}} weather makers. In years when Arizona {{is affected by}} a tropical cyclone, these can be responsible for up to 25% of the rainfall in areas along the Colorado River. Arizona hurricanes are also responsible for torrential rains in localized areas, with the state's 24-hour rainfall record— of precipitation—occurring during Hurricane Nora's landfall in 1997. The heavy rainfall can trigger extensive flash floods, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> produced by the remnants of Tropical Storm Octave in 1983, or the lingering moisture from Tropical Storm Emilia in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Galiella rufa {{produces}} several structurally related hexaketide {{compounds that}} have attracted attention for their biological properties: pregaliellalactone, galiellalactone. The compounds have anti-nematodal activity, killing the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Meloidogyne incognita. These compounds {{have been shown}} in laboratory tests to inhibit the early steps of the biosynthetic pathways induced by plant hormones known as gibberellic acids, and they also inhibit the germination of seeds of several plants. Galiellalactone is additionally a highly selective and potent inhibitor of interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling in HepG2 cells. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine which is produced by a large variety of cells and functions as a regulator of immune response, acute phase reactions, and hematopoiesis. Researchers {{are interested in the}} potential of small-molecule inhibitors (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> produced by G.rufa) to interfere with the IL-6 signaling cascade that leads to the expression of genes involved in disease.|$|E

25|$|According to Victor Segalen's assessment, {{the early}} (Han and the Six Dynasties) stone {{tortoises}} were artistic images of quite real aquatic turtles.

25|$|Limitations <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> above {{present an}} {{important}} legal vacuum {{for renewable energy}} in Colombia.

25|$|Carnot's Theorem {{states that}} {{the sum of the}} {{distances}} from the circumcenter to the three sides equals the sum of the circumradius and the inradius. Here a segment's length is considered to be negative if and only if the segment lies entirely outside the triangle. This method is especially useful for deducing the properties of more abstract forms of triangles, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> induced by Lie algebras, that otherwise have the same properties as usual triangles.|$|E

50|$|Hummingbird Photo was {{established}} in 1983, it was a chain of photo developing labs {{that emerged in the}} 1980s. They were located within the Lehigh Valley (PA) region.

In contrast, other locations <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> within <b>the</b> Lehigh Valley Mall were smaller. Its logo composed of a green hummingbird. All Hummingbird Photo locations closed down in 2002, due to competition from digital cameras.|$|R
25|$|A bread clip is {{a device}} {{used to hold}} plastic bags, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> pre-sliced bread is {{commonly}} packaged in, closed. They are also commonly called bread tags, bread tabs, bread ties, bread crimps, or bread-bag clips. By sealing a bag more securely than tying or folding over its open end, the clip or tie may preserve its contents longer. The bread clip was invented in 1952 by Floyd Paxton of Yakima, Washington. Paxton never patented the device.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-two {{unprofitable}} {{and minor}} food stores, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> at Ripon and Balham, were closed in early 2009 {{as part of}} a cost cutting measure. In August 2010, it was confirmed that the Grantham branch of M would close, along with two other Lincolnshire branches in Skegness and Scunthorpe due to low sales in these older format stores. The closures were met with protests from the local communities and petitions were signed in support of retaining the stores, although they went ahead.|$|E
25|$|With a {{partitioning}} algorithm <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> {{described above}} (even with one that chooses good pivot values), quicksort exhibits poor performance for inputs that contain many repeated elements. The problem is clearly apparent {{when all the}} input elements are equal: at each recursion, the left partition is empty (no input values are less than the pivot), and the right partition has only decreased by one element (the pivot is removed). Consequently, the algorithm takes quadratic time to sort an array of equal values.|$|E
