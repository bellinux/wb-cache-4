25|$|Suffolk has a {{comprehensive}} education system with fourteen independent schools. Unusually for the UK, some of Suffolk has a 3-tier {{school system in}} place with primary schools (ages 5–9), middle schools (ages 9–13) and upper schools (ages 13–16). However, a 2006 Suffolk County Council study concluded that Suffolk should move to the 2-tier school system used {{in the majority of}} the UK. For the purpose of conversion to 2-tier, the 3-tier system has been divided into 4 geographical area groupings and corresponding phases. The first phase was the conversion of schools in Lowestoft and Haverhill in 2011, followed by schools in north and west Suffolk in 2012. The remainder of the changeovers to 2-tier will take place from 2013, for those schools that stay within Local government control, and not become Academies and/or free schools. The majority of schools thus now (2013) operate the more common primary to high school (11–16). Many of the county's upper schools have a sixth form and most further education colleges in the county offer A-level courses. In terms of <b>school</b> <b>population,</b> Suffolk's individual schools are large with the Ipswich district with the largest <b>school</b> <b>population</b> and Forest Heath the smallest, with just two schools.|$|E

Haredim and Arab citizens are underrepresented in both the Israel Defense Forces and the workforce, since both groups are exempt from the otherwise compulsory military service, and in many Haredi sects men choose to focus only on religious studies throughout their life and rely financially on support from co-religionists, the State, etc.|$|E
25|$|The total high <b>school</b> <b>population</b> was now {{approaching}} 2,400. The same committee which {{concluded that}} physical additions were needed also recommended a new organizational plan to prevent students from feeling depersonalized {{in such a}} large system. What grew out of this was the House Plan, which, in 1970, divided Columbia into four sub-schools of approximately 600 students each. The goal was to provide the intimacy of a small school within a large plant, {{and each of the}} houses had, for example, its own student council, intramural athletic teams, and newspapers. All of these were in addition to the traditional school-wide activities.|$|E
