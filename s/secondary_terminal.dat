25|$|Mild {{androgen}} insensitivity syndrome (MAIS) is {{a condition}} that results in a mild impairment of the cell's {{ability to respond to}} androgens.

25|$|MAIS is only {{diagnosed}} in normal phenotypic males, {{and is not}} typically investigated except in cases of male infertility. MAIS has a mild presentation that often goes unnoticed and untreated; even with semenological, clinical and laboratory data, {{it can be difficult}} to distinguish between men with and without MAIS, and thus a diagnosis of MAIS is not usually made without confirmation of an AR gene mutation. The androgen sensitivity index (ASI), defined as the product of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (T), is frequently raised in individuals with all forms of AIS, including MAIS, although many individuals with MAIS have an ASI in the normal range. Testosterone levels may be elevated despite normal levels of luteinizing hormone. Conversion of testosterone (T) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) may be impaired, although to a lesser extent than is seen in 5α-reductase deficiency. A high ASI in a normal phenotypic male, especially when combined with azoospermia or oligospermia, decreased <b>secondary</b> <b>terminal</b> hair, and/or impaired conversion of T to DHT, can be indicative of MAIS, and may warrant genetic testing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{concept of}} {{cognitive}} radio (or secondary spec-trum access) is currently under investigation as a promising paradigm to achieve {{efficient use of}} the frequency resource. In this paper, we consider a decentralized cognitive radio model based on spectrum leasing, whereby a primary (licensed) user leases its bandwidth {{for a fraction of}} time to a network of independent <b>secondary</b> (unlicensed) <b>terminals</b> in exchange for cooperation. On one hand, the primary user decides whether to exploit (space-time coded) cooperation from the network of <b>secondary</b> <b>terminals</b> in order to maximize its own transmis-sion rate. On the other hand, <b>secondary</b> <b>terminals</b> accept to cooperate with the primary only if compensated with a large enough fraction of time for their own transmission, towards the goal of maximizing their rate discounted by the overall cost of transmitted power. The considered model is studied in the framework of Stackelberg games, with the primary and the set of secondary users modelled as the (Stackelberg) game leader and the follower, respectively. Numerical results show that spectrum leasing based on trading secondary spectrum access for cooperation is a promising framework for cognitive radio. I...|$|R

50|$|The knee-point voltage of {{a current}} {{transformer}} is {{the magnitude of}} the secondary voltage above which the output current ceases to linearly follow the input current within declared accuracy.

The knee point is defined as the voltage at which a 10% increase in applied voltage increases the magnetizing current by 50%. For voltages greater than the knee point, the magnetizing current increases considerably even for small increments in voltage across the <b>secondary</b> <b>terminals.</b> The knee-point voltage is less applicable for metering current transformers as their accuracy is generally much higher, but constrained within a very small range of the current transformer rating, typically 1.2 to 1.5 times rated current.

30|$|Three major {{cognitive}} radio paradigms that consider {{different degrees of}} interaction between primary and secondary users have been identified: interweave, underlay and overlay[1, 2]. Interweave {{cognitive radio}} is conceptually the simplest one: the secondary devices sense the environment to detect the presence of primary users and transmit opportunistically only when these are silent. Underlay cognitive radio goes one step further and permits communication between secondary users {{as long as the}} disturbance created to the primary system is below some predefined threshold. Clearly, in this case, the <b>secondary</b> <b>terminals</b> need not only assess whether primary users are transmitting or not but also how much interference they will create and whether this will disrupt the primary communication. Finally, the overlay paradigm allows for a tight interaction between primary and secondary systems. Of course, this comes not only at the price of a higher degree of sophistication of the <b>secondary</b> <b>terminals</b> but also requires flexibility in the primary system. Nevertheless, in all three cases, it is necessary {{to assess the impact of}} the presence of secondary users on primary systems. Several measures have been discussed in the literature for this purpose, for example, the probabilities of miss detection and interference for interweave cognitive radio or, more in general, soft- and peak-power-shaping interference temperature constraints[3, 4]. An alternative is to consider directly the degradation suffered by the primary users, for example, in terms of the loss in rate[5].|$|R
