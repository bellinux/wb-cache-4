25|$|With {{the advent}} of {{large-scale}} ranches worked by extended families with staffs of cowboys, wranglers and hired help, Jackson Hole saw the construction of planned complexes of buildings, as opposed to ad hoc assemblages of sheds and cabins. The new structures used milled lumber and typical western carpentry details in keeping with Wyoming construction practices. The working ranches moved away from rustic design, reflecting a maturing social order in the newly populated valley, which by 1909 had three sawmills to provide <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber.</b>|$|E
25|$|The primary graphic motifs of constructivism {{were the}} {{rectangular}} {{bar and the}} triangular wedge, others were the more basic geometries of the square and the circle. In his series Prouns, El Lizzitzky assembled collections of geometries at various angles floating free in space. They evoke basic structural units such as bars of steel or <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber</b> loosely attached, piled, or scattered. They were also often drafted and share aspects with technical drawing and engineering drawing. Similar in composition is the deconstructivist series Micromegas by Daniel Libeskind.|$|E
25|$|On 29 October 2009 the Russian Navy finally {{delivered}} the Arctic Sea to Malta where, after an inspection by Maltese authorities, it {{was allowed to}} enter harbour and was returned to its owner. The four crewmen, including the vessel's master, who had remained with the vessel after its seizure by the Russian Navy off the Cape Verde Islands returned to Russia. Solchart Ltd. flew a new crew to Valletta where they remanned the vessel. Repairs were made {{during the week of}} 3 November and then the ship finally delivered its cargo of <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber</b> to Algeria. The arrested alleged hijackers continue to be subjected to criminal procedures in Moscow.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{the economy}} {{was based on the}} cod and salmon fishery, forestry, {{including}} <b>sawing</b> <b>lumber</b> and cutting wood for the Corner Brook Pulp and Paper Mill.|$|R
50|$|About 1880, John R. Huey built a mill {{several miles}} down Rocky Creek from the Jennings mill to grind wheat and corn, {{as well to}} <b>saw</b> <b>lumber.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1855 North started work on the dam and a $4,000 saw mill which began <b>sawing</b> <b>lumber</b> about the first of December of that year.|$|R
2500|$|Fowlds, at Hastings, also {{manufactured}} {{from two}} to three million feet of <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber</b> annually ... which at Port Hope was worth $12 per 1000 feet. [...] It originally had a foundry, a cotton factory, grist mills, a stone Roman Catholic Church, Church of England and Presbyterian and Methodist Churches.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was with}} a lighter heart and many good wishes that I rode out again, and {{eventually}} reached Coombs' homestead, where a welcome {{of a different kind}} awaited me. The house was well built of <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber,</b> and backed by a thin birch bluff, while there was no difficulty in setting down its owner as an Englishman of a kind that fortunately is not common. He was stout and flabby in face, with a smug, self-satisfied air I did not like. Leaning against a paddock rail, he looked me over while I told him what had brought me there. Then he said, with no trace of Western accent, which, it afterward appeared, he affected to despise: ...|$|E
60|$|Vainly the borderman {{strained}} ears {{to catch}} some low night-signal given by waiting Indians {{to the white}} traitor within the settlement. By day there was even less to attract the sharp-eyed watcher. The clumsy river boats, half raft, half <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber,</b> drifted down the Ohio on their first and last voyage, discharged their cargoes of grain, liquor, or merchandise, and were broken up. Their crews came back on the long overland journey to Fort Pitt, there to man another craft. The garrison at the fort performed their customary duties; the pioneers tilled the fields; the blacksmith scattered sparks, the wheelwright worked industriously at his bench, and the housewives attended to their many cares. No strangers arrived at Fort Henry. The quiet life of the village was uninterrupted.|$|E
50|$|In 1867, a log dam {{was built}} across the Cottonwood River, and a wooden-frame mill was {{constructed}} for <b>sawing</b> <b>lumber.</b> The following year (1868) it was converted to grind flour and named Cedar Point Mill.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} some years, more {{people came to}} the area. They built not only farms but mills for <b>sawing</b> <b>lumber,</b> fulling, dyeing, carding, wool-making, and {{grinding}} flour, {{as well as the}} manufacture of clothing.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} mills used to dot {{the length of}} the Salt River and its tributaries, using the water to grind feed and flour, <b>saw</b> <b>lumber</b> and more. These include those of Bullitt's Lick and Bell's Mill on Floyd's Fork.|$|R
60|$|So when {{we reached}} the station Harry volunteered to find the best doctor in the timber city--for hewn stone had only begun to replace <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber</b> then--and arrange for transit to Wilson's house; because he said that it was my {{particular}} duty to tell Colonel Carrington and Grace. An hour passed before I traced them, and then I found them at a function given to celebrate the starting of some new public enterprise, and it was with hesitation that, followed by Calvert, I entered the vestibule of the brilliantly lighted hall. We gave a message to a bland Chinese attendant, and waited until returning he beckoned us through a crimson curtain, which swung to behind, and I found myself standing bewildered under a blaze of light in a ball-room.|$|E
6000|$|The St. Lawrence on {{the last}} day of the voyage played up nobly. The maples along its banks had turned--blood red and splendid as the banners of lost youth. Even the oak is not more of a {{national}} tree than the maple, and the sight of its welcome made the folks aboard still more happy. A dry wind brought along all the clean smell of their Continent-mixed odours of <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber,</b> virgin earth, and wood-smoke; and they snuffed it, and their eyes softened as they, identified point after point along their own beloved River--places where they played and fished and amused themselves in holiday time. It must be pleasant to have a country of one's very own to show off. Understand, they did not in any way boast, shout, squeak, or exclaim, these even-voiced returned men and women. They were simply and unfeignedly glad to see home again, and they said: 'Isn't it lovely? Don't you think it's beautiful? We love it.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{walked on}} with the fine, dry snow the wind whipped up glistening on his furs, and on {{reaching}} the homestead went first to the stable. It was built of sod, which was cheaper and warmer than <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber,</b> and, lighting a lantern, he fed his teams. The heavy Clydesdales and lighter driving horses were all valuable, for Clarke was a successful farmer and had found that {{the purchase of the}} best animals and implements led to economy, though it was said he seldom paid the full market price for them. He had walked home because it was impossible to keep warm driving, and felt tired and morose. The man had passed his prime and was beginning to find the labour he had never shirked more irksome than it had been, while he dispensed with a hired hand in winter, when there was less to be done. Clarke neglected no opportunity of saving a dollar.|$|E
50|$|In 1877, J. B. Holmes and B. D. Holmes built a mill to <b>saw</b> <b>lumber</b> and {{shingles}} at {{the site}} of March Rapids on the Big Eau Pleine River in the pine forest of central Wisconsin. A village named Hope formed around the mill, with possibly 75 inhabitants.|$|R
50|$|The {{second part}} of the {{industry}} involved the trade of <b>sawed</b> <b>lumber,</b> and the American lumber barons and lasted chiefly from about 1850 to 1900-1910. The Reciprocity Treaty caused a shift to American markets. The source of timber in Britain changed, where its access to timber in the Baltic region was restored, and it no longer provided the protective tariffs. Entrepreneurs in the United States at that time then began to build their operations near the Ottawa River, creating some of the world's largest sawmills at the time. These men, known as lumber barons, with names such as John Rudolphus Booth and Henry Franklin Bronson created mills which contributed to the prosperity and growth of Ottawa. The <b>sawed</b> <b>lumber</b> industry benefited from transportation improvements, first the Rideau Canal linking Ottawa with Kingston, Ontario on Lake Ontario, and much later railways that began to be created between Canadian cities.|$|R
500|$|In {{terms of}} board feet, {{the peak of}} the lumber era in Pennsylvania arrived in about 1885, when [...] went through the boom at Williamsport. These logs {{produced}} a total of about [...] (533,000m3) of <b>sawed</b> <b>lumber.</b> After that, production steadily declined throughout the state. Lock Haven's timber business was also affected by flooding, which badly damaged the canals and destroyed the log boom in 1889.|$|R
60|$|Railroad-building {{in such a}} land is {{an arduous}} task, needing a bold {{conception}} and a reckless execution, while no line is ever driven that is not partly paid for with the adventurous legion's blood. Our share, however, {{was one of the}} safest, for it consisted in hewing logs out of the forest for framing the spidery trestles and snow-sheds, hauling <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber</b> into position, and doing general teamster's work. Risks there were of course--the rush of a charging boulder, or a sudden descent of shale, while occasionally a partly grubbed out trunk came thundering down before it was expected to. Comparatively few trained mechanics could be found among all the men about us, and, as usual, the hardest part of the struggle devolved upon the reckless free-lances--sailor-men deserters, unfortunate prospectors, forest ranchers whose possessions were mortgaged to the hilt, and others of the kind, who are always to the front when at the risk of life and limb a new way for civilization is hewn through the forests of the Pacific Slope.|$|E
50|$|Timber {{there also}} {{describes}} <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber</b> {{not less than}} 5 inches (127 mm) in its smallest dimension. The latter includes the often partly finished lumber used in timber-frame construction.|$|E
50|$|The two-story {{frame house}} has two rooms downstairs and two upstairs. A lean-to kitchen {{addition}} to the rear {{did not make the}} journey from Iowa to Wyoming. The house is constructed of <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber</b> with larger hand-hewn timbers.|$|E
50|$|In 1867, a log dam {{was built}} across the Cottonwood River, and a wooden-frame mill was {{constructed}} for <b>sawing</b> <b>lumber.</b> The following year (1868) it was converted to grind flour and named Cedar Point Mill. In 1870, {{the name was}} changed to Drinkwater & Schriver Mill. In 1871, construction of the current stone structure was started, then completed in 1875. In 1884, the log dam {{was replaced by a}} stone dam.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} board feet, {{the peak of}} the lumber era in Pennsylvania arrived in about 1885, when 1.9 million logs went through the boom at Williamsport. These logs {{produced}} a total of about 226 million board feet (533,000 m3) of <b>sawed</b> <b>lumber.</b> After that, production steadily declined throughout the state. Lock Haven's timber business was also affected by flooding, which badly damaged the canals and destroyed the log boom in 1889.|$|R
5000|$|... "Lengthwise to {{the long}} platform, and resting across the lash poles, ran six-by-six sawed timbers. These formed the {{foundation}} for the low building that was erected on the raft. They were also the support for its plank floor. The building was a plain rectangular hut of <b>sawed</b> <b>lumber</b> nailed lengthwise to upright studding. The roof was not wedged, but rounding, an effect gained by the simple expedient of bending roof boards across in a distinct bow.|$|R

50|$|The American Ranch and Hotel {{was founded}} in 1852 by H.J. Bradley. The {{structure}} has {{the distinction of being}} the first in the area constructed of <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber.</b> It served as the county seat during the founding of Plumas County in 1854.|$|E
50|$|The Royal Navy {{relied heavily}} upon naval stores from American colonies, and naval stores were an {{essential}} part of the colonial economy. Masts came from the large white pines of New England, while pitch came from the longleaf pine forests of Carolina, which also produced <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber,</b> shake shingles, and staves.|$|E
5000|$|Seth spent {{ten years}} {{working in his}} father's mill in Illinois, <b>sawing</b> <b>lumber</b> and {{grinding}} grain. After his father's death in 1839 he sold the mill and tried farming. He married Anna Maria Sharpless, of Catawissa, Pennsylvania, in 1840 and they had five children together: James (1842), Carlin, who is sometimes called Calvin (1846), Austin (1847), Ellen (1849), and Roderick (1851). [...] Anna Maria and two of their sons, James and Austin, died {{during the winter of}} 1852-53, while Seth was in California.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{his return}} to the house, he went around on the valley side, so as to see the place by light of day. His father had built for permanence; and evidently there had been three {{constructive}} periods in the history of that long, substantial, picturesque log house. But few nails and little <b>sawed</b> <b>lumber</b> and no glass had been used. Strong and skillful hands, axes and a crosscut saw, had been the prime factors in erecting this habitation of the Isbels.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] laughed Thorne, [...] "you will {{no doubt}} be consoled to hear that I've come into line. There are now one hundred and sixty acres of virgin prairie {{recorded}} in my name, and I believe a carload of <b>sawed</b> <b>lumber</b> and general fixings will arrive at the station in the next few days. When they do, I'll borrow your wagon and hired man to haul them out, though I'll have to camp in a tent until I get my first crop in." ...|$|R
50|$|Edward and Pasco Adey came to Lee Bight c.1865 from Hant's Harbour {{with the}} {{intention}} of logging. Lee Bight had all of the natural requirements for a logging operation, a nearby timber stand sufficient to support a water powered sawmill from a nearby fast flowing brook and clear access to the sea to ship the <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Graf Bros partakes in two {{practices}} that are unique to the lumber and flooring industries. The first is the production of [...] "Monster Boards", which are boards with width offerings ranging from 9 to 32 inches. The second unique practice is offering sorted or fixed widths in rift and quarter <b>sawn</b> <b>lumber</b> in almost any width the customer wants.|$|E
5000|$|M. K. Dickinson, Esq., {{established}} the Long Island Flouring Mills in 1860, {{which had the}} capacity of grinding one hundred barrels of flour per diem; the buildings were substantially built of stone.

50|$|Also {{known as}} the Williams-Droescher Mill, Droescher's Mill is the last {{remaining}} mill on the Rahway River. It was constructed in 1737 by Benjamin Williams as a saw mill alongside a dam. Williams used {{the flow of the}} river to turn an undershot water wheel to power his <b>saws.</b> <b>Lumber</b> cut here went into the construction of the first houses built in the area. Shortly before his death in 1779, Williams erected a second building only a few feet from his sawmill for the manufacture of woolens.|$|R
