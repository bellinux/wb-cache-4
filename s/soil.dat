50|$|Zinc {{deficiency}} {{is common}} in {{many different types of}} soil; some <b>soils</b> (sandy <b>soils,</b> histosols and <b>soils</b> developed from highly weathered parent material) have low total zinc concentrations, and others have low plant-available zinc due to strong zinc sorption (calcareous <b>soils,</b> highly weathered <b>soils,</b> vertisols, hydromorphic <b>soils,</b> saline <b>soils).</b> <b>Soils</b> low in organic matter (such as where topsoils have been removed), and compacted <b>soils</b> that restrict root proliferation also have a high risk of zinc deficiency. Application of phosphorus fertilizers has frequently been associated with zinc deficiency; {{this may be due to}} enhanced sorption by clay minerals (especially iron oxides), suppression of vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae and/or immobilization of zinc in plant tissues. Liming of <b>soils</b> also frequently induces zinc deficiency by increasing zinc sorption.|$|R

The benefits were increased plant growth, increased phosphorus uptake and <b>soil</b> nitrogen content, higher <b>soil</b> organic matter content, and <b>soil</b> aggregation, attributed to higher legume nodulation {{in the presence of}} AMF, better water infiltration, and <b>soil</b> aeration due to <b>soil</b> aggregation.|$|E
