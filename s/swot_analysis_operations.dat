In strategic management process <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis,</b> which evaluates the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats {{of an organization}} {{is one of the}} most common approaches for analyzing strategic decisions. When used appropriately, <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> can provide a good foundation for strategy formulation. However, <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> has some drawbacks in the measurement and evaluation steps in strategic decision-making process. In conventional <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis,</b> the importance of the factors is not quantified to determine the effect of each factor on the proposed strategy. In other words, <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> does not provide an analytical means to determine the relative importance of the factors, or the ability to assess the appropriateness of decision alternatives based on these factors. While it does pinpoint the factors in the analysis, individual factors are usually described briefly and very generally. For this reason, <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> cannot comprehensively assess the strategic decision-making process.

40|$|Strength, weakness, opportunity, {{and threat}} (<b>SWOT)</b> <b>analysis</b> {{has been in}} use since the 1960 s {{as a tool to}} assist {{strategic}} planning in various types of enterprises including those in the construction industry. While still widely used, the approach has called for improvements to make it more helpful in strategic management. The project described in this paper aimed to study whether the process to convert a <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> into a strategic plan could be assisted with some simple rationally quantitative model, as an augmented <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis.</b> By using the mathematical approaches including the quantifying techniques, the "maximum subarray" method, and fuzzy mathematics, one or more heuristic rules (HRs) are derived from a <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis.</b> These HRs bring into focus the most influential factors concerning a strategic planning situation, and thus inform strategic analysts where particular consideration should be given. A case study conducted in collaboration with a Chinese international construction company showed that the new SWOT approach is more helpful to strategic planners. The paper provides an augmented <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> approach for strategists to conduct strategic planning in the construction industry.

40|$|<b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis,</b> a {{commonly}} used tool for strategic planning, is traditionally {{a form of}} brainstorming.

While most studies of <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> have only focused on solving these shortcomings separately, this study offers an approach to diminish both shortcomings by applying Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) to identify SWOT based on customer satisfaction surveys which produces prioritized SWOT corresponding to the customers’ perception. Through the use of IPA based <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis,</b> it is expected that a organisation can efficiently formulate strategic planning as the SWOT factors that should be maintained or improved can be clearly identified based on customers’ viewpoints.

40|$|Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (<b>SWOT)</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tools for strategic planning. The traditional method of conducting <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> does not prioritize and is likely to hold subjective views that may result in an improper strategic action. Accordingly, this research exploits Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA), a technique for measuring customers’ satisfaction based on survey data, to systematically generate prioritized SWOT factors based on customers’ perspectives which in turn produces more accurate information for strategic planning. This proposed approach is called IPA based <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> and its development issues discussed in this report are: (1) selecting a technique for measuring importance which {{is one of the}} two main aspects of IPA since currently there are no well-established approaches for measuring importance; and (2) identifying opportunities and threats since only strengths and weaknesses can be inferred from the IPA result. The first issue is addressed by conducting an empirical comparison to analyse the performance of various techniques for measuring importance. Specifically, this thesis considers two data mining techniques namely Naïve Bayes and Bayesian Networks for measuring importance and compares their performance with other techniques namely Multiple Linear Regressions, Ordinal Logistic Regression and Back Propagation Neural Networks that have been used to derive the importance from the survey data. The comparison result measured against the evaluation metrics suggests that Multiple Linear Regressions is the most suitable technique for measuring importance. Regarding the second issue, opportunities and threats were identified by comparing the IPA result of the target organisation with that of its competitor. Through the use of IPA based <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis,</b> it is expected that an organisation can efficiently formulate strategic planning as the SWOT factors that should be maintained or improved can be clearly identified based on customers’ viewpoints. The application of the IPA based <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> was illustrated and evaluated through a case study of Higher Education Institutions in Thailand. The evaluation results showed that <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> of the case study has a high face validity and its quality is considered acceptable, thereby demonstrating the validity of this study. Although the application of IPA based <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> was illustrated in the specific field, it can be argued that IPA based <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> can be used widely in the other business areas where <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> has been seen to be applicable and the customer satisfaction surveys are generally conducted. <br/...|$|R
