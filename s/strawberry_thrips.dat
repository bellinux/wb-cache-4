25|$|Around 200 {{species of}} pests {{are known to}} attack {{strawberries}} both directly and indirectly. These pests include slugs, moths, fruit flies, chafers, strawberry root weevils, <b>strawberry</b> <b>thrips,</b> strawberry sap beetles, strawberry crown moth, mites, aphids, and others. The caterpillars {{of a number of}} species of Lepidoptera feed on strawberry plants.|$|E
40|$|Strawberry is a {{new crop}} in Indonesia, {{and it has been}} {{developed}} because of its high demands. Thrips is one of the strawberry pest that can reduce quality and quantity strawberry productions. The research was conducted in Alamendah-Rancabali Village, Bandung District from March to August 2012. Thrips species that attack strawberry in Alamendah Village dominated by Frankliniella intonsa (Trybom). Other thrips that were found on plants surround <b>strawberry</b> field is <b>Thrips</b> palmi and Microcephalothrips abdominalis. Both of these thrips are found on tomatoes, potatoes, leek, blackberries, weeds (Amaranthus sp. and Ageratum haustonianum). The complete stadia of F. intonsa were found on strawberry flowers. Population densities in the field were found to be between 1. 8 to 2. 3 individual/flower. Around 68. 4 %- 82. 2 % of the fields are are infested with F. intonsa. Based on test of F. intonsa attack ability on strawberry plant, the result shows 43 % of fruit that harvested is malformed on tips of fruits. Therefore, F. intonsa is potential to become a important pest of strawberry plant...|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{estimate of}} a population is essential for pest management. For Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) in <b>strawberry,</b> counts of <b>thrips</b> in flowers are commonly used {{as there is a}} strong correlation between thrips number per flower and fruit damage. The aim {{of this study was to}} look at the abundance and population structure of thrips within different flower stages and positions on the plant to test whether these affect population estimates. Adult females were found in open buds (petals showing), but were most frequent in young and mature flowers, whereas adult males were not found in buds and were most frequent in mature and senescent flowers. Twice as many adult thrips were found in mature flowers at the top of the plant compared to those at the side. Only larvae were found in closed buds (no petals showing). Larval numbers increased gradually with flower stage and peaked in senescent flowers. Numbers of adults and larvae declined after flowering. Total numbers of thrips and the ratios of females:males and of adults:larvae varied systematically with flower stage. The choice of flower stage and position for sampling could affect population estimates by as much as a factor of four...|$|R
