Simulations were carried out using different configurations of fuzzy controllers and split range combinations for regulatory control. The performance of these control systems were compared using conventional integral of error criteria, the demand of utilities and the control effort. The proposed control system proved able to adequately regulate the temperature in all the tests. Besides, considering a similar ITAE index and using the energetically most efficient split range configuration, fuzzy-PI controller provided a reduction of approximately 84. 5 % in the control effort and of 6. 75 % in total demand of utilities by comparison to a conventional PI controller...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} the PID {{control of a}} batch polymerization reactor concluding after comparison of two different mode of control. The main objective of any control system is to attain target value within minimum time. To achieve this goal we compared <b>split</b> <b>range</b> <b>control</b> with controller using heat load as manipulative variable. Both provide good control but after study of performance index we found PID controller with heat load as manipulative variable performs better than split range controller. Mathematical model: Evolution of particle size distribution is mathematically explained by population balance equations. The model used is Zero- One model as taken from literature. The particle size population is divided into a population containing one and zero radical. This population balance equation can be solved by using orthogonal collocation method. These equations given below are derived from general population balance equation...|$|E

30|$|The polymer {{waveguide}} optical biosensor {{based on}} the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) by using spectral splitting effect is investigated. The MZI based biosensor has two unequal width sensing arms. With the different mode dispersion responses of the two-arm waveguides to the cladding refractive index change, the spectral splitting effect of the output interference spectrum is obtained, inducing a very high sensitivity. The influence of the different mode dispersions between the two-arm waveguides on the spectral splitting characteristic is analyzed. By choosing different lengths of the two unequal width sensing arms, the initial dip wavelength of the interference spectrum and the spectral <b>splitting</b> <b>range</b> can be <b>controlled</b> flexibly. The polymer waveguide optical biosensor is designed, and its sensing property is analyzed. The {{results show that the}} sensitivity of the polymer waveguide optical biosensor by using spectral splitting effect is as high as 104 nm/RIU, with an improvement of 2 – 3 orders of magnitude compared with the slot waveguide based microring biosensor.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new optimization technique that uses empty delay slots to improve code scheduling. We {{are able to}} <b>split</b> live <b>ranges</b> for free, by inserting spill code into empty delay slots. <b>Splitting</b> a live <b>range</b> can reduce interferences with other live ranges and can sometimes free registers. Live ranges no longer interfering with the <b>split</b> live <b>range</b> can sometimes {{make use of the}} extra register. Our algorithm, as a final pass over the code, exploits empty delay slots that would remain unused if spill code was not inserted.

40|$|A {{linear model}} of an {{annealing}} furnace is developed using a black-box system identification approach, and used when testing three different control strategies to improve temperature control. The {{purpose of the}} investigation was {{to see if it}} was possible to improve the temperature control while at the same time  decrease the switching frequency of the  burners. This will lead to a more efficient process as well as less maintenance, which has both economic and environmental benefits. The estimated model has been used to simulate the furnace with both the existing controller and possible new controllers such as a <b>split</b> <b>range</b> controller and a model predictive controller (MPC). A <b>split</b> <b>range</b> controller is a control strategy which can be used when more than one control signal affect the output signal, and the control signals have different range. The main advantage with MPC is that it can take limitations and constraints into account for the controlled process, and with the use of integer programming, explicitly account for the discrete switching behavior of the burners. In simulation both new controllers succeed in decreasing the switching and the MPC also improved the temperature control. This suggest that the control of the furnace can be improved by implementing one of the evaluated controllers...|$|R

DARC improves the packet delivery ratio by a factor of 9 at the maximum for sparse networks while it maintains the increased network capacity for dense networks.

In this <b>range</b> <b>control</b> surface deformation method, three interpolating approaches are proposed to smooth out the changes between the characteristic vertex and fixed vertices.
