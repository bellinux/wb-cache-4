30|$|Given the {{importance}} of antecedent climate in determining fire danger, we used the cross-correlation function (Venables and Ripley 2002) to examine synchronous and lagged correlations between SCPDSI and multiple broad scale <b>synoptic</b> <b>patterns,</b> including the North American Monsoon, El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies.

Wise (2010) describes a ‘Precipitation Dipole Transition Zone.’ This transition zone lies between two regions (the southwestern US and Pacific Northwest) that are highly affected by these larger patterns, but in opposite directions.

40|$|Meteorological {{conditions}} {{within the}} {{planetary boundary layer}} (PBL) are closely governed by large-scale <b>synoptic</b> <b>patterns</b> and play important roles in air quality by directly and indirectly affecting the emission, transport, formation, and deposition of air pollutants. Partly {{due to the lack}} of long-term fine-resolution observations of the PBL, the relationships between <b>synoptic</b> <b>patterns,</b> PBL structure, and aerosol pollution in Beijing have not been well understood. This study applied the obliquely rotated principal component analysis in T-mode to classify the summertime synoptic conditions over Beijing using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis from 2011 to 2014, and investigated their relationships with PBL structure and aerosol pollution by combining numerical simulations, measurements of surface meteorological variables, fine-resolution soundings, the concentration of particles with diameters less than or equal to 2. 5  µm, total cloud cover (CLD), and reanalysis data. Among the seven identified <b>synoptic</b> <b>patterns,</b> three types accounted for 67  % of the total number of cases studied and were associated with heavy aerosol pollution events. These particular <b>synoptic</b> <b>patterns</b> were characterized by high-pressure systems located to the east or southeast of Beijing at the 925  hPa level, which blocked the air flow seaward, and southerly PBL winds that brought in polluted air from the southern industrial zone. The horizontal transport of pollutants induced by the synoptic forcings may be the most important factor affecting the air quality of Beijing in summer. In the vertical dimension, these three <b>synoptic</b> <b>patterns</b> featured a relatively low boundary layer height (BLH) in the afternoon, accompanied by high CLD and southerly cold advection from the seas within the PBL. The high CLD reduced the solar radiation reaching the surface, and suppressed the thermal turbulence, leading to lower BLH. Besides, the numerical sensitive experiments show that cold advection induced by the large-scale synoptic forcing may have cooled the PBL, leading to an increase in near-surface stability and a decrease in the BLH in the afternoon. Moreover, when warm advection appeared simultaneously above the top level of the PBL, the thermal inversion layer capping the PBL may have been strengthened, resulting in the further suppression of PBL and thus the deterioration of aerosol pollution levels. This study has important implications for understanding the crucial roles that meteorological factors (at both synoptic and local scales) play in modulating and forecasting aerosol pollution in Beijing and its surrounding area...|$|R

50|$|On April 20, meteorologists at the Storm Prediction Center {{noted that}} a {{significant}} change in the large-scale <b>synoptic</b> <b>pattern</b> across the United States would allow for a trough to move inland over the Northwestern United States. They noted the possibility of isolated severe thunderstorms across the Rocky Mountain Foothills. This system moved into the region two days later and prompted the issuance of a slight-risk around the Yellowstone National Park region in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Ahead of the trough, upper-level cooling above modest surface heating enhanced low-level lapse rates and allowed for scattered severe storms. Due to a lack of significant moisture, with dew points in the area only at 30 F, activity was constrained. A severe thunderstorm watch was issued for the region by 2:30 p.m. MDT (2030 UTC) as a cold front associated with the trough moved through. Straight-line winds up to 66 mph occurred in the area. Further south, a gust of 72 mph was measured in northwest of Wild Horse, Colorado during a downburst.

The influence of large-scale climate modes on the frequency and timing of the regional <b>synoptic</b> <b>patterns</b> is also investigated.

Given the much colder air aloft (freezing levels near 700 hPa) coupled with surface heating there was the risk for small hail and gusty outflow winds, which was also mentioned.

Two different situations have been detected as being responsible for an EHD occurrence, one more dynamical, produced by southern fluxes, and another associated with a stagnation situation over Iberia of a longer duration. Both account for 92...|$|R
40|$|At {{temperate}} latitudes the <b>synoptic</b> <b>patterns</b> of {{bird migration}} are strongly structured {{by the presence}} of cyclones and anticyclones, both in the horizontal and altitudinal dimensions. In certain synoptic conditions, birds may efficiently cross regions with opposing surface wind by choosing a higher flight altitude with more favourable wind. We observed migratory passerines at mid-latitudes that selected high altitude wind optima on particular nights, leading to the formation of structured migration layers at varying altitude up to 3 km. Using long-term vertical profiling of bird migration by C-band Doppler radar in the Netherlands, we find that such migration layers occur nearly exclusively during spring migration {{in the presence of a}} high-pressure system. A conceptual analytic framework providing insight into the <b>synoptic</b> <b>patterns</b> of wind assistance for migrants that includes the altitudinal dimension has so far been lacking. We present a simple model for a baroclinic atmosphere that relates vertical profiles of wind assistance to the pressure and temperature patterns occurring at temperate latitudes. We show how the magnitude and direction of the large scale horizontal temperature gradient affects the relative gain in wind assistance that migrants obtain through ascending. Temperature gradients typical for northerly high-pressure systems in spring are shown to cause high altitude wind optima in the easterly sectors of anticyclones, thereby explaining the frequent observations of high altitude migration in these synoptic conditions. Given the recurring synoptic arrangements of pressure systems across temperate continents, the opportunities for exploiting high altitude win...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} a 15 -year climatological study of severe weather events and related severe weather atmospheric parameters. Data sources included local forecast rules, archived sounding data, Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Surveillance System (CGLSS) data, surface and upper air maps, and two severe weather event databases covering east-central Florida. The local forecast rules {{were used to}} set threat assessment thresholds for stability parameters that were derived from the sounding data. The severe weather events databases were used to identify days with reported severe weather and the CGLSS data was used to differentiate between lightning and non-lightning days. These data sets provided the foundation for analyzing the stability parameters and <b>synoptic</b> <b>patterns</b> {{that were used to}} develop an objective tool to aid in forecasting severe weather events. The period of record for the analysis was May - September, 1989 - 2003. The results indicate that there are certain <b>synoptic</b> <b>patterns</b> more prevalent on days with severe weather and some of the stability parameters are better predictors of severe weather days based on locally tuned threat values. The results also revealed the stability parameters that did not display any skill related to severe weather days. An interactive web-based Severe Weather Decision Aid was developed to assist the duty forecaster by providing a level of objective guidance based on the analysis of the stability parameters, CGLSS data, and synoptic-scale dynamics. The tool will be tested and evaluated during the 2005 warm season...|$|R
