5000|$|An {{optional}} heading containing control information can precede {{data in a}} frame. The content of the heading is not defined by the protocol but is defined for each specific device. The heading, if present, is preceded by an SOH (<b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>heading)</b> <b>character</b> and followed by an STX (start of text). [...] Text data normally follows the heading, begun by the STX, and terminated by ETX (end of text) or ETB (end transmission block).|$|E
50|$|The <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>heading</b> (SOH) <b>character</b> was to mark a non-data {{section of}} a data stream—the part of a stream {{containing}} addresses and other housekeeping data. The <b>start</b> <b>of</b> text character (STX) {{marked the end of}} the header, and the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the textual part of a stream. The end of text character (ETX) marked the end of the data of a message. A widely used convention is to make the two characters preceding ETX a checksum or CRC for error-detection purposes. The end of transmission block character (ETB) was used to indicate the end of a block of data, where data was divided into such blocks for transmission purposes.|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of computer and network technology, the study of metadata and the standards of metadata have become key research topics in recent years. Metadata design gives us a good tool to help with lexicography. Though it is indispensable for the external metadata of dictionaries, internal metadata design for entry content is even more important. Among these designs, those metadata for <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>character</b> and headwords are still the basic work. These designs provide basic linguistic material and support finishing the work remaining in dictionary compilation. This paper describes a set <b>of</b> metadata <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>character</b> and headwords with the reference to the Temporary Chinese Dictionary...|$|R
40|$|Due to late {{planting}} the panicle initiation, <b>heading</b> and maturity <b>of</b> all the cultivars were slowed with decreasing air temperature and solar radiation. Nizersail and BR 11 {{did not complete}} flower beyond October 01 and September 01 planting, respectively while BR 11 completed flowering in all the planting dates. An average temperature 23. 92, 26. 17 and 21. 31 �C for 10 days after <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>heading</b> was required for Nizersail, BR 11 and BR 22, respectively. Eighty three to 94 % tillers of Nizersail produced fully exserted panicles upto October 01 planting while for BR 11 it was 21 - 92 % upto September 15 planting but in BR 22 it was about 86 - 97 % in all planting dates. Full panicle exsertion of Nizersail sharply increased with increasing temperature sum for 10 days from <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>heading,</b> later slightly decreased but it was sharply increased in BR 11. The BR 22 was less sensitive to temperature. The percent panicle exsertion was highly correlated with temperature sum for 1 - 10 days after <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>heading</b> for Nizersail (r = 0. 87 **) and BR 22 (r = 0. 96 **). In BR 11, it was highly correlated with temperature sum for 1 - 10, 11 - 20, 21 - 30 and 11 - 30, days from <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>heading</b> and the corresponding values were (r = 0. 97 **), (r = 0. 95 **), (r = 0. 81 *), (r = 0. 90 **), respectively...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{large-scale}} molecular attempts, {{the relationships}} of the basal winged insect lineages dragonflies, mayflies and neopterans, are still unresolved. Other data sources, such as morphology, suffer from unclear functional dependencies of the structures considered, which might mislead phylogenetic inference. Here, we assess this problem by combining {{for the first time}} biomechanics with phylogenetics using two advanced engineering techniques, multibody dynamics analysis and finite-element analysis, to objectively identify functional linkages in insect head structures which have been used traditionally to argue basal winged insect relationships. With a biomechanical model of unprecedented detail, we are able to investigate the mechanics of morphological characters under biologically realistic load, i. e. biting. We show that a range <b>of</b> <b>head</b> <b>characters,</b> mainly ridges, endoskeletal elements and joints, are indeed mechanically linked to each other. An analysis of character state correlation in a morphological data matrix focused on <b>head</b> <b>characters</b> shows highly significant correlation of these mechanically linked structures. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction under different data exclusion schemes based on the correlation analysis unambiguously supports a sistergroup relationship of dragonflies and mayflies. The combination of biomechanics and phylogenetics as it is proposed here could be a promising approach to assess functional dependencies in many organisms to increase our understanding of phenotypic evolution...|$|R
