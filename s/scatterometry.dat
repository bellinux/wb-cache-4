40|$|With {{shrinkage}} of device size, metrology {{requirements for}} Critical Dimension (CD), as {{defined as the}} ratio of precision of metrology to process tolerance (P/T), must meet the 0. 1 (10 %) or 0. 2 (20 %) criterion. [1][2][14] The precision requirement for gate CD at the 90 nm node is thus ~ 0. 3 nm or less with P/T of 10 %, which is far beyond what traditional CD metrology can achieve today. At future nodes, this requirement becomes even tougher, even with P/T of 20 %. For years, <b>scatterometry</b> has demonstrated its capability to determine CD and cross sectional profile over periodically aligned line and space (i. e. grating) structures with superior precision. However, to gauge the true capability of <b>scatterometry</b> for process monitoring, the concept of Total Measurement Uncertainty (TMU) [11] of <b>scatterometry</b> in reference to CD-SEM and CD-AFM should be implemented since TMU comprehends both precision and accuracy relative to a reference measurement system.

40|$|Abstract—Scatterometry {{is one of}} the few {{metrology}} {{candidates that}} has true in situ/in-line potential for deep submicrometer critical dimension (CD) and profile analysis. Most existing scat-terometers are designed to measure multiple incident angles at a single wavelength on periodic gratings. We extend this idea by deploying specular spectroscopic <b>scatterometry.</b> Specular spectroscopic <b>scatterometry</b> (SSS) is designed to measure the zeroth-order diffraction response at a fixed angle of incidence and multiple wavelengths. This mechanism allows the use of existing thin-film metrology equipment, such as spectroscopic el-lipsometers, to accurately extract topographic profile information from one-dimensional (1 -D) periodic structures. In this work, we developed the grating tool-kit (gtk), which implements several variants of rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) to accurately and efficiently simulate diffraction behavior of 1 -D gratings. Theoretical simulations using this package show that specular spectroscopic <b>scatterometry</b> can be applied in the current semi-conductor manufacturing technology, and can be easily extended to the 0. 07 - m generation. We have also applied a library-based profile extraction methodology to resist and poly focus-exposure matrices patterned using 0. 25 - and 0. 18 - m lithography and etch technology, respectively, to extract their cross-sectional profiles. Discrepancies between CD-SEM, CD-AFM, and SSS measurements are discussed and explained.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} <b>scatterometry</b> {{problems}} arising in lithography production of periodic gratings. Namely, the paper introduces a theoretical and numerical-modeling-oriented approach to <b>scatterometry</b> problems and discusses its capabilities. The approach allows for reliable detection of deviations in gratings' critical dimensions (CDs) during the manufacturing process. The {{core of the}} approach is the one-to-one correspondence between the electromagnetic (EM) characteristics and the geometric/material properties of gratings. The approach is based on highly accurate solutions of initial boundary-value problems describing EM waves' interaction on periodic gratings.

40|$|<b>Scatterometry</b> {{is a new}} optical {{technique}} for profile measurement, capable of providing 2 or 3 dimensional profile information. The <b>scatterometry</b> optical system can be made small and economic enough to enable integration into each production tool and is therefore ideally suited for integrated process control. In addition, the range of applications for which this method applicable is wide: Lithography photoresist profiles, Etch structures, and even measurements of transparent layer thickness above arrays after CVD or CMP steps. <b>Scatterometry</b> {{is based on the}} measurement of the optical diffraction characteristics of a periodic structure. Interpretation is done by evaluating the expected spectrum for a given profile, comparing the result to the measurement, and continuously fitting the profile parameters until a best fit is achieved. The leading physical model used in <b>scatterometry</b> is the Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis (RCWA). It is based on dissecting the profile into several layers and treating each as a waveguide with a fixed cross-section. The accuracy of the model is determined by the resolution of the dissection (number oflayers), and the number of Fourier modes retained in the calculation. RCWA gives very accurate results provided sufficient number of modes and layers are used. As calculation time scales linearly with number oflayers and roughly cubic with number of modes, this usually leads to long calculation time, thus inhibiting real time interpretation which is especially required for integrated metrology...|$|E

In this thesis, immersion <b>scatterometry</b> is investigated to improve feature resolution for nanoscale surface-relief gratings.

Additional propagating reflected modes create the potential for more features in the specular-mode ellipsometric spectrum, which can convey additional information about the sample under investigation. Initial experimental results for immersion ellipsometry and topography extraction of gratings are reported. Potential sources of systematic error in immersion ellipsometry are investigated. The effects of these error sources are quantified, and mitigation strategies are evaluated. These strategies should also aid in reducing errors in other applications of immersion ellipsometry, including electrochemistry, biology, and medicine...|$|E

In spectroscopy and <b>scatterometry</b> material structures can be measured and modeled from the atomic (binding configurations, electronic band structure) through nanometer (nanocrystals, long range order) to micron scales (photonic structures, gratings, critical dimension measurements). Using optical techniques, atomic scale structures, morphology, crystallinity, doping and a range of other properties that can be related to the changes of the electronic band structure can most sensitively be measured for materials having interband transition energies in the optical photon energy range. This will be demonstrated by different models for the dielectric function of ZnO, a key material in optoelectronics and in numerous other fields. Using polarimetry such as spectroscopic ellipsometry, sub-nanometer precision has long been revealed for the thickness of optical quality layers.
