30|$|Several {{hardware}} {{changes in}} the conventional MPT systems have been proposed to enhance noise signal immunity to a minimum level. The use of an oscillating <b>shear</b> <b>valve</b> instead of rotational valve capable of generating pressure pulses at the appropriate frequency for the well conditions {{and the use of}} two surface pressure transducers on the surface have been tested (Klotz et al. 2008 a, b, c). Surface noise cancellation algorithms in real-time to handle complex and continuously varying properties of the transmission mud channel to optimize signal transmission were implemented, as shown in Fig.  2. The developed MPT system was robust in the presence of surface piping, borehole drilling parameters and mud changing properties (Klotz et al. 2008 b). The new mud pulse telemetry system using the annular-venting pulsar technology to create negative pressure pulses in the borehole of the drill string was demonstrated by (Cooper et al. 2015). The system objective was to improve downhole power management, actuation of the valve, and valve durability, thereby increasing the strength and data rate of the system.|$|E
40|$|Magneto{{rheological}} (MR) fluids possess rheological properties, {{which can}} be changed in a controlled way. These rheological changes are reversible and dependent {{on the strength of}} an excitation magnetic field. MR fluids have potentially beneficial applications when placed in various applied loading (<b>shear,</b> <b>valve</b> and squeeze) modes. The squeeze mode is a geometric arrangement where an MR fluid is sandwiched between two flat parallel solid surfaces facing each other. The distance between these two parallel surfaces is called the gap size. These surfaces are either pushed towards or pulled apart from each other by orthogonal magnetic-induced forces. In this study, a test rig was designed and built to perform the experiments with three different types of MR fluids. One type of water-based and two types of hydrocarbon-based MR fluids were activated by a magnetic field generated by a coil using different magnitudes of DC electrical current. To finalize the design, a Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) was used to predict the magnetic field strength throughout the MR fluids. For each trial, combination of three process parameters were experimented in both compression and tension modes on each type of MR fluid. The three process parameters were the electric current applied to the coil, the initial gap size and the compressive or tensile speed. In every test, the speed and the current in the coil were kept constant, while the instantaneous compressive and tensile forces were recorded. Experimental results showed that MR fluids have distinct unique behaviour during the compression and tension processes. The behaviour of MR fluids was dependent on the relative movement between the solid magnetic particles and the carrier fluid in both squeeze modes. A high ratio of solid particles to carrier liquid in the MR fluid is an indication of high magnetic properties. The water-based MR fluid had a relatively large solids-to-liquid ratio. At a given applied current, significant increases in compressive and tensile stresses were obtained in this fluid type. On the other hand, the hydrocarbon-based MR fluids had relatively lower solids-to-liquid ratios, whereby, less significant increases in compressive and tensile stresses were obtained. The magnetic field strength was proportional to the applied current. Consequently, the MR effect, in terms of resulting stresses, was directly proportional to the current. When plotting stress against strain for each experiment, the slopes of the curves were found to be larger in general when the initial gap sizes were smaller. This was due to higher magnetic fields generated in smaller initial gap sizes. However, the stress-strain relationships were slightly affected by changing the compressive or tensile speeds. In general, the compressive stresses were much higher than the tensile stresses for the same experimental parameters throughout this study...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental technologyOnshore and {{offshore}} facilities produce {{oil and gas}} worldwide. Globally, the daily oil production reached 83. 6 {{million barrels per day}} in 2011. During the following years the production has continued increasing. It was estimated that the amount of water produced were over 210 million barrels per day in 1999. Thereby averagely in a global aspect 3 barrels of water had to be produced per barrel of oil. In 2005, 67 - 72 % of all oil produced was produced from mature fields, also called brown fields. These brown fields were believed to hold the majority of the oil resources and production capacity. All produced water should be treated before it is discharged or re-injected to a reservoir. The level, of which the produced water has to be cleaned before discharge, depends on the regions environmental regulations. At the Norwegian continental shelf environmental regulations for discharged produced water are determined by the Norwegian Environmental Ministry and OSPAR. OSPAR has an average minimum demand that OiW (oil in water) concentration shall be less than 30 ppm in average, and a maximum discharge can be 49 ppm. The Norwegian Environmental Ministry has stricter environmental demands, requiring further reduction of both OiW and hazardous components. Produced water treatment is usually carried out in different steps that use different enhanced separation techniques. Statoil ASA has an internal demand that a produced water treatment system shall always have two or more different separation enhancing techniques, to make it more resistant for system upsets. The most standard setup is to have hydrocyclones downstream the main separators that use enhanced gravitational separation and some kind of flotation unit downstream the hydrocyclones. A flotation unit increase separation by enhancing the density difference between oil and water. Typhonix, a local company in the Stavanger region, has developed a low <b>shear</b> <b>valve</b> that has a positive effect on separation systems compared to standard valves. For the produced water, benefits by using typhoon valve have been observed to be a reduction of OiW. Other potential benefits are assumed to be reduction in WiO (water in oil), less need for production chemicals and generally better separation performance in downstream equipment. Most of the typhoon valve test data has been obtained at laboratory conditions. In 2011 the valve was tested with real conditions and compared with a standard valve at Oseberg C. Positive results were also provided from the Oseberg C test.   In this report a case study of Oseberg C will be carried out. The objective will be to reveal if there will be overall benefits on the platform if all choke valves were replaced by typhoon valves. The study will be based on the typhoon valve pilot test at Oseberg C, other typhoon tests, theory about process units and consulting with process personnel from several oil companies. Some conclusions about the process system on Oseberg C have been made: •	The main gravity separators efficiency is increased when typhoon valve is installed compared to when a standard valve is installed. Increase in efficiency was observed as a reduction in OiW concentration by 55 %. •	Hydrocyclone relative efficiency has been proven to be independent of feed OiW concentration as long as the droplet size is the same. •	Degasser relative efficiency has been proven to have some reduced performance when OiW concentration is reduced. The relative efficiency reduction increase when the amounts of OiW reduction increase. A theoretical case study has been carried out on the platform to find what the total effect by changing standard valves with typhoon valves would be. This was done by using the knowledge obtained about the process system at Oseberg C and the reaction the system would have on an OiW reduction of 55 %. The conclusions from the case study are: •	In this case a 55 % reduction of OiW out of the separators will cause the OiW concentrations at the discharge point to be reduced by 55 %. Causing oil discharged to sea to be reduced from 7. 70 ton to 3. 45 ton per year. •	The reduction of OiW out of the separator has the potential {{to reduce the amount of}} flocculants used by 55 %, because flocculent dosing is dependent on OiW concentration. This reduction is equal to 36. 7 – 110 ton of flocculent. •	The produced water system is believed to have a better buffering capacity for system upsets because the OiW concentration in the discharged water is generally lower. •	The positive effects from the typhoon valves are believed to be lowest at 50 % water-cut. From valve tests conducted before this work, the benefits by applying a typhoon valve have increased when water-cuts were different from 50 %. During the pilot test at Oseberg C the water-cut were close to 50 %. Considering this, the typhoon valve is assumed to at least perform according to the results obtained in this work. 2015 - 06 - 1...|$|E

40|$|Primary and {{secondary}} oil depletion only recovers 20 – 50 % original oil in place (OOIP), so {{large amount of}} oil is still trapped in the reservoir after conventional processes. To recover more oil, tertiary methods are used {{to increase the amount}} of oil that can be extracted from an oil field. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is a tertiary method used to maximize oil recovery from the reservoirs. There are many different EOR methods, however, polymer injection and polymer flooding is the most important chemical EOR method used in sandstone reservoirs. It has been found that polymer flooding can recover from 2 – 5 % OOIP over traditional water flooding. Polymers are long chain molecules, often, with high molecular weight. These molecules increase the viscosity of the injection water and improve the mobility ratio, which is the mobility of the displacing phase divided by the mobility of the displaced phase. A mobility ratio of 1 between water and oil will increase the sweep efficiency. However, one of the main problems with polymer flooding is that polymers are very shear sensitive. During polymer injection, shear is especially to be found in process equipment, like fluid flow devices (valves, pumps), but also in the reservoir. When polymers are subjected to shear, they are readily broken down and degraded, which results in irreversible loss of viscosity and inefficient oil recovery. There are however low shear technologies and equipment which purpose is to reduce mechanical degradation of polymers during injection. Some of the state of the art low shear techniques rely on pipes and coils, while other relies on cyclonic principles. It is thought, that a reduction in pressure drop over a longer length (spiral) or in a bigger volume (cyclonic) will reduce shear forces, hence mechanical degradation of polymers. This thesis consists of and is part of two industry projects, a pre-project and a main project between Typhonix, Total and the International Research institute of Stavanger (IRIS) and the Research Council of Norway. The aim of the pre-project and the ongoing main project is to study mechanical degradation of polymers by low shear valves and fluid flow devices, especially low shear Typhoon technologies. Typhonix AS, which is a company with knowledge within low shear process equipment, have patented a cyclonic low <b>shear</b> <b>valve,</b> the Typhoon Valve, and a low shear spiral fluid flow control device, the Shark. Both devices have proven to have a positive effect on oil in water emulsions, due to less shear forces and turbulence. In the Typhoon Valve, the pressure drop is reduced in a bigger volume than in a conventional valve, while in the Shark, the pressure drop is reduced over a longer length, resulting in less shear forces and turbulence. From previous study, it is to believe that a new low shear process for EOR polymer flooding can increase the recovery rate from 3 to 7 %. The Typhoon Valve was tested at Total’s division for polymer injection in Lacq, France (PERL). The Shark was tested at Typhonix’s own laboratory at Varhaug, together with a small scale Typhoon Valve and a standard valve. In both test programs, a high concentration polymer solution was pumped through a test-rig where the Typhoon Valve (France) or the Shark, small scale Typhoon Valve or standard valve were installed (Varhaug), at different flow rates and pressure drops. Different configurations of the Shark were tested, to see if different lengths and diameters had influence on polymer degradation. Samples were taken downstream the test-section, and the viscosity of the samples was measured with a rheometer. % degradation was then calculated, and the Typhoon Valve, the Shark, and the Typhoon configuration were compared to the results with the Standard valve. The testing in France with the 2 ” Typhoon Valve did not give the positive results that were expected. It was observed that the degradation with the Typhoon Valve was in the same range as with the Standard Valve. It was also seen that the degradation was a function of both pressure drop and flow rate, as they increased, the degradation also increased. Especially with high pressure drop was % degradation in both valves was high (> 60 %). It was found that the internals in the Typhoon Valve was not optimized for the test conditions, so this may be the reason for the disappointing results. However, the testing at Varhaug with the different Shark configurations, gave very promising results. It was not observed any degradation of the solution, with any of the different cones and spirals, even at the highest pressure drop, and % degradation remained low. It was seen that the shear rates in the cones and spiral were less than the critical shear rate of the polymer. The viscosity did differ a little at very low shear rates when viscosity measurements were conducted, but this can be explained by high uncertainties and sound at low shear rates. Also, with the Typhoon configuration, the results were promising. It was observed that the valve gave less degradation of the polymer solution compared to a standard valve, especially at high pressure drops, and % degradation was lower than with the standard valve. The experiments conduced, both in France and at Varhaug, gave knowledge about shear rates and shear degradation of polymer solutions in mechanical facilities. From the results further suggestions and further tests are planed to be conducted, for both the Typhoon Valve and the Shark. The Typhoon Valve are planed to be tested with new internals, such that optimized capacity is achieved. This testing is going to take place at Total’s facilties in Lacq in autumn 2013.

40|$|The {{essential}} {{characteristic of}} controllable fluids is {{their ability to}} change their rheological behaviour under an electrical field. These materials are referred as Electro-Rheological (ER) fluids. An ER fluid {{is a mixture of}} a base fluid, usually some type insulating liquid such as mineral or silicone oil, with suspension particles, such as cornstarch, zeolite, glass bead or cellulose. When there is no electric field, particles are randomly suspended in the base liquid. When an electric field is applied, the particles in the fluid form chains bridging the conductors of opposite polarity and turn the liquid into a solid-like gel. The process is seemingly reversible once the electric field is removed. The process takes place within milliseconds. In this thesis, <b>shear</b> and <b>valve</b> modes of operation are considered for one particular ER fluid from a practically oriented design point of view. Chapter 1 provides background information concerning ER fluids and ER devices in practical applications. Chapter 2 describes a prediction tool for the shear mode of operation based on the Bingham model. The prediction model is based on the (solid to liquid) weight fraction, applied electric field and strain rate. An ER clutch with a single disk was designed, and tested to validate the model. In Chapter 3, an ER valve experiment is presented to relate the force-displacement behaviour with varying applied voltage, weight fraction and other operating conditions (volume flow rate, cyclic frequency and stroke length). A new model for an ER damper in fluctuating flow is also presented in Chapter 4. This new model is a modification of the uniform flow Bingham plastic model. Comparison between the predictions from the model and observations from the experiments is also given in Chapter 4.

One of these sub-projects is on control of subsea processes. Control algorithms will be developed and then validated in a small scale laboratory that will include hydrocyclones, a Compact Flotation Unit (CFU), a bulk separator, a coalescing pump and low <b>shear</b> control <b>valves</b> in addition to standard processing equipment. This Master thesis is a part of this sub-project, focusing on the construction of Phase 1 of the Compact Separator Laboratory (CSL). The primary objective of this Master thesis is installing the instrumentation and electrical system of the CSL, designing and configuring a control system and Human Machine Interface (HMI), in addition to leak testing the CSL. Much of the engineering of the CSL have already been done during the specialization project [11]. Work done in this Master thesis is the basis for further development of the CSL. The CSL is to be built in four Phases, and this Master thesis focuses on Phase 1. Facilitation for Phases 2 - 4 during the construction of Phase 1 is a necessity in order to avoid unnecessary extra work later on. For this reason, getting familiar with all Phases both technically and design-wise {{is an essential part of}} the thesis. Since Phase 1 is completed throughout this Master thesis, the uncertainty lies in acquiring or constructing a pump and reservoir system. Options like buying or leasing a pump temporarily prior to the construction of the pump and reservoir system in Phase 3 have been considered, but the best option seems to be to wait for a permanent system. This will make the CSL able to separate oil and water, not just testing the CSL with water...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Magneto-rheological (MR) fluids are {{suspensions}} of micron-sized ferromagnetic {{particles in}} a non-magnetic carrier fluid. The essential characteristic of MR fluid is the rapid and reversible {{transition from the}} state of a Newtonian-like fluid to the behaviour of a stiff semi-solid by applying a magnetic field of ∼ 0. 1 – 0. 4 T. This feature can be understood {{from the fact that the}} particles form chain-like structures aligned in the field direction. The MR fluid offers three modes of operation, namely the direct <b>shear</b> mode, the <b>valve</b> mode, and the squeeze mode. The latter is of particular interest due to its highly non-linear behaviour, which is still not fully understood and therefore expected to give rise to new industrial applications. A test rig for the exploration of the MR-fluid behaviour was designed for experimental purposes. The present article describes the results of measurements under sinusoidal loading modes. Special emphasis was posed on the dependence of the MR-fluid response with respect to parameter variations of the applied static magnetic field, the cyclic loading amplitude, and frequency values. Cavitation effects have been investigated and partially suppressed by pre-pressurizing the MR fluid, which enables a more thorough insight into particle chain disruption and segregation effects. Well-pronounced hys-teresis loops are observed and exhibit characteristic kinks, which cannot be understood withi...|$|R

Although <b>valve</b> anomalies {{have been associated with}} genetic mutations, often the cause is unknown. However, altered haemodynamics have been suggested as a pathogenic contributor to bicuspid aortic valve disease. Conversely, how abnormal haemodynamics impacts mitral valve development is still poorly understood. In order to analyse altered blood flow, the outflow tract of the chick heart was constricted using a ligature to increase cardiac pressure overload. Outflow tract-banding was performed at HH 21, with harvesting at crucial valve development stages (HH 26, HH 29 and HH 35). Although normal valve morphology was found in HH 26 outflow tract banded hearts, smaller and dysmorphic mitral valve primordia were seen upon altered haemodynamics in histological and stereological analysis at HH 29 and HH 35. A decrease in apoptosis, and aberrant expression of a shear stress responsive gene and extracellular matrix markers in the endocardial cushions were seen in the chick HH 29 outflow tract banded hearts. In addition, dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins fibrillin- 2, type III collagen and tenascin were further demonstrated in more mature primordial mitral valve leaflets at HH 35, with a concomitant decrease of ECM cross-linking enzyme, transglutaminase- 2. These data provide compelling evidence that normal haemodynamics are a prerequisite for normal mitral valve morphogenesis, and abnormal blood flow could be a contributing factor in mitral valve defects, with differentiation as a possible underlying mechanism...|$|R

Most of the conventional displacement machines are basically a reciprocating pumping element controlled by valve plates or {{with the help of}} check valve [1]. This kind of hydraulic machines loose efficiency dramatically at partial displacement because all of the pistons remain at high pressure at the cycle time and due to pressure inside the piston leakage and shear losses increases. One approach to improve the efficiency of the displacement machine can be controlling each hydraulic piston by using programmable faster valves called digital valve. As the total displacement will be controlled digitally, the total system is called Digital Displacement Technology. In digital displacement machine it is possible to disconnect some of the pistons from the load and the piston will connect only with the low pressure side, minimizing losses due to leakage and <b>shear.</b> As the <b>valve</b> will control directly with digital controller it will eliminate the necessity of servo-hydraulic control required by conventional systems. Digital valves can open fully and close again with the input signal within one revaluation of the shaft, so it gives better control to the pumping element results reduction in hysteresis and increase the linearity of the pumping element. In Digital Displacement machines by controlling the valves pistons are connected with the machine when pressure is equal, but in the traditional machines piston connection was pre-determined with the shaft angle. By doing the piston control efficiency of the machine will improve and the sound generates for the decompression flow will be reduced [17]. Also energy storage and recovery can be possible by using accumulator...|$|R
40|$|Most of the easily {{accessible}} offshore {{oil and gas}} resources have been developed. As a result of this, subsea production and processing has {{over the last decade}} been regarded as the future of the offshore oil and gas industry. Operators are moving into more complex environments and remote locations. The increased water depths and lower temperatures implies that the existing subsea technology is in constant need of innovation. Through the Center of Innovation-Driven Research (SFI) SUBPRO (Subsea Production and Processing), which is a cooperation between NTNU and several companies in the oil and gas industry, the industry partners expressed an interest in compact separation technology, especially hydrocyclones and Compact Flotation Units (CFUs). Since the large vessels used in conventional subsea separation technology are limited by both hydrostatic pressure and installation complexity, compact separation technology is considered a necessity for operating at greater water depths. Because of their limited volume and short residence time, compact separators are sensitive towards flow irregularities. Flow irregularities are changes in pressure and flow rate that occurs naturally in a well stream, or during start up and shut down of a well. These irregularities can potentially {{have a negative impact on}} separation efficiency. Avoiding or suppressing the effects of these flow irregularities is some of the current challenges in compact separation design. This Master s thesis describes the design of a compact separator laboratory that will facil- itate research on novel control algorithms. The design is based on a multi-stage hydrocyclone system, with three hydrocyclones in series. The laboratory focuses on produced water treat- ment, and aims to meet the governmental regulations for disposal of produced water to the sea. By developing new aspects in control theory, the control algorithms aim to solve the problems related to flow irregularities in compact separation. As a result, the design includes several fast acting control valves, pressure- and temperature transmitters, and flow meters to provide a continuous real time overview of the system. Oil-in-Water (OiW) sensors are in- cluded to monitor the OiW concentration, and act as an input to the control system. Low <b>shear</b> control <b>valves</b> are also included in order to compare the impact on separation efficiency with conventional control valves. The compact separator laboratory is designed and constructed through four individual phases. An additional phase, containing a feeding and reservoir system, has also been de- signed. The phases are implemented based on the experience and requirements of the previous phase/phases. The last of the four phases focuses on future solutions, and is not implemented in the budget. The main focus of this thesis is the specific design of Phase 1, but in order to account for future expansions and increased flexibility, Phase 2, 3 and 4 are included in the design. Technical future proofing is applied in the design of Phase 1 to ease the implementation of the later phases. Phase 1 will be connected to a Cameron feeding system, with both a gravity separator and oil- and water pumps. Phase 1 is designed with EX certified components to allow testing with crude oils, which increases the credibility of the results. The additional phase, a reservoir and a feeding pump system, are designed in detail to allow fast implementation if the Cameron feeding system proves to be disadvantageous for the separation results. The total budget for the design, construction and operation of the compact separator lab- oratory is NOK 3, 000, 000. The proposed design is within the budget and has an economical safety factor of 1. 50 %. The health, environment and safety aspects has influenced the entire design process, and all chosen process equipment has a safety factor of 1. 6 with respect to operating pressure. A NTNU standard risk assessment have been conducted...|$|R
