5|$|The most {{important}} factor that negatively affects maintenance is the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft and sale of <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> and even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries. When not stealing <b>spare</b> <b>parts</b> and equipment, maintenance personnel often spend {{the better part of}} their duty day looking for other ways to profit.

Variation in <b>spare</b> <b>part,</b> <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> 2 ̆ 7 s life service, and {{procurement lead time}} tend to increase number of <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> request. On the other hand, huge number of inventories has no direct correlation with plant availability {{as the fact that}} many break-down equipment need extended repair time due to unavailable <b>spare</b> <b>part.</b> Inventory also became main topic on company performance especially on financial side. This paper will discuss <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> procurement method on Steel Making Plant that projected able to maintain and increase Plant Availability and concern to inventory level. The working method started by <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> classification, inventory policy for each <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> classification, and procurement method. <b>Spare</b> <b>part</b> classification according to three mains criteria, which are: USAge value, critically, and USAge frequency. <b>Spare</b> <b>part</b> will divide by 27 different classes to decide inventory policy. These are three inventory policies: with-out stock, one piece stock, and more pieces stock. <b>Spare</b> <b>part</b> procurement method should able to support defined inventory policy and concern to vendor availability.

40|$|We {{consider}} combined {{inventory control}} and throughput time reduction in multi-echelon, multi-indenture <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> networks for system upkeep of capital goods. We construct {{a model in}} which standard throughput times (TPTs) for repair and transportation can be reduced at additional costs. We first estimate the marginal impact of TPT reduction on the system availability. Next, we develop an optimization heuristic for the cost trade-off between TPT reduction and <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> inventories. In a case study at Thales Netherlands with limited options for TPT reduction, we find a net saving of 5. 6 % on <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> inventories. In an extensive numerical experiment, we find a 20 % cost reduction on average compared to standard <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> inventory optimization.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} address and position <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> contracts as a form of servitisation in industries and look at its demands and features. For this paper, literatures relating to servitisation and its different types have been studied with keywords such as: servitisation, <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> contracts and support contracts, then positioning the <b>spare</b> <b>part</b> contracts in servitisation concept has been studied and tried to show the difference between service supply chain and product supply chain.

5|$|Casey's initial {{need was}} for {{engineer}} units {{to accomplish the}} daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of tractors, graders, concrete mixers and welding equipment. In {{the absence of a}} proper stock control system, an overall coordinating agency, and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was <b>spare</b> <b>parts.</b> Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke. A large proportion of equipment became unserviceable for lack of <b>spare</b> <b>parts.</b> Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so recourse was made to the limited sources of supply in Australia.|$|E
