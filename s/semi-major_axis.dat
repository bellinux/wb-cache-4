5|$|The <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> of Pluto's orbit varies between about 39.3 and 39.6au with {{a period}} of about 19,951 years, {{corresponding}} to an orbital period varying between 246 and 249 years. The <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> and period are presently getting longer.|$|E
5|$|In a {{paper by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos {{evidence}} is shown {{for a possible}} bimodal distribution of the distances to the ascending nodes of the ETNOs. This correlation {{is unlikely to be}} the result of observational bias since it also appears in the nodal distribution of large <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> centaurs and comets. If it is due to the extreme TNOs experiencing close approaches to Planet Nine, it is consistent with a planet with a <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> of 300–400 AU.|$|E
5|$|A {{companion}} {{paper by}} Brown and Batygin extended the cluster {{to include a}} seventh object, , with a <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> of 227 AU; and noted the absence of objects with perihelia beyond 42 AU and semi-major axes between 100 AU and 200 AU.|$|E
5|$|A vulcanoid is an {{asteroid}} {{in a stable}} orbit with a <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> {{less than that of}} Mercury (i.e. 0.387AU). This does not include objects like sungrazing comets, which, although they have perihelia inside the orbit of Mercury, have far greater semi-major axes.|$|E
5|$|Since early 2016, {{seven more}} extreme trans-Neptunian objects have been {{discovered}} with orbits that have a perihelion greater than 30AU and a <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> greater than250 AU. These are {{also included in the}} orbital diagrams and tables below.|$|E
5|$|The Carme {{group is}} spread over only 1.2Gm in <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis,</b> 1.6° in {{inclination}} (165.7±0.8°), and eccentricities between 0.23 and 0.27. It is very homogeneous in color (light red) and {{is believed to}} have originated from a D-type asteroid progenitor, possibly a Jupiter Trojan.|$|E
5|$|The Saturnian moons {{are listed}} here by orbital period (or <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis),</b> from {{shortest}} to longest. Moons massive enough for their surfaces to have collapsed into a spheroid are highlighted in bold, while the irregular moons {{are listed in}} red, orange and gray background.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} classification, {{introduced by}} B. J. Gladman, B. G. Marsden and C. Van Laerhoven in 2007, uses 10-million-year orbit integration {{instead of the}} Tisserand parameter. An object qualifies as an SDO if its orbit is not resonant, has a <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> no greater than 2000 AU, and, during the integration, its <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> shows an excursion of 1.5 AU or more. Gladman et al. suggest the term scattering disk object to emphasize this present mobility. If the object is not an SDO as per the above definition, but the eccentricity of its orbit is greater than 0.240, it is classified as a detached TNO. (Objects with smaller eccentricity are considered classical.) In this scheme, the disc extends from the orbit of Neptune to 2000 AU, the region {{referred to as the}} inner Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|Plutoids are {{celestial}} {{bodies in}} orbit around the Sun at a <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> {{greater than that of}} Neptune that have sufficient mass for their self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that they assume a hydrostatic equilibrium (near-spherical) shape, and that have not cleared the neighbourhood around their orbit. Satellites of plutoids are not plutoids themselves.|$|E
5|$|SDOs are {{typically}} characterized by orbits with medium and high eccentricities with a <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> greater than 50AU, but their perihelia bring them within influence of Neptune. Having a perihelion of roughly 30AU {{is one of}} the defining characteristics of scattered objects, as it allows Neptune to exert its gravitational influence.|$|E
5|$|The Ananke {{group has}} a {{relatively}} wider spread {{than the previous}} groups, over 2.4Gm in <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis,</b> 8.1° in inclination (between 145.7° and 154.8°), and eccentricities between 0.02 and 0.28. Most of the members appear gray, and {{are believed to have}} formed from the breakup of a captured asteroid.|$|E
5|$|George Forbes was {{the first}} to {{postulate}} the existence of trans-Neptunian planets in 1880, and his work is considered similar to more recent Planet Nine theories. In Forbes's model the planet had a <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> of ∼300 AU (roughly three hundred times the distance from Earth to the Sun); locations were based on clustering of the aphelion distances of periodic comets.|$|E
5|$|In {{a revised}} version of the Nice model Jupiter trojans are {{captured}} when Jupiter encounters an ice giant during the instability. In {{this version of the}} Nice model one of the ice giants (Uranus, Neptune, or a lost fifth planet) is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is scattered outward by Jupiter causing the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn to quickly separate. When Jupiter's <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> jumps during these encounters existing Jupiter trojans can escape and new objects with semi-major axes similar to Jupiter's new <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> are captured. Following its last encounter the ice giant can pass through one of the libration points and perturb their orbits leaving this libration point depleted relative to the other. After the encounters end some of these Jupiter trojans are lost and others captured when Jupiter and Saturn are near weak mean motion resonances such as the 3:7 resonance via the mechanism of the original Nice model.|$|E
5|$|Janus and Epimetheus {{are called}} co-orbital moons. They are of roughly equal size, with Janus being {{slightly}} larger than Epimetheus. Janus and Epimetheus have orbits {{with only a few}} kilometers difference in <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis,</b> close enough that they would collide if they attempted to pass each other. Instead of colliding, however, their gravitational interaction causes them to swap orbits every four years.|$|E
5|$|Large lengths, such as {{the radius}} of a giant star or the <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> of a binary star system, are often {{expressed}} in terms of the astronomical unit — approximately equal to the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150 million km or approximately 93 million miles). In 2012, the IAU defined the astronomical constant to be an exact length in meters: 149,597,870,700 m.|$|E
5|$|The {{long term}} {{stability}} of anti-aligned extreme trans-Neptunian objects with orbits that intersect that of Planet Nine {{is the result}} of their resonant dynamics. Objects in mean-motion resonances with a massive planet are phase protected, preventing them from making close approaches to the planet. When the orbit of a resonant object drifts out of phase,} causing it to make closer approaches to a massive planet, the changes in the perturbations the planet exerts on the object alters its <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> in the direction that reverses the drift. This process repeats as the drift continues in the other direction causing the orbit to appear to rock back and forth, or librate, about a stable center when viewed in a rotating frame of reference. In the example at right, when the orbit of a plutino drifts backward it loses angular momentum when it makes closer approaches ahead of Neptune, causing its <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> and period to shrink, reversing the drift.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the Outer Solar System Survey (OSSOS) {{suggests}} that the observed clustering {{is the result of}} a combination of observing bias and small number statistics. OSSOS, a well-characterized survey of the outer Solar System with known biases, observed eight trans-Neptunian objects with <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> > 150 AU with orbits oriented on a wide range of directions. After accounting for the known observational biases of the survey, no evidence for the arguments of perihelion (ω) clustering identified by Trujillo and Sheppard was seen and the orientation of the orbits of the objects with the largest <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> was statistically consistent with random. A previously released paper by Mike Brown analyzed the discovery locations of eccentric trans-Neptunian objects. While identifying some biases he found that even with these biases the clustering of longitudes of perihelion of the known objects would be observed only 1.2% of the time if their actual distribution was uniform.|$|E
5|$|A {{previous}} {{analysis by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos of commensurabilities among the known ETNOs using Monte Carlo techniques revealed a pattern {{similar to that}} of the Kuiper belt, where accidental commensurabilities occur due to objects in resonances with Neptune. They find that this pattern would be best explained if the ETNOs were in resonance with an additional planetary-sized object beyond Pluto and note that a number of these objects may be in 5:3 and 3:1 resonances if that object had <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> of ≈700 AU.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the clustering of the perihelia and the orbital poles of distant objects, Planet Nine offers explanations for the high perihelion of Sedna and , for objects with orbits roughly perpendicular {{to those of the}} planets, for high inclination TNOs with semi-major axes less than 100 AU, and for the tilt of the Sun's rotation axis. The objects it dynamically controls would form a cloud centered on its <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> {{with a wide range of}} inclinations.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter trojans have orbits with radii between 5.05 and 5.35AU (the mean <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> is 5.2±0.15AU), and are {{distributed}} throughout elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points; each swarm stretches for about 26° along {{the orbit of}} Jupiter, amounting to a total distance of about 2.5AU. The width of the swarms approximately equals two Hill's radii, which {{in the case of}} Jupiter amounts to about 0.6AU. Many of Jupiter trojans have large orbital inclinations relative to Jupiter's orbital plane—up to 40°.|$|E
5|$|Skirting {{the inner}} {{edge of the}} belt (ranging between 1.78 and 2.0 AU, with a mean <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> of 1.9AU) is the Hungaria family of minor planets. They are named after the main member, 434 Hungaria; the group {{contains}} at least 52 named asteroids. The Hungaria group is separated from the main body by the 4:1 Kirkwood gap and their orbits have a high inclination. Some members belong to the Mars-crossing category of asteroids, and gravitational perturbations by Mars are likely a factor in reducing {{the total population of}} this group.|$|E
5|$|The <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> of an {{asteroid}} {{is used to}} describe the dimensions of its orbit around the Sun, and its value determines the minor planet's orbital period. In 1866, Daniel Kirkwood announced the discovery of gaps in the distances of these bodies' orbits from the Sun. They were located at positions where their period of revolution about the Sun was an integer fraction of Jupiter's orbital period. Kirkwood proposed that the gravitational perturbations of the planet led to the removal of asteroids from these orbits.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of the {{recognized}} moons of the planets and of the largest dwarf planets of the Solar System. The 19 moons that are large enough to have been rounded by their own gravity are listed in bold. The seven largest moons, which are larger than any of the known dwarf planets, are listed in bold and italic. Sidereal period differs from <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> because it depends on the mass of the primary as well as the satellite's distance from it.|$|E
5|$|When {{the mean}} orbital period of an {{asteroid}} is an integer {{fraction of the}} orbital period of Jupiter, a mean-motion resonance with the gas giant is created that is sufficient to perturb an asteroid to new orbital elements. Asteroids that become located in the gap orbits (either primordially because of the migration of Jupiter's orbit, or due to prior perturbations or collisions) are gradually nudged into different, random orbits with a larger or smaller <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis,</b> with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E
5|$|M-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of {{the total}} population; their spectra {{resemble}} that of iron-nickel. Some {{are believed to have}} formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope {{does not appear to be}} primarily composed of metal. Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> of about 2.7AU. It is not yet clear whether all M-types are compositionally similar, or whether it is a label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes.|$|E
5|$|The current {{understanding}} of planetary habitability—the {{ability of a}} world to develop environmental conditions favorable {{to the emergence of}} life—favors planets that have liquid water on their surface. Most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone, which for the Sun extends from just beyond Venus to about the <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> of Mars. During perihelion, Mars dips inside this region, but Mars's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods. The past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability. Recent evidence has suggested that any water on the Martian surface may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} the orbit is {{accurately}} known at 5.539years, although this has changed over time due to mass loss and accretion. The period between the Great Eruption and the smaller 1890 eruption was apparently 5.52years, while before the Great Eruption {{it may have been}} lower still, possibly between 4.8 and 5.4years. The orbital separation is only known approximately, with a <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> of 15–16AU. The orbit is highly eccentric, e = 0.9. This means that the separation of the stars varies from around 1.6AU, similar to the distance of Mars from the Sun, to 30AU, similar to the distance of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The team {{released}} a paper of their findings dated April 27, 2007, {{published in the}} July 2007 journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. At the time of discovery, it {{was reported to be}} the first potentially Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of its star and the smallest known extrasolar planet around a main-sequence star but on April 21, 2009, another planet orbiting Gliese 581, Gliese 581e, with an approximate mass of 1.9 Earth masses, was announced. In the paper, they also announced the discovery of another planet in the system, Gliese 581d, with a minimum mass of 7.7 Earth masses and a <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> of 0.25 astronomical units.|$|E
5|$|Cory Shankman et al. {{examined}} {{the consequences of}} a distant massive perturber on the TNOs used to infer the planet's existence. They simulated clones (objects with similar orbits) of 15 objects with <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> > 150 AU and perihelion > 30 AU under the influence of a 10 Earth-massed Planet Nine in Batygin and Brown's best fit orbit. While longitude of perihelion alignment of the objects with <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> > 250 AU was observed in their simulations, the alignment of the arguments of perihelion was not. The simulations also revealed an increase in the inclinations of many objects, thereby predicting a larger reservoir of high-inclination TNOs. These objects should have been detected in existing surveys but are still unseen so far—suggesting there is a currently missing or unseen signature of Planet Nine. A previously published paper concluded that current observations are insufficient to identify this signature, however. The perihelia of many of the objects also rose and fell smoothly, inconsistent with the current absence of extreme TNOs with perihelia between 50 AU and 70 AU. Their perihelia also reached values where the objects would not be observed and, after declining, fell low enough for the objects to enter planet-crossing orbits leading to their ejection from the Solar System. These factors would require a population of Sednas significantly larger than current estimates, and inconsistent with current models of the early Solar System, to explain current observations. Based on these challenges Shankman et al. concluded that the existence of Planet Nine is unlikely and that the currently observed alignment of the existing TNOs is a temporary phenomenon that will disappear as more objects are detected.|$|E
5|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{including a}} distant massive planet were also conducted by other groups. Lawler et al. {{found that the}} dynamical effect of Planet Nine would generate a cloud of objects centered around Planet Nine's <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis,</b> with most at greater semi-major axes. A massive planet in a circular orbit at 250 AU {{increased the number of}} high perihelion objects threefold; one at 500 AU with an eccentricity of 0.5 increased these tenfold, and left a significant fraction with inclinations greater than 60°. Simulations conducted by Nesvorny et al. of the giant planet migration described in the Nice model that included Planet Nine in its nominal orbit yield similar results, with roughly 0.3–0.4 Earth masses of an initial 20 Earth mass planetesimal disk remaining in what they called the Planet Nine cloud {{at the end of a}} simulation of the last 4 billion years.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{effects of}} Planet Nine would explain five {{aspects of the}} Solar System: the clustering of the orbits of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (eTNOs); the high perihelia of objects like Sedna that are detached from Neptune's influence; the high inclinations of eTNOs with orbits roughly perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} Solar System, high inclination Kuiper belt objects with <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> less than 100 AU, and the obliquity, or tilt, of the Sun's axis relative to the plane of the Solar System. While other mechanisms have been offered for many of these peculiarities the gravitational influence of Planet Nine {{is the only one that}} explains all five. The dynamical effects of Planet Nine also excite the inclinations of scattering objects, which in numerical simulations leaves the inclination distribution of short-period comets with a broader distribution than is observed.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{original}} Nice model, objects are captured into resonances with Neptune during its outward migration. Some remain in the resonances, others evolve onto higher-inclination, lower-eccentricity orbits, and are released onto stable orbits forming the dynamically hot classical belt. The hot belt's inclination distribution can be reproduced if Neptune migrated from 24 AU to 30 AU on a 30 Myr timescale. When Neptune migrates to 28 AU, it has a gravitational encounter with the extra ice giant. Objects captured from the cold belt into the 1:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune are left behind as a local concentration at 44 AU when this encounter causes Neptune's <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> to jump outward. The objects deposited in the cold belt include some loosely bound 'blue' binaries originating from closer than the cold belt's current location. If Neptune's eccentricity remains small during this encounter, the chaotic evolution of orbits of {{the original}} Nice model is avoided and a primordial cold belt is preserved. In the later phases of Neptune's migration, a slow sweeping of mean-motion resonances removes the higher-eccentricity objects from the cold belt, truncating its eccentricity distribution.|$|E
5|$|The {{clustering}} of {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects and raising of their perihelia is reproduced in simulations that include Planet Nine. In simulations conducted by Batygin and Brown swarms of planetesimals that began with large <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> orbits at random orientations and initially interacting with Neptune were sculpted into collinear groups of spatially confined orbits by a distant planet if it is substantially more massive than Earth and on a highly eccentric orbit. These surviving objects were in orbits that were oriented with their long axes anti-aligned {{with respect to the}} massive planet and were roughly co-planar with it. The objects were also found to be in resonance with the massive planet. The resonances included high-order resonances, for example 27:17, and were interconnected, yielding an orbital evolution that was fundamentally chaotic, causing their semi-major axes to vary unpredictably on million-year timescales. The perihelia of these objects were also raised temporarily, producing Sedna-like orbits, before being returned to orbits more typical of typical trans-Neptunian objects after several hundred million years. Some of the eTNOs also evolved into orbits perpendicular to the plane of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The secular {{evolution}} of the objects' orbits varies with their orbits. The orbits of some objects are metastable, for example, some that are initially aligned with Planet Nine. The orbits of these objects precess until parts of the orbits are tangent to that of Planet Nine, leading to close encounters. Some stable orbits do exist for aligned objects with smaller eccentricities. Objects in these orbits have high perihelia and {{have yet to be}} observed, however, and an additional perturbation would have been required to be captured in these orbits. The curves followed also vary with the <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> of the object, with the region where aligned orbits are possible decreasing for larger semi-major axes. Without the inclusion of resonant dynamics the secular dynamics becomes more complex for inclined objects with semi-major axes beyond 300 AU. Alignment and anti-alignment is this case is more the result of sticky chaos rather than confinement with orbits evolving widely but spending more time in regions of relative stability associated with secular resonances. Including the resonant dynamics, for example if Sedna is in a 3:2 resonance with Planet Nine as proposed by Malhotra, Volk and Wang, also alters these curves and can shift the centers of the libration islands away from anti-alignment.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} stars with {{confirmed}} planetary systems in Auriga; {{there is also}} a white dwarf with a suspected planetary system. HD 40979 has one planet, HD 40979 b. It was discovered in 2002 through radial velocity measurements on the parent star. HD 40979 is 33.3 parsecs from Earth, a spectral class F8V star of magnitude 6.74—just past the limit of visibility to the naked eye. It is of similar size to the Sun, at 1.1 solar masses and 1.21 solar radii. The planet, with a mass of 3.83 Jupiter masses, orbits with a <b>semi-major</b> <b>axis</b> of 0.83 AU and a period of 263.1 days. HD 45350 has one planet as well. HD 45350 b was discovered through radial velocity measurements in 2004. It has a mass of 1.79 Jupiter masses and orbits every 890.76 days at a distance of 1.92 AU. Its parent star is faint, at an apparent magnitude of 7.88, a G5IV type star 49 parsecs away. It has a mass of 1.02 solar masses and a radius of 1.27 solar radii. HD 43691 b is a significantly larger planet, with a mass of 2.49 Jupiter masses; it is also far closer to its parent star, HD 43691. Discovered in 2007 from radial velocity measurements, it orbits at a distance of 0.24 AU with a period of 36.96 days. HD 43691 has a radius identical to the Sun's, though it is more dense—its mass is 1.38 solar masses. It is a G0IV type star of magnitude 8.03, 93.2 parsecs from Earth.|$|E
