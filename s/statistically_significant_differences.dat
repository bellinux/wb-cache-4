A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide, {{one of the}} most common supplements in the United States, and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body. This review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate than in those who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts. For fortification, however, a 2003 review recommended cereals (containing zinc oxide) as a cheap, stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms.

25|$|Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) is {{a method}} for {{determining}} whether the activation of a particular brain region changes between experimental conditions, stimuli, or over time. The essential idea is simple, and consists of two major steps: first, one performs a univariate statistical test on each individual voxel between each experimental condition. Second, one analyzes the clustering of the voxels that show <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences,</b> and determines which brain regions exhibit different levels of activation under different experimental conditions.|$|E
25|$|The aim of {{explicit}} phylogenetic methods {{is to compare}} gene trees with their associated species trees. While weakly supported differences between gene and species trees can be due to inference uncertainty, <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> can be suggestive of HGT events (see Figure 1a). For example, if two genes from different species share the most recent ancestral connecting node in the gene tree, but the respective species are spaced apart in the species tree, an HGT event can be invoked. Such an approach can produce more detailed results than parametric approaches because the involved species, time and direction of transfer can potentially be identified.|$|E
25|$|A 1967 study where a judge {{randomly}} assigned (ordered) offenders to either clinical treatment, AA treatment, or to a no treatment (control) group.

25|$|In a pooled {{analysis}} of 7 comparative trials with imipramine, milnacipran and imipramine {{were shown to}} have comparable efficacy while milnacipran was significantly better tolerated. A pooled {{analysis of}} studies comparing milnacipran and SSRIs concluded a superior efficacy for milnacipran with similar tolerability for milnacipran and SSRIs. A more recent meta-analysis of 6 studies involving more than 1,000 patients showed no distinction between milnacipran and SSRIs in efficacy or discontinuation rates, including discontinuation for side effects or lack of efficacy. A meta-analysis {{of a total of}} 16 randomized controlled trials with more than 2200 patients concluded that there were no <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability when comparing milnacipran with other antidepressant agents.

500|$|In {{other cases}} gender {{differences}} have been exaggerated, potentially encouraging unjustified stereotyping. In recent works Julie A.

Conducting meta-analyses of recent studies, she demonstrates that, while <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> in measures of mean risk aversion are sometimes found, the substantive size of these group-level differences tend to be small (on {{the order of a}} fraction of a standard deviation), and many other studies fail to find a statistically significant difference at all.

500|$|The American white ibis pairs up {{in spring}} and breeds in huge colonies, often with other waterbird species. Nesting begins as soon as {{suitable}} foraging and nesting habitat is available. The female selects the site, usually in {{the branches of a}} tree or shrub, which is often over water, and builds the nest, and males assist by bringing nest material. Anywhere from one to five eggs are typically laid, with two or three being the most common. The eggs are matt pale blue-green in color with brown splotches and measure [...] and weigh on average [...] Clutch sizes are usually lower in coastal colonies as compared to inland colonies, although there are no <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> in the fledging rate of both colonies. Throughout the mating and incubation period, the male undergoes a period of starvation to stay close to the nest and aggressively defend his nest and mate from both predators and other ibises in preference to foraging for food. In the 2006 breeding season, a non-breeding adult female was observed to be tending to multiple nests that belonged to other American white ibises—the first time the behavior has been documented for this species.|$|E

2500|$|In general, {{expression}} profiling studies report those {{genes that}} showed <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> under changed experimental conditions. This is typically {{a small fraction}} of the genome [...] for several reasons. First, different cells and tissues express a subset of genes as a direct consequence of cellular differentiation so many genes are turned off. Second, many of the genes code for proteins that are required for survival in very specific amounts so many genes do not change. Third, cells use many other mechanisms to regulate proteins in addition to altering the amount of mRNA, so these genes may stay consistently expressed even when protein concentrations are rising and falling. Fourth, financial constraints limit expression profiling experiments to a small number of observations of the same gene under identical conditions, reducing the statistical power of the experiment, making it impossible for the experiment to identify important but subtle changes. Finally, it takes a great amount of effort to discuss the biological significance of each regulated gene, so scientists often limit their discussion to a subset. [...] Newer microarray analysis techniques automate certain aspects of attaching biological significance to expression profiling results, but this remains a very difficult problem.|$|E
