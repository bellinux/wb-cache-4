40|$|AbstractAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are {{associated}} with atherosclerosis, transmural degenerative processes, neovascularization, decrease in content of vascular smooth muscle cells, and a chronic infiltration, mainly located in the outer aortic wall. The chronic infiltration consists mainly of macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. The dominant cells are Th 2 restricted CD 3 + lymphocytes expressing interleukine 4, 5, 8, and 10, and tumor necrosis factor-α for regulation of the local immune response. They also produce interferon-γ and CD 40 ligand to stimulate surrounding cells to produce matrix metalloproteases and cysteine proteases for aortic matrix remodeling. The lymphocyte activation may be mediated by microorganisms as well as autoantigens generated from vascular structural proteins, perhaps through molecular mimicry. As in autoimmune diseases, the risk of AAA is increased by certain genotypes concerning human leucocyte antigen class II. These types are also associated with increased aneurysmal inflammation indicating a genetic susceptibility to aortic inflammation. Chlamydia pneumoniae is often detected in AAA but {{the validity of the}} methods can be questioned, and two small antibiotic trials have been disappointing. However, <b>serum</b> antibodies <b>against</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> have been associated with AAA growth and cross-react with AAA wall proteins. Thus, immune responses mediated by microorganisms and autoantigens may play a pivotal role in AAA pathogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Background. Investigators have {{attributed}} {{protective effects}} of statins <b>against</b> <b>pneumonia</b> and other infections. However, these reports {{are based on}} observational data where treatments are not assigned randomly. We aimed {{to determine if the}} protective effects of statins <b>against</b> <b>pneumonia</b> are due to nonrandom treatment assignment. Methods. We built a cohort consisting of 124 695 Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for which we had complete claims data. We considered patients who survived at least 30 days post-AMI (full sample), or who survived for 1 year post-AMI (survivors). First, we used ordinary least squares (OLS) and logit models to determine if receiving a statin was protective <b>against</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> Second, to control for nonrandom treatment assignment, we performed an instrumental variables analysis using geographic treatment rates as an instrument. All models included patient demographics, medications, diagnoses, length of hospital stay, and out-of-pocket drug costs as covariates. Our outcome measure was a pneumonia diagnosis during the 1 year following AMI. Results. A total of 76 994 patients (61. 9 %) filled a statin prescription, and 19 078 (15. 3 %) were diagnosed with pneumonia. Using OLS, the statin coefficient was − 0. 016 (P . 6). Conclusions. For patients with AMI, the protective effect of statins <b>against</b> <b>pneumonia</b> is most likely the result of nonrandom treatment assignment (ie, a healthy-user bias) ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Guillain-Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is {{an acute}} postinfectious immune-mediated polyneuropathy. Although preceding respiratory tract infections with Mycoplasma pneumoniae {{have been reported}} in some cases, the role of M. pneumoniae in the pathogenesis of GBS remains unclear. We here cultured, for the first time, M. pneumoniae from a GBS patient with antibodies against galactocerebroside (GalC), which cross-reacted with the isolate. This case prompted us to unravel the role of M. pneumoniae in GBS in a case-control study. ETHODS: We included 189 adults and 24 children with GBS and compared them to control cohorts for analysis of <b>serum</b> antibodies <b>against</b> M. <b>pneumoniae</b> (n = 479) and GalC (n = 198). RESULTS: Anti-M. pneumoniae immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies were detected in GBS patients and healthy controls in 3 % and 0 % of adults (p = 0. 16) and 21 % and 7 % of children (p = 0. 03), respectively. Anti-GalC antibodies (IgM and/or IgG) were found in 4 % of adults and 25 % of children with GBS (p = 0. 001). Anti-GalC-positive patients showed more-frequent preceding respiratory symptoms, cranial nerve involvement, and a better outcome. Anti-GalC antibodies correlated with anti-M. pneumoniae antibodies (p < 0. 001) and cross-reacted with different M. pneumoniae strains. Anti-GalC IgM antibodies were not only found in GBS patients with M. pneumoniae infection, but also in patients without neurological disease (8 % vs 9 %; p = 0. 87), whereas anti-GalC IgG was exclusively found in patients with GBS (9 % vs 0 %; p = 0. 006). INTERPRETATION: M. pneumoniae infection is associated with GBS, more frequently in children than adults, and elicits anti-GalC antibodies, of which specifically anti-GalC IgG may contribute to the pathogenesis of GBS.

40|$|Epidemiologic {{studies of}} Chlamydia pneumoniae have been {{conducted}} throughout the world. A rate of antibody prevalence of approximately 50 % {{has been found in}} adults, with small regional differences. We studied the antibody prevalence of C. pneumoniae in healthy persons and patients with acute respiratory infections in Japan. The microplate immunofluorescence antibody (MFA) technique was used for measuring antibodies, and the cases with IgG titers of ≥ 1 : 64 were considered to have had past chlamydial exposure. Using this criterion, positive <b>serum</b> antibodies <b>against</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> were found in 67. 4 % of healthy subjects and 74. 2 % of adult patients with respiratory infections. Some seroepidemiologic studies in Western countries have shown that epidemics of C. pneumoniae respiratory infections occur in a 4 – 6 -year cycle, like a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. However, during our 7 –year survey from 1988 to 1994, {{we were not able to}} observe any epidemic episodes. The prevalence of the antibody was lower than 10 % in children 5 years old or younger. It increased rapidly between ages 6 and 15, reaching a plateau of 60 %. Results suggest that in Japan a high infection rate might occur in children at nursery schools, kindergartens and elementary schools. We encountered an outbreak of C. pneumoniae infection and we were able to trace the source of the infection to a family and the spread of the infection to the schools which the children attended. Transmission is of the non-vector type. The incubation period is 3 to 4 weeks. Transmission occurs only after repeated and close contacts. Small outbreaks may occur in households and schools where persons have prolonged close contacts. Unlike acute viral infections, it may spread slowly...|$|R

40|$|An {{enterotoxin}} {{with the}} ability to induce fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loops, erythema in the skin of guinea pigs, and lethality in mice appears in cell extracts (CE) and culture filtrates (CF) of sporulating cells of some Clostridium perfringens type A strains. All activities in CE and CF were eluted simultaneously from a Sephadex G- 200 column. Different elution patterns were obtained for these activities present in CE and CF. Rabbit immune <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> CF and the active CE fractions eliminated the three biological activities in CE and CF. These activities present in CF and CE were not eliminated by any of the known antitoxins present in diagnostic <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> C. perfringens types A, B, C, D, and E. Immunodiffusion studies with immune <b>serum</b> <b>against</b> active CE fractions and CF indicated a precipitin line of identity between CF and CE of NCTC 8798 and other enterotoxin-positive strains but not enterotoxin-negative strains. Disc electrophoresis of active G- 200 fractions on 7. 0 % polyacrylamide gels revealed a single area containing erythemal activity and mouse lethality.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the fourth part of a comprehensive programme undertaken by the WHO International Reference Centre for Enteroviruses and other laboratories for the testing of enterovirus equine antisera prepared for long-term use as reference antisera. The studies were designed to appraise the specificity of the immune serum of horses inoculated with prototype enteroviruses (coxsackievirus types A 2, 4, 8, 10, 11, 14 - 16, 18 - 21, and 24, and echoviruses E 21, 27, 30, 31, and 33). Tests for neutralizing antibody were performed against the homologous viruses and against available regional homotypic strains. Heterotypic tests were performed against reoviruses 1 - 3, adenoviruses 1 - 31, and the entire series of enteroviruses (with the exception of enterovirus 68). The homologous geometric mean titre of the 5 echovirus antisera ranged from 3 000 to 10 000; the titre of 1 coxsackievirus antiserum (A 24) was only about 400, but the titres of the others ranged from 1 500 to 14 000.
