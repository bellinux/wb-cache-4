5|$|At {{the end of}} August, Watrin {{learned that}} Phoenix was alone off the port and {{sent a message to}} Leghorn, where the {{remainder}} of the French squadron <b>still</b> <b>lay</b> at anchor, instructing them to attack the isolated British warship. Succès and Bravoure sailed on 31 August and arrived off Piombino at 06:30 on 2 September to discover that the frigates Pomone and , under Captain George Cockburn, had joined Phoenix. Halsted had received an intelligence report detailing Watrin's demand that the French ships sail from Leghorn and had summoned reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1874 in Fujian, China, Tan came to Singapore {{at the age}} of 16 to {{join his}} father's business. In 1904, Tan struck out on his own, selling pineapples and rice and {{manufacturing}} rubber tyres and shoes. Tan's rubber business flourished and, with growing wealth, he altruistically donated money to many schools and established Amoy University (now Xiamen University). However, Tan's loyalty <b>still</b> <b>lay</b> with his motherland and he ardently supported opponents of the Qing rulers during the Xinhai Revolution. By this time, Tan's philanthropic work and political inclinations had made him a popular figure amongst the Chinese in Singapore and China.|$|E
5|$|Between the Humber and Forth the English {{had formed}} into two main kingdoms, Deira and Bernicia, often united as the Kingdom of Northumbria. A number of Celtic kingdoms also existed in this region, {{including}} Craven, Elmet, Rheged, and Gododdin. A native British kingdom, later called the Kingdom of Strathclyde, survived {{as an independent}} power into the 10th century in the area which became modern-day Dunbartonshire and Clydesdale. To the north-west of Strathclyde lay the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata, and to the north-east {{a small number of}} Pictish kingdoms. Further north <b>still</b> <b>lay</b> the great Pictish kingdom of Fortriu, which after the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 came to be the strongest power in the northern half of Britain. The Irish had always had contacts {{with the rest of the}} British Isles, and during the early 6th century they immigrated from the island of Ireland to form the kingdom of Dál Riata, although exactly how much conquest took place is a matter of dispute with historians. It also appears likely that the Irish settled in parts of Wales, and even after the period of Irish settlement, Irish missionaries were active in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Lobengula {{moved to}} the north-east, now well out of the Company's reach for the {{foreseeable}} future. However, his sickness, {{which turned out to}} be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894. With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been killed in the war. He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which <b>still</b> <b>lay</b> where they had fallen. Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand.|$|E
5|$|The Panthers {{moved to}} the new National Ice Centre in September 2000 but endured a terrible first season in their new home. They were knocked out at the semi final stage of the Benson & Hedges Cup by the Steelers and {{suffered}} a dire first half to the regular season. By Christmas the team faced the prospect of not qualifying for {{the playoffs for the}} first time since 1985. Form improved during the second half of the season with the team winning five of their first seven home games during 2001, including a 6–4 victory over the Sheffield Steelers marred by a violent bench clearing brawl. The Panthers <b>still</b> <b>lay</b> in ninth and last place going into their final game of the regular season, three points behind their opponents Newcastle Jesters. Nottingham required a regulation time win to claim the eighth and final playoff berth, something they had not done away from their home ice all season. The Jesters needed only to tie. With 10.1 seconds to go, the game was locked at 2–2, but with an extra attacker the Panthers won a faceoff next to the Newcastle goal and Robert Nordmark scored with 4.4 seconds remaining to take them into the playoffs and eliminate the Jesters. In the playoffs a 5–0 win over a financially troubled Sheffield Steelers was their only victory of the post season.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} the Northern and Southern dynasties that regular script rose to {{dominant}} status. During that period, regular script continued evolving stylistically, reaching full maturity in the early Tang dynasty. Some call the writing of the early Tang calligrapher Ouyang Xun (557–641) the first mature regular script. After this point, although developments in the art of calligraphy and in character simplification <b>still</b> <b>lay</b> ahead, there were no more major stages of evolution for the mainstream script.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the treaty}} was in Bulgaria's favour, {{it was a}} welcome respite by the Byzantines, who had to regroup their forces after {{successive}} defeats, and who faced another round of internal turmoil because of the revival of iconoclasm. Bulgaria {{on the other hand}} also faced religious problems, as the growing number of Christians disturbed Omurtag: the Khan began anti-Christian persecutions, to which his eldest son Enravota also fell victim.

25|$|At the time, much of Calabria {{was a wild}} place. The 1783 Calabrian {{earthquakes}} killed 100,000 people. Parts of Reggio <b>still</b> <b>lay</b> {{in ruins}} as late as 1813 and many churches had not been rebuilt in 1806. The hardy Calabrians had a strong independent streak and practiced the vendetta against neighboring families and villages. Plundering French troops and greedy French civil authorities quickly ignited a revolt by the proud Calabrian peasants. However, {{the people of the}} major towns hated the Neapolitan royal administration and generally favored the French. The rebellion flared up after individual events. At Scigliano the French left a detail of 50 soldiers. A woman was raped, the villagers rose up, and most of the Frenchmen were slaughtered. The French commanders had only one answer to such incidents, to attack, plunder, and burn down the offending village. This led to a vicious cycle of atrocity and counter-atrocity. For his part, Joseph Bonaparte tried to be fair, even ordering French soldiers to be shot for criminal offenses and French officials to be tried for malfeasance.|$|E
25|$|Harley came {{to power}} advocating peace – a just peace for Britain and all its allies. However, {{the other members of}} the Grand Alliance, as well as the Whig {{directors}} of the Bank of England, had viewed with apprehension Anne's new government, and interpreted the fall of the Whigs as signifying a shift in war policy. To avoid a credit crisis at home and to dispel Allied fears abroad – thereby forestalling Vienna and The Hague rushing to make their own separate arrangements – the Harley government at first returned to the war strategy undertaken by the previous administration to secure from a position of strength an advantageous settlement. Marlborough remained at the head of the Anglo-Dutch army in Northern France, and by the end of the 1710 campaign the Duke and Eugene had added to their earlier success by capturing Béthune, Saint-Venant, and in early November, Aire-sur-la-Lys, thereby penetrating the second line of the pré carré. Yet these sieges had been costly and time consuming, and there had been no decisive breakthrough; moreover, between Marlborough and Paris <b>still</b> <b>lay</b> several fortresses and a new defensive line.|$|E
25|$|German {{casualties}} {{are hard}} to determine but commonly accepted figures are: 27,074 killed, 111,034 wounded and 18,384 missing. German dead may have been as high as 45,000 men, due to additional non-combat causes, wounded who died and missing who were confirmed dead. The battle for France had cost the Luftwaffe 28 percent of its front line strength, some 1,236–1,428 aircraft were destroyed (1,129 to enemy action, 299 in accidents). A further 323–488 were damaged (225 to enemy action, 263 in accidents), making 36 percent of the Luftwaffe strength lost or damaged. Luftwaffe casualties amounted to 6,653 men, including 4,417 aircrew; of these 1,129 were killed and 1,930 were reported missing or captured, {{many of whom were}} liberated from French prison camps upon the French capitulation. Italian casualties amounted to 631 or 642 men killed, 2,631 wounded and 616 reported missing. A further 2,151 men suffered from frostbite during the campaign. The official Italian numbers were compiled for a report on 18 July 1940, when many of the fallen <b>still</b> <b>lay</b> under snow and it is probable that most of the Italian missing were dead. Units operating in more difficult terrain had higher ratios of missing to killed but probably most of the missing had died.|$|E
60|$|And there, {{you will}} say, was {{an end of}} the matter. I am (you will say) {{naturally}} obtuse, cowardly, and mentally deficient.

500|$|Rhodesia had run {{itself as}} a self-governing colony since 1923, but {{ultimate}} responsibility for foreign affairs remained with Britain.

[...] In their attempt to prove that an independent Lisbon mission was legal, the Rhodesians presented an argument based on British legislation conferring on the colonial government the right to appoint its own [...] "diplomatic agents, or consular or trade representatives, in countries which are willing to receive them".
