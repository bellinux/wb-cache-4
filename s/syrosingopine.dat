50|$|A {{combination}} of the diabetes drug metformin and <b>syrosingopine</b> killed tumor cells in blood samples from leukemia patients, while it did not damage blood cells in samples from healthy patients. The {{combination of}} metformin and <b>syrosingopine</b> also reduced or eliminated tumors in mice with malignant liver cancer. The drugs interfere with the cancer cells' glucose (i.e. energy) supply and utilization. Cancer cells have much higher energy requirements than normal cells, making them vulnerable {{when there is a}} reduction in the available energy supply. <b>Syrosingopine</b> inhibits the degradation of sugars within the cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Syrosingopine</b> is a drug, {{derived from}} reserpine. It is used (since about 1960) to treat hypertension.|$|E
40|$|Thirty-two male {{patients}} were {{tested for the}} chronic effects of treatment under two dose levels of <b>syrosingopine</b> upon objectively measured behavior and subjective reactions. All patients completed three 28 -day treatment periods: (a) 1 mg <b>syrosingopine,</b> (b) 5 mg <b>syrosingopine,</b> and (c) matching placebo, given daily, and thus served as their own controls. Double-blind administration was effected, and ordering of treatments was counter-balanced across patients, to cancel out any practice effects. At {{the end of each}} treatment period, each patient was tested on the battery of behavioral tests. Thirty-five variables were scored from the test battery and examined statistically for the significance of the differences between all combinations of treatments: (1) placebo vs 1 mg <b>syrosingopine,</b> (2) placebo vs 5 mg <b>syrosingopine,</b> and (3) 1 mg vs 5 mg <b>syrosingopine.</b> Only three critical ratios were significant beyond the 5 % level, when, because of the large number of tests of significance made, five would be expected by chance alone. It therefore seems clear that test behavior was not significantly affected by the drug, in either 1 -mg or 5 -mg daily doses, as compared with a placebo. Thus, as tested in this experiment, the chronic administration of <b>syrosingopine,</b> both in low and in high doses, gave no adverse behavioral effects...|$|E
40|$|We {{report that}} the anticancer {{activity}} of the widely used diabetic drug metformin is strongly potentiated by <b>syrosingopine.</b> Synthetic lethality elicited by combining the two drugs is synergistic and specific to transformed cells. This effect is unrelated to syrosingopine's known role as an inhibitor of the vesicular monoamine transporters. <b>Syrosingopine</b> binds to the glycolytic enzyme α-enolase in vitro, and {{the expression of the}} γ-enolase isoform correlates with nonresponsiveness to the drug combination. <b>Syrosingopine</b> sensitized cancer cells to metformin and its more potent derivative phenformin far below the individual toxic threshold of each compound. Thus, combining <b>syrosingopine</b> and codrugs is a promising therapeutic strategy for clinical application for the treatment of cancer...|$|E
40|$|Gastric {{haemorrhage}} {{was produced}} regularly in mice within 6 {{hours of the}} subcutaneous injection of a large dose (2 to 10 mg. /kg.) of reserpine or of deserpidine. Rescinnamine, <b>syrosingopine</b> (SU- 3118), and tetrabenazine (Ro 1 - 9569) were less active. Gastric haemorrhage was also produced within 6 hours when 5 -hydroxytryptamine (10 mg. /kg.) was injected every half-hour. Neither reserpine nor 5 -hydroxytryptamine produced gastric haemorrhage in mice which had been vagotomized by tying the oesophagus at the cardio-oesophageal junction or which had been pre-treated with iproniazid. Amphetamine was less effective than iproniazid in preventing gastric haemorrhage after reserpine, and the following drugs were ineffective: cocaine, methyl phenidate (Ritalin), amarin, caffeine, nikethamide, lysergic acid diethylamide and its 2 -bromo derivative (BOL 148). Gastric haemorrhage was not observed in mice which had been given substantial doses of atropine or of hexamethonium before reserpine. The incidence of haemorrhage was substantially reduced by treatment with an antacid mixture. It is concluded that reserpine-like drugs cause gastric haemorrhage by a mechanism which has an important central component and which involves the liberation of 5 -hydroxytryptamine...|$|E
40|$|In mice, {{yohimbine}} {{appears to}} accentuate the normal “alarm” reactions (alerting, flight) to external stimuli. Imipramine increases this effect {{and at the same}} time converts a non-lethal dose of yohimbine into a lethal one. The effect of imipramine is greatly reduced by adrenalectomy or by treatment with reserpine, <b>syrosingopine,</b> ganglion-blocking drugs or adrenaline antagonists acting on sympathetic β-receptors. Hypnotic, anti-convulsant or anaesthetic agents, tetrabenazine or antagonists of 5 -hydroxytryptamine do not reduce the imipramine effect. A variety of drugs which, like imipramine, are known to interfere with the tissue binding of noradrenaline also increase the toxicity of yohimbine. Yohimbine significantly reduces brain noradrenaline content; adrenal catechol amines are slightly reduced. The results suggest that yohimbine releases noradrenaline from stores or nerves as a consequence of increased central sympathetic activity. Imipramine increases the actions and toxicity of yohimbine by increasing the effects of the released noradrenaline on β-receptors. The lethal effects of a high dose of yohimbine alone are not reduced by any of the treatments tested, and appear not to result from activation of sympathetic mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} six Rauwolfia {{alkaloids}} {{on the growth}} inhibitory effect of vinblastine (VBL) in rat ascites hepatoma AH 66 cells was investigated. When cells were treated with VBL and each alkaloid for 30 min, reserpine, rescinnamine, <b>syrosingopine,</b> and ajmaline markedly potentiated the effect of VBL, but dimethylaminoethylreserplinate hydrochloride (DMAR) and yohimbine did not influence. On the other hand, in the continuous treatment for 2 d, DMAR and yohimbine also potentiated the effect of VBL. All of alkaloids increased the intracellular VBL content. Among these alkaloids, reserpine markedly suppressed the activities of Mg^ ATPase and Ca^ ATPase in the plasma membrane and DMAR suppressed the activities of adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) except (Na^+-K^+) ATPase. Reserpine and DMAR {{did not affect the}} VBL binding to microtubules. Reserpine inhibited the microtubule polymerization by itself and synergistically acted with VBL on microtubules but DMAR did not affect the polymerization and the effect of VBL. From the results, it was indicated that all of Rauwolfia alkaloids suppressed the active extrusion of VBL, increased the intracellular VBL content, and potentiated the effect of VBL on AH 66 cells. Moreover, it was suggested that some of alkaloids including reserppine could enhance the effect of VBL even by a short term treatment because of their synergistical interaction with VBL on microtubules...|$|E
40|$|The transuterine {{potential}} difference (p. d.) {{generated by the}} endometrium was measured in vivo in anaesthetized, ovariectomized rats treated with 10 micrograms oestradiol- 17 beta each day for 3 days. Intravenous injection of adrenaline induced transient hyperpolarization of the p. d.; sigmoid dose-dependency was observed over the range 2 - 40 micrograms/kg. Pre-treatment of the rats with <b>syrosingopine</b> shifted the dose-response curve to the left (enhancement) while combined propranolol (800 micrograms/kg) and phentolamine (800 micrograms/kg) shifted the dose-response curve to the right (depression). Isoprenaline gave similar quantitative changes in the p. d. in vivo which displayed a similar time course and sigmoid dose-dependency. Propranolol alone (800 micrograms/kg) shifted this dose-response curve significantly to the right. Addition of adrenaline or isoprenaline to the serosal solution bathing uteri incubated in vitro after removal from oestradiol-treated rats induced changes in endometrial bioelectric activity that exhibited sigmoid dose-response curves for the transuterine p. d. and short-circuit current (Isc). Propranolol significantly shifted the dose-response curves for adrenaline to the right. Only adrenaline caused small but significant decreases in the uterine resistance but these were not dose-dependent. Acetylcholine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline and phenylephrine {{had no effect on}} the transuterine p. d. in vivo or in vitro or on the Isc in vitro. No significant electrical changes could be induced by adrenaline {{or any of the other}} drugs across the uteri from untreated ovariectomized rats either in vivo or in vitro. The transluminal membrane p. d. of surface endometrial cells measured with micro-electrodes was depolarized by an addition of serosal adrenaline but only 41 % of the cells successfully impaled responded in this way. The results indicate that endometrial cells under oestrogen stimulation possess electrogenic processes that can be modulated specifically by adrenaline through the mediation of a serosally sited beta-adrenoceptor. The physiological role of the mechanism has yet to be established...|$|E
