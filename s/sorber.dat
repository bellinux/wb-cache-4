5|$|Bowman Creek's main stem is {{designated}} as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and the watersheds of {{all but two of}} its tributaries have the same designation. The watersheds of the remaining two tributaries, <b>Sorber</b> Run and Cider Run, are {{designated as}} Exceptional Value waters, with standards even higher than those of High-Quality Coldwater Fisheries. Additionally, these two tributaries are the only Wilderness Trout Streams in Wyoming County. Wild trout naturally reproduce throughout all of the creek's tributaries. A total of ten named streams in the watershed of Bowman Creek are classified by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as Class A Wild Trout Waters. Most hold this designation for brook trout only, but Sugar Hollow Creek and a section of Roaring Run hold the designation for rainbow trout, either instead of or in addition to brook trout.|$|E
500|$|Whilst escorting Convoy SC 94 {{in early}} August 1942 {{as part of}} Escort Group C1, Assiniboines Type 286 radar spotted [...] in a heavy fog on 6 August. The {{destroyer}} closed on the contact and briefly spotted the submarine twice before losing her in the fog. The submarine reappeared crossing the destroyer's bow at a range of , and both ships opened fire. The range was too close for Assiniboines 4.7-inch guns to engage, but her [...]50-calibre machine guns shot up the submarine's deck and conning tower. This kept the Germans from manning their [...] deck gun, but the [...] flak gun was already manned and firing. The gun punched holes through the destroyer's plating that set some petrol tanks on the deck afire and disabled 'A' gun. It also claimed the only Canadian casualty during the engagement: Ordinary Seaman Kenneth [...] "Wiley" [...] Watson from Revelestoke, British Columbia. The destroyer was unable to ram U-210 until the rear 4.7-inch gun hit the conning tower, killing the entire bridge crew and the [...]50-caliber machine guns were able to silence the flak gun. This caused Lieutenant <b>Sorber,</b> the senior surviving officer, to order the submarine to dive, but this meant {{that she had to}} hold a straight course while doing so. Assiniboine was {{able to take advantage of}} this and rammed U-210 abaft the conning tower whilst she was diving. This caused the electric motors to fail, damaged her propellers and led to water entering the submarine, as a result of which <b>Sorber</b> ordered the ballast tanks to be blown and the submarine abandoned. The destroyer rammed her again when U-210 resurfaced, dropped a pattern of depth charges set to detonate at shallow depth and hit her one more time with a 4.7-inch shell before the submarine finally sank. A number of survivors were rescued by Assiniboine and the British corvette , before the former ship had to head home for repairs as she was taking on water below the waterline. She required nearly two months of repairs at Halifax and was assigned to Escort Group C3 when they were completed on 20 December.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present work {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} of some oil <b>sorbers</b> based on cellulose derivatives to control petroleum oil spills. In this respect, hydroxypropyl cellulose HPC was used to synthesize hydroxypropyl cellulose acrylate HPCA macromonomer by esterification of HPC with acryloyl chloride. Then the produced HPCA monomer was copolymerized with octadecyl acrylate (ODA) {{in the presence of}} two types of crosslinkers to produce oil gel. The chemical structures of both HPC and HPCA were confirmed by using FTIR and 1 HNMR spectroscopic analysis. Whereas the thermal properties of the crosslinked oil absorbents were investigated using TGA. Furthermore, morphological properties of prepared crosslinked copolymers were studied using SEM. Several parameters were considered to evaluate the oil <b>sorbers,</b> such as: monomers feed ratio, type and concentration of the applied crosslinkers. Finally, the swelling efficiency of oil gel was thoroughly investigated in light and heavy oil. It observed that as the octadecyl acrylate content increased the oil absorbency also increased and reached a maximum value at monomer feed ratio 10 / 90 HPCA/ODA. It is found that the maximum oil absorbency measured with MBA at a monomer feed ratio 10 / 90 HPCA/ODA are 29. 7 and 18. 6 g/g for toluene and crude oil, respectively...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a two-year Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Pillared Layered Materials (PLMs) are layered {{inorganic}} ion exchangers propped apart by metal oxide pillars. PLMs have been synthesized to sorb strontium from liquid nuclear wastes. A study that compared over 60 <b>sorbers</b> {{for their ability to}} sorb strontium from Hanford simulants showed that PLMs were the best sorbers; strontium distribution coefficients ({sup Sr}K{sub d}) > 20000 mL/g were obtained. In addition, PLMs showed a high degree of selectivity for strontium over cesium, transition metals, lanthanides and actinides. The sorption of strontium is, however, inhibited by complexants (EDTA); {sup Sr}K{sub d} values drop to 10 {sup 4 } above pH 12.

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical And Electronic Engineering) The {{feasibility}} of various alternative methods for obtaining air conditioning in internal combustion vehicles is examined from literature studies. It is concluded that adsorption cooling which utilises the hot exhaust gases {{appears to be}} the most promising and the combination zeolite-water is chosen for further research. A synopsis {{of the state of the}} art as documented in the literature is given and typical unresolved problems are identified. A description of the basics of adsorption cooling and the properties ofthe material zeolite is elaborated upon. The requirements for a design to be successful is explained. A finite difference computer spreadsheet model is developed to aid in the calculation ofthe heat transfer process that is necessarily part ofthe sorption processes. Laboratory tests on three <b>sorbers</b> of proprietary design are described and the test methods are refined to the point where satisfactory results are obtained. It is concluded from the tests and computer simulations that adsorption cooling as an alternative method of vehicle air conditioning appears a viable proposition, but that further research is required...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recent {{models of}} the {{envelopes}} of seven massive infrared protostars are used to analyze observations of H + 3 absorption and H 13 CO + submillimeter emission lines toward these stars, and to constrain the cosmic-ray ionization rate ζCR. The H 13 CO + gives best-fit values of ζCR = (2. 6 ± 1. 8) × 10 − 17 s− 1, in good agreement with diffuse cloud models and with recent Voyager/Pioneer data but factors of up to 7 lower than found from the H + 3 data. No relation of ζCR with luminosity or total column density is found, so that local (X-ray) ionization and shielding against cosmic rays appear unimportant for these sources. The difference between the H + 3 and H 13 CO + results and the correlation of N(H + 3) with heliocentric distance suggest that intervening clouds contribute significantly to the absorptions in the more distant regions. The most likely ab-H + 3 <b>sorbers</b> are low-density (< ∼ 104 cm− 3) clouds with most carbon in neutral form or in CO...|$|R

40|$|Low {{availability}} of soil phosphorus (P) caused by strong sorption of P {{is a major}} constraint to agricultural production in most South African soils, particularly those from the high rainfall areas. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to investigate whether combined addition of goat manure with inorganic P fertilizers could enhance P availability in some P fixing soils of the Transkei region, South Africa. The study addressed the following specific objectives (i) to assess P sorption capacities and requirements of selected soils and their relationship with selected soil properties and single point sorption test, (ii) to assess the effects of goat manure and lime addition on P sorption properties of selected P fixing soils (iii) to assess the temporal changes in concentration of inorganic and microbial biomass P fractions following application of inorganic fertilizer P with goat manure in a laboratory incubation experiment, and, (iv) to assess the effects of goat manure application with inorganic phosphate on inorganic and microbial biomass P fractions, P uptake and dry matter yield of maize. Sorption maxima (Smax) of seven soils examined ranged from 192. 3 to 909. 1 (mg P kg- 1) and were highly and positively correlated with sorption affinity constant (r = 0. 93, p = 0. 01) and organic C (r = 0. 71, p = 0. 01). The amount of P required for maintaining a soil solution concentration of 0. 2 mg P l- 1 ranged from 2. 1 to 123. 5 mg P kg- 1 soil. Soils collected from Qweqwe (a Cambisol), Qunu (an Acrisol), Ncihane (a Luvisol) and Bethania (a Ferralsol) had lower external P requirement values and were classified as lower <b>sorbers,</b> whereas soils from Ntlonyana (a Planosol), Chevy Chase (a Ferralsol) and Flagstaff (a Ferralsol) were classified as moderate <b>sorbers.</b> The results suggested that P availability could be compromised in 43 percent iii of the soils studied and that measures to mitigate the adverse effects of P sorption were needed to ensure that P is not a limiting factor to crop production, where such soils are found. Goat manure addition at varying rates (5, 10 and 20 tha- 1 dry weight basis) to two of the moderately P fixing soils from Chevy Chase and Flagstaff, reduced P sorption maxima (Smax) compared to the control treatment. Phosphate sorption decreased with increasing amounts of goat manure in both soils but the extent of reduction was greater on Chevy Chase soil than on Flagstaff soil. The relative liming effects of the different rates of goat manure followed the order 20 t GM ha- 1 > 10 t GM ha- 1 > 5 t GM ha- 1. In a separate experiment, addition of inorganic P at varying rates (0, 90, 180, and 360 kg P ha- 1) to Flagstaff soil increased labile P fractions (resin P, biomass P and NaHCO 3 -Pi) and the increases were greater when goat manure was co-applied. The control treatments contained only 17. 2 and 27. 5 mg P kg- 1 of resin extractable P in the un-amended and manure amended treatments, respectively which increased to 118. 2 and 122. 7 mg P kg- 1 on day 28 of incubation. Biomass P concentration was increased from 16. 8 to 43. 9 mg P kg- 1 in P alone treatments but the fraction was greatly enhanced with manure addition, increasing it from 32. 6 to 97. 7 mg P kg- 1. NaOH-Pi was the largest extractable Pi fraction and ranged from 144. 3 to 250. 6 mg P kg- 1 and 107. 5 to 213. 2 mg P kg- 1 in the unamended and manure amended treatments, respectively. Dry matter yield and P uptake by maize grown in the glasshouse were highly and significantly (p = 0. 05) correlated with the different P fractions in the soil. The correlations followed the order resin P (r = 0. 85) > NaOH-Pi (r = 0. 85) > NaHCO 3 -Pi (r = 0. 84) >> biomass P (r = 0. 56) for dry matter yield at 6 weeks after planting. At 12 weeks after planting, goat manure had iv highly significant effects on resin P and biomass P but had no effect on NaHCO 3 -Pi and NaOH–Pi. The combination of biomass P, resin P and NaHCO 3 -Pi explained 75. 8 percent of the variation in dry matter yield of which 63. 0 percent of the variation was explained by biomass P alone. The greatest increase in biomass P occurred when added P was co-applied with 5 or 10 tha- 1 goat manure. The predictive equation for maize dry matter yield (DM) was: DM (g) = 1. 897 biomass P + 0. 645 resin P (r = 0. 73). Resin P was the fraction that was most depleted due to plant uptake and decreased by 56 to 68 percent between the 6 th week and the 12 th week of sampling indicating that it played a greater role in supplying plant available P. The results therefore suggested that the use of goat manure may allow resource poor farmers to use lower levels of commercial phosphate fertilizers because of its effect to reduce soil P sorption. In addition, higher increases in biomass P due to manure addition observed at lower rates of added P indicated that goat manure has potential for enhancing bioavailability and fertilizer use efficiency of small inorganic P application...|$|R
