5|$|Back at {{the house}} her odd {{behaviour}} continued; most notably she offered the men cigarettes, only to quickly snatch {{them out of their}} mouths as the men smoked them, claiming the cigarettes to be poisoned. She was also carrying multiple mobile phones, as well as a laptop. <b>She</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paranoid and constantly looked out of the windows; this behaviour caused Molloy to assume that she had run away from an abusive partner. Shortly before midnight Molloy left the two, and Sabina stayed the night in Hollinshead's home.|$|E

25|$|Paris {{returned}} to commercial service and in December rescued 22 of 23 seaman aboard the British Vindobala before the tanker sank during a bad winter storm. While westbound on 2 May 1899, Paris ran aground {{in the fog}} on the Manacles off of the coast of Cornwall. At first, <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a total loss and was not refloated for two months. After she was pulled from the rocks, the badly damaged ship was rebuilt at Belfast, Ireland, receiving new engines and having her triple smokestacks replaced {{by a pair of}} taller ones. Renamed Philadelphia, she finally resumed North Atlantic passenger service in August 1901.|$|E
25|$|After an {{impressive}} 2002 season, O'Sullivan had a disappointing 2003. She started {{well with a}} win at the newly inaugurated Great Ireland Run, but she struggled during the summer Grand Prix races. However, <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> finding her form {{at the right time}} when she ran a season's best in the 3000 m in Zurich in a time of 8:37.55 on 15 August. At the World Championships in Paris later that month she was considered a possible medalist. She qualified very comfortably from her heat. However, in the final she finished last of the 15 starters. In December she finished {{an impressive}} fourth at the European Cross-Country Championships, and lead Ireland to silver in the team event.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, a 9-1-1 {{call was}} made by someone {{who claimed to be}} Locklear's doctor, who said that Locklear was trying to commit suicide. Emergency {{responders}} were dispatched to Locklear's home. Her publicist later said that Locklear had never requested any medical assistance and the Ventura County Sheriff's Department later stated that no further action was taken once they arrived at Locklear's Westlake Village home, as <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fine. They did, however, state that they believed the call to be genuine. On June 24, 2008, she checked into a medical facility in Arizona for psychological ailments including anxiety and depression, and requested an in-depth evaluation of her medication to receive proper diagnosis and treatment. Her agent confirmed that she was suffering from anxiety and depression. On July 23, 2008, Locklear returned home after four weeks of treatment at the facility.|$|E

500|$|Authorities {{originally}} {{estimated that}} the girl had died within days of her discovery. Later developments in the case have suggested that Bella's body had been [...] "hidden in a fridge" [...] {{for as long as}} one month before it was deposited on Deer Island. Despite the fact that <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deceased a short amount of time, she had already begun to decompose and become bloated, and so was impossible to identify visually. Decomposition had also made it impossible to collect fingerprints, due to exposure to the water. Investigators were able to conclude that she was a young child but were initially unsure of her race and ethnicity.|$|E
500|$|In her old age Matilda paid {{increasing}} {{attention to}} Church affairs and her personal faith, although she remained involved in governing Normandy throughout her life. Matilda {{appears to have}} had particular fondness for her youngest son William. She opposed Henry's proposal in 1155 to invade Ireland and give the lands to William, however, possibly {{on the grounds that}} the project was impractical, and instead William received large grants of land in England. Matilda was more easy-going in her later life than in her youth, but the chronicler of Mont St Jacques, who met her during this period, still felt that <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "of the stock of tyrants".|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast on November 19, 2009, [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] {{was seen by}} 4.61 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] drew a 2.0 rating/6 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49. It constituted about a five percent drop in viewership from the previous week's episode, [...] "The Camel", which itself was a five percent drop from the previous episode, [...] "Ron and Tammy". The episode received generally positive [...] reviews, with several particularly praising the subplot between Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt. Reviewers also praised the continued developed of the Leslie Knope character, who proves to be intelligent and capable in [...] "Hunting Trip", rather than the clueless protagonist <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in earlier episodes. In 2011, New York magazine writer called it [...] "one of the breakout episodes that saw the show finding its momentum and {{figuring out how to}} transfer the dynamic outside of the office".|$|E

500|$|Max {{has been}} cited as a feminist {{character}} and is considered a symbol of female empowerment. Writing for the University of Melbourne, Bronwen Auty considered Max to be the [...] "archetypal modern feminist hero – a young woman empowered to use her body actively to achieve goals", citing Max's refusal to use firearms and instead using martial arts and knowledge as weapons as contributing to this status. Writing in Science Fiction Film & Television, Clarice Butkus noted Max has been considered a [...] "distinctly millennial post-third-wave feminist warrior, and considered Max's relationship and dialogue with Original Cindy, an African American lesbian, to convey female empowerment. For example Cindy encourages Max not to feel guilt over her sexual behaviour and instead to embrace a traditionally masculine approach to sex. Writing in Reconstruction: Studies in Contemporary Culture, Lorna Jowett also considered Max an example of female empowerment, saying <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the [...] "usual postmodern, postfeminist representation of the female action hero" [...] who displayed mixtures and reversals of traditional gender traits.|$|E
500|$|A {{few moments}} after {{beginning}} the display, and while still ascending, the balloon {{was seen to}} be in flames. Some reports say that the balloon momentarily disappeared behind a cloud and that when it reappeared it was on fire—whatever the circumstances, the gas in the balloon was burning. Blanchard began to descend rapidly, but the balloon, caught in the wind, continued to move off from the pleasure gardens even as it went down. Some spectators thought these events {{were part of the}} show and applauded and shouted their approval. The balloon had not risen very high and, although the escaping gas was burning, the gas within the balloon maintained sufficient lift for a while to prevent the craft plummeting directly to the ground. By rapidly shedding ballast Blanchard was able to slow the descent. Most reports say <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> calm during the descent, but she was said to be wringing her hands in despair as the craft approached the ground. Rumours later circulated that she had gripped the chair of her craft so tightly that [...] "several arteries had snapt through the effort." ...|$|E

It followed the pattern of her previous cup-winning campaign, though <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> racing better than before. A close second in the Group 2 John F Feehan Stakes over [...] at Moonee Valley showed her competitiveness in shorter races. In the 2004 Caulfield Cup, Makybe Diva drew barrier 18 and settled {{at the back of the}} field. She was narrowly defeated by Elvstroem, that led all the way.|$|E
2500|$|One famous Han dynasty dancer is Zhao Feiyan, a {{great beauty}} who rose from a humble {{beginning}} {{to become an}} Empress. She was named Feiyan or [...] "Flying Swallow" [...] after her slender figure and lithe dance steps, so light that <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quivering like a flower in the hand. Professional dancers of the period were of low social status and many entered the profession through poverty, although some such as Zhao Feiyan achieved higher status by becoming concubines.

2500|$|Detectives Joseph, Komorous, and Sheehan {{accompanied}} Frank Paroubek in {{his search}} for the departed wagon which was initially believed to be headed for Round Lake, Illinois, a village about 50 miles northwest of Chicago, where seven wagons were camped. Farmers in the area were alerted to be on watch. When local residents started asking [...] "gypsies" [...] about Elsie and attempting to search the wagons, they broke camp again {{and moved on to}} Volo, Illinois, 43 miles from Chicago. Volo residents reported a child matching Elsie's description and said <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "stupefied" [...] or [...] "drugged" [...] and partly covered with a blanket. They also attempted to search the wagons, but the [...] "gypsies" [...] immediately broke camp and departed for McHenry, Illinois, about 60 miles northwest of Chicago. When police caught up with them at McHenry, they discovered the little girl was a [...] "gypsy" [...] and did not match Elsie's description. Meanwhile, Police Capt. Mahoney assigned men to drag the drainage canals near Elsie's home on April 12th and again on the 15th.|$|E

2500|$|Bathsheba at Her Bath is a reinterpretation of two antique reliefs {{familiar}} to Rembrandt through engravings. A print by Tobias Stimmer {{may have been}} influential, as it includes the pillar, a curtain drawn across the background and Bathsheba's downcast gaze. It was begun around 1647 and altered and repainted until its completion in 1654. Originally the canvas may have been larger and of a vertical format. It might have been trimmed some ten centimeters at the left and at least 20 centimeters in height; It is speculated that Rembrandt cut the canvas himself in order to intensify {{the impact of the}} figure. [...] show that at some point late in the painting process, he lowered Bathsheba's head from its initial more upward angle, thereby increasing the sense of the figure's withdrawal into reverie. Initially <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> looking {{out of the corner of}} her eye, as if watching David; in the present version her gaze is softened, in the general direction of her maid but focused on no particular object, imparting a feeling of solemnity and contemplation. There was no letter in her hand in the original conception, and it is also possible that her lap, thighs, and right arm were once draped.|$|E
2500|$|Time Charter's {{training}} {{in the early part}} of 1984 was disrupted by a hip injury and she began her final season in the Coronation Cup at Epsom in June. She was matched for the third time against Sun Princess, with the other runners including Shearwalk (third in the Epsom Derby) and the top-class Irish filly Flame of Tara. Ridden by Steve Cauthen, she produced what was described as a [...] "breathtaking performance", travelling very easily throughout the race before sprinting clear of her rivals in the final furlong to win by four lengths from Sun Princess. Time Charter was unable to add to her success in her three remaining races. At Sandown in July <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an unlucky loser in the Eclipse Stakes, failing to obtain a clear run in the straight and finishing very strongly to take second place, a neck behind Sadler's Wells. In the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes later that month she ran well, but never looked likely to repeat her 1983 victory finishing fourth behind Teenoso, Sadler's Wells and Tolomeo. Time Charter suffered from a [...] "runny nose" [...] in September, and on her final racecourse appearance she made little impact, finishing eleventh behind Sagace in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.|$|E
2500|$|In their {{review of}} the fourth series, Digital Spy opined [...] "At the core was Catherine Tate's {{excellent}} performance as Donna Noble, epitomising the intricate fusion of fun, adventure, sadness {{and a desire to}} belong." [...] Digital Spy noted that fans initially worried about Tate's full-time casting, as she is known for her role as a comedian and comic actor. They attributed the character's success to the modification of the much more brash and boisterous character <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in [...] "The Runaway Bride". The character's comedic elements continued ("the occasional... misfire") in the form of her tendency to shout, but Digital Spy was praising of many of the character's comedic moments. They praised more highly Tate's crying scenes in [...] "The Fires of Pompeii", which [...] "gave the visually impressive episode much-needed depth", as well as her sensitivity and emotionality at the mistreatment of the alien Ood in [...] "Planet of the Ood". Cult Editor Ben Rawson-Jones also praised the character's [...] "tragic" [...] scenes, such as losing her fake children and ideal man in [...] "Forest of the Dead", and the [...] "emotional wringer" [...] of Donna-centric episode [...] "Turn Left". Donna was voted the second best companion of all time in Doctor Who Magazine Issue 414 and Issue 474, and came second place in WatchMojo.com's Top Ten Doctor Who Companions list.|$|E
