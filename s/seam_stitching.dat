40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The major {{purposes}} of the research were {{to determine whether there}} were significant differences in breaking strength and elongation of the following types of seams in a polyester double-knit fabric: 1. <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with threads of (a) mercerized cotton, (b) core-spun polyester/cotton, and (c) bonded nylon monocord. 2. <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with (a) a narrow zigzag stitch, (b) a lockstitch made while stretching the fabric, and (c) an elastic straight <b>stitch.</b> 3. <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> (a) parallel to the wales and (b) parallel to the courses. 4. <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with settings of (a) 9 stitches per inch, (b) 12 stitches per inch, and (c) 15 stitches per inch. Results indicated that the polyester/cotton core-spun thread produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than mercerized cotton thread for all comparable sets of specimens. Seams constructed with polyester/cotton core-spun thread also tended to exhibit greater seam breaking strength and elongation than those seamed with bonded nylon monocord thread. The nylon thread, in turn, tended to produce stronger and more extensible seams than did mercerized cotton thread. The elastic straight stitch (a triple lockstitch) produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than either of the other <b>stitch</b> types. Most <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with the lockstitch with stretch had a higher mean seam breaking strength and elongation than comparable <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with the zigzag stitch, <b>Stitch</b> length affected <b>seam</b> breaking strength and elongation to a greater extent with the zigzag than with the lockstitch with stretch. For most comparable sets of zigzag specimens, increases in the number of stitches per inch were accompanied by increases in seam breaking strength and elongation. With the lockstitch, those differences which were significant indicated that the shorter stitches were related to greater breaking strength and elongation. Seams parallel to the courses were related to greater seam breaking strength and elongation than seams parallel to the wales...|$|R

40|$|Drape of {{the fabric}} {{is its ability to}} hang freely in graceful folds when some area of it is {{supported}} over a surface and the rest is unsupported. Drape is a unique property that allows a fabric to be bent in more than in one direction, When two-dimensional fabric are converted to three-dimensional garment form. In the present study, the effects of sewing of different seam were selected on different fabric and their behaviors were studied. In this study drape of ten fabrics are analyzed with three types of <b>seams</b> and three <b>stitch</b> densities. Sample without seam is a control sample and drape of seamed samples are compared with control sample to analyse the drape behavior of seamed fabrics. This paper presents a fundamental drape analysis of seamed fabrics using drape meter. Drape behavior is determined in terms of drape coefficient. The effect of seams on the drape coefficient and Drape profile has been made. Drape coefficients significantly differs between the fabrics and also between the <b>seam</b> <b>stitch</b> density combinations. Investigating drape on seamed fabrics can improve fabric end use application. Coppright © IAARR, 2009 : www. afrrevjo. com 6...|$|R

From Donna Franklin’s red silk and fungi dress designed and grown during a residency at Symbiotica in Perth, Western Australia to the bone cell wedding rings grown to measure by the biojewellery project in London, couture may finally be witnessing its twilight. It {{will be replaced by}} no less discerning a costumer, just one that happens to think that clothes and accessories grown to size are a sensible thing. Tobie Kerridge and Nikki Stott, design researchers at the Royal College of Art, and Ian Thompson, a bioengineer at Kings College London explain that biojewellery’s “aim is to bring the medical and technical processes of bioengineering out of the lab and into the public arena. ” In the process, volunteers harvest their own bone cells to “grow” wedding bands for each other, giving a whole new meaning to material union. On {{the other side of the}} globe, Tissue Culture and Art’s “Victimless Leather” project suggests that the future of the garment could lie in one grown to measure from cells, rather than woven and stitched from cloth. And Suzanne Lee, author of Fashioning the Future is currently collaborating with the material scientist David Hepworth, on a research project to investigate grown materials as alternative textiles. Why? Asking our clothing to change, rather than fashion’s ongoing demand that we change our clothing is, Lee asserts, “a logical conclusion to fashion’s pace. ” Curiously, while single step production for garments may be our future, a garment without <b>seams,</b> <b>stitches</b> or cloth would herald the end of crafts such as weaving and tailoring. Eventually, such developments could be responsible for the extinction of a species already on the endangered list: the craftsperson...|$|R

40|$|A stereo {{infinite}} panorama is {{a panoramic}} image {{that may be}} in-finitely extended by continuously stitching together stereo images that depict similar scenes, but are taken from different geographic locations. It {{can be used to}} create interesting walkthrough environ-ment. An important issue underlying this application is to seam-lessly stitch two stereo images together. Although many methods have been proposed for stitching 2 D images, they may not work well on stereo images, due to the difficulty in ensuring disparity consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel method to stitch two stereo images seamlessly. We first apply the graph cut algorithm to compute a <b>seam</b> for <b>stitching,</b> with a novel disparity-aware energy function to both ensure disparity continuity and suppress visual ar-tifacts around the seam. We then apply a modified warping-based disparity scaling algorithm to suppress the seam in depth domain.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} creating high-resolution and high-quality panoramic images from long image sequences with very different colors and luminance in source images. A fast stitching approach is proposed for combining a set of source images into a panoramic image using little memory, and implemented on mobile phones. In this approach, color correction reduces color differences of source images and balances colors and luminance in the whole image sequence, dynamic programming finds optimal seams in overlapping areas between adjacent images and merges them together, and image blending further smoothens color transitions and hides visible <b>seams</b> and <b>stitching</b> artifacts. A sequential panorama stitching procedure constructs panoramic images. The advantages include fast processing speed using dynamic programming for optimal seam finding, reducing memory needs by using the sequential panorama stitching, and improved quality of image labeling and blending due {{to the use of}} color correction. The approach has been tested with different image sequences and it works well on both indoor and outdoor scenes 1. Index Terms — Mobile panorama, image stitching, fast labeling, image blending...|$|R
