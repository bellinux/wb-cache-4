40|$|Washington {{courts are}} free to enforce publicland use servitudes. Of the {{elements}} required for a servitude to run with the land, form, notice, and touch and concern on the burden side do not bar running. Only the touch and concern element applied on the benefit side is a potential bar. Washington conceivably could allow public land use servitudes to run with the land by following the minority position of not requiring touch and concern on the benefit side. A less stringent theory, however, is available to enforce public land use servitudes. Washington has not adopted a rule that public servitudes are always in gross when government does not directly own benefited land. Therefore, the courts {{are free to}} require touch and concern on the benefit side while recognizing that the requirement is met when the promise benefits land, regardless of ownership. Based on their past record, Washington courts probably will enforce public land use servitudes. The courts have recognized and responded {{to the need for}} land use control to manage growth and development in the state, thereby furthering both public zoning and private <b>subdivision</b> <b>regulation.</b> Accordingly, to be consistent, the courts must enforce public land use servitudes...|$|E

This has caused confusion about the approval process and regulatory requirements as well as delays in application processing. This Professional Project will explore the opportunity for the City to adopt a subdivision ordinance that would provide direction for subdivision design and approval and further the City’s smart growth and sustainability policies. However, there would need to be careful consideration for the potential increase in costs that are associated with additional fees or off-site improvement requirements. The Subdivision Ordinance would be written with the goals of achieving a streamlined process and incorporating design standards consistent with smart growth principles and sustainability consistent with the City’s Sustainability Plan. In addition, the Subdivision Ordinance must be consistent with the goals, policies, and programs of the City of South Lake Tahoe General Plan.

40|$|Montgomery County, Maryland has an Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO) that {{requires}} the county’s Planning Board to determine that available or programmed transportation facilities can accommodate the peak-period trips that a proposed residential or commercial subdivision will generate before they can approve that subdivision. This requirement generates nearly continuous discussion among policy makers, residents, property developers, and other interest groups {{about what it means}} for a transportation system to be adequate. Since 2007, the county’s biennial growth policy has addressed that issue with a measure called Policy Area Mobility Review (PAMR). The review uses a regional travel-demand model to consider current and future system performance across 32 policy areas that range in size from ten to thirty square miles. The PAMR analysis integrates transit system and roadway system mobility measures, incorporating a county policy that transportation-system equity can be maintained by allowing more congestion in areas with better transit service. The regional nature of the PAMR analysis provides geographic and analytic capabilities beyond the typical traffic-impact study. The Montgomery County Planning Board (MCPB) uses PAMR for both near-term <b>subdivision</b> <b>regulation</b> for compliance with the APFO and long-term master-planning purposes. These characteristics of the PAMR application, plus context-sensitive development-mitigation approaches including peak-hour vehicle trip-reduction measures, additional public transit capacity, and nonautomobile-transportation facilities, help improve the sustainability of new development. This article describes how PAMR has worked and the issues its use has generated in integrating sustainability into the transportation-planning process...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the subdivision in urban areas is to constitute the healthy urban structure, to provide land development and to regulate the use of private and public land for public interest. The other important objective is to prevent sprawl of city and chaotic growth. Especially, subdivision is an important tool for applying of physical planning decisions into urban space in Turkey. Municipalities {{are responsible for the}} application of land subdivision according to detailed urban plans except a voluntary basis through agreements according to civil law. But there is lack of sufficient research related to realizing of subdivision in urban spaces throughout the Turkey. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to determine whether there is a difference in realizing of subdivision according to detailed planning decisions between urban areas in different population groups. The additional purpose of this paper is to constitute a model concerning application of subdivision according to detailed urban planning for urban areas in different population groups in Turkey and then to compare each of these city groups. For this research, a sample survey method is used and 480 questionnaires are completed by Planning Office of the Municipalities of urban areas in different population groups. In this model the realizing of subdivision index (RSI) are used as a dependent variable and population, population growth ate, global density in urban areas according to detailed plans, Municipal budgets, socio-economic index, the average of land values of cities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} residential land subdivision regulations in Connecticut, and {{is divided into three}} parts. First of ·these is the model itself, a contemporary prescription for the governmental regulation of land subdivision. It is rather comprehensive and lengthy by design, for a model of this grain should be available not only for reproduction, but for abridgement as well. Second is a discussion of ·the unmet needs and problematic symptoms of residential land subdivision, and a defense for correcting the very problem of inadequate regulations and administration through the formulation of the model. Third and finally is a section by section narrative keyed to the model in which the reader is offered an elaboration on the regulations. This is particularly directed towards the rationale behind them, the alternative available to them, and necessary administrative measures to ensure a manageable review process. One parting note of limitation; these regulations were formulated relative to standard municipal staffing requirements, including a Town Planner, a clerk to the Planning Commission, a Town Engineer, a Zoning Enforcement Officer, and a Building Official. To the author 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge, each of Connecticut 2 ̆ 7 s 169 towns has the services of a Building Official and a clerk to the Planning Commission, even if available only on a part-time basis. For those seven towns in which zoning has not been instituted and thus no zoning enforcement officer is available, {{as is the case in}} four of rural northeastern Connecticut 2 ̆ 7 s communities, all references to the zoning official or zoning itself should be omitted.

Microbial pathogens) or long exposures (eg. Many chemical). Safe drinking water supply and basic sanitation are vital human needs for health and proclivity. All the health,ill-health, disease and death in developing nations are attributed {{to the lack of}} these essentials. According to WHO; about 30000 people die every day in the world due to unsafe water consumption and insufficient sanitation. (environmental sanitation 2001) Tens of millions of women spend half of their day walking in hot sun to carry home polluted water which poisons them and their families. Etymologically the word sanitation is from French sanitas, which means health. Thus environmental sanitation is an act or process of making the environment sanitary, health or hygienic. Various definitions of sanitation given by the National Sanitation foundation of U. S A is follows;“Sanitation is away of life. It is quality of living that is expressed in the clean community. Being the way of life,it must come from within the people, it is nourished by knowledge and grows as an obligation and an ideal in human relation”. The WHO defines environmental sanitation as “ the control of all those factors in mans physical environment which exercise or may exercise a deleterious effect on his physical development, health and survival. the design construction and management of water supply and wastewater disposal schemes can be associated with the growth of capital cities and commercial centers {{that took place in the}} wake of the industrial revolution of 19 th century.

40|$|Abstract. The {{public sector}} {{constrains}} {{the size and}} shape of lots and buildings via zoning ordinances and <b>subdivision</b> <b>regulations.</b> Zoning ordinances utilize setback requirements, open space ratios, minimum lot area and floor-to-area ratios. <b>Subdivision</b> <b>regulations</b> utilize street and sidewalk spacing requirments. This article provides a framework in which one can analyze the precise impact of these control devices. The choice of developers who face these controls is discussed in terms of a rule of thumb and in terms of a model of profit maximization. Zoning, subdivision and similar ordinances limit private property rights and constrain choice regarding the configurations of houses and lots. Such ordinances are both widespread and amazingly homogeneous across the United States. Thus, analyzing aspects of one particular set of land use control ordinances allows implications to be drawn for ordinances in a wide variety of cities. This article analyzes the impact of zoning and subdivision ordinances upon the feasible choices for residential lot and building configurations in one particular municipality. This analysis is but one of the pieces needed for a comprehensive theory of optima...|$|R

40|$|Descended from slaves {{brought to}} the {{southeast}} United States between the early 17 th and mid 19 th centuries, the Gullah-Geechee of South Carolina and Georgia in the United States, have developed distinctive, culturally-expressive creole communities. Juxtaposed against their ancestor’s plantation slave villages, present-day settlements reveal deliberate creations of community and strong connections to place. The Gullah concept of place and community also includes {{an understanding of the}} land as commons that is at odds with the dominant culture in the United States. Under slavery the Gullah lived in rigidly geometric settlements. Although this was the only settlement pattern the slaves had experienced, within the space of two generations after emancipation (post- 1865) community forms transitioned to organic, roughly circular settlements based on family relationships. These settlements were held as common land, and {{over the course of several}} generations, the communities were owned in common by descendants at times numbering in the hundreds. Given the realities of US property law, this left the Gullah communities vulnerable to takeover by outsiders who capitalized on the weaknesses of the Gullah system of heirs property. This paper looks at the concept of the common in Gullah tradition, and the effect that the legal system has on this cultural practice. While clearing title was one approach widely adopted for community protection, the form and pattern of the Gullah communities remained at odds with zoning and <b>subdivision</b> <b>regulations.</b> Adherence to a zoning and subdivision scheme are both required for the deeds and mortgages necessary for building new homes in the communities, therefore 15 years ago Gullah-specific zoning and <b>subdivision</b> <b>regulations</b> were adopted.
