5|$|Prey may {{be crushed}} to death if large or eaten alive if small, <b>swallowed</b> head-first, and helped down by muscular contractions and neck flexing. Unusually, after food has been <b>swallowed,</b> the Gila monster {{immediately}} resumes tongue flicking and search behavior, probably {{as a result}} of a history of finding clumped prey such as eggs and young in nests. Gila monsters are able to climb trees and cacti in search of eggs.|$|E
5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when <b>swallowed</b> passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being <b>swallowed,</b> the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E

40|$|Eight {{members of}} the <b>swallow</b> family Hirundinidae breed in North America: the tree <b>swallow</b> (Tachycineta bicolor), violet-green <b>swallow</b> (Tachycineta thalassina), purple martin (Progne subis), bank <b>swallow</b> (Riparia riparia), {{northern}} rough-winged <b>swallow</b> (Stelgidopteryx serripennis), barn <b>swallow</b> (Hirundo rustica), cave <b>swallow</b> (Hirundo fulva), and the cliff <b>swallow</b> (Hirundo pyrrhonota). Cliff and barn <b>swallows</b> are found throughout most of North America. Four basic conditions are found near most cliff and barn <b>swallow</b> nest sites: (1) an open habitat for foraging, (2) a suitable surface for nest attachment beneath an overhang or ledge, (3) a supply of mud of the proper consistency for nest building, and (4) a body of fresh water for drinking. All <b>swallows</b> are insectivores, catching a variety of insects. Cliff and barn <b>swallows</b> winter in South America. <b>Swallows</b> have a homing tendency toward previous nesting sites. Cliff <b>swallow</b> nests are gourd-shaped, enclosed structures with an entrance tunnel that opens downward. Cliff <b>swallows</b> usually begin laying eggs before the entrance tunnel is completed.

40|$|Rationale: <b>Swallowing</b> during {{inspiration}} and <b>swallowing</b> immediately followed by inspiration {{increase the chances}} of aspiration and may cause disease exacerbation. However, the mechanisms by which such breathing–swallowing discoordination occurs are not well-understood. Objectives: We hypothesized that breathing–swallowing discoordination occurs when {{the timing of the}} <b>swallow</b> in the respiratory cycle is inappropriate. To test this hypothesis, we monitored respiration and <b>swallowing</b> activity in healthy subjects and in patients with dysphagia using a non-invasive <b>swallowing</b> monitoring system. Measurements and Main Results: The parameters measured included the timing of <b>swallow</b> in the respiratory cycle, <b>swallowing</b> latency (interval between the onset of respiratory pause and the onset of <b>swallow),</b> pause duration (duration of respiratory pause for <b>swallowing),</b> and the breathing–swallowing coordination pattern. We classified <b>swallows</b> that closely follow inspiration (I) as I-SW, whereas those that precede I as SW-I pattern. Patients with dysphagia had prolonged <b>swallowing</b> latency and pause duration, and tended to have I-SW or SW-I patterns reflecting breathing–swallows discoordination. Conclusions: We conclude that <b>swallows</b> at inappropriate timing in the respiratory cycle cause breathing–swallowing discoordination, and the prolongation of <b>swallowing</b> latency leads to delayed timing of the <b>swallow,</b> and results in an increase in the SW-I pattern in patients with dysphagia...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Developing an {{automated}} diagnostic and therapeutic instrument for treating <b>swallowing</b> disorders requires procedures able to reliably detect and evaluate a <b>swallow.</b> We tested a two-stage detection procedure {{based on a}} combined electromyography/bioimpedance (EMBI) measurement system. EMBI is able to detect <b>swallows</b> and distinguish them from similar movements in healthy test subjects. Study Design. The study was planned and conducted as a case-control study (EA 1 / 019 / 10, and EA 1 / 160 / 09, EA 1 / 161 / 09). Method. The study looked at differences in <b>swallowing</b> parameters in general and {{in the event of}} penetration during <b>swallows</b> in healthy subjects and in patients with an oropharyngeal <b>swallowing</b> disorder. A two-stage automated <b>swallow</b> detection procedure which used electromyography (EMG) and bioimpedance (BI) to reliably detect <b>swallows</b> was developed. Results. Statistically significant differences between healthy subjects and patients with a <b>swallowing</b> disorder were found in <b>swallowing</b> parameters previously used to distinguish between <b>swallowing</b> and head movements. Our two-stage algorithm was able to reliably detect <b>swallows</b> (sensitivity = 96. 1 %, specificity = 97. 1 %) {{on the basis of these}} differences. Discussion. Using a two-stage detection procedure, the EMBI measurement procedure is able to detect and evaluate <b>swallows</b> automatically and reliably. The two procedures (EMBI + <b>swallow</b> detection) could in future form the basis for automated diagnosis and treatment (stimulation) of <b>swallowing</b> disorders...|$|R
40|$|A timed test of <b>swallowing</b> {{capacity}} {{has been}} designed for use in patients with neurogenic dysphagia. <b>Swallowing</b> speed (ml/s) has been demonstrated to have high intra- and inter- rater and test- retest reliability, and to be essentially independent of flavour or temperature. "Guideline" normal values were established in individuals without a <b>swallowing</b> disorder: <b>swallowing</b> speed was less in females than males and declined in both groups with age. The validity of a <b>swallowing</b> speed less than 10 ml/s as an index of abnormal <b>swallowing</b> was tested by comparison with the complaint of abnormal <b>swallowing</b> {{in a group of}} 81 neurological patients. <b>Swallowing</b> speed had a sensitivity of 96 % and specificity of 69 %: some apparent false positive responses were found in patients with disordered <b>swallowing,</b> mainly due to multiple sclerosis. Using a standard questionnaire and examination a similar pattern of symptoms and signs were statistically associated with both the clinical complaint of abnormal <b>swallowing</b> and <b>swallowing</b> speed. It is concluded that <b>swallowing</b> speed is a reliable and valid index for assessing disordered <b>swallowing</b> in neurological patients and may be of value in monitoring response to therapy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Background. After {{radiotherapy}} to {{the head}} and neck, many patients experience <b>swallowing</b> difficulties. Prelimi-nary work indicates that these patients benefit from the super-supraglottic <b>swallow</b> maneuver. Methods. Lateral videofluoroscopic studies examined oropha-ryngeal <b>swallowing</b> in 9 patients who suffered from dysphagia after radiation {{to the head}} and neck. Each patient completed two <b>swallows</b> each of 1 mL or 3 mL liquid barium without a voluntary <b>swallow</b> maneuver and with the super-supraglottic <b>swallow</b> de-signed to close {{the entrance to the}} airway early. The videotape of each <b>swallow</b> was digitized and the location of pharyngeal struc-tures marked throughout the <b>swallow.</b> Movement over time plots were generated to measure changes in structural movement re-sulting from the maneuver. Results. The super-supraglottic <b>swallow</b> resulted in changes in airway entrance closure and hyolaryngeal movement. One pa-tient who aspirated without the maneuver stopped aspirating with the maneuver. Two others had aspiration reduced to a trace with the maneuver. Fewer <b>swallow</b> disorders were observed with the maneuver. Conclusion.

40|$|Background: <b>Swallowing</b> {{changes are}} common in Parkinson′s disease (PD). Early {{identification}} is essential to avoid complications of aspiration. Objectives: To evaluate the <b>swallowing</b> ability of the PD patients and to correlate it with the indicators of disease progression. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 PD patients (70 males and 30 females) aged between 50 years and 70 years with varying stage, duration, and severity were enrolled in a cross-sectional study carried out between January and May 2012. A simple bedside water <b>swallowing</b> test was performed using standard 150 ml of water. <b>Swallowing</b> process was assessed under three categories-swallowing speeds (ml/s), <b>swallowing</b> volume (ml/swallow) and <b>swallowing</b> duration (s/swallow). Equal number of age and sex matched controls were also evaluated. Results: All of them completed the task of <b>swallowing.</b> A mean <b>swallowing</b> speed (27. 48 ml/s), <b>swallowing</b> volume (28. 5 ml/s), and <b>swallowing</b> duration (1. 05 s/swallow) was established by the control group. The PD patients showed decreased <b>swallowing</b> speed (7. 15 ml/s in males and 6. 61 ml/s in females), decreased <b>swallowing</b> volume (14. 59 ml/swallow and 14 ml/swallow in females), and increased <b>swallowing</b> duration (2. 37 s/swallow and 2. 42 s/swallow) which are statistically significant. There was a significant positive correlation between the severity, duration, and staging of the disease with the <b>swallowing</b> performance and a poor correlation between the subjective reports of dysphagia and the objective performance on water <b>swallow</b> test. Conclusion: The water <b>swallowing</b> test is a simple bedside test to identify the <b>swallowing</b> changes early in PD. It is recommended to do the test in all PD Patients to detect dysphagia early and to intervene appropriately...|$|R
