The comments reporting students’ self-perceived benefit {{of the use of}} haptic devices for their learning were grouped into different categories namely positive, negative or suggestion-oriented. Corresponding to the different categories, further <b>sub-categories</b> were assigned based on the similarity of comments. These categories and <b>sub-categories</b> are different for the three charge distributions. Counts for each of the <b>sub-categories</b> were calculated and sample responses were documented corresponding to each of these <b>sub-categories.</b> Finally, students’ {{perceptions of}} the usefulness, ease of use and mental effort were scored on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 [*]=[*]Strong Disagree, 2 [*]=[*]Disagree, 3 [*]=[*]Undecided, 4 [*]=[*]Agree, 5 [*]=[*]Strongly Agree) and average scores and standard deviations were calculated.|$|R

25|$|Originally a <b>sub-category</b> {{of direct}} discrimination, {{harassment}} {{is now an}} independent tort which requires no comparator. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, and now the Equality Act 2010 sections 26 and 40, define harassment as where a person's dignity is violated, or the person is subject to an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. An employer will be liable for its own conduct, but also conduct of employees, or customers if this happens on 2 or more occasions and the employer could be reasonably expected to have intervened. In a straightforward case, in Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust a gay man was ostracised and bossed about by his supervisor {{from the very start}} of his work as a clinical audit co-ordinator. The House of Lords held the laws create a statutory tort, for which (unless a statute says otherwise) an employer is automatically vicariously liable. Under the Equality Act 2010 section 27, an employer must also ensure that once a complaint is brought by a worker, even if it ultimately proves to be unfounded, that worker should not be victimised. This means the worker should not be subject to anything that a reasonable person would perceive as detrimental. In St Helen’s MBC v Derbyshire the House of Lords held a council victimised female staff who were pursuing an equal pay claim when it sent letters warning (without much factual basis) that if the claim went ahead, the council would be forced to cut school dinners and make redundancies. Because it attempted to make the workers feel guilty, a reasonable person would have regarded this as a detriment. By contrast, in Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police v Khan, a sergeant with a pending race discrimination claim was denied a reference by the employer that he was suing. The House of Lords held this could not be considered victimisation because the Constabulary was only seeking to protect its legitimate interests by not giving a reference, so as to not prejudice its own future case in the discrimination hearings.|$|E

500|$|Depictions of {{metalloids}} {{vary according}} to the author. Some do not classify elements bordering the metal–nonmetal dividing line as metalloids, noting that a binary classification can facilitate the establishment of rules for determining bond types between metals and nonmetals. Metalloids are variously grouped with metals, regarded as nonmetals or treated as a <b>sub-category</b> of nonmetals. Other authors have suggested that classifying some elements as metalloids [...] "emphasizes that properties change gradually rather than abruptly as one moves across or down the periodic table". Some periodic tables distinguish elements that are metalloids and display no formal dividing line between metals and nonmetals. Metalloids are shown as occurring in a diagonal band or diffuse region.|$|E

500|$|The third <b>sub-category</b> covers {{charitable}} trusts for {{the benefit}} of localities. A trust {{for the benefit}} of a locality has long been held only to apply to that area; if its purpose within that area is charitable, it is valid. If the money is to be spent on non-charitable purposes, the trust fails, regardless {{of the fact that it}} applies to a particular area. This class of charities can be held valid even when it only impacts on a class within a locality, as in Goodman v Saltash Corporation.

500|$|The Type Ia {{supernova}} is a <b>sub-category</b> in the Minkowski-Zwicky supernova classification scheme, {{which was}} devised by German-American astronomer Rudolph Minkowski and Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky. There are several {{means by which}} a supernova of this type can form, but they share a common underlying mechanism. [...] Theoretical astronomers long believed the progenitor star {{for this type of}} supernova is a white dwarf and empirical evidence for this was found in 2014 when a Type Ia supernova was observed in the galaxy Messier 82. [...] When a slowly-rotating carbon-oxygen white dwarf accretes matter from a companion, it can exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of about , beyond which it can no longer support its weight with electron degeneracy pressure. In the absence of a countervailing process, the white dwarf would collapse to form a neutron star, in an accretion-induced non-ejective process, as normally occurs {{in the case of a}} white dwarf that is primarily composed of magnesium, neon, and oxygen.|$|E

500|$|In the {{original}} and Final Mix versions of Kingdom Hearts, the command menu had four commands: Attack, Magic, Items, and a fourth context-sensitive slot that varied depending on what the player had targeted, where they were, etc. The command menu has been updated to include [...] "Attack", [...] "Magic", [...] "Items", and [...] "Summons" [...] in the fourth slot, which was originally located as a <b>sub-category</b> beneath the [...] "Magic" [...] menu. The original fourth command {{has been replaced by}} the introduction of Reaction Commands from Kingdom Hearts II and are triggered by pressing the Triangle Button. The camera works more similarly to that of Kingdom Hearts II, utilizing the right thumb stick to move the camera and allowing the player to click the R3 button to reset the camera behind Sora, as opposed to {{the original}} game which made use of the shoulder triggers L2 and R2 to position the camera. Overall, the gameplay of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was modified so it would play more similarly to Kingdom Hearts II and Re:Chain of Memories, to create a more consistent play style throughout the series.|$|E
500|$|Macnaghten's fourth {{category}} contains {{not only}} individual categories of its own, but also general principles that are applied when a body seeks to be recognised as a charitable trust. The {{first of these}} [...] "sub-categories" [...] contains trusts {{for the benefit of}} the sick and old; the Preamble to the 1601 Act gave [...] "aged, impotent and poor people" [...] as acceptable beneficiaries for a charity. These acceptable beneficiaries are to be read individually; there is no requirement to aid the aged and impotent as well as the poor, and one can even exclude the poor, such as in Re Resch's Will Trusts, which dealt with a hospital that charged fees. The second <b>sub-category</b> is for charitable trusts relating to animals. As with religious charities, the benefit is derived not from the comfort afforded to the animals, but from the [...] "indirect moral benefit to mankind". Again, this excludes trusts which isolate the beneficiaries from the public, as in Re Grove-Grady, where the trust sought to provide [...] "a refuge ... so that they shall be safe from molestation and destruction by man". Charities for the purpose of creating animal sanctuaries usually pass the public benefit test despite this, because they do not completely exclude the public and often have educational value.|$|E

2500|$|Secular humanist {{organizations}} {{are found in}} all parts of the world. Those who call themselves humanists are estimated to number between four and five million people worldwide in 31 countries, but there is uncertainty because of the lack of universal definition throughout censuses. Humanism is a non-theistic belief system and, as such, it could be a <b>sub-category</b> of [...] "Religion" [...] only if that term is defined to mean [...] "Religion and (any) belief system". This is the case in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on freedom of religion and beliefs. Many national censuses contentiously define Humanism as a further <b>sub-category</b> of the <b>sub-category</b> [...] "No Religion", which typically includes atheist, rationalist and agnostic thought. In England, Wales 25% of people specify that they have 'No religion' up from 15% in 2001 and in Australia, around 30% of the population specifies [...] "No Religion" [...] in the national census. In the USA, the decennial census does not inquire about religious affiliation or its lack; surveys report the figure at roughly 13%. In the 2001 Canadian census, 16.5% of the populace reported having no religious affiliation. In the 2011 Scottish census, 37% stated they had no religion up from 28% in 2001. [...] One of the largest Humanist organizations in the world (relative to population) is Norway's Human-Etisk Forbund, which had over 86,000 members out of a population of around 4.6 million in 2013 – approximately 2% of the population.|$|E
