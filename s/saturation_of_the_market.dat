5000|$|Many comic speculators {{who were}} {{only in the}} market to see {{important}} comics mature, then sell them for a tidy profit, didn't quite understand how quick the turn around {{would be on the}} story recant, and many rushed out to scoop up as many copies of whatever issues were to be deemed significant. Comic shops received not only staggering sales during the week that Superman died, but also had to try and meet the demand. This led to the <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and the devaluing of what was thought {{to be the end of}} an American icon. Some comic book retailers and theorists deem DC's practices in the press forum and their relationship with the non-specialized consumer to be grossly negligent of the status of the market, and that their marketing campaign, whereas most likely not malicious in intent, spelled doom for the speculator market and comic sales in general. Others place the blame for the comic market crash on Marvel (whose product line had bloated to hundreds of separate titles by late 1993, including the poorly received [...] "Marvel UK" [...] and [...] "2099" [...] lines) or creator-owned upstart Image Comics (who fed the speculator feeding frenzy more than any other comics publisher).|$|E

At {{the same time}} new information technologies have substituted the traditional production inputs such as labour and thus enabled the more efficient production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> services {{and the increase in}} their use. From <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest industry the most important services for it's competitiveness are engineering services, maintenance services, computer and related services and transportation and logistics. Services are produced by service industries themselves but increasingly also by the forest industry machinery producers, <b>the</b> core business <b>of</b> which is gradually transforming into engineering and maintenance services.

What are the main features of the innovations within the franchising sector? Are there real innovations in the franchising industry as suggested by the franchisors in their advertisement?

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss whether {{insurers}} could have a strong motivation for M&A in the future because they need to survive within the industry under oversaturated market conditions. Recently, Japanese non-life insurance markets, mainly the automobile insurance market, have reached the point of saturation due to the oversaturated domestic automobile market. At that time, the industry has also experienced successive large-scale M&A transactions. Design/methodology/approach – Using a theoretical model developed by Salent et al., the authors discuss whether an insurer's motivation for M&A could be affected by a <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> The authors also clarify whether insurance premium deregulation is a necessary condition for merger incentives. Findings – The authors conclude that, first, necessary requirement for insurers' motivation of consolidations is to loosen the rate regulation; and second, the sufficient condition is saturation of market. Research limitations/implications – This result is intuitive to understand recent circumstances surrounding the Japanese non-life insurance industry. Originality/value – This study is believed to be the first to discuss the relationship between a potential market size and M&A transactions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of price and non-price {{competitiveness}} factors using a relative export price index, introduced by Benkovskis and Wörz (2016), that is adjusted for changes in quality and taste. First, we replicate their model employing an updated dataset, confirming previous results. Then, the framework is used to study the recent developments in the Europe's oil product market. Given the <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> decreasing demand, and converging prices, importance of non-price competitiveness factors, such as quality, increases. The {{results suggest that the}} problems of the underinvested oil downstream industry in Northwestern European producers are caused not only by decreasing aggregate demand, high costs, and low margins, but by non-price competitiveness factors as well. We find profound improvements in product quality in CEE countries, following substantial investments into the sector and market consolidation. Both regions are at risk of rising imports of high-quality products from the Middle East, Russia and USA. This thesis provides a comprehensive picture of price and non-price competitiveness developments of all players in the highly competitive European oil downstream market...|$|E
