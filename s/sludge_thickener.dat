The enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process {{has been shown to be}} an economical and environmentally compatible method for reducing phosphorus from wastewaters. The experiment has been performed in order to investigate the effect of using effective microorganisms (EM) as an application of Enhanced Biological Phosphorous Removal (EBPR) in modified contact stabilization activated sludge system by using contact tank as a phosphorus uptake zone and using thickener tank as a phosphorus release zone.

40|$|Centrifugation of {{activated}} sludge is a frequently used dewatering process {{but there is}} a need for a fitting function for moderate and high sludge concentrations. In particular, liquid phase accumulation kinetics during centrifugation may be used as a source of information about sedimentation properties and governing mechanism of the cake formation. This will allow the obtention of the optimal parameters for the dewatering control and process optimisation. For this purpose, {{activated sludge}} at different concentrations was investigated on a laboratory centrifuge with centrifugation factor 2667. The following sludges were used in the experiments: 1) activated <b>sludge</b> from <b>thickener</b> (with and without floculant treatment); 2) sludge after industrial centrifuge decanter Flottweg Z 62 - 4 collected from dumping pound; sludge (2) after anaerobic treatment; sludge (2) with a dispersed solid additive. Based on the obtained data, the following assumption was made: settling of the solid phase and cake compaction depends on the hindered settling velocity and sediment compression. Due to the applied centrifuge force, a primary cake skeleton from particular aggregates and flocs is formed. During this stage, free water is displaced from the space between aggregates/flocs with a further transition to the compaction of the sediment with the water being displaced from the pores of the flocs by a filtration mechanism until an equilibrium condition is reached. The liquid volume V vs. time t at hindered settling and sediment dewatering can be represented in the form Vα tⁿ, where n ≤ 1. 0. Therefore, in log-log coordinates, the kinetics of liquid accumulation have a linear dependence lg(V) α n lg(t) in both settling and compaction stages. This assumption was confirmed for different types of activated sludge. Using asymptotical analysis in the function form F(t,V), a dimensionless fitting function was obtained that describes the centrifugation of activated sludge. For highly concentrated sludge, it was found that the dewatering occurs as cake compression. Analysis of deformation models leads to the conclusion that for the compressible cake it is necessary to introduce a parameter characterising the cake plasticity dependence on the centrifugation time. Developed model was used for fitting numerous experimental data. The main advantage of proposed model is the possibility to fit the liquid phase accumulation kinetics during centrifugation in a wide range of the activated sludge concentration, from suspension up to structured and paste-like cake consistency. The extension of this model to other slurries requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} effects of operational parameters on the prefermentation of primary wastewater sludge and the resultant wastewater characteristics changes at a full-scale in-line prefermenter, with due emphasis placed on the identification and resolving of practical problems. The settled sludge recycle flowrate was the main operational variable and the overall wastewater characterisation {{was based on the}} changes in the nutrients to carbonaceous material ratios across the prefermenter. The evaluation of prefermentation on wastewater nutrient ratio changes was performed under three different sludge operating conditions with regards to sludge elutriation rates, regulated at 0. 7, 2. 2 and 3. 7 kg sludge solids/m 3 raw sewage. The corresponding sludge ages at these elutriation rates were calculated as 17. 3, 2. 5 and 7. 5 days. At all three operating conditions the TKN/COD ratio increased (64, 46 and 20 % respectively), with an average ratio of 0. 057 mg N/mg COD in the raw sewage increasing to 0. 082 mg N/mg COD in the settled sewage. These ratio changes limit the use and performance of certain biological nutrient removal process configurations. Linear relationships were identified for constituent removal levels across the prefermenter. Associations were based on solids removal (settleable solids vs. suspended solids), COD to solids removal (COD vs. suspended solids), nutrient to COD removal (TKN and TP vs. COD) and ammonia nitrogen change (ammonia vs. TKN) across the prefermenter. Solids (settleable solids and suspended solids) and COD removals against the prefermenter solids surface loading rates were also correlated. Although the operational conditions varied over the experimental stages, the scatter of data points still formed in most cases distinct linear trends that were quantified with linear equations. This study has also highlighted the importance to counterbalance the requirements of fermentation with the requirements of solids thickening and solids removal at in-line prefermenters. The sludge management function at prefermenters is crucial in cases where the downstream waste sludge handling capacity is limited, usually due to the absence of additional <b>sludge</b> <b>thickeners.</b> In the full¬scale prefermenter the minimum suspended solids removal (33 %) was achieved at the lowest settled sludge solids content (4. 25 %), at a corresponding maximum volatile fatty acid process generation rate (5. 7 mg VFA/l/h). These opposing results demonstrated the need to find a proper balance between the various operational fermentation and solids handling requirements. The solid and volatile fatty acid concentration profile down the prefermenter tank depth was determined at a high sludge blanket condition to demonstrate that the constituent mass inventory is about constant throughout the water and sludge layers respectively. The use of on-line sludge level detection instrumentation proved to be very beneficial to monitor sludge blanket height variations. The on-line data availability of the prefermenter sludge content simplified sludge age determinations. The increased solids loading on the prefermenter due to the internal sludge recycle places a limit on the level of thickening and solids removal that can be achieved in an in-line prefermenter. This aspect is not considered in detail in the available literature. Preliminary calculations at the case study site indicate that at the typical raw sewage suspended solids concentration (425 mg/l suspended solids), a solids loading of about 83 kg solids/m 2 tank surface/d is created due to a sludge recycle rate of 0. 05 m 3 sludge/m 3 raw sewage. This is related to an elutriation rate of 2. 9 kg sludge solids/m 3 raw sewage and a 5. 6 % total solids recycled sludge concentration, resulting in an APT feed concentration of 3158 mg/l solids. It is assumed that the recycled solids consist completely of resettleable solids. Unpredictable solids carry-over at peak flow conditions indicated however that loss of solids settleability and resuspension of solids do occur. Inhibitory substances can reduce the VF A generation performance of a prefermenter due to consumptive VF A counter-reactions. Escalating levels of sulphate in the raw sewage at the prefermenter was identified as a possible contributing factor for the reduction in the VF A content of the settled sewage over the experimental period. The surface scum collection system, transferring scum gravitationally with settled sewage from the fixed scum trough to the waste sludge sump, can dilute and lower the thickened waste sludge concentration unnecessarily. This problem was resolved by returning most of the scum transfer medium (settled sewage) with a submersible pump to the inlet of the prefermenter. The impact of wastewater prefermentation cannot be evaluated in isolation, based on the local prefermenter VF A production rate alone. The nutrient ratios and solids removal changes in the settled sewage from a prefermenter must be considered when evaluating the downstream biological nutrient removal process. The type of the prefermenter configuration employed is considered to be the determining factor to ensure sufficient operational flexibility is available at the primary treatment section of a water care works.

A growingeconomy enhances the electricity requirement, product demands and so on, which affects both the surrounding environment but also the global environment. Wuhai is an industrial city and the most polluted city in Inner Mongolia, China. Numerous amounts of the industries are lacking in the emission treatment and the PM 10 is more then 10 times the allowed amount of European Union. This master thesis is a part of a bigger project, a corporation between IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute Ltd and Environmental Protection Bureau in Wuhai. The Coke Company Huaxi Jiohua Ltd. was founded 1992, and has a producing capability of 300. 000 tons coke per year. The treatment station is a model of an ASP, without a sludge recycling and a <b>sludge</b> <b>thickener</b> instead of sedimentation basin. The treatment efficiency is failing in phenol removal. The aim of this thesis is to perform a feasible study of the wastewater treatment methods foran improvement of the separation of pollutions in coke wastewater and to give a proposal forimprovement of energy efficiency from wastewater treatment. Treatment efficiency of methods such as A 2 /O, A/O, SBR, and ASP was taken inconsideration. Due to the lack of basic treatment, a first suggestion is to optimize the biological parameters,and introduce sludge recycling to the system together with either a following sedimentationpool or a MBBR as a pre-treatment step. To gain energy from the wastewater treatment station, a replacing of the current aerator system in the aeration unit to fine bubble diffusers and introduce a heat exchanger in the cooling of gas step could be done. www. ima. kth. s...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{denitrification}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} cost effective and widely used methods for nitrogen removal in municipal wastewater treatment plants. Under new stricter South East Queensland effluent guidelines the performance of wastewater treatment plants has to improve significantly to meet effluent total N restrictions of 5 mg N/L. The organic carbon contained in municipal wastewater that was utilised to carry out denitrification is often not sufficient to meet these stricter guidelines. As such the addition of an external carbon source is becoming a viable option to increase the COD (chemical oxygen demand) supply to a treatment plant to enhance denitrification. The choice of carbon source has long been a question of cost and performance. Often methanol has been the preferred choice of operators because of its relatively low cost per carbon mole, and the stability it provides with long term use. However other carbon sources are attractive in some cases because of their comparatively low cost, their ability to enhance denitrification. Such carbon sources include, among others, molasses and sludge hydrolysate. This thesis investigated the long-term effects of methanol, molasses and sludge hydrolysate on the performance and properties of denitrifying sludge when used as external carbon sources. Studies were carried out on both full-scale wastewater treatment plants and lab-scale reactor systems fed with real wastewater. The denitrification performance as well as a number of key properties of the sludges receiving an external carbon source were monitored and compared to those of a reference system. An effort was made to design fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) probes using the stable isotope probing (SIP) method for the measurement of the entire denitrifying community. In addition, the impact of various storage conditions on the maintenance of denitrification activities was investigated. The key outcomes are summarised below. Ethanol as an alternative carbon source for methanol adapted denitrifiers At the South Caboolture Water Reclamation Plant a 2 sludge post-denitrification reactor is used to polish the effluent before discharge, with methanol used as the primary external carbon source. The capability of the bio-films to denitrify with methanol, ethanol and acetate as sole or dual carbon sources was monitored for a period of one year using batch tests. On average the highest rates of denitrification were achieved using methanol, however ethanol supported denitrification rates were very similar to those with methanol (> 90 %). Acetate supported denitrification varied considerably during the study period being as low as 15 % of the average rate achieved with methanol, however after 2 weeks of ethanol addition the acetate supported denitrification rate had increased to be identical to the rate achieved with ethanol. The experimental results suggest that three functional bacterial groups were present within the microbial community of the biofilms, with the dominating group being able to use both methanol and ethanol as carbon sources for denitrification. The results of this study indicate that the use of ethanol as a short-term replacement for methanol in times of methanol unavailability is a sound operating option. Long term addition of molasses and fermented molasses: Impact on nitrogen removal and activated sludge properties The long term addition of molasses and fermented molasses were investigated for their impact on nitrogen removal and other operating parameters. The study was conducted in a bench scale SBR reactor operating as single sludge pre-denitrification system in parallel with a control reactor. The results of the study showed that fermented molasses was the better carbon source for enhancing nitrogen removal, removing 8. 69 mg N/L more than the control reactor receiving no external carbon at a COD addition of 100 mg TCOD per litre wastewater added. The long term addition of fermented molasses led to periods of bad settling however resulting in high SVI values throughout the addition period which appeared to be the result of the enumeration of filamentous organisms. Biomass washout was a feature of the long term addition of both fermented and non fermented molasses as a result of the poor settling. Long term addition of molasses/fermented molasses resulted in adaptation of the biomass, resulting in the biomass having an increased ability to denitrify with acetate, butyrate and wastewater COD. The use of either fermented and non-fermented molasses caused problems with the sludge settling characteristics of activated sludge in the lab scale SBR reactor. Long term addition of sludge hydrolysate: Impact on nitrogen removal and activated sludge properties The long term effect of the addition of sludge hydrolysate on the nitrogen removal and other operating parameters was investigated in this study. The study was conducted in a bench scale SBR reactor operating as a single sludge pre-denitrification system in parallel with a control reactor. The liquid from a rotary <b>sludge</b> <b>thickener</b> (RST) at a full-scale wastewater treatment plant was used as the hydrolysate. The RST liquid was found to contain a large fraction of volatile fatty acids, with acetate being the dominant species. The long term addition of the sludge hydrolysate was found to enhance biological denitrification with a removal rate of 3. 64 mg N/L with a hydrolysate addition of 40 mg COD per litre wastewater added. During the long term addition of the hydrolysate a decrease in the nitrification performance led to an accumulation of ammonium up to 30 mg NH 4 -N/L. It was unclear if this was a result of the hydrolysate addition. A period of 2 weeks was required for the nitrification performance to return to normal and the excess ammonium removed. The formation of pin flocs with poor settling was also a feature of long term hydrolysate addition which is potentially related to the addition of acetate in the hydrolysate. It would appear that high VFA containing sludge hydrolysates would make a better short term carbon source, in preference to long term addition. Impact of aerobic, anoxic, intermittently aerated and anaerobic storage conditions on denitrification activity of activated sludge The storage of excess sludge has been shown to be a reliable method for reducing the size of treatment plants. Under storage however the activity of bacteria can deteriorate. The rate at which this deterioration occurs is an important factor in determining the method of storage applied. This study investigated the impact of four storage conditions (aerobic, anoxic, intermittent aeration and anaerobic) on the activity of denitrifiers. The aerobic storage conditions yielded the highest VSS decay rate of 0. 028 d- 1, followed by the intermittent aeration (0. 020 d- 1), anoxic (0. 012 d- 1) and anaerobic (0. 009 d- 1) storage conditions. Storage under intermittently aerobic conditions resulted in the lowest denitrification rates measured in the study, with a maximum nitrate reduction rate of 4. 97 mg NO 3 -N/gVSS/h compared to the seed sludge nitrate reduction rate of 9. 62 mg NO 3 - N/gVSS/h. The storage of sludge under anoxic conditions yielded the most stable denitrification rates with a nitrate reduction rate almost identical to the rates measured on day 1 (6. 39 mg NO 3 -N/gVSS/h) even after 21 days (6. 97 mg NO 3 -N/gVSS/h). For each storage condition tested an unusual trend over the first 5 days was measured with the denitrification rates all increasing. After day 5 the maximum denitrification rates decreased with the rate of decrease varying dependant on the storage conditions. Modified 15 N-SIP method to investigate natural denitrifiers in activated sludge using carbon sources contained in wastewater 15 N-SIP is a SIP method which can be applied to complex microbial systems which cannot be targeted using a carbon based SIP approach. A methodology was developed for this study, which involved (1) identifying a method that could remove the ammonium contained in raw wastewater, while retaining a significant amount of the natural soluble COD to provide an 14 N-ammonium free wastewater feed source for the SIP incubation, (2) the incubation of a fresh sample of activated sludge from a full scale wastewater treatment plant with 15 NH 4 15 NO 3 to ensure only 15 N was supplied to actively growing bacteria under anoxic conditions, and (3) to carry out RNA SIP because it is considered a more responsive biomarker that labels active bacteria more efficiently than DNA SIP. The development of an ion-exchange column for treating the wastewater to remove the 14 N-Ammonium while retaining 50 % of the volatile fatty acids to provide a natural carbon feed source for the SIP incubation was achieved. The SIP incubation appeared to be successful based on the cyclic studies conducted over the course of the incubation. However, the complete analysis of the RNA samples collected could not be achieved because the labelling efficiency of the incubation could not be confirmed and the experiment was deemed unsuccessful. While the overall experiment was a failure it is believed that it would be possible to successfully apply this method in the future with the knowledge gained...|$|E

In this work the 2007 OCPWQ for Densadeg`s clarifier was analised. This equipment is responsable for treating Tavira`s WTP residual streams, under Águas do Algarve, S. A. management. It was observed that aluminum and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were operational critical parameters, whose recycling created concentrations above law limits for treated water. Trihalomethanes (THM`s) formation potential was indicated by specific ultraviolet absorvance (SUVA) parameter. Bibliography pointed that microbiological parametres are the most critical for WTP`s residual water recycle. The OCPWQ`s analisys did not show the same results.
