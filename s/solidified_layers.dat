In the present paper we develop a thermomechanical model which consists of two parts: a viscoelastic mechanical model for the calculation of stresses and a thermal model for the determination of the temperature field. Three types of inputs are necessary: processing parameters, material data (e. g., crystallization kinetics and rheology in the melt, the solid state and the transition zone) and heat transfer coefficients to describe the heat exchanges along the extrusion line.

The effect of the additive manufacturing multilayer feature on the molten pool dynamics, cooling rate, crystal size, microstructure morphology, micro-hardness and types of the residual stress has been investigated. It shows that the operating temperature and the thermo-capillary convection obtained within the molten pool generally increases as the processing multilayers are successively added, while the thermal effect depth is negatively reduced. The preferential direction of the heat diffusion generally changes from a downward pattern, then to the slightly strengthened horizontal direction and finally t o a typically horizontal one for various deposited layers being processed. Therefore, the microstructure of the solidified part along the building direction (Region I to Region V) undergoes an interesting transformation: directional columnar cellular microstructure, crosswise-extended cellular microstructure, refined cellular microstructure, fragmentation microstructure and the coarse cellular microstructure.

Methods: The Peng's multifunction operative dissector (PMOD) was modified to enable saline to effuse persistently out of its nib at a constant speed. In a group of six New Zealand rabbits, two hepatic lobes of each rabbits were resected respectively by SCEC and conventional electric coagulation (EC). The features of SCEC were recorded by photo and compared with conventional EC. After 7 d, the coagulating depth was measured in each residual hepatic lobe. Hepatic tissue was dyed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and studied under a microscope. Results: The coagulating depth increased with the continuation of SCEC time. Hepatectomies were performed successfully, no rabbit died in the perioperative period. The incisal surface of SCEC was gray-white with no red bleeding point. There was a thick <b>solidified</b> <b>layer</b> at the margin and a thin red-white intermittent <b>layer</b> between the <b>solidified</b> <b>layer</b> and normal hepatic tissue at the vertical section of SCEC.

40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} technologies fabricate objects layer by layer, adding {{material on}} top of already <b>solidified</b> <b>layers.</b> A key challenge {{is to ensure that}} there is always something below the layer being fabricated: otherwise added material simply falls under the effect of gravity [...] this is a critical issue with most technologies. This difficulty is typically treated differently for the interior and the exterior of an object: the exterior is supported through structures akin to scaffoldings that are removed afterwards, while the interior volume is filled with a sparse, self-supporting infill pattern. The infill acts as a support for the tops and also provides mechanical strength to the final print. However, as objects grow in size even sparse infills become prohibitively expensive in time and material usage, and if made too sparse they no longer provide the required support. This prevents printing large objects with empty interiors. In this work we investigate how to compute as large as possible self-supporting empty cavities. Our technique is based on an iterated geometric carving algorithm, that is fast to compute and produces nested sets of inner walls. The walls have exactly the minimal printable thickness of the manufacturing process everywhere. Remarkably, our technique only manipulates two consecutive slices of the model at a time, sweeping through the model along the vertical direction, from top to bottom. We discuss an efficient, robust implementation in details, based on a filtered polygonal medial axis extraction and an exact polygon offsetting technique. Using our approach, we can print large parts on filament printers using as little as a single filament thickness, providing on order of magnitude reduction in print time and material use while guaranteeing printability.

40|$|Layered {{manufacturing}} (LM) {{technologies are}} {{a class of}} additive manufacturing processes which create three dimensional geometries directly from CAD data sequentially layer by layer. This group of technologies can process a variety of metallic, polymer and ceramic materials, as liquids, powders, or solid sheets or filaments. The material can be processed using a laser, such as melting a powder or curing a polymer resin or consolidated using a binder deposited from a print head. The build methodology used in all LM is fundamentally a start-stop process since the deposition of material and processing of each layer occurs ~equentially. Hence, the build rate can be slow (2 - 6 Layers per minute); consequently, LM technologies have largely found application as prototyping tools to speed up product development. In order for these technologies to be adopted as rapid manufacturing (RM) methods to directly manufacture complex components which cannot be manufactured by other means these speed limitations need to be addressed. This Thesis describes a new high speed RM process, Spiral Growth Manufacturing (SGM), whereby 3 D parts are built by simultaneously depositing, levelling and selectively consolidating thin powder layers onto a rotating build platform. This build configuration has several advantages when compared to conventional layered manufacturing systems: firstly, the process is continuous with no layer preparation overheads; secondly, the material deposition and solidification process can be performed simultaneously {{by the addition of}} further 'build stations' radially distributed about the circumference of the machine. The work presented in this thesis focused on the design, development and testing ofthe Spiral Growth Manufacturing process. Two machines were developed; one used a bank of stationary inkjet heads to print material, either as a binder into a powder layer or as hard material from mixing two printed ink solutions and the other machine used a 90 W, flash lamp pumped Nd:YAG laser to process metal powders by localised melting.

40|$|The {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) industry is heavily employed {{in a wide}} variety of applications today. Initially, the different processes have been used for concept modelling and rapid prototyping but are now capable of building fully functional parts. Selective laser melting (SLM) is one of the rapidly growing technologies since its inception in early 2000 s. It creates parts by melting powder materials in layers using a laser heat source based on the information provided by a three-dimensional computer-aided design model. The parameters of SLM have been continuously optimised while attempting to produce fully dense parts comparable to the traditionally counterparts. This is an ongoing area of research due to the considerable number of variables involved in the process, including but not limited to powder material properties (powder deposition, particle morphology, particle size, particle size distribution and particle porosity), laser parameters (laser power, laser scan speed and laser scan spacing), and build chamber conditions (atmosphere, powder bed temperature and substrate plate preheating). Selective laser re-melting (SLR) is yet another approach visualised for improving the quality of SLM parts by integrating the laser surface re-melting (LSR) schemes into the SLM process planning. By re-melting every layer of a part, improved mechanical and physical properties can be obtained through decreased porosities. The re-melting process promotes grain refinement with a larger temperature gradient and balling within <b>solidified</b> <b>layers</b> is reduced leading to the reduction of pores and defects. However, the SLR technique further complicates the small SLM process window and requires careful selection of parameters for a successful build. Additionally, past SLR experiments employed laser powers less than 100 W as were made available with the older SLM machines. This study explores the effects of laser re-melting in SLM with varying energy density settings, establishing the process to structure and the structure to property relationships. Laser powers up to 375 W are used, with appropriate laser scan speed settings, ensuring the minimum energy densities as required for the laser melting of 316 L stainless steel powders. Microstructural analyses are performed on the cross-sectional areas of the parts evaluating the formation of melt pools and the structures within. Both mechanical and physical properties including surface roughness of the top and the lateral faces, hardness, tensile strength, and density are the critical responses measured and analysed based on experimental conditions with varying levels of laser re-melting. Other aspects such as the laser scan strategies and the build orientations are also given due considerations in the experimental designs. All the experiments are conducted on the Renishaw laser melting system. One of the main problems faced is that the re-melting approach led to excessive heating, bubbling and loss of the layer structures when attempted at the same original density levels as required for the first pass. This has led to limiting the energy densities in the repeated passes at either a half or a quarter of the original energy density level. Certain improvements are noticed from the laser re-melting process, though the end results are the combined effects of a number of factors. ...|$|E

This coupled system {{has the potential for}} instability. In this paper, the effect of Stefan number on the stability of unidirectional solidification is investigated, under the simplifying assumption that the solidified material is linear elastic. The Stefan number {{is a measure of the}} influence of thermal capacity on the solution and previous analyses have generally been restricted to the case of zero Stefan number, corresponding to a solidifying material of zero thermal capacity. This generalization necessitates a numerical solution, which is here implemented using the finite difference method. However, since the growth of the perturbation is linear, the two-dimensional stability problem is reduced to two one-dimensional numerical problems which can be solved sequentially. The results show that, in all cases, an initial sinusoidal perturbation grows to a maximum amplitude in the solidification front and then decays, the maximum being reached when the mean <b>solidified</b> <b>layer</b> thickness is about half the wavelength of the perturbation. In general, increasing Stefan number has a stabilizing effect on the process. This effect is most noticeable in cases where the zero Stefan number approximation predicts substantial growth of an initial perturbation, e. g. where the thermal contact resistance is very sensitive to pressure.
