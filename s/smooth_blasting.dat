In this situation, in the present study, a loop thermosyphon type cooling system, which is composed mainly of a heating block, an evaporator and an air-cooled condenser, is investigated experimentally in order to evaluate the cooling performance. At first, it is examined that the optimum volume filling rate of this cooling system is approximately 40 %. Next, four kinds of working fluids, R 1234 ze(E), R 1234 ze(Z), R 134 a and ethanol, are tested using a blasted heat transfer surface of the evaporator. In cases of R 1234 ze(E), R 1234 ze(Z), R 134 a and ethanol, the ef-fective heat flux, at which the heating block surface temperature reaches 70 ˚C, is 116 W/cm 2, 106 W/cm 2, 104 W/cm 2 and 60 W/cm 2, respectively. This result indicates that R 1234 ze(E) is the most suitable for the present cooling system. The minimum boiling thermal resistance of R 1234 ze(E) is 0. 05 (cm 2 ∙K) /W around the effective heat flux of 100 W/cm 2.

40|$|Background: Previously, we {{demonstrated}} that bone debris, which is translocated during dental implant placement, has osteogenic potential. Therefore, {{it was hypothesized}} that implant surface roughness can influence the amount of translocated bone debris/particles and thereby the osteogenic response. Material and Methods: Small titanium implants were left turned (<b>smooth)</b> or <b>blasted</b> and acid etched. The implants were placed in fresh cadaver bone. After explantation, the implants were incubated in a culture medium containing beta-glycerophosphate and dexamethasone up to 24 days. Subsequently, histology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), DNA analysis, and calcium (Ca) content measurements were performed. Results: For both types of implant during implant placement, bone particles were translocated because of inherent roughness of the implant. SEM and histology confirmed the presence of a bone-like tissue on the surface of both types of implants, as also confirmed by DNA and Ca measurements. However, the significantly higher roughness of the etched implants accounted for more bone debris and accordingly elevated osteogenic response. Control samples, which had not been placed into bone, did not show mineralization in the same medium. Conclusion: The present study, for the first time, {{demonstrated that}} implant surface roughness can increase the amount of the translocated bone particles and thereby also have a beneficial effect on the osteogenic response of these bone particles. It is hypothesized that these bone fragments behave like miniature auto-grafts and thereby play a significant role to enhance peri-implant osteogenesis.

40|$|The {{iron and}} {{steelmaking}} industry {{is among the}} major contributors to the anthropogenic {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} in the world. The rising levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere and the global concern about the greenhouse effect and climate change have brought about considerable investigations on how to reduce the energy intensity and CO 2 emissions of this industrial sector. In this thesis the problem is tackled by mathematical modeling and optimization using three different approaches. The possibility to use biomass in the integrated steel plant, particularly as an auxiliary reductant in the blast furnace, is investigated. By pre-processing the biomass its heating value and carbon content can be increased {{at the same time as}} the oxygen content is decreased. As the compression strength of the preprocessed biomass is lower than that of coke, it is not suitable for replacing a major part of the coke in the blast furnace burden. Therefore the biomass is assumed to be injected at the tuyere level of the blast furnace. Carbon capture and storage is, nowadays, mostly associated with power plants but it can also be used to reduce the CO 2 emissions of an integrated steel plant. In the case of a blast furnace, the effect of CCS can be further increased by recycling the carbon dioxide stripped top gas back into the process. However, this affects the economy of the integrated steel plant, as the amount of top gases available, e. g., for power and heat production is decreased. High quality raw materials are a prerequisite for <b>smooth</b> <b>blast</b> furnace operation. High quality coal is especially needed to produce coke with sufficient properties to ensure proper gas permeability and smooth burden descent. Lower quality coals as well as natural gas, which some countries have in great volumes, can be utilized with various direct and smelting reduction processes. The DRI produced with a direct reduction process can be utilized as a feed material for blast furnace, basic oxygen furnace or electric arc furnace. The liquid hot metal from a smelting reduction process can in turn be used in basic oxygen furnace or electric arc furnace. The unit sizes and investment costs of an alternative ironmaking process are also lower than those of a blast furnace. In this study, the economy of an integrated steel plant is investigated by simulation and optimization. The studied system consists of linearly described unit processes from coke plant to steel making units, with a more detailed thermodynamical model of the blast furnace. The results from the blast furnace operation with biomass injection revealed the importance of proper pre-processing of the raw biomass as the composition of the biomass as well as the heating value and the yield are all affected by the pyrolysis temperature. As for recycling of CO 2 stripped blast furnace top gas, substantial reductions in the emission rates are achieved if the stripped CO 2 can be stored. However, the optimal recycling degree together with other operation conditions is heavily dependent on the cost structure of CO 2 emissions and stripping/storage. The economical feasibility related to the use of DRI in the blast furnace depends on the price ratio between the DRI pellets and the BF pellets. The high amount of energy needed in the rotary hearth furnace to reduce the iron ore leads to increased CO 2 emissions...|$|R

40|$|Contour {{blasting}} {{is commonly}} performed by employing linear charges, decoupled from the boreholes. This method {{is common in}} surface and underground excavations, either for civil or mining purposes. To achieve the best results in terms of rock breakage and respect of the excavation profile, blasting theory suggests that charges should be inserted coaxial to the holes to grant uniform distribution of the explosive energy and therefore obtaining a uniform Radius of Damage. Nonetheless, due to readiness of operations or lack of availability of specific products on the market, non-coaxial charges are often employed in blasting practice. Non-coaxial charging methods include the employ of high-power detonating cord (40 to 100 g/m), low-power detonating cord connecting small-diameter cartridges (commonly 10 g/m detonating cord priming 1 " cartridges) or string loading (a thin layer of bulk emulsion pumped with controlled flow and controlled extraction of the injecting rod). This research focuses on evaluating {{the effects of the}} first two charging methods on the quality of final walls in open-pit and underground operations. Different drilling geometries and charging configurations were applied to both quarrying and tunneling blasts. The Half-Cast Factor (HCF), the Over-break (OB) and the Under-Break (UB) were evaluated as control indicators. Rock Quality Designation (RQD) and Rock Mass Rating (RMR) were used to classify the rock mass. The research was aimed to push contour blasts to their limits, observing for which geometry and charge configuration the blast lost its design threshold with respect to the final wall for every given rock mass. Results show the operational limits of non-coaxial charges encountered in the rock masses object of this study. In good-quality rock, <b>smooth</b> <b>blasting</b> with decoupled linear charge of 40 g/m can be extended to a spacing S = 22 Øf with little or no detectable drawbacks in terms of final wall quality, in contrast with theoretical formulae for the determination of the radius of damage.

40|$|Biomaterial surface properties, via {{alterations}} in the adsorbed protein layer, {{and the presence}} of specific functional groups can influence integrin binding specificity, thereby modulating cell adhesion and differentiation processes. The adsorption of fibronectin, a protein directly involved in osteoblast adhesion to the extracellular matrix, has been related to different physical and chemical properties of biomaterial surfaces. This study used blasting particles of different sizes and chemical compositions to evaluate the response of MG 63 osteoblast-like cells on <b>smooth</b> and <b>blasted</b> titanium surfaces, with and without fibronectin coatings, by means of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays. This response included (a) expression of the a 5, av and a 3 integrin subunits, which can bind to fibronectin through the RGD binding site, and (b) expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OC) as cell-differentiation markers. ALP activity and synthesis of OC were also tested. Cells on SiC-blasted Ti surfaces expressed higher amounts of the a 5 mRNA gene than cells on Al 2 O 3 -blasted Ti surfaces. This {{may be related to the}} fact that SiC-blasted surfaces adsorbed higher amounts of fibronectin due to their higher surface free energy and therefore provided a higher number of specific cell-binding sites. Fn-coated Ti surfaces decreased a 5 mRNA gene expression, by favoring the formation of other integrins involved in adhesion over a 5 b 1. The changes in a 5 mRNA expression induced by the presence of fibronectin coatings may moreover influence the osteoblast differentiation pathway, as fibronectin coatings on Ti surfaces also decreased both ALP mRNA expression and ALP activity after 14 and 21 days of cell culture.

Five rounds were performed by two types of detonators, each with a large-hole cut and perimeter holes in a 0. 4 m spacing. One is electronic detonators (EDs) which were used in the holes on the perimeter of the right half, the other is conventional pyrotechnical long period delay detonators of 0. 25 deci second interval (PDs) which were used in the holes on the perimeter of the left half. In order to compare the delay accuracy of two detonators, a series of stress measurement was performed from the tunnel wall. It was made clear that EDs had little influence on remaining rock and surface, and PDs generated a damaged region. The damaged region generated by PDs was within 1 m from the tunnel surface and vertical stress hardly acted on the damaged region. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{protective}} layer (PL) is commonly reserved above foundation surface {{to protect the}} underlying rock mass during dam foundation excavation. In China, the PL of dam foundation is conventionally subdivided into two or three thin layers and excavated with the shallow-hole blasting method, even by pneumatic pick method in case of soft rock mass. The aforementioned layered excavation of the PL delays {{the construction of the}} whole project. After nearly 30 -year practices, several safe and efficient methods for the PL excavation of dam foundation are gradually developed. They include shallow-hole bench blasting with cushion material (SBC) {{at the bottom of the}} hole, and horizontal <b>smooth</b> <b>blasting</b> (HSB). The PL is even cancelled on the condition that horizontal pre-split technique is employed during dam foundation excavation. This paper introduces the aforementioned two PL excavation methods (shallow-hole blasting and bench blasting) and horizontal pre-split technique of dam foundation without {{protective layer}} (HPP). The basic principles of blasting method, blasting geometry, charge structure, drill-and-blast parameters of typical projects are examined. Meanwhile, the merits and limitations of each method are compared. Engineering practices in China show that HSB is basically the optimal method for dam foundation PL excavation in terms of foundation damage control and rapid construction. Some new problems for dam foundation PL excavation arising, such as strong unloading and relaxation phenomenon that encountered in the gorge region of southwest China, are needed to be addressed; and the corresponding countermeasures are discussed as well...|$|E
40|$|This study {{applies the}} concept of the {{difficulty}} of tunnelling by drilling an blasting (D&B) to selected cases from the Brazilian tunnelling industry. The difficulty of tunnelling has been defined in previous work as the difference of specific drilling (SD) from industrial average trend: easier when SD is lower than average, more difficult when SD is higher than average. Results show how tunnels in Brazil tend to be unrealistically more difficult to excavate when compared to similar excavations in similar geologies elsewhere in the world. It is thoroughly discussed the reason for such anomaly (up to + 90 % SD compared to industrial average). One reason could be the lack of options amongst explosive products on the brazilian market. Only ANFO and explosive emulsions are available in Brazil. Lacking high VOD (Velocity of Detonation) products might result in reducing the maximum allowable burden amongst production holes, therefore increasing SD. Another reason could be found in the tunnel designers' tendency of choosing D&B as excavation method for weak rock masses that would benefit from mechanical excavation. The reason to this tendency can be partly found in the lack of availability of mechanical excavation machines in the brazilian market. Blasting in weak rock masses requires more careful <b>smooth</b> <b>blasting,</b> hence a closer spacing amongst contour holes to avoid costly overbreak: this increases SD. A third reason could be found in the lack of skill amongst the local workforce. When dealing with unskilled workers the blast designers naturally tend to avoid highly optimized blasts that require very skilled workforce to be realized on field. The designer in this case tends to leave the blast design simpler but more robust, at the cost of higher specific drilling and specific charge. The conclusions suggest that this unrealistic difficulty when compared to world average could be a simptom of the so-called "Brazilian cost" within the tunnelling industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of rock mechanical data {{is a fundamental}} {{step in the process}} of evaluating the profitability of an open pit mine. The steepness of bench, interramp and resulting overall slope angles have a direct effect on the stripping ratio, therefore on the profitability of the mining operation. With the recently challenging metal prices in mind, the maximization of slope angles is even more important nowadays, prompting detailed investigations in the topic. The primary goal of this master thesis is to provide updated rock mechanical design criteria for the Liikavaara Östra open pit in Northern Sweden, by collecting and assessing the already available information from the area, as well as evaluating the raw data of the drilling campaign undertaken in 2016. After the compilation of the rock mechanical and geological data of the site, the bench scale slope stability was assessed with probabilistic and deterministic approach. During the process, two failure criteria (Mohr-Coulomb and Barton-Bandis) and two groundwater conditions (drained and undrained) were tested. Based on the gained experience in the neighboring Aitik mine, the drained Barton-Bandis scenario was used both in probabilistic and deterministic approach to recommend bench face angles. Based on the findings of the bench slope analysis, an increase of the bench and interramp angles (compared to the previous design study) is possible, with the presumption of improved <b>smooth</b> <b>blasting</b> techniques and minimized back break. In identified areas with excessively poor rock quality, the application of external rock support was assessed in order to maintain reasonable bench angles and avoid mining of additional waste rock. The application of external slope support practices deemed feasible in the footwall domains of the pit, where with the utilization of support methods, the possible relocation of the E 10 road can be avoided. The overall slope stability was also assessed in the footwall with limit equilibrium analysis methods. The footwall of the pit was found to be stable with the new design criteria, although it is sensitive to the presence of groundwater pressures...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} a lot rock {{mechanics}} {{research has been}} conducted. One of the main subjects was the Excavation Damage Zone (EDZ). It was of importance because EDZ causes significant changes on mechanical properties, hydraulic conductivity, orientation of the stress field and many other parameters of rock around underground excavations. Some companies like ANDRA (Agence Nationale pour la Gestion des Déchets Radioactifs, France), UK NIREX (United Kingdom NIREX Limited) and SKB (Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co.) involved {{in the construction of}} underground spent nuclear fuel repositories have invested significant funds in these researches and extensive knowledge have been obtained in this field. However, most of the research has been concentrated on underground openings excavated with <b>smooth</b> <b>blasting</b> or TBM and very little has been done on drifts excavated in production conditions. Therefore the EDZ is of interest for LKAB (Swedish Co.) and it initiated a research project. Within that project the extent of EDZ was investigated by four different methods – Cross-Hole Seismic, Spectral Analyses of Surface Waves, Borehole Image Processing and Ultra-Sonic method. This thesis work deal with identification of extension of EDZ by diametrical measurements of p-wave velocity (Ultra-Sonic method) on rock cores delivered from the Kirunavaara mine. Diametrical measurements were carried out on cores from two types of rock – iron ore and host rock. To be able to pick up good acoustic signal a couplant have been used. Based on received data two types of analysis have been done – first analysis is based on coefficient of anisotropy, kv, and second is based on ration VPs/VPd. Results obtained during measurements revealed damage of rock in different scale, but the reason which caused that damage could not be identified. In heavily damaged rock the influence of couplant on results was noticed. For that reason some additional tests have been carried out – with saturated sample and Ultrasonic Gel as a couplant to see how large the influence is {{and to be able to}} estimate the real velocity of p-wave. Moreover there was a problem with getting signal on heavily damaged rock, therefore some study should be done to identify either it is problem of method or equipment. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a summary of}} the blast damage investigation carried out by SveBeFo (Swedish Rock Engineering Research) during the period 1991 to 2003 at various hard rock sites in Sweden. The objective of this report is to present a synopsis of the important factors that influence the development and extent of the blast-induced damage zone, nature and characteristics of blast-induced fractures, and {{a summary of the}} blast-damage thickness with reference to the existing perimeter blasting damage guidelines for tunnelling and drifting practices in Sweden. Ultimately this report will assist the author in developing numerical models to study the effects of blast-induced damaged zone on stability parameters. It has to be stated clearly that this report is intended as summary and not a reproduction of the works of SveBeFo. It may not also represent the actual conclusions or views of SveBeFo in areas where this author attempted to interpret and conclude from some of the data. Interested readers are strongly urged to consult the SveBeFo publications referenced in this report. The SveBeFo blast damage investigations during the period 1991 to 2003 were carried out at three principle hard rock sites: (i) Vånga granite quarry, (ii) LKAB's Malmberget and Kiruna mines and (iii) SKB's TASQ tunnel. The primary goal of these studies was to improve perimeter blasting guidelines for tunnelling and drifting in hard rock masses in Sweden. Within this scope were several objectives such as: (i) to develop guidelines for blast-induced damage control for drifting and tunnelling in hard rock masses, (ii) devise method for blast damage assessment, (iii) verification of the devised methods in tunnelling and drifting sites. Generally used perimeter blasting techniques, particularly <b>smooth</b> <b>blasting,</b> were employed in the tests. Multiple holes of different, but commonly used, diameters for perimeter holes were used. The explosives used were those commonly used for tunnelling and drifting. After the blasts saw cuts were extracted from the remaining rock, cut into manageable sizes, sprayed with penetrants (to make the blast-induced cracks traceable or visible) and crack parameters (length, quantity and pattern) investigated. The size and pattern of blast-induced damage were observed to depend on various parameters, namely; explosive parameters (explosive type, charge length, initiation method and coupling), blast hole pattern (burden, spacing and hole diameter), in-situ rock mass parameters (geology, in-situ stress, and rock strength and stiffness) and water in the holes. The thickness of the observed damage ranged between 0. 1 and 1. 2 m. An average damage thickness of 0. 5 m was observed in the Kiruna and Malmberget mine drifts and 0. 3 m in SKB's ÄSPE/TASQ tunnel and Vånga granite quarry. Godkänd; 2008; 20081114 (davsai...|$|E
