5|$|Aspect weavers operate {{by taking}} {{instructions}} <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> aspects, known as advice, and distributing {{it throughout the}} various classes in the program automatically.

Similarly, it should also be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> sections8 and 10.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal {{expanded}} the scope of judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive discretion. In contrast to the subjective test, the objective test permits the court to examine whether the decision-maker's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> the ISA. The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test was only part of the obiter dicta of the case. The ratio decidendi of the case was based on narrower technical grounds.|$|E
