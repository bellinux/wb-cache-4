Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely in the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
5|$|The port of Linnville was {{established}} on Matagorda Bay in 1831, {{and served as}} a main port for the Republic of Texas. The Great Comanche Raid of 1840 destroyed the town and forced the inhabitants to flee to the nearby Labbacca, which would later become known as Port Lavaca. Lavaca or la vaca, Spanish for cow, was founded {{in the wake of the}} Comanche Raid in 1841. It replaced Linnville as the main port on Matagorda Bay. However, the sandbar-heavy Lavaca Bay caused some navigational problems for ships. As a result, Lavaca was surpassed by Indianola as the main port on Matagorda Bay in the 1850s, even though the sandbars were dredged later in the decade. Indianola had been founded in 1846 as a landing place for German immigrants. It rapidly developed into a major seaport, and became the second largest in the state (after Galveston) by the 1860s. The two ports, and <b>strategic</b> <b>control</b> of Matagorda Bay in particular, became important during the American Civil War. Control of the bay shifted between the Union and Confederate forces several times. The Union presence in the area ended in June 1864. After the war, Indianola continued its growth, and had a population of 5,000 in the 1870s. A hurricane in 1875 caused massive damage to the city. It was rebuilt on a smaller scale shortly thereafter, but a second and more intense hurricane made landfall in 1886 (the fifth most intense in U.S. history), causing even greater destruction. The following year, Indianola was completely abandoned. Although Lavaca was also significantly affected by the hurricanes, it survived as a port, and again became the largest on the bay. It continues to hold this distinction today. It was renamed Port Lavaca in the late 19th Century. Palacios {{was established}} around 1901, and Port O'Connor was founded on the bay in 1909.|$|E

A number of these were published in German in the main psychoanalytic periodicals published in Vienna; these secured his status in Freud's inner circle during the period of the latter's increasing estrangement from Jung. In this context in 1912 Jones initiated, with Freud's agreement, the formation of a Committee of loyalists charged with safeguarding the theoretical and institutional legacy of the psychoanalytic movement. This development also served the more immediate purpose of isolating Jung and, with Jones in <b>strategic</b> <b>control,</b> eventually manoeuvring him out of the Presidency of the International Psychoanalytical Association, a post he had held since its inception. When Jung's resignation came in 1914, it was only the outbreak of the Great War that prevented Jones from taking his place.|$|E

500|$|Both sides {{attempted}} {{to justify their}} respective military goals in both active and reactive ways. The Roman quest for world domination {{was accompanied by a}} sense of mission and pride in Western civilization and by ambitions to become a guarantor of peace and order. Roman sources reveal long-standing prejudices with regard to the Eastern powers' customs, religious structures, languages, and forms of government. John F. Haldon underscores that [...] "although the conflicts between Persia and East Rome revolved around issues of <b>strategic</b> <b>control</b> around the eastern frontier, yet there was always a religious-ideological element present". From the time of Constantine on, Roman emperors appointed themselves as the protectors of Christians of Persia. This attitude created intense suspicions of the loyalties of Christians living in Sasanian Iran and often led to RomanPersian tensions or even military confrontations.* McDonough (2006), 73 A characteristic of the final phase of the conflict, when what had begun in 611612 as a raid was soon transformed into a war of conquest, was the pre-eminence of the Cross as a symbol of imperial victory and of the strongly religious element in the Roman imperial propaganda; Heraclius himself cast Khosrau as the enemy of God, and authors of the 6th and 7th centuries were fiercely hostile to Persia.|$|E

2500|$|Yield {{management}} is a variable pricing strategy, based on understanding, anticipating and influencing consumer behavior {{in order to}} maximize revenue or profits from a fixed, time-limited resource (such as airline seats or hotel room reservations or advertising inventory). As a specific, inventory-focused branch of revenue management, yield management involves <b>strategic</b> <b>control</b> of inventory to sell the right product to the right customer at the right time for the right price. This process can result in price discrimination, in which customers consuming identical goods or services are charged different prices. Yield {{management is}} a large revenue generator for several major industries; Robert Crandall, former Chairman and CEO of American Airlines, gave yield management its name and has called it [...] "the single most important technical development in transportation management since we entered deregulation." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on management control has {{for some time}} now argued for an integrated approach between strategy formulation and implementation. This thesis offers a sensemaking approach to understanding how such integrated activities in corporate organizations appear and can be enhanced. Without this understanding of sensemaking {{it has been argued that}} managers tend to control their organizations on the basis of qualified guesses or even illusions. ‘Sensemaking researchers’ have often approached their problems with a single perspective on cognition, language, or actions. Often the combination between these perspectives has been limited. This thesis offers a comprehensive dynamic model that combines these perspectives. Two research questions have been addressed: (1) How do actors in organizations make sense of <b>strategic</b> management <b>control</b> elements, (2) What forces influence the sensemaking process in the <b>strategic</b> management <b>control</b> context? The aims of this thesis are to: (1) Contribute to the understanding of sensemaking for <b>strategic</b> management <b>control</b> by providing rich and genuine narratives of these processes; and to (2) Improve the proposed conceptual model by data from the <b>strategic</b> management <b>control</b> context. Two firms have been included in this study. In one of the firms, a new <b>strategic</b> management <b>control</b> approach was developed to comply with a new growth strategy, and in the other firm new elements was added to the existing approach to conforming to new market conditions. The focus in the study has been placed on the sensemaking processes with regard to the elements in the firms’ <b>strategic</b> management <b>control</b> approaches. In sum twenty-two management control elements have been studied in the two firms. During a ten-month-period data was collected by: (1) interviews with 16 managers and employees on three different occasions (in sum 47 interviews), (2) observations from in round numbers 30 meetings, and (3) social network surveys. The data has been interpreted with the support of Perspective Text Analysis, Flexi- and Multigrid Analysis, and Social Network Analysis. The results of the study indicate that there is correspondence between the framework and the data and that the impact of sensemaking is high on <b>strategic</b> management <b>control.</b> Several explored forces have been added to the model. Accordingly, a contribution to the theory of sensemaking for <b>strategic</b> management <b>control</b> is presented in this research report. Godkänd; 2003; 20061106 (haneit...|$|R

2500|$|Shapur's ambitions when {{he succeeded}} his father Ardashir in 240 were no doubt {{inflated}} by his initial successes, {{but there also}} seems {{no doubt that he}} was determined to: (i) secure <b>strategic</b> <b>control</b> of the minor states of eastern Mesopotamia that controlled access to Roman Syria across the eastern desert-frontier west of the River Euphrates; and (ii) replace Rome by Persia as the hegemonic power of the Kingdom of Armenia. During the reign of Maximinus, Rome had suffered the loss of considerable territories in Mesopotamia to Ardashir which the Roman Emperor had been unable to prevent or avenge because of his internal distractions: on his accession, Shapur renewed the onslaught, capturing more of the Mesopotamian fortresses and penetrating Syria itself where Antioch, the capital of the Roman east may have come under threat. [...] More seriously, perhaps, the confidence of the Rome's governing elite that the Empire was capable of seeing-off the Persian threat to the Oriens was seriously undermined.|$|E
2500|$|Today, the Jardine Matheson Group {{is still}} very much active in Hong Kong, being one of the largest {{conglomerates}} in Hong Kong and its largest employer, second only to the government. Several landmarks in present-day Hong Kong are named after the firm and the founders Jardine and Matheson like Jardine's Bazaar, Jardine's Crescent, Jardine's Bridge, Jardine's Lookout, Yee Wo Street, Matheson Street, Jardine House and the Noon Day Gun. Jardines is also active in China, North America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East and parts of Africa. [...] It went through several major internal changes throughout the 19th and 20th century. [...] In 1947, a secret Trust was formed by members of the family to retain effective control over the company. [...] Jardine, Matheson and Co. offered its shares to the public in 1961 under the tenure of Sir Hugh Barton and was oversubscribed 56 times. The Keswick family, in consortium with several London-based banks and financial institutions, bought out the controlling shares of the Buchanan-Jardine family in 1959, but subsequently sold most of the shares during the 1961 public offering, retaining only about 10% of the company. The company had its head office redomiciled to Bermuda in 1984 under the tenure of Simon Keswick to maintain control after nearly being taken over by Chinese tycoon Li Ka-shing of Cheung Kong after a hostile raid in 1980. Li, who bought nearly 20% of the company at that time the largest shareholding in the company, agreed to sell his shares to Hongkong Land, a sister company of Jardines, at a premium. [...] Another reason for the move was fear of the Chinese take-over of Hong Kong and the threat of Chinese retaliation for Jardines drug smuggling past. [...] Subsequent events led to the cross-shareholding structure between Jardine, Matheson & Co. and Hongkong Land which was first instigated in 1980 by then taipan David Newbigging. [...] In 1988, instigated by Brian Powers, the first American taipan of Jardines, the entire corporate structure of Jardine, Matheson & Co., including all its allied companies, were restructured so that a holding company based in London and controlled by the Keswick family would have overall policy and <b>strategic</b> <b>control</b> of all Jardine Matheson Group companies. [...] The firm delisted from the Hong Kong Stock exchange (Hang Seng Index) in 1994 under the tenure of Alasdair Morrison and placed its primary listing in London and its secondary listing in Singapore. [...] The present Chairman of Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd. is Sir Henry Keswick, who is based in the UK, was the company's tai-pan from 1970 (aged 31) to 1975 and was the 6th Keswick to be tai-pan of the company. His brother, Simon, was the company's taipan from 1983 to 1988 and is the 7th Keswick to be tai-pan. Both brothers are the 4th generation of Keswicks in the company. [...] The firm's present managing director or tai-pan is Anthony Nightingale who is based in Hong Kong. [...] The organizational structure of Jardines has changed almost totally, but the members of the family of Dr. William Jardine still control the firm through a complex cross-shareholding structure, several allied shareholders and a secretive 1947 Trust.|$|E
