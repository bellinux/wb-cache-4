25|$|The Papanicolaou test (abbreviated as Pap test, known earlier as Pap smear, {{cervical}} smear, or <b>smear</b> <b>test)</b> is {{a method}} of cervical screening used to detect potentially pre-cancerous and cancerous processes in the cervix (opening of the uterus or womb). Abnormal findings are often followed up by more sensitive diagnostic procedures, and, if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression to cervical cancer. The test was invented by, and named for, the prominent Greek doctor Georgios Papanikolaou.|$|E

40|$|Recently, it is {{hypothesized}} {{that there might}} be an association between immunological disorders and cervical premalignant and malignant abnormalities. Related studies have been generally focused on some particular autoimmune disease, specially the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). This study aimed at comparing the rate of Pap smear abnormalities in female patients with autoimmune diseases and normal counterparts. In a case-control setting, 118 female patients with various autoimmune diseases (the case group) and 118 healthy female counterparts (the control group) were recruited in Tabriz Imam Reza Teaching Centre in a 24 months period of time. The two groups were matched for demographics and known risk factors of cervical malignancy. Frequencies of abnormal Pap <b>smear</b> <b>testing</b> were compared between the two groups. The autoimmune disorders were SLE (74 patients), rheumatoid arthritis or RA (32 patients), systemic sclerosis or SS (7 patients) and ankylosing spondylitis or AS (5 patients) in the case group. Frequency of abnormal Pap <b>smear</b> <b>testing</b> was significantly higher in the case group comparing with that in the controls (7. 6 % vs. 1. 7 %; p = 0. 03). Frequency of abnormal Pap <b>smear</b> <b>testing</b> was higher in the patients with SLE (8. 1 %) and RA (9. 3 %) comparing with that in the controls; However, these differences were marginally nonsignificant (p = 0. 06 and p = 0. 07, respectively). Frequency of cases with abnormal Pap <b>smear</b> <b>testing</b> was not statistically different between the autoimmune disorders (p = 0. 99). Based on these findings and in conclusion, there might be an association between the autoimmune disorders and occurrence of premalignant or malignant lesions in cervix.

40|$|Context: Although {{cervical}} cancer {{is an unusual}} cause of death among women 65 and older, most elderly women in the US report continuing to undergo periodic Pap smear screening. Objective: To describe the incidence of Pap <b>smears</b> and downstream <b>testing</b> among elderly women. Setting: Claims-based analysis of female Medicare enrollees age 65 and older. Methods: Using three years of Medicare Part B 5 % Files (1995 – 1997), we differentiated between women undergoing screening Pap smears and those undergoing Pap smears for surveillance of previous abnormalities or Pap smear follow-up. We determined the proportion of elderly women under-going Pap <b>smear</b> <b>testing</b> and rates of downstream testing and procedures after an initial Pap smear. Results: Four million female Medicare beneciaries over 65 years underwent Pap <b>smear</b> <b>testing</b> between 1995 and 1997, representing 25 % of the eligible population. After adjusting for underbilling for Pap smears under Medicare, 43 % of women over 65 are estimated to have undergone Pap <b>smear</b> <b>testing</b> during the 3 -year period.

In a quasi-experimental study in a target population of 2, 500 women, 237 completed pre-test measures to inform the intervention, and an educational brochure was distributed to all 2, 500. As a result, 510 women (20. 4 %) accepted free Pap smears.

40|$|Background: As one of {{the five}} most common cancers among Iranian women, {{cervical}} cancer is known to be preventable because of its long period of the pre-invasive stage, availability of appropriate screening tools, and effective treatments for early invasive cervical lesions. Screening is among the main measures to prevent the disease and Pap <b>smear</b> <b>testing</b> is an optional screening strategy for cervical cancer. Pop smear is a mass screening test. The current paper aimed to evaluate the levels of awareness and practice regarding Pap smear screening among women aged 20 - 65 years in Tehran (Iran). Methods: This was a descriptive-analytical study conducted in Tehran city of Iran in 2015. The research population included all married, widowed and divorced women aged 20 - 65 years. A questionnaire was used to collect data. Data analysis was performed using the Pearson correlation and t-tests in SPSS 23. It also worth note that a new variable which is labeled as Pop smear knowledge is defined by weighting four questions by the expert opinions. Results: A total of 66. 6 % subjects had Pap <b>smear</b> <b>tests.</b> There was a significant relationship between the awareness of Pap smear and educational level (of both wives and husbands). The people who have graduate degree, have the best awareness of pop smear. Also, {{there was a significant difference}} between housewives and working women in the level of awareness; working women revealed higher level of awareness about Pap <b>smear</b> screening <b>test.</b> Shame and fear of taking the cancer were the most common reasons which lead to avoidance in doing the test by the women, while the most encouraging factors for performing the test were the information mostly provided by physicians and after that, the information provided by friends. Conclusion: Due to the high prevalence of cervical cancer and the prolonged pre invasive course, the role of Pap <b>smear</b> <b>testing</b> for early diagnosis necessitate the use of proper and inexpensive instructional methods to increase awareness in women about cervical cancer and preventive strategies...|$|R
