5|$|The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> mark two {{arbitrary}} {{points of}} the plane (which will eventually become vertices of the triangle), and use the compass to draw a circle centered {{at one of the}} marked points, through the other marked point. Next, one draws a second circle, of the same radius, centered at the other marked point and passing through the first marked point.|$|E
5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The first <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so {{that they have a}} consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E
40|$|While lean {{programmes}} continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{implemented in}} many companies, {{there is a}} rising concern regarding the failures of these programmes. Many of them fail {{because we do not}} know how to implement them. Using the experience with a lean programme in an aircraft maintenance and repair operation, the purpose of the research <b>was</b> <b>to</b> develop an implementation model which consists of six critical decisions or steps. The first <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> perform strategic analysis which was driven by the market or the customer. The second <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> establish a high-level cross-functional team to drive the improvement initiative. The third <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> identify overall improvement tools. The fourth <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> perform a high-level value stream mapping and prioritise improvement opportunities. The fifth <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> develop a detailed plan for low-level improvement teams, and the sixth <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> implement, document, and revise as needed. Further, we provided important implications for both practitioners and academicians of our implementation experience with several directions for future research.

5000|$|O'Malley used {{black and}} white because it was less {{expensive}} than creating the series in color, and so O'Malley said that he [...] "embraced the B&W manga aesthetic". When writing the series, O'Malley's first <b>step</b> <b>was</b> developing {{the direction of the}} story by creating notes in notebooks, sketchbooks, and computer text files. His second <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create an outline. His third <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> write a script. His fourth <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> develop thumbnails. His final <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> develop the finished comic book page. To ink, O'Malley usually used brushes, including No. 2 and No. 3 brushes. He mostly used computers to build the screentone; he stated that he encountered difficulty finding screentone in North America. O'Malley himself created most of the Scott Pilgrim material. When production on Volume 6 had begun, O'Malley had hired two assistants. The backgrounds in Volume 6 are more detailed than backgrounds in the previous volumes. O'Malley said that [...] "most fans don't seem to notice the change".|$|R
5|$|First, the {{assigned}} herald develops a written description based on {{consultation with the}} petitioner. The petitioner then signs a contract with an artist at the authority to create the design. The Fraser Herald, serving as the CHA's principal artist, must review the design. At all stages the documents {{must be approved by}} both the petitioner and the Chief Herald. The final <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> prepare the letters patent, the official notice of an award of arms, which includes a drawing of the armorial bearings and the accompanying legal text and explanation of the symbolism of the bearings. Under Canadian bilingualism laws, letters patent are written in both English and French, though the petitioner may choose which language will be placed in the left column of the document.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Mr. Burns fires Homer for his laziness and incompetence. Looking for work, Homer answers a {{classified}} ad {{to become a}} grave digger. Meanwhile, Mr. Burns is nearing the completion of his giant robotic laborer, which he hopes will eventually replace weak-bodied human workers. The only remaining <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> implant a human brain into the machine's body. Searching a graveyard the following night, Mr. Burns mistakes Homer, snoring in an open grave, for a newly buried corpse and, despite signs that Homer may still be alive, removes Homer's brain with an ice cream scoop and places it in the robot. However, Robo-Homer is just as lazy and incompetent as he was as a human, using his X-ray vision to locate donuts. Mr. Burns declares the experiment a failure and, after restoring the brain to Homer's still-living body, kicks the robot, which topples over and crushes Mr. Burns. Afterward, he tells Smithers to get some surgical tools and ether.|$|E
5|$|The next <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> apply hair. The hair {{can either}} be done {{in one of two}} ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this program <b>was</b> <b>to</b> gather information to formulate a microwave absorber that can work {{in the presence of}} strong constant direct current (DC) magnetic fields. The program was conducted in four steps. The first <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> investigate the electrical and magnetic properties of magnetic and ferrite microwave absorbers in the presence of strong magnetic fields. This included both experimental measurements and a literature survey of properties that may <b>be</b> applicable <b>to</b> finding an appropriate absorbing material. The second <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> identify those material properties that will produce desirable absorptive properties in the presence of intense magnetic fields and determine the range of magnetic field in which the absorbers remain effective. The third <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> establish ferrite absorber designs that will produce low reflection and adequate absorption in the presence of intense inhomogeneous static magnetic fields. The fourth and final <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> prepare and test samples of such magnetic microwave absorbers if such designs seem practical...|$|R

5|$|To {{qualify for}} {{recognition}} by the American Kennel Club, a national breed club must first be established and a written request needs {{to be sent to}} the AKC along with a breed standard. This enables qualification for the Foundation Stock Service. The next <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> qualify to compete in the Miscellaneous Class. This requires a minimum of one hundred active members in the national breed club, along with a minimum of three to four hundred dogs in the United States with a three generation pedigree (all dogs in those pedigrees must be of the same breed). In addition, they must be geographically spread across twenty states or more, and finally the clubs by-laws and constitution must be reviewed as well as breed observations made by AKC staff. There is a typical stay of between one and three years in the Miscellaneous Class before full recognition is granted. During this time, the breed club must be seen to be active and hold seminars, matches as well as local and national speciality shows. The Kennel Club (UK) does not have a miscellaneous class or foundation stock service, instead it requires British bred dog and three generation pedigrees of them, along with details from the country of origin including the breed standard. This allows listing on the Imported Breeds Register, with full recognition granted at the discretion of the Kennel Club Review Committee.|$|E

Above-grade column reinforcing is constructed and enclosed by formwork and concrete is poured. After curing, the formwork is then removed. The next <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> build the roadway itself. The spans were cast in place, using extensive reinforcing, with post-tensioned cable tendons. The roadways consist of hollow box structures, cast in place in sections using formwork, owing both to the complex shapes involved {{and the necessity of}} maintaining traffic flow on adjacent structures during construction.|$|E
