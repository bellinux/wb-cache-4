50|$|In 1237, two villages with name Sajlovo (Hungarian: Zajol), Donje Sajlovo and Gornje Sajlovo, were {{mentioned}} {{to exist in}} this area.

5000|$|The <b>settlement</b> <b>was</b> {{founded in}} the early 20th Century, and like many other {{settlements}} in Argentina the original nucleus of the <b>settlement</b> <b>was</b> a railway station.

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name Glastonbury is unclear but when the <b>settlement</b> <b>is</b> first {{recorded}} in the 7th and the early 8th century, it was called Glestingaburg. The burg element is Anglo-Saxon and could refer either to a fortified place such as a burh or, more likely, a monastic enclosure; however the Glestinga element is obscure, and may derive from an Old English word or from a Saxon or Celtic personal name. It may derive from a person or kindred group named Glast.|$|E

50|$|The <b>settlement</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} {{known as}} Leskovec in the Middle Ages. The modern {{name of the}} <b>settlement</b> <b>was</b> changed from Sveti Peter pod Svetimi Gorami (literally, 'Saint Peter below the Holy Mountains') to Bistrica ob Sotli (literally, 'clear brook on the Sotla River') in 1952. The name was changed {{on the basis of}} the 1948 Law on Names of Settlements and Designations of Squares, Streets, and Buildings as part of efforts by Slovenia's postwar communist government to remove religious elements from toponyms. Locally, the <b>settlement</b> <b>was</b> known as Šempeter. The name Bistrica was originally a hydronym; the Bistrica River flows past the <b>settlement</b> and <b>is</b> a tributary of the Sotla River. In the past, the <b>settlement</b> <b>was</b> known as Sankt Peter bei Königsberg in German. During the Second World War, the <b>settlement</b> <b>was</b> temporarily renamed Königsberg am Sattelbach as part of the Rann Triangle (Ranner Dreieck) and designated for resettlement by Gottschee Germans.|$|R
