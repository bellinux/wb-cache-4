Though not displacing the s 140 statutory contract between members, <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreements</b> {{have a role to play}} both in direct contract between parties but also in setting reasonable expectations that may play a role in oppression actions or winding up on the just and equitable basis.

40|$|The {{unanimous}} <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreement</b> is {{a feature}} of most Canadian corporate statutes that allows the shareholders to, by creating an agreement meeting the necessary criteria, restrict {{the powers of the}} directors to manage the business and affairs of the corporation. One possible justification for this is the "nexus of contracts" theory that all corporations are notionally reducible to voluntary agreements. Three key areas of ambiguity surrounding unanimous <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreements</b> are examined in this dissertation, with specific reference to existing judgments. The requirements for their formation are reviewed, including the exact meaning and strictness of the unanimity criterion and the necessity and validity of possible restrictions upon the directors. Four competing approaches to their enforcement are identified and contrasted: the corporate constitutional approach that truly removes the board's powers, the contractual approach that treats unanimous <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreements</b> as contracts existing alongside the corporate power structure, and the directors' duties and oppression approaches that apply existing corporate law remedies to deal with violations. The transfer of duties and liabilities that accompanies unanimous <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreements</b> is considered in the context of unusual power structures and stakeholder theory, revealing unaddressed and possibly unsolvable problems in the legislation. It is concluded that, although the unanimous <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreement</b> may suggest a move toward a more contractual view of the corporation, it can also be understood as a specific tool within the statutory framework...|$|R

50|$|INA {{headquarters}} in ZagrebINA was established on January 1, 1964 through {{the merger of}} Naftaplin (company {{for oil and gas}} exploration and production) with the refineries in Rijeka and Sisak. Initially, the company was called “Oil and Gas Conglomerate” but on 26 November its name was changed to the one it has today. In 1990, INA became a state-owned company and in 1993 a joint stock company. The first stage of privatization, when MOL Company became INA’s strategic partner by purchasing 25% plus one share, was completed in 2003. Seven percent of shares were transferred to the Croatian Defenders’ Fund in 2005. After selling 7% shares to former and current INA employees, ownership structure of the company has changed and now less than 50% of total shares lie in state ownership. In this sense, the Croatian Government and MOL have signed the First Amendments to the <b>Shareholders</b> <b>Agreement.</b> In October 2008, MOL‘s voluntary public takeover offer to INA - INDUSTRIJA NAFTE d.d. shareholders was finalized.

50|$|Hydro Power Company Gorna Arda is a Bulgarian company, {{established}} in 1999 by the National Electricity Company and the Turkish Ceylan Holding. It is established after {{the signing of}} an intergovernmental agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey for a long-term barter. The Turkish side constructs roads and a cascade of hydropower plants in Bulgaria, and Bulgaria exports energy in return. Three hydro power plants are foreseen {{to be included in}} the cascade (Madan, Sarnitsa and Ardino), placed on the upper stream of Arda river. The groundbreaking was made in the end of 1999, planning to finish the construction of the cascade in 2006. Soon after that the project was frozen due to contradictions between the shareholders.In 2008 the Austrian company EVN expressed its interest in the Gorna Arda project. The company operates on the Bulgarian market since 2005 executing business activities in the field of distribution and trade of electricity in South-Eastern Bulgaria. On September 2, 2009 the government of the Republic of Bulgaria appointed Hydro Power Company Gorna Arda AD as the investor in the Gorna Arda Cascade. The Council of Ministers approved a letter of support for the realization of the investment project. This letter is not a state guarantee, does not burden the state budget and does not raise any financial obligations for the state. NEK, EVN and Alpine Bau expressed their wish to be shareholders in HEC Gorna Arda. In the beginning of 2010 Аlpine Bau reviewed its business development plans and decided to withdraw from the project. Thus only shareholders in the project left NEK and EVN. On July 19, 2010 in the Bulgarian Embassy in Vienna, in the presence of the Bulgarian Prime Minister Mr. Boyko Borissov, <b>shareholders</b> <b>agreement</b> for construction and operation of hydro power cascade Gorna Arda was signed. This contract arranged the collaboration base between NEK and EVN. On behalf Bulgaria the document was signed by Krasimir Parvanov, the CEO of NEK EAD, and on behalf of Austria it was signed by Burkhard Hofer, Chairperson of the Board of Directors in EVN. The establishment of the new company proves the will of EVN and NEK to restore a long time planned project for a hydro power cascade on the upper stream of Arda river in South-Eastern Bulgaria. At the moment the work is based on the technical redesign. The plan is in the region of Madan, Ardino and Kitnitsa to be constructed plants with total capacity up to 170 MW. Up to 350 GWh per year electricity will come from those plants in the Bulgarian network, this amount covers the electricity needs of over 100 000 households.|$|E
