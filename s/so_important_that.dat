5|$|For {{more than}} a millennium, silk {{remained}} the principal diplomatic gift of the emperor of China to his neighbors or to his vassals. The use of silk became <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> silk (糸) soon constituted {{one of the principal}} radicals of Chinese script.|$|E
5|$|At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof {{said that}} the videos {{originated}} from {{the question of the}} film's status as an Alien prequel. It was decided that creating videos with the film's stars would generate more interest than any commentary about its connection to the Alien films. He also {{said that the}} videos needed to be cool enough to justify their existence, but not <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> their absence from the final film would be an issue for audiences.|$|E

5|$|In 1585 the Flemish {{mathematician}} Simon Stevin {{published a}} small pamphlet called De Theinde ("the tenth"). Decimal fractions had been employed for {{the extraction of}} square roots some five centuries before his time, but nobody used decimal numbers in daily life. Stevin declared that using decimals was <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> the universal introduction of decimal weights, measures and coinage {{was only a matter}} of time.|$|E
5|$|The {{writing of}} Roa Bastos spans four countries, six decades, and countless genres. In his {{lifetime}} he made important contributions to Latin American Boom writing, to the related Dictator Novel, {{and to the}} Nuevo Cine film movement through screenplays like Alias Gardelito (1961). Roa Bastos' influence {{can be found in}} the works of many foreign post-boom writers, including Mempo Giardinelli, Isabel Allende, Eraclio Zepeda, Antonio Skármeta, Saul Ibargoyen, and Luisa Valenzuela. The most important author to come out of Paraguay, he also remains highly influential for a new generation of Paraguayan authors. Roa Bastos' relationship with his country, unbroken by over 40 years of exile, was considered <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> in 1989 he was invited back by Paraguay's new president, Andrés Rodríguez, following the collapse of the Stroessner regime.|$|E
5|$|While {{national}} security concerns were {{cited as the}} grounds for rejection, politics {{played an important role}} as well. The project, and the export issue associated with it, was considered <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> French President Georges Pompidou appealed directly to U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1971 to approve the deal, and Henry Kissinger brought the issue up with President Pompidou in a 1972 meeting. GE reportedly argued at the highest levels that having half of the market was better than having none of it, which they believed would happen if SNECMA pursued the engine on their own without GE's contribution. Nixon administration officials feared that this project could be {{the beginning of the end}} of American aerospace leadership.|$|E

5|$|Illness forced Mason to absent {{himself from}} the Committee of Safety for several weeks in 1775, {{and he did not}} attend the fourth convention, held in December 1775 and January 1776. With {{independence}} from Britain widely accepted as necessary among prominent Virginians, the fifth convention, to meet in May 1776 at Williamsburg, would need to decide how Virginia would be administered henceforth, as the royal government was dead in all but name. Accordingly, the convention was seen as <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> Richard Henry Lee arranged for his temporary recall from Congress {{to be a part of}} the convention, and Jefferson tried but failed to arrange to leave Congress as well. Other notables elected to the convention were Henry, George Wythe, and a young delegate from Orange County, James Madison. Mason was elected for Fairfax County, though with great difficulty.|$|E

25|$|The {{interest}} in sol-gel processing {{can be traced}} back in the mid-1800s with the observation that the hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) under acidic conditions {{led to the formation of}} SiO2 in the form of fibers and monoliths. Sol-gel research grew to be <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> in the 1990s more than 35,000 papers were published worldwide on the process.|$|E
50|$|Yellow - An even {{shade of}} yellow throughout. The exact shade is not <b>so</b> <b>important</b> as <b>that</b> the colour should be even and {{extend to the}} belly or {{undercut}} and no eye circles. In fact, a self colour free from chinchillation on cheeks and hind feet. Eyes hazel.|$|R
40|$|These {{notes are}} {{concerned}} with initial value problems for systems of ordinary dif-ferential equations. Here our emphasis will be on nonlinear phenomena and properties, particularly those with physical relevance.

25|$|Mulder {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in the first season pilot episode, broadcast in 1993. Mulder believes in extraterrestrial unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and a government conspiracy to hide or deny the truth of their existence. Mulder considers the X-Files and the truth behind the supposed conspiracy <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> he has made them {{the main focus of}} his life.|$|E
25|$|The fly motif is <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> it {{remained}} {{in his work}} until after {{he moved to the}} West. The 1992, installation in Cologne, Life of Flies, consists of several halls in which the economy, politics, culture, and an entire civilization, specifically the Soviet Union, are associated with flies. The civilization has an atmosphere so boring that flies die from it. Throughout Kabakov’s oeuvre the flies represent two seemingly different themes: human lives and garbage.|$|E
25|$|As {{found in}} Genesis 17:1-14, brit milah is {{considered}} to be <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> should the eighth day fall on the Sabbath, actions that would normally be forbidden because of the sanctity of the day are permitted in order to fulfill the requirement to circumcise. The Talmud, when discussing the importance of Milah, compares it to being equal to all other mitzvot (commandments) based on the gematria for brit of 612 (Tractate Nedarim 32a).|$|E
6000|$|... 'Can't {{you imagine}} the old beast?' said Dallas, pathetically, 'Can't you see him getting round the Old Man?

The abandoned old wreck!' ...|$|R
40|$|Lewis and Charny {{have come}} under siege for {{suggesting}} remote questioning to decide appropriate medical care. While the criticisms are theoretically valid, the idea is <b>so</b> <b>important</b> practically <b>that</b> Lewis and Charny should be supported and their approach investigated {{as a way of}} making medical treatment at least more open and possibly more fair...|$|R

25|$|Between 14 and 21 July 1951, Nichols and the 6004th {{actually}} {{managed to}} retrieve a crashed MiG-15 from behind enemy lines. The MiG-15 in question had crash-landed onto mud flats south-west of Hanch'on. The intelligence coup was considered <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> it {{was supported by a}} small multi-national fleet of South Korean, U.S., and British vessels under the command of British Rear Admiral A. K. Scott-Moncrieff. Despite his relatively junior rank, Nichols was credited with organizing the operation.|$|E
25|$|Richmond's {{campaign}} team {{erupts in}} cheers when they learn Richmond and Adams are now {{close in the}} poll numbers. He receives a phone call, asking what the caller wants as he watches Gwen and Jamie talk. Richmond's driver drops him off {{at the house of}} Jamie's grandfather, Ted Wright (Marcel Maillard). Jamie later arrives and asks his grandfather what was <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> he needed to talk to him, then he sees Richmond, who asks Jamie why he lied to him.|$|E
25|$|The second problem, the {{exhaustion}} of the high-content surface ores, required technological innovations. Hydraulic power took on increased importance {{because of the}} construction of large refining centers. By 1621 a system of artificial lakes with a storage capacity of several million tons provided a steady supply of water for refineries. With the labor and technological problems resolved, silver mining flourished. By the middle of the 17th century, silver mining at Potosí had become <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> the city had the largest population in the Western Hemisphere, approximately 160,000 inhabitants.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between pet shows and pet fashion shows. The pet fashion show's emphasis is on the clothes, not on the dog. In countries all over the world, pet fashion shows are becoming increasingly popular they have become <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> in 2011 New York hosted the first Pet Fashion Week called Last Bark at Bryant Park. During these shows, well groomed pets strut down the runway wearing high fashion clothes. Some well known designers such as Alexander Wang have designed outfits for the dogs.|$|E
25|$|Soviet forces {{tried to}} lift the siege, which was causing severe damage {{to the city and}} losses in {{civilian}} population. The Road of Life was frequently disabled by regular German airstrikes. Several smaller offensives were launched in 1942 in the region, but failed. The last offensive near Lyuban resulted in the encirclement and destruction of most of the Soviet 2nd Shock Army. Nevertheless, the opening of a supply route to Leningrad was <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> preparations for the new operation began almost immediately after the defeat at Lyuban.|$|E
25|$|The Gemarah of the Babylonian Talmud {{contains}} homiletic {{descriptions of}} the importance of the practice, including an argument that washing before meals is <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> neglecting it is tantamount to unchastity, and risks divine punishment in the form of sudden destruction or poverty. The discussion of mayim acharonim, washing after meals, contains a suggestion that washing after meals, as a health measure, is the more important of the two washings, on grounds that the salt used as a preservative in food could cause blindness if the eyes were rubbed without washing.|$|E

50|$|What {{makes this}} part of the {{spectrum}} <b>so</b> <b>important</b> is <b>that,</b> while far-infrared and submillimeter light can penetrate dust clouds, half or more of the optical and ultraviolet light produced in the universe is absorbed by dust and reradiated in the far-infrared and submillimeter. Even in our local area of the universe, many galaxies are so dusty that they radiate mainly at those wavelengths.|$|R
